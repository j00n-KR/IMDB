0,SnoopyStyle,Struggling late 20s comes to life,7,12 April 2014,Frances Halladay (Greta Gerwig) is 27 and living in NYC with her best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner). She is trying to be a dancer but can't get anything better than being an apprentice. Sophie is moving on with her life but Frances is flailing around. Frances just can't quite advance in her life.I didn't really like her aimless struggles. Frances is very random and she's actually quite alone when the girls separate. I felt very bad for her. The only saving grace is the magnetic Greta Gerwig's performance. It's always great to root for her. The dinner scene is awkwardly wonderful. Her craziness is deliciously shocking. And I do love when Sophie comes back into the movie. It's a rewarding watch.,Frances Ha
1,Horst_In_Translation,Moving and realistic,8,15 August 2015,"I am probably going to watch Noah Baumbach's newest ""While We're Young"" tomorrow, so why not give one of his other films a watch as an appetizer. I watched ""Frances Ha"" in theater shortly after it came out pretty much exactly 2 years ago and I remember really enjoying it. None of this is lost on rewatch. I have a soft spot for modern black-and-white movies and this one is no difference. I felt there was something truly raw and authentic about everything in here, especially the characters' interactions and dialogs. Apart from that, there is some great music in here, especially the David Bowie song, but also ""Everyone's a Winner"". Lead actress Greta Gerwig scored a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal here and it was very deserved I must say, especially as she also came up with the excellent script. I don't want to quote many parts of this film that I found particularly successful, but I have to mention Frances' monologue at the dinner party which was just an amazing piece of acting and storytelling and, of course, the reference to that in the last scene of the movie is also spot-on.It is probably not my number 1 favorite film from 2012, but it's possibly the one film from that year that succeeds the most at combining drama and comedy. There are not that many dramatic moments, but her general life struggles and also crumbling relationships certainly deliver. And this is also a truly hilarious film. Frances is such a goofy, likable, relatable character that it's a complete joy to watch her, for example when she sleeps all the time when she is in France. The restaurant scene was excellent with her running off to get some money to pay. Or the quotes are sometimes hilarious too, for example about a certain French writer being ""heavy"". It's all very smart, yet never full of itself. It was such a joy to watch Frances have a great night at one point when her new friends ask her to dance and she dances all the way home as well. I would almost want to call this film a must-see, especially for filmmakers who want to come up with a quality comedy film. These 80 minutes (very short film, never drags for a second) were a wonderful experience and I truly hope that Baumbach and Gerwig can repeat this achievement as often as possible. Highly recommended.",Frances Ha
2,kosmasp,Life as she knows it,8,4 August 2013,"Greta Gerwig seems to be ideal for weird. And I mean that in a good sense. The role she plays could not have been cast better. I cannot imagine anyone else playing that character. Frances is a very unique and special character with her own view on things, that may open peoples minds to a few things.But even if you're not in the mood to think too much (though watching this it should be something to consider), you can just enjoy its weirdness. I'm not saying you should live your life like her or take advice from the movie. But it is very refreshing to see something, that is not very obvious. I couldn't tell where the movie was going, but it was interesting to find out. And while some might find this boring, others will rejoice",Frances Ha
3,gavin6942,The World of Noah Baumbach,7,7 April 2015,"A story that follows a New York woman (Greta Gerwig) who does not really have an apartment, apprentices for a dance company though she is not really a dancer, and throws herself headlong into her dreams, even as their possibility dwindles.Did you know Gerwig was in ""The House of the Devil"" (2009)? Frankly, neither did I. But she was. And then she really broke out with this film... though broke out where is unclear, because as of 2015 we have yet to really see her in anything big. Hopefully soon, though, as she seems quite interesting.What I like about this film is that it harks back to the 80s and 90s independent films of Jim Jarmusch. Baumbach is sort of thought of as an associate of Wes Anderson, and is probably best known for ""Squid and the Whale"". Both that and this are quirky, but in different ways. This one feels like a true independent film and is the greater of the two.",Frances Ha
4,Quinoa1984,"arguably the wisest, freshest and funniest look at 'Moving on into life' for my generation",10,8 November 2014,"I wasn't sure where Baumbach was going with his run of films since he made a big favorable impression with The Squid and the Whale. Margot at the Wedding and Greenberg had their moments of genuine humor but were marred by a personality to the films that was sour and sad, but not for the benefit of the stories being told. All the more-so this made Frances Ha all the greater a massive 'where did THAT come from(!)' not unlike James Wan with the Conjuring last year (though I knew Baumbach has had the talent for such films). This time he paired up with an incredibly charming, comedic at times yet dramatically solid Greta Gerwig as his muse (see-ya Jennifer Jason Leigh!), and it's a excellent marriage of creativity with a once-mumblecore darling.It's a pretty basic story on the surface where Frances (Gerwig) has to figure out her life after she loses a job and her apartment – one in the course of a few in the film – and it's probably the most accurate depiction of late 20's malaise and odd humor in the face of adversity living in New York I've seen, more than, say, HBO's Girls. The tone has whimsy provided by the music, which is all from French New Wave movies by Georges Delerue, and the black and white cinematography brings out an innocence to the material, or at least nothing looks exactly TOO contemporary.Frances' struggle to make it as a dancer and maintain her friendship are what counts most feels timeless the way it's presented – a relationship with a man may come up here and there but it's really more minor – and when it means to be funny it can deliver some laughs Between Gerwig's charming performance and Baumbach's handling of the material, it's by far his most rewarding film and a response to a lot of hipster drivel that makes me (being in that age group) squirm.",Frances Ha
5,writers_reign,Old Waves In New Bottles,5,26 July 2013,"There's a lovely irony at work here that may well be lost on co- writer/director Baumbach. In a dinner party scene the protagonist Frances makes a rambling speech that is meant to illustrate how immature she remains at age twenty-seven whilst the whole FILM reveals how immature Baumbach remains at forty plus. For reasons best known to himself he is obsessed with one of the greatest cons of the twentieth century, the so-called New Wave which lasted five years tops in the late fifties, early sixties until it was tsunamied aside by REAL filmmakers old and new. Today -apart from Baumbach - you can examine the output of current French filmmakers - Alain Corneau, Bertrand Tavernier, Francis Weber, Marion Vernoux, Tonie Marshall, Nicole Garcia, Anne Fontaine, Guillaume Canet, Gerard Jugnot etc and you won't find one single frame influenced by the New Wave on the contrary all these directors - many working from their own scripts - are turning out films that could just as easily have been made in the thirties, forties and early fifties. Still, if Baumbach wants to litter his movie with 'homages' to Truffaut, Godard and the like that's his problem. The King's new clothes are always on display and alas, not enough small boys are prepared to draw attention to this.",Frances Ha
6,george.schmidt,Gerwig at her most socially awkward and her generation's Diane Keaton; a gem.,9,15 May 2013,"FRANCES HA (2013) ***1/2 Greta Gerwig, Mickey Sumner, Adam Driver, Michael Zegen, Grace Gummer, Charlotte d'Amboise, Michael Esper, Patrick Heusinger, Josh Hamilton, Britta Phillips, Juliet Rylance, Dean Wareham, Maya Kazan. Echoes of Woody Allen's MANHATTAN ring out in this funny, romantic comedy of errors involving Gerwig (at her most socially awkward and her generation's Diane Keaton) whose flibbertigibbet titular heroine finds herself attempting to deal with her fledgling career as a modern dancer in NYC while coming to grips with her super close relationship with her bestie Sumner (a true revelation) who is all in tense and purposes her soulmate (w/o the lesbian angle). Fresh, sharp, witty and too-close-to-the-bone screenplay by Gerwig and filmmaker Noah Baumbach who collaborated on the script with her allows a showcase for her warts-and-all persona and surrounds her with some quirky, fun-loving characters including Zegen as one of her rich roomies (he steals the film). Gorgeous black and white cinematography by Sam Levy gives the film a timeless quality. Best scenes: Frances' run thru the streets with David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" on the soundtrack and her wonderful speech on realizing what love really is. A gem.",Frances Ha
7,evanston_dad,Dreaming the Impossible Dream,7,7 December 2013,"I'm at a phase in my life where I generally have little patience for stories about adults who refuse to grow up. So I had some frustration with ""Frances Ha,"" in which Greta Gerwig plays a woman child who crashes with friends and sticks to her increasing unrealistic dream of being a dancer. But what saved ""Frances Ha"" for me was that I suspect Gerwig (who co-wrote the script with director Noah Baumbach) and Baumbach intend for us to be frustrated with Frances too. Life is a lot about compromise, and that's something that Frances won't accept until the film's end -- it's not all or nothing, and life can be satisfying without being a dream come true.One of the things that did irk me about the movie was its implication that anyone who does seem to have his/her life together is either faking it, skating by on rich parents or vapid. It is actually possible to be both responsible and happy, something that movies, particularly a certain kind of indie movie (of which ""Frances Ha"" is an example), is reluctant to accept. But I still liked the movie despite its decision to perpetuate that message.I can't decide whether or not I like Greta Gerwig, which makes her perfect casting for this role. Something about Frances is warm and winning, but something else is just as annoying. You understand both why people are drawn to her and turned off by her, because that's how I feel about her as an actress.Grade: A-",Frances Ha
8,ferguson-6,The Unbearable Lightness of Frances,5,30 May 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. All the critics are raving about it. Love abounds for the latest from director Noah Baumbach and his co-writer and leading lady Greta Gerwig. What makes my ambivalence even more confounding is that I'm a fan of Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) and Gerwig (Greenberg). The expert level of filmmaking and acting is obvious, the script details and dialogue are exceptional, and the situations and setting are realistic. So why aren't I more excited about this one? That's what I've spent the past few days wondering.It seems Frances Ha delivers everything I look for in an indie film. The problem is that I find almost every character to be annoying and self-absorbed. The first act finds Frances (Gerwig) sitting on top of the world. She has a boyfriend, a BFF/roomie, and is a dance company apprentice with the expectation of a dance career. Soon enough she watches Strike Three go by and her world is in a tailspin. We then watch Frances trudge on through uncertainty and instability in living arrangements, personal relationships and career path. It plays like a road trip that really never hits the highway.Frances moves in with Lev (Adam Driver) and Ben (Michael Zegen) and she is oblivious to Ben's interest as she obsesses about her former BFF Sophie (Mickey Sumner). See, Sophie is trying to grow up while Frances wants to stay in her dream land where she and Sophie remain ""the same person with different hair"". Frances then crashes at the apartment of a fellow dancer played with all seriousness by Grace Gummer (Meryl Streep's daughter). The two dancing opposites attend an awkward dinner party at which Frances manages to spew an endless stream of absurd remarks that advertise her lack of maturity. Her response to this is to take a spontaneous trip to Paris ... charged to a new credit card.Make no mistake. Frances is a very energetic and sincere free-spirited twenty-seven year old. The kind that is only charming in the movies. If her quirk wins you over, you will find yourself rooting for her to get her life together. That would put you in the same corner as most other film critics. On the other hand, if you recognize the optimism, but are unmoved by the immaturity and self-absorption, then you are banished to the corner of those who ""just don't get it"". And I'll be right there with you.",Frances Ha
9,zetes,Wonderful,10,2 June 2013,"Another story of arrested development, a common theme in American cinema today, mostly because it's a common theme in America's youth nowadays. Which is not to blame them. The culture is changing, and history will see the shift as part of the economic problems of recent times. We're not done with it yet. Yes, Frances Ha has some themes we've seen before, and, in all honesty, it's a pretty slight and predictable film. I loved it. Yes, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but it's incredibly alive and enjoyable. Most of its greatness comes straight from its star and co-writer, Greta Gerwig, who plays the title character (her last name isn't Ha, but the revelation of the film's title is probably its finest moment, so I'll leave it for you to discover), a 27 year-old New Yorker who is perpetually an intern at a dance company. She makes little money, and she's on the verge of making nothing. Her best friend, Sophie (Mickey Sumner), whom Frances often refers to as ""the same person as me"" or her lesbian lover but without the sex, is actually making something of herself, and their close bond breaks when she announces that she's moving in with someone else, to a neighborhood Frances could not possibly hope to afford. Heartbroken, Frances wanders through the city, stopping and living at various friends' apartments as she tries to figure out what to do with her nebulous existence. The film is witty, lovely and, as light as it is, deeply involving. Plenty of people will know exactly how Frances feels. If you were ever at this point in your life, you'll find so much truth in the movie. Gerwig is utterly wonderful. It was obvious in Baumbach's previous film, Greenberg, but she absolutely cements her status in the cinematic world here. She is one of the freshest American actresses around, and I hope she sticks around for a long, long time. This might very well be my favorite film so far of the year.",Frances Ha
10,StevePulaski,The obligation of growing up,9,9 June 2013,"Is it fair to call Frances Ha a product of the mumblecore movement in cinema or is it all too, well, professional? Noah Baumbach's examination of culture, early adulthood, and obsessive friendships not only makes for a good, topical debate but a very worthy motion picture, as Frances Ha is one of the strongest films this year. Heavy on dialog, characterization, and the strong, stable topics to examine, this is a thoughtful mediation on what it means to grow up, stay true to your friends, and be self-reliant.The film stars the zealous Greta Gerwig (whose work in Hannah Takes the Stairs I still regard as terrific) as the title character, a plucky dancer at the age of twenty-seven, living with her best friend Sophie (Mickey Summer) and her best guy-friend Benji (Michael Zegen). Frances and her friend Sophie are like ""straight lesbians,"" so Benji says, as they do everything together, and both of them would seemingly be lost without each other. The thought is put to the test when Sophie decides to move out of the cramped studio apartment in favor of moving in with another friend, leaving Frances sort of lost and unfulfilled with her current position in life.This is basic framework for a story that begins to follow the path of a series of vignettes, focusing on the ups and downs in life, along with those awkward stretches no one really likes to talk about. Baumbach brilliantly captures this through a black and white lens, and allows his actors the freedom to get immersed in their characters with little restrictions in place.Frances Ha does a lot in eighty-six minutes, like notably humanizing the ""hipster"" culture of the last few years, detail loneliness and friendships, impending adulthood, and dependence all the more. The humanization of ""hipster"" culture comes into play because we notice that these characters are not of the ""typical"" breed, whatever we define as typical. They are about as free and unrestrained as the wind that catches their hair, especially Frances herself, who is arguably one of the most fun characters I've had the pleasure of watching this year. There's something about the way she engages in quick-witted conversation, runs happily through the streets of Chinatown at random, and is constantly proclaiming she is ""undateable.' Gerwig magically transforms a character bound for a caricature state of mind into a strong woman that may not be looked at as a role model for girls but certainly a realistic portrayal of many.I imagine the loneliness that the loneliness and slight-depression Frances feels when Sophie leaves her is one many post-college girls will feel when their best girlfriend moves on to bigger and better things and she remains somewhat inert and stuck in her current life position. Baumbach details growing up in Frances Ha not as a choice but as an obligation, which it rightfully is in many regards, but the way he doesn't isn't condescending or superficial, but rather hopeful and endearing.NOTE: My video review of Frances Ha, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6LbMzbGww Starring: Greta Gerwig, Mickey Summer, and Michael Zegen.

11,lasttimeisaw,The film tries its best to leave out an authentic character on the screen with a piquant personal spin.,7,10 February 2015,"My second film of the NYC indie director Noah Baumbach, after his much-acclaimed indie darkhorse THE SQUID AND THE WHALE (2005, 9/10), although his muse has shifted from Jennifer Jason Leigh to the new indie-hotshot Greta Gerwig now, who stars as the titular protagonist and is the co-writer of this film. Shot entirely in Black & White (or more specifically, it is digitally shot first and then transmuted into monochrome to discharge a feeling of nostalgia), the opening montages snappily show audiences the intimate friendship between Frances Ha (Gerwig), a 27-year- old amateur dancer in NYC, and her best friend Sophie (Sumner), and they have been inseparable since college and share an apartment as well. Ten minutes later, Frances flippantly breaks up with her boyfriend Dan (Esper) simply because she cannot accept Dan's proposal of living together in his place as she still prefers to live with Sophie. So, it goes without saying that Frances is a quirky girl who has never really matured into adolescence, as she jests, ""I'll be the girl with acne and holding more acnes"", she and Sophie are both straight, thus their affinity is just like two lesbians who do not have sex. But Sophie is not as a constant as Frances, she is a variable, pretty soon, she needs to get rid of Frances and pursues her ideal goal of life, living in a better apartment, finding a matching boyfriend, and eventually relocates to Japan with him. It should be and actually it is a tough blow for Frances, yet, as jaunty as her, she will not be beaten up by it, although the wound is deep enough for her to wantonly set up a weekend sojourn alone in Paris against her poor financial status and the dim future as a professional dancer. Meanwhile, there are boys around her, a former roommate Benji (Zegen) habitually refers her as ""undateable"" while constantly conveys the impressions that he has a certain feeling for her. But for Frances, boys is never a big problem, herself, is the real mess, and too much self-concerned in the fallout with Sophie. A sudden career debacle forces her to moonlight in her alma mater, and unexpectedly, she meets Sophie again and they mend the fences, eventually Frances readjusts her career orbit and it turns out pretty well for her! The film has its unique lustre which feels like a quintessential Woody Allen picture (particularly MANHATTAN 1979, 7/10 in mind), dialog-ridden, non-sentimental coolness, and brilliant use of classical pieces to enliven the atmosphere. Gerwig gives a very lively impersonation of a not-so-likable character, and viscerally brings Frances' not-so-tactful life-philosophy up to life, she is far from a perfect human being, but Gerwig's intuitive momentum pierces through all the bells and whistles, sculptures Frances as an arresting personage with fresh and blood. Mickey Sumner, who plays Sophie, is less heralded, but she strikes up an assured front oscillating between frank and vague, she is the normal kind among us who is perpetually calculating, striving and puzzling whereas Frances is a less commoner dreamer, a spontaneous Pollyanna who wants to become a spinster together with her bestie, in a more realistic world, her weaned-off ritual must undergo through a hard way, but here Baumbach manifests his mercy to offer her an easy way out, thus, the aftertaste may differ from audience, nevertheless, it is a candid film doesn't pander to a larger demographic appeal, instead, the film tries its best to leave out an authentic character on the screen with a piquant personal spin.",Frances Ha
12,Hellmant,Like a Woody Allen movie except younger and much hipper!,9,7 November 2013,"'FRANCES HA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another quirky comedy-drama film from filmmaker Noah Baumbach about another social outcast trying to find themself. Baumbach previously has written (or co-written) and directed such critical darlings as 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE', 'GREENBERG' and 'MARGOT AT THE WEDDING'. He's also teamed with fellow quirky filmmaker Wes Anderson in writing movies like 'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' and 'FANTASTIC MR. FOX'. I enjoy all his films to varying degrees; I really like 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' and everything Anderson does but found 'GREENBERG' and 'MARGOT AT THE WEDDING' to be both amusing and annoying. That's the way I felt about his newest film as well. He directed and co-wrote it with actress Greta Gerwig (who also stars in the film and co-starred in 'GREENBERG'). It tells the story of a 27-year-old woman living in New York, who's on the outs with her best friend, as she tries to follow her dreams of being a dancer, while drifting from apartment to apartment and staying with friends. The film is shot in black-and-white and I really liked the style of it but also found it to be just a little too slow and uneventful.Gerwig plays Frances Haliday, a woman living in New York who's trying to become a dancer, while working as an apprentice for a dance company, even though she can't really dance. Her best friend, and longtime roommate, Sophie (Mickey Sumner) just moved out of their apartment to live with her new boyfriend Patch (Patrick Heusinger), leaving Frances homeless. Frances moves in with two guys she meets, Lev and Benji (Adam Driver and Michael Zegen), and stays on their couch while she can't afford full rent. She continues to follow her dreams of becoming a dancer, unsuccessfully, while resenting Sophie for moving on with her life and distancing herself from Frances. It seems like Baumbach was trying to channel Woody Allen, with his directing and storytelling style, and the film does seem like an Allen movie except younger and much hipper. The soundtrack is great (including multiple uses of the David Bowie song 'Modern Love', one of my all time favorite tunes) and the cast is all more than adequate but I don't think the characters are especially likable in any way. I have mixed feelings about Gerwig (as an actress and the characters she always seems to play). She's always so peculiar and offbeat (which is fine) but often to an annoying extent. That's the way her character is in this film. I pride myself on being different (and a social outcast), and like and respect others who are as well, but I don't find the characters Gerwig plays to be that relatable or likable despite all their quirkiness (or many in other Baumbach films as well, like Ben Stiller in 'GREENBERG'). Her character in this, and all the other characters in the film, are also somewhat self centered (at least to an annoyingly mild extent) and worried too much about superficial things. Still the movie is well made and Gerwig is sweet and endearing enough that you still have to root for her, even with all of her flaws. It's like your average Baumbach movie; not as good as most Wes Anderson' films but unique and different enough to make it worthwhile and memorable.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGndm52qI4",Frances Ha
13,Buddy-51,A perceptive comic look at youth in the city,8,16 January 2014,"Noah Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" has the freeform charm and exuberance of all those independent American and European films from the late 1950s and '60s about unfettered youth finding their way in the world. The comparison is made most striking by the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography that Sam Levy has provided for the film.Caught in that awkward period where one has not completely shrugged off the dependency of childhood yet not quite attained the full independence of adulthood, Frances is a 27-year-old dancer who's just a little too gangly, a little too relationship-phobic and a little too broke to feel truly secure about herself and her future. She and her best friend, Sophie, a publisher for Random House, are so close that they frequently refer to themselves jokingly as a single person and as a lesbian couple who never has sex. They share an apartment in Brooklyn - that is until Sophie moves in with another friend in another part of town, leaving Frances to secure lodgings with two fellows, Lev and Benji. There's a touch of ""Jules and Jim"" in the relationship between Frances and the men, a bit of ""Georgy Girl"" in Frances' bouts with insecurity and high-spirited kookiness. And it all feels vaguely Bohemian (Lev is a sculptor and rides motorcycles and Benji is a TV comedy writer) as any tale of young folk living in New York certainly should.Nothing quite turns out the way Frances wants them to, not her career moves, not her relationships; even an impromptu trip to The City of Lights turns out to be a dud. Rather than admit to little and not-so-little defeats in her life, Francis spins a web of fibs designed to convince others that she's doing just fine, thank you very much. But the defining feature of Frances' life is the growing jealousy she feels towards Sophie's fiancé who seems to be taking her best buddy and emotional ""life partner"" away from her.Yet, all this makes ""Frances Ha"" sound like some heavy-breathing tragedy, when nothing indeed could be further from the truth. It is, in fact, a delightfully droll and fetching comedy that doesn't over-rely on quirkiness as so many low budget independent comedies are wont to do. As written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, the screenplay finds a beautiful balance between poignancy and humor, highbrow wit and lowbrow farce. And as Frances, Gerwig brings to life one of the most purely appealing characters we've come across in quite some time, a flighty free-spirit whose self-consciousness and keen powers of observation keep her at least partially grounded in reality. She's matched in performance by Mickey Sumner as Sophie, Adam Driver as Lev and Michael Zegen as Benji.Together they and Baumbach have made a film that, though it may look like an art house oddity at first glance, has enough broad appeal to pull it into the mainstream.",Frances Ha
14,paul2001sw-1,A film for Frances,6,13 June 2021,"With it's dreamy aestheric, black-and-white photography, and New York Setting, Noah Baumbach's 'Frances Ha' at first feels like it's going to play out as a 'Manhattan' for the hispter era. But it soon turns darker, a tale of a late-twenty something finding her life fading to nothing as everyone she knows moves on and she is left behind. But it's intended poignancy failed to connect with me. The dream world Frances is losing is just too idealised, a privileged fantasy; yet at the same time, the idea that the beautiful Greta Gerwig (who co-wrote the script) would be ""undateable"" is wildly implausible, and Frances displays a form of Hollywood kookiness throughout that is supposed to make us fall in love with her but actually just wanted to make me scream at her to just grow up. It's a film that is one part fairytale, and one part story of an every-woman, and the two elements just don't mix, as if you took 'Amelie' and tried to inject random elements of social realism while remaining detached from any genuine awareness of what society is actually like. Ultimately, it feels like a movie made by people like Frances, for people like Frances; but not a movie for me.",Frances Ha
15,MOscarbradley,An Annie Hall for the 21st Century,9,25 August 2013,"""Frances Ha"" is Noah Baumbach's, and presumably Greta Gerwig's, since she co-wrote the script with real-life partner Baumbach, homage to the French New Wave and the cinema of Woody Allen﻿ just as Gerwig's Frances is an ANNIE HALL for the 21st century, even if she is sans her Alvy. She may not be the kind of girl you may want to spend too much time with in reality but on screen she is a monochrome delight, a kooky heroine with a pedigree that goes all the way back to Jean Arthur and Carole Lombard. Of course, Frances Ha isn't her whole name but less than half of it, (the title is explained in the final frame), though if a simple Ha were her surname it would suit Gerwig perfectly. Her dizzy character is never off the screen and while she can be a pain in the ass at times she finally wins you over and is one screen character you could happily spend a lot more time with. That's all down to Gerwig, recently described as 'the Meryl Streep of mumblecore', superb here and growing better with every role. It's also a movie that confirms Baumbach's status as one of the most likable and innovative young directors currently working in America and as a team I suspect he and Gerwig could be the Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon of contemporary New York. This is a lovely movie that sent me out of the cinema with the soppiest of grins on my face.",Frances Ha
16,gbill-74877,A cross between Girls and French New Wave,8,30 December 2018,"This felt a little like a cross between the TV series Girls and a French New Wave film, updated for this generation. Its strength is in showing the bad decisions and social awkwardness of its main character (Greta Gerwig) in shameless ways, and though it teeters at times just along the edge of being vapid, it remains interesting throughout. There are several funny moments and some interesting themes explored here: 'becoming a responsible adult', differences in class, trying to find one's path, and friends drifting in different directions after college. What a sweet moment it is when Gerwig catches the eye of her friend (Mickey Sumner) after what she's said earlier about she wants out of someone she loves. I also loved the bit with her name not quite fitting into the postal box window, a nice touch that seems to capture non-conformity, how things aren't always perfect, and that we carry on as best we can.",Frances Ha
17,secondtake,"Shorn of the irrelevant, this is beautiful, touching, real",9,4 December 2013,"Frances Ha (2012)I liked this film in a kind of interested, warm way as it got going. Its black and white simplicity and its regular people both appeal on the most normal level. The more I watched, however, and the more I absorbed the brilliance of the performance by leading actress playing Frances (Greta Gerwig), I became entranced and stunned. This is a great film. A great independent film, without production pretensions, but held together perfectly within its means.This is worth making clear—the film makes a virtue of its simple approach. You'll never feel like it's technically compromised. The photography is a subtle, smart black and white. There's even one scene near the end where two people are talking in bed and they chose to use the very minimum of light, so you just barely see their faces. For a long deep conversation. Gorgeous, and effective.It's Gerwig who steals the movie, for sure. And she helped write the really sparkling, believable, clever but never too-clever script. It's brilliant stuff. Brilliant. She hits a note of fast transparency, a totally ""right"" dialog and delivery. Way harder than it seems.And the character she plays, Frances, is one of those lovable types where things don't go quite right even with all the best intentions. Most of us identify with that all too well. We have our better selves and we have the reality of where those good intentions have gotten us. And yet she perseveres. She puts up with strange but not unfriendly people around her in one apartment after another, and we get a glimpse of young New Yorkers with all their minor pretensions.

18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,7,11 November 2013,"Frances HaThe best thing about being apart of the Millennial Generation is that you can wear your Superman costume to work.And while the protagonist in this dramedy doesn't partake in her age groups theatrics, she has their mind set.When Frances' (Greta Gerwig) best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner) moves out, she is left to pay rent on her paltry dance salary.Unable to cover the cost, she rents the couch of two artists (Adam Driver, Michael Zegen). But again, she cannot afford it.Later, Frances bunks with a fellow dancer (Grace Gummer) and takes a trip to Paris.Meanwhile, Sophie has got engaged to an old flame (Michael Esper).Although it takes awhile to get adjusted to Frances' social awkwardness, and her irresponsible nature, eventually she - and the black and white cinematography - becomes endearingly sweet.Furthermore, sleeping on peoples' couches is only embarrassing when you bring someone home.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Frances Ha
19,Reno-Rangan,Watch it as you are and transform into Frances.,10,20 December 2013,"It was my personal favourite of the year. I just can't show how much I loved this movie but will try my best in this review to explain. It was just like the movie 'The Pursuit of Happiness' where it describes a person's struggle over professional as well the relationship with a best friend. I don't know why this movie was in black and white but very seductive, like women from Charles Chaplin movies. The expressions are 'the killer' if you are a man who fall easily for struggling women. 'Ruby Sparks' is my one of the year's favourite which was written by the lead female of the movie and the same goes to 'Celeste and Jesse Forever'. I know it is out of topic but I was saying the lead actress from this movie who played Frances wrote this. All these were women oriented subjects which rendered the movies from a distinct angle.Frances is a cute and sarcastic woman in her late 20s lives with a best friend Sophie in New York city. She is not talented but as a professional dancer she earns enough to lead a happy life. Once she and her boyfriend breakup, Sophie too throws an another bomb as she decides to move out to live with her boyfriend. One after another her battle to survive in the city for rich remains hopeless. But pursue for her dream never ends as she wanted to be a fine choreographer. For all these she must hold back her downs of her life and aim only up to self discover the meaning of the life. Did she successful or not is what the movie steadily chronicles her efforts.The character Frances will be remembered for a long time, especially by me. I just did not only had a fondness on that character but it completely transformed me as one. In fact I felt the movie deeply into me that I regretted for unable to give my support to Frances. I came to know I am in love with Frances in the scene where she runs on the streets of Chinatown. I think it is the best scene of the movie, very adorable. You must watch the movie till the last frame before the end credits roll up to know the meaning of this strange title. It was a silly reason to have names like this for a movie but completely cool and refreshing. It is not a thought provoking or an art movie but believe me it is definitely a must see movie of the year.",Frances Ha
20,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,4 June 2020,"""Frances Ha"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch Frances a young woman who lives in New York even though she does not have an apartment and she wants to become a professional dancer even though she does not have the skills. She also has a lot of dreams but she does not have neither money nor a way not only to accomplish them but also pursue them.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed by it. The direction which was made by Noah Baumbach who is also one of the writers (the other writer is also the protagonist) was below average since he did not present very well the character of the protagonist and the way she lives. Finally, I have to say that ""Frances Ha"" is another average movie that wanted to be pretentious but failed therefor I do not recommend it to anyone because you will waste your time if you choose to watch it.",Frances Ha
21,eddie_baggins,An nice tale with a seriously frustrating central character,6,5 March 2014,"Crafting his most Woody Allen lite film yet, Allen's seemingly heir apparent Noah Baumbach's black and white New York set tale of modern day women and questionable life choices was a critical darling upon release and a film many would rank as one of their personal favourites of last year. Now for this to occur for yourself you will need to fall in love with Baumbach's and Gerwig's creation of Frances for if you don't (like I did) the films impact will be nothing more than slight enjoyment.Nothing is wrong with a character that makes bad choice after bad choice or who seems more concerned with going to a party than getting a decent job but in the case of our carefree Frances it just seems a little much. It could be the case that Baumbach's film is more accurate than we would care to admit when concerning oneself with the youth of today but it doesn't make the film anymore impactful. Gerwig is without doubt a fantastic Frances and it would be fair to say that this is her star making vehicle. It is due to her performance that Frances Ha succeeded in the way it did on release and was made tolerable despite our better judgements.As I am readily admitting that I did not find the character of Frances or any others in the film that wholly likable I am in agreeance with the critical and general public that Baumbach's film is filled with charm and acts as a love letter to the Big Apple that few films can capture. The black and white style fits in perfectly with the easy on the eye cinematography and the upbeat musical score and the film has a charm within that makes it truly hard to despise.For those that connect with Frances and her merry band of hipster friends Frances Ha will be a true joy and perhaps a new favourite to add to other New York set classics, for those like me who found the characters a little to slap worthy there is much still to enjoy in this tale of modern day love, friendship and life.On a side note to the film lets hope that Frances Ha star and Girls regular Adam Driver can pull off being a Star Wars villain if rumours of his casting are to be believed.3 spare of the moment Paris trips out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Frances Ha
22,Red-125,Self-indulgent film about a self-indulgent person,6,7 December 2014,"Frances Ha (2012) was co-written and directed by Noah Baumbach. It was also co-written by Greta Gerwig, who plays Frances. Gerwig and director Baumbach are romantic partners. This combination of director and star as lovers can work, or it can not work. In this movie it doesn't work. Frances is everywhere in the movie--she's not just the star, but she's the only person about whom we can care. (Or, as it turns out, not care.) The movie is a sort of love story between Frances and her best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner). The problem is that both women are straight, so the best they can do is talk, not talk, talk, not talk.Frances is supposed to be a dancer, but she doesn't look like a dancer, walk like a dancer, or act like a dancer. For that matter, we never really see her dancing. What she is supposed to be is charming, which she isn't. She's another character in another film about bright, privileged urban women who assume that after they graduate from college, something great will come along. Except, they don't really work to make that something great happen, and it doesn't come along. Baumbach is a good director, and Gerwig may be a good actor, but Frances isn't a good character, and so the whole package doesn't come together. If you're determined to see this film, it will work as well on DVD as it will on the large screen.",Frances Ha
23,leonblackwood,A joy to watch! 7/10,7,19 July 2014,"Review: I thought that this was a very well written movie with great acting by the small cast. Although the movie hasn't got any major stars and its all filmed in black and white, there is enough wit and drama throughout the film which keeps it interesting and a joy to watch. The main character whose played by Greta Gerwig, has a wicked sense of humour and she isn't scared to take on any obstacle that she comes across. She can adapt to any situation, even if she's making a fool of herself, and she has a kind heart, especially towards her best friend who is the more practical one of the two. Anyway, for a movie that is basically only about one character, it's directed well and all of the great performances added to this very original project which will definitely make you laugh. Joyful!Round-Up: Greta Gerwig, who had starred in movies like No Strings Attached and the awful remake of Arthur, was brilliant as Frances. She had a way of making the role seem so real and her no fuss approach to life really worked in the movie. The fact that she followed her dream, against all odds, gave some depth to the film and the whole situation with her best friend is one that we all can associate with. The movie didn't make a whole lot of money due to a small distribution budget, but it's much better than some of the movies that have the big studios behind them.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $8millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there witty dramas which follows a girl through a difficult time in her life. 7/10",Frances Ha
24,howard.schumann,"Though Frances may be undateable, the film is unmissable",9,23 June 2013,"Being called ""undateable"" is sort of like a team player being labeled ""uncoachable,"" not a strong recommendation. This label tags maturity-challenged Frances (Greta Gerwig) in Noah Baumbach's warm-hearted comedy Frances Ha, a film that has genuine affection for its characters. Co-written by Baumbach and Gerwig and supported by an eclectic soundtrack that includes music by French film composer Georges Delerue and the songs of David Bowie, Frances Ha (the title is explained in the film's final shot) is a film in which people talk and act like real human beings, not cardboard caricatures manipulated by a self-conscious script that ""strives for reality."" Though the film is full of light-hearted energy, it does not strain to be quirky or ""in your face."" It is clever because that's the way it is.Shot in black and white by cinematographer Sam Levy, 27-year-old Frances lives in a Brooklyn apartment with her girl friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner). She wants to be a dancer, and apprentices for a small dance company, but seems to lack the determination to really develop her talent. Though the exact nature of their relationship is not spelled out (what you see is what you get), they are at the very least good buddies who are tight. Frances says her relationship with Sophie is ""like a lesbian couple that doesn't have sex anymore,"" but Sophie is not quite as attached and tells Frances that she has decided to move in with her upscale boyfriend Patch (Patrick Heusinger).Refreshingly however, the story is not about relationships being the necessary ingredient of a woman's self-esteem, but simply one component of an internal growth process. Frances goes out with Lev (Adam Driver), another under-achieving New Yorker, but her economic needs trump her physical ones and she moves in with Lev and his roommate Benji (Michael Zegen) on a strictly platonic basis to save on the rent, although Benji develops a real connection with her (which Frances is blind to). She stumbles through relationships, not making a terrific impression. One woman tells her in talking about her friend, ""You look a lot older, but you seem far less mature."" Frances does not have the kind of job prospects that she alludes to with her friends and her overall veracity is questionable, but she makes up for it with tons of charm. She actually makes some stabs at shaking things up, going home to Sacramento to visit her parents (Gordon and Christine Gerwig, her real parents), impulsively flying to Paris for a weekend to prove to a friend that she can, and, upon returning after a joyless weekend, taking a job as a ""drink pourer"" at Vassar where she had gone to school. Unfortunately, the more things change, the more they stay the same.Although Frances Ha is about young New Yorkers living on the margins, it is not and does not aspire to be a commentary on the current economic situation or the plight of young people. The film is about talented folks who have not quite gotten it together and whose level of responsibility lags somewhere below the norm. The characters have their flaws and are not always self aware, but Baumbach recognizes that the process of growth does not happen suddenly and refuses to judge his characters, or make snide commentaries about New Yorkers.Frances Ha does not rely on formula or relationship clichés to make its points, but only on the performances to bring the characters to life. Baumbach and Gerwig take us on a wild ride without any clear signposts, yet the trip is poignant and even beautiful and we can joyously sense the light around the next turn. Unlike the angry, unpleasant Roger in Baumbach's previous film Greenberg, the more you hang around Frances (Greta Gerwig), the more you grow to like her insanely. Though Frances may be undateable, the film is unmissable.",Frances Ha
25,l_rawjalaurence,Slice-of-Life Portrayal of a Young Woman's Dreams That Lacks Depth,6,18 April 2014,"FRANCES HA has a straightforward plot: our eponymous hero (Greta Gerwig) aspires to become a dancer yet finds herself perpetually thwarted by circumstances. Unable to find a steady boyfriend, she takes pleasure in sustaining a platonic friendship with Sophie (Mickey Sumner), who fails to reciprocate, despite numerous protestations of love. Frances drifts through life, taking a succession of dead-end jobs and living with different people (she even returns to her parents in California), until she is given the opportunity to choreograph a dance of her own, through which she discovers fulfillment at last. Shot on a shoestring in black- and-white, Noah Baumbach's film has a free-wheeling spirit reminiscent of mid-1960s British films: despite her reversals, Frances sustains her basic optimism as she roams the streets of New York. Her joie-de-vivre contrasts with Sophie's more mundane existence - although more successful in career terms, Sophie ends up in a relationship with Patch (Patrick Heusinger) that condemns her to a life of disappointment. The only problem with FRANCES HA is that it ends up being slightly manipulative: Baumbach piles on Frances' agonies (even sending her to Paris for a disastrous weekend) without exploring her character in any great depth. We know little about her, other than the fact that she is determined to sustain her dreams at any cost. As a result, the feelgood ending seems a little artificial: we have little or no idea what Frances will do in the future. Perhaps it doesn't matter, as she likes to live for the moment rather than making any consciously long-term plans.",Frances Ha
26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Baumbach course-corrects with the raw and authentic 'Frances Ha',8,30 November 2013,"Tales of 20-somethings in New York City epitomize the independent film scene, as does the star and co-writer of ""Frances Ha,"" Greta Gerwig, the indisputable indie queen. Together with writer and director Noah Baumbach, ""Frances"" is practically the comfort food of independent film, a genre label usually reserved for something edgy and different. However, despite the film residing in the wheelhouse of its talent, it somehow finds a certain freshness and quirky sense of inspiration that you typically don't get from veterans.Re-teaming after the slightly more Hollywood-ized ""what am I doing with my life?"" film in 2010's ""Greenberg,"" Gerwig and Baumbach have taken a step back into something a little more on-the-sleeve. ""Frances Ha"" hides behind nothing — it is pure, unadulterated relationship-based emotion featuring entirely unremarkable characters meant to reflect the utter mundaneness and raw beauty that is the life of a struggling middle class person.Frances is a lover. She aspires to dance professionally despite the obvious limitations of her talent, and she has a powerful bond with her friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner). Their friendship, which transcends most on-screen friendships in terms of closeness and authenticity, is the core love story of the film. As much as Frances attempts to navigate new roommates and friendships, nothing can replace the connection between her and Sophie, two people who just get each other. The quote of the film comes from Frances describing when you know ""that's your person.""Perhaps the mere fact that ""Frances"" is a good love story that doesn't center on a non- platonic heterosexual relationship is what elevates it, but Baumbach makes some sound choices behind the camera too. Filming in black and white these days almost always comes off as a bit bold if not pretentious, but it works especially well in a number of scenes that employ classical music or classic film music from French composer Georges Delerue, adding foreign art-house and nostalgic tones to remind us that while the story feels modern, its core is timeless.""Frances"" is put together in sequences. The camera becomes a removed observer for quick snippets of scenes throughout, letting us see how Frances interacts with the world though we know what's going on inside; we have a sense of how she feels. All of these sequences are tied together by a song or musical style and have a clear beginning, middle and end, and the many sequences in the film are strung together with large chunks of time missing in between. There's no traditional plot, just a few key dramatic moments here and there involving Frances' career and relationships that shape and inform the rest of the film. At times, this can get extremely boring, but there are enough momentary gems throughout to keep the feeling of boredom from overpowering the other sentiments.Frances' dance career isn't the most interesting storyline in the film, but it's so relatable anyway. You always see hard-working, talented dancers in films, not average dancers who deeply care about dancing. It's clear that dance is what Frances loves, but she struggles, unable to make the company with which she apprentices. Yet she commits to doing it her way, and despite her ever-changing living situation and Sofie coming in and out of her life, she remains locked on her focal point, like a dancer doing a pirouette. Gerwig just owns these kinds of performances. She creates incredible nuance and mannerisms for her characters to make them quirky but totally believable. A scene in which she leaves dinner with her newfound friend Lev (Adam Driver) to run around looking for an ATM is over-the-top but kind of endearing. You never question Gerwig's authenticity, and the script steers so far away from anything resembling melodrama that Frances is never pushed into the kind of larger-than-life situation that requires an actor to really really work in order to bring a film down to earth, not that Gerwig would be incapable. The couple of freakouts Frances does have are weird, but totally natural.Fans of Baumbach's debut, ""Kicking and Screaming,"" will see ""Frances Ha"" as a return to form for the filmmaker, if for no other reason than the age of the characters, though ""Frances"" proves how much he has matured in writing witty dialogue that actually feels authentic. The big key difference between ""Frances"" and Baumbach's other work, however, is the choice to focus on a central character and not an ensemble film in which we have to feel connected to what's going on with every character. His style seems best suited for these kinds of character studies.Although one might be tempted to describe ""Frances Ha"" as ""the latest indie movie starring Greta Gerwig,"" it's more than just a drop in the films about 20-somethings bucket.~Steven CThanks for reading!

28,Turfseer,French New Wave tribute scores visually but its one-note protagonist and situations are less compelling,5,12 June 2013,"Noah Baumbach co-wrote 'Frances Ha' with his current significant other, Greta Gerwig, the actress who plays the title role. It's Baumbach's take on a 27 year old aspiring dancer/choreographer who just can't seem to get herself together. Slate Magazine's Dane Stevens describes Frances as ""childlike and disorganized."" Stephen Holden of The Times has an even more prescient descriptor, describing Frances as one who operates under a sense of ""entitlement."" The film is shot in black and white and it reminds me of the 1962 French New Wave flick, 'Cleo from 5 to 7'. While 'Frances' is not filmed in real time like 'Cleo', it has the same feel: expansive shots of the care-free, largely self-absorbed protagonist, who prances about, highlighted by one urban backdrop after another. Baumbach clearly wants us to link his film to the spirit of the French New Wave, as he employs the famed French film composer, Georges Delerue, to provide much of the film's soundtrack.When we first meet Frances, she's living in a Brooklyn apartment with her best friend, Sophie, who recites 'The Story of Us'—a whimsical tale of the two young women engaging in a ""world takeover"". However, as we break into Act II, Frances feels betrayed, when Sophie announces she's moving to a new apartment share which Frances can't possibly afford (Frances is an intern at a small dance company).Frances briefly resides with two younger guys, one of whom classifies her as ""undateable"". Frances often drinks too much and makes inappropriate comments in various social situations. Frances eventually travels to Sacramento to visit her parents and later, takes a particularly ill-advised trip to Paris, funded by a credit-card. All of this proves quite repetitious as Dana Stevens remarks in Slate: ""There are too many scenes in a row that make the same point—Frances is a creative but lovable flake who's her own worst enemy."" Just like in Cleo from 5 to 7, the protagonist's journey is not as important as allowing the viewer to take in the wonderful ambiance and atmosphere. Baumbach indeed is a virtuoso when it comes to highlighting Frances' myopia through visual (non-dialogue) scenes.Frances finally ends up as an RA at summer dance camp at Vassar College where she runs into now-married Sophie, who's flown in with her straight-arrow husband, who's now working in Japan. Sophie hates being in Japan and is unhappy in her marriage. Perhaps here Baumbach is foreshadowing Frances' eventual triumph: the struggling artist trumps those who opt for more traditional pathways (while Sophie seemingly is Frances' social better, Baumbach makes it clear, that's not the way it ends up).I can't help bring 'Cleo from 5 to 7' up again. Just like Frances, 'Cleo' goes from complete self-absorption to liberation. In Cleo's case, a sweet-talking soldier and an oncologists' positive diagnosis, bring her back to reality and happiness. In Frances' case, it's not really clear what got her to change her attitude after all the self-defeating, myopic behavior. By accepting the job at the dance company and then establishing her own clientèle of students (creating her own dance school), Frances suddenly finds redemption.'Frances Ha' has some sharp performances, particularly Ms. Gerwig in the title role along with Mickey Sumner as Sophie. Mr. Baumbach's visual style and direction is a worthy throwback to the French New Wave era. Nonetheless, some may find the non-conformist Frances' machinations to be too one-note and grating throughout most of the film. Baumbach is more forgiving and suggests that Frances' late maturity is normal and part and parcel of normal young adult development.",Frances Ha
29,meeza,Greta G. is on her way to thespian greatness!!!,8,28 December 2013,"There are not too many ""ha ha ha's"" in the indie film ""Frances Ha"" but to be frankly Frances with you, it did not need them. Noah Baumbach, who is an iconic independent filmmaker, has made another solid dialogue- oriented character flick in ""Frances Ha"". In this one, it is all centered in the quirky universe of its title character. Frances is an apprentice in a modern dance company. She does not really have a settled habitat, as she roams from apartment to apartment in New York City. She is very idiosyncratic in her mannerisms, vocabulary, and impulses. She is obsessed with her best friend Sophie; I guess it is Sophie's choice if the feeling is mutual. The Frances character is in every scene of the movie, and fills the screen with character. This could not have happened if it wasn't because of the unfathomable starring performance from Greta Gerwig as Frances. The scene where Frances is jovially running through the New York side-streets to David Bowie's classic ""Modern Love"" is undoubtedly one of the best cinematic scenes of 2013. Baumbach shot the film in ""black and white"" in the style of the legendary late director Francois Truffaut; in fact, most of the picture was a homage to classic avant-garde Truffaut cinema. Baumbach and Gerwig also scribed a withy screenplay, which did not stand out but was in synch for the Frances character. None of the supporting performances were worth noting, probably due to the fact that this was Frances' show. There is no profound ""Ha you like me now?"" scene to ""Frances Ha"" but its still a worthy little picture that you should run to; as Frances would in ""Modern Love"". **** Good",Frances Ha
30,pixrox1,A contender for the silliest title of the year . . .,7,3 July 2013,". . . as this movie ends with its title character, Frances Halliday (played by Greta Gerwig) affixing the small name card into the appropriate slot on the mail box for the apartment to which she just has moved. Since the slot is fairly small, and her name is writ fairly large, she decides to fold her name over to shorten it (rather than writing or typing it in a smaller font, like a normal person would). To make matters worse, instead of executing a double fold so that her box is denoted as ""F. Halliday,"" she shortens her surname to ""Ha,"" which makes her masquerade as a person of Asian heritage, not to mention create a source of future confusion for her neighbors, and especially her mail people. Maybe this good was intentional on the part of the filmmakers, to summarize just how much of an airhead Frances is, for the dolts who did not pick up on her ditziness in the first 85 minutes, 40 seconds of this 85:44.64-long flick.

31,estebangonzalez10,Greta Gerwig charms and dances her way through Frances Ha,8,16 December 2014,"""I'm so embarrassed. I'm not a real person yet.""I found Frances Ha completely irritating and the black and white cinematography pretentious, but that was only for the first five minutes of the film because once I was submerged into the world of this character I was captivated by it. I don't think I have experienced a change of heart so quick while I was watching a film as I did here because soon I was in love with this character. Greta Gerwig's performance as Frances Ha went from irritating and phony to charming and sweet in a matter of a few minutes. The black and white cinematography had the feel of a French New Wave art-house film, but to my surprise it ended up being much more than an imitation or a simple homage. Noah Baumbach is aware with the fact that many people have trouble identifying with these quirky NY East Side characters and he deviates the plot from what we are expecting it to be very quickly. If this year Richard Linklater delivered the ultimate slice of life film on the transition from boyhood to teenager, then Frances Ha could be considered as Baumbach's slice of life film about adulthood and finding a place in this world. It isn't a perfect film, but it does explore the issues of self-discovery and learning who we are in life. Frances Ha is a very subjective film considering its enjoyment may be connected with how much you identify with Frances's situation. All her friends are moving on with their lives and she seems to be stuck in the same place dealing with the uncertainty of her life. Her friends seem to have their lives resolved, but she doesn't know what direction she is heading. Audiences who have experienced or are experiencing this same uncertainty might find it easier to relate with the film and enjoy it more for capturing the truth of their lives in some way. I connected with the film and wouldn't mind rewatching it again, but I can see how it isn't a film everyone will enjoy. Greta Gerwig delivers a solid performance and gives this nostalgic film an upbeat feel to it. She drew me in with her uplifting performance and I found it impossible to resist her charm despite her flaws. She balances the charm with the quirkiness of her character. You can hate her for being so possessive, but at the same time you can fall for her optimism and contagious joy. You forgive her for the bad decisions she makes and route for her nonetheless. This is Gerwig's best performance to date. She had already caught my attention in Baumbach's earlier film, Greenberg, playing opposite Ben Stiller, but this is a much better film. Despite enjoying The Squid and The Whale and Greenberg quite a bit, this is Baumbach's best film. It may have to do with the fact that Gerwig herself contributed with the screenplay and that she is in every single scene of this movie. This is absolutely her movie and she delivers. Mickey Sumner, Adam Driver, and Michael Zegen give solid performances as well as they all interact in some way with Frances, but she is the heart and soul of this film. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of this film and there is a scene where Frances is walking through the streets of New York with David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" playing the background which will leave a smile on the audiences's faces.",Frances Ha
32,3xHCCH,Open to Anybody's Interpretation,4,2 January 2014,"I do not really understand all the love for this film, which is like a stream-of-consciousness telling of the mundane events in the life of a 27-year-old flighty bachelorette in New York City, named Frances. You will only understand the title at the very last frame of the film, if you are patient enough to stay and reach that part.In essence the story goes like this: Frances has a best friend Sophie, but one day they come in conflict with each other and part ways. Later, they find their way back to each other again. In between, we see Frances and her male roommates, Frances ruminating about being ""un- dateable"", Frances and her being a dancer, and so on.

I didn't dislike this movie, but it is full of all the moments that make up your typical indie art film. If you usually find them pretentious, that's probably how you'll see Frances Ha. I guess the idea is that the movie is more of a series of moments than a linear narrative. I didn't feel that it had the typical storytelling arc for the character to follow. I also didn't understand what we were supposed to think about the many odd choices the main character makes. She lies needlessly, makes some impulsive decisions, fails to take risks on other occasions, and just generally doesn't seem to have any consistent motivation throughout. You could say that the point is that she is a case of arrested development and hasn't figured out how to be an adult at a time when things should be falling into place in her life, but it starts and ends with her in pretty much the same place and doesn't add up to anything other than 90 minutes of a mildly interesting look into this character's life.

This is a film whose preview wasn't sending the right signals, so I was going to wait for its video release, but lucky for me I caught it in a movie theater and enjoyed every bit of it, from its gorgeous photography to its impeccable screenplay and affecting performances.Recalling the best of ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"", the film takes a thought provoking look at the life of a single girl in New York. We are witnesses to the simple moments that make her happy, her disappointments, hopes, impulsive decision making, and the ultimate satisfying conclusion, where we discover where the title of the movie comes from.Frances has dreams, isn't quite sure of how she will make them a reality. She has innocent hope and unbridled optimism; sometimes not considering any logical consequences or alternatives. Everyone seems to recognize this, truly enjoy her quirky personality but are not sure of how to handle her. It looks like they want the best for her, but they can't seem to gather enough courage to tell her what is not working.In one of the film's best scenes, she is ""studied"" by a dinner party who can't believe here is a human being with this much energy and/or naiveté. She also is incapable of hiding her emotions, and it's heartbreaking how an impulsive trip to Paris becomes the most devastating disappointment. Here she is in one of the most wonderful cities in the world, and her loneliness is heartbreaking.This film won't disappoint anyone with a heart who had dreams and hopes, who has seen friends come and go, who can't really hate anyone who means something to them. The film will delight and entertain you, as well as teach you a few things about life. It will show there is still hope for the future of independent movie making.",Frances Ha
36,dierregi,Vanity project of actress/director lovebirds and VIPs friends,1,26 August 2014,"Frances is an ""apprentice"" dancer - which is hard to believe since she is very ungainly. Apart from ""dancing"" she never worked a real job in her life. Frances shares an apartment with BFF Sophie, in a sort of a ""celibate"" lesbian relationship (at least, from Frances' side).Both girls have boyfriends, but Frances has no problem with dispassionately dumping hers, when he proposes she moves in with him. Unfortunately for Frances, Sophie actually moves in with her man, Patch. Frances, feeling hurt and betrayed (additional strong lesbian vibes) cannot pay rent and moves in with another couple of slackers. Then she gets ""temporarily"" sacked from the dance company she works for and ""sort of"" runs out of money.This does not stop her from flying to Paris for a weekend and from refusing a job as a ""mere"" accountant, which would not fulfill her artistic delusions. She meets with Sophie and Patch and comes to terms with them getting married. In the end, Frances accepts the ""normal"" job and moves into her own apartment, while maintaining her status as ""undateable"".Shot in black & white, by director Baunbach, the movie tries and fails miserably to look like a mix of French nouvelle vague (specifically Jules & Jim) and early Woody Allen (specifically Manhattan).Gerwig plays Frances as a lethargic young woman, lacking elegance and discipline, which presumably are needed for such a competitive and physical profession. Sophie is played by one of Sting's children and one of Streep's daughters plays another dancer, completing the cast of VIPs. Neither shines, but I guess being mediocre actresses will not hurt their careers.Baumbach and Gerwig were (still are? Really don't care) a couple during the filming. Actress/director relationships usually produce mediocre movies, and this is just another one to add to the list.",Frances Ha

38,jadepietro,New York State of Mindless,4,12 June 2013,"This film is not recommended.Who is Frances Ha? She's a free spirit, a Holly GoLightly wannabe without the haute couture. She's a dreamer, a pensive soul who enjoys life to the fullest, even though it continually puts up obstacles to impede her success. She's a bumbler, a Georgy Girl type without the accent, unable to achieve any goal but still searching for love and romance against the backdrop of today's city life. She's Greta Gerwig, an actress who continues to make unusual choices with her independent film roles. She underplays the title role and creates a totally believable character, even if the character is not well developed or that engaging.Noah Baumbach directed this dramedy and both he and Gerwig wrote the screenplay which seemed to rely too much on improvisational dialog and not enough on plot or character development. The film is more a character study that a coherent narrative with very little action happening throughout the film, except for Frances' spur-of-the-moment decision- making and her resulting travels. Frances Ha needs the moviegoer to truly care about the central character and her trials and tribulations in order to appreciation the film. I didn't care or like this woman. Her quirks and eccentricities far outnumbered her charm (though it's not the fault of the talented actress and more so its script. Frances' appeal simply eluded me and the other supporting roles were even sketchier characters.The biggest surprise for me was the positive critical reaction to this film. Some critics have even aligned (or maligned might be a better term) Woody Allen's far superior classic view of cosmopolitan life, Manhattan to this slight independent film. While both films take a comic approach in their romanticized New York City persona, only one remotely succeeds. (Perhaps the strong black & white photography by Sam Levy helped them to make that association with both films.) In comparison, I think that is a bit of a stretch, but Frances Ha lacks the strong creative vision and intricate plotting. Frances Ha is neither enough of a drama to build any emotional connection, nor is there enough humor to classify this film as a comedy, although one ha is about the right amount of laughs the film elicited from the audience. Frances Ha is earnest and sincere in its intention to please moviegoers, but it essentially is caught somewhere in the middle, in need of a substantial rewrite and a more involving heroine to actually root for.

39,framptonhollis,"noah baumbach becomes a much more cheerful man, and greta gerwig glows",9,23 February 2018,"So much fun, so funny, so moving and beautiful and real. ""Frances Ha"" has gotten a few less than favorable reviews from folks on this very site, but I must strongly object to said reviews. Personally, this is just my kind of movie I guess. It's mostly plotless, episodically following the main character, Frances, as she struggles to make money and keep friends in NYC. It's very much in that classic indie movie mold of ""oft-romantically-involved, witty, well educated twentysomethings living their daily lives with plenty of comedy and drama to go around,"" but there really is something about ""Frances Ha"" that makes it so much more special than the average film that fits this formula. Basically, one of the very best things your independent film can have is a performance by the lovely and talented Greta Gerwig, particularly as your film's leading lady, and especially when she's playing a character as compelling as this. She is super likable in every single scene she's in, but she still makes a boatload of face palming mistakes throughout the course of the film, while still being so lovable that you can't help but be on her side. She's just such a wonderful character, and is played with so much genuine honesty and accuracy by Gerwig (probably partially because Gerwig herself acts a lot like this in real life considering her overall mood during interviews and (more triumphantly recently) award speeches) that this movie becomes so much fun to ""hang out"" with, sort of like ""American Graffiti"" or ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or ""Dazed and Confused"" (as well as ""Slacker"" and The ""Before"" Trilogy) or even ""Boogie Nights"" to a certain extent; these are all movies I love, and I am so very grateful that a film like ""Frances Ha"" can now join such a list!",Frances Ha
40,jellopuke,Flighty character study,7,7 January 2018,"Simple story that focuses on a character and little vignettes in her life. A tad aimless, but with charm. Kind of like an afternoon tea in the sunshine... in movie form...",Frances Ha
41,bkrauser-81-311064,Very Personal,9,30 April 2016,"It was my birthday recently. Officially I'm in my late-20's; the point in one's life where career goals take precedence over impromptu road trips with friends. Where settling into a routine is a sign of maturity and love is no longer about romance and magic but about compatibility and ""the future"". Needless to say, I'm not where I should be (are any of us?). Life can sometimes feel like playing a game after it's already started and realizing most of the game- pieces have gone missing. Sometimes we just have to make due.Frances Ha is a kindhearted and bittersweet pat on the shoulder to those feeling the existential dread of growing up. When we first meet Frances (Gerwig) our free-spirited protagonist, she's hitting the New York City Subway with her best friend and roommate Sophie (Sumner). Sophie confirms Frances's fear that she'll be moving out and living with her fiancée Dan (Esper). That revelation, coupled with the dwindling hopes of making a coveted spot in her dance troop sends Frances into a tailspin. The film then gently drifts with Frances as she struggles to make the adjustments in her life she needs, while still shooting for the dreams that brought her this far.Frances Ha is not a cautionary tale about the folly of dreams, nor is it an obnoxiously twee endorsement of their tenacity. Instead the camera follows our beleaguered hero with kind eyes, hoping to gain insight through granular subjectivity. By all respects Frances is a hot mess, but she exhibits an intelligence and effervescence that overwhelms the audience's inclination to call her and the people around her self-absorbed. We don't know what will become of Frances and her dreams but we as the audience are invited into every detail of her sun-kissed world. Even when she takes a fruitless trip to Paris; a dalliance few millennials can afford, we still sympathize with her and want her to succeed.Both director Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig co-wrote the screenplay resulting in a film so nuanced and complex that it can't help but feel personal. The crisp black and white cinematography and elliptic montages sprinkled throughout evoke memories of the French New Wave yet the straightforward narrative aims for something more oblique than simply being a disruptive force. While Jules and Jim (1962) is brassy, Frances Ha is reticent; while Vivre Sa Vie (1962) is socio- political, Frances Ha is singular. Calling back to the visual aesthetics and style of the 60's, Baumbach and Gerwig successfully build a serene naturalistic world within the bustling monoliths of New York City. In Frances's own words ""It's like magic.""At twenty-seven years old, Frances craves the emotional, intellectual and spiritual maturity that everyone around her seems to have. She asks others, almost naively, who she is and who she might become. She never realizes that the same people she asks don't have answers for themselves yet. Friends Benji (Zegen) and Lev (Driver) act like wayward Bohemians despite their breeding. Yet despite their pretensions they exhibit the same fears and the same aspirations as Frances and Sophie do. And much like Frances and Sophie, they eventually adapt and change. Dan and Sophie's supposedly solid relationship serves as a coda to Frances character development. The point in which Frances truly commits to change. I won't ruin the resolution to the story but I will say that when Frances muses ""I like things that look like mistakes,"" you're still taken by her sunny disposition.Frances Ha may not impact you as much as it did me. The film entered my life around the same time the film itself enters Frances's. I feel her pain, I have experienced her disappointments and thanks to the film's stark beauty, I have shared in her small triumphs and sweetly clumsy bemusement. Frances Ha forced me to examine who I was and where I'm going; a feat few films have made me do. The film ends with our plucky hero writing her name on a label. A small detail that makes a bold, if gawky pronouncement: ""I am here."" It's an inspiring final tableau; one that makes me feel better about not having my life together in my late-twenties.",Frances Ha
42,Sergeant_Tibbs,Consistency mildly irritating.,6,16 November 2013,"A festival favourite last year, Frances Ha quickly earned a reputation for being Noah Baumbach's best yet and feeling like Wes Anderson plus Woody Allen. With those two filmmakers in mind, I couldn't have been more excited for it. I quite like Baumbach too, he's a welcome addition to the writing team with Wes Anderson's films, The Squid and The Whale is a great film and while Greenberg is only good, Greta Gerwig was a total highlight. He has an interesting quiet sense of drama that I can sometimes really connect to. However, Frances Ha was incredibly disappointing. Consistently mildly irritating is the phrase I'd use. It's far too in the middle, rarely approaching dramatic extremities. I didn't connect or empathise with Frances as she had very little at stake and little to do in general.It's a film that thinks its more clever than it is. I didn't laugh once. While the dry jokes may be funny on paper, the deliveries never clicked and it's too quirky for its own good. Unfortunately the acting and cinematography are just too amateuristic. It feels more like a student film than anything from a professional. Maybe it's the choppy editing that killed it most with strange montages that don't have a sense of time of place resulting in it feeling disorientating. But then, these aspect give it a naive impish charm much like the protagonist, however it's just too self-aware for me. The thing about Frances Ha is that it definitely comes from a very genuine place. This isn't forced twee and that stops it from being cringeworthy, but that doesn't work for everyone.I had to rewatch The Royal Tenenbaums straight after to make sure my sense of quirky humour was still in tact and in doing so, I realized what Frances Ha was lacking (as well as appreciating Tenenbaums more than ever). It lacks tragedy. What makes all Wes Anderson films work is the deep rooted emotion behind its quirkiness. Anderson puts them in this world with their behaviour as a way of dealing with, for example, a great loss. Frances has none of this. She just glides through life and it isn't endearing behaviour. Maybe if she had something, it would be a better film, but this film will only strike a chord with few. Even so, like Baumbach's other films, I'll admit it has a great soundtrack. I discovered some of my favourite songs from Greenberg and Squid, maybe I'll revisit this soundtrack too.6/10",Frances Ha

Not that it's no return, because Frances will certainly in five years have kids too.Greta Gerwig is great as expected.

44,napierslogs,Frances moves in annoying circles and the film has too little direction,5,11 August 2013,"At first glance, Noah Baumbach seems to have taken a cue from Woody Allen with his latest, ""Frances Ha"". It's in black and white, with a classical and jazz music score, and it stars his new actress muse. In fact, co-written by her. But then the movie starts and it becomes clear why no critics were comparing him to Allen. It just doesn't have the same feel or tone as a Woody Allen movie. I'll use the term ""immature"".Frances (Greta Gerwig) is 27 she's at that age where you're supposed to grow up, get a job, get a house and have your life-long friends established, but when her best friend moves out, Frances doesn't have any of that. What people like about Frances and the movie is that it doesn't stop her. She retains her optimism as she bounces from unclear life plan and unstable living arrangement. I was ready for her to grow up just a bit sooner.In her second apartment, Frances forms a connection with her cute roommate Benji (Michael Zegen), but she doesn't see what's right in front of her. She thinks she's getting a job as a dancer, but she must not realize that they're not opening up many new dance factories. She does realize when people are looking down on her for her directionless life and this sparks a change in her. She decides to start acting spontaneously. I think now is a good time for the audience to start questioning her intelligence.But we're supposed to like her plucky attitude, enthusiasm for an undefined future, her optimism for living in the moment. And for the most part we do. It's like Frances understands that we're laughing at her which means we're actually laughing with her, and that makes the comedy much more enjoyable. Gerwig also makes Frances more likable than she otherwise would be. When Frances falls down, Gerwig picks her up and she skips off to her next random stop in life.""Frances Ha"" is supposed to be a slice-of-life film for a girl suffering from a quarter-life crisis, but her life is so randomly put together, the film feels randomly put together.

It captures the confusion and struggles of navigating life in your 20s quite well, and even though that's not the great struggle a person can technically go through, I don't think that means a movie can't be made about it (if the execution or the characters are too irritating for some viewers, that I can understand, of course).It's nicely shot and fairly funny, and I love how quickly it moves, with usually only a couple of minutes or less spent on each scene (Gerwig did something similar when she made Ladybird, and it's a style I really like for movies that are more character than plot focused)I also like the cast, with Adam Driver shining in a fairly small role (as he always does) but Greta Gerwig's the one who really steals the show with a great lead performance. She's knocked it out of the park when it comes to directing with both Ladybird and Little Women now, but I hope she hasn't completely given up acting, because she has a great presence on screen and is overall a really fantastic and natural actress.",Frances Ha

The main character, Frances Hadley, is played by Greta Gerwig who co-wrote the screenplay with the film's director, Noah Baumbach.Baumbach does fine work as a director as most scenes are short and energetic. It is tempting at times to compare his style and subject matter (neurotic New Yorkers) with those of Woody Allen. He is well aided by a very good cast highlighted by Gerwig.Around the second half of the film, it's difficult to empathize. The main character gets lost in a series of lies and compulsive debting for the purpose of keeping up appearances and social climbing. Such a character would be interesting in a story as a supporting character - someone who could provide laughter and insight while displaying their obnoxious behaviour. But this doesn't bode well when it is the main character which takes potential away from what seemed like a promising film.

So her mailbox slot reduced her to Frances Ha. The film's structure is episodic, titled with each new geographical site she busts into then out of. She wants a home but flits from one free or subsidized friend's place to the next.She wants to be a dancer but can't quite get beyond apprentice. She has a flair for choreography but she has boxed herself into that dancing ambition. She's apparently heterosexual but is fixated on recovering her BGF relationship with Sophie (Mickey Sumner), who leaves their co-rental for a new roomie who has found an apartment on Sophie's favourite street and who then moves to Japan with her new fiancé. The film's last scene gives Frances and Sophie that sweeping intense feeling of tacit understanding that Frances blurted out at a dinner party was what she craved as love.So, all plot twists and character moans notwithstanding, the film has a happy ending. But Frances Ha is a disturbingly enigmatic figure. Like her name she's reduced. Why can't such a spirited, privileged beauty get a life? She has no tensions with her parents, whose coddling of their dog suggest how they treated her when she was that size. She comes from a secure, confident middle class -- our parents', that is, not the endangered species of USA today. Dan (Michael Esper) and Frances are close friends who insulate themselves against love by their recurrent tagline ""Undatable."" That humorous self-deprecation wards off any advance of their affection. With the characters' drifts, privilege, literacy, wisdom, spontaneous chatter, and their self-restrictive if not -destructive reflexes, this film chronicles another Lost Generation. It's a generation lost in irony. The incantation of ""undatable"" puts the couple's emotions into quotation marks. At first sign of feeling they step outside them for a knowing look and the label. Penniless but with a new credit card Frances splurges on a weekend in Paris just to use a new friend's flat. Ironically, she makes no connections there either but en route room gets an invitation to a party there where she would have met a new Jean Pierre Leaud type. This whole silly extravagance is another form of Frances's irony, as she makes huge moves solely on impulse. Burying yourself with your plastic is spending money ironically, spending it but not quite spending it because it's not there. Frances ends with a Ha about everything. The Ha can be resignation, despair, detachment, fear, as well as humour, acceptance, and dare I say hope? Irony, as we know from Kierkegaard's thesis, is not just a literary form but a way of living.

Frances Ha is an out of work dancer. This movie focuses on Frances relation with her best friend as it deteriorates from moving apart. Along Frances' journey she confronts her past and future as she discovers herself.Frances Ha is a well directed, well written, and well acted movie. At about 90 minutes of run time, this movies does not overstay its welcome. Scenes flow well and the audience can see the deterioration of Frances and Sophie's relation as the two drift apart. Viewers that are not interested in a slice of life story may find this movie dull. The director does an excellent job for the most part in conveying the feeling of each scene. It is only some scenes such as Frances' alumni party scene which is not as well directed.The writing and acting in this movie is top notch. The audience spends most of their time with Greta Gerwig as Frances and the performance is magnetic. Frances should be an unlikable protagonist. She is needy, impulsive, duplicitous, and unconfident. However, Greta Gerwig portrays the character so well that the audience can feel for the character's plight. Many people have been down on their luck; and comparing their own success to that of their friends. It is simply too easy to believe that others have it better than you do and it would damage your own image. As a viewer, Greta Gerwig is able to convince the audience to empathize with her character's plight. Even as the character does actions the audience does not agree with, the viewer can still understand why she did it. It is this attribute that endears the movie and its characters to the viewer.The basic plot of the movie is generic but the smaller details such as dialog are well done. The writer and director does a good job with creating believable and dialog that one can both enjoy and analyze.I would recommend Frances Ha. However, I recognize it is not a movie for everyone. It is a movie that requires the viewer to be in a certain mood and willing to watch a movie that does not have a payoff. This genre of movie is not a movie with an easy payout.

Here, I share my feelings about this film. My review goes like thisAn admirable film that relates to growing up, understanding relationships and more so seeking companionship.At 27, in America you are naturally expected to be with someone either in a physical relationship or dating or engaged. But, Frances Ha does not have any of those, she is seeking and trying to find if there is someone or hoping that may someone find her. Staying with her girlfriend 'Sophie' there is a world she has made of her own and tries to do something good for Sophie and herself always. Derived from the name of the character which is Frances Haliday and portrayed superbly by Greta Grewig who has brought life to the character. Greta Grewig plays it extremely convincingly and with complete control over very nuance and the subdued emotion of the character.Characters are etched out by actions and the actions are reflected by the dialog. The dialog is a sheer choice of words like we do in our daily lives. If someone asks something we have a plethora of words and emotions to pick from. The range varied from a sarcastic remark to an admirable sigh to a gesture of gratitude. Now this very choice makes us what we are and that indeed had made Frances Ha a very reliable character. It can be you too given that you are a girl or rather understand what is being girl all about.As I mentioned, dialog reveals character and in this motion picture it's the choice of words by Noah Baumbach and they turn into good dialog and making the film interesting and worthwhile. This is a film of a Woman of today that is 2012 and her own self identify crisis, self goals, financial coping up on standing by herself in making ends meet and all of that and more, even some psychological and physical aspects. All put together it is a completely contemporary movie. And I love it coz this about a girl of today, in the times I live.Interestingly, the film is in Black and White I have always loved the Black and White simply because they minimize the trappings of admiration, you cannot say, oh, that was lit of so well, the lights are wonderful, a great natural scene and all that, coz it's all devoid of colors and if leaves are not green, most would not bother if they are black or white. So that sets me as a viewer in focus and the focus primarily is on the emotions of the character. I love the black and white films and happy that even today a handful of directors are trying this.It's good in editing, indeed it was so quick that it got over in a whiz, it's wonderful in cinematography that made me feel claustrophobic when shot in the apartments and made me feel so clumsy in crowd and happy in the woods. The dialogs are smart witty and extremely reliable.Now, above all I loved the relationship of the two girls Sophie and Frances. They are like two thick friends who have some ego within them that develops, it can be considered envy to an extent but there are no hard feelings yet as they wish each other luck. So tough to put a name to it and it really made it interesting. The climax is not there and is like, life goes as in the Telugu film ""ANTHULENI KATHA"" where the protagonists life goes on, driven more by circumstances this film too has that and it makes it more realistic.This kind of cinema is becoming a rarity as we are moving into more commercial space where film is losing the purpose of art, it's more like how much money will I get with a venture than about, how many will like it. I am unhappy coz I had to watch this as a download and not in cinemas. Thanks to Criterion collection for making me aware of this gem.I am going with 4/5 for a film I loved. For the real film aficionados, this will be a well worth spent time.",Frances Ha

It's short and does a good job of unambiguously showing her character through actions. It's easy to sympathize with her struggles and simultaneously laugh and cringe at her nervous social interactions. Gerwig is really great in the role, showing how she forces herself to engage and keep talking to people while also feeling uncertain and lonely much of the time. The narrative arc (or whatever semblance of one there is) was so poorly set up as to border on contradictory. The second act of the movie was basically repeated good opportunities she's given (living in Sophie's apartment and working in the dance office being the two biggest ones) which she turns down out of some sense of self-sufficiency that truly makes no sense. Still, I was on board with those being irrational decisions caused by her illusory expectation that she is doing well, has a coherent plan, and has opportunities. Then we get the ending which unexpectedly turns into a happy ending where she achieves a dancing milestone and really does have things under control. She's certainly not a relatable character in her impulsive, social perception driven decisions like going to Paris for a weekend while barely being able to cover rent, but I liked her because Baumbach seemed to have a distinct vision of her which Gerwig brought to life wonderfully. The ending cast that more into doubt for me, but doesn't erase the well-written and funny character developments that came before it.",Frances Ha

Frances Ha has sharp direction and dialogue delivered profoundly by lead Greta Gerwig and one of the great ensembles of the year that includes the great Adam Driver and Mickey Sumner. The choice to present the film in black and white is not only tenderly appreciated but immensely gleaming. The editing, done by Jennifer Lame, is a tightly packed and intelligently executed; Lame showcases herself as a young Thelma Schoonmaker in the making. Gerwig's ""Frances,"" who is a blend of Alyson Hannigan's character from American Pie and an artistic hybrid of Ellen Page in Juno, is so lovable, even when she's making poor choices and wonderfully heartwarming. Gerwig is worthy to stand with any Lead Actress contenders for the Academy Awards. It's a tender and loving turn. It's always great to see someone love and dedicate themselves to a character the way Gerwig demonstrates. Supporting players Adam Driver, best known for his unlovable presence on HBO's ""Girls,"" lightens up and becomes someone tangible. Driver is a talent to watch. Mickey Sumner, reminiscent of Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson's role in Lost in Translation, is one of 2012's great finds. Her ""Sophie"" is an oxymoron of what is a great companion and a beautiful cinematic personality. You love ""Sophie,"" worry about her, long to be with her, though she seems unavailable and absent. That's credit to Sumner's turn. The star of the film is the screenplay by Baumbach and Gerwig, who both pen the best modern American comedy since Diablo Cody's Juno. There's integrity in what they're writing. They assemble this ""Frances"" from scratch, frame by frame, adding comedic beats that fit her and not just for the sake of a laugh. They respect the audience watching. Frances Ha is the best indie-comedy of the year. A true awards contender for screenplay and Greta Gerwig; if justice exists will include them among any nominees.

56,bbewnylorac,Solid movie,7,17 August 2013,"It's a pity that this film has been over-hyped as brilliant, because it isn't. It's a small, art-house film. But it is an honest, interesting study of one young woman's little triumphs and disappointments among the millions of souls in New York City. It shows how sometimes in life you're tossed about between friends, jobs and relationships with seemingly little control. What I liked was the fact that Frances was so flawed and human. She misses huge opportunities such as being too self absorbed when a guy likes her, and failing to recognise her boss offering her a great job. She goes to Paris and instead of the clichéd romantic good time, has a lousy time, because she fails to get in contact with a friend who lives there. She goes to a dinner party and most of the guests are pretentious and rude to her. She doesn't fit in, and everything she says comes out wrong. How many of us have been in that situation? It's not a film I'd see again, but it was quite pleasant.",Frances Ha
57,Dragonborn64,Sweet/ Familiar,7,23 June 2020,"Who puts their first name on a mailbox anyway? It's sad that Greta Gerwig has publically denounced Woody Allen because his influence is all over her work and by extension Baumbach - heavily. Frances Ha is a very likeable film in a genre where originality is very difficult. The eccentric, quirky square peg somehow finding her way through self made chaos. The acting is very rehearsed to seem totally natural & most often it succeeds. The movie could sort of be a sequel to Gerwig's Ladybird ( which is a much better movie). In short I liked the movie- been meaning to see it for years- but it's quite manipulative in that it's hard not to like such a character though even for the audience she can be trying - who in heck would take a sleeping pill when you have 2 days in Paris? That's just dumb. The spontaneous weekend trip to Paris- totally with it but the pill was like oh how silly can we make our Frances. That being said there are some truly comical moments as well.",Frances Ha
58,TaylorYee94,The power of ordinary story,8,24 April 2021,"No drama, no interesting storyline, no attractive protagonist.. 'Frances Ha' does not have all the requisite to be a great movie, but maybe because there is no drama, this movie hits me so hard. Boring narration, so ordinary story, no fancy editing (a little messy even) are the examples of our everyday lives. I can relate to Frances because she is an adult who does not have all her sh** together. She is awkward, irresponsible, and makes mistakes. She is not a heroine but neither am I. I know, however, I will get through as Frances does in the end. Gosh, this movie gives me more hope than any other movies which force grandiose message upon the audience because it succeeds in making audience identify himself/herself with the protagonist.",Frances Ha

Greta Gerwig stars in and co- wrote this portrait of Frances, who has a gig as an apprentice in a small dance troupe in New York. She is extremely devoted to her college friend Sophie (played by Mickey Sumner, Sting's daughter), and when she moves out of their apartment and starts a serious relationship with a man, Frances is thrown for a loop. There's more plot, but the plot isn't exactly the point of the film. It's mostly about Frances stumbles into a small improvement in her station after many setbacks and sets a path for herself on her own terms.",Frances Ha

Such an enchanting cinematic experience and a phenomenal performance from Greta Gerwig to boot. The writing is subtle and smart and the decision to shoot b&w works very well for the story.

I don't think I'm so awkward until I spend too much time with a person and then that seems to highlight my quirks.Walking around Paris alone listening to Hot Chocolate and basically doing nothing culturally significant is like something I would do.

In fact, Adam Driver from ""Girls"" is also in this movie! But if you like that show, you might like this (although I didn't). If you despise ""Girls,"" I can almost guarantee you won't like this movie. Unlikeable, spoiled characters throughout, with very little plot. Greta Gerwig is a disaster as Frances, and I think this is probably the last Noah Baumbach film I will be subjecting myself to. But because it was so critically revered, I thought I'd give it a shot.The only good thing about this movie is that it inexplicably got permission to use David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" and Hot Chocolate's ""Every 1's a Winner"" on the soundtrack.",Frances Ha
64,rooee,Frances Haha,7,28 July 2013,"The delightfully unaffected Greta Gerwig stole the show in writer-director Noah Baumbach's acerbic Greenberg, and now she co-writes and takes centre stage in its very funny follow-up.Gerwig plays the title character, a drifting 27-year-old dancing understudy, more goofy than quirky, despairing at the life decisions of her friends, whilst making some shockers of her own. This is really a love story between Frances and her BFF Sophie (Mickey Summer): friendship, fights, fun, and reconciliation, all coasting along sweetly on Baumbach's improvisational yet elegant style, this time in delicious monochrome. New York is a black and white city.The script is predictably well-observed, as are the naturalistic performances. At times the film feels slight; at other times aggravatingly self-aware. But overall it's so effortlessly amusing and relatable that it's hard not to root for our blundering heroine, however hipster her world appears.This'll make a fraction of what Grown-Ups 2 rakes in, but this will be the movie to stand the test of time. Is Baumbach the new Woody Allen? No, he's just Baumbach - and that's good enough.",Frances Ha

66,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,"Brava, Greta! Noah Baumbach's Best Since ""Squid""",9,30 November 2013,"""Were you supposed to hate all the characters?,"" a friend from Vermont wants to know. Okay, the Manhattan scenesters in ""Frances"" may not be paragons of self-knowledge or self-discipline, but I contend that the truly hateful characters are the ones in Baumbach's last two films, and even Greenberg kind of grows on you. Granted, this delayed-coming-of-age stuff has been explored before in many, many films and TV series, from ""Next Stop Greenwich Village"" to ""Girls,"" but ""Frances Ha"" gets it exactly right somehow. We start out pretty close to Lena Dunham Land, in fact, with two BFs snuggling in a Bklyn 1 BR, then move up, if only a little bit (though Adam Driver—he's in this one too—gets a much nicer apartment). Greta Gerwig is charmingly fragile and a little awkward in a good way as Frances; the film follows her through many vicissitudes, some the result of ""bad decisions,"" and frequent changes of address. Gerwig totally nails a delightful setpiece in which, a little drunk at a dinner party with people she doesn't know, ""undateable"" Frances expounds on her vision of true love. Misty b&w cinematography gives the film a timeless quality, though the presence of a fratboy investment banker and a couple of NARKs (nominally achieving rich kids?) reminds us that it's very much of today. Good work by Mickey Sumner as the elusive BF, Michael Zegen (he's in ""Girls"" now too) as the oddly compatible roommate and Grace Gummer as a rivalrous artgirl (she rolls her eyes when Frances makes her little speech about love). Gerwig co-wrote the almost perfect script with director Baumbach; I understand they're an item.",Frances Ha
67,jackasstrange,The best film which Woody Allen never made,8,12 March 2014,"Frances Ha is a very good film. And It's almost indisputable that Frances Ha resembles Woody Allen oldest works. The satire against the so-called intellectuals, the satire of a - perhaps ridicule aspect of society, that is the obsession with organization and patronizing, and the fact that the character - the protagonist - is an allegory, each one of these aspects are present in Frances Ha. Of course, there is some originality on here. The black and white choice, the occasional 80s beat which pops out of nowhere and ends fitting perfectly the scene, the great acting by Greta Gerwig - all of these are aspects which makes Frances Ha an unique film. And the dialogs are nothing like in Woody's films - sure about that. There is some surreal dark- humor on them, and adds to the uniqueness of the film in general. Overall, very well written, acted and directed. Certainly recommended. 8.5/10",Frances Ha
68,TheMarwood,"Be afraid, be very afraid",3,21 May 2014,"I hate Frances Ha. There I said it. I hate the movie, but I really hate the character. She's supposed to be cute and quirky, but I found her a deranged simpleton. A monstrous creature with an equally annoying and self centered friend. Greta Gerwig is basically just playing an extension to her Greenberg character, but without Ben Stiller yelling at her about how stupid she is. There's usually much to admire and enjoy in Noah Baumbach films, but here this is just a meandering film trying to float by on Gerwig's charms and I found this difficult to sit through. The issue I have is that Baumbach is clearly in love with the character -- sure she has her flaws, but the film wants us to love her back and I find her and the film grating.",Frances Ha

I did like her attitude when faced with her many setbacks. Movie scenes flashed by very quickly , others dragged. Black and White not really keen. Added nothing for me personally. Bit Woody Allen ish. I think if you like Woody movies you will like this. Greta Gerwig is a unique actress. She kinda plays the same character in most of them. Still, half marks.",Frances Ha

71,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Cute, Quirky, Charming",7,18 December 2013,"If you're into quirky comedies/coming of age stories, then I think you'll like this one. I found Frances (played by Greta Gerwig) likable. She was charming and funny. And although the story is about how she's lost in the world, she's full of life. And I think Greta played her wonderfully. I also like that this story didn't require a romance. You don't really see her date, she doesn't discover herself because she met a guy. Its kind of refreshing. The only real ""love story"" in it, is the love of friends. I also think it had a pretty good supporting cast. I especially liked Adam Driver as Lev and Michael Zegen as Benji. I also loved the wide shots of New York and Paris. Made me want to go there. And I thought it had a good soundtrack.Despite those things, there are some things I didn't care for. Like the urination scene. I know her character was drunk, but I just didn't really need to see her pee on the train tracks. I didn't think Grace Gummer was that great of an actress. I also didn't care for the way the director would show time elasping (the quick shots of them at a party for example, where there was no volume, but you would see them talk or laugh). I kind of found it annoying. Also, while I didn't find the Black and White distracting, I didn't think it really added anything to the film either.But overall I enjoyed it.",Frances Ha
72,BrickNash,A nice little film,9,27 August 2018,"The reviews section of this film are littered with some very bitter comments by people who obviously haven't done well in life and seem to want to blame it on a film. I come from a working class family, but I refuse to be so petty as to use a movie reviews section to rant about my own inadequacies rather than the film itself.Francis Ha is a sweet little film. Definitely not for everyone, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. It's dialogue heavy to the point where there is practically nothing else in the film but people talking, but fortunately I like those types of movies so I was quite at home watching these people go about their lives.The film is an obvious tribute to Woody Allen's Manhattan - right down to the black and white print, but it sets itself apart nicely and has much more of an indie film feel to it, almost like something out of the 90s.I don't think it's a film that you can just throw on like a Marvel or Schwarzenegger movie, but if you are in the mood for some nice light hearted drama then this is just the ticket.",Frances Ha
73,grnhair2001,I don't get these people,1,6 April 2014,"It's official. I hate this director's movies. I've been wondering why, and I have been wondering why I feel so angry about them, and it finally dawned on me: it's about class.See, I grew up working class, not indulged, and I had work for a living starting at age 16. I understand the value of hard work, sure, but I also understand the necessity for it for people like me. When I and my relatives have problems, they are real problems: cancer, loss of job that may result in homelessness, bearing for years an awful boss with 40 IQ points less than us because we need the boring job, alcoholism and no money to go to tony recovery resorts, having to eat beans and rice not from some eating disorder/fad but because that's all we can afford, living with dental pain for five years because we can't afford basic dentistry (much less teeth bleaching) and the grinding, endless truth of being stuck in our class because the uberwealthy won't allow us to move from it, no matter how well we follow the rules of careful education, careful savings, and hard work. So when I see these movies by overly indulged people and about overly indulged people, I get so angry I see red.I don't care about these people and their petty, self-invented ""problems."" I wish for them that they get hit by a truck and lose a leg or two and earn a real problem so they understand what BS this BS they make films about is. (not that such a thing would be a real problem for them like it would be for people of my class who can't afford good health care, but at least it wouldn't be more of this non-problem crap they get so whiny about in their whiny movies.) Movies like this make me wonder, and not for the first time, why there isn't a violent class revolution. Hey, we'd like just a year or two of experiencing these non-problem ""problems,"" too.

Strange flat sharing, embarrassing parties, going home for Christmas etc. (I loved the bit about finding a nearby cash-point). I have never seen Greta Gerwig in anything but her physical acting is brilliant.The film is a gentle naturally acted paean to growing up, or not.

75,TheFilmGuy1,Has Some Great Scenes But Overall Feels Like A Pointless Hipster Film,7,19 June 2014,"Where do I start? Well, this is a very hipster-ish film. I kind of hate using that term but it really is. It's extremely reminiscent of Girls, with the story being about a twenty-something year old white girl in New York that doesn't know what to do with her life and has many artsy friends. And it's in black and white. Why? Because it looks cool. The story at its core is about...well... I'm not really sure. The whole movie is about Frances not really knowing her place and not having her crap together in life. The movie follows her as she just kind of... roams in and out of characters and situations until the last 5 minutes where it kind of gets wrapped up, leaving you to just say ""oh...ok."" I understand that's kind of the point, and I actually like that idea, I just felt like it was a bit too aimless at times. But that's not to say there isn't good stuff. I liked the first little bit of the film. We had interesting characters, such as Adam Driver as Lev, who I loved but sadly just kinda goes away. The issue comes that later in the film, the characters we liked at the start just become... boring and kind of unlikeable. Frances starts off as aimless in a kind of connectable way. Later on she begins to feel aimless in a way that just kind of makes you say ""stop screwing around!"" Like she has opportunities but doesn't really take them. It just feels like eventually she has no drive and I lost my connection with her character. The film pretty much can be summed up in that word ""okay"". Frances won't get her life together... Okay. She goes to Paris... Okay. She gets a job at her old school... Okay. The film is in black and white just because... Okay then. How was the film you ask? It was okay. Had potential and had some good scenes, but let me down. Needed a bit more of a focus. It just kind of begins, gives you situations that kind of relate, and then ends.",Frances Ha
76,FilmMuscle,A Satisfyingly Quirky and Meaningful Study of Growing Up,8,16 November 2013,"I will likely keep this brief, but the film impressed me to the point where I felt the strong urge to write my honest feelings on the experience. Frances Ha presents the story of a 27-year-old (Frances) who doesn't exactly know where her life is leading her and what her future exactly holds. It's that sense of spontaneity and unpredictability that realistically portrays an average young adult who doesn't possess the luxury of wealthy or famous family/friends. No, she's forced to move from apartment to apartment, owned by various acquaintances, all while not exactly holding the most secure or respectable position at a dance company. Frances' quirky behavior and charming personality immediately displays the effective use of characterization within the film since Frances is arguably one of the strongest and distinct female characters I've ""met"" this year, and when I say ""met,"" I mean it because you practically know her better and better as the film progresses. Once you're familiar with her hint of awkwardness and peculiarity, the plot intrigues you that much more. Anyways, I found the acting superb. The writing- dialogue in particular- to be at the top of its game as crucial as it is to a film of this kind, being predominantly focused on conversation similar to the likes of the Before Trilogy. The cinematography was alluring, cleverly shot in black-and-white as to represent a mark of hipness. The great choice of music also services the charm of Frances' narrative. In the end, the story keeps you hooked the entire way, and its style and exploration of themes (growing up in a pressuring and daunting world, artificial friendship, and more) definitely helps Frances Ha stand as one of the most unique and pleasant viewings this year.",Frances Ha

78,IamROCKAS,I don't think I've ever seen a more relatable film before.,9,11 August 2020,"""I'm so embarrassed. I'm not a real person yet.""Some people move on with their lives. Some desperately try to hold on to their past. I'm still like the latter.I don't think there's a more relatable and human story than the one of Frances Ha, because it's best described as real life. Some scenes are dragged out to incredible lengths, every emotional scene is followed by a comedic and somewhat obscure moment - just like real life.We Follow Frances's life, one ever so depressing and relatable. She drinks, she has fun with her friends and she doesn't want to settle down with anything and that makes it hard to deny a connection with her life and mine. There are some tragic moments but Frances, despite the sad depressing things that happen to her, always laughs it off. Mark Twain has said that humor is tragedy plus time and I can't think of anyone as portrays that better than Frances.The reality that this movie portrays is not crushingly depressing and it even shines a light on topics like growing up, feeling loved, and moving on. I'd like to address three of my favorite scenes: first one is when Frances meets Levi and Benji, she feels so desperate to be loved that she cooks up omelets and even mentions that this was her best day since other unfortunate events, expecting some flattering, but not getting an answer to her statement, so she just leaves. The second one is when she has her One Moment speech, to which, again, nobody responds, and she leaves. And the third one is the conversation with the drunk Sophie in a single bed, where Frances's naive nature lets her believe that she can get back to her past life. What these three scenes have in common is that they are tragic but they portray Frances as the most sincere she can be and that reality-influenced behavior with emotional outbursts feels so real that you start to reflect on your own life.",Frances Ha
79,LilyDaleLady,Did we see the same movie?,2,10 September 2014,"I read such euphoric, glowing reviews of this film, I was expecting something truly special. I love ""The Squid and The Whale""; I have admired Gerwig in other films as a natural-looking and sweet actress. I like black and white films, New Wave ""homage"" and old Woody Allen films like ""Manhattan"".By the time I actually got to view this film, I was jazzed about it. It has incredibly high ratings on Rottentomatoes and other sites....so, major downer.The problem may be that since it came out, I've seen most of the TV series ""Girls"". It feels like ""Frances Ha"" is very derivative of ""Girls', or even Lena Dunham's earlier film ""Tiny Furniture"". The subject of loserish young women in Brooklyn -- living on their wealthy parent's dime -- is getting awfully tread-worn. I think directors and professional reviews (most of whom live in NYC or LA) have over-estimated how much this reflects the reality of life for young people today. Only a tiny percentage can afford this kind of la-di-da lifestyle, and the privations ordinary young people would really face are far worse than depicted here.Frances comes off far worse than even Dunham's Hannah Horvath (who is merely whiny, irritating and self-important). She is actually presented here as sweet, but semi-retarded -- a 27 year old divorcée (a point nearly every reviewer has MISSED) who is so childish that she skips & plays like a 10 year old, dresses like a little kid, has a female best friend (but no particular drive for a boyfriend or lover) with whom she holds hands like little kids -- Frances playacts at lesbianism, without the passion for that either -- runs in the street and urinates in public (may I say here: ewww).Like Hannah Horvath, she can manage to live in one of the most expensive areas in the nation, without a real job, because (apparently) her parents must be sending her thousands of dollars each year. There is no other way this adds up. Frances has no job -- she's an ""apprentice dancer"", which seems doubtful pays anything at a tiny company. She's not good enough to make the cut for a member of the company, which is painfully obvious from seeing Gerwig galumph around -- she isn't built at all like a dancer, she's broad in the shoulders, thick-waisted, with the oddest mannish walk.The filmmakers don't seem to have even the slightest clue about how hard dancers have to work -- the constant studio work, classes, workouts, DIETING -- obsession with their body (which is, of course, their tool). Frances mostly sleeps around all day. She doesn't take class. She doesn't audition. Any inclination that she might really be a choreographer is dumped on the audience in the last few minutes.The film follows Frances as she loses her apartment, when her roommate (the so-called ""best friend"") callously moves out and leaves her in the lurch. This makes the whole idea that the two women are inseparable, lover-like, intimate best friends very unbelievable. Who would not know this in advance? What kind of friend would move out in 2 days, knowing they would leave you homeless? Frances then moves from one acquaintance to another, crashing in their apartments, while doing....well, nothing in particular. Certainly not dancing, nor choreographing anything. She makes a disastrous, expensive trip to Paris -- mostly to show off to her better-off acquaintances -- and then has to spend the summer working at her old college as an RA.The most confusing bit for me was when Frances runs into her EX-HUSBAND (""we used to be married"") -- hello, this was never previously even hinted at. I don't even see the actor in the credits here! When was Frances married? for how long? when did she divorce? There isn't a word about what would have been a major relationship, lifestyle change, emotional upheaval. It might have well explained everything she does in the film, but it is dropped as a ""fact bomb"" near the end, unrelated to every single other thing in the plot. (For example, we are led to believe Frances is deeply attached her best friend Sophie, because she lacks the maturity to form a relationship with a man....but if she did fall in love & marry AND DIVORCE -- all since college only 5 years earlier -- she certainly did do those things, and recently.)It is a cheap shot, and one I have seen before, to have Sophie seem to have achieved adulthood and the ""perfect life"" with a rich boyfriend in Japan...only to quickly show it is all a sham, they are not in love and Sophie is drunkenly unhappy, and then it is really Frances who is doing OK after all. None of this is foreshadowed; it feels like wish fulfillment and sour grapes (""I'm so jealous of my friends, maybe they are not really as happy as they look!"").Sophie has been such a rotten, unfeeling and cruel ""friend"" to Frances, you can't help but hope she IS out of Frances' life forever.Lastly: at the end, Frances is shown happily in her OWN large apartment, with a wooded view (in Brooklyn?) that she can suddenly afford, on the pay from a part-time secretarial job with a tiny modern dance company. Say what? That's science fiction. Maybe this film was misshelved.",Frances Ha
80,pamma09,Not a total waste of my time,6,8 June 2013,"I love indie films and after reading so many good things about this film I really wanted to see it. I liked the black and white filming but it is too low key. The persons presented as friends either use each other, are lost in what they do, or just seem to exist.Frances is lacking in real desire to do what she says she wants to do - dance. She doesn't get it. Her best friend,Sophie - is more into making a life for herself - even with the mistakes she makes. Frances has odd conversations with her parents - the best part of her visit home was the bike ride in their neighborhood.This movie was lacking in many things for me. The connections between the people seemed shallow, the hopefulness doesn't come through till the last 15 minutes, the feeling of being lost is present for most of the movie. Most 27 years old I know are more mature than these presented. I rarely say I did not like a movie - because I am so picky in the ones I go to (no violence for the sake of entertainment) - but this one is a puzzle for me.

Having seen Baumbach's previous film Greenberg, what is Noah Baumbach's fascination with these hipster generation-Z characters that have an aversion for employment? Is Baumbach critiquing them, implying they should better people? No, Baumbach just navel gazes at the New York hipster sheik. Did I learn anything new about this generation's youth? No, because I already know people like this and generally avoid them.For instance, Frances seems to be afraid of the typical career ladder and desires something more. Dancing, what's she's established as her job, doesn't seem fulfilling. But being a waitress is out of the question because her privileged upbringing makes it humiliating. Meanwhile, things start to become financially difficult. She then starts to lie pathologically to keep up with her friends who have gone ahead in life. Is she active in discovering her passion? No, she just mopes around, hoping it'll hit her one day.And like that, the movie goes on and on. Even at 89 minutes, it felt long watching these characters mope along talking about nothing. Greta Gerwig is very good in the lead part and displays a considerable amount of depth playing a quarter life crisis. She captured that boomerang generation mentality to a tee. It succeeds at what it does as a character portrait, but it's truly interesting only when her character gets active. I just wished more things, whether comic, dramatic or tragic, happened so that she can be more compelling. For me, only the last 15 minutes were interesting. After all, there's only so much quirkiness one can take.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",Frances Ha
82,adeckofcards,Time to mature,9,28 December 2020,"Noah Baumbach's films are, by force majeure, self-referential. The director and screenwriter cannot avoid seeing and portraying himself or some stage of his life. However, in the case of 'Frances Ha' this is slightly reversed by the presence of its leading actress Greta Gerwig. Gerwig, another quintessential self-referent, plays this eternal teenager who dreams of being a dancer named Frances.
The film does not have anything new or that has not been seen before, in fact, sometimes it seems perhaps a mixture of ideas and styles. But it is Gerwig who gives this story a life of its own and a unique imprint.'Frances Ha' is more of a Greta Gerwig film than Noah Baumbach. This is not only due to the fact that she is listed as a co-writer and portrays a lot of her own life, but also because she is the soul of the work and gives it that sentimentality, innocence and nostalgia that was necessary. The strength of her on screen, the way she manages to take the story and give the character a recognizable identity, generates in the viewer such a deep bond, an inevitable feeling of infatuation and harmony that it is extremely easy to forget the failures of the film . And it is that, 'Frances Ha' could never have that level of life and authenticity without the presence of Greta Gerwig.However, despite the fact that Gerwig generates that brightness and light, this is still a film directed and written by Noah Baumbach and as such the everyday life of the story is the engine of the story. It is evident that the filmmaker has evolved and perfected his technique over the years, perhaps the highest point of his being 'The Meyerowitz Stories'. And likewise, his ability to balance drama and comedy has not yet reached the balance he had in 'Marriage Story', which means that 'Frances Ha' often does not know where to place herself. The film begins as an everyday comedy and ends in a kind of life lesson, passed in between by its influences from the musical and coming of age. It finally seems like a mixture of all of this cohesive in some way.Although Baumbach also has his successes and manages that this change in styles is not all bad. It achieves this in different ways, first by making the narrative go along and generating a perfect rhyme with the personality and mood of its protagonist. This is how we can go from seeing Frances dancing in the street to being depressed in Paris in a totally organic and natural way. But we will not deny that Gerwig once again influences this to be possible.
Second and most important, her greatest achievement is probably creating an atmosphere of nostalgia in its purest form and succeeding in winning over the viewer through a personal and unique identification.It is likely that 'Frances Ha' does not speak of anything different than what has already been told many times. But perhaps it achieves something even more important ... to capture a piece of life or a stage of it in an extremely honest way, sometimes comical, sometimes dramatic and of course with its own influences and mistakes, but life after all. A portrait drawn by its authors in a self-referential way in its maximum expression, but that in a strange way achieves a connection making us see that no matter how personal a work may be, it can also be universal, because finally we all live in the same way and it is the quest to capture this that makes this tape unique.I must admit that I have had a hard time writing this review. Mainly because it is full of closed ideas and that go nowhere. But I think that finally, like the film and its protagonist, not everything must have an absolute coherence or a specific direction. Clutter and not having a meaning can be the best in certain cases.",Frances Ha
83,john32935,Greta is amazing,7,20 January 2015,"At the time of its release. this movie received outstanding critical acclaim, yet the subject matter of a young person aimlessly drifting through life in New York City did not really appeal to me. I finally broke down and watched it. Foolish me for waiting so long.Greta Gerwig gives an outstanding performance as the title character. Frances is a wanna-be dancer without the dedication or resources to make this a realistic possibility. She eats carbs for goodness sake! But when her best friend and roommate Sophie decides to move out, Frances is set adrift trying to find a new apartment, then a new job, and finally a new life. Sometimes Frances' naiveté comes across as sweet, and other times it is annoying as you wonder how any 27 year old could be so unfocused. Through it all though, Greta's performance is spot on.",Frances Ha
84,Denno1972,Sad and joyful,7,16 February 2021,"This quirky film co-written by it's star Greta Gerwig and directed by Noel Baumbach is both sad and joyful. The film starts with a telling kid the story of it's main character Frances and her strong friendship with Sophie and whilst I found this beginning sweet enough it wasn't until that friendship broke down and Frances started to struggle in all aspects of her life, that the film really took hold for me. The cinematography, shot in black and white is very affecting and the acting all round is very good with most of the characters unsympathetic yet mainly likeable in an odd ball way. Overall, enjoyable but it wont be for everyone.",Frances Ha
85,tao902,"Frequently annoying, infrequently engaging.",4,22 July 2015,"A twenty-something woman, Frances, lives in New York, trying to build a career as a dancer and develop meaningful relationships.She's a disorganized, dreamy character searching for something solid in a transitory, superficial world. Despite her travails she remains positive and cheerful. As her career goal slips away from her and friendships prove unreliable she slowly matures to appreciate the more genuine elements of her life and take a more realistic view of her world.A film that might possibly be appreciated by a late teen/early twenty audience but others may well find it annoying.",Frances Ha
86,SpaaceMonkee,An Artistic Exploration of Why People Hate Millennials,5,22 October 2020,"In terms of personal taste, it's a 3, at very best. In terms of craft as a film, it's a 7, at least. Overall, as a millennial, I think this movie demonstrates why people hate millennials.The film centers on Frances Ha, a woman seemingly of average talent and average intelligence, though several portions of the film suggest she's a woman of slightly above-average talent and rather below-average intelligence.Frances moved to New York with the hopes of making it as a dancer, but the only creatives who make it in New York, the movie tells us, are the children of the wealthy, which Frances is not. Instead, she struggles to pay the rent while working as an understudy at a dance company. She's financially irresponsible and incapable of committing to a serious relationship. Instead, she leeches onto her best friend from college even though she's approaching thirty. When her best friend moves away and begins committing to a serious relationship, Frances lashes out.Whenever you have the inclination to feel sorry for Frances on this journey, you are relieved of that burden by watching the film for a few more minutes, during which time you start disliking her again, assuming you momentarily stopped in the first place.Ultimately, Frances learns that she's not good enough to cut it as a serious member of the dance company and instead she takes an office job there so that she can get free studio space, which allows her to explore her lesser ambition of staging dance productions for children. Along the way, she racks up credit card debt on an entirely frivolous weekend trip to France, humiliates herself while drunk at a dinner party, and returns to her college to take a summer job serving tables because the position offered free room and board.The acting is well done. But, the characters are awful, and it's unclear what the message is, if any. Pity those who choose to live in New York with rents they can't afford to pursue careers they won't get? A tragedy for the ages indeed.In sum, rarely has a film showcased such an infinitely unlikeable lead, but the movie nevertheless succeeds as a demonstration of the possibilities for happiness after dramatically lowering your expectations for what you expect of life and yourself.",Frances Ha
87,jmc4769,Frances Ha is no Manhattan,2,30 June 2013,"This movie didn't work at all for me. The biggest problem is the script. A good script needs characters who are interesting even if they aren't likable. But Frances is boring and her life is boring. The story rambles aimlessly on and on with little narrative arc. What you see is a series of episodes about different places Frances has lived but with little or no transition explaining how and why she has moved from one to the next.I heard writer and director, Noah Baumbach, say that he was inspired by Woody Allen's Manhattan. But his writing comes close to Allen's only in a few places. There are two or three mildly amusing lines in the movie. That's it. I saw it in a half-full theater and heard only a couple of chuckles from the audience the entire time. And I don't think loving the movie, Manhattan, is a good enough reason to shoot in black and white. It worked for Woody, partly because the cinematography was gorgeous, but here it makes an already dull movie even more colorless.A little of Greta Gerwig goes a long way. She can be really good in the right role, but she's a little too gawky to be appealing in every role she's in, especially when she's expected to carry the movie. She was enjoyable in a supporting role in To Rome with Love and wonderful in Maggie's Plan. But without the right script and director, as in this movie, her awkwardness can become annoying.A better movie on the same subject is Walking and Talking. But if you want to see a truly outstanding drama about a young woman who doesn't have her act together, watch the HBO series, Enlightened.",Frances Ha
88,archiecm,Painfully uncomfortable until the last two minutes.,6,2 August 2015,"I didn't like Frances at all. Her insecurities were painful to watch. She didn't have any redeeming qualities. She wasn't funny, or particularly smart. She wasn't good at anything. She kept making mistakes and saying awkward things. I stopped watching and reexamined ""What the Flick's"" review because Christie Lamire loved every frame of the movie. So did Alonso. That didn't help. It took me three sittings to get through it and the last half hour I kept saying, ""It's gotta end at some point. It's gotta."" The Paris trip was the worst. She did nothing there but eat and presumably use the bathroom. Her friend who was there didn't get her messages so they missed each other totally. She didn't even tell her best friend she was in Paris when they were on the phone. WHAT KIND OF BEST FRIEND IS THAT? I wonder. And she lied about still being a dancer to her friend as well. She couldn't sink any lower in my book. Then, she choreographs this dance number with about twenty dancers and I was so blown away by the sheer beauty of it that I started crying. I'd never seen dancers interact quite like that before. ""My God! She DOES know how to do something!"" I was totally blown away. It was a long time coming. And I had to wonder if a movie can be good if you only liked it after you see the ending. I don't think so but I'm not sure. How would you convince a friend to stick with a losing movie because it all came out OK in the end. It was a sweet end though and I'm not sorry I watched it because of that.",Frances Ha

90,SweetWilliam63,"Frances ""La Dee Da, La Dee Da, La La""",8,16 May 2019,"Before all the hoopla surrounding 'Lady Bird', Greta Gerwig was making a name for herself as the indie ""it"" girl. A mix of Diane Keaton and Grace Kelly. Developing her career as an actress in the softer light of a host of delightful indie pics, including 'Mistress America' (2015), which she co-wrote and Lola Versus (2015), Gerwig is all raw emotion and naked neurosis. She is unafraid to portray unnervingly fractured, hapless, fatigued, sexually clumsy characters. The creative offspring of such indie legends like John Cassavettes and Shirley Clarke. 'Frances Ha' is sweet, delightful and never the less consequential. Unwilling to be confined within the weak list of movie tropes, the film flirts with romance but quickly establishes Frances as a women who is open to love but not needful or desperate for it. One of my favourite movies.",Frances Ha

I like how they protray the ups and downs of friendship. And the monolgue about the party.However, it is rather boring. Nothing is getting me hooked. I kinda have to force myself to finish it.

92,thegodfathersaga,sincerity in content and narrative,8,13 December 2013,"from the start, this film possesses that likability factor of having the indie, black and white and ordinary people appeal to it. the use of black and white coupled with the subtle lighting is really effective and keeps the visual aspects well within control. that's a good decision, i think, now realizing that black and white is a better conductor for raw emotions. color really improves on the foundation, of what is there on the image, it is supposed to add visual interest and importance; so if one doesn't wanna bother with conceiving those layers, black and white is the way to go.Frances is a very lovable character with a good heart, good intentions and a good dose of awkward and quirk. Greta Gerwig is great on screen playing her with vibrancy, care and transparency. you can tell it was personal to Gerwig, helping also in writing a clever but not a pretentious script, that's consciously trying to stay emotive and real to a bohemian life of a New Yorker verging on adulthood, refusing to raise any conventional and unnecessary stakes, story wise. i think it achieves what it sets out to, and advocates sincerity in its content and its narrative.",Frances Ha

94,paultreloar75,"You spin me right round, baby right round",8,31 July 2013,"When I arrived at my local movie emporium tonight, the queue snaked out of the doors and up the street, and comprised mainly of young couples leaning in to chatter and throwing heads back to laugh. I almost turned around and walked back the other way, so I'm glad to report that I persevered and made the effort to stay in line.Which is very much in keeping with this delightfully optimistic, warmly affectionate portrait of our (nearly) epomymous heroine Frances, or Fran to those that know her well. Greta Gerwig is who this film is all about, and I thought she gave a wonderfully angular performance that avoids cheap laughs and pulls you into her increasingly dysfunctional life.The pace of the plot is pleasant enough, the story is pretty straightforward and the supporting cast do a good job in bringing to life a bunch of people who seem real in a way that's not always easy to achieve (think Juno, for example). It's nicely shot and New York usually provides a pleasing backdrop for a film.It even pulls off the trick of making the end a happy one, without falling into schmaltz, which was well received by me at least. The bad dancing is skillfully done, the marriage of sound and images is pretty solid, and the dinner party in particular is a real cracker. Although I was essentially undateable tonight compared to my fellow patrons, I walked home with a healthy glow in my belly.",Frances Ha
95,saschakrieger,The Undatable Woman,7,29 July 2013,"Frances is twenty seven and drifting through life. Her dancing career doesn't take off, she clings to her best friend unaware that she is ready to move on, makes her boyfriend break up with her and stumbles from one unstable environment to another. She is silly and childish and unreliable, a woman refusing or unable to grow up when all around her do. She has no aim, no goal, but loads of insecurity and doubts. She is obnoxious, annoying, clumsy, but also charming much in the way a child would be. She also isn't looking too bad which helps. A young woman at a crossroads, unsure what to do with hr life – not an entirely new subject. Director Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig who plays Frances wrote the script for Frances Ha together – and they have managed, as writers, director and actress, to turn and old story into a humorous, touching and imaginative tale about how hard it can be to grow up when all you want to do is live but don't know how.The film is shot in black and white which gives it a sense of distance, like a wondrous tale from long ago. at the same time it has an impressionistic feel: with its fast-paced almost fragmentary sequences of fleeting moments, its jumping in and out of Frances' life without explaining or narrating the periods in-between, its use of music which can highlight emotional peaks, serve as ironic counterpoints or give the scene an almost fairy-tale touch. It is a series of moments, the fragments, a life consists of, and a collection of places. Places she lives at or visits, a topography of someone without a clear direction. The turning points are not of the most original sort – the friend moving on to a more steady life and an engagement, her career stalling – yet, Frances Ha has a directness and a very unique rhythm that keep them fresh and, one could say real. This is at least partly the fault of Gerwig whose portrayal of this drifter is entirely believable and at the same time just a notch over the top to make it humorous and install a very fine sense of irony into the story of this ""undatable"" (as goes a running gag) woman.Frances Ha will not go down in film history, it is after all, first and foremost, a lightly entertaining film with what could be called an optimistic if not a happy ending as Frances finally finds a sense of direction and a purpose in life. However, with its very own rhythm and cinematographic language, its distancing black and white and its captivating protagonist, Baumbach's latest film is a consistent and rather different take on the old subgenre of the coming of age film: very enjoyable, at times moving, always engaging and not all that easily forgettable.

I have formed my relationship to Greta in achronological order, knowing her first as writer/director for Lady Bird and her adaption of Little Women, I knew not what talent she had for this side of the camera. It is one thing to interpose one's self onto a character and another thing entirely to allow that character to reveal themselves in you, but Frances's (Greta's) weird, square-pegged, clutz that longs for real companionship is inescapably relatable. Baumbach and she are geniuses of the human emotional note.",Frances Ha

98,rsj624,Indie All the Way Through,7,12 December 2013,"--WARNING: There are some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Frances Ha at this moment epitomizes what fans of indie films want to see. Lacking any big name Hollywood stars, any color, any CGI, epic action; mostly lacking everything but it's template for narrative in the form of a bare bones portrayal of when life happens to a near unbreakable friendship.Frances moves through life passively waiting for the day that it all begins, only to find that through her best friend Sophie's new relationship with boyfriend 'Patch' growing into a serious next phase of life, that her very own life may actually be passing her by. As she begins to move forward, in clumsy, funny, Earnest, and honest ways that only one such as herself can, it's hard to find sympathy for her character, but understanding her in all her uniqueness and finding humor in her quirkiness never feels challenging, and her development from beginning to end is organic and inspiring, even if fleeting and simple while in motion.Where Frances Ha succeeds most is in the simplicity of all these complicated elements surrounding Frances, the film itself is not meant to be a character study, but so much of it is center around her, that everyone can't help but feel like a part of her world, rather than her being a part of ours. Rather than hinder the film, this allows for a deeper understanding of her perception, or lack there of, and her grip on reality as she spirals in and out of one hole and into another before finally making sense of everything by films end.It's also nice to see a movie not completely condemn having a normal 9-5 job as the death of all dreams, but rather providing the financial platform to help aid ones own hobbies that have potential to turn into money making dreams down the road. Frances Ha is a good watch, but it's far from the best in a growing field of films shamelessly indie. It does, however, harken back to the days of independent cinema long since gone; and that alone merits a watch or two.",Frances Ha

102,Norwegianheretic,Something Truly Fresh,9,18 May 2013,"It has been years since I've seen a film by a young (relatively) director like Noah Baumbach that didn't smack of self centeredness or severe plagiarism (though it must be noted that the score was pleasantly guilty of plagiarizing French New Wave soundtracks, most likely ones by Georges Delerue). Frances Ha is in unpretentious black and white - in other words, Baumbach uses the style as God meant it to be used and that is to get intimate with a character in a way that is more innocent than you find in most colored films.At first, I was slow to warm up to the film but the lead performance and the dialog throughout the film is so strikingly fresh that it made me feel (at my advanced age of 60) that young people still do have brains. I particularly enjoyed the observation made by Frances, at a dinner party, that when someone has a kid and believes they are less egocentric, the belief is a fraud because their fawning, though not directly over themselves, is still clearly self directed since they made the children. This one observation by the character is enough to make her transcend the stigma of being generational. Frances is just as fresh and likable a character if she was created in France in the sixties or Germany in the 1920'a. The character is genuine, no small feat to accomplish at any period in film history. And while there is a sense of longed for nostalgia (the writers seem to wish that they had been born in the fifties), there are few films that are more immediate and genuine in conveying that horrifying period which is your twenties.",Frances Ha
103,BlueFairyBlog,Mumblecore Has a Maven,9,19 November 2014,"Recently a trend has been emerging in writing for both television and film that includes story lines revolving around the plight of the Millennial generation and the woes of the twenty something. The start of it can probably be traced to the boom in Lena Dunham's career and her writing for the HBO series ""Girls"". Her independent film ""Tiny Furniture"" was a great precursor to her show, and also featured a slightly overweight protagonist (played by Dunham) who has money woes after college and finds herself relying on the help of her parents. ""Frances Ha"" takes on some of the same ideals that have been popping up lately, but doesn't have the same empathy for those without direction that Dunham affords easily. Instead, collaborative screen writing team, and real-life couple, director Noah Baumbach and star Greta Gerwig, find a middle ground, content to show the troubles of artists, but also tells them to take stock of what's important and live their lives. Frances is a modern dancer in a company where she isn't excelling as fast as she would like. Her roommate suddenly uproots herself and begins a new kind of life, where she cares less about her career and more about her apartment and boyfriend. Frances finds herself homeless from time to time, jobless once in a while, and consistently scrambling to find herself amongst everyone else. The film continually stays funny, especially because the characters are so vibrant. Baumbach has a way of capturing the hilarity in being uncomfortable, and forces characters on screen that are interesting but inevitably intense. Gerwig, always lighthearted but methodical to her characters, lightens the tone somewhat. This, their first collaboration, feels so fresh and young, yet features a strange wisdom that shows the writers are really old souls. There's not been a film that perfectly balances the opinions of this generation and the reality of our world while staying so sweetly funny throughout, and I commend these two for pulling it off flawlessly.",Frances Ha

Outside of changes of zip codes, nothing much appears to happen; this is an ode to friendship, however fraught and delicate friendships can be. Essentially, this story follows Frances (like Catherine Moreland, in Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey"", she falls into the category of those who would never have been supposed to be born an heroine) as she floats through her life, leaving little indelible impression on her surroundings. She is vulnerable, and yet has a resiliency which seemingly will carry her through all of her gaffes and miscues.

Don't believe the pompous guff that I've read in some of the newspapers - that's how I ended up watching this unsatisfying offering.Without giving away too much of the plot (there isn't one) this film drifts around a lazy, vacuous, self obsessed dancer (who doesn't need to do much dancing, or much anything come to it) as she annoys and judges her few friends and virtually stalks her old college girlfriend.It's unclear where she gets her sense of entitlement from and thankfully, this isn't pursued. What passes for humour extends as far as her zany querkiness which soon wears thin. Anyone who has met (or even dated) one of these types of women will know that the attraction soon wears off - and they rapidly become irritating.The narrative soon becomes as directionless as Frances' life - and a completely pointless and unconvincing trip to Paris is used to boost the interest temporarily. One gets the feeling that the episode has been shoe-horned in to show Frances walking some different kinds of streets, accompanied by some nice shots of the city.Very few of the characters gender any sympathy - perhaps artsy people are the same the world over but it does seem that NY has more than its' fair share.

I liked it, because it reminded me of that period of my life--mid-20s, when we were all trying so hard to accomplish something and make something of our lives. ""Making plans and dreaming of the future."" And wondering where our personal lives were going. (I even dated an aspiring 'modern dancer' for a while back then. Like Frances here, she was sharing an apartment with two friends from college days--but they all went their separate ways pretty soon, in real life.)So it made me remember a lot of the people I knew then, and the situations we were all in then. And I can't say that our own adult lives since then have gotten any easier for any of us, but we have discovered that trying very hard does not always produce happy rewards or results. ""Things that will hit you that you don't see coming.."" Etc.! But I also can't say that this movie shows any of the real people or actual predicaments or activities that people I know went through in our 20s.

108,generationfilm,Frances Ha- A Disarmingly Sweet and Perceptively Witty Reflection on Mid-Twenties Malaise from Auteur Noah Baumbach,8,16 May 2013,"Auteur filmmaker Noah Baumbach has specialized throughout his career in humorlessly reflecting on the various purgatories in our lives, or rather those lost years of stasis where the unknowns of life's supposed plans hit the unknowns within ourselves head on. His study of post-collegiate malaise in Kicking and Screaming was the genesis of his uniquely quirky vision—a blend of Whit Stillman's observationally verbose wit and Woody Allen's hilarious yet humanist portraits—that has carried on to other notable character studies he's penned, such as the dysfunctional family drama The Squid and the Whale and the mid-life crisis comedy Greenberg. It was clear in the most sincere moments of the film Greenberg that Baumbach had a creative chemistry with one of its stars Greta Gerwig which has resulted in a new collaborative effort between them to create Baumbach's latest poignantly comedic film entitled Frances Ha, an energetically funny yet undeniably relatable contemplation on the aloof mid-twenties condition. Utilizing crisp black & white cinematography capturing the naturalistic backdrops of New York City, Sacramento, and Paris, Frances Ha possesses an alluring charm mostly through Greta Gerwig's charismatic performance but also in the film's embodiment of French New Wave revivalism that allows substance to shine in even the most monotonous of human interactions. This short and sweet tale on the ambiguity of adult life highlights the changing nature of responsibility, friendship, and love with a surprisingly modest and heartfelt genuineness rarely experienced in film. Though it might have some minor similarities to Lena Dunham's HBO show ""Girls"" there is no denying that Frances Ha is distinctly Baumbach in character design, cinematic style, and written cleverness. Protagonist Frances proclaims that she ""loves things that appear as mistakes"" which on its face is the eloquent sentiment that summarizes the film's genuine depiction of mid-twenties paralysis in the face of responsibility. Frances Ha ranks highly in Noah Baumbach's worthwhile filmography because it is probably his most accessible, authentically charming, and least pretentious film all thanks to the screen writing aid and engaging performance from Greta Gerwig.",Frances Ha
109,FrostyChud,Depressing,5,6 August 2013,"I almost walked out of this one after ten minutes. Frances and Sophie are two silly, immature young women in a world that is organized around the fantasy of an eternal childhood. Everyone is shallow and clever. Nothing matters. Frances grows more likable over the course of the film. We want to see her humbled because she needs to be humbled. It is only when she begins to make sacrifices that we can begin to empathize with her. Everyone in this movie needs to be humbled. Sophie is particularly unlikable.What Frances needs is a man. Men and women need each other, and this is an idea that doesn't get a lot of traction in the demographic Frances belongs to. Everyone in the movie suffers from some version of this refusal. Sophie and Patch take refuge in a sterile simulacrum of a couple. Lev racks up the meaningless conquests. Benji and Frances act like prepubescent children. The director implies that Frances and Benji get together in the end. Well, that's a step forward, but they are not meant for each other. Frances needs a real man, and Benji needs a real woman. Benji is a dog's name, not a man's name. Benji acts like a dog, not a man. Benji isn't even a cool dog like a Pit or a Tosa Inu. Benji's eager masochism made me cringe. Frances is not much better, but she is better, and she deserves better than this goofy, wimpy chump. What chilled me most about this movie was realizing that this empty discourse, a form of passive lying, now passes for truth. The epistemological model that all of these characters implicitly adhere to (their definitions of love, masculinity, femininity, success, truth) is shallow and impotent. Frances' success comes too easily at the end. She hadn't hit bottom yet and for that reason it rings false.Ideology.",Frances Ha

It was somewhat intriguing, beautifully shot (in black and white), and the lead character was perfectly cast. I love quirky characters in independent movies, but most of the time I couldn't decide if Frances was incredibly endearing or incredibly annoying. Immature, yes. Quirky, yes. Childlike, yes.I didn't by any means hate this movie, but I did not love it as much as others. It is a film like no other, and worth a watch, but it left me feeling ambivalent. There was really no plot, which made sense because Frances didn't really seem to have any clearcut goals or ambitions (other than being a dancer, which wasn't ever going to happen). She lived moment by moment and the film took us on her journeys even though I am not sure they served much of a purpose.",Frances Ha
111,dparag14,Viabrant and Surreal,7,24 September 2016,"Noah Baumbach has done a wonderful job. This movie is like a dream. Shot in Black & White, it shows real art. Storyline shows France (Greta Gerwig) as a happy-go-lucky youth trying to live to her fullest. Earning money by dancing, she is just living it up. Her character is so vibrant and dreamy, it just makes you envy her. Her best friend, Sophie(Mickey Sumner) leaves her to be with her boyfriend; which leaves Frances alone and homeless. She is also sacked from her job, which complicates situations even more. Even though she has a lot of problems, she acts joyous. Cinematography is pretty neat. Depicts New York and Paris very well. Although its all B&W, it gives a conceptual feel. Production is very apt. It depicts the feel of the characters and their emotions. All the actors have done an amazing job. Makes you feel genuine. Overall, the movie is very entertaining, plus the tracks in background show a really good taste in music. Adds a unique feel to the picture.",Frances Ha

The acting was a bit mediocre though.I did like a lot of the camera shots and the black and white added something extra to the film.

The conversation between the female friends at the beginning of the move was unacceptable and degrading to women so this is not a true representation of how young women speak about their relationships to other women. It sounded as if a man wrote the dialogue as he would wish women would speak. It ruined the movie for me.,Frances Ha
114,Rachel_Dunphey,Coming of Age,6,12 January 2020,"I have recently become a fan of Noah Baumbach's work after watching his most recent (as of when this review was written) movie Marriage Story. As always he has done a great job with the casting. Every character was spot on and real, no matter how important they were. The cinematography of this film is also stunning. It was daring to film it in black and white, seeing as it could be written off as an ""older movie"" by younger film enthusiasts, but it fit the movie very well.Noah seems to have a common ""coming of age"" or ""slice of life"" feel to his movies; for example, While We're Young (shot after Frances Ha) deals with a similar theme of growing up but from a different perspective. I really enjoy how he captures the feeling that no one is really an adult, only a child in a mask. His movies make you think, and even though they may be specific story's to the character they somehow have a universal feeling to them. That anyone can understand no matter what there age or where they are from.The movie was beautiful; however, there was a few things that kept me from giving it a higher rating.While I do think that Greta Gerwig (Frances) did a great job in her acting, the character pulled me out of the movie sometimes due to her excessive quirkiness. I believe she was written this way but sometimes it really bothered me how she couldn't pick up on obvious social cues. I am willing to admit this complaint might be a personal problem though. Seeing as this characters lack of social awareness embodied one of my greatest fears of not being aware when it is time to stop.My second complaint would be that some of the characters went in and out of the story too fast. Specificity Lev (Adam Driver) and Benji (Michael Zegen). I feel as though we could have got to know them on the more personal level that Frances seemed to, especially with Benji.Overall it was a good film and I would recommend to watch it. Especially if you are looking for a sweet ""slice of life"" movie.",Frances Ha
115,JJthebat,Good,7,10 April 2020,"Noah Baumbach has showed himself to be one of the most interesting filmmakers working today, being an incredibly talented director and writer. And from the films i've seen from him, this is one of his more unique ones. not only because it's his shortest one, and also being co-written by Greta Gerwig, but because how personal but also how magical it feels.According to Baumbach, the ""black and white"" look the film is to reflect the barebones, simple presentation of the film, and also giving the film a sense of nostalgia. But in my personal view, i saw it as way to reflect how Frances may see, or may want to see, her life: as a film, more especifically, a kind of fairy tale/story about her dreams and aspirations.
Frances is a very interesting but also relatable character. Her life is a mess. She has dreams of success despite not being very talented. She goes back and forth on making decisions. She tries to be friendly but can often feel akward and nervous around people, etc. And she's not the only one with internal problems. Benji clearly has an interest on Frances but can't express it. Sophie can have relationship problems and lie about how good her life is. This are all things that Frances (and a lot of other people) struggles with. And yet she appears to be almost oblivious to this, since she thinks everyone but her has their lives figured out, even if it's not true.The film also has a lot of Baumbach's stylistic choices, like his hard and rapid cuts, both in visual and audio, his natural but carefully crafted dialogue scenes, and his ironic and dark sense of humor. The use of music is also very effective.
And despite the film's legth, it does have a pretty good structure, making you feel like you have really gotten to know this girl and the way she interacts.I would say that the main issue with this film would be it's ending. Not that it was a bad ending, in fact, i would say it was pretty effective it what it was trying to say. It just felt too short and a bit rushed for me to get to that point. Maybe if it was 10 to 15 minutes longer i would have felt it more natural in it's progression. And also (and this is not really the movie's fault), while the film is pretty well made in it's own right, it pales in comparison to Baumbach's other films. Adam Driver is pretty good in this film, but looking back at his role in Marriage Story, he's nowhere near as incredible as he is in that film.In conclusion, check out this movie whenever you get the chance. If you're a big fan of Baumbach's movies then you'll probably enjoy it. And it can also be a good introduction to his films if you're unfamiliar with him, although it might not be as amaizing as some of his other works. As it's own, Frances Ha delivers a heartful and enjoyable story where you will most likely find something to connect with.",Frances Ha
116,gwmdeclare,Ignorance is arrogant bliss.,1,20 November 2013,"So, incidentally, Frances is an apprentice dancer for a professional dance company in NYC at the age of 27. This is absurdly out of touch with the realities of the dance world. If she were so fortunate to be associated with a professional dance company, she would have had to be focused and disciplined enough to endure a physical regimen that would have trumped all of this silly girl's petty indulgences. The movie is a fantasy about an ignorant and condescending, wannabe charmer who has no idea nor any interest in the art of dance or the daily struggles of anyone anywhere. Please, who cares what happens to this phony, self- indulgent poseur and her gang of narcissistic friends. No mention of the harsh realities that prevail outside her bubble world. A movie that inadvertently but perfectly indicts the superficial sensibilities of these spoiled children and the makers of this movie.

For example, she said ""others must think that I am standing in front of the camera and impromptually speaking lines and then the screenwriter has my name"".

118,atiyaahsan,"You seem older, but, like less grown-up...It's weird!",9,25 November 2013,"The latest offering in the series of mumblecore movies done by Greta Gerwig, and probably her best, thus far. Though I've enjoyed most of her work comprising realistic life situations with naturalistic dialogues, but they all seemed to drag on a bit or rather weren't as engaging as this one. The dialogues are natural and thought provoking as ever, the editing more crisp, and the characters are all believable. This movie show cases the life of an average 20 something woman living in the big apple, but who, as so eloquently pointed out by one of her roommates, ""doesn't have her sh** together."" We've all been through this phase of life where we haven't got everything figured out, where we are sort of experimenting & trying out new things, new places, and new relationships in an attempt to figure out where we fit in. Frances (Greta Gerwig) struggles with day-to-day stuff like rent, shifts in career, people and friends coming and going out of her life or growing further apart, all part and parcel of life. The intricacies and undercurrents portrayed in the relationship between Frances and her best friend, Sophie are spot on; we all have that one person in our lives, it could be our best friend/our mother/brother/sister/spouse or anybody....that one person who gets all our inside jokes, around whom we don't have to pretend to be somebody else, who we can bare our souls to and not have to worry about what the other person might think, and yes who, as Frances, in a sudden bout of insightfulness proclaimed, ""you can just look across the room (in a party full of people) and catch each other's eyes, but not because you're possessive or that it's precisely sexual, but because....that is your person in this life...that's what I want out of a relationship...or life...love...I sound like I'm stoned...

And Greta's performance was really great, you can see in her eyes when she's happy, sad, angry and in love.
The friendship between her and Mickey Sumner was exquisitely beautiful, it was written and performed perfectly, the chemistry between Greta and Mickey was remarkable.I'd like to appreciate the charming dialogue which was realistic, interesting and funny.
Writers when they trying to write a realistic dialogue most of the time they end up with a boring one, but definitely this dialogue wasn't.The movie was fast paced but it wasn't rushed, we saw her growing up journey without any moment of boring, and all the credits go to the editing and the fast cuts.

120,Sintz49,A film that reveals critics have real insights,1,17 June 2018,"Okay, many reviews are full of just grumpy complaints on Frances Ha; but I agree with most. My favorite review though, is by ""nico-hvi"" on Sept 8, 2013. That review is brief, insightful and readable; it even shares one well chosen quote from the film that demonstrate this critic's statements. Helpful, cuz my take on Frances Ha was not this clear! On my gut level, I watched the film on cable TV, or some of it, for after about 12 minutes, I zipped ahead, about 8 minutes, but it felt like I'd landed again in the same scene (zipped @ 8 min intervals until the end). I've never seen characters continuously spend time together, but never seeming to get connected. Many (negative) reviews here do well to better point out the vacancy & lack of attentive interactions between any of the characters. Reading these reviews echoed my own feelings, but also put those feelings into words! You could say that many of the reviews here enlightened me about maturing and just connecting with people and life.... all the things that the film itself had failed to do. One quick reference: Jane Austen seemed to present in her novels this type of blindness in persons & culture, convincingly. Any of us might fail to see and own-up to who we are (even in part), and once you enter the cul-de-sac it is very hard to exit, and reconnect. Thanks to the many of you who wrote enlightening analysis of this film's problems.",Frances Ha
121,Moviefreak4653,A Graceful and Satisfying Piece,8,17 July 2013,"Noah Baumbach is sometimes a hit or miss with me. When he misses? It's not a huge miss, but it is a miss. I wasn't a fan of his previous film, and collaboration with Greta Gerwig, Greenberg, which I felt had characters that weren't developed enough and that were too forced in terms of wanting to be likable, but seeming ""real"" and ""hurt."" However, when he hits, he hits hard. There wasn't a character in Kicking and Screaming or Highball whom you didn't already know someone like, The Squid and the Whale hit way too close to home, and Margot at the Wedding wasn't a film that you easily forgot; however, his style is not for everyone. If you're not a fan of dark"" don't know whether to laugh,"" humor, and/or unlikable characters, than you probably wouldn't like his other films; notice I wrote other films. Of all his films, Frances Ha is probably his most lighthearted (I think Greta Gerwig's collaboration is to credit for that), but even still it has it's ""real"" world problems moments. Unlike his other films, here it actually seems to provide an encouraging, or at least, honest (as opposed to his normal brutal honesty) approach that material like Frances Ha deserves. Too put it simply, Frances Ha is a strong hit for Noah's career, and is a film that defines an age group and period in most everyone's lives.I almost hate to write this, but Frances Ha seems to be part of (or marketed as) this new trend involving young adults trying to adapt to life, but also providing some quirkiness to the situations and characters. I think this film is more relatable and while it's honesty is kind of sad in that ""the truth hurts"" way, because it involves reading between the lines, it's honesty is more of a tender gentleness that, like in our lives, we just have to accept. It doesn't rely on the typical hipster dialogue that so many of independent films think they need in order to stand out, but feels more like conversations that you've listened to and/or been a part of yourself. Never do the conversations feel unrealistic, and they never seem to go out for ""shock value."" The entire film isn't thankfully centered on sexual mishaps and social misfires, but more of an adaptation to the world around you in the growing up process.The plot progression is a lot like Frances herself, not really directed, kind of planned but mostly random, and, while it walks a fine line in some parts, it never entirely ever burns itself out on a particular location or supporting characters. Granted, toward the last act this technique becomes a little too forced and hard for the audience to believe, but the material is still right and seems to have justification for where it takes the story. I do, however, wonder if the spontaneous use of alternating locations is done for comedic purposes or to build dramatic tension? While it does further progress Frances' sadness with adapting to her life and where it's going, many times certain scenes, while overall good scenes, feel a little bit like missed opportunities to expand the characters more, or at least, not strictly confide them to awkward conversation.It's impossible not to love, or at least admire, Greta Gerwig's portrayal of Frances; I think it's driven enough to where she never really gets on your nerves, if she does, it's often understandable. She does give Frances a bit of a naive sense, but never to a point to where you think she's being childish. You don't entirely question her decisions, and you always empathize with her, if only because we've all been in her shoes. Frances could have easily been this wannabe hipster or desperately forced ""free spirit,"" but she's really not. Sure, she has her moments, but at that age, trying to maybe cling to whatever shred of youth you have left? Why not? Most admirable, however, is Gerwig's quiet restraint that Frances has. Frances could have been this obnoxious, erratic free spirit, but in the real world, most people don't say how they feel, and Gerwig captures that perfectly. Her half widen smiles, the look of hesitation in her eyes, and the forced laughter all the more hits close to home with the viewers.The element that really won me over with the film is its honesty. I think, whether we want to admit it or not, it defines a certain age group, and it maybe the majority of the world. What happens when you're suddenly having to grow up? Where do you go from when you realize that your dreams most likely will never come true? What happens when being alone seems all to plausible? You settle. It captures this perfectly because it never makes it seem like it's a bad thing, but obviously, not entirely showing it's a good thing. It is what it is - you do what you have to do. The film is optimistic about that, and furthermore perfectly exemplifies this with the final shot of the film, guaranteed to put a smile on the face of anyone watching, and definitely guaranteed to trigger a ""Oh so that's why it's called,"" moment.Overall, Frances Ha is certainly a highlight in not only both Baumbach's and Gerwig's career, but also a strong highlight for this year. I imagine the film will be boring for some, and tiresome for others, for, like I said, it really is in one's best interest to read between the lines to better understand and take in the film. Noah Baumbach claims to be reinventing himself with this film, while I'm not really sure what he means by that (the film closely resembles the likes of his early work, in my opinion), but if his next film is as enchanting as Frances Ha?

I thought Baumbach's direction is brilliant, it's not corny nor cheesy, it's just there and perfect. The screenplay is near masterpiece and Gerwig's performance is really good, she and the film definitely deserve independent spirit award nods.I'm glad it is not titled 'The Apartment', well who would be that stupid to make that decision. This film does tell you about the character's struggle to find a life in a comedy way which makes this film really special and worth watching.

As soon as she moves in with the two guys, the mood lifts because of their performance, but also because they are drawn very accurately. All the other people in her life are dull, one dimensional and predictable.

Yet, that doesn't diminish her fantasy of becoming a dancer. So, at the commence of her adulthood to take up responsibility, Frances struggle to find a place to live in and her quirkiness might not be well regarded by other people around her. At the start of the film, Dan (played by Michael Esper) wanted to move in with Frances yet she was considerate with her best friend Sophie (played by Mickey Sumner) as they were living at the same apartment together. Yet, Sophie wanted to move out of the apartment and lived with her boyfriend which turned out to be a dilemma for Frances as she would have no one to share the rent with.Greta Gerwig's performance as Frances was exceptional, she's a perfect portrayal of a 27 years old refusing to grow up and suffer from all those growing up issues such as not being able to pay the rent and fall out with her best friend. She is gauche and seemingly weird to outsiders and designated by some of her friends as the ""un-datable"" by her unique personality. Yet, there is some charisma in her, her relentless to pursue her dream, her perkiness and her sense of humor throughout the entire film was a very positive performance from Gerwig.The film is very centric around the protagonist Frances in the film, depicting a girl who spurned to make any compromise to the world and gradually have to face the fact that the world doesn't revolve around her. Another key element in the film is the friendship between Frances and Sophie which they had an intriguing yet peculiar friendship for audience to spectate.This would be the film you love if you want any indie, non-blockbuster yet artistic films. I personally love the soundtrack which blends in seamlessly as the movie progresses. The indie music injects the energy in the inner realm of Frances's world. It's also a great move for Noah Baumbach to film the entire movie in monochrome which even makes this film even more unique.",Frances Ha

I am a not-so-easily-amused-boomer looking for a punch line from the Millennia's. They toss the lines out fast, frequent, and occasionally some are humorous. A younger man sitting behind me ""LOL'd"" more than I, but I am okay with it. Frances Ha grabbed hold of me as it whisked by and never let me go. Greta is Greta and that is great. The cinematography at some points is so good that I felt like I was looking at a still photograph in a classy gallery. You might read reviews where comparisons are drawn of Diane Keaton, Woody Allen, Lucy & Ethel,etcetera, etcetera. Noah and Greta have made a modern masterpiece that speaks the language of 2013. Lets credit their art-making rather than explain it as an extension from the past. ""Frances Ha"" is a classic even though no one clubs you over the head in order to drum up the fact that you are watching a classic. It quietly goes about it's business of entertaining the audience. I admit that I came into the movie with some preconceived baggage. I groaned at the thought of another David Bowie song making another statement in yet another movie. Truth is that the song fit in a very amusing scene. In 2007, I met Greta while she was stumping ""Hannah Takes the Stairs"" at the Maryland Film Festival with director Joe Swanberg. I was a driver for the festival who hustled the directors/actors/screeners from the airport to the festival and vice versa. I picked up Greta and her New York posse at the train station, in a 10 passenger van. This was really funny since the train station is next door to the film festival. It took much more time to herd them into the van than the 30 second commute. Greta got the joke and I caught a glimpse of the character, Frances six years ago.P.S.

In my opinion, this is a film about superficiality and denial. (It's maybe even IN denial).I guessed, from having seen The Squid and the Whale (2005) that this new film by the same director would probably be a 'gentle' affair. However, while the former had some tension, and some tension-bursting scenes, Frances Ha, in contrast, is an hour and a half (or so) of monotony.Some of the time it comes across like an indulgent Dogme film advertising bit after bit of boring life packed with meaningless characters; some of the time it's like a Woody Allen film from the seventies that never takes off; there's one scene in a college party where the film almost descends into farce, and i so hoped it would just elevate itself in any way, but it didn't and i was disappointed.Clearly a low budget movie that tries hard to avoid clichés and yet is choc-a-bloc full of them: the dopy effete score (apart from the odd hit from the 70's), the dopy superficial friendships, weak attempts at humour.Sorry, but it's not a comedy, it's a drama with some whimsical but everyday people.

At first the black and white distracted me a bit, but that faded soon. The main character is a clumsy young woman in her 20ies. Her character reminds me of something like a female young Woody Allen. The monochrome picture supports that reminiscence on Wood Allen films for me. But the film plays in our time and is very much up to date in my opinion. The other main character is Frances Ha's best friend. Main theme in this movie is friendship. Friendship meaning your best friend who could maybe be the most important person in ones life, at least in Frances Ha's life. The happenings in this movie seem so realistic i wondered if it was a semi-documentary or something like this. This is just like real life. Someone here said there is no really storyline in this movie, but I think it has as much a storyline as real life has...or has not. What life makes of your dreams and hopes when you try to give your best to achieve them makes for some kind of Happy End here. I would recommend that movie for fans of Woody Allen and New York. Go watch it with your best friend.",Frances Ha
133,ericm4,"well worth watching, but flawed",8,28 February 2014,"This film explores the ways people fit themselves into social roles. The main character, oblivious of them, but with sincere feeling for life and others, ends up failing to read subtle cues within multiple spheres: work/networking, love, and friendship. The film looks indirectly at the elephant in the room in the arts: that everyone is actually quite weird, unique, and of value, but hide themselves behind multiple fronts out of fear, insecurity, and self-defense. At the same time, they often fail to appreciate the value of others due to ready-made assessments of their fitness to belong within a certain sphere. Sometimes a person is left behind because their resume/looks/social connections/aesthetic/whatever won't fit into that next rung of the social or career ladder. I suppose this process happens both in romance and work.It's beautifully shot, and mostly well written, overall very enjoyable and worth taking the time to watch when the majority of films, even indie ones, are so poorly written and executed. In Greta Gerwig's lead character, I sense a little Diane Keaton circa Annie Hall or Manhattan. Not the first to say so, but it's there in a wonderful way, though I don't think this film quite accomplishes what those films did. And here is the difference - Woody Allen didn't have happy endings.My main critique is this Frances Ha's sugary-sweet ending. Every character returns for a final reunion at the end. It is heavy handed and negates the real sadness that would be more true to reality - that too often people are not permanent parts of one's life, and must make their exit never to return, no matter how much we wish they would stay, no matter how wrong or right their reasons may be. We can't cling.",Frances Ha

136,filmflamfilm,Simply dreadful,4,2 January 2015,"Having read the good reviews, I was quite prepared to enjoy this film. However, after a short time, I realised that I would not be enjoying the film.Although it is a drama, it might be seen as the diary of Frances, the main character. We learn a lot about her fairly quickly. What I learned fairly quickly was that I didn't particularly like her and didn't think very much of her. She is clearly confused about her situation in life. She is in her late 20s. One would expect that by that age, life would no longer be so confusing.By the midpoint of the film, Frances became really quite irritating. Her life was difficult for me to relate to or to even understand. If the film had been about a group of friends, hopefully a bit brighter than Frances, perhaps there would be something. But this is not a film I could recommend unless you are perhaps in the same situation as Frances.Admittedly it is not a big Hollywood production, but that does not automatically make it good.",Frances Ha

Perhaps when you grow up you will appreciate Sex in the City. Also watch if you are a bona fide hipster. This black and white film is truly colorless and one dimensional. It may appear original if you have never seen a Woody Allen film but still falls flat. I prefer films with characters who express an opinion. The main characters of this film profess to have an opinion but really never express anything in particular. It reminds me of exactly what Woody Allen focuses on, complains about but ultimately, Allen's films rise above the fail whereas this film only supposes or claims it has. Unfortunately, through the hype and critical support it has received, Frances Ha's only achievement is to demonstrate that there is no soul or ""magic"" in the life of young adult, privileged class hipsters.",Frances Ha
138,estella2,A Time Capsule of the current 'Echo Boomer' culture,10,25 February 2014,"Frances is the kind of girl who was brought up by baby boomers. In case you aren't familiar with baby boomer parenting: (this is based on personal experience) baby boomers usually are the kind of parents that would tell you that you could be or do anything you ever wanted as a career 'as long as you set your mind to it' (think of the ending of 'Back to the Future'). So Frances probably tried to do everything and switched like 5 different career goals and then probably after watching 'Flashdance' for the first time she decided she wanted to be like Jennifer Beals character and be a dancer in a professional dance company. So her parents probably encouraged her to be a dancer...even though she was a mediocre dancer.And so, because no one ever bothered to tell her this sad truth, she finds herself at 27 STILL not invited into the Dance Company that she has been apprenticing at for years. It then finally dawns on her that she isn't fit to be a professional dancer. Because Frances doesn't want to continue as a receptionist, the only job that is eventually offered to her at the dance company, she quits and joins the many disillusioned unemployed 20-somethings that roam the many late night loft parties of New York.It then gets worse when her bestfriend/roommate decides to grow up and get married. Now she is really alone and confused. I wont spoil the rest for those haven't seen it yet, but I will say that in the end Frances manages to find her true passion, as well as the missing letters from her last name 'Frances Ha------'.I will warn you that some might leave this film feeling a bit melancholy. I actually saw this movie two times and on the third time it left me sort of depressed and wanting to get drunk.",Frances Ha

140,moviedump,One for the parents.,7,2 October 2013,"Though brushed by Fame and with a translucent overlay of Manhattan and and its Parisian antecedents, Frances Ha seems for the most part to have spilled out of Lena Dunham's Girls-iverse, its female protagonist in an extended tragi-comic freefall toward the abyss of homelessness, of failure, of no longer being 20-something. Dialogue so dense it sounds drawn from a year living with a dictaphone is saved by editing, comic timing and star Greta Gerwig's successful negotiation of the tightrope of charm.In the end, freefalling Frances appears redeemed by a better understanding of her artistic ambitions, if not a lowering of her sights, but confronting the limits of friendship and taking advice from her elders seems to have at least as much to do with it. Frances' journey is probably about getting over dependency, but this capitulation to the parent world may be the core of what isn't quite satisfying about the film. We don't empathise with Frances and revel in her first success so much as feel relieved we don't have to worry about her anymore.",Frances Ha
141,eastwest-257-811887,Hipsters are not interesting,1,8 March 2015,"This movie I think looked on the cover of the box that might be something, to me it never got going. I made it through it however I'll tell you right now (spoiler alert) it is very painful to watch at about the 1/2 hour in mark. I almost turned it off that's how bad it was starting to get. It kind of pulls it's self together extremely loosely, but the movie doesn't work that well. It's basically about of hipster clowns who talk like idiots and have conversations of zero context and all think they are smarter then they really are. Any normal person on the street would go ""Do you hear how these young kids talk to each other these days and what they talk about? They sound like a bunch of idiots and they talk like a bunch of idiots."" I am part of the ""millennial generation"" but I am in no way shape or form any part of this goofy hipster movement I don't go near these people.This girl Greta Gerwig she's kind of pretty and I think might be fun to go on a date with I think she's mildly attractive and she does seem fun, however her character in this movie blows. Her as a dancer doesn't work at all. I don't know if that's what the director and the writers were going for, but she's way to manish to pass off as a dancer and she's way to obsessed with her friend Sophie who by the way is to me useless in this film. The friend Sophie her character is nothing and you know this whole movie kind of stunk. It was just stuck in neutral the whole time.The part (spoiler alert) where she traveled to Paris was pretty much worthless don't really know what that proved, besides she was just acting like a poseur. I mean really these characters in this mover were really all just a bunch of poseurs. I didn't much care for any of them and there is a fringe group that does live like this, but it's just that a fringe group. I didn't think this movie was anything great.

143,Meatdawg,I wanted to like this film.,1,7 July 2013,"Warning this review does contain spoilers! I really wanted to like ""Frances Ha"": after all it is an independent movie, right? Anymore, I wonder what kind of weight the term ""independent"" carries at least in the realm of movie-dom. This was the second movie that my friend and I saw that evening so we chose ""Frances"" because it seemed like lighter fair from the spy movie we saw earlier. My friend found the film mediocre at best, my criticism was much more harsh.How about a real story here. Here we have Greta Gerwig in the guise of Frances who meanders through life having aspirations of being a professional dancer but doesn't really commit herself fully to making that happen. She even turns down an office job at her dance company when she didn't make the cut for the BIG Christmas production. So, instead of keeping a job at a dance company that at least keeps her ""foot in the door"" she goes off on an aimless vacation to France in order to impress her more prosperous friends. Even Frances' ""conversations"" are mindless. She makes outrageous statements to shock her friends and acquaintances only to retract them seconds later.I could go on but in short this is a vanity movie for neophyte and wanna-be actors. Replete with show-biz nepotism; Mickey Sumner, Grace Gummer, and Charlotte D'Amboise are daughters of rock-star ""Sting"", Meryl Streep, and ballet super-star Jacques D'Amboise. Not to be outdone Greta Gerwig's own parents play her parents in the movie! There is little to recommend in watching this movie. Gerwig does have a certain ebullient charm and Mickey Sumner shows promise as Frances' friend. They both no doubt will see future roles. But the fault of this film rests with the poor directing and especially the bad writing. Like most Hollywood movies there is no real story here, just a string of gratuitous scenes by a director who at best has a lackluster track record.",Frances Ha
144,nico-hvi,"An 86-minute insight into the life of a pretentious, shallow group of people",2,8 September 2013,"I had high hopes for this movie, I really did. We ended up seeing it because Blue Jasmine wasn't showing anymore, which seemed like a natural choice since Frances Ha was being touted as a a'modern Woody Allen-movie' http://goo.gl/0sHCY2 (which in itself is a stupid classification since many of Allen's movies are timeless, but whatever).What I expected was a thoughtful display into the inner life of an interesting person dealing with existential dilemmas (who am I when I'm all alone? How do my friends define me? How can I decide on which values in life broaden rather than cheapen it?), but instead found a group of pretentious people talking past each other. Seriously, I couldn't find a single honest conversation in this entire movie, which sort of ruins the whole emphasis on dialogue. By 'honest' conversation I mean the actual investment of feeling into the words coming out of the mouths of the people maintaining the conversation, a good example of the opposite is this:""You're my best friend""""Totally""""I'm moving out""""I can't get this ring off of my finger""Which is more or less taken directly out of a scene on the subway in Frances Ha. People might say this movie is 'quirky', 'fun' and 'well-written', and it might have some trace of all those characteristics, but in the end (for me, anyway) none of that matters when there isn't a trace of honesty left - who would want to watch a shallow, uninteresting, self-centered person experience random stuff for 1 hour and 24 minutes?",Frances Ha
145,scAlIbLe,Greta Gerwig is quietly thrilling as free-spirited Frances Ha.,7,31 July 2013,"Frances Ha is the kind of film that lingers long after it's over and follows you home. In all its loveliness, Frances Ha invites us to question how we live our lives, accept that it's OK to run in circles until we find ourselves; and for the more artistically inclined write our own scripts.Fresh, crisp, and very French, Frances Ha does not so much inhabit the nostalgic landscape of Woody Allen's Manhattan to which it is widely compared, as look the other way. It openly revisits the French New Wave's palette of François Truffaut's The 400 Blows and the tone of Jean Eustache's meditation on love triangles in The Mother and The Whore.Little seems to happen to her. 27-year-old girl-next-door tries to make it in Manhattan. Nothing too revolutionary. When we meet Frances, she is a struggling modern dancer who has more in common with Charlie Chaplin's tumbles than Louise Lecavalier's grace. Frances' life revolves around her best friend Sophie whom she lives with like ""an old lesbian couple that doesn't have sex"". The day Sophie brightly announces that she is moving in with her boyfriend, everything suddenly comes to a crashing halt. She ends up staying with friends Lev and Benji, barely makes her reduced rent, imagines she is on the verge of success when failure looms and follows her muse on credit. There is a lightness of touch in this entire movie that makes Frances' turmoil a real delight to watch. All actors clearly revel in the material they were given. I almost wished I had been one of them! Where is the line between love and friendship, possessiveness and possession, art and commerce? Whose side are you on? Greta Gerwig delivers a subtle performance to which love, in the end, is undeniable. Mickey Sumner's Sophie and Michael Zegen's cheerful Benji fill the screen with presence whenever they appear.Go see Frances Ha for how it will make you feel. Pick a great cinema at a quiet time.

146,bunty-thoidingjam,Undateable but totally charming!,9,29 April 2014,"Undateable but totally lovable. That's what Frances Ha is. She's lanky, clumsy, awkward, handsome and charmingly unsophisticated. Frances is a struggling dancer in New York and her life is carefully dissected. Somehow in the beginning it travails her love life, her financial struggle, her separation with her friend - Sophie and falling-out-of- love life. Sophie, her best friend, moves out from their flat and suddenly her topic comes up during *dinner with folks of her new flatmate. Her small circle of friends is also an amusing one. She clumsily dances, runs like a boy and trips & forgets her wounds. Watch her as she tries to put her life together by going away to Paris for a torturous holiday or moves back to her college to earn some bucks. Listen carefully to the conversation as characters in the movie lie to each other in order to project that their lives are happier and that embarrassing truth, to which it finally doesn't matter at all. Wasted at the *dinner, she falters and speaks about what kind of relationship she is looking for and says this is probably the reason why she is single. Dialogues are just realistic as ever.Benji, one of her flatmates during the course of the movie, informs that another flatmate had told him that she and he might end up being married. So, she replies: I guess we're like a married couple in a way. We talk. We don't have sex. The script of conversations seems so unprepared and skewed but it all adds up. At the end of the movie, Benji who calls her undateable all the time congratulates her about her show. she replies: Thanks, I like things that look like mistakes. Greta Gerwig (Frances) is like Geena Davis without grace. Her name is not actually Frances Ha. But it's like that sarcastic 'Ha ha' after you've said a contradictory statement.

During the time we visit her she has her ups and downs, but she never gives up on her self or her best friend Sophie, even when she abandoned her in favor of growing up. Frances is a dancer, and not because it pays well, because it certainly doesn't in her case. She dances as a way of expressing her free spirit, of course her roommate Benji believes this is what makes Frances ""un-dateable."" Frances Ha is an undeniably charming film, it maybe be a little to ""hipster"" for it's own good at times, but it doesn't take away from the engaging story and extreme loveable performance of Gerta Gerwig (co-writer of this film).

148,samuelanthonytaunton,"""I'm not a real person yet."" - Frances Ha, Review and Analysis",8,12 July 2021,"Compared to some of Baumbach's other films, this is a really charming one. From the opening shots alone, we see a montage of living the big city life as Frances and her friend Sophie travel here and there, the best of friends. The significance of friendship itself is very reminiscent throughout and was certainly one of my takeaways from the film.In 'Frances Ha', Frances (played by Greta Gerwig) has aspirations of becoming a successful dancer and joining a renowned company, she lives with her best friend Sophie who both seem to get on like a house on fire. The reason that this film works so well is that the star of the show, Greta Gerwig, is really brilliant at playing a supposed adult who is still 'young at heart'. When watching the film, I thought the idea of age was a debate that Baumbach was really trying (and succeeding) to get across - when do we officially reach adulthood? What makes us mature? I'd say that Frances is having this constant struggle with herself as those around her seem to be maturing at a much quicker pace; getting pregnant, having relationships and more stable jobs. Frances even returns to her college at one point as a means of making money but returning to her place of childhood can show how she's still grappling with her youthful personality.This film also has some very funny moments, one being a scene where Frances attempts to pay for dinner by spanning the lengths of the 'Big Apple' to find a cash machine. Along with Baumbach's really fun soundtrack throughout, this makes for a particularly entertaining watch.The idea of friendship pops up again and again. Frances surrounds herself with similar minded people such as Lev (played by Adam Driver who has made many excellent performances in indie as well as mainstream films) and Benji. The life of these arty folks is a very cultural one, there are discussions of movie going, music, drinking, reading Proust, buying art. Money troubles are also another repeated consequence for Frances but her friends are there to help out, she even rightly describes her flat-sharing situation ""like a sitcom"" at one point. Friendship can also however come with jealousy and when Sophie becomes more attached to Patch instead of Frances, there is indeed a touch of the green-eyed monster. But Frances soon has to accept these changes in order to become a better person. And real friends that you can count on like Sophie will be there for you, even when you can't always see them. There is also a dichotomy expressed between friends and family. Most of the time our friends are our family and our family can be our friends so there is a strong link between these two.I'd say that Baumbach has been particularly inspired by the director Woody Allen who similarly has motifs of troubling relationships between friends and family throughout his films, with dialogue that is filled with cultural references and whether in places like New York we can make a name for ourselves. 'Frances Ha' even has a similar black and white aesthetic to Manhattan.The ending of the film is really exuberant and heart-warming, Frances has finally found her way into the world of dance as a living but a slightly different one. At the end of her choreographed performance, she looks over at Sophie - ""That's Sophie, she's my best friend"". We find that Frances has adapted to the changes in her life and has held on to one of the most important things that we all seek to retain. Friendship.",Frances Ha
149,zolazona,I Loved Frances-I Have Never Seen A Character Like her,8,2 December 2013,"I liked this modern US version of a New Wave movie...the black and white intimacy of the film using very few characters, with people who moved around in different apartments and cities (New York, Sacramento(!) and Paris). The intimacy of the scenes made me feel as though I was right there inside the same rooms, listening to real people talk.I grew very fond of the Frances character. She did galumph around like a man but she managed to reveal grace and in some shots her face was poignantly beautiful. I felt her loneliness and awkwardness, and cringed during the dinner scene. I grew so embarrassed that I kept looking away from the screen a few times , but later when she had that little moment trying to articulate her feelings about being with someone that you love in a crowded room, my heart soared for her. Even though you still felt the other characters thought she was odd, they were all listening intently to her. And her running and dancing down the street!

There is a certain vibe... It's nostalgic, realistic, honest, and messy. But these are all the things that make this a great movie. I caught this film on tv one afternoon and was struck by how relatable it was. These characters are people I know and associate with regularly. It was scary how realistic it was; had to make my wife watch it with me.
Most movies paint these types of characters as these whimsical cool kids who live these lives that are anything but further from reality. Although if you were some kid living in Ohio or Nebraska you might think that is how young (dare I say hipster?!) adults live. Being from this area I can say how untrue that stereotype is.
The people in this movie aren't perfect. They're deep thinkers, hopelessly exaggerated personality, living the struggle of trying to live in an over saturated, expensive area; or at the least trying to be these things but are padded by their privilege.
But then there is Frances, who is a mess and has no clue how to be anything other than that. At times she frustrating to watch and other times you sympathize because she is so lost. It's when she finally becomes an independent ""adult"" that you feel so much pride in her.

157,sweetpeasonthepods,Hated it-spoilers,1,31 August 2020,"There is so much wrong in this film I'm not sure where to begin.Some filmmakers think that shooting in black and white instantly gives their film gravitas. This is not true. I found the use of b&w distracting and detrimental. It showcased the amateur qualities and attempt at instant hipster cred. Fail.In no way is this film New Wave. New Wave looked to disrupt traditional narrative and offer insight, mood, character study, or sense of place. This movie is lazy, lacking any story, insight, or charm.Gerwig's character as a dancer is a joke at best, offensive at worst. They are so far off the target of a dancer's life which must include incredibly hard physical work, determination, sacrifice, a bit of neuroticism, perfectionism, dedication, and single-mindedness. Gerwig is an awkward, ungainly, inelegant, tall, graceless oaf. These are not the qualities of a dancer. Dancers' postures are impeccable, if not even exaggerated. Gerwig clomps around like an overweight truck driver. She is the antithesis of a dancer, yet her dullard friends oh and ah at her wholly embarrassing attempt to demonstrate a dance move (soooo cringeworthy!).Nothing happens in this movie. Why should we care about any of the characters? What are their redeeming qualities? Answer: there are none.It makes no sense that Gerwig's character is given so many passes after committing so many social gaffes. Self-absorption, vapidness, boring drivel disguised as conversation, lack of direction, lack of interests do not make one quirky.This movie is not funny; this movie does not offer any insights or new perspective. Can we please stop with the ""broke"" young New Yorkers living in huge, charming apartments! As someone who did live in the lower East side and was broke--this is not how it happens! It would be a thousand times more interesting if just the true struggle to find living in NYC were explored. But nope, no struggle and an endless supply of couches or bedrooms save the day for Frances, again and again.I didn't realize the cast contains several offspring of famous people. This makes a lot of sense. Initially I gave small credit in casting female actresses who skirt the line of traditional female beauty. In finding out these were privileged, connected children of famous parents-even this small credit gets thrown out. It doesn't help that two of these women even look a bit alike. I was confused at some points because I thought they were the same actress! Not smart to cast similarly looking actresses for throwaway parts.I've learned a very valuable lesson here: when a movie is terrible, just turn it off. Don't wait for redeeming qualities nor redemption in a third act. You'll find none of it here, that's for sure.This is the type of movie that annoyed me so much, it is difficult to write a cogent review.

158,commandx2000,Baumbach and Gerwig kick down open doors,1,24 January 2016,"Entitled. Mean-spirited. Lazy. There's a French saying about lazy artists picking easy targets.. It's known as 'kicking down open doors.' That's exactly what Frances Ha does. Nothing to see here unless you're young and wealthy in NYC and, somehow, still feel you need vindication. In which case, come right in and make yourself at home. Sorry, but in my book, everything is politics and this movie specifically invites the type of criticism I am making here.Unfortunately, the ruling class in this country has such a stranglehold on the 'art-world'that a self-indulgent piece of garbage like this will, rather than meet with criticism, get raves from the kind of cozy intellectual mainstream that, like blue-bloods throughout history, looks down on labor and working for a living.This is tired stuff, folks. These sentiments were exciting when the beat generation- a generation which actually struggled for their art- exulted in them in the 50s. To imply that one can transpose those same power-elite tangents to spoiled rich kids in NYC in 2016 is just insulting.I'm not a fan of the Men's Rights movement either, but this movie takes Mansploitation to a new level. Frances Ha actually managed to make me feel sorry for a Wall Street broker bro. Jesus. What an accomplishment. Why? Because I have some humanity and these characters are all about dehumanizing the 'other' and those who are not like them. Why not tie Patch down and crap down his throat while you're at it?I am far from anti-intellectual, but I do consider myself a bit too far to the left in my politics to relate to the facile rich-kid uber domination of the arts that has become the norm in today's America -and is lovingly represented in Frances Ha. Watching this movie, I kept wishing the guillotine would come back in vogue.",Frances Ha
159,stancube,A fun examination of the human condition via a slice of Frances' life.,10,5 September 2012,"Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig lead us on an expansive journey that takes place in the confines of several years in the life of a single character - Frances. They co-wrote the film and Gerwig is sublimely engaging as Frances, a woman who prefers to focus on the moments along life's path rather than any sort of destination to the path itself.Baumbach takes those incredibly realistic and often uncomfortable moments, shapes them into black-and-white vignettes that are both immediate and personal, and then precisely combines those vignettes into this delicate and funny film. It's rounded off by an unbelievably talented supporting cast who make ""Frances Ha"" an all-around joy to watch.",Frances Ha
160,LadiesAndMovies,This is one sad sad movie,6,27 February 2014,"One of my closest friends raved about this movie and said . On paper it sounded amazing: co- written and starring Greta Gerwig, with a focus on a non-perfect struggling 28 year old and her female friendships. So a female driven movie with some help from Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Margot at the Wedding, etc.), perfect. So my friend and me watched it after she'd borrowed it from a 50 year old co-worker (who just loved it) and it was just - underwhelming. The most obvious issue was that we were both expecting a quirky-Woody-Allen-NY-comedy, a bit like Girls, but smarter and more mature, and this movie is just so sad. Cringe worthy and pathetic sad. I'm not saying it's not relatable. In fact I think that's part of the problem. The reason my well employed friend or the 50 year old co- worker might have enjoyed it more is that they had some considerable distance to being confused about life and never taking the right decisions. For me the constant stress of not knowing where to live, of not knowing what you should do for a living, of losing friends to adulthood is just all to fresh and close to be enjoyable and/or nostalgic. The movie does have things going for it - it does have a very strong focus on female friendship. The last scene especially says something very beautiful about the strength of having close friends. But for me that was too little too late. It's also nice that the movie doesn't judge the protagonist for being a failure in the eyes of society, it treats her with respect and shows her just as she is with all her awkward monologues at parties and neediness. With all those fresh and important elements I just wish the execution felt more palpable to me at the moment. Some reviewers have pointed to the lack of drive and the lack of conflict in the movie as problematic, and at the moment I have to agree, I think the movie so focused on being lost would have been easier to watch if there were some more distractions on screen. Perhaps in 20-30 years I'll think differently.",Frances Ha
161,quita2627,quirky dramedy,7,1 December 2014,"this is a quirky coming-of-age (albeit late in age) dramedy that has a love story of best friends squished in it. i love the black and white screening metaphor to the main character which is, I paraphrase, that ""she appears much older than she is"". The new york hipsters in this movie can be a bit cringe worthy, but tolerable because the main character, although wanting to be thought of in that light, is definitely not one of them! she's not hip or cool, but she is artistic in a more genuine way in that she isn't self-ware of it. I watched this one alone last night, but you should definitely grab your best gal pal(s) and watch this one! BTW, this indie has an actual ending! Now isn't that nice.",Frances Ha
162,scaryfilm2,Utter sh#t from well connected brats,1,19 November 2021,"Frances is an ""apprentice"" dancer - which is hard to believe since she is very ungainly. Apart from ""dancing"" she never worked a real job in her life. Frances shares an apartment with BFF Sophie, in a sort of a ""celibate"" lesbian relationship (at least, from Frances' side).Both girls have boyfriends, but Frances has no problem with dispassionately dumping hers, when he proposes she moves in with him. Unfortunately for Frances, Sophie actually moves in with her man, Patch. Frances, feeling hurt and betrayed (additional strong lesbian vibes) cannot pay rent and moves in with another couple of slackers. Then she gets ""temporarily"" sacked from the dance company she works for and ""sort of"" runs out of money.This does not stop her from flying to Paris for a weekend and from refusing a job as a ""mere"" accountant, which would not fulfill her artistic delusions. She meets with Sophie and Patch and comes to terms with them getting married. In the end, Frances accepts the ""normal"" job and moves into her own apartment, while maintaining her status as ""undateable"".Shot in black & white, by director Baunbach, the movie tries and fails miserably to look like a mix of French nouvelle vague (specifically Jules & Jim) and early Woody Allen (specifically Manhattan).Gerwig plays Frances as a lethargic young woman, lacking elegance and discipline, which presumably are needed for such a competitive and physical profession. Sophie is played by one of Sting's children and one of Streep's daughters plays another dancer, completing the cast of VIPs. Neither shines, but I guess being mediocre actresses will not hurt their careers.Baumbach and Gerwig were (still are? Really don't care) a couple during the filming. Actress/director relationships usually produce mediocre movies, and this is just another one to add to the list.",Frances Ha

However, some years later and some maturity earned, I could embrace the aspects that makes this film, a great one. The fast paced, black and white aesthetics and dialogues made me love it. All delicacy on details, symbolism and sensitivity... How we watch the protagonist grow into her own individual while building relationships made honest and raw. I like how in the dialogues the characters could speak they minds and, mostly, being accepting and no judgmental. Well, in the end was a well spent time.",Frances Ha
164,betoramonadv,"""I'm not a real person yet"", she said.",7,14 November 2015,"This beautiful mumblecore is the typical story of growth and denial. The film tells Frances' story. An aspiring dancer in her late twenties, who looks for her path to maturity in the New York jungle.The film was shot in black/white, perhaps as an attempt to recreate La Nouvelle Vague, so we cannot talk about cromatism itself, but it actually has some nice planes, as the very first one, who irradiates the beauty of youth. However, the core and climax of the story can be traced on the quote said by Frances, having lunch with her new roommate and friends: ""Sometimes it's good to do what you're supposed to do, when you're supposed to do it."" This phrase is true. She was right, but she didn't understand it then. In most part of the movie she's trying to avoid that sentence. She cannot understand that she needs to take some responsibility, to start building her life brick by brick. She represents everything young adults are today. They want everything right now and with less effort. But they're in a boggy path too, they're fragile and still naive. They're crossing the street between childhood and maturity, as she did in one of those iconic planes in the film. And that's not a easy job, to be honest.In addition, the quote shows that she was struggling with herself, when she could just let things happen and 'go with the flow'. ""I'm not a real person yet"", she confessed. She was confused and a little sad because all of her friends and acquaintances were kind of fine, stable and, probably, with a well-known future, while she was fighting just to keep a stable place to live. This happen to all of us sometime. Not in the same way, but the same topic. There are moments when you feel that everyone is doing it better than you so you get a little mad with yourself. I think Baumbach was trying to show how things will be alright if you just do what you're supposed to do, when you have to, albeit, it's important to point out this is not always true. To finish, I'd say it's not about being conformist, but realistic. When she understood that, she was happy.Well done, Noah. A simple film with a simple story well developed, integrally. The photography is okay, the script is fine (nothing pretentious), and the acting is fresh and natural, kind of ""no-totally-actors"", but I enjoy it, somehow, so... 7,5/10.",Frances Ha

167,lahninanwar,Something strange yet moving,8,3 September 2019,"When I first saw this movie I knew a little of what to expect, but not completely, obviously. By being shot in black and white it gave it a late 1950's quality, and you hardly ever actually saw the tall buildings that sort of make New York City. Another thing about the shots is that they were quite stylistic , like moving poetry.
Now on to the story, it seems like the director is just trying to create moments of time that don't really come together, but when they do it's almost strange and it works on the relationships, Frances and Mickey talking on the phone and planning to go different countries, some of the connections are affected by a distanced tone. With all that being said, romantic relationships aren't the main course yet, but I rambled long enough for one trip. Overall I'd recommend it, if you're into a fuel won't be able softer feelings that you can't help my village, Mai, shu and the fox is emperor now, hahaha!",Frances Ha

169,nathanandmooney,An unlikeable lead and her boring life.,4,10 September 2020,"Frances Halladay spends 85 minutes taking turns with her friends to deliver increasingly eyerolling dialogue as she lives out their semi-relatable but ultimately unengaging life. Our protagonist battles her way through financial issues, feelings of inadequacy, and complicated interpersonal relationships, and while this makes for as adequate a premise as any, the movie doesn't portray these conflicts in any original or even interesting way. And while Frances' change and growth as a character can be felt and appreciated, it doesn't make her any less irritating. She's just annoying. She spends the entire run time acting like a rude, impulsive, and weirdly aggressive imbecile. And even if she did somehow work through these character flaws, it's never properly communicated. It didn't make her relatable, just aggravating to watch as an audience member.The technical aspects were quite impressive. Most every shot was very well composed, and the B/W palette complimented the simplicity of the narrative very well. The soundtrack served its purpose expertly.While I left this film unimpressed, the later work of both Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach is nothing short of phenomenal, and it's those pieces expanded on the better idea of this piece.",Frances Ha

Frances is so innocent, positive and little bit naive which reminded me of a kid. Like she doesn't want to see bad side of life and be realistic like a real grown up (that is why I admire her).Usually, we are used to watch romantic movies about relationships and love between a couple (man and woman) but this is something completely different and kind of liberating. It shows us some other kind of love and tells us that it can be painful and sweet too.Also, this movie reminds me of Woody Allen. B/W story with nice music, perfect for every moment.

So many short stories for example - one frame - going back from Paris, we see the plane's wing - so simple, so bright - you don't need nothing more.Sometimes we have to make compromises to achieve something, but no matter what we do, we always need our closest friends around us!

174,hangingbystrands,Loved it.,9,28 July 2013,"Ah my gawd!! It's another film about self-obsessed middle class twenty-somethings living (or struggling to live) in New York city, reluctantly having to face up to the challenges of arrested development and the loss it inevitably entails.Ah my gawd! It's shot in black and white,a reference to French New Wave Cinema, one might assume!! The characters are laconic, adorably hop and purely self-involved. They have quirky (read: child-like) behavioural characteristics that are often played for comic effect. Our protagonist Frances has to face huge issues like her best friend from high school moving into a new apartment on Tribeca St, while she has to settle one she can barely afford in Chinatown. Suddenly the blissfully unaware shell the once inhabited is shattered open and a series of consequences seem to follow in its wake.By all rights, I should actively despise this film. It's a theme, story and context which has been done to death and in this day and age a lot of people like to react violently towards such ideas. After all, what real problems could a young white female who isn't exactly poor have to face? Unfortunately, and to the utter dismay of the angry old man inside of me, I absolutely loved this film.You might think it would be hard for me to distinguish exactly why this film is so much better than so many other comparable films. On a purely cinematic level, this film is captured expertly. The black and white is beautiful and lends a romantic, nostalgic tone to the film's ambiance. The scenes are shot simply, often with still camera work but they are effective and convey our protagonists' nonchalance. The dialogue and characterization is impressively real. Who would have considered, for instance, that in real life people don't always hear or interpret each other perfectly? Who would have considered that a bunch of hipsters in their late 20s in New York, despite the bravado are a long way from being as cool as they think they are? The acting is nearly pitch perfect and the story is told in a balanced manner which lends equal perspective to the joys and pains of Frances' life But it's not necessarily these qualities that make this film really stand out for me. What sets Frances Ha apart, in my opinion, is a little wisdom and experience.Noah Baumbach after all, is no longer a youth himself. Many of the qualities I just described about this film, especially the social awkwardness and general quirkiness of the characters, is far from being original. The obvious comparison of Lena Dunham springs to mind. The real difference is that Mr Baumbach seems to have a slightly more enlightened perspective on this slightly wayward twenty-something's life and the often bad decisions she makes. It seems to be a prevailing trend that most films with this kind of story and context like to take a somewhat downbeat approach. This can often feel contrived and insubstantial coming from younger writers and directors and the fact that Frances Ha looks like it's going take no exception to this rule until the last few minutes had me writing it off before it was over.But the surprisingly gentle ending is exactly what makes this film so special, in my opinion. Nothing in this movie is made out to be perfect. Even the friendship between Frances and her best friend is more fragile than the two of them would like to believe.Their fall out is believable and Frances' drunken, juvenile outburst is painfully sincere. Frances' child-like aura has a lot of self-destructive qualities. She is indolent, self-obsessed, and her often child-like behaviour crosses the line into the fatuous and annoying more than a few times. In spite of that, Frances is endearingly awkward, resolutely determined to succeed in a profession she simply doesn't have the talent for and is ultimately a well-intentioned and wholesome character who proves to have a surprising amount of perseverance. I can understand why some audience members might not love her, but if you can't find a little space for her in your heart I kind of question what temperature your blood runs at. The ending does not make it out that life is going to be perfect from there on in. In fact, there's no point at which the film edges towards easy answers or resolutions. I feel that this is a film which isn't afraid to show how it can be tempting to succumb to cynicism during one's youth but it's always better not to.I found I could relate to this film very closely. It was funny, quietly profound and really quite beautiful.But I can understand why everyone isn't going to like Frances Ha. I was nearly one of them.",Frances Ha

This was the first time I've seen Ms. Gerwig in anything, and I will seek out her earlier movies and look forward to her future work as a writer and actress. The movie reminded me of the HBO show ""Girls,"" and not just because Adam Driver is in it. Perhaps Greta G. and Lena Dunham can collaborate on something in the future. The struggles of young people can be made interesting, and unfortunately much of it continues when we are older. I liked the b&w cinematography.

176,ibarradj,I saw this movie before and it was called Girls,2,27 May 2013,"This is my first review on IMDb and I felt compelled to write this because I was so disappointed. The movie had very good reviews and was sold out when it played at the San Francisco International Film Festival last month. I was ecstatic to discover that the movie would open in wide distribution this month. I was particularly drawn to the black and white movie poster of Greta Gerwig dancing in Central Park. This evoked a memory of the French New Wave cinema, of which I am a fan.Unfortunately, as I sat in the theater, the movie played out as a rehash of the HBO series Girls. Mid-20s fine arts graduate trying to figure out her life while broke in Brooklyn-check. Best friend and intellectual soul mate who sells out her values to marry a rich guy-check. Adam Driver appearance-check.I am too old to know if this movie really represents today's younger generation. I do know that the movie didn't have much in the way of story. It was more of a girl aimlessly living for a fantasy but without the dedication to make her dreams come true, just like Girls.The last time I saw a movie about a dancer living in Brooklyn, it was called Saturday Night Fever. At least then, the music was catchy, the dancing compelling and the protagonist made a decision to change his life and commit to pursuing his dream.I know there are only so many story plots you can use in a movie (don't get me started on the numerous amount of struggling singers/bands that become famous or black pilots/football players/swimmers, etc that overcome prejudice movies), but this movie coming so quickly on the heels of the recent accolade Girls has received, made it feel just too familiar for this reviewer.",Frances Ha

Frances' best friend outgrows her, and everyone else in her life is moving on and growing up while she seems to be stuck in perpetual immaturity. In the end she appears to accept reality...or has she been crushed by it? In this respect it reminded me of the French film The Dream Life of Angels. If all that makes it sound too heavy going, let me reassure you that this is a film full of charm and humour, much of it springing from the performance of Greta Gerwig, who I think is in every shot. In this respect it can be seen as a love letter from the director to his partner and star, but one where Cupid's arrows are uncomfortably barbed.",Frances Ha

Depressing to see that much youth and beauty be that dull and boring. And the concept was not at all anything new. Which is what I found the most annoying aspect to it all. I saw Slackers back when I was one. I've seen every Woody Allen, made, I saw all french film back in the day's when they weren't vintage and liked King Of Hearts so much that I bought the soundtrack on vinyl when I was in elementary school.So...I was pretty disgusted that the director took other filmmaker's ideas (with more originality and artistry) and tossed those into his ""Frances Ha"" soup and hoped it might pass as something new. I believe there is a word for this?....What is it?...Oh, yeah. ""Derivative."" Frances Ha is derivative of a lot. And lacks unique wings of it's own. Sorry. It doesn't.Main character was a 27 yr old nitwit w/out enough braincells to inflate the leaden balloon the narrative already was = a sad, pointless ramble about a kid who kind of gets her act together enough to complete something involving ""real art skills"" while shuffling papers at a dance studio with a diminishing degree of self loathing by the end. That was so amazing. Audience was supposed to be charmed by her ""nutty"" approach to logic. Director stole music soundtrack to King of Hearts (1960's) and played it over and over hoping the music's wacky charm would make his flick appear ""more whimsical."" Fail. On the plus side: You get to watch Meryl Streep's daughter say ""Where the F___ are you going?"" -- That was awesome!Seriously. Blech. Very similar to ""Girls"" but sans humor or wit. At all.

""Black and white? Really?"" ""Didn't Woody Allen already do this in 'Manhattan'?""I was quickly dispelled of my prejudgments as the movie is a marvel. Thoughtfully directed, smartly written and with fantastic performances, the film is both familiar and novel. It's familiar in that we've all had to reconcile our ambitions of youth with the realities of adulthood and it's novel because the story is told with refreshing honesty.But most of all, it's entertaining. There are moments of hilarity that only work as visual jokes. The filmmakers took full advantage of the medium despite their financial limitations. The brilliant montage set to Hot Chocolate's ""Every 1's a Winner"" is what inspired me to write this review.One could easily dismiss the movie as elitist white-people problems, but the themes are universal.

Noah transcends that here, aiming for the gut with a machine gun and jamming more into 86 minutes than lesser filmmakers dream of packing into their careers. This is his funniest and most intensely intimate work yet. Gerwig explodes ebulliently on repeat as Frances. She's on another plane of consciousness.

It's that feeling where you sit and imagine where you'll be in 10 years. You see yourself and how safe and successful you are. It's different than how you imagined yourself at 35 when you were 15 but that's okay because dreams change and feelings evolve and suddenly you're in it – and I mean the days are going by so quickly that you wonder how you could possible catch up and breath but some how in some strange dimension you feel something, something real – immaculate comprehension – that's what I want.So then there you are – figuring out if what you're feeling is love, intimacy, or just a self-loathing need to have your narcissistic fantasies lived out.Okay so you're 8 years old and you're really beginning to perceive what your parent's lives are like. How they feel when they leave for work – even more how they feel when they return. What is it that they do and how they got there.

189,thegoodsamaritanproducti,If Woody Allen made an insincere movie dabbled into French New Wave...,6,11 November 2013,"Frances Ha is about a neurotic relationship between two independent women approaching their 30s, their friendship, jealousy, their place in the upper class bourgeois art town New York. It is shot in high Contrast black and white primarily made to look and remind you of Woody Allen's MANHATTAN blended with a bunch of French Nouvelle Vague references in the form of Francois Truffaut and Serge Gainsbourg. Howard Hawks once said that to make a good film you need ""3 great scenes and no bad ones."" While Frances Ha definitely had at least three great scenes, it had plenty bad ones too. The movie begins with a shot of Greta Gerwig and Micky Sumner girly play fighting and then Greta nerdy dancing to the camera while Micky plays the banjo and then chasing each other to the underground/subway station. While that scene would not be out of place and be even enjoyable in a 20 million dollar Julia Roberts rom com, here it just gives way to a sort of inconsistency that goes on to define the next 85 Min's. This film is Italian neorealist in one scene, a Jean luc Godard style preaching in the next and from there on it switches between Baumbach's own mumblecorism and Woody Allen in his ANNIE HALL, MANHATTAN phase. I am certainly an admirer of Greta Gerwig from her mumble core films and absolutely loved GREENBERG which was also with Noah Baumbach but both the director and his muse in this case overcooks the execution of what is a simple yet riveting plot. I felt like I was watching a Steven Spielberg movie like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where the first and final scene of the old surviving Ryan at the cemetery is just a dishonest attempt at manipulating the audience's emotion and making a few extra quid at the box office, Same as the Eric Bana sex scene in MUNICH. Frances Ha has been trying hard to convince you that it is NOT an art film although directed by an art director and cast accordingly. I think these same team is capable of producing better films as I am sure they will as for Greta Gerwig she needs to have more confidence in herself and realise that over dramatizing an autobiographical role especially when she is playing herself, can get messy and over the top. In this case it didn't work for me, Greta squeezes the life out of her nerdyness and that's saying a lot! Some of the very real moments like Greta being subtly reminded of her discounted rent agreement, being undateable and lacking culture or bourgeoisieness reminded me of real life situations and people I have met who I have found vulnerable in a similar way. The fact that we have a movie with women having good central parts, written by a female screenwriter is already half the battle won and hence for all the dips and misses I'd still give it a good 6. If you did not like the Man of Steel or are not waiting for the next Toy Story chances are that you might actually enjoy this film... just to an extent.",Frances Ha
190,bobdqo,An engaging story of when two college friends begin to grow in different directions.,10,30 September 2012,"I loved this movie. It was touching movie dealing with trying to become a more responsible adult without losing your sense of who you are. It also deals well with the importance of meaningful relationships in our lives. What Woody Allen did in his homage to Manhattan in the 20th century, Noah Baumbach does for Brooklyn in the 21st Century. Like Manhattan did trying to capture the spirit of New York City in the 1970s, Frances Ha captures the angst of this period focusing on singles living in Brooklyn. The engaging character of Frances also draws comparisons to Annie Hall. There are some elements in the film that brought back memories of the film Stranger than Paradise by Jim Jarmusch but this film comes across as funnier and more engaging.",Frances Ha
191,cheesescrazyfriend,"Charming but perhaps, a little too much",8,7 January 2014,"Having watched the film, I was immediately impressed by how ""cozy"" it felt with its indie home movie style and feel-good, albeit slightly generic soundtrack. All in all, it's solid and feels genuine, which is entirely commendable. However, I can agree that the film really doesn't expand upon the Coming of Age formula and gets a little caught up in being as charming and demographic baiting as possible. Nothing in the film really feels particularly relevant, and the plot chugs along at a comfortable pace towards an ending where little has changed in terms of plot. This, it seems, is the main criticism of the film.And yet, this immaturity and juvenile optimism, to me, is the heart and soul of the film. The two lead actresses Greta Gerwig and Mickey Sumner present an entirely believable and authentic insight into the struggle of two naïve yet incredibly vibrant 27 year old protagonists reaching the most crucial and daunting point in their so-far lives. They struggle with in many of our opinions, small issues, and yet, they are very real and imminent hurdles to overcome for the protagonists. The film simply documents their small personal victories and mistakes as they learn, grow, and mature. And that's it. It doesn't pretend to offer a profound insight into the grand nature of humanity's struggle to survive, nor does it need to. What baffles me is why so many critics attempt to treat it as such. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie despite its apparent ""immaturity"", and it's definitely a heartfelt film by Noah Baumbach that feels almost slightly autobiographical. All in all, it's a film that achieves what it sets out to do incredibly well, no more and no less. It's not perfect but I left the theater satisfied and overall, impressed.",Frances Ha
192,abrahao-luiza,"Good, but not great",6,22 January 2014,"Frances is that kind of character the viewer tend to get attached to. She has problems putting her life together - like the great majority of young adults -, problems with her relationships – like the great majority of young adults, and problems about her self-esteem, about the person she wants to be, again, like the great majority of young adults. Despite of that, her life and relationships are portrayed in such a superficial way I couldn't fall in love with her. Most people would say that this ""superficiality"" is the exact objective of the title, but, for me, Frances has so many layers about her personality that I wished it was better explored. However, I must admit the relationship between Frances and Sophie, portrayed as the main theme of the film, had a brilliant outcome at the end, with Sophie revealing her non Utopian perspective about it, unlike Fraces, that had always idealized their friendship. Also, despite Greta Gerwig is a good actress, my impression is that I've already seen that movie and that character she's playing – most precisely at ""Lola Versus"", her previous movie.",Frances Ha
193,kiss_trigger-570-471334,"""Francis Ha"" Is Nothing To Laugh About",1,6 May 2013,"Baumbach is the Bed, Bath, and Beyond of indie, his newest film resembling the tacky ten dollar pre-framed black and white photos of vague French ""bohemian"" cityscapes that you buy and hang in a dirty insurance office's bathroom to distract you from the smell and the crack in the wall. Films whose ""bitter, angry characters"" are stick-figure caricatures embodied by actors neither complex or talented enough to make their character's bitterness or anger anything deeper than a mere external affectation, directed by a clever hipster con artist hiding the heart of his arch conservatism.Anyone who would hire Ben Stiller (""Greenberg"") to play an embittered intellectual railing against the corporate mediocrity of modern life should be, at the very least, highly suspect. Gerwig now stands as the latest media-manufactured ""it"" girl, an unthreatening and perfectly insipid creature made-to-order for a dead and non-existent counterculture.Still, Baumbach and his muse are very necessary these days to convince an already euthanized and brainwashed Generation ZZZ that their spiritual, moral, and political malaise is a livable, ""charming"" and tolerable one, so that they can really, really forgive themselves for not roaring back like a million untamed lions against the state-sponsored execution of their hearts, minds, and souls as previous generations once did, for better or worse. In that sense, Baumbach may become the most cherished of contemporary cinematic frauds, a directorial eunuch as safe and as impotent as the audiences who flock to the flattery of his films rather than by those individuals perceptive enough to be thoroughly repulsed by them.And put aside those desperate comparisons to the French New Wave, or 70's Woody Allen. What you're seeing on screen is the rotting carcass of a nation's exhausted cinema .... pointless, empty triviality posturing as wry social observation, spewed from the wealthy pockets of a talentless hack with too many inside connections and Taschen art books piled up onto his conspicuously displayed Eames chair.",Frances Ha

Greta Gerwig does a fine job acting as Frances and portrays the malaise of young adults trying to find their way in life quite accurately, but. . .it's just not that funny, people. A comedy needs to have more laughs, and a drama needs to have more compelling characters and more action.

Perhaps it's because I've raised 4 kids who are now 23-30 that I was driven to wanting to smack her firmly upside the head throughout most of the film.If that is the end result the team was looking for, than I guess the movie DID work.I did appreciate the effort that was made to drive home the point that life is hard...confusing...surreal. I did chuckle a few times...Few.I totally enjoyed the scene of her running down the street doing her dance moves (reminded me of myself reenacting Singin' In The Rain one day while in college)...ahhhh young freedom.But the lines felt as if they were just being read aloud...The emotions felt ....canned....It felt as if I were watching the first take.

197,billanderson-729-169151,Some were charmed; I wasn't,1,3 July 2013,"Maybe I wouldn't have hated it quite so much if I were female, in my late 20s, sharing New York apartments to save money, deliriously unrealistic in my career expectations, clueless about personal relationships, unwise with money, and unable to plan beyond the moment. But I'm none of those things and thus I did indeed hate this movie. I think the filmmakers were going for some sort of modern update of a French New Wave movie in which nothing happens and every conversation is banal, trivial, no more interesting than any everyday conversation you might overhear if you were a fly on the wall who actually cared about these people, though no fly in its right mind would. Well I certainly didn't, anyway. I know I was supposed to be charmed by the good-looking-in-a-normal-everyday-way main character played by Greta Gerwig, whom I have never noticed before and expect never to notice again, but I was completely uncharmed. In fact, the only effect her helpless, hopeless, needy clinging character had on me was to make me want to run from the theater, which later, after sticking with the movie to the end while nursing an ever-dwindling hope for a story, I actually wished I had done.There's a show on HBO called ""Girls,"" and I know only enough about it to know it's not something I'd ever want to see.

198,foofighter-james,"Whimsical, perceptive but not hugely memorable",8,16 August 2013,"Not too much attention is focused on the obvious, the hows and whys of Frances' next moves, new temporary homes and vocational decisions. Where this might be seen to some as neglectful writing, or as one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes quite concisely put it, ""narrative drift"", it seems a deliberate move – a departure from one dimension of happening to another. Frances encapsulates her own predicament with a drunken moment of profundity at an otherwise uncomfortable dinner party, as she describes her complete attachment to an other 'dimension', the (not so much disillusion but) disassociation with reality, wherein she removes herself degree by degree from the realities she is shown in favour of her dreams, themselves rapidly losing steam instance by instance. Frances is a dreamer without a crutch, without companion to dream with, and as such her aspirations topple to the side while she continues to muddle through each the quarter-life bucket list of weekends in Europe and creative freedoms. The romantic angle, from which many films both of this ilk and in general struggle to shy, is delightfully downplayed, save for one or two select moments which admittedly the film could do without, but in my opinion is better off for keeping.Full review here: http://grimshawwrites.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/film- review-frances-ha/",Frances Ha
199,vsuziestandridge,Wonderful movie about friendship and growing up,10,18 August 2013,"I enjoyed this movie so much I went to see it twice. I could relate to the friendship that Francis and Sophie shared. Also the growing pains that one experiences growing up and joining the work world. It made me laugh. Francis character was so honest and real in ways that people don't open up and show all the sides to themselves. The friendships that Francis shared with the other characters in the movie reflect more accurately how most people walk around with mask or are totaling into themselves. Francis was full of life, as she danced from one place to another or ran!! I also like that it was shot in black and white and in NY, it added to the wonderfulness of the whole film. Gretta is a wonderful actress.I look forward to more films she will be in. I have recommended this movie to all my friend. I hope it will be available to purchase at some point.",Frances Ha

202,johnd-lynn89,Distracted By Frances Ha,9,2 January 2014,"The movie Frances Ha, directed by Noah Baumbach and co-written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, is, among other things, a beautiful and resounding portrait of a person who has ADHD. Frankly, I'm astonished to have not found a single critic mention Frances as having this disorder.If Frances Ha was only about a person's disorder, it would fall flat and not amount to much. Since mental health is never the primary focus of the movie, it doesn't stand in the way of the story, but is still very much a part of it. Instead, Frances Ha focuses on friendship, and the heartbreak that happens when two best friends who love each other, and live together, split. The better we understand this relationship between Frances and Sophie, the more clearly we see Frances has ADHD.Frances and Sophie sleep together. They also play-fight in Central Park, fantasize about their future life together, and play banjo and dance as pseudo street performers. As two endearing, borderline romantic montages set up their relationship, these two best friends seem inseparable. That is, until Sophie casually informs Frances on the subway ride home that she has decided to move in with another friend across town. Even though their lease ends in two months, Sophie has to take the apartment now, because the window is closing and this is Sophie's dream neighborhood. She wants to make sure that it is OK with Frances first, but she needs to know now.The first time that we see Frances and Sophie together, after Sophie mentioned her moving out, Frances is showing Sophie around her new apartment that she's moved into with Benji and Lev, two guys that Sophie introduced to Frances early in the film. Arranging clothes on Frances's bed, Sophie remarks, ""You're still messy."" Frances, grabbing the clothes from her, responds, ""I've been busy."" While Sophie tells Frances that she likes that about her, her messiness, there is still clearly a point of contention between the two from when they lived together. They also argue about Frances not remembering a text message from Sophie. This back and forth reflects an image of their living together that is not the joy filled montage or heartfelt conversation we're shown earlier. This is probably more in line with how Sophie remembers their living together. It wasn't all play-fighting.The films editing seems distracted at times, but it's really behaving like Frances behaves. One scene cut comes across just obvious enough. Benji and Frances are hanging out at the breakfast table when Lev and a girl that he picked up from the night before walk out of his room. The girl with Lev asks Frances if she wants a bagel. Looking to be heading out the door Frances responds, ""Oh no, thanks though. I wanted to go to the Met., and I have to deposit this check, and drop off my laundry. Got a whole Sunday planned."" Cut to Frances taking a large bite out of a bagel.One of the weakest points in the film, and one of my only criticisms, is when the movie is trying too hard to make this point. When Frances is eating the bagel at the breakfast table, the girl Lev is with, after realizing that she knows Sophie, mentions, ""You look older than Sophie, like a lot older, but less like grownup. It's weird."" Then Benji pitches in, ""But like, you don't have your *stuff* together."" Re-emphasizing a point that's already been made by having someone in the film explicitly say it, comes across too forcibly. It's one too many distractions from the plot for me.The moments are what you remember most in films. It's not the overarching plot line or subtle metaphors that stick with you. Frances Ha provides so many poignant moments. We forget that in life, small moments can be quite significant. You don't always have to become a great artist or dancer to have a wonderful life. Sometimes it can be enough just to meet someone who, like Frances, provides those beautiful moments. For Frances, that person is Sophie. The two eventually come to terms and reaffirm their love for each other after randomly running into each other at their alma mater. While Frances is taking care of Sophie, who drank too much, she admits to Sophie her feelings about Sophie leaving and now getting married to Patch, ""It's just, if something funny happens on the way to the deli, you'll only tell one person, and that'll be Patch, and I'll never hear about it.""With their friendship back, the film moves to the final chapter where Frances is now much more poised and professional. The fact that restoring her relationship with Sophie led to her successful and more ordered life, paints a particular picture of Frances and ADHD. Frances didn't just grow up and out of her childish ways because of some grand life lesson learned. What she did was grow stronger and more apt at handling life after going without and then rebuilding her closest relationship. Her disorder was only really a problem when the main love of her life was gone, acting as a major distraction for the rest of her life. For instance, she wasn't able or willing to process Benji's many obvious attempts to date her after the major love in her life had just left her. But once her relationship with Sophie was resolved, and Benji comes up to her at the after party to congratulate her, she doesn't call him Benji anymore. For the first time in the movie she calls him Ben. It's no coincidence that earlier in the film, right after talking about Benji, Frances brings up some guy named Georgie she's interested in, and Sophie says, ""Can't *have sex with* a Georgie!"" For the first time in the film, she's giving Ben all of her attention.",Frances Ha
203,rn-ucla,Worst highly regarded movie of the year,2,9 January 2014,"My girlfriend and I were excited to see this movie--(97% on Rotten Tomatoes)...but were extremely disappointed. We would have stopped half way through, but were convinced something redeeming would happen in the last half. There wasn't. Obviously we are outnumbered on this one. Why? I couldn't find a likable character anywhere in the movie. And Francis--cute and endearing to many, it seems--came across as shallow (with mindless drivel usually coming out of her mouth), spacey, childish (comes off as a needy grade schooler at times), entitled (that she can coach surf indefinetely) and selfish. She comes off as a stoner/dancer trust fund kid who hasn't worked a hard day in her life. She appears to be floating around New York with very little passion or interest in anything. Even her ""love"" of dancing feels lukewarm as she seems unwilling or unable to put any real work behind it (until the final scene of the movie). And you fly all the way to Paris just to sit in a coffee shop? C'mon. I'm sure this all sounds harsh for the vast majority of people who liked this film, but I haven't seen such annoying group of characters in a very long time.",Frances Ha

You'll want to kill yourself before she does. Did I want to? Yes. Did I? Of course not. I had to spare my life to warn others.

The idea that's an artsy film or a comedy is a farce -- what was central to this film was the faux friendship between two women, one of whom simply dumps the other to win the ""love"" marriage to an undefined rich man she seems to hate with passion.This film would have been far better had it explored the relationship between these two so-called friends, best friends. And how one of the two could simply end the friendship without explanation, without exploring why or how such love could be dismissed for the sake of marriage.A lot to be said about such female relationships -- this movie never bothered to identify how one friend could so drastically hurt another so supposedly beloved. And how the dumped friend could move on with love for her lost pal.I'm truly disappointed in what this movie is (nothing) compared to what it could have been. Very shocked at the high ratings.

207,ensormann,Frances Ha overreaches,1,24 January 2016,"Frances Ha seems to beg for love and forgiveness by literally stealing much of George Delerue's music from the wonderful ""King of Hearts"" (Alan Bates, Genevieve Bujold). It worked in King of Hearts. The music was written well and exactly for THAT movie, but it is casting pearls before swine to have swiped the exact same music and used it for the silly and sophomoric Frances Ha.This is a real problem with movies that have little to offer by themselves. The most desperate of producers and directors have their favorite all-time films to fall back upon, and and when their own abilities fail, many of them feel the need to quote their masters, often without crediting them. For this unfortunate film, it was Le Roi de Coeur.THe music from Le Roi de Coeur is not yet in public domain. If Frances Ha had had wider acceptance, there would have been a lawsuit. Stealing material without credit is plagiarism plain and simple, whether the old fits in the new guise or not--to my mind, Delerue's music is slandered here. Bah. A terrible movie with stolen music.
