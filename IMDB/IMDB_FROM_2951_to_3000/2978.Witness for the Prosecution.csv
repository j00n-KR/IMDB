0,MartinHafer,Dynamite courtroom drama,10,16 July 2006,"This is one of the absolute best courtroom movies ever made, along with ANATOMY OF A MURDER and THE VERDICT. All deserve a score of 10 and each is great in it own way.This film is great, but not for the realism of ANATOMY OF A MURDER. Instead, it's got such a wonderful script full of wonderful twists and turns. Plus, having top actors on the top of their game (such as Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlena Dietrich) made this such a great film. Plus, it has one of the best all-time endings on film.So is it realistic? Hardly, but given the magnificent script, this can easily be forgiven and just be enjoyed for the massive entertainment value it brings. If you don't enjoy this film, you must be dead!",Witness for the Prosecution
1,TheLittleSongbird,I Loved It!,9,29 April 2009,"I don't think that it is quite as good as And Then There Were None, but this is an extremely good film, and I am 17. Both my dad and I think it is a well-directed, well-acted and well-constructed courtroom film, right up there with Anatomy of a Murder. I genuinely enjoyed this film, and really don't understand why it is ignored by people.The direction was solid and tight, as is usually the case with the late Billy Wilder. He deserves to be known as a great director, up there with David Lean and Alfred Hitchkock, both of whom have directed some of the greatest cinematic masterpieces in existence. What impressed me most was the nail-biting suspense put into the script, which was not only tense but very funny as well, evident with the character of Sir Wilfred. I would have never guessed the final solution, that Christina Vole was the gypsy you meet halfway through, even if I was an Agatha Christie fan or not.The acting was what made the movie. Tyrone Power was very good as the defendant Stephen Vole, accused of killing a spinster. It is so sad that he died a year later while filming Solomon and Sheba, but he did very well in his last completed role. Marlene Dietrich was brilliant as Christina, and her scenes in the courtroom are the main reason why this film should be seen. Stealing the film, however, is Charles Laughton as Sir Wilfred Robarts, with his acidic remarks and his charismatic presence. The scene with the monocle and the light is probably the most famous scene of the film, or certainly the one I'm most familiar with, and that was genius.In conclusion, a brilliant film, that just lacks the suspense and terror of And Then there Were None, though both films are full of both elements. A must see! 9/10 Bethany Cox.",Witness for the Prosecution
2,bkoganbing,The Goal Is Always Justice,9,6 March 2006,"In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can't praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.Tyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she's murdered, Scotland Yard arrests Power.Power's solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor's advice.The original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957, but lost to Alec Guinness. Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She's a war bride over from Germany and she's got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself, but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration, the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.The Anglo-Saxon legal system's goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.",Witness for the Prosecution
3,Leofwine_draca,The best Christie adaptation,10,11 September 2021,"The best Agatha Christie adaptation I've yet watched. Based on a stage play and totally different to everything else I've seen from her. I do like the intensity of a good courtroom drama and this is it. Charles Laughton adds immeasurably to the experience with his wit and humour and of course Marlene Dietrich delivers a stand-out supporting turn. Best of all is Billy Wilder's direction which is exemplary, bringing out the depth and intrigue and suspense of it all.",Witness for the Prosecution
4,SnoopyStyle,Laughton amazing,8,21 January 2015,It's 1952 London. Barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) is returning to work after two months in the hospital being pestered by private nurse Miss Plimsoll. He takes on Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) as a new client despite medical advise. Vole is poor and accused of murdering a wealthy older widow Mrs. French who put him in her will. The wife Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich) is rather cold and provides him with an alibi. Surprisingly she gets called as a witness for the prosecution.This is a nice courtroom drama penned by Agatha Christie with a good final twist. Director Billy Wilder is sharp but it's Laughton that truly amazes. He is funny and endearing. He is the center and the most compelling character. Tyrone Power is OK but he seems to overact a little in a couple of scenes. Dietrich is as cold as ice. It's a good courtroom drama from that era.,Witness for the Prosecution
5,Hitchcoc,This had me to the bitter end!,9,10 March 2006,"I love it when a movie captivates me, carries me along, then surprises me at the end. This is a masterpiece of human maneuvering. It has outstanding acting and a plot to die for. This is a fairly pedestrian Agatha Christie short story. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful story, just that it doesn't come to life like it does on the screen. Charles Laughton is the wonder barrister who is taking the case, even though he is in poor health. The murder case seems a relatively simple one until we begin to trip over the many layers left lying on the path. Marlene Dietrich does a masterful job in all her roles (I won't say anymore than that so I don't spoil the ending). Tyrone Power is able to balance his pathos and his potential guilt. The beauty of the movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. There are some modestly funny subplots and a great deal of careful investigation. I guarantee you that once you start watching, you won't be able to turn it off.",Witness for the Prosecution
6,Prismark10,No objections,8,30 October 2016,"After watching the film I felt that the actual Agatha Christie book could not be as good. Billy Wilder and his writers expand on this but more importantly make a riveting and fast paced court room drama.The interesting part is that this film was made in the USA with the usual bunch of Brits living abroad but you would not think from the courtroom scenes that this movie was made in Hollywood.Charles Laughton plays Wilfred Roberts the curmudgeonly, crafty and hefty barrister who has returned to his chambers after a period of ill health. Accompanied by his nagging nurse (Elsa Lanchester) who wants him to rest and take things easy, he immediately takes on a murder case.Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is charged with murder of a wealthy older woman who he has been seeing in order to secure an investment for his invention. The evidence is circumstantial but Vole comes across as naive but emotional. Marlene Dietrich is Vole's enigmatic German wife, grateful to him for bringing him over from war torn Germany.Dietrich is the defence witness who becomes the witness for the prosecution. Roberts is puzzled as to why she has switched sides and what motives she might have.The film is well paced, well crafted and director Billy Wilder just made it so easy going even though he adds some legalese here and there. Wonderful performances by all the actors. Tyrone Power does stick out as a bit odd with his mid Atlantic accent. In the court scenes he comes across as over emotional but there is another charade being played all along.",Witness for the Prosecution
7,claudio_carvalho,Another Remarkable Movie by Billy Wilder,10,12 March 2005,"When the efficient but bitter and stubborn barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) returns to his office in London recovering from a heart attack, he is invited to defend Leonard Stephen Vole (Tyrone Power), who is the prime suspect in a murder case. Leonard is a former soldier that fought in World War II and is married with his beloved German wife Christine Helm Vole (Marlene Dietrich). He is unemployed and accused of seducing and murdering the wealthy middle-aged single woman Emily French (Norma Varden) to inherit 80,000 pounds. His unique alibi would be the testimony of Christine, which would not be accepted by the court, since she is his wife. Along the trial, Christine is surprisingly called to testify in court by the prosecution, when secrets about their lives are disclosed.""Witness for the Prosecution"" is another remarkable movie by Billy Wilder and one of the best about trial. The plot is perfectly tied-up without any flaw in the screenplay, which has many plot points and witty lines in a perfect combination of the caustic and sarcastic ""British humor"" with crime, drama and mystery. The cast has awesome performances, highlighting Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Billy Wilder is one of my favorite directors and his direction is once again outstanding. Last time I saw this movie was on 12 March 2005 on VHS and today I have watched it on DVD for the fifth or sixth time. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Testemunha de Acusação"" (""Witness for the Prosecution"")",Witness for the Prosecution
8,classicsoncall,"""And that my Lord is the case for the defense.""",8,30 June 2012,"I just learned that Captain Kidd was married to the Bride of Frankenstein - how cool is that? That would have been some household to hang around in if Laughton and Lanchester didn't take their characters too far. Personally I can't picture either one being married to the other, but who am I to say?For a two hour long picture, this one simply flew by. It was clever and entertaining, made particularly humorous by Laughton's posturing and the complicity of his butler's (Ian Wolfe) involvement in all of Sir Wilfrid's destructive personal habits. For some reason I thought Sir Wilfrid's rearranging of his pills in court would end up meaning something, but turns out it was just a clever distraction.The one character that DID rouse my suspicion was that lady Diana (Ruta Lee) in the courtroom attending her 'first trial'. I just knew she was going to figure in the resolution somehow and it became fairly transparent during the interrogation about the cruise business. Old housekeeper Janet (Una O'Connor) had it right when she called Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) a 'shiftless, schemin' rascal', so by the end of the story one has good reason to feel antagonistic toward him.I got a kick out of the closing credits when the narrator asks the viewer not to divulge the ending to prospective film goers. I'm sure the players had a great time filming this courtroom thriller, and if I had to bet, I'd say Laughton really did smoke that cigar injected with brandy.",Witness for the Prosecution
9,gavin6942,Best Trial Movie Ever?,8,8 April 2011,"Agatha Christie tale of a man, Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Power), on trial for murder: a trial featuring surprise after surprise. Sir Wilfred Robarts (Charles Laughton) is his learned attorney who is banned from drinking, smoking and women... but he goes against the rules.Front and center is Marlene Dietrich, as German actress and songstress Christine Helm-Vole, not much of a stretch for her, but probably her greatest role (prove me wrong).The defendant relies on his corrupt wife ""like a drowning man clutching at a razor blade"". I find this an interesting depiction of a murder trial in England, more or less the same as a trial in America.All this from director Billy Wilder, who never made a bad film.",Witness for the Prosecution
10,lee_eisenberg,You must witness this movie,10,9 May 2005,"I have never seen a Billy Wilder movie that I didn't like, and to say that ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is another example of his masterpieces does not do it justice (pun not intended). In the movie, American Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power, who died shortly after they finished filming) is accused of murdering a woman in England. He hires Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), a reputable attorney, to defend him. To get more information about everything, Robarts consults with Vole's wife Christine.But that's where things take an unexpected turn. As the trial - and the movie - progress, we keep learning secrets that the characters have been keeping. By the courtroom climax, all bets are off, to say the least.This just may be the perfect movie. No matter what you suspect, I guarantee that you will be surprised. You will never look at a trial the same again. And above all, it confirms Billy Wilder as one of the greatest directors in history.",Witness for the Prosecution
11,jboothmillard,Witness for the Prosecution,8,5 July 2009,"I enjoy courtroom dramas, like Anatomy of a Murder and A Few Good Men, and this one from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, Some Like It Hot) was my next to try. Based on the Agatha Christie play, this sees unemployed egg-beater inventor Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) arrested for the suspected murder of rich widow Emily Jane French (Norma Varden). Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Charles Laughton), recently recovering from a near-fatal heart attack, agrees to defend Leonard, but the only alibi available seems to be from his wife, the calculating Christine (Golden Globe nominated Marlene Dietrich). As the witnesses answer the questions and give the evidence, including housemaid Miss Plimsoll (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's wife, and whose character was put in by Wilder and the co-writers), there is no clear verdict. That is until the prosecution calls Christine, and all the words that come out of her mouth spell disaster for Sir Wilfred and Leonard. But before the case is concluded, a mysterious woman gives Sir Wilfred some letters that prove Christine was seeing someone else and refusing an alibi. So in the end, you'd expect the end to be Leonard found innocent, but he wasn't, and Christine knew this, but Leonard admits wanting to leave her, and she kills him, and it ends with Sir Wilfred agreeing to defend her in trial. Also starring John Williams as Brogan-Moore, Henry Daniell as Mayhew, Ian Wolfe as Carter, Torin Thatcher as Mr. Myers, Una O'Connor as Janet McKenzie, Francis Compton as Judge, Philip Tonge as Inspector Hearne and Ruta Lee as Diana. Almost all courtroom films are going to engage you, with all the evidence and choice of witnesses popping up, your going to enjoy guessing the conclusion, and this certainly delivers with a great cast. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Charles Laughton was number 45 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 37 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Witness for the Prosecution
12,ccthemovieman-1,EntertainingTrial Movie That Still Holds Up,9,8 November 2005,"This is one of the best ""trial movies"" ever made. It's an outstanding film that is just as good today as it was almost 50 years ago when it was released in the theaters. The shocking ending caused quite a stir back then, too.The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power's character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.Otherwise, it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton, who plays Power's defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton's nurse. She, too, demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.If you like some fine drama, storyline twists, a little humor thrown in and great acting and dialog, this is a classic film to check out.",Witness for the Prosecution
13,rmax304823,Suspenseful and amusing Christie,7,11 January 2006,"It's hard to imagine how Dame Agatha could have pounded out so many mysteries. I know she lived a long time, but still, if I lived as long as Methusala I couldn't grind out that many pieces. Not just novels, either, but plays, including this one. And they all tell the kinds of stories that involve a lot of lead time while the author works out the details of the intricate plots. Between Jack Kerouac knocking out ""On The Road"" on a single roll of toilet paper or whatever it was, and Nabokov and his multitudinous 3 X 5 index cards, Christie must have been very much closer to Nabokov.This is an engrossing and tightly wound tale of greed, murder, deception, bigamy, adultery, and all the other good things in life. It's essentially a courtroom drama with several big -- REALLY big -- surprises. It does not end the way you might expect, with the true criminal suddenly revealed in all his moral turpitude by the expert, penetrating examination by the defense, breaking down in the witness chair and sobbing, ""Okay. I did it! I DID IT! I didn't mean to kill her! I just wanted to frighten her."" The play's the thing in this movie, yet the director, Billy Wilder, brings his own snappy interpretation to it. The dialog is unashamedly fast. Nobody dawdles over ""significant utterances."" Even on the witness stand they seem to make a series of unhesitating declarations. ""Yes."" ""No."" ""Yes, I told you already."" And it wouldn't be as good as it is without the acting. Charles Laughton is the central figure, one of those cute old curmudgeons that everyone likes because of his weakness for cigars and brandy. His efforts to bootleg these items under the nose of his nurse, his real wife Elsa Lanchester, are pretty funny. ""She won't even find the ASHES,"" he cackles innocently, like a child getting away with mischief, flicking his cigar ash into an empty drawer. She's always bright and chipper and energetic, a nice contrast to his flabby sedate presence.Una O'Connor as the Scottish maid is extremely engaging as well, snapping back indignantly at the judge. Tyrone Power is called on to change from a careless and thoughtful guy, to one stricken by fate, then back again, and he pulls it off. Henry Daniell, a Robin Hood villain, and John Williams, ever the legal type, are welcome in every scene in which they appear. Reliable sorts, don't you know. But Marlene Dietrich takes the palm. She was everyone's idea of a no-baloney kind of woman but never anyone's idea of a great actress. And yet, she had me fooled here. Oh, hammy, sure, but her performances fit in because EVERYONE is hammy in ""Witness for the Prosecution."" God forbid anyone try to make anything serious and arty out of an Agatha Christie mystery! They're fine, just as they are.",Witness for the Prosecution
14,ma-cortes,A Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game masterfully played and perfectly directed by the great Billy Wilder,8,18 August 2015,"Entertaining suspense movie packs thrills , intrigue , twists and turns ; being realized in Hitchcock style . As the tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses including sensational acting , enjoyable dialog and interesting screenplay from start to finish . Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is detained on suspicion of killing an elderly acquaintance . He employs an experienced but aging barrister, Sir Wilfrid (Charles Lawton) as his defense attorney who is recovering from a severe heart attack . The ill advocate at law is attended by a nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester , they were real-life husband and wife). Excellent film packs drama , emotion , suspense and plot twists . This agreeable and often intriguing picture from master of comedy has a memorable scene after another . It contains interesting intrigue based on Agatha Christie's novel , fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The film followed the basic story of Agatha Christie's play, but director and co-screenwriter Billy Wilder opened up the story by including numerous scenes that did not take place solely in the courtroom, as the play had, and changed the emphasis from ""Leonard Vole"" to ""Sir Wilfrid Robarts¨. Top-notch and unforgettable performance from Charles Laughton as the peculiar as well as intelligent barrister , throwing himself into the role with dedication and delight . Nice acting by Tyrone Power , this would be his last complete film , he would die of a heart attack while on the set of his next film (Salomon) less than one year after release of this one . Sensational support cast , including familiar faces such as Elsa Lanchester , John Williams , Henry Daniell , Ruta Lee , Torin Thatcher and veteran Ian Wolfe . Special mention for Una O'Connor , this was Una O'Connor's last big screen motion picture and she was the only member of the original Broadway cast of the play to repeat her role on film . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Russell Harlan . The producers were so concerned about the financial success of the film that during the credits, an announcer urges the audience not to reveal the film's ending to anyone . Lavishly produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Edward Small , as the courtroom setting, which cost $75,000 to build, was a recreation of an actual courtroom in London's Central Criminal Courts , The Old Bailey. The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines , amusing dialogues , humor and entertaining intrigue . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , this ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Witness for prosecution¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching . It justly deserves its place among the best ¨Court Dramas¨ ever made . One of the very best films of all time and to see and see again . An extremely entertaining and riveting film and completely provoking , as it ranked #6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"" . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",Witness for the Prosecution
15,moonspinner55,Courtroom drama par excellence...,8,6 July 2008,"Combination of Agatha Christie's play, Billy Wilder's fluid direction, and superlative star performances by Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power help make this a quite extraordinary (if outré) courtroom drama. Laughton plays a brandy-swilling English barrister defending Power on the charge of murder; Dietrich is Power's German wife, who claims her husband is guilty; Elsa Lanchester (never better) is Laughton's devoted nurse and John Williams (superior, as always) is his legal assistant. Don't be put off by the powdered wigs or the legalese: Wilder keeps this intriguing case peppered with amusing incident, and the double-twist finale is staged with aplomb. If it's all a bit over-the-top, that's forgivable, for the picture is full of ""actors"" (on the surface and undercover) and everyone here has a grand time. Six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Wilder for Best Director, Laughton as Best Actor and Lanchester as Best Supporting Actress (she won the Golden Globe in this category). One BAFTA nomination: for Laughton as Best Foreign Actor. Wilder was also nominated by the DGA for Outstanding Directorial Achievement. *** from ****",Witness for the Prosecution
16,blanche-2,One of the best ever,10,7 August 2005,"Based on the wonderful play by Agatha Christie, the film version of Witness for the Prosecution is a magnificent film, one of the best ever. It was given the all star treatment - directed by Billy Wilder, starring Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, Charles Laughton, and Elsa Lanchester. Right there is all you need to know.This is one of Charles Laughton's greatest performances. He's absolutely superb as the ailing man who risks his health to defend Leonard Vole (Power) on a murder charge, over the strenuous objections of his nurse, Lanchester, who is hilarious. Dietrich is great as Leonard Vole's seemingly uncaring wife, Christine, in the most difficult role in the movie.As Leonard Vole, Tyrone Power is a little more problematic as he is somewhat miscast. One of the most beautiful-looking men who ever lived, he's a tad old for the role, not quite jaunty enough when he needs to be, and very un-British. For an international star to have put on a British accent after 22 years in films would have been both distracting and ridiculous. However, no one could do charming like Power, in real life and in reel life. In that sense, he's perfect. As far as comments that he was ""hammy"" in the role - he wasn't the ham - Leonard Vole was the ham! It was a role within a role. Power hands in an excellent performance, his last, and he's especially enjoyable in his flashback scene with Dietrich (who during the filming kept bringing him gifts while Charles Laughton leered at him - I'd say he still had it big time). If you haven't read the play or story, you won't guess the ending of Wilder's masterful film. Oh, and look for a young Ruta Lee in the courtroom.",Witness for the Prosecution
17,Quinoa1984,a very good movie with two towering performances,9,11 June 2015,"Sir Wilfrid is such a bothersome, craggly old sod. He's just gotten back from having a heart attack, and is very big and very weak. But that doesn't mean he will give up his brandy or his cigars very easily, even if it means he has to stuff the later into his cane by secret compartment. He's a barrister, and a legendary one; he gets a case and it could very well be his last (probably before this became a cliché, the ""final"" go-around for a character who's been around the block), involving a man seemingly wrongfully accused of killing an old lady who he became friendly with right before she was offed. Who did it? Was it him? Can it be proved that there's reasonable suspicion, at least in British court's eyes. He has to defend this man, Leonard Vole (Power), with his German wife (Dietrich) not really someone he wants to put on the stand to defend him. And while all this is going on, he has to watch his pill intake and swap his hot cocoa for brandy without his nurse watching.This is the Charles Laughton show, and while he is joined by another giant of cinema with Marlene Dietrich (really a supporting role for her), his only other male counter is Tyrone Power, who is good for what he's asked for but not much more. Don't get me wrong, he's really good as Leonard Vole... but when Laughton is on screen, even when he just does a simple 'parumph' or what have you, a sigh, a flicker of the eyes, he is magnetizing. He makes Sir Wilfrid, who is cantankerous at best and a total a-hole at worst, almost sympathetic in a way: he's been through a lot, and the only way he can cope is to be this hard to put up with. Probably those around him put up with it - certainly his beleaguered nurse - because he isn't exactly a *mean* person, which is key. He's just used to what he's used to. What may have been a wonderful character on the page becomes almost monolithic on the screen.Wilder apparently didn't have much problem with Laughton - who could be troublesome for directors - and probably it was due to the script being just so good. With the exception of perhaps the final thirty seconds, which I just didn't understand (why, Wilfrid, why do that), it's a crackerjack murder mystery, and I think the filmmakers, as well as original author Christie, knew what they were doing with it. It's not a super-deep tale, but one of a crowd-pleaser, meant as an entertaining whodunit; ironically people got this mixed up with Hitchcock's Paradine Case, which isn't as intense or funny as this film, and only has Laughton (there as a judge) to liven it up.It can be criticized, perhaps, for being 'stagey', and it's because it was a play. When you watch the film notice there are really only a handful of sets, such as the Barrister's office, the courtroom, and maybe the prison and the bar where a key meeting takes place late in the film. But Wilder films all his actors in good pacing and angles, and keeps the tension building up while every so often giving a moment for some suspense with the Barrister himself: will his heart keep him going? It's interesting to see how much of this hinges on the personalities even more than the plot, but this is really what makes it work. The story itself is fine, sometimes more than fine, intriguing. But without the sense of doubt about the main characters, for Leonard and Christine, we wouldn't get wrapped up in how it's going to turn out.It can also be said that the final reveals/twists are playing it kind of cheap, like cheating the audience. But I don't know in this case if that's so - I think the turns are always going back to character, and also the nature of the 'trust' in the British legal system, of which Barrister Wilfrid is kind of an old legend. Witness for the Prosecution is about this lawyer, who is smart, ruthless (in his way) and never less than able to give a cutting remark, but it's also about performance itself and how this plays into the story that's being told. And certainly Dietrich gives one of her major performances here, even with her limited screen time - as cold and brutal and kind of femme-fatalish as they come. Just shy of a masterpiece. 9.5/10",Witness for the Prosecution
18,JohnHowardReid,This witness is an absolute must!,9,23 December 2017,"Naturally, the most popular Agatha Christie movie ever made, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957), although it looks as British as Big Ben, was actually filmed in Hollywood. Thanks to its great cast - Tyrone Power and Una O'Connor in their final movies, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester, John Williams, Henry Daniell, and stage actor Francis Thompson as the judge - and the clever way the writers have opened out the stage play, this ""Witness for the Prosecution"" really grips and holds the interest even for those members of the audience (like myself) who know the plot backwards. Billy Wilder's direction is as adroit as ever, but on this occasion, it is skilfully impersonal, allowing players and plot to adroitly command and dominate center stage. This movie is currently available on an excellent 10/10 M-G-M DVD.",Witness for the Prosecution
19,edwagreen,Be Witness to this Fine Prosecution ****,10,14 August 2006,"A gem of a 1957 film. How Tyrone Power wasn't nominated for best actor here was a major surprise. Charles Laughton was and deservedly so as the terrific defense attorney who brought comic relief into the film by fooling Elsa Lanchester, who received a supporting actress bid. Remember how he would smuggle liquor into the courtroom and manage to sneak a cigar when she wasn't around? His performance was as always a masterful one.As Paul Vole, Power is a man accused of murder. He calmly assumes the role of being accused of a murder. He definitely receives sympathy from the audience during his outbursts in court when his wife Christine (Dietrich) testifies against him. The victim was veteran Norma Varden (the housekeeper years later in ""The Sound of Music."") Marlene Dietrich was his love interest who gets him off only to have quite a rude awakening afterwards.The film was terrific in every way possible. You want to sympathize with Power and then have utter contempt on him when it appears that he has pulled a fast one on the judicial system. Charles Laughton is absolutely magnificent as Sir Wifred, the defense attorney, who undertakes the case after recently suffering a coronary. He is a master in the court when he challenges just about everything that the prosecuting attorney states. Dietrich has never been better. She comes across as an uncaring wife, despite the fact that Vole has brought her out of the ruins of Nazi Germany in 1945. Veteran pro, Una O'Connor, steals the scene she is in as a witness who was Varden's maid and apparent heir to the latter's fortune before Power stepped in. As his nurse, Elsa Lanchester, the real life Mrs. Charles Laughton, was also Oscar nominated in the supporting Oscar. A pain in Sir Wilfrid's rear end, she comes to realize that her patient will not be ready for that Bermuda vacation at the end of the trial. This best picture nominee of 1957 is well-worth seeing.

20,wes-connors,A Perfect Ten Star Witness,10,16 April 2014,"Returning to his London home after a lengthy hospital stay, blustery barrister Charles Laughton (as Wilfrid Robarts) has been advised to give up cigars, brandy and female companions. The first two are a problem for Mr. Laughton, who is recovering from a serious heart attack. Moreover, he has also been advised to stay away from his specialty – stressful criminal cases. Trying to keep Laughton away from his vices is talkative live-in nurse Elsa Lanchester (as Miss Plimsoll). She is no match for Laughton as an intriguing case arrives. The client is all-American nice-guy Tyrone Power (as Leonard Vole), who was seen at the home of wealthy widow Norma Varden (as Emily French) on the day she was murdered. An aspiring inventor, Mr. Power looks even guiltier when he inherits a generous sum from the lonely older woman. Power's alibi is expected to be his wife, German actress Marlene Dietrich (as Christine Helm Vole). However, Laughton expects Ms. Dietrich's supportive testimony will be dismissed because she is the accused's wife...""Witness for the Prosecution"" is wildly entertaining and engaging, from start to finish. This began with a story from the great mystery writer Agatha Christie. It's re-worked perfectly for the big screen, with the extraordinary Billy Wilder as guiding force; this man knows how to make movies. Producer Arthur Hornblow Jr., photographer Russell Harlan and editor Daniel Mandell should also be proud. Laughton is in fine form and likely would have won some ""Best Actor"" awards had it not been for the fact that he's so often this good. Dietrich received great notices and was certainly worthy of the ""Academy Award"" nomination many expected her to receive. In his last finished film, sadly, Power might have been more celebrated as a ""Best Supporting Actor"" had he not been billed as the lead. Added for humor and building up Laughton's part, Ms. Lancaster was rightfully praised for her support. The smaller roles are just as wonderfully cast. The film ends with a voice-over advising viewers not to reveal the ending to anyone – so don't.********** Witness for the Prosecution (12/17/57) Billy Wilder ~ Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power, Elsa Lanchester",Witness for the Prosecution
21,Coventry,The Mother of all Courtroom dramas/thrillers.,9,27 October 2017,"Yours truly has never been much of a reader, though with one notable exception: the work of Agatha Christie. I absolutely, positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels, short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a genuine classic, and although somewhat atypical for Christie, it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There's one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie's whodunits, of course, namely that you can't experience the same astounding twist-in-the-end twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film- version, especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story, with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists, does remain the movie's biggest strongpoint, but there are a number of more reasons why ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder's surefooted direction, for one, and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already, but there's also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton (arguably the most shamefully neglected actor/director in history) and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate success-factor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful re-creation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors, the echoing acoustics, the powerful monologues of confident (and arrogant) barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make ""Witness for the Prosecution"" not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan, but practically ALL great courtroom-dramas that were released from the sixties until present day (""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Philadelphia"", ""Devil's Advocate"", ""A Few Good Men"") were clearly influenced by ""Witness for the Prosecution"". In fact, I only have one minor complaint: *** Spoiler **** the film version adds one more final twist that I didn't find 100% plausible.",Witness for the Prosecution
22,sunwarrior13,A Courtroom Drama Classic,10,7 September 2012,"Witness for the Prosecution is a courtroom drama film based on a short story by Agatha Christie dealing with the trial of a man accused of murder. The first film adaptation of this story was made in 1957 and it stars Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, and Charles Laughton, and features Elsa Lanchester. The film was adapted by Larry Marcus, Harry Kurnitz and the film's director Billy Wilder.Having just recovered from a heart attack, fabled British barrister Sir Wilfred Robards,played by Laughton, has been ordered by his doctor to give up everything he holds dear-brandy, cigars and especially courtroom cases. Robards' already shaky resolve to follow doctor's orders flies out the window when he takes up the defense of Leonard Vole,the film role of Tyrone Power, a personable young man accused of murdering a rich old widow. The case becomes something of a sticky wicket when Vole's ""loving"" German wife Christine,portrayed by Marlene Dietrich,announces that she's not legally married to Robards' client-and she fully intends to appear as a witness for the prosecution.A delicious Billy Wilder mixture of humor, intrigue and melodrama, Witness for the Prosecution is distinguished by its hand-picked supporting cast: John Williams as the police inspector, Henry Daniell as Robards' law partner, Una O'Connor as the murder victim's stone-deaf maid, Torin Thatcher as the prosecutor, Ruta Lee as a sobbing courtroom spectator, and Charles Laughton's wife Elsa Lanchester as Robards' ever- chipper nurse (a role especially written for the film, so that Lanchester could look after Laughton on the set). This Oscar-nominated courtroom drama represents Wilder at his most theatrical and old-fashioned, but the saga is enjoyable and so is the acting of the cast.This certainly can be classified as a movie classic due to that reason alone.Finally,this classic plays the suspense well - a reason why this movie still gains appreciation at present after years it has been released..It is also worth noting that not divulging the ending has made it interesting for many years to come that it has led to many other film and TV adaptations.",Witness for the Prosecution
23,hitchcockthelegend,I'm constantly surprised that women's hats don't provoke more murders.,9,4 March 2008,"Leonard Steven Vole finds himself on trial for the murder of a wealthy widow from whom he has inherited a fortune. Top barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts takes up the defendants case, but he, along with everyone else, is stunned when Vole's seemingly loving wife Christine turns up to testify against the defendant.Based on Agatha Christie's successful 1953 play, ""Witness For The Prosecution"" benefited from fine tuning from master director Billy Wilder and writing partner Harry Kurnitz. Here the dialogue becomes razor sharp and the characters are fully realised with quite wonderful results, but chiefly the masterstroke here is not letting a court room drama become just that, a court room drama. The film plays out with no wasted scenes, no moments of boredom, and it has such vim and vigour you sometimes forget that there actually is drama in the story.The cast here are on fine form, Wilder had wanted to work with Charles Laughton for some time, and it's obvious that both parties here are getting the best out of each other. Laughton is a pure delight as Robarts, a sharp tongue, all bluster and cheeky into the bargain, his interplay with Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's real life wife Elsa Lanchester) is quality, and it's another testament to Wilder's genius for putting them together. Tyrone Power, in what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away, is devilishly smart as Vole, whilst Torin Thatcher is great as the gruff prosecution barrister Myers. Yet as good as they all are, they all sit in the shadow of Marlene Dietrich and her turn as Christine Vole, sultry and femme fatalistic, it's a sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film.It occurred to me overnight that it's probably the closest film that Wilder got to being Hitchcockian, and I'm pretty sure the big master of suspense himself would have enjoyed this one. It's a mystery that is dramatic, it's a thriller that is also funny, it's pretty much a multi genre classic. 9/10",Witness for the Prosecution
24,jotix100,The burden of proof,9,26 October 2004,"The superb adaptation of Agatha Christie's play is evident in this movie of 1957, which, by the way, it's still interesting to watch today, as it must was in the theater. The film was greatly helped by the direction of Billy Wilder who was able to achieve great performances all around from his cast.Of course, this film belongs to Charles Laughton's brilliant performance as the barrister, Sir Wilfred Robarts. Mr. Laughton's genius was evident in his body of work, but with this role, he excels. Charles Laughton was one of the best actors of his generation. This courtroom drama packs a lot of surprises. One of the most pleasant ones was Marlene Dietrich. She played the German wife of the man accused of killing the widow he seduced for ulterior motives. Ms. Dietrich who was one of the coolest actresses of her era, shows a range not seen before. Her character is seen at different times of her life and she is totally convincing to be that person.The weakest link in the film is Tyrone Power. This actor was getting over a heart attack and he shows that illness had not been kind to him. His interpretation of Leonard Vole is a puzzle, at best. He is supposed to be an Englishman, but his American accent was something the director, or the studio didn't care much since Tyrone Power was one of the greatest stars in the business. His portrayal of the accused man robs the film of authenticity. This role should have been played by a British actor.The incomparable Elsa Lanchester makes an appearance as Sir Wilfred's nurse, a role that was not in the original play. Ms. Lanchester was an wonderful actress who could steal films from leading stars. In this film she is fabulous as the meddlesome nurse who wants the best for her patient. Also good in the film, Una O'Connor as the maid, Janet McKenzie who can smell a rat when she sees one. Norma Varden as the widow, Emily French was delightful. The English cast is excellent.",Witness for the Prosecution
25,Hey_Sweden,This viewer has reached a verdict: this movie is tremendously entertaining.,9,4 September 2016,"Hollywood legend Tyrone Power, in his final completed film role, plays Leonard Vole, accused of the murder of a lonely rich middle aged woman, Mrs. Emily Jane French (Norma Varden). They'd struck up a friendship, and he continued to see her in the hopes that she'd finance the inventions that he wanted to market. Now she's dead, and all evidence points to him being the killer. Taking his case is the irascible, witty barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts (Charles Laughton, in a delicious, Oscar nominated performance), who's recovering from a heart attack.This viewer shouldn't relay too much about the plot, but, as adapted from Agatha Christies' play, it's riveting stuff. While it obviously derives from a stage work with so much focus on dialogue and performance, it's the crackling, often funny dialogue and superior acting that makes this so effective and seemingly quickly paced for a film running just under two hours. The script, written by Harry Kurnitz and the well regarded director Billy Wilder, obviously takes great delight in the twist laden scenario. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is often throwing surprises at the audience, and while more savvy folk may be able to predict a fair deal, the ways in which characters and viewers alike are manipulated is nothing short of masterful.There's a great deal of humor to be found in the relationship between Sir Wilfrid and his nursemaid Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester, a.k.a. Mrs. Laughton). She's annoying in a lively, endearing way, and his reactions to her are simply priceless. Lanchester was also Oscar nominated for her scene stealing, comedic work.There are no slackers here, especially when you realize there are performances within performances being given here. Power is quite engaging, and Marlene Dietrich is highly striking as the German woman whom he took as a ""wife"". Wonderful support is provided by John Williams, Henry Daniell, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, Ms. Varden, Una O'Connor (that scenery devouring player from some of the Universal horror films of the 1930s, cast here as the housekeeper), Francis Compton, Philip Tonge, and Ruta Lee.The filmmaking is slick without calling attention to itself, with Wilder and company completely trusting the source material. The result is a smashing entertainment that deserves to be rediscovered.Nine out of 10.",Witness for the Prosecution

His wife (Marlene Dietrich) also believes he did it and testifies against him in court. A powerful, brilliant lawyer (Charles Laughton) believes Power is innocent and does his best to prove it.Sounds dull but it's not. I caught this on TV way back in the 1970s. I started watching it casually but very soon was caught up in it. The script is smart and, even though it's over 2 hours, it never feels too long. There are many ingenious twists and turns and an ending that (I have to admit) I didn't see coming at all. I've seen it many times since and never tire of it.The acting is great. Power is good in one of his last roles; Laughton is just superb as the lawyer--he throws out one liners or insults so casually that it's hard to believe he's just acting. I never found Dietrich that good of an actress--I hate to admit this, but her accent always made me giggle. However she's great here--especially at the end. Also Elsa Lanchester is a scream as Laughton's by the book nurse. Her and Laughton had a marriage of ""convenience"" for many years and their fondness for each other comes through making their verbal fights even funnier.A wonderful, exciting, fun courtroom drama--one of the best ever made.

28,CinemaSerf,Christie gets the Wilder treatment and Laughton is outstanding...,9,1 December 2019,"I might be asking for trouble here, but did Charles Laughton ever actually make a bad film? He leads this one as the brilliant but curmudgeonly barrister Sir Wildred Robarts with oodles of charisma and style. Marlene Dietrich portrays the evil, manipulative Christine Vole marvellously and even Tyrone Power, more the matinée idol than the serious actor, delivers as required in Billy Wilder's outstanding rendition of the Agatha Christie story. Elsa Lanchester is suitably annoying/scary/lovable as the nurse trying to keep her ailing charge from keeling over mid-trial and a slew of other capable British actors fill in the supporting roles well. It is one of those very rare occasions where everything just gels perfectly and it really is fun to watch.

Or, if you will, it takes a cinematic genius to make Agatha Christie work and Billy Wilder is just such a genius. Alas, not even Wilder could fully restrain arch-ham Laughton from taking the odd king-size bite out of any available scenery but by and large Laughton IS restrained and all the better for it. Co-stars Ty Power and Marlene Dietrich are their usual pro selves and the supporting cast which has the feel of being hand-picked - Ian Wolfe, Henry Daniell, John Williams plus Mrs Laughton, Elsa Lanchester are all right on the money. Though he barely 'opens up' the play on which it is based Wilder has no problem retaining interest even in black and white and with his usual no-nonsense camera angles - he clearly saw no point in tracking Tyrone Power down the street and back up again, content to leave no-brainers like that to the Godards of this world. I've never been much of a Dietrich fan, she's always seemed a tad mannered to me but if I have one cavil it is that Power would dump someone as substantial as Dietrich for the totally vapid 'other woman' with whom he went off at the end. Apart from that this is another vintage Wilder.",Witness for the Prosecution
30,lastliberal,Superb courtroom drama,8,7 July 2008,"I just finished watching Live Free and Die Harder for the second time. I was blown away by the special effects, and Bruce Willis' capability to take more punishment than a human could be expected to and live.After that I wanted something that had the same fireworks but done with acting and not special effects. This film fit the bill nicely.The acting in this film was so spectacular that calls for every superlative in the book. While I have watched Billy Wilder direct comedy, I never expected to see him do something that rivals Hitchcock. In fact, if you didn't know it was Wilder beforehand, you would easily call this a Hitchcock film.Tyrone Power as the defendant was so smooth that you knew he was a guilty man. You just knew it, even though he kept denying it. He was perfect as the cad that preys on elderly women. Marlene Dietrich gave what I thought was the performance of a lifetime as his wife. She definitely provided the fireworks and the surprises to this film. Charles Laughton as the barrister that tried the case was magnificent. There are not enough words to describe the performance he provided. Supreme enjoyment every time he opened his mouth. Of course, you cannot ignore Elsa Lanchester as the nurse that failed miserably at trying to control Laughton after a heart attack. The two of them provided so much humor to this film that one would want to see it again and again just for that.Nothing can be said about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it.

Directed and adapted for the screen by Billy Wilder from the Agatha Christie play, it is everything a legal drama should be. Has the interesting set up, sketching the background. The courtroom scenes, which take up most of the movie, are incredibly compelling viewing. You hang on every word, especially as Charles Laughton's performance, as the defense barrister Sir Wilfred Robards, is so superb.But wait that's not all...(saying anything more would give away too much).As mentioned, Charles Laughton's performance is brilliant. He captures the spirit of curmudgeonly and sharp-tongued yet humorous Sir Wilfred Robards perfectly. Good support from Marlene Dietrich and Elsa Lanchester.Only negative aspect to the entire movie is the performance of Tyrone Power.

Both seem to understand better than the stiff-backed and Brill-creme-haired Tyrone Power that the material is not to be taken too seriously, and it's a ball to watch them trade barbs back and forth (she plays nurse to his ailing prosecutor) with twinkles in their eyes. The story itself is shamelessly manipulative -- Laughton's character suffers from a heart condition that threatens to kill him in the middle of the trial, for God's sake! -- yet it worked at keeping me in suspense despite myself. And may I just say that Marlene Dietrich appears in one of the most bizarre performances I've ever seen on film.Won't tax your intellect, but will probably tickle your funny bone.Grade: B+",Witness for the Prosecution
33,AlsExGal,"""I suspected something, but not that. Never that!""",10,7 September 2015,"That's a quotation from the film and what you'll say at the conclusion. I saw it the first time 36 years ago back when network TV ran old movies late at night, and I'd never even heard of it. I thought it was a Hitchcock film with all of the unexpected twists, but no, the director was Billy Wilder. How surprised I was to see Wilder do Hitchcock better than Hitchcock ever could! The set-up is this - Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is an inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions to market. He befriends a wealthy older woman, one Emily French. She is obviously flirting with him, and Vole, though married, flirts back, his objective being that maybe she will financially back one of his inventions. Then disaster strikes. Emily French is found murdered. Vole is an obvious suspect because Mrs. French has just changed her will and left everything to Vole. There is circumstantial evidence pointing to Vole, and he says he knows nothing about the will. Enter barrister Sir Wilfred, the finest in England, whose doctor has told him he must quit work and go on a vacation because of his heart condition. Sir Wilfred talks to Vole, believes his story, and also talks to his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) who backs up Leonard's story but comes across as somewhat cold to her husband's peril. Sir Wilfred is convinced to take the case and agrees to retire upon this last trial. Past that I cannot tell you any details or I'll ruin it for you.Everyone in the cast performs masterfully. Especially charming is the interaction between Laughton's character and his nurse played by his wife of then 28 years, Elsa Lanchester. They go back and forth at each other with Nurse Pimsoll insisting that Sir Wilfred keep his rigid schedule of medications and him treating her like a jailer with hilarious one liners at the poor woman's expense. Only a long married couple could do this feature length banter so well. If Nightmare Alley didn't convince you that Tyrone Power was more than a pretty face, this film will. Likewise, Marlene Dietrich is much more than a blue angel and a fine figure of a woman at age 56.Notice all of the little touches. How Sir Wilfred seems to be ignoring testimony in court by counting out his pills, only to stand up and ask insightful questions when his turn comes. Plus this film really shows that nothing is off the record, even if the judge says that it is - the jury hears and sees everything. Sir Wilfred plays on that fact.Great acting, great direction, great story - it doesn't get any better than this. Thus I give this a solid 10/10. And one irony - Power's character mentions several times about Sir Wilfred's heart, but it is Tyrone Power himself who will be dead of a heart attack by the end of the following year. Sadly, this is his last completed film.",Witness for the Prosecution

35,HotToastyRag,One of the best courtroom movies of all time,9,16 April 2018,"Witness for the Prosecution is one of the most entertaining courtroom stories of all time, written by the crime mistress herself, Agatha Christie. Charles Laughton completely owns the courtroom, starring as a famously brilliant barrister who's supposed to be taking a break for his health-but he gets drawn in by a truly compelling murder trial. Tyrone Power, in his last movie, has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. While all the evidence racks up against him, Charles doesn't give up hope and tries to win the case, all the while trying to crack the very hard nut Marlene Dietrich. Marlene is Tyrone's wife, and it's impossible to tell what she's really thinking or feeling.I love this story, and I love both versions of the film, from 1957 and 1982. It's incredibly suspenseful and interesting-and also quite impossible to talk about without giving spoilers. If you've never seen Witness for the Prosecution, add this one to your list of classics to rent. The acting is fantastic, and the timing makes it a very entertaining old movie to watch.

36,The_Void,Another triumph for cinematic genius Billy Wilder!,8,3 February 2005,"Billy Wilder is a director with an understanding of cinema that is almost unmatched throughout the medium's entire history - that's why his films are always so good. Witness for the Prosecution is yet another highlight in the great director's history, and it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting and a great opportunity for some first rate comedy. Wilder's film features one of the most well paced plots I've ever seen in a film, and it's a plot that includes some very finely tuned twists. Towards the end, Wilder bombards us with twist after twist, each one both making sense and topping the one before it. In a time when people are impressed by films such as 'The Sixth Sense', Billy Wilder still shows us how to skilfully attribute a twist into a film's plot. The plot itself follows the story of Sir Wilfrid Robarts; an ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health won't allow him to tackle anything more than mundane cases, but is brought back into the fray when a case involving the murder of an elderly woman comes into his hands. Wilfrid must now juggle the case and his health as he attempts to keep the young man from being sent down.Like all Wilder films, this one is a very pleasurable viewing. Wilder manages to find a middle ground between substance and entertainment, and so this is a film that will please fans of both aspects. The film is deliriously entertaining throughout, with some truly great lines of dialogue (most of which is very quotable) and every twist adds a new level to the story. The substance comes from a multitude of angles, and themes of love, health, sacrifice and most notably, justice, are all more than prevalent. The acting is certainly of note in Witness for the Prosecution. Charles Laughton is absolutely sublime as the undermining and stubborn Wilfrid Robarts; his performance is very strong, and makes up the backbone of the film. The main supporting performance comes from Marlene Dietrich. I'm not a big fan of hers; despite having a great pair of legs, she just doesn't do anything for me, but in this film she brings sufficient coldness to her character and really makes it her own. The final main performance comes from Tyrone Power; he isn't as great as the other two, but does enough with his character to ensure he's believable. Highly recommended viewing!",Witness for the Prosecution
37,zetes,"Ridiculously overrated, but Laughton and Lanchester are excellent",6,1 November 2003,"Typical of Billy Wilder films, Witness for the Prosecution is mediocre and overrated. I don't know how his fans defend him so passionately. Sure, he made a few great films, but looking at this courtroom drama, one of his more popular films, how can anyone deny how hackneyed, predictable, and often just how plain stupid it is? I hate courtroom dramas, but this one is particularly laughable in its depiction of courtroom activities. Fortunately, it does contain two brilliant performances by Charles Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester. Laughton plays the lawyer who defends alleged murderer Tyrone Powell (in his last performance, and what must be one of his worst). He has recently suffered a heart attack, and is advised to take it cool for a while. Elsa Lanchester is his pesky nurse. Their chemistry recalls their great performances in The Private Life of Henry VIII from a quarter of a century earlier. These two keep this sinking ship of a movie from becoming totally sunk. In fact, with the clever twist at the end, I was almost ready to say I liked it; the three good points, Laughton, Lanchester, and the twist made the film a somewhat pleasant waste of time. But then there is a second twist which is utterly forced and utterly idiotic, so my final verdict must be a slight disapproval. Still, if you haven't seen it, Laughton and Lanchester are worth the time. 6/10.",Witness for the Prosecution
38,christopher-underwood,many a wondrous twist to a seemingly simple tale,8,10 April 2019,"I was rather surprised to discover just how good this is, not quite the masterpiece that is Double Indemnity but surely preferable to the rather stiff Sunset Boulevard. Based upon an Agatha Christie short story and play, it was suggested to Wilder by Marlena Deitrich and he developed it with great skill, beefing up the role to be taken (over!) by Charles Laughton and introducing the notion of his recent heart attack and need for accompanying nurse, providing a fine role for Elsa Lanchester. Laughton is fantastic and clearly prevented from going over the top by the director, Tyrone Power is perfectly adequate in this his final film and Dietrich looks very good and tries very hard but is one of those actors who just does it and you either like it or don't. Didn't get the feeling Wilder has much say over her interpretation but it still works. it works because the director has such a grip on the whole and as he himself has said the Christie construction is so sound.

39,DKosty123,An Extra Spoiler To Ponder - Via A Dame Christie Short Story,8,18 February 2009,"There is a lot of good in this movie. Billy Wilder is at the top of his game directing. Charles Laughton gives an outstanding performance as the main Defense Lawyer. Tyronne Power has a good but somewhat constrained performance as the screen is only so big. Marlene Dietrich is excellent too. This film is loaded with fine performances. With John Williams & Elsa Lanchester heading up a loaded support cast, this film is extremely well done. Based on a short story as quite a lot of excellent films of the golden era of the 1950's were, it had a promotional gimmick of not telling anyone how it ends. In a way, Hitchcock would twist this promotion 3 years later with a Psycho promotion that once the film started, no one would be allowed to leave the theater. While this isn't Psycho, it is a very good film. Wilder entertains an audience which he does very successfully here. After watching the film, the script has one ending which is quite obvious and in a way a Hitchcock type of ending involving another murder at the end of the film. I wonder if they had tried another one, how it would have been received?My extra spoiler- Dietrich is accused of perjury in the trial. Another ending that would not have been as exciting is the fact that all the evidence revealed at the end of the movie revealed that she never commits perjury at all. Everything she said in the trial is the truth.

The film adroitly transforms a typical whodunit plot to a more direct and pungent question, did he do it or not, and thanks to Wilder's erudite writing and directing skills (a noteworthy excellence, apart from the solemn and fierce verbal battle inside the courtroom, is the incessant humorous squabbles between Charles Laughton and Elisa Lanchester, his nurse in the film and wife in the real life), plus Christie's elaborate effort as the original playwright, the film per se is a quintessential testimony that films could be so deadly enticing and mind-blowing. The cast is simply sterling, with Charles Laughton painstakingly tackles with the cutthroat murder case and his ailing health hurdle, never be fools by his paunchy image, his astute faculty of playing to the score in court and sublime articulacy is the ace in the hole. A more glamorous pair, Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich, both is their latter days (for Dietrich, it stands for her acting career, however for Mr. Power, tragically, it showcases his last flair on screen, he would die one year after in a heart attack during shooting SOLOMON AND SHEBA 1959). Thanks to the magic of B&W texture, it is so shocking to know Ms. Dietrich was in her 50s while shooting this film, I hate to admit this is only her second film I've watched after STAGE FRIGHT (1950, a 7/10), her queenly demeanor dominates each frame she is in with an one-of-a-kind vibe which could easily conquer each and every audience. And Mr. Power, rarely being hailed or honored for his acting capacity other than his gorgeous mien, finally leaves a memorable performance to end his untimely life. The only hiccup of the film, for me at least, is the ending, which seems too rash to culminate in the climax, Wilder is not rational enough to throw the curtain call in such a rush, nevertheless it is riveting still. The film secured 6 Oscar nominations without winning (including BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST ACTOR and BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS), gratifyingly, it lost to THE BRIFGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (1957), which reminds me there is another candidate on my must-see list and with fellow nominees like 12 ANGRY MEN (1957, 9/10), one have to admit, 1957 is a vintage year for Hollywood film industry!",Witness for the Prosecution
41,sddavis63,The Best Courtroom Drama I've Ever Seen,9,19 July 2008,"Charles Laughton (surely one of the finest actors who has ever lived) put on an absolutely superb performance in this movie as the aging and well known defense attorney Wilfrid Robarts, who is hired to defend a man accused of murdering an elderly widow he had befriended in order to gain her estate. Laughton manages to combine comedy (he's at times very funny, particularly in his exchanges with his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester) with great drama and he does it seamlessly; everything about this movie flows absolutely perfectly. His client is Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Powers.) Powers also seemed to me to capture the essence of his character - sleazy looking enough to make you wonder if he's guilty, but also angst ridden enough to make you doubt that he's guilty. Of the main actors, I wasn't especially taken by Marlene Dietrich as Vole's wife Christine. I haven't seen a lot of Dietrich's work, but from what I have seen I have to confess that she's never really turned my crank; she's no different here. Something about her performance (here and in other bits of her work that I've seen) just comes across as artificial. I can't explain it any better than that. Having said that, one performance that to me was sub-par (and her performance here probably suffers mostly in comparison with Laughton and Powers) can't detract from an excellent courtroom drama that keeps you guessing right up to the very end. The last twenty minutes or so especially are full of so many twists and turns that your head is spinning by the time it's over. I also appreciated the look at the inside of a British courtroom and its procedures, since most of the courtroom dramas I've seen are American. (As an aside, it was interesting to see Ian Wolfe as Robarts' valet Carter. Wolfe had a very long career in movies and television, never from what I can remember as a star, but as a supporting actor or guest star in everything from great movies such as this to TV shows like ""Star Trek"" or ""WKRP in Cincinnati."" What was most interesting about him was that from the time this movie was made in 1957 to his later work in TV he doesn't seem to change. He's immediately recognizable.) As for this movie, it's a truly excellent piece of work. 9/10",Witness for the Prosecution
42,StrictlyConfidential,Laughton's Shtick Made Me Sick,4,23 July 2018,"This 1957 courtroom drama of ultimate treachery and betrayal was frequently spoiled for me by that sniveling, pompous actor, Charles Laughton, who played the ""Sir"" Wilfred Roberts character.IMO - Laughton (and his insufferable blubbering) was given way-way too much screen-time. And I sure got real sick of his shtick - Real fast.As expected - Marlene Dietrich gets to do her trademark ""man-drag"" thing, once again, in this picture. You know, I think that she has been given the chance to do this same, tiresome business in at least a third of all the films that she has ever appeared in.*Note* - This would be Tyrone Power's final film. He died of a heart attack the following year after its release. He was 44 at the time.",Witness for the Prosecution
43,theowinthrop,The Best of the Pre - 1970s Agatha Christie films?,10,2 February 2006,"After the artistic success of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, the only notable film based on Dame Agatha Christie's stories was a remake of LOVE FROM A STRANGER with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney as the ill-matched couple, but re-staged in the 1890s rather than 1930 England. Then, in 1957, Billy Wilder made this production of a short story by Dame Agatha called WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. With a tip-top cast of Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power, and Elsa Lancaster, the film was a brilliantly done version of Christie's short story, changed in it's ending (but to a changed ending found in Christie's own dramatization). Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is a salesman who meets an elderly, wealthy woman (Norma Varden) and gains her affections - much to the dislike and mistrust of her servant (Una O'Connor). O'Connor claims she saw the two together the night that Varden was beaten to death in her apartment. Vole is arrested, and his solicitor (Henry Daniell) wants England's best barrister, Sir Wilfred Robarts (Laughton) to defend him. Robarts is recovering from a heart attack, and is being nursed by Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster). He is a difficult patient, and is not looking forward to an enforced rest in Bermuda. So, despite the protests of Plimsoll he takes the case. He does promise her he will listen to his doctor and take his medicine. She does not trust him. Sir Robert meets Vole's German born wife, Christina Helm (Dietrich), who alarms him. She is too cool, to detached at her husband's peril. But he goes ahead, and is soon in court fighting a first rate opponent (Torin Thatcher as Myers), and scores some impressive points against the prosecution, especially in cross-examining O'Connor. But at the critical moment he finds that by a subtle point of law, Dietrich can testify against Power, and does so. So the plot becomes, how to defeat this ""witness for the prosecution""? Is there something that can turn the tables on her and her testimony.And the evidence to use against Dietrich does appear - from an unexpected source. Is it effective? Will Power be saved in the end? Or is there something going on?Although the conclusion of this film has been pretty well known for years, I will refrain from explaining what it is. A good mystery should surprise the audience, as this does every audience that sees it for the first time. Laughton and Lancaster make a funny pair (and in the end, an endearing one from Lancaster's point of view). Power gets to play his most sinister part since ""the Great Stanton"" Carlyle in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. And Dietrich does pull off the biggest surprise twist in her career. As for Wilder, after some questionable films in the mid 1950s (THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS) he was back in form. His handling of the courtroom scenes (which make up nearly 60% of the film) are far more realistic and speedy than Alfred Hitchcock's plodding THE PARADINE CASE a decade earlier. It was the best of the Christie films prior to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.",Witness for the Prosecution
44,sol-kay,You have made a mockery of English Justice!,8,8 January 2007,"***SPOILERS****Recovering from a near-fatal heart-attack British barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, Charles Laughton,is under doctor's orders to keep away from being involved in anything stressful like defending a client facing the death penalty. As soon as Sir Wilfrid is back in his London law office he's faced with what he's told, by his doctor and colleagues, to avoid a man on trial for his life and against his, and those working for him, better judgment Sir Wilford takes the case.Agreeing to defend Leonard Vole, Tyrone Power, in the murder of Emily French, Norma Varden, a lady friend of his Sir Wilfrid feels certain that Vole is telling the truth in that he had nothing to do with Mrs. French's murder. It's that Vole is so open to where he was at the time of her murder by him being at home with his German-born wife Christine, Marlena Dietrich. There's also the fact that he was never arrested or served time for anything of a criminal nature in his life. Vole in fact even did admit that he knew Mrs. French and was at her home a number of times trying to get her to finance a new egg-beater that he invented and was only on the best terms with her. So why would he murder her unless it was a crime of passion which was very unlikely for the happily married Leonard Vole.At the trial things suddenly start to go a bit sour for Vole in that he was in Mrs. French's will giving him most of her saving some 80,000 pound sterling! Mrs. French housekeeper Mrs. McKenzie, Una O'Connor, also throws a wrench in the defenses wheels to get Vole off by saying that she heard him and her late employer Mr. French have a violent augment just minutes before she found her dead in the living room. Sir Wilfrid easily dismisses Mrs. McKenzie's accusations by showing the judge and jury that she's very hard of hearing so how could she have overheard Vole and Mrs. French arguing with the door to the living room, four inches of thick oak wood, shut tight. There's also the fact that Mrs. McKenzie didn't receive the 80,000 pound sterling, that she felt that she deserved, was a good reason for her to want Vole to get, what she feels, what so rightfully deserves life imprisonment or even worse, or better, the rope.The big surprise at the trial is when Vole's loving wife Christine suddenly shows up to be a witness for the prosecution against her husband. Christine totally contradicts the story that she told Sir Wilfrid about Vole being at home with her when the crime was committed. Christina's testimony put her husband at the scene of the crime and even worse he actually told her that he in fact did kill Mrs. French. There's also the fact that Christine wasn't legally married to Vole, she was still married to a German national, which made it legally possible that she could testify against him.Stunned that he's somehow being set up to take the fall, through the gallows trapdoor, by Christine and whoever he thinks she's involved with, her lover?, the betrayed and emotionally drained Volve almost has a breakdown right in the courtroom. With lawyer Sir Wilfrid being left with no one to contradict Christine's utterly damaging testimony it's all but a forgone conclusion that his client Leonard Vole will be convicted of first degree murder. Just when everything seems lost for the defense an unexpected surprise witness turns up who not only has the goods on Christine, in proving that she lied under oath, but also has a score of love letters in Christine's handwriting, to her secret lover Max, showing the real reason why she's railroading her confused and befuddled husbands neck straight into the hangman's noose.The movie has a number of wild and unexpected surprises in it that culminates with the mother of all surprise endings as well as double-crosses that just about blows everyone, most of all the just recovered heart-attack victim Sir Wilfrid, away. Almost speechless at what transpired before his own eyes Sir Wilfrid in effect unknowingly gave those who later engineered this outrage of the British justice system. Sir Wilfrid gave them that idea by bringing up how unrealistic and dangerous it would be to Vole's chances of being found innocent with his wife testifying in his favor which in effect, by some strange and convoluted reason, lead her to testify against him!The surprise witness who engineered the mind boggling ending of the movie and convinced the jury and everyone else in the courtroom of Vole's obvious innocence in Mrs. Frenchs murder was not the biggest surprise in the film. The really big one was saved after the trial was over and it was that what made the movie the both shocking and effective as well as the financial and critical success that it turned out to be.",Witness for the Prosecution
45,Lejink,Centre Court Love Match,7,9 October 2019,"I like Hitchcock's story that members of the public later believed that he and not Billy Wilder had directed this grand, suspenseful courtroom drama based on Agatha Christie's successful stage play. Perhaps one could imagine Hitch making slightly more of the climactic scenes in the courtroom both as and after the verdict is brought in but I doubt he could have got much better performances out of old stagers Laughton and Dietrich as maestro Wilder conjures here.I gather that the original play was staged entirely in the courtroom requiring Wilder to open out the action and let some air into the slightly fustian drama. I agree with those who believe that Tyrone Power's Leonard Vole character should have been played by a younger actor, especially when at one point it's mentioned that Deitrich's character, as his wife, is much older than him. It probably didn't help that Marlene herself was fresh out of plastic surgery and also employing ""tape lifts"" to pull her skin tighter to make her appearance seem younger. I also found Power's playing to be a bit on the melodramatic side although one could argue that this was required of his part as an important element in his scheming.Given the Christie connection and the famous publicity at the time about cinema audiences being sworn not to reveal the ending, I must admit I was always trying to get ahead of the action and while I did get guess the main plot twist, I must admit I didn't detect either the means by which it was carried out or the immediate aftermath of the revelation at the film's climax.Tautly directed by Wilder and with excellent star turns by Laughton and Deitrich, (who almost inevitably is contrived to show just one of her legs, I wonder was it in her contract?) with a fair smattering of leavening humour between Laughton and his real life wife Elsa Lanchester who plays with relish the part of his fussy nurse (just get a load of those Bermuda shorts!), this was fine, if slightly old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, certainly if you compare it to the likes of contemporary films by directors like Kazan, Zinnemann or Preminger. There are no cinematic boundaries being pushed here (compare it to Preminger's courtroom drama ""Anatomy Of A Murder"", for example) just solid film-making by all concerned and to paraphrase Paul McCartney's song, what's wrong with that.",Witness for the Prosecution
46,ElMaruecan82,A school-case of emotional manipulation to misguide perceptions ...,9,19 November 2012,"Accused of the murder of a wealthy old woman, Leonard Vole, played by a charismatic Tyrone Power, faces an imminent death sentence by hanging. His wife, Christine Helm, Marlene Dietrich as sophisticated as ever, stands on the witness box, not to defend her husband, but like the title suggests: as a ""Witness for the Prosecution"". After her testimony, Vole's life hangs by a thread and only because his lawyer is the flamboyant and redoubtable Sir Wilfrid, we want to believe he has a chance to get himself through.Yet all the evidence are against him, blood stains, fingerprints, the deposition of Mrs McKenzie, a grouchy little servant played by a scene-stealing Uma O'Connor, an ill-chosen visit to a travel agency with a ""clinging brunette"" one week before the murder, contradicting his description as a penniless man, but making all sense if he knew that he would inherit 80000 pounds from the victim. And the deathblow comes when his own wife deprives him from the only alibi that could have saved his head: she tells that he came after the time of the murder and much worse, that he asked her to lie to the police. At that point, we deal with an open-and-shut case, Vole is hopeless and pathetic, and Christine is cold but unflappable. And as one of Wilfrid's assistant says: ""the jurors don't like her but believe her, they like Vole, but don't believe him"".The only reliable tactic is to prove Christine wrong. Smoothly but surely, Wilfrid conducts the jury into that conclusion. Christine Helm lied when she told Vole she was single after the War, so she could marry him and go to London, she lied under the oath of matrimony, she lied to the police after the murder, why would the jury believe her now? Yet, as a real German, she remarkably resists the pressure and literally gives the rope that would hang Vole. The case is desperate, with no substantial evidence against her testimony, Wilfrid, who believes his client is innocent, will lose. The same night, he receives a phone call from a woman who has the proof of Christine's motive to lie to the Court: love letters for a mysterious Max. Wilfrid meets the woman in the train station, a weird foulmouthed brunette with a phony accent and personal reasons to hate Christine. And everything works impeccably with Christine admitting that she wrote the letters. After her breakdown, no one would ever believe that she told the truth, not even the prosecutor. Wilfrid brilliantly turns Vole's trial into Christine's, she had no sympathy to begin with and after that, she also lost credibility. But there's something bothering in the mysterious woman's intervention, it plays like a cheap Deus Ex Machina device, very unlikely from an Agatha Christie story or a Billy Wilder script, so we're ought to believe there's much more in the film to be revealed. Even Wilfrid, who's too intelligent not to sense the awkwardness says: ""It's a little too neat, too tidy, and altogether, too symmetrical.!!"" But at ten minutes away from the conclusion, the film is about to reveal the genius of its script, and how it fooled us by fooling a supposedly clever character.All the elements of greatness reassemble at the end, and justify the film's honorable position on IMDb and it's ranking among AFI's Top 10 courtroom dramas. The over-the-top acting by Power and Dietrich takes its full meaning, because they're playing characters supposed to be play, had they been natural, it would have been less believable. And our perceptions in terms of sympathy are immediately reversed after the climactic revelation, the sneaky liar is the most remarkable loving wife, the wrongly accused guy is a real bastard. ""Witness for the Prosecution"", like some of the best courtroom dramas, provides a perfect example of emotional manipulation in order to misguide perceptions. While the jury wouldn't believe the testimony of a loving wife, the solution was to make an accusation against Vole to better invalidate it. In my recent review of ""The Life of David Gale"", I described a similar case when, in 2004, there was a vast controversy surrounding Bush' military service, yet the documents used by his adversaries were proved to be false. The accusation was still valid, but since the opponent lost all his credibility and apologized about it, Bush won by default. And I wondered whereas the Bush side gave the documents or not, this would have been one hell of a strategy: starting a controversy to better discredit it. This inspired many courtroom dramas, such as ""David Gale"" or even ""Primal Fear"", it served Bush so well that I guess if I ever cheated on my wife, all I would have to do would be to send to the accusers some pictures and them prove them to be fake. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is the best film about manipulation of evidence, because Billy Wilder doesn't take for granted the build-up and the climactic revelation, he enriches the script with witty exchanges, and a wonderful lead character, through Charles Laughton as a barrister who is recovering from a heart attack and is nursed by Mrs. Pillsom, played by Elsa Lanchester. Their interactions, in fact, the whole convalescence subplot creates a charming comedy feeling contrasting with the darker undertones. And Laughton is so superb that ha carries the whole movie alone, before Dietrich and Power reveal how they deliberately fooled him, and manipulated the British Law's specific procedures for malevolent purposes. But Wilfrid and the Law are quickly avenged by an ironic twist of fate, when Christine kills Vole, when he shows up with the infamous ""clinging brunette"".But according to Wilfrid, it's not a killing, but an execution. Christine was only the tool of an immanent Justice, more valuable and sacred than the Law itself. No wonder he decides to defend her, in one of these unforgettable endings like only Billy Wilder can make.",Witness for the Prosecution

48,ThomasDrufke,Nothing But the Truth,9,30 June 2015,"I feel like once I think I'm done seeing all of the Billy Wilder classics, I come across yet another masterpiece. Witness for the Prosecution proves once again why Wilder is one of the all time great directors, and probably right alongside Hitchcock as the best in the golden age of Hollywood. It's not full of action or really any heart stopping thrill rides, just some fantastic drama with incredible dialogue.Yes, it does feel very theatrical in film form. But it works to it's benefit for the most part. I think what separates a bad theatre adaptation from a great one is the attention to detail that the actors give. Charles Laughton gives an all time memorable performance as Sir Wilfrid, the main lawyer in the infamous case. The film is also one of Wilder's most meticulously woven story lines. I don't the play very well but the story is full of twists and turns that I did not expect to the least. It's a credit to the actor's performances that I consistently went back and forth whether I thought Leonard was guilty or not. It's also one of those court crime dramas that I believe to be timeless. I know a lot of people believe that black and white pictures are much harder to watch or just older films in general, but I think this is one where you got lost within the story and forget when the film was even released or that it's black and white.I also give this film credit for dealing with mostly older actors and actresses. I think the 50's were consistently criticized for relying on younger actresses to compete with the older actors in various films. But Marlene Dietrich was the only actresses that could be considered young and yet she was 56 during filming. It was just nice to see the roles being played by the best actors and actresses. Overall, I was very pleased with the film and everyone involved in the making of it.

50,secondtake,"Great story, and great lively acting...what else is there?",8,4 April 2012,"Witness for the Prosecution (1957)Billy Wilder is one of the three or four really great directors coming out of post-war Hollywood. ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Sunset Blvd"" and even ""The Apartment"" are flawless films. Flawless and brilliant, visually flashy, inventive, and touching. And Wilder was more prolific as a writer than a director, and in ""Witness for the Prosecution"" there is less of the cinematic genius and more of the literary one. He had one of the great popular storytellers of Britain of the time at his side, too--Agatha Christie. In fact, it's an expanded version of one of her stories. Some of the repartee between the leading lawyer, played by Charles Laughton, and his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester, is especially funny when you know they were married at the time.The other great actress here of course is Marlene Dietrich, who is cold and clever and virtuosic. They even have a flashback so she can play, twenty-five years after the fact, the kind of entertaining role she was known for in the days of Josef von Sternberg (as in ""The Blue Angel""--the little nightclub in ""Witness"" is even called the Blue Lantern). The key to the whole story is the plot, which is smart and believable. The acting is lively, and the whole enterprise is far funnier than you'd expect (even the judge is witty). There are twists and then more twists. If the camera-work isn't Billy Wilder's best, it is still fluid and functional. (We can't blame the cameraman, the brilliant Russell Harlan, who did any number of visually astonishing movies, like ""Gun Crazy,"" for starters.) As much as this is a very British seeming film, and of course Christie is very British in her material and style, the whole enterprise was filmed in California. You'll never know it, however.

And I will no divulge any secrets about the final act here.The story comes from the great mystery writer Agatha Christie. Billy Wilder co-wrote the screenplay and directed the film. This pedigree should be the first clue that ""Witness for the Prosecution"" might be a superior film. And it is.The story starts out simply enough. Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who is recuperating from a heart attack, is a cantankerous gent who disobeys his doctor's wishes at every turn. On his first day back at work, a murder case is dropped in his lap. Though he tries to push it off on others, he gets drawn into the defense of Leonard Vole.Vole is an American accused of murdering a widow for her money. The evidence is just circumstantial. And Vole's wife, Christine--who he met in Germany during the war--will testify that he was with her during the time of the murder. But is Christine a good witness? Wilfrid's interview with her suggests otherwise, mostly due to her Teutonic coolness.The cast of the film is superb. Charles Laughton brilliantly plays Sir Wilfrid. His wife, Elsa Lanchester, plays his nagging nurse Miss Plimsoll, adding a comic touch to the proceedings. Vole is played by Tyrone Power. Trivia notes on IMDb say that Billy Wilder preferred William Holden. While watching the film, Holden came to mind a few times when watching Power. Maybe the screenplay was somewhat groomed for Holden? But Power nails the character anyway. Christine is played by Marlene Dietrich.This is one of the great courtroom dramas. Although there are a few inconsistencies or stretches of believability in the film, they are extremely minor and did not distract me from the story. There are a few clues cleverly hidden throughout the film. When you go back over the film later, these hold together very well.",Witness for the Prosecution

Dietrich has one of her best roles as his wife, a woman of mystery. However, the film belongs to Laughton. With his cynical delivery, wry smile, and sparkling eyes, the great actor has a field day as the cagey lawyer hired to defend Power. Lanchester (Laughton's real life wife) is hilarious as the pesky nurse assigned to look after Laughton as he recovers from a heart attack.",Witness for the Prosecution
56,clanciai,Charles Laughton coming to terms with Marlene Dietrich over the scoundrel Tyrone Power,9,30 June 2017,"This is actually a comedy, and its artificial intrigue and superficiality is all too transparent for anyone to be able to take it seriously. Yes, it's a murder trial, and murder is dead serious, especially since the punishment in 1952 still was death by hanging, but there are too many flaws in this case to make it credible at all. For example, if Tyrone Power didn't kill her, who did? No other candidate is ever presented, except a fabricated hypothesis of a possible thief, who anyway didn't rob anything, while the broken window clearly wasn't smashed from the outside for a break-in. The prosecutor fails to make this apparent conjecture clear as the absurdity it is and is all the way dwarfed by Charles Laughton as the lawyer.Agatha Christie was a very skillful writer, all her intrigues are logical and water-tight, but they are all superficial constructions. In comparison with Hitchcock's one great murder trial film. ""The Paradine Case"" (see my review) which is thoroughly organic all the way with very clearcut and convincing characters, each one humanly crippled by his own weakness, this one becomes no more than an entertainment. It is even regularly funny. Billy Wilder made some of the best films of Hollywood in his time, but at the same time all his films suffer from some non-convincing artificial superficiality. He is very seldom serious and can rarely be taken seriously, never in his later films, perhaps in his early ones, especially his maybe best film ""Stalag 17"" (see my review).Anyway, the film is exciting and enjoyable all the way, although they scream too much at court, also this is not very realistic, and the most enjoyable acting is between Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. His wife Elsa Lanchester adds as usual a very personal touch to the comedy. It's well worth seeing again after some decades for its great entertainment value, but there are certainly more interesting murder cases on film, especially Hitchcock's very underestimated ""Paradine Case"".",Witness for the Prosecution
57,briancham1994,Thrilling legal drama,8,26 August 2021,"This film is a great testament to the power of passionate acting and a delicately crafted script. Charles Laughton really steals the show as a boisterous old man with a zeal for his job. The interactions between his character and his nagging colleagues were hilarious, reminiscent of a petulant child. The progression of the plot reveals the backstory of the murder very carefully, giving the viewer enough details to guess the answer but giving enough twists to keep them on their toes!",Witness for the Prosecution
58,Thanos_Alfie,Prosecution...,8,4 February 2015,"""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a mystery movie in which we have a man who is arrested on suspicion of murdering an elderly acquaintance. So he employs an experienced and a bit weird barrister as his defense attorney to save him. After this things are getting really strange and the situation more and more complicated.I really liked this movie because of the very well written plot by Agatha Christie and because of the direction which had been made by Billy Wilder who tried really hard to fulfill the expectations which Agatha Christie set. I also liked perfect interpretation of Charles Laughton who played as Sir Wilfrid and he was simply outstanding. Another good interpretations that had to be mentioned are Tyrone Power's who played as Leonard Vole and Marlene Dietrich's who played as Christine Vole. In addition to this I believe that the selection of the cast was really good and their interpretations were brilliant.Lastly I have to say that ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a must see movie for all the people because when you watch this movie you can not believe what is going on and what to expect. Also this movie combines really well mystery and crime with drama. This movie has much of suspense and the twists are really unexpected, that's something that makes this movie unique.",Witness for the Prosecution

He is taking a murder case against the advice of his doctor, and Tyrone Power is the accused (this was Power's last film, as he died during filming of Solomon and Sheba). Also in the cast is Marlene Dietrich as Power's wife, even holding her own in a flashback where she is required to pass for twenty years younger (and does so successfully thanks to her personality and some forgiving lighting).Laughton has the best lines and the best scenes, and is superb.

60,eddie_baggins,A hugely enjoyable courtroom thriller,8,24 June 2020,"Regarded as one of the best courtroom dramas and films of all-time, Billy Wilder's wildly successful adaptation of Agatha Christie's stage play of the same name is a devilishly well-written and performed dramatic thriller (with a underrated sense of dark humor) that remains to this day an unpredictable and inventive exercise in what can be achieved with minimal fuss but perfectly tuned directives.As is the case with many of Christie's more famed works, Prosecution centers its twisting and turning narrative around a larger than life central figure, here Charles Laughton's ailing barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts, who takes on a seemingly impossible too win case involving Tyrone Power's wannabe inventor Leonard Vole, who has been accused of murdering wealthy elderly statesman Emily French, a woman of whom he had struck up a friendship with in the months prior to her untimely demise.It's hard to put into words just how commanding and fun Laughton's turn is as the razor sharp but health affected Roberts, most famous for his string of showy performances and responsible for directing the genuine American classic The Night of the Hunter (his sole directional effort), Laughton is a tour de force throughout Prosecution.From moments where he is bickering with his long-suffering nurse or butler, through to moments where he plays cat and mouse games in the courtroom defending Vole against seemingly insurmountable odds, Laughton delivers one of the great turns of the era under the ever watchful eye of the incredibly consistent Wilder.Supported by Power and the feisty (and in one instance leggy) Marlene Dietrich as Vole's German wife Christine, who causes havoc for the films main protagonists, Laughton and his co-stars thrive under the guidance of Wilder who brilliantly adds energy and substance to the film that in the wrong hands could've become nothing more than a talk-heavy bore that failed to fire away from the world of stage.Wilder's understanding and treatment of the material ensures that not a single line of dialogue is wasted nor a scene takes place for seemingly no reason as Prosecution is constantly moving forward towards one of cinema's great final stretches, that at the time asked kindly of its audience members to keep tight lipped about the ending they had just seen to maintain the surprise for those still yet to partake in the courtroom revelations.There's no doubt that elements of the film feel dated in today's climates, with some certain scenes (particular those featuring Power) feeling a tad overplayed and some plot devices causing moments that will require a suspension of common sense judgement but overall Prosecution remains a film deserving of its standing in the film community and a feature unlikely to be bettered by any modern day treatments.Final Say -Thriving off Wilder's steady hand behind the camera and the hugely enjoyable performance of Charles Laughton in front of it, Witness for the Prosecution is a thrilling piece of classic film-making that remains a touchstone for courtroom thrillers to this day.4 stair lifts out of 5",Witness for the Prosecution
61,Red-125,They don't make them like that any more!,10,12 February 2007,"Witness for the Prosecution (1957), was directed by the great Billy Wilder. The film was adapted from a play by Agatha Christie.Tyrone Power plays Leonard Vole, a handsome opportunist married to a German refugee, played by Marlene Dietrich. Charles Laughton plays Sir Wilfrid Robarts, the greatest barrister in England.Sir Wilfrid is a sick man. He has just returned from the hospital. His blood pressure is a horrible 240/130, and he suffers from chest pain and shortness of breath. Sir Wilfred is under the care of Nurse Plimsoll, played superbly by Elsa Lanchester, in an Oscar-winning performance. Sir Wilfrid agrees to defend Vole, because he knows Vole is innocent of the murder of which he is accused. The circumstantial evidence against Vole is strong, and, against his doctor's orders, Sir Wilfrid decides to take the case.Laughton, Power, and Lanchester are extraordinary, but it is Dietrich that makes the film so memorable. Wilder has given her one of the great entrances in the history of cinema:Laughton: ""Oh, about Mrs. Vole. Handle her gently when you break the news of the arrest (of her husband). Bear in mind she's a foreigner so be prepared for hysterics and even a fainting spell. You'd better have smelling salts ready, a box of tissues and a nip of brandy.""Dietrich: ""I do not think that will be necessary. I never faint because I'm not sure I will fall gracefully, and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes. I'm Christine Vole.""They just don't make them like that any more.",Witness for the Prosecution
62,jzappa,"The Neat, Elegant Thriller We All Love",8,25 July 2007,"Witness For the Prosecution is a modest, meticulous, intelligent and analytical little Agatha Christie yarn with rich, interesting characters, eloquent arguments in and out of court, and a story pointing for you to look one way while it reaches for the light switch with the other arm, turning off the lights and making you scramble with curiosity and determination. It works beautifully the way the perfectly satisfactory mystery, caper, or crime should be organized. The film is strictly for the purpose of logically plodding through a very baffling murder case, and is devoid completely of emotion, because the film is not at all driven by its characters. It's all about the mechanics of the story and its twists, and thus the reactions of its characters. It's the perfect dry English mystery.Charles Laughton is the highest point of the film, the unlikely hero of the picture, an old and fat barrister with a rebellious disdain for his health and an unpleasant attitude. He is one of the most likable protagonists I've seen in quite awhile. Tyrone Power is brilliant, however, in a supporting role as the truly and completely befuddling defendant, who is simply the most unsure thing about the mystery as we weave through it nervously. He's wonderful. Marlene Dietrich, in her big role, plays a most interesting and provocative piece of the puzzle, yet her performance is as dry as a raisin. In any point where she shows any sort of emotion, facially she seems quite the same. I'd love to see what she's like when she witnesses a fatal car wreck. The same? But she is a great mood control, as Christie's story is a masterpiece of cold English guess-who.Wilder's direction is a careful change of step for him, a very clean and distanced piece of film-making. Feeling is given to pace, scenery, and story, but not a charged passion given to the people as well like with The Lost Weekend or Stalag 17. It's that neat, elegant thriller we all love to watch in a comfy chair in the living room with a blanket and a fire.",Witness for the Prosecution
63,Vartiainen,That ending,7,14 August 2017,"Originally a short story by Agatha Christie, which was then adapted into a play, which then served as the basis for this film. A down on his luck fellow named Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) befriends an elderly widow, who just happens to be loaded. She also happens to end up dead, with Leonard blamed for the murder. Enter one elderly barrister named Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), who has just gotten out of a hospital after a lengthy stay due to reasons of excessive lifestyle and bad habits. But, the case intrigues him, so he takes Mr. Vole as his client despite the protests of his nurse.Most of these courtroom dramas follow a fairly predictable pattern. Not that other genres don't have their conventions and clichés, but courtroom dramas rarely even try to hide them or shy away from them. With them the pattern is the point of it. You want the predictability, to a certain degree. You want to play along and try to guess the final outcome. Likewise with this film. Most of the running time is spent going over the case, reviewing past events, getting to know the characters.And it works. Charles Laughton especially is a blast. Sir Wilfrid is a wreck of a human being. Man consumed by vice. But then the case starts and his cunning intellect is suddenly at the forefront, his gaze unwavering and sharp.This was also Tyrone Power's last film. He would die during the filming of his next movie. But, as far as swansongs go, this is not a poor legacy to leave behind.But then, the main point of these films. The ending, when something is suddenly revealed. A key point of evidence is found, a new witness appears, someone cracks on the bench. I absolutely don't want to spoil anything, but the original story is by Agatha Christie. Trust me when I say it's wonderful.Witness for the Prosecution is a gem of its genre.

But, the whole film does not have too much qualities, in fact, it's boring, only talk with a surprise at the end.

65,bsmith5552,Superb Drama! Flawless Casting!,10,30 June 2007,"""Witness For the Prosecution"" is arguably one of the best courtroom dramas ever filmed. The Agatha Christie mystery was adapted from a stage play and directed with great expertise by the legendary Billy Wilder. The cast is impeccable right down to the smallest role.Solisitor Sir Wifred Robarts (Charles Laughton) is returning from convalescing from a heart attack along with his personal nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester) who denies him all the things he enjoys. Sir Wilfred has been ordered to take it easy and plans a long vacation.As luck would have it, Barrister Mayhew (Henry Daniell) arrives at Sir Wilfred's office with possible murder suspect Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) in tow. Mayhew pleads with Sir Wilfred to take the case but he resists. Sir Wilfred recommends his colleague Brogan-Moore (John Williams) to try the case. Vole's arrest is imminent.In flashbacks, we learn how Vole met the murdered woman, Emily French (Norma Varden) and courted her to win her favor and obtain ""a couple of hundred"" pounds to finance his latest invention. Vole it seems has been unable to hold down a job and seemingly preys upon lonely older women. We also learn of how Vole met his wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich) in Germany during WWII, married her and brought her to London.Vole is arrested and Sir Wilfred, against the protests of Miss Plimsoll and his assistant Carter (Ian Wolfe), decides to take on the case. Prosecuter Myers (Torin Thatcher) presents a strong case against Vole. Christina backs her husband's story. But suddenly the prosecution presents a final witness for the prosecution,,,,Christina who has unbeknown st to Sir Wilfred, agreed to testify against her husband. Ah, but is she really Vole's wife? Sir Wilfred presents only one witness for the defense...Vole himself. But with Christina's testimony, the case appears to be lost until...........................The last 15 minutes or so of the film present many unexpected surprises which I will leave for you to enjoy.The acting in this film is nothing short of incredible. Power and in particular, Dietrich and Laughton are all outstanding. Power as the beleaguered defendant gives one of his best performances. Dietrich, looking like a million bucks, proves that she was a much better actress than she was ever given credit for. Laughton though, steals the picture with his performance as the rumpled old solicitor for the defense. You're never quite sure that he will make it through the trial.Elsa Lanchester, who was married to Laughton, is good as the fussy old nurse and the marvelous Una O'Connor turns in another of her patented ""old hag"" performances. Others in the cast include Francis Compton as the judge and a very young Ruta Lee as a gallery spectator.The film received many Oscar nominations but was unfortunately up against ""The Bridge on the River Quai"" that year. Quai won the Best Picture and Alec Guiness the Best actor awards and deservedly so, but this film was also worthy of Best Picture and Power, Dietrich and Laughton also turned in Oscar worthy performances.If you've never seen this film, I highly recommend it. It hold up extremely well even 50 years after its initial release. And the ending, I envy you when you watch it for the first time.This was Tyrone Power's final film. He passed away the following year while filming ""Soloman and Sheba"" of a heart attack.An excellent film.",Witness for the Prosecution

67,ackstasis,"""I am constantly surprised that women's hats do not provoke more murders.""",8,19 December 2007,"Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that he often had fans approaching him to say how much they enjoyed 'Witness for the Prosecution (1957).' Knowing Hitch's wicked sense of humour, he probably would have gone along with it, but that doesn't change the fact that the film belongs to Billy Wilder, however reminiscent of a Hitchcock picture it might be. Adapted from a short story, and subsequently a play, by mystery author Agatha Christie, the film has a distinct theatrical feel to it, the story gradually unfolding mostly through dialogue, with the occasional important flashback. Just as 'Witness for the Prosecution' feels like the work of the Master of Suspense, it noticeably lacks the classy style of the actual director, with the confines of the courtroom drama perhaps unsuited to Wilder's trademark sparkling repartee {though Charles Laughton certainly gets in a few masterful wise-cracks}. Nevertheless, it is a genuinely thrilling and engaging mystery with an ensemble of terrific characters.Charles Laughton's Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an outrageously entertaining creation. Though having only recently recovered from a crippling heart attack, the attorney maintains a constant state of grumpiness, gruffly dismissing the well-meaning instructions of his insistent nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's wife, Elsa Lanchester). Though his health often causes him problems, and he hardly seems to be paying attention in the courtroom, Sir Wilfrid is the finest defence lawyer that the city has to offer, a shrewd and calculating legal genius, and a firm believer in the judicial process. When an agitated and seemingly-innocent young man, Leonard Steven Vole (Tyrone Power), is charged for the murder of an older lady friend (Norma Varden), our weary hero commits himself to proving the man's innocence in court, even though their chances of acquittal are seriously marred when the accused man's German ""wife"" (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against him.Much too often, time has ruined some of cinema's greatest twist-endings, and it always grieves me to have the finales of classic thrillers spoiled before I have the opportunity to watch them. In the case of 'Witness for the Prosecution,' I can happily say that I was caught completely off-guard, having not even been aware that the film contained a twist. Better yet, Agatha Christie manages, in the story's final moments, to cram in a quick succession of unexpected plot-turns, with the ending leaving us stunned and dazed, feeling as foolish and devastated as Sir Wilfrid must have been when he realised that he had just unknowingly rescued a certain murderer from punishment. Most definitely in the top five courtroom films I've ever seen, Billy Wilder's 'Witness for the Prosecution' is a different kind of classic for its legendary director, and a motion picture that, yes, I'm sure even Hitchcock would have loved.",Witness for the Prosecution

Outstanding!Most all modern movies that work twists into their story need to watch this film to learn how to not cheat the viewer by some out of left field twist but write an effective one that actually makes sense and has impact!This is 'just' a courtroom drama yet it is very well-crafted and well-written with an abundance of witty humor in a vibrant story. Even with lackluster cinematography it was engaging. The story kicks off with a husband who is accused of murder. He hires a plump, old defense attorney with his tag-along nurse as he keeps trying to sneak a nip of booze or a cigar as she tries to stop him. They were really entertaining. As the trial progresses, there is much deliberation and there is no surprise when Marlena Dietrich's character becomes the focal point to the story. I'll leave it there so if you enjoy well-acted and well-written courtroom dramas don't miss this one.

So I will obey and not give this away to anyone.

A lot of talented people were a part of this production of a Agatha Christie story & screenplay including Director Billy Wilder.

72,EUyeshima,Star Turns and Agatha Christie's Plot Twists Elevate Wilder's Witty Courtroom Drama,9,13 September 2008,"A labyrinth of deception is expected in an Agatha Christie mystery, and those unfamiliar with Billy Wilder's 1957 adaptation of the venerable writer's classic courtroom drama are in for a treat. Even if you already know how it all ends, there are still joys to be had from the star-studded cast and the master filmmaker's craftsmanship. Along with fellow screenwriters Larry Marcus and Harry Kurnitz, Wilder has imbued Christie's absorbing story with enough of his trademark humor to make the compelling film a genuine entertainment in the old Hollywood tradition. The plot centers on master barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who decides to take as a client Leonard Vole, an unemployed kitchen-gadget inventor who is charged with murder. Robarts is in ill health and must tolerate the constant pestering of Miss Plimsoll, a nurse assigned to make sure Robarts slows down and takes his medications. Through a trick he does with his monocle, Robarts believes Vole to be innocent of the charge of killing wealthy, lonely matron Mrs. French. Naturally, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that points to Vole being the killer.Enter Vole's cold German wife Christine, a former wartime chanteuse several years older than her husband and now his only alibi the night of the murder. The first surprising twist in the story occurs when Christine ends up playing the title role and kick-starts a series of revelations that lead to its somewhat unexpected conclusion. As Robarts, Charles Laughton has the best movie role of the latter phase of his lengthy career, displaying the character's sharp wit and cunning deductive skills with aplomb. His real-life wife Elsa Lanchester plays Miss Plimsoll with her familiar dotty manner and sing-song dithering. In his last completed role, Tyrone Power capitalizes on his seemingly effortless charm to play Vole but unfortunately tends to overact during key moments. Marlene Dietrich is ideally cast as the ambiguous Christine, showing off her legs in a wartime flashback and playing quite against character in the train station scene. You may be amused by a voice-over during the end credits that asks viewers not to reveal the surprise ending. A long trailer featuring Laughton is the only extra that comes with the 2001 DVD.",Witness for the Prosecution
73,ShootingShark,"Funny, Devious And Quick-Witted Courtroom Classic With Great Star Power",6,5 July 2007,"Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an ageing London barrister recently released from a recuperative stay in hospital. Defying his doctors, he takes on the case of Leonard Vole, a ladies man accused of murdering a spinster for her money. With no alibi, a choice motive, and Voles' own wife testifying against him, can Sir Wilfrid win the case before the strain kills him ?Based on a great play by Agatha Christie, this is one of three classic fifties courtroom dramas (the others being Anatomy Of A Murder and Inherit The Wind) with a cracking plot and a terrific cast. The histrionics - both real and fabricated - may be a bit extreme at times, but Power, Dietrich and especially Laughton are so perfectly matched to these characters that it doesn't matter. The supporting cast is full of wonderfully mad players, such as O'Connor (the housekeeper in Bride Of Frankenstein), Daniell (Garbitsch in The Great Dictator) and Williams (the Inspector in Dial M For Murder), but best of all is Laughton's real-life wife Lanchester as his long-suffering nurse, constantly bearing the brunt of his bilious spite - ""If you were a woman Miss Plimsoll, I would strike you."". In Wilder's capable hands, the comedy and the intrigue are beautifully balanced - the timeless Dietrich even gets to dress up as a Cockney scrubber in one scene and belt out a song in another. This is also a movie which piles clever twist upon clever twist into the last reel, a hugely influential technique which a lot of films have tried since but relatively few have managed to replicate with success.

Either a horribly aged once-perfect-looking Tyrone Power (with a gorgeous trophy in the wings played by Ruta Lee, pictured twice): he's accused of killing a rich old lady befriended for need of a loan on an egg-beating invention, or the title character in Marlene Dietrich, who gives the best performance overall, especially having to do with a twist that really only works in repose...Meanwhile, the always great acting team of Charles Laughton, as the flawed defense consul of the English Court, and real life wife-beard Elsa Lanchester, are only pretty good here, going back and forth more like another kind of stage play. Comedy, perhaps. Which simply doesn't fit here, and with everything mounting to the last five minutes, like mysteries do, this isn't one for rewatching: another major difference between Anatomy Of A Murder, a true classic that really needs a divorce from this otherwise semi-decent courtroom melodrama.",Witness for the Prosecution
75,davidmvining,Twisty fun with a bevy of winning performances,8,27 November 2019,"Billy Wilder and Agatha Christie, a match no one expected but was eminently welcome once it arrived. From Christie's stage play, Wilder created a fun, energetic, and rather unpredictable courtroom drama with wonderful characters, anchored by the great performance by Charles Laughton.Laughton plays Sir Wilfred Roberts, a barrister in London having just returned to work after suffering a heart attack. Tailed by his doting and nagging nurse, played by Laughton's real life wife Elsa Lanchester, Sir Wilfred is trying to get back to his old life of smoking, eating whatever he wants, and practicing criminal law, but everything is in his way. He can't sneak his cigars around, all his hiding spots are found out. His eating is tightly regimented. And his partners in his firm have allotted him only the most mundane of briefs from which to work.Salvation comes in the form of one Leonard Vole, a man soon to be accused of murder of an old lady he had grown acquainted with. One thing this movie does really well is the handling of flashbacks. It embraces it to tell the story of how Vole met Mrs. Emily Jane French. How he endeared himself to her with his egg beater invention, antagonized her maid with the same thing, and gained a certain comradery. We also see, in flashback, how Leonard and his wife Christine met in Germany after the end of the war (in what could almost be an extension of Marlene Dietrich's character's story from A Foreign Affair). And yet, that's where the flashbacks end. We never see the crime actually committed. We don't see dramatizations of people's testimonies in court, we only see the individuals give the testimonies.Wilder had to create a lot outside of the courtroom that wasn't in the original play, but he had this reputation of using source material as mere starting points instead of actual blueprints for his film. There was nothing stopping him from using flashbacks in the courtroom, but he didn't do it. I think it's because he understood how visual representations work within an audience's mind. If we see an event happening on screen, we're willing to believe it actually happened within the context of the story more than someone just speaking about an event. This is the secret to Rashomon's great artistic success (seeing the several stories instead of just hearing them).Anyway, the trial is full of the dramatic turns that one would expect from a Hollywood film built around a trial. There are last second reveals, witnesses, and evidence that pop up just in the nick of time. The standout is the cockney woman who brings Sir Wilfred to a dingy railroad bar where she hands him dozens of letters written by Christine to a lover who is not her husband. This new evidence is used to overcome Christine's harmful evidence given in court and free Leonard.Ah, but there are more twists to come! The final scene was clouded in secrecy. It changes the ending of the play, involves no one but our primary characters, and comes to a dramatic conclusion that's pretty difficult to predict. I do have a slight problem with this ending because Leonard essentially becomes another person once it begins, but that could be explained as him being a complete psychopath, which would fit the story well enough.The movie's a twisting and turning fun time with winning leads and very well written dialogue. Despite most of the film taking place on a single set, it never feels claustrophobic and moves with great speed.",Witness for the Prosecution
76,Spleen,"Agatha Christie is a classical detective story writer; arguably, THE classical detective story writer.",9,4 February 2001,"Let me explain.The best book on music I've ever read is ""The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven"", by Charles Rosen.  (Read it, it's fascinating.)  One of Rosen's claims is that the classical style was the offspring of two impulses: the desire to surprise, and the desire to be formally perfect, to sound ""right"".  In the decades before Haydn's maturity there were composers who startled and composers who satisfied; Haydn was the first to startle and satisfy in the same breath.Detective story writers have the same ideal as classical composers.  The solution must surprise us; yet the ""shape"" of the story, to those who know the solution, must be beautiful.  And, as in music, it's hard to surprise and satisfy at once.  If you must go one way or the other, much better to satisfy.  One can see the denouement of a Thorndyke story by R. Austin Freeman a mile off, but it's always perfectly crafted, and that is enough. Too many modern detective stories startle us by having the murderer turn out to be one of a dozen characters when it could so easily have been one of the other eleven and nobody would have particularly cared because there's little beauty in the story whoever it turns out to be.  But Agatha Christie ... not for nothing is she called ""classical"".  Her solutions are almost always surprising - she may have been better at misdirection than anyone else who ever lived - but they always, in a way that's hard to describe, make perfect dramatic sense.  -Okay, so she's not the world's best mystery WRITER.  But I often think she attracts undue criticism because she so obviously writes less well than she plots, while the literary defects of writers who can't plot either pass unnoticed.For all these reasons I'm surprised there aren't more first-rate films based on her works.  (I can understand, though, why ""The Mousetrap"" has never been filmed.)  Looking through the IMDb list of twenty-eight cinematic Christies, I'm surprised how many of the ones I've seen fall short of their potential. And twenty-eight isn't really, when you think about it, that many, especially when so many of them are remakes of earlier ones.Still, most are worth watching, and this particular one is excellent. Faithful to the play, it has the usual finely crafted, classical, Agatha Christie twist.  Wilder made it at a moment in his career when he could do no wrong.  It must have taken him all of two seconds to decide that Charles Laughton would make the perfect Sir Wilfrid; then, perhaps, another fifteen minutes to settle on Marlene Dietrich as the title character.  Just as ""Double Indemnity"" is set in a black-and-white California, ""Witness"" is set in a black-and-white England - it makes me wonder if it's a mistake filming Agatha Christie in colour.  You'll enjoy this, trust me.",Witness for the Prosecution
77,onepotato2,Witness to my eggbeater,2,3 December 2008,"A decent murder mystery is composed of A) unique perplexing crime, followed by B) a unique but insightful solution that allows C) a reconstructed throughline that isn't completely ridiculous. Ideally a smart viewer can play along and pick up clues to assemble the solution but it's not mandatory, and most mysteries from Sherlock Holmes to Sam Spade ignore that last merit. Most movies hope to wow you sufficiently with the solution that you don't go back and test it for believability.Mediocre mysteries always get one of the parts wrong, and it's usually item C. The correctly ordered universe when you piece it together is often silly and overextended beyond belief. And the explained universe is either of no special consequence or composed of absurd or impossible elements.The crime here is so trifling that it doesn't merit the solution or the elaborate smoke-screen. It's so utterly non-complex that one is starved in the end for a surprise/twist, and Christie half-heartedly obliges. Just who are these criminals who can't be bothered to waste an ounce of intelligence on preventing detection, but who stockpile oodles of criminal brilliance and subterfuge for their trial? On top of that, they chose an actress who couldn't pull off the dual role and had to be dubbed.Tyrone Power is looking way old here; too old to be playing a gigolo. Never did I imagine a movie with this title would concern itself with a failed egg-beater inventor... surely one of the most absurd characters ever written. There is no explanation for the generally high ratings this gets here. It's almost completely unremarkable. You can watch this in eleven segments on youtube.

78,Seraphion,All surprises are (or should really be) in the ending,6,13 January 2015,"The story nicely bring on a classic base of mystery of whether or not the client is guilty, the most often used premise of court movies. The movie nicely reveals the details one by one in an ordered manner, all the while having refreshing inserts of laughable remarks and mannerisms by Sir Wilfrid. What's really nice is that the details are placed so very neatly, scattered across the movie's duration, all the way up to the ending. Yet it must feel so very surprising in the times this movie was released. But today audiences are highly anticipative thus the placement and insertion tricks done in this movie will never work. The ending will have been spoiled at the very first appearance of Christine, especially if the audience marked closely on Leonard's description about her. The acting overall is just standard in my view. Tyrone Power didn't even bother to conjure up a decent British accent. Marlene Dietrich's emotion play may look astonishing at those old times but it sure is not now. The fact that she didn't change her voice, only her accent, when her character was supposedly under cover may well make the ending very predictable even for beginners to spot.",Witness for the Prosecution

Then, when you have seen it, come back and read whatever you want.Why? To say that this movie has a surprise ending is an understatement. The last half hour is one unexpected turn of events after the next, and everyone should be able to watch the movie once without knowing what is going to happen next.But even once you do, this movie remains fascinating. I watched it again tonight because it was on TCM and I stumbled across it, and because once I start watching it I don't want to stop. Even though I knew where it was going, the performances of the two leading actors, Laughton and Dietrich, are so good I just want to enjoy them again. Yes, Dietrich as the cockney woman is remarkable; I definitely did not realize it was she the first time I saw it. But though that may be the most remarkable part of Dietrich's performance, the whole thing is very good. Her way of carrying herself, her vocal inflections, certain turns of the head are all remarkable.As is Laughton's performance. Funny, angry, confounded, Laughton plays them all with brilliance.Yes, the first kudos go to the script: it's brilliant, and how it did not win an Academy Award I will never understand. But after that, Wilder's direction and the performances of Laughton and Dietrich make for a truly spellbinding performance. Even when you know what's coming, you still want to watch.-------------------I just watched this movie again, 19 February 2015. I can only repeat what I wrote above years ago, briefly: the last half hour are as good, as exciting, as enthralling as any movie ever made.

81,bkrauser-81-311064,Clearly One of Billy Wilder's Best,9,27 October 2013,"Ever since I was a teenager I still enjoyed the works of director Billy Wilder; I still do. Whether its Sabrina (1954), Sunset Blvd. (1950) or Ace in the Hole (1951), his dedication to quality is only eclipsed by his incredible versatility. In a career spanning just shy of fifty years, Wilder has done every genre under the sun from film noir to romantic comedy.In Witness for the Prosecution (1957), Billy Wilder takes a stab at the courtroom drama genre taking inspiration from the work of the esteemed Agatha Christie. Charles Laughton plays British barrister Sir Wilfred Robards a trial lawyer who recently suffered a serious heart attack. Told by his doctors to take it easy, Sir Wilfred's interests are peeked by a murder case brought forward by a friend. His decision to take the case is aided by the promise of cigars, brandy and a murder trial where things may not be what they seem. Tyrone Power costars as defendant Leonard Vole and Marlene Dietrich brings down the house as his wife aka the witness for the prosecution.Charles Laughton made quite an illustrious career for himself back in the day. Especially for someone who was never considered leading man material because if his unconventional appearance and girth. Not only was he an accomplished, award winning actor of the screen he was also an adept stage actor and director, starring in London and New York Shakespeare productions of MacBeth, Measure for Measure and A Midsummer Night's Dream.Laughton makes Witness for the Prosecution work. Period. Without him and his consistently wily, quick witted sense of humor, the movie's pacing would have relegated Wilder's masterpiece to Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) light. Laughton's chemistry with his overbearing nurse (played by real life wife Elsa Lanchester) provide brevity to the melodrama surrounding the case.The melodrama however comes in spades with Marlene Dietrich playing the defendants icy German wife. Dietrich is a vision of valkyrie beauty who presents herself as an untouchable beauty yet coils like a cobra every time she's under pressure. There is much under the surface of her character and while the last five minutes of the movie betrays her sensibilities, there is no one else who could have played the role with better aloofness and malice.As the credits role in Witness for the Prosecution, an telecaster announces no one should ruin the surprises and twists in the story for the sake of their friends. In that spirit I won't ruin anything for you. That being said the plot twists are rather Byzantine as they are unveiled to the audience and Sir Wilfred. It's not that the final reveals are unrealistic; its that they're not coaxed or prodded out but rather fall out of the movie like the truth out of a toddler.The works of Billy Wilder accurately portray the depth of his talent. He's one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented individuals of Hollywood's golden age. He worked with the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Jack Lemmon, Kirk Douglas, Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Stanwyck, and of course Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. If he were alive today he probably would have reinvented himself in the style of the blockbuster style. A Billy Wilder action-shot- em-up; now wouldn't that be the cat's meow.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Witness for the Prosecution

83,Takethispunch,Good thriller.,10,10 July 2016,"Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), a master barrister in ill health, takes on Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) as a client, despite the objections of his private nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester), who says the doctor warns him against taking on any criminal cases. Vole is accused of murdering Mrs Emily French (Norma Varden), a rich, older widow who had become enamoured with him, going so far as to make him the main beneficiary of her will. Strong circumstantial evidence points to Vole as the killer, but Sir Wilfrid believes Vole is innocent.When Sir Wilfrid speaks with Vole's German wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), he finds her rather cold and self-possessed, but she does provide an alibi. Therefore, he is greatly surprised when she is called as a witness for the prosecution. While a wife cannot testify against her husband, Christine was in fact still married to a German man when she wed Leonard (who was in the Army and part of the occupation forces in Germany). She testifies that Leonard admitted to her that he had killed Mrs French, and that her conscience forced her to finally tell the truth.During the trial in the Old Bailey, Sir Wilfrid is contacted by a mysterious woman who, for a fee, provides him with letters written by Christine herself to a mysterious lover named Max.

88,Terrell-4,"A highly skilled and professional movie, with four highly skilled and amusing performances",8,2 February 2008,"""I'll snatch her thermometer,"" snarls the aging, portly, brilliant, irascible London barrister Sir Wilfred Robarts, just back in his office after spending time in a hospital recovering from a heart attack, ""and plunge it between her shoulder blades!"" In Witness for the Prosecution, based on an Agatha Christie story and popular stage play, Sir Wilfred (Charles Laughton) is referring to his personal nurse and attendant, the chirpy and determined Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester). Sir Wilfred has strict instructions to give up everything he holds dearest, namely brandy, cigars and the excitement of criminal defense cases. Nurse Plimsoll is there to see that he does, as well as to give him his injections, make sure he swallows his pills and tuck him in for his afternoon naps. In an effort to sneak a cigar that first day back in his office, Sir Wilfred finds himself intrigued by the case of Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Vole is a charming, too charming, man whom we don't quite trust. He has been charged with murdering a rich, silly woman...who coincidentally changed her will in Vole's favor a week before her death. Vole stands to become a very wealthy man. There is means, motive and opportunity, and for Sir Wilfred, there is a challenge. Vole swears he's innocent, but his story is not altogether plausible. His only hope, and a shaky one it is, is the testimony of his German wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich). She has supplied an alibi, which cannot be verified, but at least she cannot be forced to testify against her husband. Then, when the marriage is found to be invalid, who should decide to become a witness for the prosecution? Sir Wilfred is mortified but even more determined to save his client. The case, full of startling twists, legal shenanigans, first-rate performances and vivid characters, ends with a typically Agatha Christie surprise. Some argue that Christie perhaps was weak as a writer, but peerless as a storyteller, able to construct mystery plot puzzles that consistently stumped her readers until the last chapter. With Billy Wilder directing and Wilder and Harry Kurnitz, an old pro, providing the screenplay, Christie once again gives a surprise twist that leaves us open-mouthed, yet smiling at her cleverness. Thanks to Wilder and Kurnitz, we also have a conclusion that involves Sir Wilfred and Nurse Plimsoll that is immensely satisfying. If only there had been a sequel. The four leads do marvelous jobs. In a way, the movie is about two relationships, not just one. There is the relationship between Vole and his wife. They met when Vole was a sergeant stationed in Germany right after WWII. He met Christine when she was earning money entertaining in a dive for soldiers. We see some of this in flashback. With Vole's opportunistic charm and Christine's cool manner, it's difficult to determine who, if either of them, is using whom, or to what degree love enters the picture. Christine's first entrance is memorable. Says Sir Wilfred to a group of fellows awaiting Mrs. Vole, ""Be prepared for hysterics and even a fainting spell. Better have smelling salts handy and a nip of brandy."" Then in walks Marlene Dietrich as Christine Vole, with perfect assurance. ""I do not think that will be necessary,"" she says to Sir Wilfred. ""I never faint because I am not sure that I will fall gracefully and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes. I am Christine Vole."" In the second relationship, Sir Wilfred and Nurse Plimsoll provide the acerbic and mutually bullying comic relief for the movie. The two actors, however, married in real life, manage to develop a touching inter-dependence. It's not just a smile they give as at the end, but also a modest lump in the throat. And personally, I was delighted to see Henry Daniell in a substantial secondary role. He plays Mayhew, the solicitor who brings Vole to Sir Wilfred. Daniell could look like he was sneering with disdain even if he was just admiring the view. He played some wonderfully upper-class cads and villains in a lot of so-so movies. He also was a first-rate actor, who, given the chance, could also play serious, concerned men, the kind you wouldn't mind having for a friend. He does a fine job here.",Witness for the Prosecution
89,telegonus,Wilder and Power,8,29 December 2007,"This Billy Wilder-directed adaptation of Agatha's Christie's Witness For the Prosecution features Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton, and these three leads could easily have appeared in a 1937 version, except that Christie hadn't written it yet, and so this film is from 1957. It's a story about a man on trial for the murder of a woman he'd only fairly recently become acquainted with who left him a large sum of money in her will, and who has a flimsy alibi as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder, and is in very deep trouble indeed. Fortunately for him, a first rate lawyer has agreed to take his case, and all kinds of complications ensue till the surprise ending, in which everything comes together, but not as the first time viewer might have expected.There's a lot of good and bad in the film. The good is a tight script; and a a bravura performance from Laughton as the lawyer (okay, barrister) with health problems; Laughton's real life wife, Elsa Lanchester, as his nurse, is delightful; Tyrone Power, as the accused, is nicely enigmatic and ambiguous; Marlene Dietrich, as Power's neglected war bride wife brings her own special brand of charisma to her role; while John Williams, Una O'Connor, Henry Daniell and Ian Wolfe are all splendid in supporting parts. As to the bad, the movie is dull looking, resembling an episode of a television series of its time. It lacks the fine tuning of the best of Hitchcock, or for that matter Billy Wilder. The pacing could be better. While I wouldn't call the movie slow moving it never at any point really catches fire. It feels rather chilly throughout. There's not much in the art direction or the photography to draw the viewer in. Wilder serves his material and doesn't bring much of himself to the party.What keeps the thing humming is its plot, which is a good one. Ty Power uses his charm skillfully in his early scenes, yet seems to lose focus later on. Laughton brings gravitas to his role but somehow fails to bring the much needed moral authority his character presumably possesses, which is absent from the actor's performance. Too often Laughton just seems to be indulging himself, which is fun to watch but not really right for his character. Dietrich seems to be working extra hard and actually convinces me that she is or could be Power's wife.Overall, Witness For the Prosecution feels like a ""leisure movie"" for its director. Wilder wasn't exactly slumming when he made it, but he wasn't running on six cylinders, either. It plays well enough, keeps the viewer's attention, yet lacks a certain heart, fire, intensity, something that might have elevated it to the level of a classic. It's definitely worth a peek if one likes murder mysteries, but it's not in the same league as Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder, which is a far more engaging movie. There's no flamboyance and little style to Witness. As a footnote it's worth mentioning that this was Tyrone Power's last or nearly last movie. He shows himself to good advantage, as it mustn't have been easy to for this middle-aged former matinée idol to have played a murder suspect named Leonard Vole. Power was clearly moving in a character star direction, and doing well at it. Had he lived longer and continued in the same vein he might have given Dirk Bogarde a run for his money over the next decade.",Witness for the Prosecution
90,classicalsteve,"Based on Agatha Christie's Play, ""Witness"" is Possibly the Greatest Courtroom Drama Ever Filmed",10,30 April 2012,"If you have never seen this film, I advise you not to ask anyone who has seen it to tell you about it. Just see it. This film has everything you could possibly want in a courtroom drama: a feisty but lovable defense attorney, known as barristers in Britain; a defendant equally as likable; and a heinous crime at the center of the plot. The immortal Charles Laughton seems born to play Sir Wilfrid, a cantankerous but lovable barrister regarded as one of the best defense attorneys in London. His doctor and nurse try to dissuade him from taking anymore clients, but when he receives an intriguing case, he can't resist. He loves trials as much as cigars and brandy. Part of the fun concerns his nurse constantly trying to keep his cigars and him far apart.Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power in his last film), an American and former G.I. who decided to stay in Britain after the war, is in trouble. He is accused of murdering a wealthy widow, Mrs French, for her money. His wife Christine is a German he literally saved from the rubble towards the end of the war. Wilfrid listens and believes Vole's story about how he met the widow and about their friendship. In the end he claims their relationship was only platonic and claims innocence; Christine is his devoted wife, not the widow. Wilfrid agrees to take the case. After Vole is arrested for murder, his wife Christine Vole (played by the incomparable Marlene Dietrich) calls on the barrister. She seems strangely detached from her husband. Wilfrid decides against calling her as a witness. During the trial, the prosecution paints Vole as a hard-up inventor who dreams of having the money he knows will be bequeathed him from the widow in the event of her death. He even stops at a travel agency and looks at all the cruises and vacation spots. But then a surprise witness appears: Christine comes to the courtroom as a witness--for the prosecution. Apparently in Britain, wives cannot be called to testify against their husbands but in some interesting legal maneuvering, Christine is able to testify.A compelling film from start to finish. If you have never seen this film before, the ending still holds up as one of the greatest twists in a courtroom drama. It makes sense that the original play was written by Agatha Christie whose twists are always the ones completely impossible to predict. While Power is certainly convincing as the young defendant, Laughton and Dietrich steal the show. This is really their film. And after you see it, please, as the film asks, do not reveal the ending to other would-be viewers.",Witness for the Prosecution
91,marcin_kukuczka,Flawless Performers and Keen Viewers Absorbed by Magnetizing Riddle,10,13 February 2011,"Different locations for movies, various places for action, indeed. No doubt the cinema has become another 'world' within this world: it reveals all magical spots and supplies us with their tremendous power. Yet, imagine a spot where the truth has many faces and the thrill addresses the very core of human curiosity; where perseverance reaches the climax of attraction and where one draws near and gives one's attendance as much as nowhere else? Not a theater but a courtroom...where the drama appears to combine thrill with sympathy and where illusion is so daring to achieve the mockery of the law. Yes, that is what we encounter in one of the greatest cinema productions, WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION.The movie can boast of several top aspects including its powerful and thrilling source novel by Agatha Christie, a top notch British crime writer, the vibrant power and magnetism of Billy Wilder's masterful direction, the overwhelming acting by the cast, the secret riddles that seem to intensify while one after another is seemingly being divulged --- in short, the movie that, by itself, deserves to represent a special genre --- a courtroom drama --- and deservedly so. Let me focus on certain points in this review, particularly the factor that, perhaps, has the greatest impression on the viewers: the performances.Agatha Christie tended to dislike seeing her works on screen. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, however, was an exception from that rule. Why? Most probably thanks to performances. It is right to say that a mockery of Agatha Christie's genius would come out if it were not for the stunning acting given by the cast. The specific nature of this drama and the stagy location intensify that cry for perfection in acting skills. Who, if not the very best cast, can supply us with the necessary thrill, with the stunning curiosity, with the awesome desire to figure out the still existing 'banana peel?' And thanks be to the cast for supplying the drama with inevitable vitality of skills and desirable generosity of talents.As there are flawless performances from the female and male cast, let me remain a gentleman in this review and say honestly: Ladies first. Yes, the female role needs a special attention from the viewers here because it is MARLENE DIETRICH. I agree with the people who claim that this is one of her very best roles though I have not seen all of her films yet. You as a viewer wait for her impatiently to turn up as you did wait to hear Garbo talk in ""Anna Christie""...and after all these moments...there she is...with her sex appeal and coldness, with her magnetizing power combined with lustful sweetness. And this unforgettable voice! Ms Dietrich seems to reach the heights of genuine acting and almost illusive bliss. You tend to believe her character in the exact moments you are supposed to believe her...Her sex appeal goes beyond her memorable song ""I may never go home anymore!"" the accordion play, great legs and kiss. Just one note more not to spoil much...there is one image of, or rather one moment with Ms Dietrich that will leave to speechless. Unforgettable! Meanwhile, the male actor who absolutely stuns is Charles Laughton who appears here with his wife Elsa Lanchester (the hilarious nurse Miss Plimsoll). Basing his character's interpretation upon his real-life lawyer renowned for distracting witnesses, he does a terrific job as Sir Wilfrid, the barrister. His character has other appeals than the one by Ms Dietrich: he is a distant gentleman devoted to his work, the one who tends to substitute cocoa with brandy and useless infections with pleasant cigars...doctors and over-caring women are a true nuisance for him...they deprive him of every solid pleasure. Mr Laughton is given some basic moments in the film, some witty moments as well (consider the joke about hats), some crucial points of the drama and he manages like a true genius. The sequences with pills and a cigar are unforgettable once you notice them and find the right interpretations.All other cast do splendid jobs as well though it is difficult to analyze all in one review. A necessity, however, appears to be a mention of Tyrone Power, whose role of Leonard Vole here is his final role for the film. He portrays the accused, the prisoner himself who is seemingly the only one who can ""shed a new light on this tragic riddle..."" He is the man absorbed by his secrets, distracted at certain moments and indefatigable to defend his motives. The moments he depicts tragic hopelessness are worth attention. Tyrone Power, unfortunately, died soon after he played this role. Among the character roles, pay attention to memorable acting by Una O'Connor who portrays Miss Janet McKenzie, a witness in need for hearing aid...The true revelation, however, about this film is the most unpredictable ending you can ever encounter on screen. ""The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture, you will not divulge, to anyone, the secret of the ending...,"" the viewers have heard at the end. An interesting fact is that the principal cast members themselves did not know how the film is going to end until the last days of filming when the ending was presented to them.Keep alert, keep keen...draw near and give your attendance until the final hour, until the final moment. That is what the courtroom is all about...in this very spirit, that is also the major pleasure of WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION...and it is really worth not to know what will happen finally until you yourself decide to see the film. But believe me...it is well worth waiting for since the long wait finally leaves you rewarded, astonished, surprised and shocked at the last moment. 10/10I have seen this wonderful film thanks to my friend's help and recommendation and I am most grateful to him.",Witness for the Prosecution

94,itamarscomix,A Whodunit Masterpiece,9,27 October 2005,"I, myself, am not a fan of Agatha Christie's or of any of her followers; I rarely find the strength to keep up with all the clues and the various witnesses, lawyers, cross-examinations and objections which all lead up to the inevitable conclusion that, well, The Butler Did It. I can certainly understand the appeal in this kind of puzzle-movie; it just never appealed to me. To me the main problem with this kind of stories is that usually, more emphasis is put on the clues than on the characters  and so, when the real murderer is finally revealed, I say: ""well, how about that?""  I simply don't care.But in every genre there are always some creations that transcend the genre. Witness for the Prosecution stands as a true masterpiece among the Whodunit murder mysteries, one that will be pure ecstasy to fans of the genre, but is also a fantastic creation on any level and in any standard. This one proves just my point, that a clever story with a lot of characters and a lot of clues and misguiding clues just isn't enough; Christie's play is masterful, of course, and the twist at the end is one of the great classic shockers of cinema, one that matches modern classics like The Usual Suspects and Memento, if not transcends them; but it took more than the story to make that ending work. The reason it all works so well is because the characters are so captivating. That is thanks to two elements  first, Billy Wilder's (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd., The Seven Year Itch) masterful direction, and an ensemble of fantastic actors, all of whom bring their characters to life; Charles Laughton is beyond brilliant as the aging, ailing, wily solicitor, and Tyrone Power is electrifying and fascinating as his client. Most of all the diva Marlene Dietrich grants a truly show-stopping performance, and steals the show from the rest of the cast  proving just how great she really was.By far the greatest trial drama ever made, and one of the greatest murder mysteries, it took the combined talents of Christie, Wilder and the fantastic cast to create such amazing drama in the courtroom alone; Witness for the Prosecution is basically an ensemble piece that is no more than a theater production, but Wilder uses the full powers that he has at his disposal as a film director  close-ups, music, cinematography, lighting  to their full potential; and thus once again it is proved that he is one of the most underrated directors in history. This is a classic that deserves to be remembered with the very best films of all time.",Witness for the Prosecution

96,elvircorhodzic,"""We've disposed of the gallows, but there's still that banana peel somewhere!""",9,14 January 2017,"WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is a great courtroom drama that contains elements of thriller, mystery and dark comedy. The film is based on the short story and theater piece of the same name by Agatha Christie. A poor innovator was arrested for the sensational murder of a middle-aged and wealthy widow. The old and respected lawyer, despite ill health, can not resist this seemingly hopeless case. The case is further complicated when the wife of the accused agrees to testify against her husband...This serious courtroom drama is ""mottled"" with tense and comical dialogues at the same time. This approach, in addition to the standard tension, is causing a good mood. Mr. Wilder has managed to create an atmosphere where emotions are literally burning. This claim is justified by an explosion at the end of the film.Charles Laughton as Sir Wilfrid Robarts the senior counsel is stubborn, witty and determined patient or lawyer. He is an extremely charismatic and dominant character. His appearance is very funny in this movie. Marlene Dietrich as Christine Vole/Helm, the accused's wife is a key character in the story. I thought that this is another example of a femme fatale, but I was wrong. Ms. Dietrich is something special and it is a privilege to enjoy her appearance and performance.Tyrone Power as Leonard Vole, the accused is somewhat inconclusive. Maybe it was a deliberate spoof by Mr. Wilder. However, his laid back approach and mixed emotions during the trial seem unconvincing. Elsa Lanchester as Miss Plimsoll, Sir Wilfrid's private nurse is the nicest protagonist. Mr. Laughton in the fight against his wife for a cigarette and a glass of brandy. I would describe their relationship as a kind of story in the story.John Williams as Mr. Brogan-Moore, Sir Wilfrid's junior counsel in the trial remained in the shadow of his mentor. Humorous interruptions are also lacking. Una O'Connor as Janet McKenzie, Mrs. French's housekeeper and a prosecution witness has through small role revived some of my memories. I just enjoy every time while watching the little ""chatterbox"".Changes in mood and tempo, black humor that is ubiquitous, interesting and tense ""fire"" in the courtroom and excellent characterization are the advantages of this film.Simple, classic.",Witness for the Prosecution

Diamond).The rest is not up to a very great movie. It's only the usual stuff well encompassed within Laughton's overwhelming stature.

Those who have seen it, have more than once; I have and once every 10 years is not bad. Those who have not must. Like the Alfred Hitchcock movies, you just can't tell how it's going to turn out, you may think you do but you don't. In this particular movie, I found it interesting to note that as part of the ending credits, the audience is asked not to reveal the ending to friends because it will spoil their movie going experience.There have been a few TV remakes of the play and the movie, but thankfully no big screen movie remake; normally I would not want to see such a fine movie remade. There are several fine directors and plenty of good actors who could do a good job in a remake and if it were to be remade by such greats, it would help a newer generation find the pleasure of Agatha Christie thrillers.

100,silverscreen888,Very Fine Pace; One of Wilder's Best Works; Intriguing and Different,8,28 July 2005,"Aa a writer, I am neither a fan of Billy Wilder nor of Agatha Christie. But I must agree with the majority of viewers who in the case of ""Witness For the prosecution"" found the central character played by Charles Laughton to be a valuable and ethical hero for the proceedings, and I must further second their positive reactions to the logic, fun and intriguing twists introduced into the trial depicted and into Laughton's attempts to figure out who actually did the crime. On the surface, the film appears to have the advantage of an unusually skilled cast and a director who worked on the screenplay himself from Larry Marcus's adaptation of a Christie shorter work, with Harry Kurnitz. The cinematographer was the skilled Russell Harlan, art director Alexander Trauner and set decorator Howard Bristol. Costumes were provided by Edith Head with the music being composed by Matty Melneck. But the showpiece here is Wilder's fluid directing of a complex story-line. When Sir Wilfrid Robarts, cautioned by his doctors not to take on anything strenuous ignores those orders, obviously an interesting case, and one promising legal 'fireworks' may be in order. The barrister's client, Leonard Vole, is being accused of murder and swears he did not do the crime. Elsa Lanchester is Sir Wilfrid' nurse, cautioning him and insisting on medical regularities that interfere with his pursuit of the truth and of an acquittal for his client, played curiously flat and somewhat as an habitual repressing liar by Tyrone Power. Also in the cast are such fine performers as Henry Daniell, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, Norma Varden, Una O'Connor, Francis Compton, Philip Tonge, Ruta Lee, Franklyn Farnum. and J. Pat O'Malley, among others. The plot revolves about the testimony of Vole's German wife, played with bite and intelligence by Marlene Dietrich, then fifty, the eponymous witness. Fireworks in court are nothing when set beside the issue of Laughton's health and the plot-twists that come fast and furious near the ending. This is a superior film which makes a dramatic work out of a mystery short story adventure; this focus change turns the attention of the viewer from the solution of a baffling murder to the confrontations among those involved in the case--opposing barristers, witnesses, authorities, Laughton, Dietrich, Power and everyone concerned. This is not a great film,m but it always an intelligently written, swift-paced and entertaining piece of Hitchcock-style film-making. The B/W format is a distinct asset here, as is the very-fine acting in general. Certainly one of Wilder's best directorial achievements.",Witness for the Prosecution

Marlene Dietrich is the German women who was his war bride, rescued from war-ruined Germany...except the marriage may not be valid.

102,ctomvelu-1,A true classic,8,22 September 2008,"Even with an ailing and miscast Tyrone Power as the defendant in a sensational murder case, WITNESS is a gem of a courtroom drama. Charles Laughton plays a famous defense attorney who takes on a case where it seems so obvious the defendant is the killer that one wonders why the barrister takes the case. The answer becomes obvious: it is a challenge for the aging and heart-damaged lawyer, who otherwise would be headed for Bermuda in the company of his perpetually nagging nurse (real-life wife Elsa Lanchester). Some of the best scenes in this classic Billy Wilder flick are of Laughton flailing about at home and in his office. The courtroom scenes seem a bit stilted by comparison, although things always brighten up whenever the camera switches to Laughton playing with his heart pills or reacting to some bit of testimony. Marlene Dietrich plays Power's two-timing wife. This was Power's last movie, by the way. He died a short time later while filming SOLOMON AND SHEBA. The ending is a shocker, although a bit contrived. It could stand a remake. Anthony Hopkins or Tom What's-his-name would be ideal in the Laughton role.",Witness for the Prosecution

The movie stars Tyrone Power in his last screen performance as Leonard Vole a man under suspicion for murdering an elderly woman and ends up employing an old British lawyer (played by Charles Laughton) as his attorney, the movie is kind of similar to The Fugitive but they both have the same plot but no courtroom scene in the fugitive. The reason why director Billy Wilder tries to keep us in suspense is because he tries to make us wonder if Tyrone Power murdered the elderly woman or not.

By feeding the social stigma up till then, never losing focus on how exactly it is portrayed and suddenly exposing the truth of it and letting the viewers know why a lot of it is actually portrayed the way it is in the film.

105,braddugg,A gripping tale of murder and one of the best judgements given ever on celluloid.,10,20 September 2014,"A gripping tale of murder and one of the best judgements given ever on celluloid.Written by Agathe Christie (the master teller of suspense stories) and directed by Billy Wilder (an incredible director who has given very memorable films in 40, 50 and 60 decades) as an adaptation of a play by the same name, this is a masterpiece of a courtroom drama. A very intense thriller (if one may call so) that is embedded in high drama. The movie has plethora of exemplary dialogue that has the touch of Wilder. Like when the nurse says to Wilfred, ""Lets get on to bed and get undressed"" its very funny but has also is right in the context. On the whole the movie is extremely witty filled with the vital thrilling points. I have not read Agatha Christie's story but for sure I believe this could have been the best possible adaptation of the written work.This movie ain't about anything except for a murder that is committed by a man accused of it and till the very end we do not know if he is guilty or not. It begins with him being guilty and ends with, Umm, please watch to know this. Filled with dialogues and shot very simplistically as every wilder movie, this tries to permeate into the view point of an audience (as even director and so is every character a viewer except the accused as he and only he knows the truth). Now the choice of a protagonist is a tough one here, coz the one who drives the story is the accused and his wife helps plots a few things but all through movie its Wilfred, the defense lawyer who is shown from first to last frame and how he makes the case out. It's a wonderful case that has to be seen to decipher the mystery. All actors have done well as Billy Wilder has the knack of extracting the right emotions from the cast but specifically, Charles Laughton as SirWilfred is just outstanding.Superb drama that is concisely and precisely written as the screenplay though nearly 100 minutes seems to run very quickly. This will standout as a masterpiece for many more years to come. Its 5/5.",Witness for the Prosecution
106,thejcowboy22,The Standard!,8,14 June 2017,"The perfect movie for insomniacs like myself who caught this epic courtroom drama on TCM commercial free with no interruptions.Our story begins with a renown British Barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts played by Charles Laughton. Sir Roberts, stout yet refined complete with monocle recovering from a recent heart ailment is cared for by his personal nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster) who was in reality Laughton's real Wife. The arguments and condescending quips being thrown by Sir Roberts at the overbearing nurse was probably as close to the real home life of the Laughton's as you can get. Enter the distressed, accused, and care-warned Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Miss Plimsoll strongly objects to her personal patient taking on any cases after Sir Robert's ailment. Sir Roberts hears out Voles statement as the accused claims his innocents to the murder of Mrs. Emily French a rich older woman who was fond with Vole, infatuated as to go so far as to make him the beneficiary to her will. I Personally enjoyed the credible performance here by Power as I the viewer, was convinced of his innocence done so naturally and humbly, Unparalleled acting. Sir Roberts takes the case under the consternation of his dictatorial nurse yet smooth as silk in his retorts to his nurse were just as caustic which gave the film comic relief throughout the entire film entwined in this unique murder trial. Vole claims to Sir Roberts that his Wife would testify on his behalf. Enter the cold, self assured Mrs. Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich) who tells Roberts and his colleagues a different story which quashes any alibi's for Vole. Vole is arrested swiftly and detained. The flashback scenes in Post-War Germany when Leonard talks about how a ceiling fell on him during his first meeting with Christine at a makeshift nightclub packed with eager G.I.'s who attacked her, ripped her pants. Dietrich showcases her talents with song and accordion. The trial begins with a cavalcade of familiar British heavy's known for television work in the 60's. Familiars like John Williams as Brogan Moore, (Robert's right hand in legal matters), who temporarily replaced Sebastian Cabot as the butler on the sit-com Family Affair. William exposure on American television was wide spread with a popular commercial for decades about classical masterpieces. Henry Daniell as Mayhew known to TV viewers as a frequent player in Boris Karloff's Thriller. Other familiars actors not born on the British Isles despite the queens tongue are Ian Wolfe as Carter known for his roles in Star Trek. The ever present Torin Thatcher as the Prosecutor Myers who was frequent guest on Science fiction related shows. Lost in Space,Time Tunnel, Voyage to the Bottom of The Sea and Star Trek. FYI last film for Tyrone Power who died a year later of a massive heart attack and last film for veteran actress Una O'Conner. Fabulous ending with tremendous shock value which felt like a Hitchcock film but Billy Wilder always gets lost in this masterpiece.

Laughton's performance was outstanding and that comedic timing impeccable.",Witness for the Prosecution

The plot however lacks sometimes a bit of interest, and the rhtyhm a bit uneven doesn't play in favor of this very static movie.But the main point for which it can be blamed is its ending, not that the ""initial"" twist is bad, far from it, it's excellent, but it is followed by a series absurd and very little credible twists. The explanation for this improbable outcome lies in the Hays Code, this censorship code that governed Hollywood's productions from 1934 to 1968 and obliged Wilder and his writers to provide this rather twisted (!) ending that inevitably impacts the quality of the movie on the whole, which remains a notch below 12 Angry Men for example.",Witness for the Prosecution

109,khunkrumark,Perry Mason and Agatha Christie have a ball!,8,6 May 2017,"I watched this again recently (2017) after seeing the BBC version on TV.Sixty years on, it's a dated but still immensely entertaining take on Agatha Christie's short story. As with all Agatha Christie submissions, there are more twists and turns than a twisty turny thing and this re-telling is no different.Whereas the BBC 2017 version decided to go in the way of gloom and depression, the movie version is played for laughs for most of the time. The characters are exquisite and deep and the story makes sense and isn't hard to follow.The most fun derives from the relationship between aging defense attorney (Charles Laughton) and his fussy and stubborn nurse Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester). They could almost be married! He starts off by telling her that he should have stayed in his coma rather than wake up to her bossing him about! Lovely stuff!Unlike the short story, this is a courtroom drama all the way. Much of the movie is consumed with the grand old world of British traditional courtroom affairs. This has the effect of almost sidelining the drama of the murder itself. In fact; if Agatha Christie had taken on a commission to write an episode of Perry Mason, this is what she would have come up with!It's not perfect, though. The wartime flashbacks seem to be there to pad out the running time of an essentially simple story. I'm not sure that the shady meeting in the dark alley really works, either.

113,bsinc,Saw it coming a mile away,7,15 December 2003,"Considering this movie is very dated and considering it has been remade in some form or the other(which I no doubt sadly saw before the original) I still wasn't impressed with ""Witness For The Prosecution"". I was expecting a good old-fashioned serious court drama but instead I got all the information handed on a plate and the serious part was very unfortunately and unsuccessfully combined with unintelligent and highly annoying and unappropriate humor that made the movie feel less credible and almost cheap. For this I blame everything on Elsa Lanchester who perhaps played one of the least suitable and useless not to mention most blatant and annoying characters I ever saw in a movie of such caliber. Her stupid facial expressions and lines during the trial should have been completely edited out and burned but she got nominated for an Oscar instead. Charles Laughton was the only truly bright star of this movie as he was  the only one who wasn't all that transparent and provided the best moments and laughs throughout the movie. His performance was really good, but somewhat short of being David Niven good. As for our main femme fatale, mrs. Dietrich's performance was the key to figuring out the plot before the foundations were even laid. When we first see her, turning up at Sir Wilfrid Robarts's house her striking and sinister-looking face made it perfectly clear.
My reasoning - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The plot would definitely include her somewhere in the disentanglement, because the character is simply too imposing and she will definitely turn out to be one of the ""good guys"" because it's just too obvious to let her stay evil-looking through the entire picture. Either that or the movie was really going to suck. So it made me think that the good guy, her husband, played by Tyrone Power, was also more than met the eye, he was just too nice and too innocent for some reason. With this in mind I quickly realized that the two would work together: either that or they were giving extremely bad performances. So basically the movie was finished as far as anticipation and mystery was concerned. I didn't however, put two and two together with Christine's disguise although I kept wondering if a woman could be that ugly and even more so to as how she got the letters to the husband in the first place. And the very ending was also a surprise when Leonard ditches Christine and explains why.  So sadly, I was deprived of the big surprise, or turn of events if you will, but it made me realize that I had perhaps seen a crime drama too many not to complete such a simple and obvious puzzle. Definitely not one of Billy Wilder's best, but still worth watching for mr. Laughton's performance alone. 7/10",Witness for the Prosecution

Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), a glib but destitute former soldier, is accused of murdering Emily French (Norma Varden), a rich older woman who became fixated on him and changed her will to make him the beneficiary a week before her murder.The time of the murder is established as after 9:30 pm when Janet McKenzie (Una O'Connor), French's housekeeper, heard Vole and French talking before she left the home. McKenzie discovered the body at 11:00 pm. Vole claims he was home with his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich), by 9:30, which she affirms to the police.However, at trial, Christine changes her testimony. She is allowed to testify because she apparently was previously married in Germany before she married Vole. She now claims her husband came home after 10:00 pm and confessed he had killed her. When it looks like the case is doomed, Sir Wilfrid receives evidence from a mysterious woman that casts doubt on Christine's testimony.The film concludes with a sudden twist.

The recalcitrant senior criminal lawyer Sir Will has just been discharged. Nurses and housekeepers have arranged a series of rehabilitation programs for her, but he was attracted by a challenging criminal case.The protagonist Wall, who was accused of murder, and Wiesel's friend lawyer Messi came to ask him to take the case. Wall has a close relationship with an elder lady and often visits her home. The lady even changed his will for him and decided to leave £ 80,000 to Wall. He was subsequently murdered at home, and it was possible to prove that Wall's innocent witness was only his wife Christine. But she actually appeared on the prosecution witness seat, which made Will feel very passive.
In the 1950s, which lacked modern detective techniques and methods, the on-site restoration of the case can only be described by the police. The key to the success of the case is the strong defense of the lawyer and whether the evidence is detailed and strong. Christine 's testimony was very unfavorable and inconsistent for her husband, which really made it difficult for Will 's defense to find an entry point. He can only see tricks and tears, suffering from failure to find a strong proof. Just then, a mysterious witness appeared ...In the film, what you hear is not necessarily the truth; the goal you have been trying to achieve may be just what others want you to do; the clues and evidence you have collected may also be forged; even your defense direction It is carried out under the unconscious suggestion of others; you have tried your best to think about it, but it is the ending that others have already designed.
In the last ten minutes of the film, it was reversed and reversed. Everything was not reasonable, but it was logical and meticulous. When you saw the end, you could n't help but filming, marveling at the cleverness of the screenwriter.
The film is based on the original work of the famous British detective novelist Agatha, and the screenwriter is also herself. The whole film has a strong sense of British humor, such as the interaction between Sir Will and the nurse (insert a digression, the actors of these two roles are indeed a couple in real life, no wonder they feel particularly harmonious).
Although I still ca n't get rid of the influence of the style of the play, for example, speaking a line of words, performing a slightly exaggerated performance, the speech speed pops up very quickly.

I recall watching this classic black and white decades ago as a teenager, and I knew there was something to it, but... as you grow older and presumably wiser, now there's the rub! WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is best appreciated by a slightly more mature viewer, and you'll find it a genuine knockout! This is one film that will keep you mesmerized, and rightly so, with the likes of legendary author Agatha Christie's assistance in the writer's seat and veteran Billy Wilder in the director's perch. It is also, and sadly, a fond farewell to the talents of Tyrone Power, who is quite good as the accused! And talk about an incredible cast. Marlene Dietrich, a bit more mature here, nearly steals the production away from her fellow actors with one unforgettable performance, as does crusty, ole Charles Laughton, who indeed has his hands full with this complicated case. This is outstanding story telling that demands repeat viewings, it is that fantastic. Behind the scenes, it was reported that Laughton was so impressed with the screenplay he assisted Wilder behind the scenes on his days off. And do not forget the witty Wilder dialogue, thrown in for good measure.",Witness for the Prosecution

126,ragosaal,"Wilfrid ""The Fox""",9,3 November 2006,"+++++++++++ SPOILERS IN THIS COMMENT ++++++++++++ Based on an Agatha Christie's short story director Billy Wider achieves a little classic in the mystery court-drama genre with ""Witness for the Porsecution"".Respected and most skillful attorney Sir Wilfrid Robards (Charles Laughton) takes the defense of Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) a man accused of murdering a rich widow for her money. Facts and evidence point to the man's guilt but Robards is convinced he is innocent and carries a brilliant defense to release him from the death penalty in spite of Vole's wife Christine's (Marlene Dietrich) accusing testimony.Charles Laughton is at his best as the old lawyer and so is Dietrich as the apparently treacherous wife and they both display their undeniable acting talents. As Vole, Tyrone Power renders what is one of his best dramatic performances; usually casted in less compromising roles Power manages here to match his heavyweight co-stars acting and also that of a perfect Elsa Lanchester as Laughton's police-like nurse.Perhaps because of the 50's standards when movies murderers (and Vole surprisingly turns to be one) were not supposed to escape justice in British located films, Wilder adds a final twist and Power receives what he deserves unlike in Mrs. Christie's amazing story where his plan works perfectly and he gets away with it.Fifty years after it was made, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" stands as one of the best mystery court-drama films ever made and one of Wilder's best directing works. A splendid movie indeed and a true classic in its genre.",Witness for the Prosecution

His wife (Dietrich 56) plays a double agent witness that gets him off.Laughton makes this movie. It was one of the more enjoyable court room movies I have seen and keeps your interest.It has unexpected twists however after the final twist I felt somehow empty. It would have worked better if Powers had been innocent without the last twist.Basically a film noir court trial. Oh there are flaws if you look for them anything has flaws if put under a microscope--e.g. people who just narrowly escaped being hanged don't blurt out the truth in the courtroom.RECOMMEND,Witness for the Prosecution
128,antagonist117,Full of surprises and great performances,9,18 June 2013,"An absolutely great courtroom drama with twists to rival ""The Usual Suspects."" Charles Loughton's barrister, irascible but committed to justice, is one of the most compelling heroes in film history. He deserves to have had his own spin off franchise or television series. Equally important to this film's success is Ty Power, who strikes just the right balance in a challenging role. Marlene Dietrich and flashbacks to early postwar Germany lend the film a 1940s noir flavor. If there is one thing Dietrich can't do, however, it is a convincing American accent. This shortcoming undercuts one of the movie's surprises, but there are plenty of others.",Witness for the Prosecution
129,krational66,The process is more shocking than the result.,9,15 April 2020,"The most important reason why a classic becomes a classic is its tenacious vitality. The 1957 legal drama, set against the backdrop of countless other films and TV shows with similar stories, never lost its luster, but became even more striking. As I watched the film, I thought, how could such a story, which has been repeated many times in the past, be presented so wonderfully? After watching this movie last night, I am still in a state of shock, and it is difficult to answer this question, so I can only slowly digest it when I review it in the future.
But in van gogh's high-quality films, the characterization of the characters is by no means inferior to the telling of the story. Sir The film from the beginning to the old man and the prestige by his side out of the people's behavior performance, and the old Sir's health also be buried under the early lead, it not only deepened the weight of the case, also affects the heart become a moment in the story behind the disturbing factors, at the same time had planted the interesting role, ""the nurse"" is in the court of the watch the intense debate at the same time, a relaxation opportunity to experience a little warmth.
Since the film is adapted from a stage play, the scene changes relatively little, especially when Leonard tells the lawyers the story, which is actually relatively dry. And storytellers very tactfully using the ""cigars"" and ""drawer"" and ""lens"" these three props, coupled with the actors wonderful performance, neither affect the viewer to understand the occurrence of the incident, and added a lot of interest for the paragraphs, and laid a good groundwork for the following story, let you believe the plot will be more wonderful.
Yes, even the three men's storytellers are rendered so amusing that the court statement that follows is simply too good to describe. As you can see, the old Sir's attitude toward different witness testimony has a considerable difference, he kept ""against"" and strong police testimony to the detriment of the defense is greatly reduced, and fundamentally shaken the trust of the jury testimony to the housekeeper, although there have been some mistake, but the power of those problems and persuasive, is forced to gasp in admiration of the senior barristers in experience and ability.
The ""prosecution witness"" that followed caught the old knight off guard, but went some way to explaining some of the questions that the show had previously left in the minds of the audience. Just when people thought the story would end there, something even better began to happen...
It is truly a stage play written by the queen of detective fiction. I have only seen Agatha Christie's ""detective polo"" films before, but I did not expect that such a court play can also be written as a detective novel. No wonder al pacino has expressed his interest in the remake more than once. The question is, would it be as good without Billy Wilder?
To all those involved in the creation of this film.",Witness for the Prosecution
130,xan-the-crawford-fan,"Good, but not classic",6,6 July 2021,"The movies that are considered 'classics' range from amazing (like Sunset Boulevard and A Streetcar Named Desire) to very, very good but terribly dull in places (like Mildred Pierce and All About Eve) to just plain unwatchable (like Casablanca and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner). The thing that they all have in common is dull spots. This one is no exception.The first thirty minutes were so dull I almost turned the movie off, and I would not consider myself one to turn movies off if they're too dull (because usually they have redeeming qualities). Tyrone Power pretty much screams his way through his role, and is perhaps too old for it. He is also the proud performer of perhaps what is the quickest death on-screen. He also died pretty soon after making this- that's perhaps the most interesting part of his role.Marlene Dietrich was never a good actress, even her most die-hard fans can admit that. From modern eyes, she seems to have gotten famous by sexuality over talent (she was openly bisexual in a time where it was forbidden and yadda yadda yadda). In this film, she's so stiff that you wonder if she's in pain speaking. She seems to have invented Method Mumbling (ahem, ""acting""), which became the default acting style in the 1950s. She has no emotion in her voice, no secret feelings in her eyes, not even eyebrows that arch when she's unimpressed. In fact, she always looks unimpressed because Von Sternberg put her eyebrows up too high on her face in the 1930s.Don't judge the eyebrows. I know, I know. But hers are exceptionally bad. They make her look look worse than she already did. You can tell she's had a face lift- if it were the 1980s, she'd be botoxed up.Anyways.The other actors are the redeeming qualities of the film. Without Charles Laughton as the judge, I would have turned it off. He was boring at the start, but put him in that wig and you've got perhaps the greatest on-screen judge that was ever characterized.A lot of the plot twists in the main story are just plain implausible. The one right at the end was amazing and I almost clapped. Dietrich almost acted for once. But then they followed that plot twist with three more plot twists and the magic was ruined.The parts of the film in the courtroom were good, the rest was meh. Simply meh. The only good thing about the so-called classics is that you feel inspired to look up other (often better) films with the actors in them.",Witness for the Prosecution
131,coop-16,Masterpiece of plot construction and surprise.,10,31 March 2000,"Anyone who doubts Billy Wilder's artistry as a director should watch this superb film. This proves that he was not just a director of sardonic comedies, but a master of suspense  fully equal to Hitchcock. The twists and turns of the plot are startling, but, in the end EVERYTHING makes sense. Wilder was also a superb director of actors...Power, Dietrich, Lancaster, and, above all, Laughton, put in the performances of a life-time. But then again, all the cameos are very good, as well. Especially worthy of notice is the very fine performance of a gifted character actress as a woman who comes forth with damaging information about Christine Vole. I cant reveal her name here, as it would reveal a crucial element of the plot..in fact, it would reveal THE crucial element of the plot.One other part of the film that should be noted is the very funny ""flashback"" where Vole tells how he first met Christine.In short, one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever put on the screen.",Witness for the Prosecution

It is also the finest adaptation of a Agatha Christie novel.In large part, credit has to go that brilliant writer-director Billy Wilder, who gave cinema so many other noir and comedy classics. This is a thriller with a good bit of comic relief in the verbal sparrings of real-life husband and wife Laughton and Lanchester as a Barrister with a heart condition and his erstwhile nurse respectively. Both give brilliant performances in their own right.The dialogue is brilliant, the plot twists are very intelligent, surprising yet believable. Marlene Dietrich also has a sizeable role with a minor love story thrown in. Tyrone Power, who I never liked is his usual wooden self.A highly recommended film classic for all ages.

137,sandnair87,Witness Billy Wilder's Genius!,10,24 March 2015,"Billy Wilder's adaptation of Agatha Christie's stage thriller, Witness for the Prosecution, is much more than your quintessential courtroom drama - it is a convoluted thriller that has a palpable atmosphere of treachery to give you one of the most involving films ever made.Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) is a wily, aging London barrister convalescing from a recent heart attack, under the care of the overbearing nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester) and under his doctor's orders not to indulge in brandy, cigars or criminal courtroom cases, but that all changes when he's presented with an intriguing murder case, that of Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), an American war hero charged with murdering a 56-year-old widow for her wealth. Robarts (and the audience) is convinced of the affable chap's incorruptibility but there is strong circumstantial evidence against him. Vole's German- born wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), someone he loves dearly, is his only alibi. But when his defense attorney says her testimony wouldn't be worth much, she's called in as the titular 'witness for the prosecution' and the prosecutor gets her to admit that she lied about the time frame and the blood found on his clothes. This detrimental testimony seems to be curtains for Vole until all the theatrical tricks are played out and the rousing climax lets us see what really happened. That is when the whole drama truly explodes!Witness for the Prosecution is Billy Wilder's stab at the courtroom genre, and he handles it with aplomb. The results are staggering largely due to Wilder's splendid dramatization of some splintering scenes that makes the air in the courtroom crackle with emotional electricity. The twists and turns of the plot are allowed to emerge unobtrusively in this intelligently paced drama that allows the film to be a completely enthralling experience anchored by memorable performances. Elsa Lanchester is absolutely delicious as that maidenly henpecking nurse, who is shrill and tireless in trying to keep Sir Robarts away from brandy and cigars. Both Dietrich and Power are competent in their respective roles. But it's Mr. Laughton's bombastic portrayal of the defense attorney that is the real draw here. Allowed by Wilder to be afflicted with a fragile heart and a haughty nurse, Mr. Laughton adds a wealth of comical by- play to his bag of courtroom tricks and makes his every line resonate like music and thunder.Witness for the Prosecution has Billy Wilder's dark, intelligent and witty paw prints all over the snappy dialogue, unique characters and the intriguing plot. The twists, turns and utter contortions of this simple case of murder keep you glued. Well, after all, it's Billy Wilder!",Witness for the Prosecution
138,ilovesaturdays,Courtroom drama with a sense of humor,10,11 April 2020,"Absolutely loved this one! What an entertaining film! I am very impressed and amused by Laughton's performance. Courtroom dramas aren't my thing. In fact, I hate legal and police procedurals with a passion! And yet, every minute of this wonderful movie is spellbinding and riveting. Without resorting to any lurid or gory scenes, the director Wilder, transports you right into the middle of the drama. Sans the gimmicks, he deftly lets your own brain create a wonderful and claustrophobic world that becomes harder and harder to get out of. This is one of those movies with so many ups & downs that you feel as disoriented as if you've just stepped out of a giant Ferris Wheel after taking many rounds. It wrings you out completely. And that's precisely what a good suspense movie does! A special shoutout for Dietrich whose role was amazing and so was her portrayal of it. Bravo!",Witness for the Prosecution
139,MrDeWinters,Best Hitchcock,10,7 September 2021,Still very enjoyable to watch. Mainly because of the marvellous Charles Laughton. Tyrone Power was 43 looking much older.

140,pere-25366,Laughton and Wilder team up to produce cinematic gold,10,5 July 2016,"Hollywood's Golden Age set the standards for how great films should be made with its pioneering narrative and visual approach. There were countless great works that emerged from ingenious directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Capra and Billy Wilder. One particular masterpiece from the latter was the 1957 courtroom drama Witness for the Prosecution.When a young man (Tyrone Power) shadily becomes the beneficiary of a recently murdered wealthy widow, he must testify to his innocence with the help of a master barrister (Charles Laughton) recovering from a heart attack. His immunity ultimately rests with his wife's alibi who opts to be a ""witness for the prosecution"", making for a tumultuous trial for the aforementioned men.I can't say enough about this film's quality – it was simply outstanding. When it was originally released, audience members were actually given and asked to sign cards that read ""I solemnly swear I will not reveal the ending of Witness for the Prosecution."" At a time where twist endings were not ubiquitous, it certainly would have stunned quite a few people. But this film unquestionably shines from beginning to end and merits a viewing from any film lover.There are many fascinating characters that bring the Agatha Christie play to life. Marlene Dietrich is phenomenal playing the accused's wife in a cold, calculating manner. Tyrone Power gives a great performance as a timid man who, for the most part of the film, is subdued in his distress. Charles Laughton, playing the defense's attorney, absolutely stole the show for me. His sharp-witted and astute character is an absolute joy to watch during the trial. He makes the trial process an enthralling, entertaining experience that seems to never have a dull moment.It is character-driven, stimulating films like Witness for the Prosecution that remind me of just how great courtroom dramas have the potential to be. This film manages to keep you in a tight suspense while simultaneously managing to be humorous, incisive and intelligent. The use of long takes and the authentic feel of the court atmosphere converts the viewer into an onlooker in the courtroom with the others. Yet another masterpiece on Billy Wilder's impressive repertoire and one of my favorite films of the Classical Hollywood Style. The man was a genius in so many ways.",Witness for the Prosecution

145,ScottAmundsen,Another Superb Entertainment from Dame Agatha and the Great Billy Wilder,10,15 December 2011,"Dame Agatha Christie was a prodigious writer, producing a novel a year for more than six decades, as well as some dozen plays and numerous short stories. In the theatre, Christie has the distinction of producing more great stage mysteries than any other playwright: TEN LITTLE INDIANS; THE MOUSETRAP (still playing on London's West End after more than sixty-five years); and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, which would become one of the great courtroom dramas of all time. In the hands of the legendary director Billy Wilder, this is not only a sensational mystery tale, but it boasts great performances from a stellar cast and a brilliant screenplay by Wilder with Harry Kurnitz and Larry Marcus that opens up the play just enough to make it work as a brilliant film, and adds some touches of comedy that highlight the drama superbly.Christie was not at all averse to such changes. She herself adapted several of her own novels into plays, changing them substantially. In the case of WITNESS, Wilder gives Sir Wilfrid (Charles Laughton, bellicose and brilliant) a heart condition, necessitating the presence of a private duty nurse, played by Laughton's real-life wife Elsa Lanchester, who drives Sir Wilfrid to distraction. The exchanges between Laughton and Lanchester are laugh-out-loud funny, a welcome contrast to the deadly serious proceedings in the courtroom.I won't reveal anything of the plot except to say that it deals with a young man (Tyrone Power) accused of murder, whose only alibi witness is his wife (Marlene Dietrich in one of the greatest performances of her career).Sir Wilfrid has been forbidden by the doctor to take on any criminal cases, but this is not a man who takes ""no"" for an answer, and he jumps on it avidly, much to the distress of the nurse (more funny exchanges).That's it. That's all I will say. This is Christie, and it is always best not to know too much about any of her works going in.Wilder's casting here is superb, though Tyrone Power at forty-three and not in the best of health looks a bit tired here. Despite this, he gives a credible performance as the accused. And I have already mentioned Laughton and Lanchester; this may be the finest moment they ever shared on screen.But it is Dietrich who surprises the most here. I can't go into it without revealing too much, but it is by far her greatest performance in a career of great performances, and should have gotten her an Oscar nomination, but the studio did not promote her for fear of revealing too much about the plot of the film. I don't know if she would have beaten Joanne Woodward's extraordinary breakthrough performance in THREE FACES OF EVE, but had she been in the running, she would definitely have been formidable competition for Woodward, as brilliant as she was.If you like mysteries, or courtroom dramas, this one is a MUST for your wish list. And if you are unfamiliar with Christie, this would be a great place to start; I guarantee you that if you see this one, you will want to see more of Christie's work, both on screen and on the printed page.Billy Wilder was one of the most versatile directors Hollywood has ever seen. This is another home run in a career filled with brilliant and unforgettable films.",Witness for the Prosecution

The Billy Wilder touch adds cynical wit to his sparkling adaptation of Dame Agatha Christie's play WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (WftP), with some of the best lines in a Wilder movie since DOUBLE INDEMNITY, thanks to Wilder, Harry Kurnitz, and Larry Marcus. In our household, ""Is that really desirable?"" has become a catchphrase, along with many other gems from the mouths of star Charles Laughton and the rest of the sterling cast! :-) I only hope people seeing this for the first time haven't already seen Marlene Dietrich's scene-stealing performance in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL, or they might tumble to the twist finale before they're supposed to! :-) (In fact, if I recall correctly, when WftP was shown on Turner Classic Movies, Robert Osborne mentioned in his intro that Welles helped Dietrich out with her WftP ""Cockney informant"" makeup as a favor!) La Dietrich looks fabulous and keeps you fascinated even when she's coming across as the ultimate bitch; it's a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar along with co-stars Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Tyrone Power's usual slightly wooden delivery actually serves him well as the defendant; somehow it adds to defendant Leonard Vole's air of feckless innocence. Henry Daniell, John Williams, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, and particularly Norma Varden as the ill-fated Emily French provide able support, too, with Una O'Connor stealing her scenes as Mrs. French's loyal but ""antagnistic"" Scottish housekeeper. A young, brunette Ruta Lee provides a memorable moment or two. As sickly but sly barrister Wilfrid Robarts and his chipper but no-nonsense nurse, Miss Plimsoll, real-life husband and wife Laughton and Lanchester shine in the most engaging performances of their careers. The comic sparring chemistry between Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Miss Plimsoll, and the warmth and understanding that's grown between them by movie's end, had my husband Vinnie opining that if another movie was made featuring these characters, Miss Plimsoll would probably end up as Mrs. Robarts before it was over -- what a delightful series that could have been! Hey, at the very least, I'd have paid good money to see Billy Wilder direct Laughton, Lanchester, and Dietrich in a sequel in which Sir Wilfrid prepares for the trial of Christine Vole, a.k.a. Christine Helm! :-)",Witness for the Prosecution

The story progresses smoothly, without any complications (despite the rather unnecessary flashback sequences), and there are enough plot twists to keep the audience interested. Even if you're not too keen on courtroom dramas, you should take a look at this one.Marlene Dietrich gives a surprisingly impressive performance as the seemingly deceitful wife of the defendant, played by Tyrone Power, who is effectively sympathetic in his role.

You can see them again at the drop of a hat, you show them to people who have never see them and it's always a triumph. ""Witness For The Prosecution"" is one of those wonders. Suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better, more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films, at least the moments with him in it, are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII, Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it. Tyrone Power is a toy in his hands but not Marlene Dietrich who stands her ground, not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen. Billy Wilder visits early Hitchcock territory with wit and fun. Elsa Lanchester's nurse is the cherry on top of this delightful film.",Witness for the Prosecution
152,joe-pearce-1,Wonderful Film and Even Better Laughton Performance,9,1 September 2016,"My 9 rating is due primarily to Laughton's wonderful performance, but the whole film is immensely enjoyable and has been so completely reviewed here that I would only like to express some long-standing feelings/questions about it at this point: 1. The big problem the film has is a padded-out quality, and I have felt this every one of the 25 or more times I've seen it since 1957. If the flashback scenes showing Power and Dietrich first meeting in an early post-war and near-bombed-out Berlin are not gratuitous, they are close. They do not appear in the original Christie story or play, and would seem to have been added to the film in order to more or less 'equalize' the roles of Power and Dietrich with that of the real protagonist of the film, Laughton's Sir Wilfred. Without those flashbacks, both leads are almost subsidiary characters; even with them, Laughton remains the focal point of the entire film. One can almost see Wilder devising these added scenes as an inducement to get two major stars to accept roles in what he must have immediately recognized as a ""Laughton film"". The other flashbacks added, of Power and the murder victim, at least serve to make that otherwise unseen victim a bit more human to the viewer, and she is wonderfully, even lovably, played by Norma Varden (who also came close to a permanent end at the hands of Robert Walker in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN). But the flashbacks do impede both the continuity and the forward motion of the film.2. From my first viewing, I have remained unconvinced that that is Marlene Dietrich as another character whom we see meeting Laughton to sell him some much-needed evidence. And even if it is, it is certainly not Marlene's voice delivering the cockney lines the lady emits. Later on, towards the end of the film, when Dietrich goads Laughton with a repeat of her ""Want to kiss me, Ducky?"" line, she is very obviously being dubbed. Dietrich was a solid (if somewhat limited) actress, but this part of what is supposed to be her performance is quite simply beyond her abilities. If this is so, I wonder who the actress was who actually did it, and how much they had to pay her to keep her contribution to the film totally, and seemingly in perpetuity, anonymous? If this had been a Hitchcock film, this would surely have been addressed and solved by now, but we don't look as deeply into Wilder films, even when one like this is about as close as he ever came to doing a Hitchcock film.3. Due to the movie Code in place at the time, where one simply could not get away with murder, the original and excellent twist ending of the Agatha Christie story and play had to be changed for the film, but in this case Wilder came up with a double-twist (almost a triple-twist) ending that was more exciting and dramatically satisfying than the original's, while still fully meeting the Code's standards. A dozen years earlier, a similar situation involved the movie version of Christie's classic AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, and in that one, too, the movie people came up with an ending quite superior to the original. And if you know Christie's writing, she was the absolute mistress of twist endings, and to outdo her twice in this area speaks well for what the imposition of an often ill-advised Code could achieve when properly thought out.4. The Laughton role in the original play was played by the great Francis L. Sullivan, but he died before the film version was made. It would not have mattered, I suppose, because Sullivan's drawing power in films would not have been a tenth that of Laughton's, but it is fascinating to imagine what he might have done with it. (While on this subject, I might add that in the 60 years I have been reading Nero Wolfe novels, and seen or heard him impersonated by Edward Arnold, Walter Connolly, Sydney Greenstreet, William Conrad and Maury Chaykin, the only actor I have ever envisaged as Wolfe was Francis L. Sullivan - along with a young James Garner as the perfect Archie Goodwin - but that it now occurs to me that Charles Laughton might well have passed muster as the mercurial Mr. Wolfe. Too late now for all concerned!)",Witness for the Prosecution
153,thespeos,Charles Laughton + Billy Wilder = Excellent Combo,9,7 November 2021,"As film for this period and genre go, it's outstanding.The cast of Powers and Dietrich are OK. Powers gets a bit over-the-top.Sadly, as per usual, some people thought Dietrich could act. Even worse, sing.She sounds like a hound trying to make love to a cadaver. Yikes!But I watched this film for Charles Laughton, since he, as per usual, carries the film.Yes, he's often playing a cantankerous character (though off screen was quite shy).Interestingly, his nurse in this film was also his ""wife.""But I am surprised at the direction of Wilder, who also co-wrote the screenplay.While Wilder is often too liberal for me, his skills are simply tops. Excellent.This is an excellent court-room drama film, perhaps a bit like ""Anatomy of a Murder.""
Many would disagree, but I think Laughton a better / deeper actor than Stewart.But I usually favor British actors over any other - they simply fill their characters better.Great film.",Witness for the Prosecution
154,DavidAllenUSA,Wonderful due to skilled stage actors and a great script which shows off actor talent,8,1 August 2009,"Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is wonderful due to skilled stage actors, especially Charles Laughton, allowed to ""do their thing.""""Their thing"" isn't seen any more in the present age (2009) because stage plays have almost disappeared and are only a memory supported by a great film like this, and that's a shame. Camera tricks, movie magic, light shows, special effects and pyrotechnics, virtuoso editing never contributed to good stage acting and good stage presentations.Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is good because writing and the acting are allowed to dominate the movie in a setting (mostly a British ""Old Bailey"" large courtroom) which is well designed and plausible, but which doesn't change, and certainly never becomes the star of the movie.The actors and the story carry the movie. The script allows actors to declaim at length, and with actors as good as most in Witness For The Prosecution (1957), that'a a treat.The only actor who doesn't carry his part of the movie is Tyrone Power (1914 - 1958), then only one year away from his early death from a heart attack at age 44, and obviously overweight and in bad physical health and without energy or power his part called for.He was used anyway because he was ""good box office"" in spite of his obvious bad health and need to avoid movie stardom pressures and challenges.Heartless Hollywood strikes again, as so often in movie history.He turned the lead role of ""Leonard Vole"" in the movie down at first, then accepted when he was offered $300,000 plus a percentage of the movie's profits. He is seen with his top suit coat button attached to hide his pot belly and protruding stomach, since a normal front middle button attachment wasn't possible.Every other actor in the movie shines, except Tyrone Power, and the others are so good, and the script is so good and allows great actors to perform without interruption, one wonders why the success formula wasn't repeated much or ever after Witness For The Prosecution (1957) was made.One answer may be that the times changed..... ""the theater"" (i.e. the world of dramatic stage plays performed by skilled actors) disappeared, sadly. The actors seen in The Witness For The Prosecution (1957) were mostly older actors trained before WWII in England at a time when ""the theater"" was still alive and well there, and actors were taught their trade with the expectation there would always be a place and need for good actor work on the stage. This expectation was never the case with the movies. Movies don't depend on good actors the way the stage always did, just as movies don't depend on good writing which isn't needed for ""good box office"" due in part to the low tastes of many younger moviegoers whose money supports the movie industry. The young audience can be served video game type light shows with no need for a logical, dramatic, or culturally meaningful script...sad but true.--------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

155,IamROCKAS,An amazing lead role made this movie outstanding and amazing series of climaxes to end the movie made this movie legendary,10,8 September 2020,"I'm all but certain that Sir Wilfrid Roberts is a distant relative of Gregory House, M.D.I was hooked from the very beginning as the beginning of the movie is simple, yet memorable. Even though this movie is old, my grandparents were in their teens when it came out, it still is extremely watchable. Some might even say it has the best plot twist (or even twists) in movie history. And if that isn't enough, I'd say Charles Laughton is enough of a reason to see this film.""Guilty or not guilty"" - the answer of that question is the end of most mystery stories but in this movie it is only the beginning of a series of climaxes. I think Charles Laughton, the actor who played Sir Wilfrid Roberts, himself said it best: ""You'll talk about this picture all right but you'll never tell them the ending to your friends because you don't want to spoil their excitement"". Movies like this have been ripped off so much that people might figure it out just as soon as they hear something about the plot twist or their skepticism kick in and they start creating all sorts of conspiracy theories in their head. I did. That hardly mattered because there were STILL more surprises to than I expected.As mentioned before, the main dish here still is Charles Laughton. Considering how ironic and cynical our society has become, I'm not surprised that TV shows like House (2004-2012) were born and what brilliant old pros may have inspired it. I recently finished watching the 8th season of that show and I can't express how similar the title character of House is similar to Sir Wilfrid Roberts. Both of them have health issues and can be described as cynic, narcissist stubborn and ill-tempered and, most importantly, they're both brilliant at what they do.",Witness for the Prosecution
156,Mnemosyne15,I think this movie should be ranked at least in the top 20 and not 70th,10,22 March 2020,"The ending is truly addictive, upside down and upside down, Billy White is indeed a great director! All filmmakers should learn his control over the rhythm of the film! No matter which aspect is perfect, such a smooth plot, so interesting lines and shots, such an attractive performance.",Witness for the Prosecution
157,InlyCii,The process is more shocking than the result,9,15 May 2020,"The most important reason why classics become classics is their tenacious vitality. This legal film, which was filmed in 1957, has become fascinating in the face of countless stories and similar film and television works.",Witness for the Prosecution
158,flickershows,Love That Laughton,8,29 August 2004,"Charlie Chaplin was funny. Charles Laughton was witty. As good as 'Witness For The Prosecution' is---Agatha Christie's story, the other actors, the technical expertise---the Oscar-nominated Laughton is THE reason to see this film. What he brings to Billy Wilder's 1957 courtroom thriller is his tremendous wit and intellect. It's a serious story, but the dark-comic tag team of Wilder/Laughton upgraded the film from ""a good courtroom mystery"" to ""a classic of the courtroom genre"".The headlining star, Tyrone Power, sure doesn't help them very much. He plays anguish about as smoothly as ripped sandpaper...and anguish is the unfortunate emotion he's got to play for most of the picture. Power has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) seems to be doing all she can to sell him out, appearing as...drum roll, please, drummer man...the star witness for the prosecution. Laughton is the brilliant (and ailing) English barrister defending Power. The plot twists 'n' turns a dozen ways from Sunday, just as it always does in Christie's best work.Amongst all the talk of bloody murder, there are running gags about cigars and alcohol. More dark wit---Laughton's character's poor health might cause him to drop dead at any moment. Wilder weaved thrills and smiles as well as any director. In this, he was wise to anchor the supporting cast with mainstays of the stiff upper lip. John Williams and Ian Wolfe (Hirsch from ""WKRP""), not to mention Laughton's control-freak assistant Elsa Lanchester (who was also CL's real-life wife), are bloody good.Movies of this type have been ripped off so often that students of the ""don't give away the ending"" class are bound to figure it out. I did. That hardly mattered because there were STILL more surprises to come. Through all that plot, Dietrich winds up being the most fascinating character. Project back and you'll realize how well her performance works. But she & Power are merely the star attractions in 'Witness For The Prosecution'. The main dish is Charles Laughton. Considering how ironic and cynical our society has become, it's stunning that brilliant old pros like Wilder and Laughton aren't more popular today. After this movie, they've become personal heroes of mine.",Witness for the Prosecution
159,Incalculacable,Great courtroom drama,8,18 January 2006,"Although a little boring at times (I'm only 14 so I suppose it's understandable) this was a very, very good movie. The script is absolutely superb - very witty and intelligent. I found the start a bit slow and boring - but once it got into the courtroom it went zooming off. The twists and plot turns are extremely good and creative; all actors shine in their roles, especially Marlene Dietrich. It's the first movie I've ever seen her in and I was sort of surprised at the way she talks but she definitely can do all sorts of roles! Tyrone Power was very good as well - first movie I've seen him in! I was really impressed with the script, acting and twists. Add all these ingredients together and you've got a great movie.",Witness for the Prosecution
160,Chuck-149,Guilty or not guilty? That's for you to see.,10,23 June 1999,"This is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  Charles Laughton is incredible as sir Wilfrid Robarts, the cranky old-lawyer who never loses, especially in the impossible cases.Coming out of the coma, sir Wilfrid definitely wants a murder case but is forbidden to try those cases by his doctors and with miss Plimsol (terrifically played by Elsa Lanchester) following him anywhere he goes, it's hard to imagine that sir Wilfrid will ever try a murder case again. However, after meeting with Mr. Mayhew who tells him that his client, Leonard Vole (interpreted by Tyrone Power), is accused of the murder of an old an lonely widow, Robarts makes a deal with his doctors that as soon as the trial is over, he will quit murder cases and take a vacation in Bermuda.The movie holds you on the edge of your seat all along as unpredictable acts take place.  It is therefore up to sir Wilfrid to save Leonard Vole and to try to find out the truth his wife is holding back.  Marlene Dietrich is glorious as Christine Vole, Leonard's wife and the whole movie is beautifully directed by the great Billy Wilder.  You've got to see it.",Witness for the Prosecution
161,delightful-life,The Brilliance of Agatha Christie,8,26 July 2016,"I grew up reading her novels and it was a pleasure to watch it act out on screen.Her stories are always simple, and its the same here - A guy befriends an older woman in the hopes that she might sponsor his invention (an egg beater). She is murdered. He was the last person that she saw. Evidence is scant.What Agatha Christie does is build up full characters and give us nearly full information. When the movie is done, and we look back, its the simplicity that absolutely stands out. She is like a brilliant engineer.And there is beautiful heart touching love included in its core. Just go see it, its more fulfilling that an Avengers movie.",Witness for the Prosecution
162,Chrimle,Incredible!,8,24 August 2020,"Amazingly compelling story throughout, with good acting and great characters. The subtle comedic undertone gives some breathing room from the constantly compelling dialogue - at well placed intervals.",Witness for the Prosecution

164,g-96059,great,8,28 April 2020,"It does not have too many involved characters, even the murderer has been almost definitely to a person's head. The rest of the story centers entirely on whether or not he really committed the crime! Thus, under this relatively compact story structure, director Billy white has enough room to enrich the story and characters with his unique comedy style.",Witness for the Prosecution
165,jameslinton-75252,Pretty meh,5,14 May 2016,"Honestly, this film didn't make much of an impression on me. I thought it generic and nothing special. I wasn't engaged throughout and my attention did wander. Sure parts of it are interesting and it is funny at times, but this wasn't consistent enough to make me really like this film. Although, the film's twist ending, which I won't spoil here, was really good. I certainly didn't expect it. I read that when the actors all signed up, they were under strict conditions to not reveal the ending to anyone. But ultimately, I just found this film boring and slow.

166,lale-ba,CLASSIC AGATHA,6,27 April 2018,"Agatha Christie is one of the most adapted writers for the big screen, but also rarely managed to deliver a bad movie script. Her crime mysteries were just to good in their core, offering endless plot twists, as did one of her first adaptations, ""Witness for the prosecution"".
William Wilder's movie brought Marlen Dietrich's charisma to the big screen, but also managed to keep the tension of a murder trial all the way through the entire movie, climaxing in a really unexpected climax at the very end. On the other hand, the acting and the development of characters won't be revolutionary
If you are into crime/mystery/trial movies you should not miss ""Witness for the prosecution"", a classical genre mainstream.",Witness for the Prosecution
167,smithy-8,A Trial to Watch on Television,10,20 October 2003,"""Witness for the Prosecution"" is the best trial movie ever made and it was made by Billy Wilder, who is known for making more superb comedies than dramas.  The other superb drama made by Billy Wilder was, of course, the magnificent ""Sunset Boulevard"", which should have won best picture and best screenplay in 1950. It lost to ""All About Eve.""   This movie was nominated for many Academy Awards but won nothing.  The only two people that weren't nominated were:  Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich. This movie provided Power and Dietrich with their best roles.  You wonder how the actors vote for the Academy Award nominations.  The academy made a terrible mistake by not nominating them. It was a great last role for Tyrone Power.  He died on top. He was overlooked as a great actor, but if you look at his filmography, he played every role assigned to him:  dramas, musicals, comedies, historical movies, and action movies.  Few actors had his ability.  His beautiful face overshadowed his ability to do all kinds of roles. He made everything look easy.",Witness for the Prosecution
168,Tetsel,"Good, old-style entertainment",8,1 December 1999,"This is one of Billy Wilder's most entertaining and easily watchable films. His direction is unintrusive but carefully guided, and again he drags forth masterful performances from his actors. Charles Laughton is brilliant, and if it hadn't been for The Bridge on the River Kwai, he and Wilder would have won Oscars for their work.",Witness for the Prosecution
169,August1991,Like Perry Mason? You'll love this...,9,6 July 2004,"I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and loved it.  I just watched it on VHS and was captivated all over again.  Agatha Christie's story, Billy Wilder's screenplay and direction, and the four main leads all get it right. Charles Laughton is absolutely superb, and Elsa Lanchester is a perfect foil.Agatha Christie's story has more twists and turns than a roller coaster and this provides a strong foundation for the movie. But the actors give life to the characters. I haven't seen the 1982 version, but I'll admit to a bias for Marlene Dietrich.  She and Tyrone Power pull just the right punches.It's a mystery, of course.  But a top notch one. So if you want only to dabble in the genre, this is the one to try. (If you like mysteries, it goes without saying that you must see it.) Moreover, this is one B&W movie for people who don't like B&W movies.",Witness for the Prosecution
170,hedgehog-10,Superb Dialogue.,10,18 January 1999,An excellent example of a film with the right people in the right roles. Elsa Lancaster is superb as the nurse looking after the grumpy old barrister played by her real husband Charles Laughton. The film has a sharp dialogue with excellent delivery. One of the best courtroom films that I have seen.,Witness for the Prosecution
171,hamlet-16,astounding...,9,2 January 2013,"I am not going to discuss the plot... look elsewhere here for information on that .. and on information about the production... but it a film that is graced by fabulous performances.Laughton blusters and puffs but his character has a mind like a razor. Dietrich is just extraordinary.. I defy you not to watch her every move. Elsa Lanchester is marvelous as the not quite so foolish nurse. Tyrone Power is all easy smoothness... he may be innocent but is he? (There is a lot of unfair criticism of Power's performance here... I think people miss the point and Power is actually precisely what he needs to be as Leonard Vole)The film is a masterpiece of direction, of writing and acting.Perhaps a little dated in style but breathtaking in its mix of drama, comedy and thriller.BUT for me above all else it is the acting not only of the principals but the whole cast (even the lovely Norma Varden as the victim is a delight) that brings me back to watch this film again and again.",Witness for the Prosecution
172,enmussak,Prime Wilder with a couple bumps,9,20 December 2002,"Throughout Witness for the Prosecution, I was thinking that this could be the best Wilder film I've ever seen (which is quite a statement).  The character of Sir Wilfrid was a very loveable character as the cantankerous defense lawyer, whose character went much deeper than his belligerent front (seen from his very loyal staff who love him dearly and his devotion to his client).  As usual in Wilder films, the dialogue is witty and really drives the movie, especially between Sir Wilfrid and his nurse (simply hilarious). ""Why don't you roll up your mouth?"" sets the tone of their relationship early.However, my biggest problem came with the ending.  It seemed like Wilder couldn't come up with the game winning shot to really nail this movie.  In the last two minutes, too much happened and it turned rather melodramatic and unrealistic.  The surprising twists are many, but I'm afraid it turned out to be a couple too many at the end.  This film was so close to being an indisputable ten, but I'm afraid it gets a 9/10.  This one is a must-see. Classic Wilder.",Witness for the Prosecution
173,lukecon-63436,"Not Wilder's best, but certainly a gripping courtroom drama",8,6 October 2020,"While my favorite Wilder film is Sunset Boulevard, Witness for the Prosecution is certainly another good entry of his. The story is gripping, mainly because it explains the conflict and situation effectively without doing so in a confusing way. Therefore, the film is very simple to understand, yet complex in its twists. However, Wilder still is able to explain the conflict, gripping the audience as a result.
The twist ending was certainly brilliantly done by Wilder, and is effective in completely changing the audience's perceptions of the situation and creating a completely different perspective for the audience. Wilder uses this concept effectively, and this adds to the brilliance of Witness for the Prosecution.
This is certainly one of the best courtroom dramas I have seen.",Witness for the Prosecution
174,dlmiley,An acting tour de force,8,20 August 2021,"An acting tour de force, Charles Laughton was fantastic as Sir Wilfrid Roberts, wasn't he? And then there is the ""Teutonic titwillow"", Marlene Dietrich, great as the icy Christine. Tyrone Power as the defendant was good, but I did have a problem with him not even trying to have a British accent, it detracted a bit from his role since he was supposed to be an ex- RAF sergeant. Elsa Lanchester's comedic interplay with real-life husband Laughton added to my enjoyment. The rest of the cast is very good. As for the ""surprise"" ending, did you see it coming? Come on now, it was obvious that Marlene Dietrich was the ""mystery woman"" with the letters - maybe better makeup would have helped. But because of the fantastic acting and great direction by Wilder, I rate this one an 8/10.",Witness for the Prosecution
175,GeneSiskel,A Vole is a Vole is a Vole,8,31 October 2009,"Pros: Charles Laughton channeling Winston Churchill channeling Samuel Johnson, Billy Wilder's writing and direction, Agetha Christie's story, the trimmings of the Old Bailey, Tyrone Power in his last screen performance, and Marlene Dietrich's pride, hauteur, and innocence.Cons: Melodramatic cadences and sonorities in 1957 (way too late), a surprise ending that the characters inexplicably reveal, and a surprise ending that the characters initially reveal through narration instead of dramatic development.It's a classic, all right, but it has the tenor of a talky 1920's courtroom play instead of a 1950's movie.",Witness for the Prosecution
176,randreww,I wish films like this were still made today,10,4 May 2016,"I compel it a sad fact that many a person of the latter generation find it undesirable to tolerate the lack of colour in telling a story, when the story is of utmost singularity where perfection is concerned. Black & white may well be my favourite medium for indulging my senses. I cannot help but note the elaborate contrasts to modern cinema where colour is but the stepping stone to a protracted pathway of editorial tricks, CGI backdrops, clipped audio contortions, & wafer thin dialogue.I wish I could say that I grew up watching B&W. Alas, my childhood is not that authentic! This film however, defines authenticity. From the get go, the performances are captivating as they are intriguing. That's what this film embodies! ""Intrigue"". It is extremely intelligent; traditional, but done with satire in all the desirable places! This film represents all the wonderfully liberating aspects to film which happens to be absent in titles today.I try my best to enrol in the current fad of comic book movies today, but they leave me feeling very pointless & empty thereafter. As do most modern films hinged on cartoonish CGI effects. And yet every time I find another one of these treasures, they leave me feeling enlightened, educated, & emotionally well nourished! This film is a joy to watch. It is shot, produced, acted, edited & scored flawlessly. It is of its' time & can therefore feel rather old, but certainly not dated. On the contrary, it is a timeless masterpiece.I do so wish films like this were still being made today. Films where the camera doesn't need to be constantly shaken to compensate for a lack of perspicacious writing.I hereby find this film Guilty of 10 out of 10 stars!",Witness for the Prosecution
177,contact-125-651146,Great Performances,9,16 January 2020,"I'm a huge fan of Agatha Christie since I was a teen (now I'm 61yo) but while I've read almost all her books, I never read the one that was the source for this movie.
Also, I never watched any movie with Dietrich. She really looked intriguing in her performance. And she really had beautiful legs!!!
Great performance for her, Tyrone Power and Charles Laughton.
Some may say that at some points there were some overacting from Dietrich and Power.
As usual on Agatha Christie's stories, surprises and tension at the end.
That's what make the difference between the current movies and the classics.",Witness for the Prosecution
178,ctrout,Wow!,10,12 February 2007,"I saw this movie a few years ago and it still resonates in my memory from time to time. That first viewing really affected me as a person because I realized what other people can do to me in the way of deceit and surprise. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that this ranks up there as one of the greatest endings of all time. It still packs a wallop fifty years later.The story revolves around a murder with the accused being Tyrone Power. Charles Laughton decides to take on the difficult case with a little help from his loving wife, Elsa Lanchester. The job of the defense becomes even harder when Power's only alibi is his wife, Marlene Dietrich. The thing is, Dietrich is a witness for the prosecution! The entire cast is wonderful in each role. Tyrone Power gives the best performance of his career, and it just happens to be his last one. In fact, this film may just be Lanchester's, Dietrich's, and even Laughton's best work. I don't want to take anything away from Billy Wilder though. His direction guides the film very easily to its climactic scene where all is revealed.We can't forget about those special assets that had to be filmed at a cost of $90,000. Of course, I'm talking about those famous legs of Marlene Dietrich and they figure prominently enough into the movie. Her fans will be lapping it up when they see them and I can definitely understand why. Once you see them, I think you'll agree. All that aside, this is a very excellent film. One that seems a bit underrated today because it isn't seen too often. I assure you, though, everyone I know who has viewed it has thoroughly enjoyed it. It's one of the best films of the 1950s and one of the best of the Golden Age of cinema.I'll end by saying that only Agatha Christie could come up with a plot like this.

179,fwmurnau,One of the screen's best courtroom dramas,10,3 April 2008,"Everything snaps, crackles, and pops in this delightful courtroom mystery, one of the best films Wilder ever directed. The cast is superb. Laughton and Lanchester, of course, and Marlene Dietrich gets one of the best roles of her career. Although she gained fame originally as a sex symbol, movies like this show what a fine and intelligent actress she was. It's really a shame she didn't win -- or even get nominated -- for an Oscar. She certainly deserved it.The seamless mixture of comedy and drama in the brilliant screenplay should be studied by all aspiring screenwriters. The funny scenes never detract from the suspenseful, serious story -- they actually make it stronger. Some may feel the melodrama of the final moments seems a bit contrived, but that's a very minor quibble.WITNESS is one of those rare perfect movies. What a pleasure to watch a film where everything -- writing, direction, acting, music, photography, you name it -- is exactly right and blends into a terrifically entertaining whole.",Witness for the Prosecution
180,Shilo_R_A,8.2/10 - Fun and Captivating Courtroom Drama,8,11 November 2021,"Witness for the Prosecution is a courtroom drama (with a decent amount of subtle comedy as well, tbh) that follows Sir Willfrid Robarts, a Brisith barrister, as he takes on a murder case despite being told by his doctor to stay away from ""over-exciting"" cases, due to a recent heart-attack Robarts had. Btw, this film is based on a play written by Agatha Christie, so, yeah, that's cool.I honestly don't think that there's a single thing that I truly dislike here. The one thing that bothered me as the movie entered its final act was some character that felt as it was written with laziness, but everything came together in a pretty interesting way eventually, so it's not much of a problem.Witness for the Prosecution is, I'm pretty sure, the first courtroom drama that I've seen (I mean, the closest thing to it is Capernaum, but most of this film isn't about the trial so I don't really consider it to be one) and it was much more fun than I expected it to be. Willfrid's character is really fun to watch, since he has such a sarcastic, grumpy (yet kinda childish) way about everything - especially his job - and it's really entertaining to watch.The pacing of this film is also quite on point, and I was interested in the plot pretty much for the entire runtime of the movie. It has its fair amount of twists and hooks, so, yeah, not a moment is wasted here.The movie doesn't have an extremely iconic score or cinematography or anything, ,but despite its relative simplicity I'd say that it's decently made, on a technical level. The real attraction here is the plot, the characters and the dialogue, which were enough to keep me captivated.Overall, I had a really good time watching Witness for the Prosecution. It's a fun, well-written and captivating film, the characters are all interesting and fun to watch. It's simple, but it knows what it is and succeeds in what it's going for. I'm feeling an 8.2/10 here.",Witness for the Prosecution
181,italo505,Damn Youuuuuuuu!!!! LOL,7,3 January 2013,"The other day I started watching a movie from 1957 called Witness For the Prosecution starring Charles Laughton, Tyrone Powers and Marlene Dietrich in an adaptation from a novel by Agatha Christie and directed by Billy Wilder who had previously directed Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Gloria Swanson in the classic Sunset Blvd. Although I had never seen Marlene Dietrich in a film before I knew that she is quite a name in the glamorous old Hollywood movies of an era that shall never come back again, when real movies had really good scripts and when you really had to pay close attention to the story and just enjoy the great performances . Witness For the Prosecution is as complicated and multi-layered as mystery movies ever come: a man (Tyrone Powers) has been wrongly charged of murdering an old lady and is seeking legal advice from a famous attorney (Charles Laughton) who happens to recently come back home after having a heart attack. He's not supposed to take on any stress that may jeopardize his health but as stubborn as they come, this old man won't give up his cigars, take on this murder case while fighting with his nurse that insists he shouldn't be doing any of it. I love the way this movies present these characters in a comical, multi-layered yet simple way and allow them to take shape. When the accused man's wife (Marlene Dietrich, as stunning as ever) comes to the lawyer's home to supposedly defend her husband and give him an alibi in court but, it turns out, shes as devious and mysterious as they come. That's when the real mystery begins and everybody seems to be a suspect.It was a real joy to watch all these characters and see what unfolds in the courtroom, especially a crucial moment in which Marlene Dietrich takes the stand, as a witness for the prosecution nonetheless and breaks down while being questioned by the defense lawyer. At first I wasn't sure if that was her voice since they don't focus on her right away while she's delivering her lines but then it becomes clearer, and clearer, and clearer: ""Damn you, damn you, Damn you! Damn you! Damn youuuuuuuuu""... I didn't know what to do so I started laughing since it's just like one of those lines that are always featured in the vignettes for the Awards Ceremonies as the pivotal scene of the movie yet it becomes instantly classic and her deliverance certainly deserves an award of some sort (unfortunately no such luck for Marlene that year) and I had to stop and rewind and rewind it just to get my fix. There are certain movies that I can quote line by line such as Mommie Dearest , or The Birds, or Sunset Blvd and now I have a new classic Hollywood line that I already started quoting to my boyfriend and always get him to laugh (in guttural deep voice:) ""Damn you, damn you, Damn you! Damn you! Damn youuuuuuuuu""Ahhhhh, they don't make movies like this anymore...",Witness for the Prosecution
182,Cue-ball,Some reflections upon seeing this movie for the fourth time,10,14 February 2003,"""Witness for the Prosecution"" is one of Billy Wilder's finest efforts, in the league of ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Fortune Cookie"". The elements of the plot are familiar -- innocent man (?) accused of murder, all evidence points to his guilt, outstanding defense lawyer must think of something to acquit him. I agree with most of the positive reviews already written about this movie. After having seen it again tonight, I wanted to attempt to add two new ideas.1) Roger Ebert has called Orson Welles's entrance in ""The Third Man"" the greatest entrance in the history of cinema. I respectfully disagree; Dietrich's offstage line in ""WFTP"" takes the crown in my book. I still get goosebumps when we, the audience, are treated to the offscreen sultry German accent finally announcing her presence in her husband's attorney's chambers. It is incredible that she was in her mid-50s when she made this movie.2) One common criticism of this movie, in which I concurred until recently, is Tyrone Powers's ""hammy"" acting. View the movie more closely. I submit that Powers's performance was above average -- a tribute to Billy Wilder's ability to bring out the best in his cast -- with the exception of his testimony from the dock. But that had nothing to do with Powers's ability; that was Leonard Vole hamming it up! If you can view the movie in this perspective (or rationalization, if you prefer), the film is nearly note perfect.",Witness for the Prosecution
183,julianhwescott,Billy Wilder does it again!,10,8 July 2001,"I usually don't care for the films made from Agatha Christie mysteries, as they must be very hard to film because something is usually lacking in the transference from book to movie.  ""Witness for the Prosecution"", however is another matter as it is an excellent film.  There isn't a dull moment in this story.  All of the actors and actresses are perfectly cast, especially Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton.  Even Tyrone Power is cast in a role unusual for him--instead of being just a pretty boy he is a distinguished defendant.  There is a lot of comedy within this film as well as suspense and a lot of plot twists to keep you guessing who killed Mrs. French.  Elsa Lanchester is excellent as the nurse prescribed for the stubborn Charles Laughton.  Just sit back and watch, relax and enjoy!  A 10 out of 10!",Witness for the Prosecution
184,jacabiya,Some comments,8,23 August 2015,"This is a delightful film with a wonderful performance from some say the best English actor in the 20th century, Charles Laughton, and an excellent supporting cast, mostly British. It is curious to me how Billy Wilder, one of my favorite directors, a German who developed his career in Hollywood, ended up with this project – an Agatha Christie play - more suitable it seems to a British director. Some people even think Hitchcock directed this film. While I very much enjoyed this film, I have some reservations: the denouement is difficult to assimilate – one initially believes Vole and his wife are simply playing another trick when he openly kisses his girlfriend in front of his wife and lawyer, and it is not until his wife reacts that we come to believe his actions, and her reaction thereafter, are real, moreover when we have been convinced that his wife does not love him, and her final act somehow fails to dispel this notion and move us to believe she was deeply in love with her husband. This is so because Tyrone Power fails to convey the type of man a woman would fall in love with, and Marlene fails to convey the type of devoted woman we finally find she is, and this because we are supposed to understand she is much older than him, when Dietrich actually looks much younger and beautiful (thanks to the use of her ""tape lifts"", and some pair of legs) even at 56, and Power looks much older. Another story it would have been if they had used William Holden in his role. I also had a problem with the notion that an overweight attorney with a 240/110 blood pressure and a weak heart, constantly fainting or wincing in pain, would be allowed to litigate in court,and to see him run to the train station in his condition was difficult to believe. Moreover when trial ends his nurse announces he would not go on vacation but continue with another criminal case, which is simply absurd. These I guess are things a less demanding audience in the 50s in that simpler Hollywood age would not have minded. Another grievance is that Dietrich's voice when playing the cockney girl is clearly dubbed, maybe by herself in the studio, but nevertheless it somehow feels like a cheat. Some people even believe some other actress played the part, but so much mystery surrounded this film due to its surprise ending and the need to keep everything secret that we will never know, and this some say cost Dietrich at least a nomination for the Oscar. Finally while I don't agree this film should be in position #76 based on only 50K plus votes (Throne of Blood is in the list with only 26K votes), I understand the problem of raising the 25K minimum votes to let's say 100K, which would drop many deserving classics like The General, City Lights and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. I do not believe this film is in the same league as these other films, but that is only my opinion, and at the same time it is much better than many other films in the list.",Witness for the Prosecution
185,axile007,astonishing climax resulted in a very powerful movie,10,15 July 2008,"I started watching this movie with very least interest since besides being quite old and black and white,it is expected to be quite slow.At least that was on my mind,but with every next scene movie goes on impressing me thanks to the humor added Charles Laughton as an old lawyer.Witness for the prosecution is based on Agatha Christie novel.I previously encountered with another movie on Agatha Christie novel ""Murder in Orient Express"",and I wasn't quite impressed with that so expectations were low.But at the end I loved this movie because it gives you a big surprise in the end The movie deals with a man on the trial of murder.Its hard to imagine such movie in 50's because it seems so fresh today also.Watch it out guys,it's something special !!!",Witness for the Prosecution
186,emdragon,silly ending spoils good movie,7,24 April 2005,"I watched Witness For the Prosecution tonight, and was struck by it. It is an interesting courtroom drama with solid performances all round; compelling in it's style and makeup, and well directed. But the ending, after such a plausible and almost beautiful winding story of complete believability. . . left me shaking my head in disbelief. How the film makers could allow such a fine picture to collapse with such a concoction of trumped up melo-dramatic absurdity in the final scene goes beyond absurdity. It was as though someone in the production staff decided they had to save Charles Laughton's (who gave a grand performance as the lead defense English barrister, Sir Wilford Robarts) reputation, so that he did'nt come off looking as though he had been duped by the main characters involved in the murder he was defending. Afterall, Laughton had been the beloved protagonist featured as the barrister hero throughout the film. So at the end, when the wife (Marlene Dietrich) saves the murderer (Tyrone Power) from the gallows, they had to quickly concoct a scene to avenge the wicked and scandalous trick that had been played on the defense team, the law, and the true hand of justice. If they had allowed the husband and wife to walk off together hand in hand into the sunset at the end, I would have said this is one of the greatest courtroom pictures ever made. But Billy Wilder could have done much better with the ending IMO, which had nothing to do with plausibility, and for me almost ruined the picture. Kudos to the actors, especially Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Elsa Lanchester. More kudos to the director who clearly did a masterful job right up until that final silly scene that kind of ruined it for me.",Witness for the Prosecution
187,k-thomas,Laughton's finest performance.,10,11 October 2014,"Up until i saw this film for the first time yesterday evening on DVD, i always considered Charles Laughtons best performance was as Grachius in Spartacus, but this was overwhelming. As i have stated in my reviews of other old films, they do not make them like this any more. The humor coming out in Laughtons lines was hysterical, considering the serious storyline. There were fine performances from all the actors. Tyrone Power proved he was not just a swashbuckler, but a fine actor. Marlene Dietrich played the part of Powers wife brilliantly. You might notice a connection with Mutiny on the Bounty. Charles Laughton Played Captain Bligh in the original version and Torin Thatcher, the Prosecution Barrister, played the Captain of the HMS Brittainy in the Marlon Brando remake, but his scene was deleted. A must for anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas.",Witness for the Prosecution
188,dcheng-7,Suggesting a more reasonable ending.,9,14 July 2006,"The film is magnificent in many ways and I enjoyed it even more every time I see the replay.There is only one flaw, the ending part: where no one could see the reason for Christine's early revelation to Sir Wilfrid that she was in fact the Cockney woman at the time when even the media crowd were still at the front-door. There's no way for a woman as wise as Christine to do something like that at that moment.A more reasonable ending would be: before revealing to Sir Wilfred the truth Christine stabbed Leonard when she found out he was leaving her for Diana, and while being carried away by Police, she then indicated to Sir Wilfrid the 'signature gesture' of showing the ""scar"" of her right cheek. Sir Wilfrid then knew and laughed crying "" She had executed him!""Then the film will be perfect.",Witness for the Prosecution
189,amanbirsingh,Witness for the Prosecution,8,18 September 2021,"Based on Agatha Christie's novel and set in 50's London, the story follows the trial of a Leonard Vole, businessman accused of homicide after making friends with Emily French, an old and rich lady who leaves him 80,000 pounds in her will. Tyrone Power, Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich play fierce roles in this engaging drama that recalls the events of a murder through a rational and scientific perspective in the face of intrigue.Wilfrid Robarts (Laughton), defence lawyer, smartly dodges one bullet after the other thrown at him by the prosecuting team and is made to toil through the court room as the suspense unfolds over the capital sentencing of his subject. This is not helped by the false evidence given by a cranky housekeeper, resenting her omission from the same will, and an estranged German ex-wife (Dietrich) who wants to get even. Robarts goes for the incredulous here and exposes bigoted members of society with a show of brilliance and guile worth lauding.The film is tryingly particular about norms and contains cultural references, especially about modernism and social etiquette. The theme of national community and a common destiny is kept forever close as the film-maker wishes to present the strength of human cooperation and relationships.Rated at 8, the film is highly recommended for its power and intensity. A film that starts excitingly and propels itself only finishes with a tumultuous end. Another fine film by Billy Wilder who makes this adaptation stand on its own artistic value.",Witness for the Prosecution

Billy Wilder extracts excellent performances from the cast, which includes Tyrone Power, in his last role, Elsa Lanchester and Charles Laughton, who were married in real life. Laughton as Sir Wilfrid is perfectly cast as the foxy British barrister. I have been to the Old Bailey and Wilder has captured the atmosphere of the British court scene flawlessly.

I can't say enough how funny and unexpected this movie was. Courtroom dramas seem to have stuffy, by-the-numbers, and stiff plots, but Witness for the Prosecution sure doesn't fit that bill and seems to be aware of the original conventions just so it can spin them around like a top.For those of you hesitant about the classics, the humor in this transcends generations.

The brilliance of this film lies for a great part in its carefully constructed screenplay, which is based on Agatha Christie's play of the same name. Its seemingly simple plot has been masterfully executed by a brilliant cast. It doesn't happen often that a film truly surprises me, but this film did just that. I don't like to get descriptive in my reviews, so I will conclude with a quote from Billy Wilder, the film's director. This quote is from an interview included with the release I watched.""There are only two kinds of films for the public - the simple story, padded out, furnished in rococo; the simple plot allows visual embellishment. Then the complex story, filmed simply in order to make it comprehensible.""WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is the latter. But don't let ""filmed simply"" withold you from watching this brillant classic.

195,PizzicatoFishCrouch,The best Agatha Christie adaptation by far.,9,17 April 2006,"When an old, poorly-healthed judge Wilfrid Robarts is approached one night with a baffling case concerning Leonard Vole, the accused, it is up to him to try and find out what really went on. This job is not made easy for him when he meets the accused's cold wife, played with ice intensity Marlene Dietrich, who, for some reason, seems to be working against her husband. Who is really telling the truth? Anybody who knows Agatha Christie will know that nothing is ever how it seems. Just when you think you've found a red herring, you find out that you were right along to then find out that everything was a bluff. Or something. So the plot twists, even for those who are familiar with Christie, will always surprise. And nobody is better chosen to adapt her play than Billy Wilder, one of Hollywood's best capable, adaptable directors. He classily uses the courtroom backdrop with deft ingénue, creating a film with courtroom drama elements, as well as petty comedy and sizzling suspense, all brought together by the excellent performances.As the grumpy defence lawyer with an overbearing nurse, Charles Laughton combines comedy and drama excellently, never failing to make us smile, but also shining at the dramatic moments. Elsa Lanchester, who was married to Laughton in real-life, has great chemistry with him in their light-hearted banter. The other performance in the film that stands out is from Marlene Dietrich, as Vole's ambiguous wife. As Christine, she uses her wintry persona to perfect effect, creating a character that is as intriguing as she is dislikeable.A few tiny quibbles. The plot, though interesting, could never happen in real life. Things work out just a tiny bit too conveniently. But overall, this is a finely made, superbly acted, and very gripping mystery.

I don't know if such a category exists or is recognized, however I would consider a court-hearing thriller a movie whose main scenes and events take place in hearings before a criminal court. In this meaning, I would not consider ""The verdict"" but probably would consider ""12 angry men"". But, as usual with Billy Wilder, this movie is a lot more. A monumental (in any sense of the word) Charles Laughton. A surprising Marlene Dietrich, who also plays a sort of ironic parody of her past in Germany and her past role as the Blue Angel. A convincing Tyrone Power, whose role will leave you with big surprises. Super-witty dialogs and tons of bitter irony over the rituals of justice, that cannot do much to help the truth come to surface.

You are never quite sure how much you don't know, right to the end. Laughton and Lanchester are delightfully amusing without detracting in the least from the main story line. Tyrone Power is convincing and Marlene Dietrich is at her peak - not only as a fascinating woman but a startlingly effective actress.

202,clive-38,Superb courtroom drama with unusual twist ending,10,27 December 2000,"Charles Laughton is first class as defending counsel Sir Wilfrid Robarts in this riveting courtroom drama directed by Billy Wilder and adapted from the Agatha Christie play. A terrific cast which in addition to Laughton included Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester, John Williams and Henry Daniell.Power plays Leonard Vole suspected of murder with his only hope being famous defence counsel Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Laughton) who is not entirely convinced of Power's innocence. Sir Wilfrid contacts Vole's wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich) in the hope she can provide a defence for her husband. Things do not work out exactly as Sir Wilfrid had hoped they would and there are many surprises along the way leading to the shock ending that was totally unexpected. Much of the action takes place in the courtroom but as usual in a Billy Wilder picture the story grips your attention throughout and has a marvellous surprise ending.Some favourite lines from the film:Charles Laughton (to Tyrone Power): ""Young man, you may or may not have murdered a middle-aged woman, but you've certainly saved the life of an elderly barrister"". (Thanking Power for giving him a cigar).Marlene Dietrich (to Laughton): ""You wanna kiss me ducky?"".Elsa Lanchester (to Laughton): ""Sir Wilfrid - you've forgotten your brandy!"". (Final line in film).""Witness for the Prosecution"" received six Oscar nominations. These were for Best Picture, Best Actor (Charles Laughton), Best Director (Billy Wilder), Best Supporting Actress (Elsa Lanchester), Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Unfortunately, not one of these well deserved nominations won the Oscar. The Best Picture Award that year went to ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" which was of course a wonderful film and a popular choice. The Best Director Award went to David Lean for the same film and the Best Actor winner was Alec Guinness (again for ""Bridge on the River Kwai"").""Witness for the Prosecution"" was remade in 1982 as a TV movie with Ralph Richardson, Deborah Kerr and Beau Bridges which despite having a very talented cast was not a patch on the original unfortunately.

All the performances - especially Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich - are convincing and well shaped. Billy Wilder directs with his usual wit and acuity. Definitely the best of Agatha Christie's film adaptations. A man accused of murder is defended by a brilliant but ill barrister (played by Charles Laughton) - he's just recovered from a heart attack. His nurse (Elsa Lanchester - Laughton's real life wife) tries to prevent him from taking on the case, but to no avail. The accused (Tyrone Power, in his last film) seems friendly, sincere and caught in a web not of his doing. But all is not as it seems. The twists and turns in this film keep you guessing and the biggest twist is right at the end. I think this is one of Dietrich's best parts. Her role as the defendant's wife is central to the plot - just how, you will have to see for yourself, assuming you haven't already seen it.

And I love fantasy such as Wizard of Oz, Princess Bride etc..romantic stuff when it's done right. That said: 1) A very naive audience is required not to notice that a piece of evidence (particularly a knife) does not remain on an attorney's desk, or anyone's desk in a courtroom after a trial has been concluded. It would have been taken back by the bailiff before the conclusion of the trial to be returned to Vole along with his other belongings as the judge said. Might I humbly suggest that Christina be carrying a small revolver instead?..Too late! 2) That was the fastest death by knife wound in cinema history I believe, taking about two seconds. No effort was made to revive the victim.3) Vole's ""new girl"" the brunette, just stands there watching as he gets stabbed. She didn't see any attack coming after pointlessly and mercilessly taunting Christina? 4) Are we to believe that an attorney could produce any letter that would clear a client without corroboration? The judge had denied the request to submit the letters only minutes earlier. At a minimum, if they had been allowed as evidence, the witness who possessed the letters would have been called in as would a handwriting expert.5) After the trial, everyone proudly admits to the crime right there in the courtroom. If they were clever enough to conceive the plot why would they? Reminds me of the old Batman comic strip, ""Criminals are a cowardly and stupid lot."" Listen up kiddies, there's the moral.6) No defendant is allowed the liberty of a running commentary during the testimony of other witnesses without being warned by the judge that they are out of order.

The first time, of course, the plot twists engross and likely fool the viewer. Even when the story is familiar, the workings out of the action enchant and delight. Strong performances by Charles Laughton, the barrister staunchly defending the innocent and charming Tyrone Power, so frequently the hero in his films, contrast with Marlene Dietrich's despicable role as his cold-hearted and faithless spouse. Her disdain for love and fidelity, her absolute selfishness, reveal her as a liar and bigamist determined to undermine her helpless husband. Supporting cast members are all spot-on, especially Elsa Lanchester, the competent yet frequently subverted nurse, who actually knows the contents of her employer's thermos of cocoa and equally understands his resolve in defense of the innocent.

But Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich were convincing too in their portrayal of an innocent, afraid for his life man and a disloyal, unloving, poker faced wife respectively.Some people might say that they predicted the ending half way down the movie but i am not quite sure as to how the predicted the ACTUAL ENDING before it really unfolded before their eyes?This movie is great not only in the part played in court but also in the scenes shot in Sir Wilfrid Robarts's office(also due to Miss Plimsoll's caringly lovably irritating character!).Perhaps the people(the minority I'd like to believe) who don't think this movie deserves the high ranking and rating that it's got here saw this brilliant piece of art as more of a suspense thriller.But I loved this movie as a delightfully ENTERTAINING, MYSTERIOUS, DRAMA !I rate this 10 just because I haven't seen any other CLASSIC courtroom drama that was intense throughout(barring some light hearted scenes with Sir Wilfrid Robarts) and yet in the end I somehow felt light-hearted and had a smile on my face rather than a thought provoking look on it.The commentary in the ending credits was innocently adorable for our times of social networking ""The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture you will not divulge to anyone the secret of the ending of Witness for the Prosecution!And mind you I am a big fan of 12 Angry Men and How to Kill a Mockingbird!

Tyrone Power showing his acting pedigree. The film is one of many examples of movies, novels, and plays where murder is presented not as it is, but as a mechanism for a narrative and plot. Be that as it may, I never read Ms. Christie's story or play, but I understand that the movie included her final ending. Therein, I think lies the fault. The final scene is there to establish justice, murderers must pay say the censorial public and codists. How much better would the film be if the killer walks, and his devoted wife loses him to the younger woman. End of story.",Witness for the Prosecution

I had seen IMDb's impressive 8.2 rating (and I have come to trust their rating system), which was enough for me to at least consider. The first time watching this, I made it about 70 minutes before I stopped watching because, and maybe it was because my expectations were heightened, I was bored. The cinematography, acting, plot, and settings were about average, but not enough to keep my attention. A month later, the rating rose to 8.4 (this was back in 2011), so I though maybe I was missing something. I still had to persevere through two thirds of the movie before it really got interesting. But now I had reached what gave this film the praise it deserves. Everything they had given you before the final 15 minutes is simply the facts you needed to know, and then they throw you what is possibly the greatest twist ever. No spoilers here. I stared at the ending credits the entire time because I was trying to wrap my head around what I had seen. It was unexpected, made perfect sense, and made the actions of the characters far more reasonable than anything I could think of. And I KNEW this twist was worked on for a long time because once the credits were over, a final slide popped up and said, ""If anyone you know has not seen Witness for the Prosecution, do not tell them the ending."" If you can buckle down and watch this thing to the end, you will not be disappointed.",Witness for the Prosecution

213,MrSpark,The master of suspense,9,26 July 2013,"One of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, many people confuse the director for Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense, in fact this brilliant marvel of a movie was directed by none other than Billy Wilder one of the most bewitching director and writer of early Hollywood. The movie is a beautifully scripted courtroom drama with comic, dramatic and suspenseful elements based on the play by Agatha Cristie. It brings you unprecedented acting by Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. The role of the accused was played by Tyrone Power who delivers a very inspiring performance that manages to capture the sympathy of the audience. The simple set of the movie (The courtroom, The judge's house etc) indulges the audience to focus more on the actors and their astounding performances. The sole reason this movie left me in complete and utter awe is of course the twist ending, classic with Agatha Cristie plays, that I will not reveal for obvious reasons. I usually figure out movies with twists but I must say this came to me as a surprise, as I thought the movie was over. Summarizing, this Agatha Cristie courtroom drama gives us profound acting performances and delivers us a story with tremendously suspenseful cinematography and one of the best twist endings I've seen. Thus I give this beautifully wonderful movie a 9/10.",Witness for the Prosecution

There is no single performance which cannot be termed brilliant in this movie. The movie plot keeps u edgy, the simplicity with which the dialogue delivery is done is remarkable. And despite the brilliance of all the actors, Charles Laughton's performance stand apart. If he would have been a real life lawyer, he would not miss a single case.

The dialogues in this courtroom drama-slash-murder mystery are sharp and witty, and Charles Laughton's charmingly sarcastic delivery ensures practically every line from his character Sir Wilfrid is solid gold.

Nobody could do it better than Billy Wilder did in 1957. A man accused of murder, Tyrone Power, the weakest link in this terrific chain. Sir Wilfred is called to defend him, he is played by the extraordinary Charles Laughton, but he's just out of hospital - he wasn't dismissed he was expelled - and due to doctor's orders he's not to take any criminal cases. He finds Power charming and personable enough but he's not going to risk his life to save his until Marlene Dietrich makes her entrance - and what an entrance! How marvelous that what amounts to a bit of Agatha Christie's usual fare becomes such an entertaining and at times right down riveting piece of film-making.",Witness for the Prosecution

I was a little nervous to see how Dietrich was as an actress, since I had never seen her before, but geez, she was amazing. I knew about some of the twists, but towards the end it was just getting better and better. Lots of great lines, and great actresses; especially Elsa Lanchester is marvellous. Also liked Una O'Connor, and Norma Varden. Charles Laughton is also very good. I loved the way Christine introduced herself. ""I do not think that will be necessary...""

221,Quannianjiexia,"I guess right about the ending, but wrong about the humanity",10,19 March 2020,"The prosecution witness is indeed the most exciting part of the suspense inference movie. The storyline is different from the general suspense inference process using multiple reversals in the middle to achieve the effect. On the contrary, this film directly takes the audience from an interlocking plot development direction. After going all the way to earn enough interest from the audience, I finally overturned this line directly. The initial premise is really wonderful. Especially the middle and later paragraphs of the court trial are really textbook-like operations as a trial black and white film. Although it is not cool Advanced technology This kind of rigorous, humorous, humorous line script and the superb acting performance of the film emperors are simply the fierce confrontation between the prosecution and the witnesses of the art.

And Charles Laughton . . . probably his best film as well. (At least Laughton was Nominated for an Oscar.  Dietrich wasn't even nominated.  A little jealousy in the Academy, or what?  Yeah, you bet.  What a shame the Oscars are so political and sometimes total BS.)  It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director, but not even a nomination for Dietrich?  If that isn't BS, what is?  Total jealousy in the Actors Guild.  Really sore they weren't as natural and tremendous of an acting talent as Marlene.  Obviously so.Great story with some good plot twists.  Thanks Agatha Christie!

As you could see the accused acts so frankly and neat itself suggest that something fishy is going on. As suggested by everyone it is an open and shut case where the motive for the murder is clear cut given the last will is announced by the victim. I suggest the plot is flawed as entirely based on a well planned drama by wife of the defendant, washes away the entire case built by the prosecution ignoring all other facts that came into the light. It is obvious that the perjury is a minor crime compared to murder and could be out in no time given a good defense lawyer is hired. That is the whole idea centered across of the play.",Witness for the Prosecution

(BTW one point seems to have escaped all reviewers. The Laughton character is clearly based on the aged Churchill (down to the cigars).)I am aware that the court interior was built in Hollywood. Many of the external filming was done in London, eg the Strand and Lincoln's Inn. I should like to know whether all internal filming was done in Hollywood.",Witness for the Prosecution
225,kterryl,This is a Spoiler,7,25 January 2009,"I enjoyed this movie because I like courtroom films. I also enjoy war movies, and for that matter, almost every kind of movie, except musicals, generally, and absurd fantasy types. Having said this, I want to make the point that the motion picture industry cannot do anything true to life. The need to produce drama is the worst spoiler of all, because the best writers can't seem to come up with believable incidents of the type that would happen in real life. Real life is full of coincidences and unbelievable situations, that seem perfectly acceptable when they happen, but these things cannot be put into a work of fiction without seeming forced. There, I got that off my chest.This movie was exceptional because I finally saw Tyrone Power in a sympathetic role, where I actually did not dislike him. I do not consider this odd, because other commentators have agreed with me that they do not see his attraction. As I have said in comments on other of his films, I have heard from reliable sources that he was very hot stuff in the 1940's, but I cannot see why. Maybe women found him attractive, but I would say there were better looking leading men then.Following is the spoiler: About 2/3 of the way through the movie a new character showed up. I said to myself, ""who is this character really?"" Is this the sister of the Marlene Deitrich character in disguise?"" more likely, ""Is this the brother of the Marlene Deitrich character in drag?"". Obviously, at least to me, if not to Robert Osborne of TCM and most other people, this character was being played by Marlene Deitrich in very heavy makeup. ""Why?"", I kept asking myself, to the point of distracting me from the rest of the movie, until the secret was revealed. I don't want to sound like Sherlock Holmes, but all the details of the disguise were too obvious. It was like she was supposed to be spotted. But she wasn't! Luckily for me, they have this film at my local library so I can watch it a few more times to see who screwed up. The whole big deal they made about not revealing the ending to people who had not seen the movie seemed to me to be totally ridiculous.Elsa Lanchester, Charles Laughton, and most of the supporting cast did their jobs very well, so it won't be a chore to see it again. Elsa's little thing at the end made it almost seem like truth, not fiction.",Witness for the Prosecution

Further, outside of the court, Charles has such a finicky and droll humour that I was so tickled by his badgering of his nurse (who happens to be his wife in real life).Marlene Dietrich is superb as well. She just commands the screen and that wonderful German accent is spellbinding.Tyrone Power is a powerhouse but I found that he somewhat over-acted just a tad for my liking; however, this does not deter the quality of the entire movie.This is a terrific movie with a great little twist at the end, so stay with it right to the very end!",Witness for the Prosecution

The many twists and secret motivations cost the whole thing a little credibility, which is why I rate it ""only"" 9/10. On the bottom line, however, that's a small price to pay for a very enjoyable movie.Being German and just having watched my first Marlene Dietrich movie, I also feel that I must address her: She's a little overacting on several occasions.

Even though one has a 60 year advantage over the other, Witness for the Prosecution was an incredibly better movie.I really love it when a film gets me so caught up that I feel at the same time worried and excited about what it's happening. It starts slowly with a calm slow pace, setting up the plot very similarly as the Sherlock Holmes cases, and at the same time Sir Wilfrid becomes irreversibly involved with the case I was unaware of how much I myself became involved in the plot. Superb movie.",Witness for the Prosecution
229,peter-beaves,Great plot but some odd acting,6,1 September 2021,"A typical Agatha Christie twisty plot with much to enjoy. Some puzzles aside from the deliberate ones though. How did the character Leonard Vole, who met the Marlene Dietrich character in Germany while serving in the British army, acquire an American accent (he was played by Tyrone Power) for example? Marlene Dietrich at one point played a cockney woman so atrociously that she would have fooled no one, and appeared to be channelling a witch from Macbeth. No wonder she didn't get the Oscar nomination she expected! Also Tyrone Power's shocking overacting can only partially be excused as we find out his character is lying a lot of the time. That Charles Laughton's barrister was supposedly convinced of Vole's innocence by this overacting actually made me laugh.You don't expect great depth or human insight from an Agatha Christie story and you won't find any in this film, but is an interesting example of fifties Hollywood cinema and quite good fun and worth watching just for Charles Laughton's performance.",Witness for the Prosecution

(There is one line from the film that still sends shivers up my spine - and I have probably seen it more than 20 times!)Laughton is superb, and at his best when matched with wife Lanchester. Tyrone Power does a good job too but is not quite in Laughton's class.

234,vvvallaton,Murder trial with great humor.,8,28 July 2005,"I didn't have any expectations about this movie except that i saw ""Sunset Boulevard"" awhile ago and that was a great movie. This movie is one of the greatest court room movies i have seen. Not only because the court room sequence here stays in reasonable length but it also makes a little fun of the whole process. There's great humor in the movie though the subject is very serious indeed. Very often the court room cases are so serious and dull but here Wilder makes it very enjoyable and fun and at the same time very exciting. Maybe the original book is more serious, i don't know 'cause i haven't read it but Wilder's view works great here. And the main reason is the great characters! Charles Laughton's role as a lawyer Sir Wilfrid Robarts is just fantastic. It's great when he is in the court room very serious and he is very passionate about his work but still you can see from his face that he is maybe very tired for the whole thing. And it's great in the end of the movie where he has been humiliated by Leonard Vole and viewers are just thinking that now he has had enough for the whole court room thing. But no, he is going to defend Christine Vole in her case. And there are many great moments and characters on the court room and the whole feeling is somehow very mild. Lawyers are telling jokes though it's a murder trial and the whole thing is shown also like a very much a competition between the defense and the prosecution. After all, does it matter if he is innocent or not? The most important thing is that Sir Wilfrid Robarts hate to lose. There's all the time this great hypocritical attitude present in the movie. Of course these motives have been deal with other this kind of movies also but Wilder does it here better than anyone.There are lots of great moments in this movie just like it was in ""Sunset Boulevard."" This is much more than just a murder trial. It's also about betrayal and disappointments. All the acting and storytelling here is superb and this went right to the top of 50's Hollywood movies i have seen( with Sunset Bouldevard).",Witness for the Prosecution

Powers and Dietrich were at the top of their game. If you have the choice between watching the original movie and the TV remake watch the original first.

Rene Clair's And Then There Were None, hailed as a classic, was very silly and couldn't hold a candle up to the book. Murder on the Orient Express, a story of my favorite Christie detective, Hercule Poirot, had an unsatisfactory star performance (Albert Finney), and a great supporting cast (Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, John Gielgud, etc.) went to waste. But Witness for the Prosecution triumphantly carries Christie's wit and suspense to the screen. Billy Wilder directs with style and flair, showing once again that he can master both comedy and drama. The screenplay, by Wilder and Harry Kurnitz, contains expertly balanced suspense and dry humor. The performances are a joy, notably Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Elsa Lanchester.

241,Anansi00,"If you've seen the movie, be sure to read Christie's story. If you've read the story, still see this movie.",7,21 November 2004,"Witness for the Prosecution is, as IMDb voters cann attest, a great movie. A clever, character-driven courtroom drama, it deserved the Academy Award nominations that it received in 1958, and it has justly endured to the present day. Starring the terrific talents of Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, and particularly Marlene Dietrich, directed by Billy Wilder, and based on the superb short story by Agatha Christie, it is a combination has all of the very best ingredients, and delivers a nearly outstanding film.The movie centers around Laughton's character, an aged, feisty, and very canny English barrister (lawyer) who is in poor health and headed toward retirement. The opening of the movie is entirely Laughton's show, as he portrays a curmudgeonly and endearing character. On his first day home from the hospital, he soon takes up the defense of Leonard Vole (Power) a man who is charged with murder and up against a barrage of circumstantial evidence. Power is convincing as the honest and somewhat naive defendant, in increasingly over his head. Soon, Dietrich makes her entrance as Vole's cool German femme fatal of a wife. After a few flashbacks to set up the story of the murder case, Laughton takes up Vole's case. What ensues is a well-written and well-directed courtroom drama, in which Laughton continues to shine, delivering a convincing performance peppered with humor. Soon, the story takes a series of dramatic twists, during which Power plays his part as the beleaguered defendant to the hilt and Dietrich uses the gifts that made her a legend. By the end, the audience has been treated to an excellent drama with sensational acting.The result is a classic, but not an icon in the sense that Christie's short story, penned twenty years earlier, would become. While it may be the best-regarded of all Christie adaptations (Murder on the Orient Express a possible exception), the movie does not seem to have the stature it ought to have. At the end of the movie, I did not feel the same as when I read the story, and not just because I knew all along how it would turn out. With such visible talent on all fronts, I took a long look at what it was, and what was missing. The answer: Christie. The movie is good in its own right, but from the beginning misses the crucial aspect that the original story has: the mystery. Agatha Christie is the master of suspense, and throughout the story, that suspense, that anxiousness to know what will happen next, the eagerness to know where this next twist will lead, and the shock that comes at the very end, were what the story was all about. The direction the movie went, the legal thriller, substituted drama for mystery, and while the movie only added to the story, changing very little of what Christie wrote, the movie lost the grip that only she could create. Christie treated the courtroom proceedings (the centerpiece of the movie) with brevity, focusing on the intrigue surrounding the case. Also, the Hollywood ending overdoes it a little bit, and deprives the most important plot twist of some of its its emotional impact.That said, however, the movie is still a classic. Fortunately, the heart of the story was still very strong, with a unique plot and rich characters, which were taken advantage of by Wilder and the cast, respectively. And, as it turns out, the movie is a good complement to the story. To those who have only seen the movie, the story should be read to truly appreciate the missing value of the mystery. To those who have read the story, the movie nails the characters (particularly Dietrich's Mrs. Vole). All in all, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and would gladly see it again.",Witness for the Prosecution

Alas, we must also take into account he died soon after finishing the film. Dietrich's entry is one of the best ever in films! Laughton and real life wife Lanchester are superbly cast.The ending is superb! If you have not seen the film, don't stop the tape before the credits roll! Outstanding! Final comment... why is this film not available on DVD in the UK?",Witness for the Prosecution
244,hotelpiresbr,The best of the best,10,16 February 2015,"This is an excellent movie. A movie that survived the test of time, with great performances from all actors, and is so much better than the modern films!!!!!! Tyrone Powers is great, as well as Marlene Dietrich, but Charles Laughton shines!!! The script is full of little details, and the camera work (pay attention to the camera moves) is perfect and delicate. Billy Wilder is remembered by his comedies (""Some like it hot"", ""The fortune cookie"", ""Avanti!"", ""Sabrina""), but he made some great movies in other genres like suspense and film noir (""Double indemnity"", perhaps the best and most essential film noir of all time). 10/10.–",Witness for the Prosecution

Well they need to make up a new word in order to properly praise this film. Absolutely speechless after this one. Must see for yourself. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie, and just sat and looked at the black screen smiling for 20 minutes when it was over. I can't possibly explain in words how much I enjoyed watching this movie. I am only 26 so I know there are many movies I have not seen, but I will find it very difficult searching for one better. The way everything gels together is remarkable. At the end you're left asking and answering your own questions.",Witness for the Prosecution
247,Cracklinrosie,TURNS & TWISTS!,9,16 February 2004,This is a wonderful film with lots of plot twists and turns! The acting is superb and it keeps you watching throughout. It is always a favourite when shown on UK TV. I can recommend it.  Charles Laughton is perfect as the Barrister for the defence! His real wife Elsa Lanchaster played his nurse. Very good!,Witness for the Prosecution
248,nikolas-grigoriou,A remarkable movie,9,21 October 2018,"'Witness for the Prosecution' is a remarkable movie. The movie storyline and plot differs a lot from other similar trial movies. The movie concerns a veteran British barrister, who decides to take action on a murder case that seems promising. By watching the movie, you dive into a unique British contest, socially, politically, verbally.As the movie progresses, and while the barrister tries to defend his client, new clues come into the light and every time the trial is extended, which makes the case even more challenging. There are small details during the movie that are critical to the narrative and the plot. There is a major plot twist just before the ending.",Witness for the Prosecution
249,caliadragon,Witness for Prosecution,10,12 April 2005,"This movie is truly gripping. The actors involved are top of the line and they all have the ability transport the viewer into the film and make you forget your surroundings. This movie is worth watching. I am not a fan of Agatha Christie, but this movie is one of my favorites. Charles Laughton makes this movie. He is what drew me to the movie to begin with. I was not disappointed.Marlene Deitrich and Tyrone Power play their rolls to the max and manage to play both the jury and the audience to the end.This movie is well worth watching.",Witness for the Prosecution

Get set ready for the ride.",Witness for the Prosecution
251,slam21c,A movie to watch right till the end,10,17 October 2000,"This movie is just fantastic.  I first saw it years ago, but everytime I see it I still enjoy it thoroughly.  All the cast work well together.  Tyrone Power is great in his last movie before his untimely death.  Although I'm not a fan of Marlene Dietrich, she was great in this movie.  Apart from the intriguing storyline, the highlight of the movie must be Charles Laughton and his wonderfully witty wife, Elsa Lancaster.  Their dialogue just bounces off one another so effortlessly.  The ending has a twist as most courtroom dramas do but you still don't expect it when it happens.  All in all a must see movie!",Witness for the Prosecution

The whole cast compliment each other perfectly, especially Elsa Lanchester, Charles Laughton and Tyrone Power.  Marlene dietrich turns in an oscar worthy performance, but i can't tell you why!!!  At the end of the film a voice-over tells you to keep it a secret, please i urge you to watch this film, if only for the last ten minutes!!!!!  You wouldn't believe Dietrich could pull it off.",Witness for the Prosecution
253,sounakchakraborty,In single word Outstanding.,10,13 March 2021,One of the greatest creations of Billy Wilder. Fantastic film with one of the most shocking endings. Every main actors and actresses did an amazing job.,Witness for the Prosecution
254,RvdW1,A movie to remember,10,4 December 2020,"""Witness for the Prosecution"" is one of those movies that is really worth your time. A genius legal drama that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, with an outstanding performance of Marlene Dietrich as a strong and cunning leading lady. In every scene she commands the room and pulls focus like no other. Matching her in that energy is Charles Laughton playing a fenomal barrister who takes on what might be the most interesting case of his career. The movie excels at portraying the intricate storyline and keeps the viewer eager to find out what happens next. Definitely a strong recommendation and instantly one of my all time favourite movies.Also worth mentioning is the loveable role of Miss. Plimsoll played by an endearing Elsa Lanchester.",Witness for the Prosecution
255,welsh49,Amazing,10,29 July 2003,"Having a rather eclectic taste in films, this one ranks as one of the most enjoyable.  From superior acting of the lead characters to the plot twists. This movie takes you on a ride that has you speculating motives, and finally, you are left with your mouth open.  This Hitchcock genre is one of his best!!",Witness for the Prosecution
256,mystic9121,"Response to ""flaw"" claimed in comment",10,9 September 2007,"One review above claims a flaw, in that Christine Helm (Dietrich) never actually committed perjury (true!!!! ) and therefore she should not have accepted her fate so readily, implying that her murder of Vole is manslaughter only and therefore defensible. Helm claims correctly that she had never testified that what she had written in the letters was the truth, merely that she had written them. Christie exploits this assumption by the jury brilliantly and credibly, and is a diabolically clever plot twist. But I don't see it as a flaw. I see it as a way for the audience to assume that Lanchester realizes this very wiggle room is her justification for suggesting Laughton defend Dietrich instead of going to Bermuda on vacation. I have seen this movie masterpiece many many times,and always forget exactly how the denouement is reached, and always enjoy analyzing how Christie brilliantly always remained one step ahead of the reader.",Witness for the Prosecution
257,jimduffy52,An Underrated Classic,10,29 August 2005,"I first saw this film on TV in the mid-60's when I was a young teen. I loved it then and saw it several more times over the years, most recently on one of the old movie channels. I still love it. The surprise twist would not be as effective today as it was in the 50's when major stars almost never played the murderer.I have, at least, scanned the previous reviews. I agree with many of you that this film ranks as one of Billy Wilder's masterpieces. I also thought that Charles Laughton stole the picture with his performance as the curmudgeonly barrister. Of course, he had most of the best lines. Marlene Dietrich delivers an amazing performance. She was not always a very good actress, although this may have something to do with the types of parts she was offered.Tyrone Power gave a very good performance - although I felt he looked too old for the part. Vole was supposed to be a fairly young man. Power was 43 or so and looked older and quite unhealthy, not surprising since he died of a heart ailment within a year or so of filming. Getting past that, I thought his performance was quite effective - especially if you keep in mind the twist at the end. Leonard Vole was lying all the time. Power was not a great actor by any means but he did a very good job in this film. Many users have commented on how bad Power looked and how good Marlene Dietrich looked for a 50-something woman. Marlene was only about 2.5 years younger than Laughton. He certainly looked much older than 58. Of course, he was playing older but I noticed he looked much older in his later pictures like Spartacus and Advise and Consent.By the way, some users commented on Power's American accent. This might not have been due to his limitations as an actor. He was certainly capable of a creditable Irish accent in the ""Long Gray Line"". However, studios generally did not like to have major male stars attempt accents in those days. Even as recently as ""Out of Africa"", the Robert Redford was told not to try an English accent. The director was afraid people would be distracted by Redford attempting an English accent.",Witness for the Prosecution
258,randlecrz,Witness For the Prosecution,10,22 August 2015,"I truly enjoyed this picture. It was very well done, Marlene Dietrich did an excellent job. She is a very talented actress. I have also always enjoyed Tyrone Power, his performance was flawless I didn't find any cracks in this movie st all. Charles Laughton was also at his best. He added levity to a very sinister situation, the back and forth between he and his nurse are priceless. You start out not liking her very much and wanting her to leave the man be so he can do his job, but somehow she manages to worm her way into your heart I thought I had it all figured out right from the beginning and all while I watched I just knew I was right. Well let me say I was surprised, turned out I was completely off the mark. I highly recommend this movie. It is a true classic...two thumbs up",Witness for the Prosecution

Of the few tributes of his life that I have heard so far, none have mentioned this masterpiece which ranks in my top 10 movies of all time.  Charles Laughton as the cantankerous yet crafty courtroom attorney.  Marlene Dietrich as the femme fatale.  At times you pity her and at others you hate her - I won't give away the sequence because that would ruin one of the MANY surprises to this twister.  Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's real-life wife, is uniquely qualified for her role as the only one who can stand up to him as his nurse and their reparte is a welcome whimsical distraction from the tension in this remarkable piece of work. Tyrone Power puts in one of his best performances.",Witness for the Prosecution

267,scott-buchanan,What a movie!,10,1 September 2004,"A film I have not seen for years but will always remember with fondness. A classic thriller with all the right ingredients - Power and Dietrich are spectacular, and, by early standards (and recent ones!), the twist is excellent. Charles Laughton however, provides us with a glib chuckle as the aging defense attorney ruled by his overlord maid. A distraction that only adds to an excellent plot line.I can't imagine another film of the genre and the era, that so wickedly entangles the essential thriller with a 'crime of passion' (oops, spot the plot killer...) gem. A classic. A film for true movie lovers. Take it from me!",Witness for the Prosecution
268,pericles75,Charles Laughton's Genius,9,15 February 2013,"In case anyone's interested, Laughton and Henry Daniell worked together previously in 1944 in a taut, suspenseful film noir called The Suspect (please see the write-up on IMDb elsewhere). Daniell seemed to specialize at playing cads and lousy men; and in this, he succeeded very well.Charles Laughton was a brilliant actor, perhaps one of the best of all time. He had a great voice, complete control of his body movement and the soul of a true artist. Alas, he was not without flaws, a controversial figure in his day. For a more complete treatment of his life and work, please see Simon Callow's ""Charles Laughton: A Difficult Actor,"" (1987). The book is an interesting read and fills in many details for the concerned viewer. His book- reading tours of America were very popular. To hear him read works from the Bible, from Shakespeare, et al. were joyful experiences. Please see Charles Laughton, The Story Teller on the internet.BTW I do disagree that Power was wrong for the role of Leonard Vole. After all, he still had some of, or most of his 1940s looks and would have to be right to attract Norma Varden's age.One other thought: based on what happens at the end of ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" I wonder whether Sir Wilfred ever collects his fee.",Witness for the Prosecution
269,alicat821,Marlene Dietrich' vs Madeline Khan,10,8 September 2007,"After watching this movie for the first time, the only thing that jumped out at me was that of Mel Brook's movie Blazing Saddles. The impersonation of Madeline's Kahns role of Lilly Von Schtoop had Miss D. down to perfection. She had everything down from the body language to the famous lisp. I am convinced that Miss Kahn studied her from this movie and Blue Angel-------just brilliant---I'm Tired-----Tired of being admired. The other comment was the double role done. I really was confused by the lady with the letters but had no idea it was Miss D. Mr. Laughton seems to enjoy working with his wife had it showed. I did recognize Ruta Lee and thought she would have a bigger part in this plot and I was right at the end. I thought Mr . Power had over-acted--- but fooled me in the end.------ Kudo's Billy Wilder",Witness for the Prosecution
270,johnnykay07,An all time classic,10,26 November 2006,"Although it has been a long time since I have seen this movie, it remains in my mind as one of the best I have ever seen. The interaction of the characters without the benefit, or should I say, distraction of special & sound effects, is remarkable. Charles Laughton & Marlene Dietrich do full justice to their characters and it is difficult to determine who is the star and who is providing support. The story line does what a truly great suspense mystery should do. It builds the story through a series of escalating points and keeps the viewers in absolute suspense until the climax which, when it comes, provides a complete and proper conclusion to the plot.Thank you for a wonderful experience.",Witness for the Prosecution
271,seekyq-975-442287,Masterpiece of suspense movies,9,15 April 2014,"This movie is fantastic. It's the first time I have seen that with an ending that tell the audiences not to give spoilers of the story. Knowing that it was released in 1957, makes the movie more impressive. It's black and white. But this has no negative effect on the fun of watching it.In the very beginning, I was afraid that the movie would be boring or something, I wondered if I could make it to the end of the movie. But it proved to exceed my expectation by a mile. In fact, I considered it was a milestone in the history of suspense movies.You won't feel bored watching it. Even the common dialogues are fun. The actors were also outstanding in their roles. They interpreted the movie in such a sophisticated manner.The author of the movie, Agatha Christie, created a logically exciting plots with a surprising ending. People nowadays may think the ending is nothing special. But, as I mentioned before, it's really a milestone that inspired other authors and directors who imitated or expended this style of story telling.Recently, there was a popular Chinese movie named ""Silent Witness"" which was rated the ""best movie"" in China in 2013. Frankly, it wasn't a bad movie. But if you have ever seen Witness for the Prosecution you will spot lots of common plot points and scenarios which was shared by both - -- it's pretty amazing, after being released about 60 years, it is still inspiring current movie makers.While watching Witness for the Prosecution, I was struggled the fact that the casts were mostly dead. Which is very sad. But on the other hand, the left a legacy that continues to inspire excellent work.",Witness for the Prosecution

This Movie is an ideal combination of Perfect Storyline {Hats off to the Great Agatha Christie}, fantastic Screenplay, brilliant direction and last but not the least a highly proficient acting by Charles Laughton & Marlene Dietrich. I have read most of the books of Agatha Christie and I am a huge fan of her writings. I have seen some of the movies based on her books like Murder in the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, Ten little Indians and Evil Under the Sun. After watching these movies, as most of us feel that Original Books are better than adapted movies, I too felt the same. It will be unjust on my part to term these Adapted movies as Bad but they were no comparison to the High standards set by Agatha in her respective books. But this one is different. Each and every scene of this movie is so well scripted and directed that it was impossible for me to keep off my eyes from the screen even for a second. The complete courtroom drama and final twist in the ending [ I am not a spoiler here so don't worry :) ] is fabulous. This Movie I would say is a very Nice representation of Agatha's writings and lives up to her standards so please do not miss it... watch it.",Witness for the Prosecution
