0,Leofwine_draca,"Slightly better than the first adaptation, but only slightly.",5,28 February 2020,"While PET SEMATARY is one of my favourite Stephen King novels, it doesn't seem to adapt to the screen very well. I didn't care for the 1989 version and this updating is little better. What's good about it is the material taken from the novel, which transfers well to screen, and the cast, headed by decent performances from Jason Clarke and John Lithgow as the men involved with the spookiness close to their home. Sadly, given that this is the 21st century, they decided to update the story with needless changes and extra characters who merely befuddle the narrative and lessen the impact. I did appreciate the darkness of the climax, which seeks to out-MIST THE MIST, and the cat's appearance is done well. But that CGI tanker effect is a shocker and the cinematography is adequate at best.",Pet Sematary
1,SnoopyStyle,thin,5,25 January 2020,"Louis Creed (Jason Clarke), his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), and their children, Ellie and Gage, move from Boston to Ludlow, Maine. Jud Crandall (John Lithgow) is their new neighbor. At the back of their property in the woods, there is a ""Pet Sematary"" and beyond that, there is something darker.As a horror, it lacks tension except for a few short stretches. The mood can be best described as fake spookiness. Rachel has an interesting backstory which suggests that she is the better protagonist. I like her trouble with death. Since they're changing up the story anyways, I would have liked her as the one to bring back the dead. Her troubled history would give real depth to her troubled mind. It would give this simple Stephen King story much needed layers. This is simply too thin.",Pet Sematary
2,claudio_carvalho,Another Unnecessary Remake,6,6 July 2019,"1989 ""Pet Sematary"" is one of the creepiest horror films ever made based on Stephen King´s novel and screenplay. It may be considered a masterpiece of horror and cruelty.""Pet Sematary (2019)"" is not a bad horror movie since the storyline is creepy and the screenplay and the cast are good. However, it is absolutely unnecessary to remake a masterpiece with minor modifications, isn´t it? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Cemitério Maldito"" (""Damned Cemitery"")",Pet Sematary
3,nogodnomasters,We are family,8,16 April 2019,"Dr. Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) moves his family from Boston to the small town of Ludlow. His wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) is already haunted by her past. John Lithgow plays the kindly neighbor Judson Cranbell. I find it hard to imagine if there is anybody who doesn't know the basic plot. We know what happens, but they opted to change up the ending, which I actually liked. And I would have loved if they had played Sly and the Family Stone's ""We are Family"" during the final credit roll, except there were not any light moments in the film.My main criticism is that it took an hour to get to where we knew where it was going. After that, they took the film on a roller coaster ride instead of feeding us bits of horror and doubt about what happens next. Dead Ellie (Jeté Laurence) plays her hand too soon.Guide: 1 F-word, I caught. No sex or nudity.",Pet Sematary
4,kosmasp,Resurected,8,10 May 2019,"If this is your biggest dissapointment in 2019 - or any other year for that matter - be grateful. You had a good year. Unless this was the only movie you watched. Still believe me there are far worse movies out there. Popcorn consumption does not make a movie good or bad (I personally try to eat as much popcorn before the movie begins, so I make less noise during the movie) and if you hadn't figured out that they put the best bits in the trailer, you are quite gullible and I really like your innocence.Having said all that (and trying to be as general as possible), the remake is quite good. If you suspend your disbelief. As with the Original you will wonder about decisions characters make (like the neighbor or the father), but they are necessary even if completely insane to say the least. Effects are pretty good, there is less a focus on the wife (though obviously she still plays a major role) and there are also some other small twists and changes. This seems more focused and you may like that or not - in general it stays with the spirit of the source material and the original movie while not copying it one to one - which is a good thing",Pet Sematary
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"An average adaptation, that's visually good, but lacks the essence of the book.",5,20 March 2021,"I can't say I'm a massive fan of the original adaptation, but I am a huge fan of the book.My overall interpretation of this movie, is that it's pretty tasteless, I won't add any spoilers, but one or two of the scenes were a bit much, not that I'm squeamish or sensitive, but this just wasn't the tone or spirit of the book.It's well made, it's well acted, and very nicely produced, some of the imagery is great, particularly at the cemetery, and the scenes involving the cat.It's watchable, it's not bad, but compared to the book, it's just about average, 5/10.",Pet Sematary
6,classicsoncall,"""I'm dead, aren't I?""",7,9 September 2019,"It appears 2019 is the year for Stephen King based movie remakes with ""It Chapter 2"" opening just this past weekend (as I write this), and the updated ""Pet Sematary"" released just a few months ago in April. It's been almost three years since I've seen the 1989 original utilizing Stephen King's screenplay, but to the best of my recollection, the current version strikes me as the creepier one, primarily because of the switch in the story of the family member who suffered the vehicle fatality. In the prior picture, it was three year old Gage who died and was brought back to life, while in this version, sister Ellie suffers the same fate and is resurrected via the eerie atmospherics of the Creed's backyard 'pet sematary'. This film probably has an overall stronger cast as well, as the adult Creed's are portrayed by veteran film actors versus the television personalities who appeared earlier. As for the character of Jud Crandall, I guess John Lithgow compared against Fred Gwynne will probably be a toss up for fans of either actor, and I liked them both in each rendition of the movie.The thing that really impressed me here was young actress Blaze Berdahl in the role of Ellie Creed. After she returned from the dead, her facial features, particularly the eyes, were distorted in a manner that really gave you the chills. Those creepy eyes out of synch made her look effectively zombie-like. If you paid attention as the viewer, there was also a neat reference to the King novel ""Cujo"", when a television news clip refers to a big Saint Bernard killing four people. That was a cool nod to long time Stephen King fans.Apparently my opinion isn't shared by the bulk of IMDb reviewers, as this one clocks in with a 5.8 rating while the 1989 flick comes in with a 6.6. It also has about thirty thousand less viewer ratings than the original, so perhaps the passage of time might have a way of equalizing opinions. In any case, one oversight was corrected with this picture, as the identities of the four cats who portrayed Church were all given screen credits on the IMDb full cast page. The creepy kitty in the original picture probably needed a better agent, as the identity of that cat never made the cut.",Pet Sematary
7,jboothmillard,Pet Sematary,5,16 November 2020,"The original 1980s version, based on the book by Stephen King, is a strange but reasonable scary movie, and I was intrigued when I saw the trailer for a modern remake, I was looking forward to seeing how it compares. Basically, Louis Creed (Jason Clarke), an emergency physician from Boston, Massachusetts, has moved with his family, wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) and their children Ellie (Jeté Laurence) and Gage (twins Hugo and Lucas Lavoie), to the small town of Ludlow, Maine. Exploring the woods, Rachel, and Ellie stumble across a cemetery for dead pets called ""Pet Sematary""They also meet and befriend their neighbour Jud Crandall (John Lithgow). At the University of Maine hospital, Louis is left shaken after failing to save the life of student Victor Pascow (Obssa Ahmed), who was fatally injured after being struck and dragged by a vehicle. Louis later experiences a vivid vision of Victor leads him to the area at the back of the cemetery and warns him not to ""venture beyond"". Louis wakes and assumes this was a nightmare, but he finds his feet covered in mud, suggesting the events really happened. On Halloween, Ellie's cat, Winston Churchill, or ""Church"", is killed by a truck. Jud takes Louis past the pet cemetery to an ancient burial ground to bury Church. The next day, Louis is stunned when Church returns home alive, though he is different: aggressive and violent, appearing dirty and a never-ending stench. Jud tells Louis he did not want to see a child emotional after the death of a pet, so she helped them. He reveals that the burial ground brings things back from the dead, but he apologises, as he thought Church would return the same. After Church attacks Gage, Louis unsuccessfully attempts to euthanise him and instead decides to set him free in the wild, telling Ellie that he ran away. During her birthday party, Gage is not being looked after and wanders towards the road, and there, Ellie spots Church on the road and excitedly rushes to him. Gage is saved from harm, but Ellie is hit and killed by a speeding truck that derails its tanker. The family is heartbroken, and Rachel and Gage leave to spend a few days with Rachel's parents. Sensing that Louis is planning on resurrecting Ellie, Jud warns the grieving father that ""sometimes dead is better"". Victor's spirit also warns him about the consequences, but Louis is overwhelmed with grief which spurs him to carry out his plan. He drugs Jud, exhumes Ellie's corpse, and reburies her in the burial ground beyond animal graveyard. Ellie rises from the dead, and Louis is relieved to have his daughter back from the dead, but he is forced to continually calm her down as she manifests a disturbing demeanour. Meanwhile, Rachel is frightened by visions of her dead sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine), who suffered from spinal meningitis and died after falling down a dumbwaiter shaft. When Jud wakes, he sees Ellie in the house, and rushes home in horror to grab a gun. But Jud is distracted by Church growling, allowing Ellie to surprise him, slicing through his foot with a scalpel before viciously stabbing him to death. Rachel and Gage return home and encounter the undead Ellie. Rachel is horrified and flees with Gage, enraging Ellie for being rejected; she tries to attack them, while Louis finds Jud's blood-soaked body. Rushing home, Louis manages to save Gage and locks him in the car. Ellie fatally stabs Rachel, and in her last moments, she begs her husband not to bury her in the cursed ground. Ellie knocks Louis unconscious and drags her mother's body to the burial ground. At the pet cemetery, Ellie tries to kill Louis. As Louis prepares to decapitate his daughter, he is impaled by a weathervane by a reanimated Rachel and is subsequently buried as she was. Along with Church, the undead trio set fire to Jud's house. They the approach the car with Gage inside, with a resurrected Louis peering inside, before the sound of the car unlocking is heard, and it cuts to black. Also starring Maria Herrera as Marcella, Frank Schorpion as Rachel's Father, Linda E. Smith as Rachel's Mother, and Sonia Maria Chirila as Young Rachel. All the elements made the original morbid but a compulsive story remain, with dead pets and children buried in a place to come back as nasty killer zombies, the major changes are that is the daughter killed, rather than the toddler, and the darker ending. The dream and flashback sequences in-between slow it down the slightest bit, but it does feel slightly bleaker and a macabre atmosphere, the undead cat popping up is creepy, the changes to make it surprising, and it does get your nerves jangling when it needs to, a reasonable supernatural horror. Worth watching!",Pet Sematary
8,paul_haakonsen,This was an abysmal remake... Oh. Dear. Lord...,3,11 May 2019,"I loved the 1989 ""Pet Sematary"", so I must admit that I was dreading this remake once it was announced. I had my hopes, for sure, but given the track records of how the endless stream of Hollywood remakes tend to fail and become horrible movies, then I had my fears for this remake as well.And this 2019 remake can be summarized with just three words; Oh. My. God.I wanted to like this Stephen King remake. I did. I really did. But there was next to nothing that appealed to me in it. Sad to say so, but it is true.Yeah, it was abysmal. Not only because it was almost a frame-by-frame copy paste job, which was a major setback for the movie. Sure they added new stuff, but it was just too much copy-paste for me to be enjoyable. But also because this felt like it was one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made. It was just atrocious.The only things that made this movie bearable to watch was the production level, John Lithgow and Church (the cat). Everything else was just bland and essentially just filling.Zelda in this 2019 remake was just a faceless character, whom lacked everything that the Zelda character in the 1989 version had. The 2019 Zelda wasn't scary, she wasn't memorable, she wasn't much of anything really. She definitely didn't scare me at all, whereas the Zelda in the 1989 version still gives me goosebumps when I think of her appearance, her demeanor and her voice. That was a massive fail for the 2019 remake.Granted, I haven't read the novel, so I am not in possession of the knowledge whether Pascow is Caucasian or Afro-American, but he was Caucasian in the 1989 version and Afro-American in the 2019 remake. If the character in the book is Afro-American then yay, good for getting it right. But if he was Caucasian in the book, why change it for the 2019 remake? Is Hollywood really that whipped under the 'politically-correct-and-scared-to-offend-anyone' dogma?Again, holding on to deviations from the 1989 version, then in the 2019 remake it is the daughter Ellie that dies on the road, not the son Gaige. Once more, I haven't read the book, so I don't know whom it was that Stephen King made die in the traffic accident. Great, if they made it true to the book, but it is was changed just because the director felt like it, not that much of a good choice.Directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer haven't exactly made a memorable remake here. In fact, quite the opposite. I want to forget about ever seeing this movie as fast as possible, and just let its existence fade into oblivion. The 1989 version is superior in every aspect.If you talk about pointless remakes that never should have made it off of the concept idea drawing board, then the 2019 ""Pet Sematary"" is definitely one of the high ranking movies.",Pet Sematary
9,BandSAboutMovies,Forgettable at best,4,6 June 2019,"I must confess that I have no love whatsoever for the 1989 version of Pet Sematary other than Fred Gwynne's famous line read of ""Sometimes, dead is better."" When I saw it in the theater, it felt paced and read like a comedy when it certainly shouldn't. For all the movies made from King's works, it's not amongst my favorites.When the new film was introduced and it was continually referred to as a more frightening version - some early views by critics even promised a lot of shocking material - I was interested. I'd enjoyed Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer film Starry Eyes (not so much the movie Holidays, another contribution to the 2010's history of ruining the portmanteau genre), so there seemed to be some promise.
Louis Creed (Jason Clark, who was also in the abysmal Winchester) has taken his young family from Boston to the much smaller town of Ludlow where he plans on being a small town doctor, away from the hustle, bustle and violence of the big city.His wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz, You're Next) has never escaped the death of her sister, Zelda, who suffered from spinal meningitis and hated her for being healthy. Left alone with her one evening, the sick girl died when she fell down a dumbwaiter shaft.Their two young children, Ellie and Gage, really enjoy having the huge woods around the house. While they explore, Ellie watches a group of children in animal masks take a dead dog to a cemetery on their land. Jud Crandall (John Lithgow!) meets the young girl and warns the family of the dangers in the woods. If this was ever expanded on - why do the kids have these masks other than it looks creepy and cool? - this would be more interesting.The story beats are the same, other than one major inversion. A young man dies on Louis' operating table, haunting him with the barrier between life and death. Church the cat dies and is brought back to life by the spirit of the Wendigo that lives inside the sour ground of the pet cemetery (or sematary, I guess). When he comes back from the dead, he's not the same, scratching at everyone and killing birds inside at the foot of the bed.The switch is that Ellie - and not Gage - is killed. That sequence, when the truck's cargo shoots out across the highway toward her, is really well shot. This is probably the highlight of the film. From here on out, it's jump scares and revisions of what came before, with a much darker ending that was probably the only other thing I enjoyed about this whole affair.Multiple versions of the ending were written and several of them were filmed, including the original ending of the book. This one got the best response from test screenings. King proposed an alternate ending, where after all the violence and bloodshed, Gage is walking up the middle of the road as a truck bears down on him. Then at the last second, a woman would yank him out of harm's way, asking, ""Where's your mommy and daddy?""I struggle to find a reason why this movie exists. Other than the flip of what child dies - and the daughter being able to be much more sinister than a younger boy - there's nothing in here that says much more than the original film. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's not a good one either. It's just kind of there. Life is too short for that. There's too much to experience, after all.",Pet Sematary
10,Coventry,"That darn, undead cat!",6,5 September 2019,"Yours truly often thinks that Stephen King is overhyped and undeservedly praised, but I'm also not too hypocrite to reckon that some of his work resulted in the finest horror movie milestones ever; - especially during the 1970s and 1980s. The original ""Pet Sematary"" perhaps wasn't on par with the absolute best (like ""Carrie"", ""The Dead Zone"" or ""Misery"") but it still stands as one of his more superior efforts, notably also because King adapted the novel into a screenplay himself. Heck, for what it's worth, I'll always have a weakness for Mary Lambert's version ""Pet Sematary"" simply because it instantly causes the magnificent song by The Ramones to pop up in my head!With King's popularity exaggeratedly booming again in recent years (thank you, new version of ""It""), another update of the modest ""Pet Sematary"" was as good as inevitable. Although they hardly ever have an added value, I'm not principally against remakes/re-interpretations and thus approached the 2019 version with an open mindset. The film by upcoming young directors Kölsch & Widmyer (""Starry Eyes"") is an entertaining time-waster with an admirably bleak and uncanny atmosphere, as well as a few effective shock-moments and strong performances, but I doubt it'll ever turn up in any ""best horror movies"" lists in the longer term. The story is still creepy and captivating after nearly 40 years. Most of the story, at least, since personally I never thought the sub plot of the wife's recurring nightmares about her nasty and crippled sister was very plausible. The menace coming from the ancient and mystical burial grounds, and the violent danger coming from the speeding heavyweight trucks, on the other hand, are very real and tangible in this film version!The rational Dr. Louis Creed moves with his family from Boston to rural Maine, hoping to settle in a quiet and peaceful community. In their backyard, however, they find a grisly burial place for neighborhood pets and the roadside is even grislier, with massive trucks thundering by non-stop. When the family cat Church - short for Churchill - becomes the victim of such a road warrior, friendly old neighbor Jud (the always reliable John Lithgow) is so worried about breaking the heart of 9-year-old daughter Ellie that he takes Louis and the dead cat to a piece of land beyond the pet cemetery. A place where inexplicably supernatural things happen to dead bodies when you bury them here. But Jud should have known better... The resurrected Church isn't the same joyful fluffy cat anymore and, moreover, she indirectly even causes for a much bigger tragedy to overcome the Creed family.Kölsch and Widmyer undeniably have talent and skills. They are effortlessly capable of making you accept a few drastic changes to the original story and simultaneously keep the 40-year-old and well-known story suspenseful. Several sequences, notably Louis and Jud's nightly excursion to the burial ground and the sudden apparitions of traffic victim Victor Pascow, are tremendously atmospheric. The finale is somewhat gratuitously violent and grotesque, but I don't think any horror fans will complain about that. In the end, ""Pet Sematary"" largely delivers the shocks and scares that it promises, and the film establishes once again what I already learned from numerous other Stephen King adaptations: don't ever settle in Maine!",Pet Sematary

Dr. Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) discovers a mysterious mound hidden deep in the woods near the family's new residence.

Hidden in the woods near the new family home, Ellie, their eldest daughter, discovers a mysterious cemetery where the pets of community members are buried.Not as bad as I was fearing it would be, but is it really any better than the original film?. Itself a simply ordinary adaptation from what is a very good book, you would have thought the 2019 version would at least bring some fresh life to the story. Yet albeit that some changes have been made (one of which was moronically shown in the trailers), it's still a re-tread that has failed to entice newcomers to this world.There's some good on show, though. Child actor Jeté Laurence is excellent, particularly in the latter part of the pic. The design for the Pet Sematary and the surrounding areas are splendidly eerie, with photographer Rose deserving a better film really. While the sound work out at the special place is also bang on the tonal money.The ending has provided much division, but personally it was a change that I liked. Two writers and two directors came up with this adaptation, but they didn't get much right between them and the pic feels like a compromised cash cow. Stick with the book and get The Ramones album of the same name instead. 6/10",Pet Sematary

18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Underwhelming if still watchable sequel effort,4,11 January 2020,"Moving to a quiet Maine town, a doctor and his family try to get settled into their new home, but when an accident threatens to shatter their lives he puts his knowledge of a secret local burial ground to use only to thrust his family into a far darker nightmare when it starts to turn against him.This one wasn't so bad but was pretty troubling. Among the more enjoyable aspects here is the setup of the main burial ground which is hidden away in the woods. These scenes are generally atmospheric, showing off the tranquility of nature very well with the scenes of the kids going through the woods or the daughter investigating on her own which makes for some atmospheric settings. As well, the film works incredibly well with the resurrection of the various beings that come back, providing some creepy elements and aspects here from the antics of the returning cat attacking the family and trying to covertly get rid of it to the stalking by the resurrected kid both on the neighbor in his house or the returning family when they come back at the end. These offer up some great action that helps to enhance the overarching theme of his desperation to save them by going to the lengths he does to keep them together, which is all that works here. There are a few issues within the film. The biggest obstacle to overcome is the general unreliability of anything that takes place in the town. There's very little about the house being so close to the highway with trucks speeding by in such a residential area which is nothing more than easy foreshadowing for what's to come later yet doesn't have any kind of realistic notion that any sane driver would pull off. Likewise, the small-town appearance and attitude are completely glossed over and underwhelming with very little about the look and feel of anything here looking anywhere close to that type of setting, making for a very tough immersion into this one. On top of that, there's no explanation for how it all works, from the cemetery's ability to raise them from the dead to what's keeping the family at the house to why they're not able to notice the changes around them when the reanimated beings start acting weird despite not having any prior motivation to behave that way. The other real issue here is the film's inability to effectively utilize any of its horror elements with any kind of merit. The main aspect of the film half involves the mothers' fear of death through her past experiences with her ill sister, an element of the film with absolutely no scares present here because of the ineffectual flashbacks. They're over so quick and manage to gloss over any kind of normal rationale for being scared as the few glimpses don't generate anything while the later attempt to use that to build a phobia of cabinets is laughably absurd and reeks of trying to shoehorn scares into the film. The haunted house elements that freak out the family and underwhelming and dropped completely after awhile while the finale's ambiguous outcome seems to impart a feeling of incompleteness and a cheat more than anything.

19,FlashCallahan,sometimes.....leaving a film alone is better....,6,10 April 2019,"Dr. Louis Creed and his wife, Rachel, move from Boston to Stephen Kings' favourite place in the world, Maine with their two young children.The good-ish Doctor soon discovers a mysterious burial ground hidden deep in the woods near their new home.When tragedy strikes, Louis turns to his neighbour Jud, setting off a chain of events that unleashes an unspeakable evil with horrific consequences.....Made purely because IT was such a behemoth when released, Pet Sematary was the inevitable King film that was ripe for a remake....or so the studio thinks.There is no way that they would remake The Shining, Carrie, or Misery, those films are bonafide classics that have stood the test of time, and will be fondly remembered for eternity.The original Pet Sematary was a solid horror film, but released during a time when King had an adaptation released in the cinema every other month, and got lost somewhere in Maine.And while this, as a standalone film, is worth seeing, and is a solid, if uninspiring horror film, one cannot feel that they yearn for the original and Miko Hughes, who was wonderful as Gage back in 1989.Clarke is good as the torn Doctor, suffering from something that the film forgets to explain, and if you see the interactions between him and his Father-In-Law, you know that there are important scenes that were left on the cutting room floor in order to get those all important jump scares in, which to be frank, are not effective, because we have all grown numb to them.Lithgow adds some much needed class to the film, and is the blood that pumps the rest of the narrative.The writer has taken some liberties by changing the source material, and although it does add more tension in the final third, one cannot help but think that this story deals with unforgiving loss, and not being able to cope with the loss of a loved one. Now, I know that this still stands somewhat in this film, but harking back to 1989, the main arc of the film was so much more devastating.With references to The Wicker Man, The Shining, J-Horror, and even The Terminator (the score during the final act is reminiscent of that films final act), Pet Sematary 2019 is a worthwhile horror film, with some effective tension, but it also feels ever so slightly lazy, ever so devoid of that black heart that is evident in the best King adaptations, that it won't be remembered as well.Which is a shame, because the story is fantastic.There is one thing though, expect a plethora of King Stories to be resurrected in the next few years",Pet Sematary

Okay, it's not all that good, halfway it do slows down a bit but then picks up the horror again.

21,mm-39,Best horror movie of 19 so far!,10,8 April 2019,"Best horror movie of 19 so far! Refreshing movie with a story which is not spliced with over bearing nothing to do with movies development with politically correct story messages. Thankfully, there is no cheap made for t v over dramatic moments. Wisely avoids having any social awkward characters that drag the story down. Larry David would not fit well into the stories script lol! Pet Sematary is a well crafted story/horror movie which has believably well crafted character development. Pet Sematary has King's legendary story of bringing back to life the dead, with the catch of the dead being different/evil. What make's Pet Sematary work is the character development of the believable no- spiritual doctor's scientific mind could not deal with the cursed soil narrative. The wife's past guilt/spiritual belief is the counter narrative, which would take all the warnings the doctor could not understand creates character pathos. The neighbor character drives the remake forward, aka history repetes itself for the tragic story. Well directed and acted with the editor known what to omit and add to enhance for an excellent Pet Sematary remake! 10 stars.",Pet Sematary

Now, if it is to make it much better I can get it but that's hardly ever the case. With Pet Sematary though, the original was slightly better but that's mostly due to the element of surprise at that time. Thirty years later I still remembered most of the original so it's kind of comparing a movie instead of fully enjoying a new story. This remake has some differences, so it's not all a complete déjà vu, but it didn't make this one better than the original. The acting was good, the story is one we all know (that's if you read the book or saw the original movie), and the cinematography was good as well. I would recommend you'd read the book instead of watching a remake, as the books are always better.",Pet Sematary

Other than those two notable changes and pleasantries, the movie was a dud.Aside from very little heart, a rushed script and being WAY TOO darkly lit, the movie also skims over the original story and expands on places we didn't need to see. To be frank, I literally fell asleep in the theatre two maybe three times. For one, the story wasn't captivating and for another reason: (again) the movie was so dark, it was soothing to drift off to. Tsk-tsk.As for the synopsis, tweak the first one more than a few times to distinguish itself and pretty much land on the same conclusion. It's not IT worthy, but it was 10x better than the 1st Nightmare on Elm Street reboot.I was almost on board and thought it harmless, but the more I thought about it, how dark it was and how they butchered the story from the original, I downgraded my rating. Totally, 100% NOT the worst remake, but nowhere close to the top 40 or even 50.Sometimes, dead ideas are better.***Final thoughts: Still not hooked on the Wicker People Parade. It's been nearly 20 years since I read the book so I can't comment if they're in the novel and didn't see them in the original I just rewatched last night. When I saw them in the trailer for this update, I thought they were weird looking and laughed. Nothing changed when I saw them in the movie.Oh, and John Lithgow...you ain't no Fred Gwynne.

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Just not one of King's better transitioned books-to-screen,4,13 April 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDr. Louis Creed (Jason Clarke), his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), and their children Ellie (Jete Lawrence) and Gage (Hugo Lavoie) relocate to a new house out in the country. Upon their arrival, they notice a mysterious ritual being conducted by a group of children, involving wearing masks and the burying of a dead animal. Ellie also encounters Jud (John Lithgow), their elderly neighbour, who makes her aware of the 'pet sematary', a local burial patch for dead pets, set on top of an ancient Indian burial ground. After their cat dies, and Louis is forced to bury him there behind their backs, it is the beginning of a nightmarish journey into hell.And so, we have another modern day adaptation of a Stephen King book from the 1980s. Unlike Andy Mischuetti's new version of It, or the Netflix produced Gerald's Game, I took my time with getting out to give this latest new film a try, although I still made a point of going to see it. I did read the book, but I couldn't remember the story very well, and to be honest, I remember not being that keen on the original 1989 version. Thirty years after that, we have this joint collaboration between directors Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer, that manages to be, at best, a marginal improvement.Although I could remember (significant) bits and pieces of the story, there was still a lot of it that was a bit of a blur. The premise certainly has lots of potential, and it's all very intriguing, it just fails to execute itself really well, or give any sort of satisfactory resolution to any of it. You never find yourself caring for any of the characters, as none of them feel developed enough to get you to feel anything, and so in spite of some decent lead performances, nothing materialises.As far as I'm concerned, this is just one King work that just doesn't translate very well to the screen. It wasn't one of his better books, to be honest, a plot rife with promise, that just fails to deliver the outcome it could have, and this new incarnation of it offers little else than one effective jump scene to lift its output. **",Pet Sematary

27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Maybe they should have let this remake rest.,4,5 April 2019,"Two thirds of 'Pet Sematary (2019)' (and, no, that spelling never gets any less annoying to type) is, essentially, build-up. Build-up to what, you ask? Well, not all that much, to be honest. The final segment is easily the best in the film but, even there, there's nothing remotely close to scary. The feature runs on themes of 'grief as horror' - which are, in general, quite interesting and, even, under-explored - but it doesn't do all that much with them, stumbling over its messages and character motives in pretty much every scene. There are so many things that don't really make sense, to the point that their inclusion is questionable. I'm not talking about 'plot-holes', per se; rather, a mishmash of generic horror concepts which have no real place in the plot. Most of the actual 'horror' is haphazardly cobbled together from worn-out tropes and tired clichés, thrown into the first two acts so that the audience 'doesn't get bored'. That isn't a solution, though. The solution would have been to restructure the entire affair, to focus more on the aspects of grief that are so close to being... something. Instead, we have a generic concept (I mean, it was generic in the 80s, to be frank) that's executed generically; every aspect is done in the most contrived way possible, to the point that it almost seems by design. Even the family dynamic feels under-cooked, probably because the flick rushes through its scenes but drags out its plot. The cinematography is also muddy and, often, overly-dark, giving the picture an indistinct and generally dull appearance. To top it all off, Clarke is uncharismatic, acting pretty much the same no matter the circumstances. If it wasn't for Lithgow, the movie would be in deep trouble. Look, it's not terrible. It's competently constructed and has a decently tense final act. It isn't scary, though, not even thematically. It's predictable, generic and, frankly, it's quite boring for quite a while. Maybe they should have let this remake rest. 4/10",Pet Sematary
28,bowmanblue,A reasonable remake,7,27 April 2020,"I've always been a fan of Stephen King's original book-to-film adaptation of 'Pet Sematery;' it was a very competent horror which, although having numerous plot-strands that were kind of glossed over or not given the time they deserved, was still very memorable and had plenty of creepy and gory moments. Since Stephen King's 'IT' was remade it seemed that many other of his classics would, starting with 'Pet Sematery.'I happened to watch this remake straight after sitting through the original. I was actually surprised at how closely the new version followed the eighties incarnation. You get the same named characters moving to the new house in the American countryside, opposite the same neighbour and finding the same secretive 'Pet Sematery' (misspelt due to children creating it) where the father of the family, 'Lewis' (Jason Clarke) feels forced to bury the family's pet cat after he falls foul of a lorry on the nearby road. Naturally, things don't go too well after that and the once-treasured animal returns from the grave with more than just a taste for a mouse or two.It's only at about the three-quarters of the way through mark that the film starts to take on a feel of its own and dares to throw us die-hard 'Pet Sematery' fans a few curved balls when things start to happen that don't in either the book, nor the film.I can imagine people who haven't seen the original enjoying this film. It's a perfectly competent little horror film. Yes, it's no masterpiece, but there's enough here for any casual horror fan to enjoy. Then, for us fans of the eighties version, the first three quarters just kind of retread what we already know, before then changing enough up to make things different enough to be worth a watch. I'm perfectly happy with the remake, but, due to nostalgia reasons, I'd always choose the original over the remake. Jon Lithgow adds some acting heavyweight as the lovable next door neighbour 'Judd,' however he'll never be able to deliver his lines in as memorable way as the original 'Judd,' played perfectly by Fred Gwynn (and immortalised for his performance in 'South Park').",Pet Sematary
29,ThomasDrufke,Too Dang Depressing,6,23 April 2019,"I'm of the belief that horror has had a resurgence over the last 2-3 years, it just seems like they are given more attention and care than they were 10 years ago. Pet Sematary is certainly a case of better filmmakers behind and in front of the camera than this type of movie would have had, but it doesn't necessarily mean the film did its job. It's undeniably well-made movie, but I was unaware of just how dark and depressing this story really is. I never saw the original adaptation nor did I read Stephen King's book, so I wasn't really all that prepared for the direness of where this story eventually goes. And I guess my question is, what's the point of it all? Is it just that you shouldn't try to bring people back to life and accept death when it comes? It's well directed and acted, and a nicely made film overall, but I couldn't really get behind the end result. But maybe that's just me.6.8/10",Pet Sematary
30,ironhorse_iv,"You're right, movie! Sometimes dead is better. This remake was disappointing. It was not good.",5,8 June 2019,"Don't get me wrong, the original 1989 movie adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name was pretty terrible too. However, at least that film's cheesy bad acting & awful dated special effects is so unintentional hilarious that it's semi entertaining. This 2019 motion picture directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer was well shot, did had better acting, make up work and special effects; but the approach to the film's tone was all wrong. Like the novel, the movie was very unpleasantly bleak for general horror audiences to watch just to have a good time. After all, most fans just want to see their favorite flawed character survive a gruesome struggle; while also having those extreme antagonistic individuals meet their end. Sadly, this movie doesn't do that. Most of the people in this feature are hardly worth rooting for. Those who were, sadly got axed off. Thus leaving the audience to follow unlikeable individuals that really overstay their welcome. One such example was Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) the doctor trying to bring the dead back alive after the death of a family member. Since the movie didn't developed his strained relationship with patriarch figures nor much of his backstory struggles with PTSD. Louis was not a compelling sympatric protagonist. Also the individual's behavior throughout the film seem kinda odd. He's distance, alienation and awkward. Even with the increase focus of time on the father/daughter relationship, there still isn't much charm or passion from him. He was believable as a father figure. Clarke effectively dully underplays Louis for majority of the film. It was not the right approach. Instead, he should had been lively in the beginning and slowly turn into a depressing mess by the end of the film. Sadly, we don't get that. As for Amy Seimetz as the wife, Rachel. The actress was magnificent. I really believe that Rachel was frightened by visions of her dead sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine). It feel authentic. Plus, her character was somewhat friendly and relatable. I really do believe, she could had been the heroine of the story rather than the main lead. However, screenwriter Jeff Buhler didn't fit her sister scenes more closely to the main story. The spirits haunting Rachel miles away in Boston seem somewhat unrelated. It felt like we were watching two different movies. Just like the novel, the film was cramming too many ideas into one. Things like why the ghost was warning the family were left unanswered. After all, Vincent Pascow (Obssa Ahmed) had no relations with them. Along with that, was how the resurrecting corpse was able to change bodily form to haunt another individual near the climax without Louis's noticing its absence? The film wants us to believe it was the powers from off screen spirit of the Wendigo, but there wasn't any signs of that ability nor any cannibalism in this film. It was a bit confusing. Because of the lack of connection, many of these ideas don't mesh well. At least, they did cut down on some of novels bigger fillers like Timmy Baterman & Hanratty the Bull to only mentions. Those characters sure wasn't needed. Another thing, I like about the screenplay was the nods to King's other works, even if some of them were not cleverly place, such as the killer Saint Bernard reference at a children birthday party. I wish, there were some more Meta references and jokes like the Derry sign in this. Regardless, Buhler did improve some of the lines from the novel to fit better in the film, such as powerful 'let god take his own kids'. Still, in the end, there was several instances where the film robs us of any opportunity to experience anything thought provoking. One such example is the climax. Not ending on a good ambiguous note like the novel was a big mistake. Not only was downright depressing. It was lackluster as hell. Regardless, the action scenes involving the eight year old villain was a like more believable than the cheesy original film with a three year old living corpse. It's just sucks that the trailer and movie poster kinda ruin the twist involving the children. It could had been a cool surprise. Despite that, the actress that plays undead daughter Ellie was acceptable even if the character's cyanotic corpse body should had been more broken and mangled from the crash, so that it can mirror what happen to Zelda and give Rachel more grief. It's just that Jeté Laurence as alive Ellie that I have a problem with. She was given some really awkward dry lines to say, mostly toward her mother & friendly neighbor, Jud Crandall (John Lithgow). Their farfetched relationship felt forced and formula rather than organic. I really find it hard that Ellie would be friends with him, and for her family to allow their young daughter to hang out a lonely old man. Nevertheless, Lithgow was still fine in the role. Plus, I did like the few alterations that were made to the story, most importantly that Jud's wife, Norma not being present. As for violence toward him. It's bloody, but the film is nowhere near as visceral as the original film. Nevertheless, I did like how the movie subvert your expectations with the fake out with Jed with the bed moment. However, the suspense was still a mixed bag. The whole scene of drunken Jed felt like filler, since Louis was able to find the cemetery on his own. While this film did have some scary parts, the exposition dump for the lore of the Micmac burial grounds so draw out that there were very few thrills and chills moments during majority of the movie. There were lots of slow parts with hardly anything interesting going on with a forgettable musical score. It kinda kill me. In the end, it's quite mediocre. It's not even worth watching during graveyard shifts which is a shame. It's better off, buried.",Pet Sematary

He still has dozens of great books awaiting a movie adaptation, so why do we keep getting these second rate remakes of existing adaptations?I loved the 1989 original, it was an incredibly constructed genuinely great film so I was skeptical upon hearing about a remake. As usual, my fears were very justified.Starring the ultra bland Jason Clarke this goes down different roads than both the book and the original, it teases following the source material multiple times then suddenly goes in a different direction. I didn't appreciate this at all, throughout the entire film I was waiting for it give me a reason for it's existence. It never did.John Lithgow is a great actor and can consider me a fan, but for this role he's no Fred Gwynne. Fred Gwynne put in an iconic cult performance, Lithgow I'm sorry to say simply couldn't compare and his accent was terrible.The movie is another example of needless senseless remakes/reboots that simply aren't needed. There are countless tales just begging to get the big screen treatment, so why do we keep getting force fed the same ones? And why are they consistently worse than the last?Pet Sematary brings absolutely nothing of value to the table, it's an inferior adaptation just sparkly thanks to the higher budget.

35,cruise01,A better remake that delivers a bleak dark atmosphere of a haunting tone.,8,7 April 2019,"Pet Sematary (4 out of 5 stars).Pet Sematary is surprisingly a better than expected remake of the 1989 film. I am not sure how close to the Stephen King novel the film is. This supernatural horror film does deliver a creepy eerie direction, keeping true to the plot of the source material with a twisted ending, and it is not as scary but does make you feel unsettled.The plot follows Louis (Jason Clarke) who moved his family; wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), there daughter Ellie (Jete Laurence), and baby son Gage. When they discover they live next to a pet sematary which has an eerie forest. And right next to the highway with semi trucks making surprise appearances as they fly down the street. Rachel begins to have an unsettling feeling about the place as she begins to have thoughts of her traumatic past about her sister. Louis begins to have vivid dreams from sleep walking into the forest or seeing dead patients that he has once worked with. When they lose one of their own children. Louis desperation of taking their dead child to the pet sematary to bring them back. Which everything turns very awry quickly when that sematary brings the dead back to life.The film does twist the characters directions around in this film compared to the original movie. Which does not disappoint. Works even perfectly. Since Louis and his daughter are pretty close. Even when he tries to save her dead cat by taking it to the pet sematary. Which he does not learn his lesson when the cat does not come back the same. Directors Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer did a great job in creating an eerie direction. With Rachel remembering her traumatic past of her sister which she was suffering from some kind of condition. Louis seeing a dead patient appears in his dreams or hallucinations when Louis is walking in the forest towards the pet sematary. That setting is unsettling and creepy. With something evil lurking in the woods which the shadows of what lays in the forest is watching.Jason Clarke did good playing a desperate father that will do whatever it takes to save his children. Amy Seimetz was also good as well. Her character was given a little backstory of a traumatic past that haunts her through the years. John Lithgow plays there neighbor who informs them about the pet sematary.I will say the film is not as scary as I thought it was going to be. It did have a few jump scares. A few unsettling moments. The ending is very unsettling and shocking.Overall, Pet Sematary is a good supernatural horror film. The cast is good. The plot focuses on the emotional connections with the characters. The direction and music score by Christopher Young did a good job in bringing a creepy unsettling tone with the movie.",Pet Sematary
36,zkonedog,Either Doesn't Understand The Source Material Or Doesn't Care To,3,20 April 2019,"I'm usually not angry when a film significantly changes the source material in adapting a novel. The two mediums are just so different that one can't just port into the other. What I can't forgive, however, is when the writers/film-makers don't seem to understand what the novel ""is all about"". That is exactly what happens in this version of ""Pet Sematary""For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the Creed family, who have just moved into rural Maine from Boston for a fresh start out in the country. Husband Louis (Jason Clarke) is a doctor, while wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) takes care of children Ellie (Jete Laurence) and Gage (Hugo & Lucas Lavoie). One night, after the death of family cat Church, neighbor Jud Crandall (John Lithgow) shows Louis a ""special place"" in the woods, and the next day Church is back in Ellie's bedroom. But the cat is also...changed...and not in a good way. When tragedy late strikes the Creed family, Louis is faced with a horrifying decision related to that place beyond the Pet Sematary.What so often gets misunderstood about ""Pet Sematary"" is that it isn't a horror piece. I mean yes, it is scary, but primarily based on the psychological battle that is waged in Louis' internal consciousness. Yes, cemeteries and zombie-like creatures are a bit creepy, but the real knowing horror here is whether or not we'd make the same decision(s) that Louis does.Well, at least that was the thesis of King's novel. Here, however, about halfway through that focus is radically changed, with much more focus (an entire half-hour at least) on post-resurrection dealings. This completely destroys the calculus of the entire piece and changes it into something else entirely. The problem, of course, is that it is still built on the bedrock of King's tale, which means that it just doesn't work.In this film, there is no great internal battle within Louis presented. Events just seem to play out in almost a pre-ordained fashion. Another big misstep is completely excising the angle (from the book) involving Rachel's parents, as well as giving lip-service only to Rachel's deceased sister Zelda, who factors so prominently in the text.Overall, I'm not quite sure what happened here. Either the filmmakers just didn't know how to adapt the story (I could actually forgive this easier, as so much of it takes place within Louis' own head), or they tried to create almost a completely new, more horror-based product. Unfortunately, either way the end product ends up being pretty poor. This project seemed to come out of nowhere, and will likely recede back to those depths just as quickly.",Pet Sematary
37,eddie_baggins,A dreary King adaptation,3,15 July 2019,"As a first port of call it's only fair that I share a cinema sin of mine.I have never actually seen the much talked about 1989 original Pet Sematary that so many have watched as part of the cinematic education, so watching Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer new take on the classic Stephen King tale of evil cats, sinister children and ancient dark magic was done on my behalf with fresh and unknowing eyes.Without being able to make comparisons directly to the original King novel or the late 80's film offering, I can safely say this modern day take on the story of Jason Clarke's kindly Maine Dr. Louis Creed experiencing some extremely odd happenings when his family move into their new rural home is a tame, energy free and curiously scare free affair that feels like it will fail to inspire much enthusiasm from fans of King's work or those seeking a solid horror fix.The groundwork is quite clearly laid down before Kölsch and Widmyer to delve into but this charisma free offering that does nothing outside of the horror trope 101 rule-book fails to captivate us in its creepy exploration of loss and death that could've and should've been a skin crawling experience that burrows deep into the subconscious.It's a kooky tale, right up there with some of the most bonkers of King's career but this version of Pet Sematary feels flat from the get-go and as we are just asked to accept the casual going's about of raised from the dead cats and local children providing ritualistic burials of dead pets, it's hard to get on board with much of what takes place and as the plot line becomes more and more over the top and really rather silly as this wannabe creep fest loses steam well before its final curtain call.Also working against the films generic conception is the fact we never build much of a strong relationship with Creed and his family, that includes rather forgettable performances from its four leads that includes John Lithgow as nice old neighbor Jud, Amy Seimetz as Creeds wife Rachel and Jeté Laurence as their eldest child Ellie and as Pet Sematary relies heavily on us caring for this family and what occurs to them, much of the tension is pulled out from under the film before any of the real nefarious happenings start taking place.In the rushed feeling film its likely you'll walk away from proceedings feeling as though the multitude of feline's that were used to play key film player Church were the films real MVP's, a nice bonus for the film but an indictment on an otherwise completely forgettable experience that offers nothing of note for viewers to remember or truly enjoy.Final Say -A by the numbers affair that neither scares, intrigues or captivates, Pet Sematary is another unfortunate member of the rubbish Stephen King adaptations that are littered throughout cinema history and another 2019 horror letdown.1 ½ roadside birthday party out of 5",Pet Sematary

As with all authors, there are smaller works in the middle of their writing and ""Pet Sematary"" is probably one of them. Even so, this did not prevent three adaptations from being made for the cinema. This film is precisely the third on the list, and the most recent, being a remake of the first, made in 1989. Personally, I found the original film average. It presents several improvements, mainly at a technical level thanks to the most modern technology and methods. But honestly I have some reservations about the script.Being a remake, the script is very similar to the film of the Eighties: again, we have the story of the Creed family again, who moves to the quiet city of Ludlow, Maine, in order to disconnect themselves from the tiring routine of the great City. What they did not expect was that the road in front of their new home had so much truck traffic, which circulated at high speed and without much care. Nor did they expect to find an animal graveyard behind the house, which is presented to them by a friendly neighbor, Jud. The cemetery is a place created by the children of the surroundings, to bury their friends, many of them run over on the road. So far, nothing special. Weeks later, when Louis Creed, a doctor and family patriarch, is unable to save the life of a young man who dies at his hands after an accident, he is warned by the spirit of that same young man that he, as well as his family, are in danger. In fact, behind the house, there is also an ancient sacred place where the Indians buried their dead, but which was abandoned when it became a cursed place. A place where you shouldn't go and where the stony soil hides a cruel force, which Louis will discover over time.The script is very similar to the 1989 film, and there are scenes that were even traced on carbon paper. However, besides this not being exactly original, it also makes the film predictable and boring for those who saw the oldest film. Of course, there are modifications here and there: at least one of the characters in the original film was removed and the script tried to put more emphasis on the character Rachel Creed, developing her traumas and internal conflicts to increase tension. These were positive changes, but on the other hand, the film does not seem to have much feeling: in the 1989 film, I felt that the film was creating an atmosphere of tension and suspense that worked satisfactorily. That was less noticeable here, and it's a shame, because then the film is not able to scare anyone.The cast is decent, but it is not brilliant. The young Jeté Laurence, for me, was the actress who stood out the most, with a remarkable ability to act as an innocent and friendly girl and, quickly, turn into a totally different thing. Jason Clarke seems to me to be well enough, but he was not able to do better than Dale Midkiff did in the Eighties, in the same character. Amy Seimetz initially seemed quite bland, but it improved as her character became more neurotic and traumatized. John Lithgow did a satisfactory job, but no more.At a technical level, the film is reasonably more appealing and interesting than its predecessor of the Eighties. It couldn't be any other way. Cinematography is frankly good, but still within the standard of today's films, with nothing that really surprises us. The visual and special effects are good, and the sets and costumes don't surprise us much. The look of animals and people who come back to life after dying was very well thought out and really leaves no doubt as to the perverse nature of what they become. The CGI effects were used discreetly, as well as the soundtrack, which is not noticeable.",Pet Sematary
39,TheMovieDiorama,Pet Sematary digs up the original and requests to be put down again.,5,7 April 2019,"A remake needs to justify its existence. It needs to be different enough whilst retaining the source material. This remake of the 89' original of the adaptation of King's cult novel immediately starts off as a carbon copy. Hitting each plot point beat for beat. Substituting the supernatural dramatic elements for psychological horror in order to appeal to modern audiences. A few new twists are implemented to keep this remake somewhat fresh, but it still smells like a decomposing corpse. A family move into a new house to which within their property lies a ""Pet Sematary"", sacred ground that allows those who are buried to be brought back to life in a murderous state.Let's address the changes. The execution of its general story was much better in comparison. The direction allows a dark atmosphere to accompany the more expressive performances (yes, that includes Clarke also), making this family a tiny bit more human as opposed to lifeless bodies. There still remains a lack of connection to these characters; but the rectification of certain plot points, such as neighbour Jud's reasoning for burying Church in the first place, made for a consistent narrative flow. There is one discussion regarding death in an attempt to carry that theme throughout, but it's not particularly successful. Due to the better execution, there came a point where I found myself enjoying this more than the original (wasn't difficult...).That is until we get to that pivotal concluding act. Cementing its generic appeal by switching the overall tone from a supernatural horror filled with unimaginative jump scares to a slasher thriller plagued by even more jump scares. The psychological study on humble father of the family Louis almost completely dissipates to make way for frustrating modern traits that are all too common in this day and age. Making something accessible to audiences should not be at the detriment of the film's execution, and that's exactly what happened here. You could say the original film employs the same tactics differently, most likely because it's in the book (I wouldn't know), yet it never removed the atmospheric presence of death. That imperative essence of the afterlife that shrouds the ""sour ground"". Unfortunately, this remake demolishes its creepy environment and falls down the same pitfalls albeit in cinematic fashion.The ending, well, you'll either tolerate it or hate it. It didn't work for me and suspect it differs hugely from the novel, for which I have to lightly applaud as it's probably the only creative reason for this remake's existence. This is a frustrating feature. Despite its better execution and technical elements, the relinquishing of the novel's primary theme to make way for accessibility proves that this story should stay buried. Perhaps this story will never translate well onto the big screen? Or maybe I just don't like the story? Regardless, this remake is neither better or worse.",Pet Sematary
40,Tweetienator,The Dead Should Stay - Dead,6,2 July 2019,"Some reviews are in my opinion too harsh - the remake of Pet Sematary got good acting, a modern production and some changes to the movie from 1989 (I never read the original story by Mr. King, so I don't know which movie is more accurate), which just work fine for me. The only significant difference to the movie from 1989 - in the old one we got a very few almost gory scenes and the old movie looks very 80s style.Anyway, Pet Sematary 2019 is no milestone (like the old movie) but decent popcorn horror - of course, no one out of the teens should be afraid watching both movies. Pet Sematary 2019 = solid entertainment, and I guess is made to please a rather young audience than the stone-cold old and crumpy gorehound ;)",Pet Sematary

The new cast is a lot more appealing. I'll take the always good John Lithgow over the often hammy Fred Gwynne any day of the week. This movie starts off kind of slow but I never looked at my watch.

44,southdavid,"Wendigo to the Cinema, maybe see something else.",5,8 April 2019,"With ""IT"" dragging Stephen King adaptations back into vogue and ""The Dark Tower"" not ruining it too much, this new adaptation of the novel that King considers his scariest appears to come along at the perfect time.Louis (Jason Clarke) moves his family to a small town to try and distance himself from the pressures of an inner city hospital. Soon after their arrival, the family discover that in the woods behind their property there's the Pet Cemetery that the town have used for decades. When their cat is hit on the (distressingly busy) road that borders their property, Louis' neighbour Jud (John Lithgow) shows him an area behind the cemetery where pets interned there come back to life.I can understand why ""Pet Semetary"" has received such mixed reviews. Looking back on it with a few days of objectivity, my feeling is that it's not really much good. It isn't particularly scary, and any moments that are are all connected to the Flashbacks involving Rachel's (Amy Seimetz) sister. So, as a horror film, that's a bit of a mark against it. It has a big, but sensible twist, on the existing plot which I'm going to talk about as it was in the trailer. Instead of losing his young son to the traffic accident it's Louis daughter whose knocked down and he decides to bring her back instead. The change is sensible as his daughter is older and both a much more credible threat towards the end of the film, and makes much closer relationships with, for example, Jud, earlier in the film, that explain the depths he'll go too to help. Overall performances are pretty good, although there are moments of unintentional humour. There's an ""I've made a huge mistake"" moment with Jason Clarke which had much of my screening laughing.It's the ending though, (again, no spoilers) that's is another change from the book, that's perhaps the biggest bone of contention. If you'd have asked me to write my review within half an hour of seeing it, I'd have been much more damning than I am now. My feeling at the time was ""well what was the point then"". . . but with a couple of days of perspective, I have to say that it's said with me - and the horror of what's about to happen has lived longer in my imagination that it might have done on screen.I didn't think it was particularly good or awful, although I'm perhaps more understanding of people who felt the latter.",Pet Sematary

47,jtindahouse,A remake that takes some unfortunate missteps,6,6 April 2019,"'Pet Sematary' (yes I spelt that correctly) is one of my favourite Stephen King horror novels. It's about as close to pure horror as he ever really gets. The original 1989 version of the film was pretty well received and has stood the test of time reasonably well. Now, 30 years later we have a remake. And while it wasn't a complete misfire, I feel it could have been done better in a number of ways.First of all I do not understand how Jason Clarke continues to get leading roles. He is incredibly unlikeable and instantly makes me hate whichever character he is playing. He is in every scene of this movie and it makes for a bleak ride. Secondly, the tempo in this film is wildly uneven. It takes a drastic turn at one point and then just balls everything it has together and throws it at you at once. If you found the cat scary then there might be some better pacing in your eyes, but for me the cat didn't work at all. In the book I can see why it would work, but in the film it was distractingly bad, fake and not the least bit scary.There are one or two good scares to carry the film along. The way the child was done in the latter half of the movie was also handled very well. In fact that was by far the strongest element to the film. I also enjoyed the ending and applaud them for the way they did that. I didn't dislike this film, I just couldn't help feeling it could have been a lot better than it was.",Pet Sematary

The movie's atmosphere is more strange and threatening, a sustained mood it is able to conjure.However, it's never really scary, nor shocking. There is one moment that WOULD be shocking, but those who have seen the original ""Pet Sematary"" know to expect it, so it's kind of toothless here.I still recommend it.",Pet Sematary

Overall it is pretty average.I couldn't really take to Jason Clarke, who plays the father figure. Paid £12 to watch this at the cinema and came away feeling slightly cheated.

52,dfranzen70,"Duck, duck...cat.",6,12 July 2019,"If it weren't for the critical miscasting of Jason Clarke, this would have been a fantastic horror movie. It's definitely an upgrade over the 1989 version (better performances from everyone else), with some interesting plot differences as well. The basic story is that Dr. Louis Creed (Clarke) has moved his family from Boston to rural Maine to begin a new life as a university physician. The Creeds - wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), daughter Ellie, toddler son Gage, and cat Church - slowly take to country livin', although Rachel has her own issues to deal with (repressed memories and such). Rachel and Ellie discover a pet cemetery right in their huge wooded backyard, which new neighbor Jud Crandall (John Lithgow) helpfully educates them about. Things really kick into high gear, though, when Church the cat is found dead by the side of the road...and Jud has an idea to bury him not in the pet cemetery but in the hallowed ground just beyond it. Bad things come of this decision! As I mentioned, there are some differences between this version and the '89 version, but they're either an improvement or not terribly significant. A nonspoiler difference: Lithgow doesn't try a backwoods Maine accent, like Fred Gwynne had, and I think that was a wise decision. It would have invited an unfavorable comparison to Gwynne, surely. The acting in this remake is pretty good, save for Clarke, who's lousy. He's pretty dull, even when Louis is slowly losing his mind. It's as if someone told him to take a subtle approach and he understood that to mean ""show little emotion."" Even his anguished yells sound constipated. Luckily, he has an ace cast surrounding him. Seimetz, who's done a lot of independent, small-budget movies, is flippin' great as Rachel, and Lithgow does a fine job as Jud, but really stealing the entire movie is Jeté Laurence as young Ellie. And let's give a big hand to the five cats who play Church. Bottom line is that this remake stands on its own as a fine horror movie, save for the dreadful lead performance.",Pet Sematary

This is a remake with twists. It is based on the Stephen King novel and the 1989 movie-there was also a sequel in 1992-but things are a little different from the source material. You know, things are switched up, like when something that happened to one character in the original, happens to someone else in the newer version. Jason and Amy play the parents of two small children-a boy and a girl-that decide to move away from the big city life to spend more time with their family. Jete plays their daughter and Hugo is their son. When the family pet cat dies, John, their neighbor, lets them know about the woods surrounding their house and it's special properties. It seems that there is a pet cemetery in the woods by their house that people bury their dead pets-the local children misspell cemetery on the signs posted at the entrance, hence the spelling in the movie title-and then they come back to life, only altered just a smidgen. There is an old Native American Indian folktale involving a Wendigo that has something to do with the resurrections. Well, I'm sure you can guess what happens when an accident causes the death of someone in the family. Jason wants to use the sacred grounds to bring them back to life-never a good idea in these types of movies-to disastrous results. There are some good scares and kudos to the child actors, in particular.

There's virtually nothing there, it's painfully average and half-assed as hell! Something that almost immediately bothered me about it was that everything in the first half felt horribly rushed and wafer thin, in terms of things like character development and motivations and characters that you actually cared about for that matter.. General buildup cohesion and emotional payoff of the story, pathos and all-important deeper dark themes of death grief horror and madness that the first movie integrated into the story and brought to the screen so well..this modern thing here to me doesn't come close to the original picture or book, oh no it does not! You know a lot of these reviews seem to me to consider this a better movie purely based on it being new, and that really makes me a little sad! Ok so I won't say that the acting was bad because it mostly wasn't, with the big exception for me being the distractingly Punch-like Jason Clarke, the guy is a horrible actor who has the emotional presence of a block and his interpretation of the Louis Creed character is just very off putting and not particularly even likeable at all.. In the vastly superior original, when Louis fails to save his little infant son in time from the truck on the pitch perfect sunny day that strangely made the event even more horrific? How he reacted, that scream? That was real mental anguish that you could feel and that hit you hard on display, this film had almost nothing to it in terms of emotional depth and grief you can feel, there wasn't any of the kind of all-consuming, maddening grief that would drive a father to dig up his own dead child to see here, he just did it without a second thought, there was no finesse or subtlety to it, the parents barely seem to grieve at all here, that felt rushed and tossed aside like everything else in order to get to the bloodshed, which by the way really wasn't anything to write home about.. On a positive it does have some solid performances, Jete Laurence was very impressive and she did her job perfectly, being sweet enough that you felt sad for her death and then effectively wicked and hateful enough that you were quite ready to see her die again! Very creepy moment with her and her dad when he's just cleaned her up after seeing her after her resurrection and he's lying next to her in bed and she speaks to him about what's in her head and where she's been after she died. I also thought it was a legit great moment when Rachel is nearly dead and the evil thing that was once her child is taunting her and she turns to her/it and says ""Don't call me mommy, you're not my daughter, Elle's dead..."" I loved that line, it really summed everything up and I could feel it because the damn movie actually slowed down for a moment and let me. Amy Seimetz I liked a lot too, she was really good and sympathetic. I love John Lithgow, he's always been nothing less than a class act as an actor...But he was no Jud Crandall. He did what he could with the role but he just immeasurably paled in comparison to the iconic performance of the late Fred Gwynne, that guy arguably MADE the original movie what it was, even I'll admit that. I didn't like the ending with the silly resurrected whole evil family all together and about to prey on poor little helpless Gage... That was just bonkers to me, what a trite and cheaply nasty way to end the movie. ""Beep beep!"" Nice. So it had potential and wasn't the worst remake that I've ever seen, but I'm not planning on seeing this again anytime soon, it was a weak movie that had no emotional or psychological weight to it, and even on it's own merit, Pet Sematary 2019 is nothing but another average horror remake that will never be as fondly thought of and remembered as the original classic still is thirty years on, and I suspect will in fact be largely forgotten soon enough.

I've never seen the 80's original version of King's film so no comparison there but this version/remake is incredibly well made & full of powerhouse acting performances from literally everyone in the film & the movie is stolen by the great John Lithgow as Jud the old guy who knows alot about the towns sinister history, but truly all giving it their all in the acting department!!!!
Without going into the story & setup let's just say it's an emotional punch & something no parent should go through & the film plays on the fear of Death or what happens after Death? & grief.The atmosphere is thick with a creepiness & unease & the look & cinematography is beautifully creepy & almost gothic-like & looks fantastic.
Jason Clarke is truly incredible as the distraught father who can't except Death & he is fantastic in this role & you feel his raw emotions.
I think this modern day remake has packed in everything & upped it all to a seem more horrifying, super shocking scary & more realistic approach to everything that happens.
The supernatural stuff is all the more disturbing because of the incredibly real performances of loss & grief leading up to it.
I cried at bits & was shocked at bits & was always entertained even when i didn't want to look!!!A great modern Horror film that will definitely become a Cult Classic in time!!!!",Pet Sematary
63,Pairic,A Worthy Addition to The King Canon,9,2 April 2019,"Pet Sematary: A tale of the Old Gods/Spirits which live in the New England Forests, Gods which predated the Amerindians and forced the local Tribes to flee the area. Infused with Pagan imagery from the beginning as a group of children in animal masks parade to the local animal cemetery - Pet Sematary - to bury a deceased dog. The forest is eerily portrayed by day as Autumnal sunshine penetrates the tree canopy but at night the dark forest exudes primeval terror, even before any of the haunted sites are approached. There is another more mundane horror though, that of trucks and cars which threaten to snuff out life at any moment.A Surgeon, Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) and his family have moved to rural Maine and taken a job in a University Hospital. but he soon faces horror as a student struck by a car is brought in with his brains hanging out. The student dies but Louis has visions of him coming back to life and that night, in a dream is led out into the forest by the student, but when he wakes his feet are covered with mud. His wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) has her own traumas and guilt over causing the death of her disabled sister, she now has visions of that event. Eight year old daughter Ellie (Jeté Laurence) meets local man Jud (John Lithgow) in the Pet Sematary, he warns her about dangers in the forest. When Ellies cat is killed by a truck. Jud brings Louis deep into the woods to inter it in an old burial ground from which animals have come back, the cat returns but is different, wilder. When Ellie is killed in a road accident, Louis is of course tempted to bury her in the same spot. No spoilers here, all of this is revealed in the trailers.A tale of revenants and an evil older than time itself which has preyed on the minds of the Creed family since they first moved to the woods. Lithgow is convincing as the knowledgeable, conflicted local who leads the family onto the road to damnation. Jeté Laurence is superb as both the living and dark reanimated Ellie. If the film has flaws then it may be due to having two directors, Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer, as at times it can't seem to decide whether it is a tale of dark comedy or existential terror. But this is a worthy addition to the King Canon with some truly horrific scenes, not for the squeamish. 8.5/10.",Pet Sematary

65,masonfisk,DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN...!,5,15 April 2019,"The remake of the 1989 Stephen King original improves upon its predecessor in some ways but ultimately fails where the originator faltered as well. Not being an especially liked (by me) King novel, the '89 film (which King himself penned the screenplay for) was fairly faithful in telling its tale of a family trying to reorient itself from the hectic life of the big city by settling into a comfortable Maine burg to regroup. When the family cat is killed by a speeding semi (a clumsy use of foreboding if ever there was one), the distraught children are rewarded w/the cat's resurrection (due to an old Indian burial ground which the neighbor shows the new patriarch to use so he doesn't have to face up to telling his children about the realities of life & death) which turns out to be a temporary salve since creatures that are interned & come back, never come back the same. A cloud of doom pervades the entire affair since anyone & everyone is rooting for the father to do the right thing (which he doesn't do) so it becomes a race to see how frustrated the viewer can be as the action escalates to its inevitable conclusion. Having a better cast helps things along a bit (Jason Clarke & John Lithgow essay the father & neighbor this time around) but the obviousness of the story will be evident as the whiskers on poor Church's feline face.",Pet Sematary
66,dworldeater,I'm gonna bury the new Pet Sematary,3,15 September 2019,"Another absolutely unnecessary remake that no one wanted or asked for. It does differ greatly from the original film, while I applaud the efforts to to SOMETHING different from the original and not just re shooting the movie, very little about this movie makes sense or works. While Mary Lambert's 1989 adaptation might come across a little dated and a little campy, being a product of the 80's. The story and characters are much better fleshed out and flows much better than they do in this film. One thing that was interesting was John Lithgow's performance as Judd. I won't compare it to Fred Gwynne's portrayal as they are completely different. Plus John Lithgow is a great actor and does well in most roles. The tone is much darker, but does not mean that this is better. Pet Sematary 2019 relies on jump scares and comes across as much more cliche and standard when compared to other modern horror movie. It tries too hard to scare and surprise audiences at the expense of story and characters, who in this movie I could care less about. Like I stated before, the original film is a little campy, but its a fun movie to watch and is pretty well put together as a whole. This film is a joyless, mundane and incoherent, just a bad movie. Stick to the 89' movie or Steven King's book.",Pet Sematary
67,aidanratesmovies,A Unique and fun remake,9,7 April 2019,"Pet Sematary nails its atmosphere and tone in a perfectly sinister Stephen King esc way, and makes for a very interesting ride. Though the pacing of the film may seem a bit slow at times, when the film picks up its feet, it grabs your heart easily and makes for one of the most enjoyable horror flicks of recent days. Nearly every actor in this film deserves some credit, especially that of John Lithgow as Jutt and Jason Clarke as the father of the family. The daughter also does a pretty great job at her truly horrifying and changing character, and Church the cat once again remains a very prominent horror figure. The music in the film provided for some fabulous suspense, and the overall look captured was unique and quite fitting. In all, Pet Sematary may not be the most original film this year, or the most unpredictable (as the trailers pretty much spoiled everything), but it certainly is an interesting ride, and provides an experience that is nearly unforgettable.
My Rating: 9/10",Pet Sematary
68,peterp-450-298716,Not extreme bad. But was a remake necessary?,5,23 August 2019,"A place to bury our pets and remember them.
It might seem scary, but it's not.
It's perfectly natural.In the distant past, I was an avid reader and devoured books constantly. That has been considerably reduced over the years. But, occasionally I grab a reading book. Generally, that only happens during a well-deserved summer vacation on one or another beach. Stephen King's oeuvre has always enchanted me. This summer vacation I read his book ""Elevation"" in one go. Not that it was high-quality literature, but King is such a wonderful storyteller whose stories grab you and don't let go. That actually applies to most of his books. Of course, there are also film versions of his books that are worth seeing. Personally, ""Christine"" and ""Carrie"" are movies (horror-related) I enjoyed the most (but I can easily name a few more). And the film ""Pet Sematary"" from 1989 can also be counted with films that had a huge impact on me. The only question I first asked myself (and many others too, I guess) was: ""Is it really necessary to release a remake of this film?"".Those who know me a little have read already a few times that I hate remakes, reboots and so on. I admit that cinematographically and when it's about acting, it's most likely to be an improvement compared to the original. But the story, the content, the soul of the film, as it were, will remain the same. And isn't that a bit too easy? But then again, they could also rigorously change the content or storyline. But don't you think this would create a completely different movie? And is there really someone who has the guts to thoroughly change a movie classic? Well, Kelvin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer were brave enough and succeeded in retaining the spirit of the story, despite the drastic plot changes. Only, it didn't impress me as much as the original did.Some elements from the old movie escaped my memory. For example, there's Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine). Either her part wasn't explicitly emphasized in the first film. Or the number of years have begun to take its toll on me. In any case, this was actually the most creepy image used in this remake. The most crucial adjustment they have made is the choice of the victim. In the original, the youngest son Gage (Hugo / Lucas Lavoie) can't avoid a rushing truck. I remember this fact as very shocking to me. That sweet-looking little guy, the kite falling down and the tumbling children's shoe. I can picture it right now. Not that the choice in this remake is less terrible. But it didn't shock me as much as it did in the original film.This choice not only gave the whole thing a different turn, but the scaryness of the film also suffered a major blow. I found the role Gage played in the first film, more creepy than that of Ellie (Jeté Laurence) here. On the other hand, the cat Church looks more ominous and evil, than its alter ego in the original film. And the dead student Victor Pascow (Obssa Ahmed) also came into the picture more explicitly. Broadly speaking, the film remains true to the original idea. The concept of a father's all-embracing love for his child. And the will to cross borders to reverse it all. There are no surprises in that area. Which in turn leads to the initial question: ""Why a remake?"".

69,TheOneThatYouWanted,Cr&p,2,14 September 2020,"The tag line fo this film is ""They don't come back the same"", yeah they must have meant this was going to be a pretty bad remake when comparing it to the first.

70,TheFearmakers,Just Kinda There,5,20 March 2020,"For a movie about a city family moving to the country to ""slow down,"" PET SEMETARY rushes through the first half with choppy editing, often seeming like a prolonged movie trailer...Which only works in that youngest son Gage is all but completely passed over for his older sister, the perfect age for horror movie curiosity... And fans of either the book or the 1989 adaptation know exactly where curiosity gets you...Kudos to the filmmakers for having four stunt cats instead of a single one made of CGI, which has been the trend lately. But family feline Church is more irritable than antagonistic...Meanwhile, dad has his own foreboding ghost while mom's dead sister flashbacks hardly even try surpassing the most nightmarish aspect of the original (even the name Zelda sounds spooky)...What's intentionally the most eerie/creepy aspect are the animal masks worn by young cemetery dwellers...The main problem is that this titular location at night seems part of a movie set, and is hardly important to the film except that John Lithgow's old timer Jud (played by Fred Gwynne before) knows his way around, showing an intense yet fairly dull father/husband Jason Clarke how everything works...So when what happens happens, it's both predictable and, for the most part, pointless and worse of all, not very frightening...Providing the new child menace, played in a Linda Blair EXORCIST fashion by Jeté Laurence, some decent moments that would have fared better in her own vehicle. The pet just gets in the way.",Pet Sematary
71,truemythmedia,Nigh Unwatchable,3,8 August 2019,"As I was watching this film, my mind began to wander. I began to wonder why, when this book had frightened me so much, why was this movie so bloody boring? Take that question a step further: why do so many of Stephen King's great books turn out to be such mediocre movies? Looking at King's IMDb page, I can see that as of today (4/7/2019) he is credited as a writer on 288 different projects, and of those 288, 36 of those projects are currently in development. King is one of the most prolific horror writers of our time, and he has some absolutely wonderful stories, but how many of his horror movies could you say are amazing (horror Stephen King- were not counting dramas like ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Green Mile"")? Four or five? Maybe less.... Kubrick's adaptation of ""The Shining"" is a fantastic film, but King has famously denounced that movie for pillaging his source material and turning it into something its not. DePalma's adaptation of ""Carrie"" is probably the best, and truest adaptation of a Stephen King horror book, but it's still not very scary by modern standards. The same goes for Cronenberg's ""The Dead Zone""; it's good, but not scary. The most recent adaptation of ""It"" was also a lot of fun, but still suffers from lack of scares.I think King's books and stories are hard to adapt because they force the reader to do a lot of internalizing. The reason that Pet Sematary, the novel, was so frightening was because there was an underlying level of dread that Louis himself brings to the novel. When Gage dies in the book, we already know that Louis is going to bury his son in the cemetery. Hell, Louis himself knows he's going to rebury Gage in the cemetery (he picks a kind of burial plot without a cement seal, and hence easier to dig up). Watching Louis internally rationalize with himself, even knowing that the end result will be the same, is ultimately the most terrifying part of the book, and this film does nothing to capture that. Don't see this movie.It's boring and stupid, and that's pretty much all I've got to say about that.",Pet Sematary
72,masonsaul,Disappointing Stephen King adaptation that fails to be scary,4,5 April 2019,"Pet Sematary has good performances from Amy Seimetz, John Lithgow and Jason Clarke as well as strong direction.

73,a_chinn,Passable but unremarkable remake of an King classic,5,26 June 2021,"A mixed bag of a remake of a Stephen King classic (the book, not the 1989 film). The original film version was a mixed bag and this remake is also a mix of good and bad. On the good side, the core story remains intact and is strong, with a big city family relocating to small town Maine with their two young children and soon discover a titular mysterious burial ground. There are a few story changes that play against audience expectations, if you know the original story, which is welcome. This version also does a better job than the original film with more surreal of imagery and a better overall foreboding tone that helps to build atmosphere. The strongest element of this version is John Lithgow as Jud Crandall, the old man who shows the family the ""pet semetery"" early in the film and how it can bring back deceased pet cat. Fred ""Herman Munster"" Gwynne was memorable as Jud in the original film, but he was also kind of ridiculous with his over-the-top thick Maine accent. Lithgow is one of the best actors around when it comes to riding that fine line between sincerity and over-the-top camp, and he does a terrific job here. However, on the downside, the film over relies FAR too much on cheap jump scares rather than generating any real suspect or earned scares. Also, I remember the original film being far more emotionally resonant, where even as a teenager I felt the anguish of the father having to put down his own son. That's the real downfall of the film, that it lacks the emotional depth of the book or original film. Overall, the original film version, not being that great itself, is still superior to this rather lazy and unremarkable horror film. My advice is read the book instead of watching either film.",Pet Sematary
74,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Remake to a King Classic,8,24 October 2019,"I feel like I should lead off stating that I'm a big fan of Stephen King and his works. This film intrigued me as I knew for awhile this film was in development. I saw the trailer for this film quite a few times and I was somewhat upset with the company that cuts it together for revealing something different from the original, which is part of the reason I gave up watching trailers. I was pretty high on this after my first viewing so curious to see where I am after this second one. The synopsis for Dr. Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) and his wife, Rachel (Amy Seimetz), relocate from Boston to rural Maine with their two young children. The couple soon discovers a mysterious burial ground hidden deep in the woods near the new home.The film kicks us off with an overhead view of the new house and land, showing us the aftermath of something. We then are in the car on the way there. Louis, his wife Rachel, their daughter Ellie (Jeté Laurence), son Gage (Hugo and Lucas Lavoie) and cat Church. They go through the city of Ludlow, Maine.Louis goes to work and Rachel stays at home with the children. They hear something outside. Rachel and Ellie see a funeral procession passing by. The noise is the last girl is playing a drum and they are wearing odd animal masks. The two go back inside, but Ellie sneaks out and finds a pet cemetery, but the sign is misspelled. She is drawn toward a barrier, but she falls and is spooked by an old man. He turns out to be Jud (John Lithgow). Rachel finds them and she is upset with her daughter and leery of the man.Later that night, Louis, Rachel and Ellie talk about what she found. It is then that we learn that Rachel has an issues talking about death. We learn that it has to do with her sister, Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine), and a traumatic events with helping her and of her passing away. She thinks that there is an afterlife where Louis doesn't.He is shook up when at work a student, Victor Pascow (Obssa Ahmed), is hit by a car. He dies while he is trying to save him, but is spooked even more when Pascow sits up and gives him a warning. Things get even worse when Judd shows Louis that Church has been hit by a truck. They go up to bury it that night in the pet cemetery, but Judd takes him over the barrier to where the ground has soured according to Pascow.Ellie is told that Church ran away, but she informs them that he came home last night. There isn't something quite right about the cat though. When Louis inquires about what they did, Jud tells him the story of the swamp and the evil entity that according to legend resides there, the Wendigo. Its presence brings even more heartache to the family as it makes events happen that will tear them apart.I heard that this film was one of the darkest adaptations of a King work. It is interesting as I know I read the novel back in high school, not a lot of it stuck with me. Something I will lead of stating in this, I love that they actually bring up the Native American entity, the Wendigo, that caused the land to sour and for the power to bring things back from the dead is explained. That was an aspect I did remember.I do have to agree this is darker than the original as well. If you've read other films where I've seen the original and then the remake, I don't like to compare too much, as I like to look at both of them on an individual basis. With that out of the way, I like the writing for this version a lot. They toned down the Zelda aspect in this one where isn't as creepy and I will admit I didn't like that. What they did do though is flesh out Rachel way more to see the effects that her death caused on her. We do get that in the original, but it feels more real in this one.We have an interesting look at death in this film. The first thing is that the parents are torn on their beliefs and what to do with telling Ellie. Louis seems like an atheist that there's nothing after we die, where Rachel believes in the afterlife. She refuses to talk about death, because of the trauma of what happened to her sister. I find this interesting as I side with Louis here. There is an interesting shift though that happens after the events and with what Louis does. It is also interesting in some of the dark things that are said by Ellie later in the movie.I won't spoil this film at all, but if you saw the trailer or I heard the poster even gives it away, this film has a twist on the event that happens. Seeing it play out was quite tense and now that I've seen it, I'm on-board for the change. How things in the end up going, makes it interesting for sure. I will even shift to talking about the pacing and editing, which I think are both good. For a film that is flirting with two hours, it doesn't feel like it. It really moves along at a good pace. The ending wasn't something I was expecting the first time around. Some podcasts pointed out that they didn't like it, which I won't go that far. There's something that isn't plausible for a character like Ellie to do, even if she has unnatural strength in her condition. They probably should have kept in line with the original and had Louis do it. There's also the issue that the first warning comes before Louis knows about the Pet Cemetery. I think they should have pushed that out until after Louis has heard of it to make more sense.What I think actually makes this film stronger and the feelings of dread are actually from the acting. Clarke is one of my favorite actors and I also feel like his underrated. Nothing against the guy who played in the original, but he isn't as strong. It makes what happens at the point of no return that much more real, because even though I knew what was going to happen, it gave me dread. Seimetz I think was also much better as Rachel. I think part of that is how much more Zelda is incorporated in, so you feel worse for her and the trauma she is still dealing with. Lithgow plays Jud a little less nice and I think it works better. He is another amazing actor, but he doesn't deliver the iconic line as well. I do like that he made the role his own and took it different for sure. Laurence was definitely less annoying than the actress in the original film. She was quite amazing for a child. I was impressed by her, especially for the dark things said in the second half of the film. The boys that played Gage, Lavoies were quite cute and did well. By changing the roles, there isn't a whole lot from them and I'm fine with it. I thought that Ahmed was fine in his role, but the problem is that I do think it is out of order so it almost makes him to blame as much as Jud if you think about it. The rest of the cast rounded out the film very well.Effects for the film were well done. A majority of them were done practically, which if you know me I'm a huge fan of. There is something that happens in the film that really had me cringe. There also seemed to be some CGI. Not a lot of it and for the most part, I couldn't tell if there was, it was pretty seamless. I will say I did notice it in the truck scene. I did like the subtle use on Church and on Ellie though to show us that something happened to them. This was definitely a solid part of the film.Now with that said, even though I really like the original film, I do have to say I think this version is better to me. I like the darker feel to this film, especially with the change from the previous one. The acting is really good, which helps to build the tension and actually makes the emotional aspects of the film that much more intense. The effects were pretty solid, both the practical and the CGI. The score of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it doesn't hurt the film either. I don't think it's great by any stretch, but I think it's good still. I've come down quite a bit since my initial viewing though and now that the hype is gone and I've been able to digest it more.",Pet Sematary

76,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Pet Sematary,6,6 April 2019,"""Sometimes dead is better"". Sure, I'll concur on that one. ""They don't come back the same"". Yup, they sure don't. ""Those woods belong to something else"". Uh, you think? ""Maybe just some crazy folk tale"". Uh, I doubt that.In the actual town of Ludlow, Maine, a doctor, his stay-at-home wife, his feline, and his two kids move into a large house located near a woodsy area. Beyond said woods is an ancient burial ground. Basically anything that's buried there will come back to life and be downright evil. That's the gist of 2019's Pet Sematary, my latest review. In total veracity, I've only seen brief snippets from the 1989 film that came before this second reworking. Therefore with aging eyes and virginal heart, I'm judging the new ""Sematary"" as a biased, stand-alone vehicle.Based on a novel by Stephen King (like you didn't already know), running at 100 minutes, and directed by a couple of unknowns (Dennis Widmyer, Kevin Kolsch), Pet Sematary will only scare the wits out of you if you've never seen a snuff flick before. This is fodder that has a look of something from the Lifetime channel, the CW, or the 27-year-old Syfy network. This is hairball cats, You're Next masks, and crackling wood without the 70's horror graininess. This is hallucinatory imagery and voiceover that comes off as amusing and not completely frightening.With the conventional ""Sematary"", directors Widmyer and Kolsch revel in zoom shots, mild shock value twists, masterful pacing, solid casting (Jason Clarke, Jete Laurence, and John Lithgow are standouts), and neutered gore. Their movie is effectively harmless but it doesn't upset you like other Stephen King adaptations. If I wanna truly be given the creeps I'll see The Mist, The Shining, Misery, or Creepshow instead.

(R)After he and his family move to a small town, Clarke discovers a pet cemetery in the woods behind his house, but then his neighbor (Lithgow) shows him a burial ground even further back that possesses horrifying supernatural potential. Second film adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name, a slight improvement over the 1989 version (though that's not saying much), with slicker production values and decent performances from Lithgow and Laurence. Logic is abandoned pretty early, which isn't normally an issue with horror films, but considering that difficult choices and an exploration of the burden of grief are central to the narrative, not believing the motivations of the characters is problematic. Portents of doom are undermined by ineffective jump scares; ghostly whispers from the dead are sort of silly at first, then just exasperating, ultimately all but forgotten. It seems the only way the filmmakers knew how to do something surprising was to subvert expectations forged by the original adaptation and source material (the close-up on one character's foot takes the cake).

This one is the complete opposite. It takes itself so seriously, it's unintentionally awkward. The forced inclusiveness. The cute cat trying to look menacing. The part where the sister drops out of nowhere, as the if the stunt woman missed a step. The accident showing how bad CGI can be. Even the showdown at the cemetery, both directors look so proud of, felt as if it was straight out of a B movie. The actors do the job, but nothing more. The changes made add nothing to this reimagined version. You may appreciate it at first, like I did, but knowing them takes away the appeal of a second watch. Maybe it's because I've watched the bonus materials, where the crew looked so pleased with themselves, with that new and special approach. But I find the movie hard to sit through rewatching it. If the « indie ness », is what makes the difference, they sure achieved at that. But ruined the whole modernized remake appeal in the process.

While it is the same characters, the story has been tweaked. If you go into it thinking that it is going to be the same you are going to be disappointed. So, just toss that idea. This is different.One of the things that I liked about this is how much darker it is compared to the original. In my opinion, I think the first film was best but this one has not failed to be a decent adaptation. There was a bit more tension and I really liked the trade out between Ellie and Gage. That gave it more dialogue and helped increase the horror taking place within the child.What I didn't care for was how Louis was portrayed. He wasn't coming across right for me and it seemed that he was a bit of a jerk. It also didn't seem as emotional as the first film. There was green screen and CGI stuff that took away from it too but I thought this was a good adaptation.

Jud's motivation for informing Louis about the land's powers is never clear. I'm also not entirely sure that the flashback scenes involving Rachel are as fully developed as they could have been. That subplot had potential to be genuinely chilling, but I don't think it went far enough. Performance-wise; Amy Seimetz does a solid job as her character has a weird back story, which resulted in her having a greater than normal fear of death. She was also wracked with guilt, which resulted in paranoia. John Lithgow played tthe mysterious man living next door well; the enigmatic tone he brought to his character whereby I couldn't tell whether he was going to turn out to be a goody or a baddy is great. Overall, a good horror film with some fun moments and scary set pieces but it just isn't as good as it should have been.",Pet Sematary
83,martimusross,I Hope My Cat Doesn't See This Movie!,8,2 April 2019,"Pet SemetaryThis movie was great from start to finish, it all started so innocuously and then the menace and tension built and built.The husband/father played by Jason Clarke as the normal guy next door brought an intensity and warmth to the screen. This really was a class act, we had him in Aftermath and now this. His on screen presence is so underplayed that you don't notice the skills he applies to the micro-gestures and fleeting emotions he conveys with the eyes.The neighbour, played by John Lithgow was masterfully realised, solid as a rock here and the wife played by Amy Seimetz was the icing on the cake. Whoever cast this movie got it spot on, how a lovely fluffy tabby could scare the b'jesus out of us was brilliant.Within its genre this is nearly perfect on every front, script, cast, plot, music, direction and cinematography.",Pet Sematary
84,MR_Heraclius,Pet Sematary,7,5 February 2020,"A chilling supernatural thriller, Stephen King's Pet Semetary is adapted for the silver screen once again. When the Creed family moves into their new country home they discover a pet cemetery on the property, and unbeknownst to them there's an evil spirit in the woods that has designs on them. Jason Clarke leads the cast and gives a fairly solid performance. And the writers do an interesting job at making this adaption different than the 1989 version and at adding new elements. Also, the cinematography and set designs set a dark and foreboding mood. Yet the scares are rather tame, and the suspense is often undercut. Pet Semetary is creepy and is good for a few scares, but it's not as powerful or frightening as the original (or the book).",Pet Sematary

It was a good Stephen King book, and a fair movie adaptation for it's time.So, I was very excited to see an update of it. To me, this was one of those films that I think really deserved a update. Boy, did they blow it. The ""2"" I gave it was all for John Lithgow. Remove him, and it has a zero from me.I didn't care about the family at all. They were boring. That is not such a crime in the film, but what was...was the Pet Semitary. There was lots to work with there, and none of it happened. No scares, no thrills, no...nothing of what it had the potential of it ever to be.Then, there's the Cat. Big opportunities missed with the Cat that started this all for the family. Even the Cat was boring, when it could have been so much more. Meow here, Meow there...and after being reanimated, it barely did jack. Heck, I've seen Garfield the Cat do more.This was bad all the way around, even when they made the twist with Ellie, which didn't work for me. I didn't even know why it had to change. This was a good chance to re-make a chilling film, and it just fell flat.",Pet Sematary
88,Stephen_A_Abell,Another Reboot Which Is Less Than The Original: Watch The Original.,6,1 August 2021,"Greetings and salutations, and welcome film fans to my review of 2019's Pet Sematary: here are my ratings for the movie.The story gets 1.5 out of 2 - Direction and Pacing a 2.25 out of 4 - The Acting receives a 1 out of 2 - My Enjoyment level earns a 1 out of 2.Pet Sematary, therefore, receives a total of 5.75 out of 10.Whenever a film company decide to make a remake, I suffer a slight anxious nervousness, tinged with a smidgen of hope. I always hope they will enhance the original film, even if they alter the story considerably. Most times, though, what the audiences receive is a below-par rehash. The worst of these being the Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween reboots. The best, and considerably underappreciated, Friday 13th. Pet Sematary falls squarely between these goalposts.The chief let-downs of the movie were the acting. Being a John Lithgow fan, I couldn't wait to see his take on Jud. Sadly, though I've seen Lithgow in a similar character in 3rd Rock, in this picture, he is lacklustre. Jud is supposed to represent the best neighbour; friendly, welcoming, and helpful. And though Jud possesses many of these elements, Lithgow adds torpidity to the proceedings. Whenever he's on-screen, he comes across as dull. Whereas I would have welcomed Fred Gwynne's Jud into the household with open arms but Lithgow's Jud, I'd turn away. Lithgow's Jud is the type of guy who keeps coming around, and because of his age, you don't tell him to bugger off.In fact, there's a lot of depressing acting going around. Jason Clarke as daddy Louis is morose, even when he's in a joyous mood, and that adds to the depression that's growing from the beginning of the movie. It would appear the kids were the only ones who had fun. Even then, it's not the bright and uplifting kind kids should have. Is the whole world depressed?Then there's the Sematary itself. It looks as fake as the actors and actresses performances feel. The neighbourhood Pet Sematary, which is in the woods, looks perfect. However, when our guys hike to the genuine cemetery to bury the cat and then the kid, they climb up a mountainside and look down on the forest. This is the stage set. I swear I spotted some scenery from the original Stark Trek series. For me, though, the biggest disappointment is their journey to the sour ground. They get there without encountering many problems. In the novel, they have to battle the overgrown thicket around the neighbourhood Pet Sematary. Getting to this magical graveyard is going to cost you some blood. I missed this sacrifice; though it's subtle, it adds power and believability to the mythos.I also missed Victor Pascow, who has now been relegated to a throwaway role. Truthfully, this character now plays such a small role that directors Kolsch and Widmyer could have cut him out altogether. I truly believe they only left him in to add more gore and shock to their boring version of King's story. And those special effects are also hit and miss. There's a great shot when we see Pascow's ruined face from the side. You can make out the skull below the ripped flesh, and his eye right eye is on the verge of falling from its socket. His face on the right side looks considerably thinner. Then in the next scene, his eye is okay, and his cheek is puffed out where the effects team have slapped on the makeup. And, it does look slapped on.Then there are the masks. What is up with them? Okay, I know they can look scary, but really(?) When we observe the first pet burial, all the kids in the procession are wearing their animal guises. Personally, if I saw this strange cultist behaviour on my first day at the new house, it would also be our last day. It allows the resurrected to come across as scarier; this is necessary because the kid ain't frightening enough.On the good side, though, the writers did try to make changes to the story to keep viewers of the original interested. However, it wasn't required. The variation in the dead person wasn't sufficient enough to warrant more bums on seats. Even with the alteration, the outcome is pretty much the same; but it isn't because the writers also switch this out. Sadly, they do so predictably and stereotypically. I won't spoil your enjoyment by telling you, though you should see it coming a few minutes before it happens.What this film needed were shades of happiness and sadness. As I stated before, even the happy moments come across as slightly depressive. These pervasive emotions are down to the directors and their slow pace and muted colours. Pet Sematary needed more warmth and less coldness. A change in tempo would have been perfect in this story to show enjoyment and love of life and family. But what we get is the slow plodding of a muchness. Even the camera work is much of a muchness. It's average to the extreme. There are so many scenes where inventive and intriguing angles and plays on light and shadow could have bettered the viewing experience. Sadly, all of these were squandered.All in all, Pet Sematary is a mediocre film that I wouldn't recommend rushing out to watch or even renting. I'd hold off until it becomes a freebie on whatever telly system you're using. Until then, go and get yourself a copy of the original film. Though that in itself has some pitfalls, it's much more entertaining than this rendition.Now leave that dead cat in its grave and come on over to my Absolute Horror list and see where I laid Pet Sematary to rest in my rankings.Take Care & Stay Well; Get Inoculated.",Pet Sematary

More horror and fewer thrillers. End is unexpected but as me it should have end in another way. However movie is watchable. Background score is remarkable. Acting done by Jason Clarke (Louis), Amy Seimetz (Rachel ) and child artist Jete Laurence ( Ellie) is impressive and thus makes a good impact in blood chilling horror story.

It was tough, because the original is really good. But maybe if you cut or shortened some unnecessary long or slow scenes. And/or improve the acting (Dale Midkiff was barely ok, Blaze Berdahl wasn't at all).What you shouldn't do is create almost an exact replica, but randomly cutting important scenes that developed the characters.The Original puts a lot of details explaining the motivations and arcs of the main characters. At the same time, the theme of the movie is always present.30 years later, and with the movie as muse, AND WE STILL MAKE IT WORSE! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?I won't spoil anything. Let's just say that the 1st hour is a BORE FEST, Characters make dumb decisions and express feelings ""out of the sudden"".

94,rockman182,Pet Sematary (2019),6,6 April 2019,"I really have to admit that I got roped in with the trailers for this film. It looked like it would be a more substantial horror update of a sometimes campy first film and it was one of the few remakes that I wanted to see. Also, look at that cute little undead cat. I always told myself that if it came down to evil cats terrorizing us, I'd be the first to die because I'd go and try to pet it. Unfortunately, this film as a disappointment, has a slow build, and completely ruins itself in the last 30 or so minutes.The film is about a family that recently move to a new house that is located near a et cemetery. One day the family cat gets run over by a truck and, the patriarch of thee family (along with the help of a neighbor) bury the cat beyond the pet cemetery. The cat returns to the family although it is not the same cat and is more violent. In the same way the family suffers another tragedy and think about using the unknown power of the place beyond the cemetery to blur the lines of life and death. The film stars Jason Clarke, John Lithgow, and Amy Seimetz.The film has a slow build. Yet, there is barely any real exploration or explanation of the mythos surrounding the power of the burial ground. The characters are not developed very well and are weak. I'm looking at Seimetz's character, wow she just wasn't able to do anything was she? It was nice to see the undead family cat Church, he turned out to be one of the few highlights of a film that just gets tired and questionable as it goes along. The quality of the film drops completely once the accident occurs and it turns into a generic mess of a film.Sometimes dead is better. Sometimes remade is better. In this case, remade is only slightly better and was not worth the effort. Its a poor adaptation that makes me never want to check out the book by Stephen King. There are things going on in this film that add no relevance to the plot. When the credits rolled I was super disappointed by the film and struggled to really pull at things about it that I liked. This effort is a dud with the only really highlight being the awesome evil cat.5.5/10",Pet Sematary

96,RforFilm,"Dead may be better sometimes, but Pet Sematary comes close. It's a somber, but spooky story that I had a good time with",8,11 April 2019,"The afterlife is such a subjective matter for those that are religious and non-religious. For this reason, I rarely like to bring up my own beliefs. I just never found it fair to be the one to say ""my way is the correct way"" when I can't create proof. But it's also fair to say whenever we lose someone, we bring up again whether we'll see them again someday. It's a battle we deal with our entire life, even within our childhood. We all have that memory of having to flush that goldfish down the toilet or bring told from our parents that the lovable dog won't be living much longer.It remains a heavy matter simply because we don't know what happens. Author Stephen King has done a great job of toying his readers with that notion with the constant figures that are ghosts, demons, and monsters and yet filling it with human characters that struggle with their religious beliefs. There has to be a lot of personal experience attached to his stories, and it was no wonder that people were attached to Pet Semetary, a story about bringing back those we've lost. It had a movie in 1989 and we're here to look at the latest retelling of Pet Sematary.Dr. Louis Creed (played by Jason Clarke) has just moved from Boston to Ludlow, Maine with his wife Rachel (played by Amy Seimetz), daughter Ellie (played by Jeté Laurence), and baby son Gabe. Their new home seems like a nice, country-house that would be ideal for a lot of families. They even have a large forest as a backyard. When Ellie goes looking in that forest, she comes across a pet cemetery (though spelled as Sematary) and gets stung. A kind elderly neighbor Jud (played by John Lithgow) brings her back to her family and talk about the place.Jud tells them that the cemetery is a popular town spot for people to bury their pets. This puts Rachel into a tough spot as she doesn't want to bring up the subject of death to her daughter yet, and is experiencing flashbacks to her traumatic childhood. Things become more troubling when the family cat, ""Mr. Church"" gets run over. Jud, not wanting Ellie to experience her first lost, tells Louis about the ""real"" cemetery, past the Pet Sematary. As Louis comes to realize, ""Sometimes, dead is better"".Part of what makes the new Pet Sematary a good movie is what isn't spoiled. I can only say that the changes made were good changes. Does this make it better then the original. I guess it depends on what your looking for. I personally like the original Pet Sematary, but I can't say either is better then the other. It depends on what I wanted, and I prefer scary movies that can build a spooky atmosphere throughout. This does that well as right from the start, as based on how dreary a chunk of it feels, even when nothing scary is happening.Pet Sematary creates a good atmosphere thanks to it's script, which I'll say is better creating claustrophobic tension and character development then the original. Though I was hoping for a little more history on the town and it's use of the cemetery (which I thought the original did better then), it does make sense that for a movie, it's better to keep focus on the main characters.Speaking of which, Jason Clarke does a good job as the conflicted father who understands that his new is nothing like he's ever experienced, but still want to maintain a happy family. He's a guy for good for horror stories, as his eyes really know how define fear. To balance that out, his neighbor John Lithgow does well as the typical wise mentor. Though I'll always love Fred Gwynne, John Lithgow isn't as knowledgeable about the cemetery as before, so he's just as clueless about what will happen as Jason Clarke is. This makes for a spookier experience where there isn't someone that knows what's going to happen. Though I can't give it away why, the actress playing the daughter is amazing at playing...two sides to her character.I'll give this eight Pet Sematary signs out of ten. I can say that even when comparing to the original (I can't do so for the novel as I haven't read it), it's a good horror movie. I will warn though that due to its themes, this is a more somber story then some might expect. If that doesn't bother you, then your in for a good story. Dead is better sometimes, but Pet Sematary is close. Go check it out if you're a Stephen King or horror fan in general,.",Pet Sematary

98,petra_ste,The soil of a mediocre adaptation is stonier,5,27 December 2019,"When horror fans mention their favorite Stephen King novels, most seem to choose ""It"" and ""The Stand"". For me, however, the answers are always ""The Shining"" and ""Pet Sematary"", which I maintain are King's masterpieces - his tightest, most brilliant works.The elephant in the room is the previous 1989 version, which was disappointing with the exception of a fine supporting turn by the late Fred Gwynne as paternal neighbour Jud Crandall.This version has, overall, better direction, production values and performances. Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz as the distressed couple, in particular, are superior to the bland Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby of the original. The exception is John Lithgow, who is nowhere as memorable as Gwynne in the role of Jud, although I blame the script more than the usually reliable Lithgow: the part is very underwritten here.This is one of those ""greatest hits"" adaptations - (nearly) all the main beats from the novel are there (with one major change I won't spoil but, while not disastrous, does weaken the story), but they are rushed and never given enough time to breath.Take the friendship between Louis and Jud, which is one of the emotional lynchpins of the novel; in this film they get *one* measly scene together before something happens to a certain cat, kickstarting the main plotline. The same goes for an agonizing choice the main character has to make; it's the dramatic core of the novel but in the film it takes like three minutes.Although I generally enjoy King, I do find some of his novels (especially the latest ones) bloated and self-indulgent: they could often use some trimming. Not Pet Sematary though; the wretched pacing of this movie really made me appreciate how King took his time in the book to set up the characters and their emotional state.Overall, not terrible but mediocre. Another missed opportunity for a dark but powerful novel.5,5/10",Pet Sematary
99,fernandoschiavi,Even with a strong and courageous ending for betting on something different from the book. Pet Sematary is not the best representation of King's audiovisual potential,6,4 July 2021,"Exactly three decades after the first film adaptation of Stephen King's work, filmmakers Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer bring a new version to the audience. There seem to be two justifications for the comeback: first because there was so much dramatic potential untapped by director Mary Lambert years ago, and also because adapted King works have regained great popularity in recent years, both in theaters with 'It', in streaming with 'Dangerous Game' and also on TV, with series such as Mr. Mercedes and Castle Rock.Pet Sematary, adapted by Jeff Buhler and directed by the duo Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, also promised to fit in the sequence of different adaptations. Everything seemed to fall into place: rising horror directors, a remarkable staff, and a generous budget given the scale of their story. All in all, this adaptation brings some original touches, script changes and a decidedly competent execution.While guaranteeing itself as a technically and dramaturgically better product than the rather problematic original feature, this Cursed Cemetery is, on the other hand, less remarkable due to the lack of risks taken and a pasteurization of its more eschatological aspects, which were reflected in a daring makeup job. And although both productions have the same duration, it is still felt that the new version explores the mythology of the cemetery surroundings with less enthusiasm, without the flashbacks that gave Lambert's adaptation a strong atmosphere of folk horror - here, we only have the inspection of books and newspapers. This exploration of the cemetery's past could have been better presented, including going deeper into past events. The feeling that this was missing is clear.However, the construction of Buhler's script brings a narrative built gradually, the script is concerned with creating and developing bonds between the characters, in addition to presenting their characteristics, beliefs and fears. These are the details used during key moments in the film, both to cause fear and to bond with the audience. Although some points have a poor construction, such as the discussion about life after death, the script plants several elements and then reuses them intelligently, as happens throughout the story with Zelda, a character played by newcomer Alyssa Brooke Levine.Even with little experience, Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer (""Starry Eyes"") have good control over the narrative. The pace of the film is often contemplative so that the audience has time to understand what is going on. In the first tragedy that affects the Creed family, the revelation is made piecemeal. And even though it's a very suggestive sequel, for those unfamiliar with the original material, it has a significant impact. Those who already know are left with a good tension created by detachment from immediacy. However, if the first two acts are guided by an interesting narrative precision, the third has a much faster pace. On the one hand, this could be justified by the urgency of a climax, on the other hand, the script would have elements that would allow for a more careful construction. Because the most significant - and, by the way, very interesting - change is concentrated here compared to the book, the script allowed itself to escape the immediate terror present in the book (and replicated in the 1989 version), but the change in rhythm. The consequences lose some of their impact as there is no time to digest them. A quick sequence of events is exposed, always seeking to maintain the impact the cemetery has on the family.The changes made to the narrative are, in fact, very promising in terms of the possibility of exploring a deeper facet of Louis' actions and their consequences, for both the living and the dead, in a more articulated way - verbally, including. In the accident, there is an exchange of places between two characters, and this exchange, in addition to offering a surprise - minimal, by the way - for those who still have the first adaptation fresh in their memory, allows some later moments to experience tragic situations to the Frankenstein fashion, such as Louis' first dialogue with the dead family member and a dance that takes place shortly thereafter.It cannot be said that this decision was wrong: it yields good opportunities for drama and suspense and resolves some of the story's difficulties in its final stretch. However, by embarking on this different ""trail"", screenwriters Jeff Buhler and Matt Greenberg end up getting carried away and taking the story in a questionable, absurd direction that dilutes King's impact and ""the moral of the story"". Both the book and the 1989 movie, despite their problems, are about people who suffer and get hurt because they can't face their feelings about death, the greatest of all human fears. The 2019 movie even starts out being about that, but at some point it loses that essence and replaces it with jump scares, script holes - at one point, Ellie seems to ""tele transport"" from one location to another - and mere scenes of killing sprees that don't even come close to the gothic vibe and existential terror of the book.The entire technical aspect is well developed, such as art direction and soundtrack. However, the new choices turn Ellie into a zombie-girl or possessed-girl, who acts hysterically, in exaggerated aggression, putting aside the psychological horror of the original. Remember that in the 1989 film, Gage is rarely seen in the final sequence, but his presence is perceived by his voice or by toys thrown around the house. Rachel's fight with her daughter is as unconvincing as the old Jud's with Gage, although the woman was only concerned with protecting her young son.Another controversial change involves Rachel's disturbance with her sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine). Meningitis in the spine is not explained, but the physical change that made it crooked and forced young Rachel to feed her is similar, even though the remake features a food transport elevator, without justifying how the patient moved to it under the conditions presented. But the idea that the remake has used it all the time is interesting, with the information that the place where they are living would be awakening those bad memories.The script effectively exposes what goes on inside the characters, especially the mother Rachel Creed, brought to life by the sensitive interpretation of Amy Seimetz. His fear of death is well characterized, and this moment ends up having great importance in the plot, as it did in the book. It is questionable, however, the script's tendency to use flashbacks about her sister Zelda's death as a source of jump scares, that ordinary horror movie scare created by a sudden noise in the soundtrack. Seimetz turns out to be the highlight of a good cast that delivers solid performances: Clarke is effective as Louis, although his character doesn't arouse as much empathy as it should; Lithgow is very good as Jud, exposing information for the plot and characterizing well the old man's loneliness and his friendship with Ellie Creed; and newcomer Jeté Laurence handles the responsibility of playing Ellie herself in a difficult role.Still, there is very little that can be called new, and almost everything remains true to what was seen in 1989, making the new adaptation practically obsolete for those who already know its synopsis. In addition to the scenes mentioned above, only the ending is changed, and if explored for a longer time, it could highlight this version scripted by Buhler. However, when it reaches such an interesting point, the feature quickly comes to an end, and even a great cover of the iconic song Pet Sematary by glam punk band Starcrawler doesn't fight the feeling - in fact, it reinforces - that there's no end to it all. Of just re-presenting history to a new generation.Although raw from a script treatment point of view, Kölsch and Widmyer's conduct oozes competence and serves as a calling card for future projects. Investing in practical effects and simple mise-en-scène tricks, the two are well defending their preference - or aspiration - for a more ""analog"" style of horror, without relying on too much computing or camera gimmicks to create their most impactful moments. Visual. In fact, the main weapon used by the duo is the accentuated sound design, loaded with squeaks and twitches of furniture and other old structures - a tool used successfully on the first occasion involving a freight elevator. On the other hand, the gore factor is more shy, and sometimes violence is evoked completely out of frame.In essence, ""Pet Sematary"" is a horror film that oscillates between good moments loaded by drama and badly executed horror sequences. For a genre film, it's hardly close to what it would have to offer. Unfortunately, it is impossible to disregard the weight that the execution of some scenes carries. And the consequence of this is the feeling of oblivion, even with a strong and courageous ending for betting on something different from the book. Pet Sematary is not the best representation of King's audiovisual potential. Even 'It', which relies more on humor, combines terrible themes with gruesome aesthetics and scenes of tension. The new film doesn't have any of that, however, introducing the original plot in a lazy, inconsistent and therefore easily forgettable production.",Pet Sematary

The little girl, Jeté Laurence, gets smashed by the tanker trailer of a semi and her body is unscathed. She only has a lazy eye after she returns from the grave. Come'on guys? I know she is a sweet adorable little girl, but you are making a horror film for sake. It's been 46 years since we made little girls disfigured and frightening with Linda Blair as Regan in the Exorcist, why hold back in 2019? Even Lithgow did not escape a bloody end.I thought the makeup work on John Lithgow was well done because I barely recognized him. I was concern his goofy mannerisms would ruin the film but he did a good job acting.

102,markthomassintek,Bland,5,6 April 2019,"REVIEW - PET SEMETARYit's spelt wrong is one of the lines of the film and yes it is, but why start a review in the way I have?Hollywood seems to be going through a phase of reboots, revamps and remakes, it's either these or superheros and unfortunately nothing much original or new so we are being offered these and various sequels, as such a lot of films just merge into one another. With Pet Semetry the above line is actually the only thing I found interesting about this remake of the classic Stephen King film.I remember watching the original and of course reading the book, so this as with Dunno could never replace the original for me and I can't say how someone new to this film would find it because it is in my personal opinion bland.Rating 5 out of 10",Pet Sematary

John Lithgow keeps his promise yet again and is magnificent. Such an actor. I only recognize him from his voice. A new family moves into the suburbs right next to the woods. Their backyard abuts the Pet Sematary land. When the only child's beloved cat dies Dad and farmer Lithgow bury him in the PET SEMATARY instead of the Pet Sematary. Kitty comes back to life but as a monster version of the beloved pet, as all who are buried there do. When the only child dies the same series of events replay to devastating effect.",Pet Sematary

When Churchill, the pet cat is killed on the road, a neighbour (John Lithgow) shows the doctor an old Native American burial ground where the cat is revived. However, Churchill returns as a rather disturbed souless creature. Then the family's daughter (Jete Lawrence) is killed on the road...A remake better than the original. Again of course it is adapted from Stephen King's novel, his own personal favourite among his extensive body of work. It is fairly well acted and superior to the dreadful cult 1989 film that maintains one thing the original had, a very unsettling atmosphere. This time the undead child is switched from the son to the daughter.",Pet Sematary
105,kjproulx,A Rock-Solid Horror Remake,8,5 April 2019,"It's not very often that a remake comes around and impresses fans of the original film, as well as create new fans alike, so when that happens, I believe it deserves to be celebrated. While I enjoyed the original Pet Sematary, it was almost as if the filmmakers hadn't quite gotten the right grasp in terms of everything surrounding the story itself. Personally, I found the original film lacking in performances, as well as the editing choices. The original film doesn't hold up very well, at least in my opinion, so I can see why they decided to give it a remake. Surprisingly, this 2019 version of Pet Seminary is actually an improvement on a movie I quite enjoyed already, so I can't deny for a second that I had a good time with this one. Let's dive in.After a family moves into a new home near the woods, Ellie (the young daughter) finds her way down a path behind their house, which leads to a strange cemetery. Meeting an elderly man in Jud, he befriends her and her parents, but that may not be for the best. Just beyond this cemetery, which goes by the name Pet Sematary, lies a burial ground, where things can be brought back from the dead. Once Louis (the father) finds the family cat has died, he decides to make this the burial spot for him. This is all part of the first act of the film, so this isn't giving anything away for those who are unfamiliar with the story. From here, the film just becomes creepier and creepier, making for a great horror flick.Now, where I fear this movie won't win over those who have seen the original and didn't like it, is with the fact that it very similarly tells the same story. There are great changes to the film that ultimately make it a better overall film, but most of the story beats are present and if you weren't a fan the first time, I doubt this one will win you over. With that said, this is a chilling, creepy, and satisfying story from beginning to end, that I feel many horror fans will get a kick out of. Although the fact that it didn't feel all that original was a detriment for me, it's so well-made that I was able to ignore that aspect.Most great horror films are remembered for their scares and eerie atmospheres and while this movie takes slightly longer than most horror films to hit its stride in that regard, it definitely goes all out by the third act. From the sound design to the cinematography throughout, everything about this movie felt meticulously crafted. On top of that, there are terrific performances by the entire cast. Jason Clarke is great as always and Amy Seimetz (who plays his wife in the film) surely has a bright future ahead of her. Like all movies though, there's usually one performance that stands out as the best and I feel as though young Jeté Laurence, who has only been in the game for a few years now, stole the show in a big way.In the end, this is a remake that deserved to be made for many reasons. The cheesiness of the original doesn't hold up and the performances sort of ruin it for me as well. The 2019 version of Pet Seminary doesn't do a lot new to call this a masterpiece in comparison, but it's definitely a solid improvement. I really like the story behind this movie and the horror elements fantastic as well. To fans of the horror genre or fans of the original film, I recommend checking this one out.",Pet Sematary
106,Neptune165,The ending was dumb to be honest,3,1 July 2019,"Its not going to work. Gage dying ripped my heart out Because it was more believable. Ellie old enough to know not to play in the street!! I am terribly disappointed. Not only did they ruin the movie,they dismantled the original storyline and lore boundaries in a bad way. The characters were awful, the end was complete nonsense My main takeaway from the movie: not a anyone of the characters knows how to brush hair. The best description I could give the movie was that it felt desaturated. All the things that made you feel in the book were drained out of it and it was left with framework that then got rebuilt as a standard horror movie. they ditched all the best character interpretations and relationship in favor of jump scares.

This movie tries to approach some things differently, and it's ok. The problem is that it's a little confused about what it's trying to be. It's not as subtle as it should have been and the trailer spoils a lot. The additional storylines make little sense, while the father-daughter relationship is interesting.And this is pretty much the movie, without diving into spoilers I can say that it has about 20 minutes of actually creepy and disturbing scenes between the father and the daughter. Other than that, there isn't much interesting going on. They could've improved it by making it slower and less in-your-face, but they didn't.

Yet a worn out characterization and paucity of answers left me disgruntled.Let me start off by corroborating the fact that I haven't read the novel. My scrutiny is solely dependent upon this particular execution, not the story itself.
Coming back at it, I feel it's decent enough.
A comparatively swell experience, especially keeping in mind au courant track record Hollywood have had in Horror.An enticing plot, but not adequately enough exploration surrounding the core concept left me craving for more answers in the end.
It does a good job terrifying you at times, however a repetitive pattern in setting up those scares readily becomes monotonous in nature.
The screenplay takes a considerable amount of time to build its bases. Eventually getting better as the film progresses; finally reaching full potential in the end.Performances are praiseworthy, perhaps the most engaging aspect in here.
All the actors being solid at their roles, but the absence of necessary depth subdued their efficacy in the long run.
Cinematography & the Soundscore both being on par with my usual expectency.
Sombre, melancholy tones with Misty, faded vibes surely helps to create a certain mood.In a brief conclusion, I prefer it for all the right boxes it ticked. At the same time, I really feel a more expounded narration would have sufficed.",Pet Sematary
115,meydiana-65242,Pet Sematary: Yet another remake that should never have happened,1,31 October 2020,"Most Stephen King adaptations have been fantastic and there are so very very many of them. He still has dozens of great books awaiting a movie adaptation, so why do we keep getting these second rate remakes of existing adaptations?I loved the 1989 original, it was an incredibly constructed genuinely great film so I was skeptical upon hearing about a remake. As usual, my fears were very justified.Starring the ultra bland Jason Clarke this goes down different roads than both the book and the original, it teases following the source material multiple times then suddenly goes in a different direction. I didn't appreciate this at all, throughout the entire film I was waiting for it give me a reason for it's existence. It never did.John Lithgow is a great actor and can consider me a fan, but for this role he's no Fred Gwynne. Fred Gwynne put in an iconic cult performance, Lithgow I'm sorry to say simply couldn't compare and his accent was terrible.The movie is another example of needless senseless remakes/reboots that simply aren't needed. There are countless tales just begging to get the big screen treatment, so why do we keep getting force fed the same ones? And why are they consistently worse than the last?Pet Sematary brings absolutely nothing of value to the table, it's an inferior adaptation just sparkly thanks to the higher budget.

117,MrDHWong,An effective modern adaptation of Stephen King's famous novel that is mostly superior to the 1989 film,7,4 April 2019,"Pet Sematary is a horror film based on the Stephen King story of the same name. Starring Jason Clarke and John Lithgow, it is an effective modern adaptation of King's famous novel that is mostly superior to the 1989 film.Doctor Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) moves from Boston to Ludlow, Maine with his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) and two children Ellie and Gage to a secluded wood side home. Upon settling in, the family discover a small Pet Cemetery (misspelled as ""Sematary"") on their property after noticing a parade of young children in animal masks travelling there. After the family cat Church is hit by a truck, Louis is told by his neighbour Jud (John Lithgow) to bury Church's body in the ""Pet Sematary"" and the following morning, turns up alive, albeit, angrier and more dirty.Suspenseful and creepy, Pet Sematary is a worthy adaptation of Stephen King's novel and is considerably better made than the dated original, which is not saying too much. Despite some cheap jump scares, there are still some solid moments of fear and foreboding horror emanating through the story thanks in part to some of the liberties taken with the source material. The acting can also be considered an improvement, especially from Jason Clarke as Louis and Jeté Laurence as his daughter Ellie. Along with the 2017 remake of IT, this is one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations to date.I rate it 7/10",Pet Sematary
118,CANpatbuck3664,A Decent Effort That Doesn't Fully Translate,6,12 April 2019,"One of the first aspects that caught my eye about Pet Sematary was how they did a good job wringing creepy atmosphere out of the country setting. The house the Creed family moves to is beautiful but something feels creepy about it right off the bat. The actual cemetary, the burial ground and the forest ooze sickness and regret and it helps put you in the movie. The work with the set design, the cinematography and the effects team put in a good effort.The cast of Pet Sematary isn't full of huge names but it's largely populated by talented actors. Jason Clarke is a take it or leave it type of leading man, I like him in this but admittedly he needs the right material. He does a decent job as a tortured father who can't let go. Jete Laurence does a good job playing a scary little kid, she's actually more effective as a villain and less believable as the unaffected and innocent Ellie. Amy Seimetz is good in a pretty thankless part, conversely to the actress playing her daughter, I thought she did a better job in the early going and came off as more campy after the horror really started. The actor in the cast I was really excited to see was John Lithgow, he's a wonderful character actor and his range is impressive (check him out in How I Met Your Mother or the underrated Trial and Error). I also enjoyed him here but I was a little disappointed, his part was limited and I wish they gave him more to do.Getting to what I didn't like about Pet Sematary, the first thing is that the movie is SLOW. I get that the point is to organically set up scares but despite a fairly quick run time (roughly an hour and 40 minutes), Pet Sematary feels long. The slowest scenes are the bits before the family members get reanimated and by the time we hit the halfway point, I was wondering if we were running out of time. It also hits the big moment and then after that, it feels like the movie is rushing to wrap up (which undercuts the tension). The next is that the movie lacks any kind of self awareness, I really liked the book but this movie left me questioning whether I'm remembering it too fondly. The theme of unbearable grief is relatable and gives the book some dramatic moments but the idea of the force that makes this possible is pretty half baked and that the reanimated family members could outwit and overpower the other members strains plausibility. The new ending is a bold choice but it only reinforces this point. Lastly, there were some big unintentionally funny moments where the theatre that I saw this in burst out laughing and I understood why.Pet Sematary isn't terribly scary but also manages to skirt being an outright bust. The acting is pretty good, the movie is filled with creepy imagery and atmosphere and they capture the inherent pain of the Creed family. On the other end is the slack pacing, the unintentionally funny moments and how awkward some of the plot points from the book are. I left the theatre shrugging my shoulders, its not a bad adaptation, my thought on the drive back was that maybe this is just one of those Stephen King stories that doesn't translate well to film. I saw this with a friend and she was thought it was really creepy so maybe I'm in the minority. If you're a King fan, I would still recommend IT or even Gerald's Game ahead of Pet Sematary. It's good enough to check out but I think you could wait to rent it or get it on your preferred streaming service.",Pet Sematary
119,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,17 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ,..Thirty years after the original ""Pet Sematary"", comes this 2019 remake based on the classic Stephen King novel. And I have to admit, it is a lot better than I expected it to be. Bolstered by solid performances by actors invested into their roles and 2nd-to-none cinematography, this is a film to see and enjoy.When the Creeds (a doctor, his wife and two kids) move to a country home in Ludlow, Maine, their dreams of a peaceful, quiet life turn into the worst possible nightmare ever. It all starts when their daughter, Ellie, discovers a pet cemetery down a path behind their house. Their neighbor, Jud Crandall, seems friendly enough, but has a bit of a hidden side to him. After their cat, Church, dies, Jud shows Louis Creed a sacred burial ground beyond the pet cemetery where they bury the cat - and the very next day, Church is alive and well ... and with a very bad disposition. But when their child dies, Louis plans to do the unthinkable.This is a very well made and produced film. I loved the camera work, overtones and backdrops. You really felt like a part of the movie. All the actors involved are truly invested and do their best to provide a good performance. The pacing is seamless and forward moving. Even having seen the original movie and having read the novel, I full well knew what was going to happen ... or should happen, and yet I was completely immersed into the story. They alter the story in parts, but it doesn't ruin the overall feel or effect. This is good moving making and a worthy entry into the catalog of Stephen King adaptations.Even so, I did enjoy the first movie better than this offering. It is a recommend though. I would watch this one again, and in fact, have already seen it twice. I liked it better the 2nd time. If you aren't too critical in your evaluation of this remake when standing it up next to the first film, then I think you'd enjoy it.",Pet Sematary
120,statuskuo,A Dud That Should Be Buried,2,24 August 2020,"I respect the movie makers to attempt to make this their own. But what it ends up doing is turning it into something of a hybrid slasher to zombie flick. Or perhaps it was always a zombie flick.
The problem stems from very bland characters. Jason Clarke, who is normally a fascinating guy, seems so bored from the material. His dead expression doesn't translate as ""burned-out big city doctor"" but just burned out (perhaps from his recent slew of projects he's involved in). Also, none of it was scary. To be fair. The original adaption wasn't that scary either. This version felt even less about the deep loss and more about how to connect the dots. For instance, the procession of children who hold a ritual burial for a deceased pet. Okay, where did that ever go. And what happened to those kids? Did this line of plot ever come back? No. Only to be creepy...ish. As a friend once said ""seemed filmed just for the trailer.""The source material has always had a major flaw. In a way, we sort of know that death will come and it will involve resurrection. Okay...so? We've seen this already. What I feel the story lacks is a LOT of character building. Since the most interesting character background is actually the mom Rachel (Amy Seimetz) who isn't remotely absorbing everything that is actually happening. Or it happens too late. To be fair, Denise Crosby wasn't exactly hitting it out of the park either. But we do get to see a relationship with the sister whom she is haunted by.And this review obviously wouldn't be complete without comparing Juds. There is a presence around Fred Gwynne that NO ONE will ever touch. And, in a lot of ways, that is probably the most egregious reason as to why this remake should not have been done. I believe the makers of this didn't consider the absolute iconic nature of Gwynne's performance. While hammy and sometimes ridiculous Maine accent, he sold it. For some reason John Lithgow seemed lethargic and at some points...confused. He embeds himself in the family in a very unnatural way. And there is nothing particularly interesting about him that makes Ellie (Jete Laurence) find fascinating. Other than they needed to get that out of the way fast. Lithgow's gruff approach doesn't add the warmth that Gwynne provided.
FInally, when all Hell breaks loose in the movie, I just didn't feel it was worth the time. Look, it's damn near impossible to scare people anymore. The ""secret"" change that is involved here isn't that mind blowing as it thinks it should be. It just makes you feel the gimmick more. The 1989 movie wasn't great shakes, but at least it got really tragic fast. And you felt the loss more. Emoting to get the audience to emote DOES NOT WORK. And definitely doesn't work when one of your better assets becomes the one thing they have to destroy. Ugh.It's just a movie that really makes you wonder why it was even made.",Pet Sematary

This doesn't add anything to the 1989 version apart from superior special effects courtesy of advances in CGI.Only minor changes to the story. A family move from the city to the outskirts of a New England village where there's a spooky outcrop in the woods beyond what the local kids have mislabelled as the ""Pet Sematary"". Trucks thundering past their new house on Day One signal with no subtlety disasters that are to come.There are more scares before the ""resurrection shuffle"" than after. The second Second Coming is totally OTT and seems to be sourced from the CHUCKY movies rather than Stephen King's original novel. I'm guessing Mr King was inspired by the 1902 story THE MONKEY's PAW (by W.W.Jacobs) which was somehow more spooky because they didn't open the door when 'he' came back. Not enough for today's grossed-out audience, of course.John Lithgow is clearly slumming here as the old-timer neighbour who sets the drama in motion but he's the best thing in this.

Is it scary? In all honesty, no. It definitely does a good job of keeping suspense and keeping you fished in, but in terms of feeling ""scared"" at any point, I'd have to say no.So is the film good? Well I'll have to refer back to the title for this. The first 45 mins or so is really good. The plot kept me fished in and the story was plodding through very nicely. My only early concerns was that the wife and daughter were really annoying me, like my god they had the charisma of a brick wall. Nothing going on with them and just unlikeable.Then the rest of the film just gets worse and worse. The explanations for things happening become either too vaguely explained or not explained at all. The characters become more and more unlikeable and just generally the film started to lose my interest. My biggest gripe of all was the ending. What's the point of it???? I won't explain the ending, but the ending is so bad. Nothing gets solved, nothing gets explained and there's no end goal and for an ENDING, that's poor.
But yeah, the final hour or so of the film is just a car crash, scenes just seem like they are being thrown in with no real reason and just overall it's just bad. There's no other way of saying it without being blunt.Overall, would I recommend this? Probably not. I think a 5/10 is fair as I'd rate the first half 7/10 and the second half 3/10.

No goose bumps! Why? Well... it's not crystal clear. Probably because of a slightly uninspiring realization and a confusing Jud's character. Indeed, he has been living since his birth on a cursed and soiled land, but he does not seem so much disturbed, while the Creed family feels crippling disturbances from the very first days following their arrival. Jud is fully aware of the flight of the Indians from this place, yet he inexplicably remains in Ludlow. As a synthesis: worth a try. At least, read the book. I remember I loved it!",Pet Sematary

And, to my surprise, the next day I checked the mail to see that I won a free ticket to see it again. Then, someone gifted me an iTunes copy of the movie. I've had multiple opportunities to see it, and every single time I tried so hard to like it.But I couldn't. In fact, I despised it. I hated this movie with a red-hot passion reserved for only the worst films in cinematic history.As a preface, I'll say that I'm a lifelong Stephen King fan. I've read Pet Sematary multiple times, and I always go back to the book with a certain fondness. The original film, while not totally capturing the essence of the novel, is still an effective horror movie that can shock and horrify without relying on jump scares and bad CGI to get the point across (remember Zelda? She STILL haunts me to this day and that was simple, hand crafted special effect work). It left a lasting image and experience in my mind that the book couldn't quite give me and, in that way, the film complemented the book.On the onset, this film looked like it was going to be really good. The trailers made it look like it would offer the story that scared us all silly for years, but with a few tweaks to make it a little more faithful to the novel in some ways, and a different experience in others. What we got was... well, different, all right. And in all the worst ways.There are jump scares in this movie. And yes, they made me jump. That doesn't constitute good horror.
There are special effects in this movie. And yes, some of them made me uneasy. That doesn't constitute good horror.The story changes are absolutely unnecessary and offer nothing of value to the plot, the acting is bland and the things that were retained from either King's original story or the novel are so diluted that they could just as easily pass as a parody as they could a remake of a classic horror film.The storylines felt forced (especially Zelda, who, if you've seen the original movie, you've likely been living in fear of ever since). The one area where this movie could very easily have scared me to the point of needing therapy... and they managed to screw that up!There's an issue in horror today. So many people are filmmakers, but they don't have a grasp on horror. It doesn't matter whether you like horror or not, or whether you want to make a horror film or not... if you don't have it, you don't have it. The team behind this movie don't have it, and they essentially left behind a product worse than any of my lowest expectations, offering nothing of substance or even casual enjoyability.This is one movie that I couldn't ever be paid to sit through again. Trash from start to finish.Except the cat. The cat is adorable.",Pet Sematary
127,sweidman-28016,Average Horror Movie,6,11 April 2019,"Pet Sematary (2019) Review:In Pet Sematary, Dr. Louis Creed and his wife, Rachel, relocate from Boston to rural Maine with their two young children. The couple soon discover a mysterious burial ground hidden deep in the woods near their new home. Things soon turn sinister and dark. I was excited for this since I love Stephen King and the recent remakes have been good. The trailer looked creepy and I was ready. The original movie is interesting but corny so I thought this was a necessary remake. Surprisingly this movie wasn't as scary as the trailer alone and kind of boring. So the plot was basically the same, just as I suspected, but with a few twists in there. The obvious one is even in the trailer showing that the girl, Ellie, dies instead of the boy, Gage. Also the trailer is the whole movie really. There were some twists and stuff added that I liked however. The development on the past life of Rachael was much more interesting. And with Amy Seimetz portraying that role, she did very well bringing a connection to the character. For me she was the star of the movie. Jason Clarke as Louis was fine, it's just that his character was so bland in this and I just wanted him to leave. John Lithgow was good as always and I thought he did a fine job. Jeté Laurence as Ellie was creepy but slightly annoying. But back to the plot there were some changes that I liked and some I didn't. I did enjoy seeing Ellie dying instead of Gage because we could get a stronger performance. There's a character that is supposed to play a big role in this, Victor Pascow, but he was only in there for a really short period of time. I felt if he was in there longer like he's supposed to be it would've added a little. A wendigo is mentioned in the movie, also in the trailer, but it really wasn't brought up ever again. I thought there would be something big with it but I guess not. Those were the changes I feel were major and should've been left or changed. I haven't read the book or anything so I'm basing it off my knowledge of the original movie. The first act of the movie set up so much trying to explain the Pet Sematary which I get for those who haven't seen the original but it's like they were talking down on us. Everyone knows what the Pet Sematary is and does so much of that time could've been used for other things. The movie didn't feel scary to me, though I still have yet to find a movie that actually scares me. There were a few jump scares but nothing much else. There's an intense part in the middle feeling like it's going to set up for something creepy but that's about as scary as it gets. It was gory either. The climax felt rushed to me. After the whole Ellie part everything felt rushed to get it done. I wanted either a more exciting climax or it to just end really. The editing at the beginning was weird to me but got better later. I think they should've fixed it. That's it for technical aspects. So I didn't exactly hate this movie. I actually didn't mind it much at first after it was done. It's just the more I think about it I just wanted more from it. I'll probably watch it again in the future but it was just ok. If you want a horror movie you could watch this but I would definitely recommend seeing Us over this.My Grade: C+",Pet Sematary

The tone is much more serious and has more emotional impact but suffers because it is much more boring and too depressing. There is nothing really memorable about this version. It's like so many other unimaginative remakes like Total Recall (2012), Robocop (2014) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010). There are whole sections of the film where nothing happens, just small amounts of character development. I'll give them some credit, the characters are relatable, but they are dull!

But the last 40 minutes veers away from the book, and, for me, get a little more silly-creepy, and then ends with sort of a stupid-creepy vibe.

The acting was normal, the horror element was zero and creepiness was average. The movie was not properly connecting and fails to indulge the audience. Also, the writer changed a lot of things in the story and it just made story bad and less effective.

139,mwilson1976,Sometimes Dead is Better,6,7 April 2019,"A dark, oppressive and eerie adaptation of Stephen Kings 1983 novel, that is brave enough to make wholesale changes to the source material but over does it with too many unnecessary jump scares.

When the daughter witnesses a funeral procession of local kids in eerie animal masks, they discover a mysterious graveyard hidden deep in the woods near their new home. Jason Clarke is the dad who won't let the dead stay dead when tragedy strikes, and Amy Seimetz is his wife who is spooked by visions of her dead sister Zelda, who suffered from spinal meningitis and fell to her death in a dumb waiter. John Lithgow plays Jud Crandall who knows all the secrets of the Pet Sematary.

Jeté Laurence as Ellie Creed, returns from the dead possessed by the spirit of a Wendigo, she transforms herself into Jud's dead wife and goes on a killing spree, as well as vandalising the house while practicing her ballet.

140,room102,Decent remake - recommended,6,4 April 2019,"Just watched it on premiere day. Pretty good remake/adaptation. It's similar to the original movie - and hard not to think of the original while watching this - but it has some small changes here and there to make it slightly more surprising even to those of us who are familiar with the original. The kid (Jete Laurence) is very good in her role. John Lithgow is always good, although here he has a tough competition with Fred Gwynne who was excellent as Jud in the original movie. Jason Clarke (whom I'm not a fan of) is ok in his role. The wife is pretty much a side character and doesn't leave you with anything memorable. And Victor Pascow, who was a very memorable character in the original (which says something for such a minor part) is very forgettable in the remake.Christopher Young is always great. His score is servicable for the film but not something very memorable. It's strange that the most prominent part is the kids' drum section heard in the trailer.I think this movie is slightly more psychological and deals a bit more with death and loss of a loved one. Or perhaps it's just because I see this version as a 30 years older guy. I need to rewatch the original to judge.All in all, this is a decent remake. Each version has its own advantages and I guess a mix of the two could create a movie better than both.5.5/10 Recommended",Pet Sematary
141,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Pet Sematary"" (2019)",8,9 April 2019,"""Pet Sematary"" (2019) is an unnecessary remake, but still a decent one. I personally prefer the flamboyant 1989 film adaptation of Stephen King's novel; it was more garish and stylish, if a little campy. (And its flashback sequences involving one character's deceased sister are priceless horror fare.) But this sleeker, more restrained update is nonetheless still made and sometimes pretty scary. I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.The writing and directing are generally good, even if certain jump scares were so heavy-handed that they were nearly laughable. (The script wisely capitalizes on the universal, existential dread of mortality, as the first film did.) There are few new bells and whistles here; the 2019 film instead tries to distinguish itself with a key variation in the plot of King's eponymous 1983 book. (I won't describe it here, as I'm not certain whether it is a spoiler. But this change isn't ""shocking,"" as The New York Times' headline proclaims; it's simply a basic story alteration.)The cast is roundly quite good. A surprise standout for me was Amy Seimetz, who plays the mother of the story's troubled Creed family with surprising power and nuance. She's a damned excellent actress. And I was surprised to learn that I failed to recognize her as one of the doomed spacefarers from 2017's ""Alien: Covenant"" -- another role that required her to portray apprehension and panic.There were two possible nitpicks that occurred to me as I watched ""Pet Sematary,"" but these probably aren't the fault of the filmmakers, as they likely stem from the literary source material. (I read the book several times, but I was a young teenager when I did so.) As an adult, I am only a fuzzy on two story elements:How is the character of Victor Pascow (played here by Obssa Ahmed) able to offer help to the troubled Creed family? Can anyone in his circumstances do so? Might others step forward as well? Why should Pascow be uniquely motivated? (I am again trying to keep this review spoiler free.)
Why is the mother's traumatic childhood a factor in the story's present? It's ... mostly tangential, right? It is a compelling character element, and portrayed beautifully by Seimetz. But I don't fully understand how it seems to affect what transpires before us.
One final note -- I've seen a few people on the Internet compare John Lithgow's performance to that of Fred Gwynne in the 1989 film. (They both play the character of Jud, the family's elderly neighbor.) Lithgow is predictably wonderful here -- especially when Jud is showing kindness to the young daughter (played charmingly by Jete Laurence). But Gwynne was better, because he was so perfectly cast. It was a role that he was born to play.",Pet Sematary
142,eagandersongil,A breach of expectation,8,21 May 2019,"""Cursed Cemetery"" Lives up to its hype and consolidates itself as an ingenious adaptation, macabre and cruel, but good, with a genuine impregnated terror. I did not read the book by Stephen King that inspired the film, but I have read other of his works, and the adaptation made Kevin Kölsch, Dennis Widmyer seem to represent as all the intricacies King's work, which in many cases, become lighter and juveniles when they watch movies, this does not happen here.The script of the film is not surprising, without twists and turns or we have a legal deepening of characters, and nothing more, except for a defect that turns into a virtue. The predictability of the script, which shows scenes before the events of the future, we know the future steps at any moment, but the coldness that the story is told makes this agonizing to the viewer, because at all times a disaster image is painted in the following scenes, and we believe that this will happen, we prepare for the event, we close our eyes and breathe deeply, here there is no room for heroes or strength of protagonism, and the viewer knows this and suffers by anticipation that almost inadvertently gives a dose of terror psychological for the long. But it bothers me the fact that the characters do not question the great plot of the film hard, one of which is still linked to science, but it is not something that disrupts.Technically, ""Cemetery Cursed"" has everything a horror movie needs, a great mix of sound and an emerging and immersive track, plus a beautiful photograph that contrasts the light and the gray, another positive factor is the constant drop in expectation and the surprise, in addition, the charming and well-used handheld camera fulfills its role here, the criticism is due to the bad special effects, even with the low budget, the effects here, they became hideous and trash, which does not match with the film.I admit that no act charmed me, maybe I was disturbed or delighted with the film, but everyone is well in their roles, with Amy Seimetz and Jeté Laurence standing out.""Cemetery Cursed"" is a good adaptation and a pleasant surprise, I was caught completely off guard by the film that fulfills more than it promises, if showing a film that goes beyond just a juvenile terror, it is a sad drama with touches of psychological horror, suspense and terror, in a simple and well-knit way, knowing to respect their acts and laws, and closing in the perfect moment.",Pet Sematary
143,W011y4m5,Mediocrity at its most mediocre.,4,16 July 2019,"Trying to waste as little further time on this movie, I'll keep things brief; this is a painfully generic, overly simplistic horror movie & it's unremarkable slasher drivel. It prioritises cheap jump scares over exploring the genuinely unsettling psychological horror of the Pet Sematary concept & wastes any potential the movie had in order to be brilliant. Most irksome of all, I'm also expected to believe a small decomposing dead girl is more than capable of overpowering a grown adult man? Please.
Dialogue is clichéd, performances are wooden, the directing is average, the story overlooks everything that could've made it interesting & it makes for a forgettable, disappointing Stephen King adaptation. Meh!",Pet Sematary
144,jamiedarlow-37510,Changes to the original makes it lose scares and soul,4,22 June 2020,"The story follows the Creed family; a Doctor, his wife and two children.

Through a new family friend, Dr Creed discovers an Indian burial ground within their homes close proximity that within its sour ground, holds the power the bring the dead back from the grave. Only sometimes... Dead is better. The story and premise is absolutely brilliant and there's no faulting that so it's makes the director's decision to change aspects of it quite questionable especially when it dampens the overall scary effect the original had. Without giving away any spoilers, I found it not as effective. It's main saving grace is John Lithgow as their neighbour Jud; Lithgow can do no wrong and is pretty good here! The cat is also well realised and does provide the most unsettling scene in the film where it threatens a young boy in its crib just by sitting there... waiting.

The way I see it, I've read the book, I've seen the old movie, I'm into something new.The daughter is killed instead of the son, so the story plays out differently because a different character acts a different way so the outcome isn't the same. I found this more suspenseful because they weren't following what I already knew so I didn't know what was going to happen.

146,Sanpaco13,Poor remake,6,22 April 2019,"As a stand alone movie this would probably still only get about 7 stars from me. I'm of course familiar with the original film and was looking forward to the remake. Many remakes take on the task of telling the story in a new or interesting way and that was what I was hoping to get with Pet Sematary. Instead what I got was a poor cover band version of the original. Which is fitting given they used a poor cover band version of The Ramones ""Pet Sematary"" as the credit song.Let's start with what I liked. I really enjoyed some of the acting, especially John Lithgow as Judd. I thought he brought a deeper level to that character than the original, and I understood the character quite a bit better. The little girl who played Ellie also did a very good job playing first the sweet daughter and then the undead ghoul daughter. I also thought some of the effects were very cool and added an element of fantasy horror which was very characteristic of Stephen King. Specifically the parts in the dreams where Dr Creed would walk through a door into the forrest, almost like entering a different dimension.Now things I didn't like. I didn't like some of the cliches that added nothing to the story. For example the funeral procession of the kids at the beginning with the creepy masks. Yes this was creepy and foreboding, but what did it have to do with anything? Where did the kids come from? Why did they wear masks? It all seemed a little cliche for me. I also disliked all the teases to things from the original. Like Gage running into the road (as if I didn't watch the trailers which show that its the daughter that gets hit by the truck).",Pet Sematary
147,DeBBss,Someone Bury This Movie Please,3,11 May 2020,"Pet Sematary is what's everything wrong with the horror genre; it has the cheap jump scares, the predictable plot, and the cliches. The horror genre is slowly dying because of movies like these. The cliches make Pet Sematary feel like a Scary Movie sequel than an actual horror movie. Even though this story is an adapted screenplay and there's already feel another movie before this one, Pet Sematary still finds new ways to be even more unoriginal.First of all, Pet Sematary has a horrible screenplay. It has a poorly written family that's unlikable; there's little to know about this family except that they moved to Ludlow to get some more family time. The entire family is boring; none of the characters have unique traits that make them likable or relatable. The film mostly takes place in their house and I think that really limits the film's potential. We could've seen the family interact with the locals and make the locals seem scared, maybe even creepy, just something to add more mood to the movie. The only good thing is that the pacing was good and it helped with the entertainment factor.The characters are even worse, Louis taking the cake. Louis is supposed to be a down to earth logical guy, but for some reason he's the most stupid character in the movie. They've written it so that his character contradicts himself; and this begs the question, why couldn't Rachel be the one who starts the mess. Rachel's the one who's always with the family and she's mentally fragile; there could've been plenty of great scenes if they took that route, but they didn't for some reason. All of the characters in the movie are stupid too, not just Louis, and they're stupid for obvious reasons; it's to push the plot forward. Jud knows that the Pet semetary is an evil place, so why did he take Louis to bury his cat there. Couldn't they have written it more cleverly to make the characters look like they have more than two brain cells. The last thing I want to mention is how poorly used Victor Pascow was. His character was completely irrelevant throughout the movie and his only job was to warn Louis about Pet Sematary, but he barely did anything. If Victor Pascow was completely erased from the film, it wouldn't change a thing because he didn't even make Louis reconsider anything.Pet Sematary is a complete waste of time. It's filled with terrible jump scares and is predictable beyond belief. If you want to enjoy Pet Sematary, I'd recommend the original movie or the book; just don't pay for this dumpster fire of a movie.",Pet Sematary

152,movieman6-413-929510,The Pet Sematary remake works better thanks to some adjustments compared to the original film.,6,4 April 2019,"Pet Sematary is a remake of the 1989 film of the same name. This remake is directed by Kevin Kölsch, Dennis Widmyer, who also directed Starry Eyes and Holidays.In the film, doctor Louise Creed (Jason Clarke) and his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) and their two children have moved from Boston to the Maine countryside. Here he finds a mysterious cemetery where pets are buried. When their house cat Church has been hit and Louise finds him, his new neighbor Jud (John Lithgow) advises him to simply tell his children that Church has run away. Louise and Jud Church later buried together in the mysterious animal cemetery.
Despite her father's new Church running away, daughter Ellie (Jeté Laurence) still sees the cat walking around. Louis is surprised at how it is possible that Church is still alive and has found a way back to their home. Louise decides to do research on the animal cemetery to discover what makes the place so special.This remake has good adjustments compared to the original film, which makes the film more scary in a more serious way. The only thing that is missing compared to the original film is the presence of the real evil of the story. The reason for the evil things that happen in the film is only explained with words. Despite the fact that you can vaguely hear something about the presence of something dark, you unfortunately cannot see this clearly in the film. The film has a dark atmosphere, but it would have been more fun or creepy to have seen more.The effects are also greatly improved compared to the original film. Thanks to technical improvements, the things that were placed in the film with CGI now look a bit better than before. In addition to the CGI effects, they also make use of good make-up effects in the film, which help with the realistic transfer of certain events.The acting is also better than in the original film. Despite the fact that the film is somewhat lengthy during the scenes where the Creed family spends moments together, these scenes make the family look realistic as a real family that you as a viewer do care about. Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz do good acting in the film and John Lithgow also has a nice supporting role in the film. Young actress Jeté Laurence also provides very good acting for a starting actress of her age.",Pet Sematary

Seriously?The rest of the cast was boring to the point that I couldn't have cared less what happened to them.Replacing the original Church with Mrs. Norris was a joke. He was about as scary as Barney.WHY? WHY do people insist on remaking films that were perfect to start with?STOP!There's plenty of books on the market that could be made into films.

154,WalkdenEntertainment,I'm never owning a Cat..,7,3 April 2019,"Dr Louis Creed (James Clarke) along with his wife, daughter and son relocate from Boston to the woods for personal reasons. Soon the family encounters a number of bizarre events while settling in. Louis and his family even find a dark and mysterious type of burial ground for pets right behind their new home. They soon find there is more to this burial than just a ""Pet Sematary"".For those who are not aware, this film is based on the best selling novel by Stephen King and is actually a remake of a film from 1989. This review will not contain any spoilers or comparisons between the original film or book.Right off the bat, I must compliment the film's Audio track. For a horror film, the film's audio was a major highlight for me. I'm not talking about music- no! (NO!) I'm praising the incredible sound effects and editing that was used for this film. The effects alone had me a little tensed up and hiding under my shirt.As for plot, it's a horror film that is extremely dramatic and some may find emotionally draining. This film feels like it kicks right into motion with basic introductions to our characters as a perfect way to begin the story. The pace is rather consistent until we reach the crossover between the 2nd and 3rd act. Here the film slightly wobbles in its pace. One editing cut also completely distracted me, making the transition between scenes not match up, almost as if a scene was removed from the final film. After the film I also did do some thinking about the ending and the elements that lead up to the finale. Thankfully the core of the plot is explained rather well but unfortunately Pet Sematary enjoys giving the audience other scares or side plots which in the end are never fully explained or given any reason for them being in the film. These minor details or extra side plot are disappointing but really I would say it's a minor issue (it's a horror movie people).Our performances are also praise worthy, in particular from the actor Jason Clarke, who gives what I feel is one of his best performances seen in some time (especially if we compare it with his work in films like Winchester and Terminator Genysis). Actor John Lithgow was also amazing (as always!), but his character throughout the film comes across as rather predictable.Overall, this is a positive remake that has truly surprised me in many ways. It contains a surprising good performance from actor Jason Clarke and an Audio track that will make you want to hide under your shirt due to the tense moments. Naturally a film like this comes recommended to fans of the original film, the author Stephen King and those who enjoy a messed up horror film.7.4/10

155,dommercaldi,"Aside From A Couple Decent Scares, This Film Fails Massively",2,19 June 2020,"Pros:
1. The blood and gore is pulled off fantastically. The make-up department really pulled out all the stops.
2. There are a few instances of genuinely creepy imagery, especially the imagery revolving around Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine).
3. The ending is suitably bone-chilling, and ends with a surprisingly disturbing and unorthodox outcome.Cons:
1. The introduction is slightly bizarre and jarring as it starts with a slow and ominous zoom-in, but then quickly cuts to a Creed family bonding session with happy piano music playing in the background.
2. All of the jump-scares are cheap, obnoxious, and infuriating.
3. The score is overused, and so in-your-face that it ends up reducing the possible tension that could have been built.
4. There are a few really strange and distracting camera shots.
5. In some scenes, the resurrected Church looks blatantly fake.
6. The burial ground location looks like a Hollywood studio caked in smoke from a smoke machine.
7. There are a plethora plot-holes/ plot-conveniences, for example: A) Jud (John Lithgow) tells Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) how to bring back Church even though he knew there was a strong potential for Church to come back 'changed'. B) The film never explains why the Creed family proceeds to get haunted.
8. Very little of the character interactions and development are shown, instead they're dryly told through stale dialogue. For example, Jud tells of his deep liking for Ellie (Jeté Laurence), even though there had only been two scenes showcasing awkward interactions between them.
9. The sub-plot of Rachel (Amy Seimetz) facing her past with her sister, Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine), ends up coming to nothing and has no bearing on the plot.",Pet Sematary

1. Easily guess plot, what comes next. The clues are well exposed. (Frankly speaking, I have known WHAT is coming up next)
2. Camera angles are bad, too fast when changing from one position to the others.
3. Fake hair, fur are well noticed, even from the head of the daughter.Good aspects:
1. Sound effects
2. Acting, quite natural and realMaybe the story has to be made like ""Langoliers"", not showing any clues to the audience at the early stage of the film.Never seen the original..",Pet Sematary

and as I thought the original P.S movies were the best but still this remake is good enough to entertain you as long as it lasts.
there were some scenario issues and let's not fool our selves . if this was an original movie and not a remake it would be far better. that's the issue with the remakes. most of times the originals are better as u get to watch more or less the same stuff in the remake as u already know what's happening already.
this is a major disadvantage for a remake to deal with.
anyways still this is worth of your time.
especially the ending was great.

159,zac-04879,This Freaky and Twisted Remake Digs Deeper into Grief,6,11 September 2021,"If you consider dissecting this tolerable horror remake, you'll eventually discover that the concept isn't so much scary and chilling, it's just sad and sorrowful. 2019's Pet Sematary involves more of a focus on grief than gore, to the point where the twisted plot will create a deep sense of unsettlement in its viewers. Although that design's more dramatic than horrific, it's enough to provide dark eeriness and easily takes your concern to position it in the story.The remake also messes around and shifts multiple of the 1989 classic's plans and aims. The emotions replace the original's gruesome thoughts, but there's a change in the death orders and depth in the characters. Jason Clarke and John Lithgow are able to strengthen the ability to compel the movie's audiences.Although Pet Sematary is entertaining enough and is interesting to focus on feelings, it lacks the anticipated tension and true terror. The original was able to slowly increase the tensity and perfectly scared you at times, whereas the pure suspense is left to the last 20 minutes. Thanks to the music, acting and darkness, the films grows darker and chillingly ominous before the average climatic sequence. The repositioning of the design is pretty clever, but unfortunately loses the battle between being better than the old classic.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Pet Sematary

Well. that happened here. The movie is way more better and scarier that what people say it is, the ending is shockingly scary and intense, the main flick with Ellie dying was very well adapted and brought to the movie as a complete shocker, as it is in the books.

163,darkreignn,Legitimately scary and shocking,9,10 April 2019,"""Pet Sematary"" is the latest and greatest Steven King adaption, only available at a theatre near you!I saw this movie opening night because of how well executed the very first trailer was. No spoilers, practically no information about the plot of any kind, and chock-full of creepy imagery and scary children wearing animal masks. What more could a 23 year old man working in health insurance, working paycheck to paycheck, and planning on buying a 2019 used C class Mercedes Benz ask for? Now, I knew literally nothing about this movie going in. I didn't watch any trailers besides the first one, and I never read the book that the film is based on, so with a title like ""Pet Sematary."" I only assumed that it was about zombie animals rising from the dead and terrorizing the neighborhood. And for the first hour, that was almost where the movie seemed to be leaning. Thing happened, and I was certain that any minute now the film would pic up, the animals would start crawling out of their shallow graves, and we'd get our zombie movie. But something else happened.An hour in this movie, something happened that took me, and everyone else in the theatre, by surprise. My entire audience literally gasped and went silent. I stared at the screen in awe, realizing that now the entire trajectory of the film changed, and from that point I was 100% hooked.Listen, am I drunk right now? Of course, that's a given. What else is a given? That unfortunately, just like every other movie except ""Mr. Nobody,"" ""Pet Sematary"" does have it's fair share of issues. Yes, I just got done saying I completely loved and was engrossed by the entire final hour of this film, including the ending, which I thought was perfect, but the first hour still has some problems. For the first hour, the pacing felt a bit off and too quick for its own good; this movie would've greatly benefited from an extra hour or 45 minutes of screen time. Now, after the big reveal you will understand exactly why everything was paced the way it was (basically they just wanted to get to that twist as soon as humanely possible), but that still doesn't excuse the fact that they blew through a lot of things in a short of time, making a lot of emotional and pivotal moments feel rushed and awkward instead of emotional and impactful. And really, the pacing is the biggest downfall of this movie. It makes so many scenes feel uncomfortable, like a doctor who's trying to rush you out of his office so he can hurry up and see the next patient before that lunch time shot of vodka. It just almost makes it seem like the film doesn't care about us as audience members, and doesn't want to take the time to allow us to get to know the characters and their histories as fully as we could.But really other than that, the second half of this movie was so unexpected, so shocking, so engrossing, and so scary, that I couldn't help but love this film. It took me completely by surprise and held my attention all the way through to the end, thanks in part by the phenomenal acting by literally every single actor in this film; no one felt like they were phoning it in. ""Pet Sematary"" may have pacing issues, but the excellent acting, fantastic second half, and legitimately scary plot make up for it.9/10Thanks for reading!",Pet Sematary
164,Aly200,"Indeed dead is better, darker than before but not quite worth it",6,6 April 2019,"In 1983, Stephen King reluctantly published his most disturbing (outside of IT that followed 3 years later) novel about the title place that resurrects the dead but with dire consequences. King adapted the 1989 screenplay for Mary Lambert that resulted in a faithful but hardly terrifying (except for the reanimated Miko Hughes as Gage Creed) version of the novel. However as the Chicago Tribune review for this 2019 remake pointed out was the '89 film honed in the themes of grief and consequences for Louis' Creed's actions while the new film is more analytical with the concept of the afterlife and its possible existence. Terrific criticism and of the many stark differences between the films (and the book too).For a quick recap that is now a story as old as time in the King literary world, the Creed family moves to little old Ludlow, Maine, find the title burial and horrible tragedies ensue with deadly consequences when the family patriarch makes a fateful decision to cope with his grief.
While the 1989 cast was virtually wooden or whiny, actors Fred Gwynne and little Miko Hughes stood out as Jud Crandall and Gage Creed respectively. Here a more emotive and capable cast turns in decent though so-so performances. Jason Clarke as Dr. Louis Creed definitely brings more emotion than predecessor Dale Midkiff, but the actor does struggle with his emotions of grief upon the death of one of his children. While he does shed a tear at the funeral, the sadness fades quickly as he shifts immediately to the decision that will ruin his life for good. However Clarke has a more believable chemistry with his on-screen wife compared to Midkiff and Denise Crosby as Louis and Rachel do come across as loving, but at odds with their views on death as Rachel struggles with her trauma regarding her late sister.
Speaking of Rachel Creed, actress Amy Seimatz shines brightly with a more accurate Rachel compared to Denise Crosby. Seimatz brings out Rachel's fear of death and trauma more realistically as she suffers nightmares and visual hallucinations matching PTSD. Poor Rachel still suffers the same gruesome fate as the novel gives her at the hands of her beloved child.
For the newcomer to the role of Ellie Creed, young Jete Laurence brings a unique spin to the eldest Creed child. Far from the annoying and whiny mess of the '89 film, Laurence is precocious, smart and ultimately ill-fated. Now if you haven't the spoiler-y second trailer or the film, Ellie becomes the undead Creed child as opposed to her brother in the original film and novel. However this doesn't detract from Laurence having to 'play dead' for the rest of the film. Initially Ellie seems oddly normal after her return, but quickly turns menacing and violent the next day as she terrorizes her father and then her two victims. The actress even reverts to her sweet girl façade briefly at the climactic showdowns with her parents, but we and her family know what a monster she is now.
Finally there is the underused John Lithgow inheriting the role of Jud Crandall. The film veteran brings a grizzled and worldly look that varies on Fred Gwynne's farmer-like look from the '89 film. However Lithgow tries his best to be the catalyst for the events of the film, but his role is significantly reduced compared to his predecessor and is ultimately only a victim rather than the complex figure King created on the page or the humbly remorseful man Gwynne played using King's prose well. It is not Lithgow's fault we don't get to feel so much for Jud as he does what he can with so little material to craft the character any King knows.Can we ban Jeff Buehler from writing horror films now? After making the bland and cliché 'Truth or Dare' last spring, this director became the screenwriter of this adaptation. However Buehler heavily misses the core themes of what makes this King book one of the most disturbing ever. The story is about grief, death and its effects on the human psyche and of course the Frankenstein morale of man playing God and its horrific consequences, but Buehler turns this movie into ""Does the afterlife exist?"" which is not what King even touches in the book. While Louis does engage in the act of burying Ellie in his grief, the consequences are not nearly as impactful as the original book or even the 1989 film. It turns into a quick beat slasher and hurries to the end which leaves much to be desired. However one element that Buehler gets right is including the Wendigo and its legend (though toned down to the violent aspects of the legend) which any reader of the book knows is the heart of the evil behind the cemetery.",Pet Sematary
165,gabriel_sanchez,Chilling horror movie. Weak adaptation.,7,27 October 2021,"I guess it is natural that movie adaptations from books get mixed to negative reviews. Books can go on for as long as they want, with much more detail and time to develop characters, emotions, plots and subplots, among other narration characteristics. Movies are quite different than books; they are an art of their own like books.With that in mind, I must say I never read the full Stephen King's Pet Sematary novel. Only a quick reader's digest with enough to understand the movie is different. So, if you are looking for a word-by-word adaptation, seek elsewhere. God, in fact, stop seeking, to be honest; you will never find such adaptation.Doctor Louis Creed moves to Ludlow, Maine, so he can have more quality time with his family by trying to work less. After his daughter Ellie's cat dies, his neighbor and friend Jud asks him to bury the cat in the pet cemetery, which would result in his resurrection. The problem is the cat is now acting strange.To me, the major problem this film has is that it feels rushed. I guess rushed movies are what happens when a book has that content depth that is in between ""too much for one movie"" but ""too little for more than one movie"". And this movie suffers from this fate.We only get to the real s*** by half of the movie. So buck your seatbelt for a slow ride, building for the main plot twist.There are major changes from this movie compared to King's novel. If you watch it from this point of view, you will get frustrated.From a standalone movie point of view, it is alright. Chilling, for sure.

These two actresses are the soul of the revised story, and they make the third act feel like a real gut-wrenching scary movie, the kind of movie that truly delivers in the promise of making you clench, feel scared and hopeless until the credits roll.While it is true that they changed a basic plot from the Stephen King novel, the change actually works for hat they wanted to achieve.I give Pet Sematary a 6 out of 10, it was enjoyable enough but not for repeat viewing as the original adaptation.

172,Bertaut,"Not bad, but not a patch on the book, and the new ending is awful",6,11 April 2019,"In Stephen King's celebrated oeuvre, his 1983 novel Pet Sematary (the misspelling is intentional) is something of a curio. Although reasonably well received at the time, critics have never considered it worthy of the kind of attention lavished on work such as The Shining, The Stand, The Dark Tower series, It, Misery, or The Green Mile. Fans of King, however, have long championed it as one of his most emotionally devastating and philosophically complex works, whilst King himself considers it the scariest novel he's ever written. And although on the surface, the plot is as schlocky as they come, buried underneath is an examination of grief and how it can compromise one's ability to act rationally, whilst also looking at issues such as emotional trauma, guilt, the importance of family, and the question of what happens after we die.Written by Jeff Buhler, from an initial script by Matt Greenberg, and directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, Pet Sematary comes in the midst of something of a resurgence for the Stephen King adaptation industry. However, for me, much like It (2017), Pet Sematary doesn't really work. It's certainly better that Mary Lambert's 1989 filmic adaptation, Pet Sematary (1989), but it pales in comparison to the novel. Granted, most films suffer when compared to a source text; even Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), although a masterpiece as a standalone film, is a terrible adaptation of the novel. Pet Sematary, which relies far too heavily on jump scares, is especially disappointing in this sense insofar as it starts off very strongly, taking care to respectfully modernise the novel's themes and examine the characters' underlying emotions, before descending into absolute stupidity in the last act. Buhler also changes numerous aspects of the story; some of which work very well, but many don't, with a new ending, in particular, substituting cheap shock for the lingering sense of psychological hopelessness with which King's original so memorably concludes.Louis Creed (Jason Clarke), a doctor from Boston, moves to the town of Ludlow, Maine with his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), their eight-year-old daughter Ellie (Jeté Laurence), three-year-old son Gage (Hugo Lavoie and Lucas Lavoie), and Ellie's beloved cat, Church. In the woods surrounding their house, Ellie finds a pet cemetery, but is cautioned against exploring further by their friendly neighbour, Jud Crandall (John Lithgow). Several weeks later, Louis and Jud find Church dead, and Jud, who has grown very close to Ellie and doesn't wish to see her suffer, takes Louis to an ancient Mi'kmaq burial ground behind the cemetery, instructing Louis to bury Church. The next day, Louis is stunned when Church returns home, although considerably more aggressive than before he died. Jud explains that anything buried in that place comes back to life, although very different from how it was, with local legend suggesting that returnees are possessed or controlled by some sort of malevolent spirit. A few days later, the Creed family suffers an unspeakable tragedy, and guessing what Louis plans to do, Jud tells him not to return to the burial ground. Louis, however, has no intention of heeding his warnings.When the film version was first revealed, there was a lot of online grumbling about the big change - it's Ellie and not Gage who is killed in the film, and whom Louis decides to bring back (if this was supposed to be a twist, someone forgot to tell the marketing people, because it's right there in the trailer). However, King himself approved the change, and personally, I think it improves the story - as in the novel, it's Ellie with whom Louis and Rachel have portentous conversations about what happens after we die, and having her be the one killed establishes a more coherent thematic through-line.Speaking of themes, much like the novel, the film is primarily focused on grief. I've always loved King's ability to ""hide"" serious themes behind what are ostensibly rote horror stories (he's so good at hiding them that literary academics don't believe they're even there, refusing to afford him a place on the canon). And yes, Pet Sematary does feature a sentient zombie child, but its core is the emotional trauma suffered by Louis and how his uncontrollable grief drives him to do something unspeakable. His heartache is such that his logic centre simply stops functioning; not only does he completely accept the fact that Ellie can be brought back, but he also ignores Louis's warnings that she will not be his Ellie. Like in the book, he's a man of science, who clashes with Rachel about what to tell Ellie regarding death - she wants to talk about an afterlife, he wants to focus on the finality of death as something natural and unavoidable. This is a smart choice by King, as Louis becomes the one who refuses to let death have the final word, with his conscious mind unable to accept the random tragedy that has befallen him, and whose entire purpose in life comes to be focused on the fact that Rachel was (at least in part) correct, that there is something after death.Rachel's arc moves in the opposite direction to Louis's - she accepts the finality of Ellie's death, and reacts in horror when she learns what her husband has done. Her arc is rendered more complex insofar as she also suffers crippling guilt because of the death of her sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine) when they were still children, for which she blames herself. Whereas Louis's arc is more concerned with the question of what it takes for a rational man to abandon everything he knows to be unassailably true about the nature of existence, Rachel's looks at questions of survivor guilt and how one is supposed to come back from having one's life shattered (of course, it's the very fact that Rachel had this early-life trauma that gives her the tools with which to cope with Ellie's death).For about two-thirds of the runtime, the film deals reasonably convincingly with these issues. Sure, it moves faster than the novel, but that's more to do with the nature of medium than anything else. Whereas Kubrick largely ignored the themes of alcoholism and abuse in The Shining, Kölsch and Widmyer go in the opposite direction - grief and guilt are really the only things on which they focus. At least up to the point when they seem to forget about them entirely, as the third act descends into a ridiculously campy series of murders, attempted murders, and all round violence.The last half-hour or so is as superficial and immature as anything in any King adaptation, and the new ""twist"" ending not only doesn't work on its own terms, it completely undercuts both King's original themes, and how well the film itself had handled those themes earlier on, replacing King's bleakly poetic dénouement with something right out of ""horror clichés for dummies"". I've no problem with filmmakers altering the end of a literary adaptation; the finale of Frank Darabont's The Mist (2007), for example, is completely different from King's novel, but it replicates the spirit of the original. However, the whole point of the end of the novel is that Louis has learned nothing from his experience bringing Gage back. The tragedy is that, lost in madness and despair, he repeats his mistakes. The end of the film has none of this, with the final shot more of a silly ""dun-dun-duuuun"" moment.Another problem is something common to many films - an overly idealised family; much more so than in the novel, the Creeds are a picture postcard family, where everybody just loves everybody else so much, dad is always cracking jokes, sister hates annoying little brother (but loves him really), and parents talk to their kids like they're already fully grown adults. Another problem is that Ellie doesn't just get hit by a truck, she's flattened by a tanker, but when Louis picks her body up, she's still whole, and when we see her in the coffin, there's literally not a mark on her. Why make the crash so spectacular when the body has to be intact for the rest of the movie?The film also leaves out almost all of the backstory and mythology of the burial ground and the role of the Wendigo (an evil necromantic spirit spoken of in Algonquin folklore); Louis sees a picture of the Wendigo in a book, but it's unnamed, and later, he thinks he sees something in the distance of the fog-shrouded forest, but that's as close as we ever get to it.As a novel, Pet Sematary is a study of grief and childhood trauma first, a horror narrative second. Investigating our psychological reaction to death, the book probes how far we might go to ensure a loved one never leaves us. As a film, Pet Sematary seems to be charting a similar course, until it abandons this tack in favour of a shock-for-shock's sake ending. Much like It: Chapter One, there is an over-reliance on predictable and silly jump scares, and ultimately, what could have been a mature and emotionally affecting story gives in to the worst excesses of the genre, betraying both itself and the original novel.",Pet Sematary

The first 45 minutes are by the numbers and safely played according to the novel and the original fim. Then the story takes a U-turn and anything seems to be possible.

It was made for the fans. Closely following the events of the original film, this movie has few, yet major changes. The pace of the film is very much like that of the original as well. Like the latter, I wouldn't exactly say these are horror films, but rather potent family dramas crafted by horror auteurs. The problem here was that now, after 30 years of new and epic horror films, its hard to suspend belief to this story even though it seemed so believable in the original. That's because it was new then. It was fresh. To see these humans going through these sequences and supernatural dilemmas in the now almost feels fake and over the top.

We spent a bit of time during the film discussing why would you buy a house and be oblivious that it is next to the Daytona racetrack for lorries when you have a cat and 2 young children. You then think it is a good idea to play hide and seek next to the road. You bring the cat back to life and it is a snarling vicious monster, and you think your daughter will not come back the same way. The ending is ridiculous like a cheap zombie movie.",Pet Sematary
181,cgearheart,Doesn't deserve the hate it's getting; scary as hell,8,15 April 2019,"Though I haven't seen the original, this film is a genuinely scary and suspenseful fright fest that left me gripping my seat and urging my date to hold my hand because I was so frightened. I don't get scared easily, but the new Pet Sematary got under my skin and stayed there, even managed to give me a nightmare. I haven't seen the original and do I really have to? It's old and outdated now, and while the original may be nostalgic, it was never the best horror film to begin with.B+",Pet Sematary
182,foxtografo,Not great,6,6 July 2019,"I disliked it until the ending. I think it saves the movie.
I don't remember if it's the same than the old one, but it doesn't matter, it was the best of the whole movie.
The movie failed to give set the atmosphere to me, maybe it was the cinematography that wasn't impressive or dark enough for the theme, or the pace that was slow at times and rushed at important moments, I can't point exactly at what it was, but I think it was a miss.
The wife's subplot felt completely unnecessary for me, what was the point of that?!
Still, most of the acting was quite good, and again, the ending saved it, but It's a very forgettable movie.
Another fail of unnecessary remake.",Pet Sematary
183,MickeyTheConstant,"Not scary, laughable",5,21 April 2021,This is so not scary. Me and the wife found the cat really funny. It was all very boring. You just thought after seeing the deranged moggy why would the dad bring his dead son to the cemetery. Also why would Lithgows character convince the Dad to do this when he did it to his dog who went nuts and had to be put down. Not worth watching.,Pet Sematary
184,Otkon,Not nice....,4,21 April 2019,"....or very interesting. Yeah, they changed up a few things. But the joy of the novel and the original movie was that the resurrected child in question was a toddler. His death was all the more tragic by this fact. And when he comes back as a murderous imp, it is all most chilling because of how he just wanted ""to play with you"". The tweenage girl's post-mortem descent was so fast that it wasn't rewarding or fun.Of course the new ending implies that the ghoulish trio (and cat) will just murder and bury new Gage in order to remake a happily now-undead family. But so what. I never really emotionally connected with this group to begin with. The father was a blank-faced dud. The mother must have been listed as generic blond actress on the casting sheet. Lithgow was the only redeemable presence. Not even the truly terrifying Zelda subplot worked this time around.A wholly unnecessary and underdeveloped remake that should have stayed in the ground.",Pet Sematary

To leave out the character development of the relationship between Lithgow Clarke characters was nonsensical. I mean it is THE core pivotal plot development element of the storyline.
Like a bus service that doesn't pick up passengers lest it get behind its timetable this film just bypassed all of that.
It was also obviously the wrong ending and they know it. The car scene well, I'll let the viewer decide for themselves but I guarantee there will be an alternate ending in the DVD.
The film would have been better if the writers and directors had spent a few days immersing themselves in good suspense and horror films.

189,RhapsodyReviews,"Not Good, but Better Than the Original.",4,3 October 2019,"Review:
'Pet Sematary' is an American supernatural-horror film directed by Kevin Kölsch. It is the second adaptation of the 1983 novel of the same name by Stephen King. This is probably one of the hardest reviews I had to write. The movie isn't so much complex as it is just confusing to my personal emotions. It wasn't horrible, but I thought it lacked depth and originality. Its hard to make scary movies nowadays let alone live up to a Steven King novel, but this movie could have been loads better than what we were given.
The film follows a family that discovers a mysterious graveyard in the woods behind their new home. Upon burying their family cat in the cemetery, it returns home from the dead and a series of horrible events happen leaving the family in scrambles.
The acting aside from Jason Clarke wasn't the greatest. I think Jason Clarke is trying his best to keep this movie afloat. He steals every scene, but when it doesn't seem like anybody else is trying very hard that's not saying much. Even John Lithgow was lacking in this movie. His character really wasn't given much to do in the first place, but he could have given us something other than the old man next door.
It started off with the right creepy vibe and sets you up to be spooked and wanting more. It does down hill when you realize this is a movie that you'd see late at night on the Lifetime channel you stumbled upon late at night.
Overall, this movie isn't bad; I liked it more than the 1989 original movie. It's just not one that I will revisit again soon.

191,hunter-friesen,"""Pet Sematary"" is uneven horror experience",6,16 April 2019,"What if you had the option to bring someone back from the dead? Would you seize the opportunity to get a second chance or would you turn away and leave the dead as they were?With his 1983 cult book, ""Pet Sematary"", author Stephen King posed and gave a grisly answer to this very question.Centering around the Creed family, the story begins with them having just moved to, Maine. They live in a quaint country home that just so happens to have an eerie burial ground for long deceased pets that sits in their backyard.Just days after moving in, the family cat is found dead. Not wanting to upset his daughter, Louis decides to bury the animal before she finds out. Lending a hand is neighbor Judd, who shows Louis a spot above the burial ground that possesses power beyond human reason.Suddenly the cat is back from the dead, but this time it is much more mean and mangy.After some time, another major tragedy strikes the family. Distraught from his loss, Louis goes back to the supernatural spot in order to bring his loved one back. Louis does get his wish, but it doesn't turn out the way he wanted, resulting in a lesson that teaches that death always wins in the end.Directed by partners Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, ""Pet Sematary"" is a film that tells a tale of two halves in terms of pacing and excitement.The first half turns out to be quite boring as the story is slowly unfolded in order to touch on the most minute of details. After the pivotal moment that climaxes the buildup, the second half picks up speed and is able to be the horror film it wants to be.Just like the runtime, the scare tactics used in the first half very much pale compared to the latter half.The first hour consisted solely of identically structured jump scares that became more and more predictable as they kept happening. But once the recycled startling is over, the real horror sets in as Kölsch and Widmyer do great work by authentically building up terror through the atmosphere and actor performances.Almost identical with the quality of the directing is the writing by Jeff Buhler.Despite being a pretty simple concept for audiences to grasp, Buhler spends a fairly large chunk of the film tediously explaining every fact surrounding the narrative. This incessant need for overly expositive storytelling grinds the film to a crawl and made me feel like I was in a glorified lecture where the professor would never stop talking.Before I had mentioned that the first hour is filled with recycled jump scares. While some of that blame can be put on the directors for not trying hard enough, much of it goes to Buhler for not giving the directors enough to work with. Each scare consisted of the same steps: a character would hear a noise coming from a low lit area, they would slowly walk over to it, open a door or cupboard, the music cuts out and then suddenly a loud noise jolts you.You would think adapting a Stephen King would give Buhler a good supply of material to scare people with and stop him from writing a series of mindless startles that everybody experiences on a daily level, but it turns out you'd be wrong.Contrary to most horror films, Pet Sematary boasts some quality acting within its tight-knit cast.Jason Clarke does a respectable job as the tormented father Louis. Even though his character is the most boring - which is attributable to the writing - Clarke is able to develop his character past the limitations posed onto him.Amy Seimetz does great work as Rachel Creed. Her character has an interesting backstory that she uses to its fullest potential, especially in her closeup reaction shots.John Lithgow plays Judd and turns in a good performance as a weathered old man who unintentionally starts and eventually gets caught up in the bloody mess.Finally, considering the amount of work she has to do and the quality of the material given to her, child actor Jeté Laurence ends up being surprisingly outstanding as the young daughter, Ellie.Just like the concept it explores, ""Pet Sematary"" is a film that lays dormant in its first half but is able to resurrect itself and deliver on the thrills and chills it promised. You could do worse at finding a horror film that chews up a few hours out of your day. But you could also do better.",Pet Sematary

If you think you may know the story based on the original, you'll be pleasantly surprised to see how they've changed and adapted it for today's viewers....while maintaining the psychological horror, gore, and general creepiness that comes with watching the story of a family that moved onto a property that happens to contain a cursed Indian burial ground. Overall this is a great film, which shouldn't be compared to the original but rather viewed on it's own. If you're a fan of horror films, or even just like Stephen King, this a great one to see.

195,snowfre,A predictable horror story suffering from mediocre acting,6,5 October 2019,"""Per Sematary"" is a very typical Stephen King horror story, which also means that it is about 10 times more suitable in its book format than for the big screen. When adapting this film (for a second time), the result becomes a predictable, mechanic horror movie that for most parts lacks anything resembling horror at all. The acting is also very unsatisfying, with the exception of the film's oldest and second-youngest cast members, John Lithgow and Jeté Laurence. They cannot save this slow-moving flick however, that has many more negative aspects than positive ones. While the overall tone of the film is dark, the cinematography and green screens leaves some wishes unfulfilled, and at times, the film feels more like a failed comedy-horror than an actual horror film. ""Pet Samatary"" is completely relying on jump scares and it is not until the last quarter of the film that somewhat of an unsettling feel is brought upon you. What is strange is that the charming chemistry between the family and their neighbor Crandall (Lithgow) is more memorable than the most spooky moments. There is an overflow of Stephen King films right now, and very few deliver anything close to what you can expect from films with such strong source materials. ""Pet Samatary"" isn't one of them.",Pet Sematary
196,zathan-32848,Not very scary,5,8 May 2019,"The movie was ok to watch, but it will soon be forgotten. The most amazing part was that they managed to fit a somali pirate into the movie.. That was hilarious. Story, acting, cinematography and production is very good...",Pet Sematary
197,plasticanimalz,Trailer is Scarier Than Actual Movie,4,31 July 2019,"Based on the trailer I thought this would be scary and fun. Instead, it was boring, not scary, and made no sense. After 45 mins of next to nothing STILL not happening, I shut it off. If I didn't already know the story I would have no idea what this movie is about which means a terrible script. I haven't seen the original in a while but I remember it holding up as a creepy film. This was just one meandering scene from one to the next with little to no building of tension, which is what Stephen King is known for. Like, he already lays that out for you so if you can't pick up the ball and run with it there's a serious problem.In the original it made more sense why the family was living near this road. In the modern day with Google Maps, and helicopter parents, how did they not know 18-wheelers go whizzing down that road? And a doctor, who fixes people up for a living, I can't imagine in this modern era where free-range kids are no more, a big city doctor would choose a house so close to a commuter road. Also, while any kid dying is a tragedy, it's simply more painful for the younger one to go. They fact that they're so innocent at that point is more impact. Why exactly do kids get dressed in antique looking costumes that are all macabre and have an old colonial drum? Those kinds of masks are expensive, and who's parents are buying them for them, let alone, what kids would actually do that? While it looked cool in the trailer, once executed it was weird.As I remember...though, it was a while ago, burying the cat was an accident. Or maybe I'm wrong, but it simply made no sense that the neighbor steers the daughter away from going to the dead place but then when the cat dies the neighbor takes the dad on some excursion at night, in the dark, to what looked miles away through bog land to bury a cat? Uh, first off, both of them would have broken their legs crawling up that huge log pile in the dark, or would have somewhere else in all that uneven terrain. Not forgetting, of course, why would John Lithgow tell the daughter not to go there, it's a bad place, then take that dad to create an evil zombie cat. If the neighbor has lived there his whole life he would know the cat would come back all messed up. And, what is bog land doing in Massachusetts or Maine? It never really clarified where they lived. Bog land is not in the upper hemisphere of the country. I was waiting for them to stumble upon Atreyu and Artax in the Swamp of Despair. Random bog is signature '80s kids movie: Neverending Story, Labyrinth, Krull. And the sister falling down the shaft...what? How would she have gotten up there. It was really hard for me to get into the story as I found either something completely unbelievable, or the mom or dad was going off on pointless dream sequences or memories.And the whole dead student narrating to the dad...what? So cheesy and amateur. Then there's the dad dreaming, walking through the door into the woods...lame. The directing is not much better than the writing. There were also multiple dream sequence and memory flashbacks within the first 45 minutes...I think 5. That's a lot. They're considered to be weak story telling and are not supposed to be used unless totally necessary, or you're Quentin Tarantino, and are usually a sign of an amateur.A great story I think they could have done a lot with and I think simply the fact the writer / directors do not have much under their belt really shows.",Pet Sematary

Acting is okay, not great. I didnt really like the cast which is disappointing. They are not really that interesting and they make really dumb choices, even worse than the original.Cinematography/effects:
The camera shots were cool as expected, although not much better than the original. The effects were good but like the whole movie just seems disappointing.Story:
This is the worst part for me, the story is absolutely the friken same as the original!. Like why? I mean they switched up who died and some little things but I was really bored and I knew exactly what was gonna happen. I wished they didnt copy the last one but made a twist to it.Conclusion:
I mean you can watch it if you have to, and it probably wont be that bad If you haven't seen the original. Otherwise I would stay away from this film, it's just disappointing and that makes Jack a dull boy.",Pet Sematary

209,theredsky,Pet Sematary (2019) Review,3,5 December 2019,"I've never read the original novel nor watched the 1989 film but man was this bland. This film is barely over an hour and a half but it feels like two. Pet Sematary is an incredibly boring film. There were aspects I liked about the film but they get buried under this snooze fest. Most of the acting is pretty bad except from Jason Clarke and John Lithgow. Both do a good job but they don't really bring anything new to the table. Jete Laurence and Amy Seimetz were pretty bad in this film. Clarke and Lithgow were able to make the terrible script work for them but Laurence and Seimetz fell victim to it. It also doesn't help that their characters aren't that great and aren't fleshed out a lot. The make-up effects are pretty great when they are used but they aren't used in scenarios where they should have been used. If someone gets hit by a huge trailer there probably should be a little bit of blood not no blood at all. It removes all tension from the scene. They could have just shown some blood and no body. They would have left it up to the imagination of the viewer to think about what that person's mangled body looked like. The music and cinematography are incredibly bland and generic. The music sounded like stock horror music and the cinematography was basic and boring. The film has a swamp set that they decided to use a green screen background for and it's really noticeable. The editing is not terrible but it's not good either. It just felt weird compared to the other films I have seen this year. The concept of Pet Sematary is definitely intriguing but this film takes that concept and makes it seem very dull. I was bored out of my mind when I was watching it and was on the verge of falling asleep. I need to watch the original version now to get this out of my mind. Overall, Pet Sematary has an interesting premise based on already existing material but the bad acting, bland cinematography, weak script, and just being uninteresting bring the film way down.",Pet Sematary

211,el7,It's unsettling.,7,3 June 2020,"I love the 1989 film based on this novel, at the same time recognizing that little Gage in the first movie is unintentionally hilarious, and the ending is not as satisfying as the end of the novel. So I was skeptical when I heard there was going to be a remake. The original has held up well enough that it was rather puzzling. It didn't help that the trailer is just not very good. However, the story from the novel remains a creepy delight that reignited my curiosity to see how someone could put it to film, and I don't regret watching this movie. It's based on the same material, so if you've seen the first one, just know going in that Victor is still going to say the ground is sour, Jud is still going to say ""A man's heart is stonier, Louis,"" and the cat is still going to meet an unfortunate end. However, they've added a twist this time, with a little misdirection to throw the viewer off, and it solves the problem of 'how do you make a two year-old terrifying without CGI.' (You don't.) Zelda falling remains one of the most intense jump scares I've ever seen in a horror movie, and this movie switched that up a little bit too, putting it in a different spot with more backstory. For the most part I'm pleased with the subtle changes and additions made in this version of the story. It doesn't supplant the original movie in my horror movie affections, but it's good in its own right, and while the ending still isn't as good as the novel's, it is unsettling in a way that stays with you longer.",Pet Sematary
212,Genti23,Intensely terrifying,9,4 April 2019,"Pet Samatary is a horror movie based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. I haven't seen the first adaptation of the novel, which came out back in 1989, and I haven't read the novel either. I didn't watch any of the trailers and only read a brief description of the plot, so I was walking in blind in the movie. And boy, was it disturbing and terrifying, but at the same time so well made and incredibly acted.
The directing duo of Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer do a fantastic job at keeping the suspense alive and running all throughout the movie. It is incredibly shot with a very eerie atmosphere and great cinematography. Jason Clarke as one of the leading roles, gives an amazing performance, one which most horror movies lack, a performance with passion. However. in my opinion the real stand out here is Jeté Laurence who plays the little girl Ellie. She does a great job on the role, and while many times kids in horror movies only ruin the scenes with their inexperienced acting, she steals the scenes, especially on the second half of the film when she's not that innocent anymore.
This is a great movie in my opinion, one of my favourite horrors ever, and I would recommend it day one.",Pet Sematary
213,tinovalkki,Why try fix unbroken?,5,24 April 2019,"Old saying ""why try to fix unbroken"" works well with this movie. The old version of this movie, written by Stephen King himself was chilling horror movie which gave you lots of nightmares. This new version is very pale shade of it. Script is party rewritten, but why I really don't know. It is suppose to be horror movie, but to me it is bad thriller, which makes you laugh more than scare. Especially the end of the movie is stupid. There are some nice scenes to scare you, but the mood of film is not very horror. If you haven't seen the original film, this might be ok movie, but if you have seen the original, this makes you more laugh than be scared. If you like Stephen King books, this is one of those must see, but to be an actual horror movie it is quite lame.Mainly the movie seems to be ok. In the beginning part of the movie it built it's mood quite well, but the second half, which suppose to be dark and horror, makes you more laugh, than to be scary. Acting is good, especially John Lithgow's Jud as nice old neighbor guy is as good as it can be. Devil cat ""Church"" is more laughable than scary and the movie horror mood seems to fail more than bring chills to your spine.If you haven't read the book or haven't seen the first movie, this might, just might be ok to watch. For us who have seen the first movie or read the book this brings more second-hand embarrassment, than chills.",Pet Sematary
214,TheMovieDoctorful,Sometimes The Book is Better,3,11 April 2019,"This is an extremely difficult review for me to write. I am absolutely heartbroken by the way this film turned out. Pet Sematary has been referred to by author Stephen King himself as the scariest book he's ever written and I'm inclined to agree; a deeply personal, unnerving and haunting story of the descent into madness caused by grief and possessive attachment to one's loved ones. I also don't consider the 1989 film to be very good either, so I had extremely high hopes for this one. Nobody wanted this movie to be good more than I did. Nobody was rooting for it harder. Nobody wanted to praise it more than me...And I can't. As much as it pains me to say it, Pet Sematary (2019) is not a good movie.There are good things in it, to be sure. Jete Laurence absolutely steals the show as Ellie Creed. She can be adorable, sweet and endearing just as effectively as she can be hateful, distant and intimidating. Her best moments are upon the first couple scenes after her resurrection, where she could easily pass for both, falling into an uncomfortable and unsettling gray area where we desperately want to believe that the Ellie we know has returned. Child acting in general has been on the rise in terms of quality the past few years and Laurence's phenomenal performance is no exception. She dominates the screen here.Anyone wondering how well the film updates Church from the 1989 original can rest assured that his depiction is pretty much perfect here. Much like Laurence's performance as Ellie, the film does a great job balancing the cat's cuteness with his creepy soullessness. There were even times I wondered whether Church was a practical effect or not.I've heard critics talk about the film as an allegory for masculine fragility and the patriarchal refusal to relinquish any control of one's family and I can certainly see the seeds of the idea. It's nowhere close to fully realized, and I doubt there's any edit of this film out there where it is, but it is a thematic undertone and not an uninteresting or bad one at that. It's one of the few times the film dares to border on anything resembling ambition.That really is the film's biggest problem. It had absolutely no ambition or vision beyond merely being a serviceable Horror film. There is nothing memorable or staying about this film and for an adaptation of one of the scariest and most staying books ever written, I can't think of a more egregious crime. Almost every single scare in the film is some form of jumpscare or fake-out scare. I might be able to forgive this if any of these had any kind of payoff, but they don't. This is the kind of Horror film that thinks a possessed person screaming, shaking and vibrating via terrible CGI like a Looney Toons character is scary. There's no Wendigo face in the woods or ominous return of Rachel or heart-wrenching sight of Gage's corpse. The gruesome detail and unsettling, personal trauma of the book are all gone, replaced by a generic, supernatural Horror film that's perfectly content doing absolutely nothing safe or new.Most of the cast isn't bad, but they aren't interesting either. John Lithgow is good in this film, but that's because he's John Lithgow. He's convincing in the role of Judd, but he doesn't bring anything to the role that any other great actor couldn't bring. He certainly doesn't capture the warmth and concern of Judd from the book. Amy Seimetz isn't bad, but again, she's not interesting either. Her Rachel is very much ""just there"", her only purpose seemingly to be to insert more stupid jump scares into the movie via her flashbacks with Zelda. She could have been written completely out of the movie and nothing would change (Well, maybe one thing, but we'll get to that later.)Jason Clarke...Oh man. I don't think Jason Clarke is a bad actor in the slightest, and he's even brilliant in a couple scenes here (All of his scenes mourning Ellie and the first couple scenes upon her resurrection being the most notable examples), but he's mostly terrible in this movie. His ""goofy dad"" act just comes off as awkward and forced. And you can forget about him having any kind of chemistry with his daughter or having any kind of emotional investment in their relationship. When his daughter briefly comes back to her normal self near the end, Louis doesn't even blink to hesitate trying to kill her.Which brings us to the movie's ending. Remember earlier when I said one thing would change if Rachel wasn't in the movie? That's because this movie ends with Rachel killing Louis and burying his body in the Pet Sematary, as the film ends on the cliffhanger that the 3 plan to do the same thing to little Gage to become a full zombie family. While this did come as a jolting surprise to me in the theater, being a vastly different ending to the book, I was more and more unsatisfied with it the more I thought about it. What was the narrative or thematic purpose? Did the film lead up to this in any way? Do the melodramatic and campy implications really lend themselves well to a film that's largely played straight? It felt like a cheap way for an otherwise deeply unmemorable and safe Horror movie to do something memorable at the last minute so people would think it was bold. It's emotionally manipulative and cheap and lazy and everything that shouldn't be associated with this story.I haven't been this disappointed by a movie in years. I am utterly shattered at how much Kevin Kölsch, Dennis Widmyer and Jeff Buhler botched this opportunity. The saddest thing is that who knows how long it will be until this film gets adapted again. Sometimes the book is better.",Pet Sematary
215,andymaranam,A very fine remake..,9,30 March 2019,"Sometimes i wish they would leave the originals alone & when i heard they were remaking pet cemetery..HOW? NOO! Then i remember how brilliant 'IT' was & too my satisfaction, They pulled it off again!..
This surprisingly, is a very stylish & well made horror flick that had me at the edge of my seat. The casting & acting is superb with some stylish backdrops, finally a well made horror for 2019 (im a dog person myself) that being said..A very good film & a well deserved 9/10",Pet Sematary
216,Svenstadt,"Not quite a schmooze-fest movie, more of a Hallmark or Lifetime short.",6,4 May 2019,"This was alright, not great. It is far from a horror film. It seemed a little too convenient at times, for the sake of moving the story, which I always notice. It is your typical bloody, gloomy horror type of film. It tried hard to be What Lies Beneath with Harrison Ford, but cannot replicate the same psychological, ""gotcha"" type of scary that that movie does. It has the typical wholesome familial cliches that most movies have. It does not appear that these people have much of a sort of spontaneous life outside of the plot, which I have already pointed out. Some scenes leave me scratching my head, like the part where the mother and daughter witness what must have been neighborhood kids (?) walking in a funeral-style procession to bury their animals in the pet sematary (?) We never see these town children again in the story and they are never mentioned again??? What's more, the doctor's family moves, for reasons that are not clearly established, although it is hinted that they wanted a slower life in a small town... Then later they learn from the neighbor that the pet sematary is inside their property line (deep in the woods), and they had no idea???",Pet Sematary
217,domtaylor,"The final act is good, but it can't save the utterly bland and fright-less set-up.",5,17 April 2019,"The first two-thirds of 'Pet Sematary' are purely set-up for the final act. There's no real tension or atmosphere created, and the forced attempts at 'horror' - which are completely un-affecting and almost laughably bad - are clearly only included so that the audience doesn't get bored. It's annoying how the filmmakers couldn't focus on delivering a solid narrative with engaging characters in these first two acts because they felt the need to keep the audience 'scared'. In lieu of a investing story about grief and loss, we have a pretty boring excuse for a set-up with a few jump-scares here and there. It really doesn't help that Jason Clarke is completely bland in the leading role and seems to be more bored than the audience, either. Saying that, none of the cast - bar John Lithgow, who is one of the saving graces of the first two-thirds - are really all that engaging. A lot of the dialogue is very awkwardly written, as well, which severely reduces the impact of some supposedly 'eerie' lines. It also doesn't help that the night-time scenes are very poorly lit, especially in the 'Pet Sematary', as this makes it even harder to be frightened by anything on screen. Luckily then, once things really get going (which unfortunately happens far too late into the narrative) it's quite enjoyable. It's never 'scary' but there's a good level of tension, you're actually invested and overall it becomes fairly entertaining. It's just a shame that the film's afraid to take its time in making the audience actually care and is more concerned with getting cheap jumps from them. The final act shows that the filmmakers can create tension and actually make things engaging, and luckily this section of the film exists. Without it, it would really be in trouble. Unfortunately, though, it isn't enough to make up for what comes before it, and therefore it's hard to recommend the film as a whole. 5/10",Pet Sematary

A family moves into country and discovers a pet cemetery. Beyond that is a burial ground that if you bury something they come back! But not as they once where.
After originally doing this with the family cat which came back. The dad played well by Jason Clarke takes his daughter to the burial ground after a tragic accident that he was originally shown by neighbour (the brilliant John Lithgow)
She does come back but not the same. The film seems predictable but the end is fairly original which I didn't see coming. Worth a watch.",Pet Sematary

221,tresm87,"This new updated adaptation is an intensely ominous vision of King's original story with brutal emotional depth, and some ambitiously interesting changes.",8,17 April 2019,"8.1/10 The original 1989 pet sematary film is a very solid film and captured King's book decently, but this new one gives it deeper emotional depth and endless unsettling atmosphere. There are some huge ambitious changes to the story that some purists are unaccepting of, though honestly work more effectively after you give it more thought. The plot follows mostly the same other than those altered aspects. However they didn't exactly go into some of the intricate details of the backstory/showing the burial ground/wendigo as well as they could've though it was touched on somewhat.Jason Clarke is completely dedicated to the role and carries the momentum well. Jete Lawrence gives an outstandingly delicate/devious dichotomy performance as well and will be a fantastic actress. John Lithgow was also very solid as the new Judd. The camerawork is flawless and builds the tension extremely. The wilderness settings/visuals where the sematary and ancient burial grounds are were portrayed spectacularly. They definitely had an eye for detail and created the set with passion in order to paint a picture of what source material imagined. The soundtrack was also fantastic in adding to the overall tone.Overall I think this film is suffering from more stubborn purists that are afraid to accept change, so they hate the film illogically. This is easily one of the most emotional horror's I've ever seen and has been way too slandered out of nostalgia.",Pet Sematary
222,CountVladDracula,Stick with the original.,1,7 April 2019,"The first warning sign that the Pet Semetary Remake isn't very good... When you learn Stephen King, himself, suggested a different ending from what they filmed... Seriously, they took a King classic and gave it an ending worthy of a crappy Zombie Apocalypse movie. This is not a ""reinterpretation."" This wasn't ""Changed for the modern audiences."" It was just a shameless cash grab and I hate that there are people defending it.Not to mention they changed which child died just for the sake of changing it to ""keep the audience on their toes.""",Pet Sematary
223,TerribleKatherine,"Better than I thought, worth watching",8,22 April 2019,"I just saw this one and I was pleasantly surprised. I am a huge King fan and I love both the novel and the original movie. The story is absolutely fascinating and Lambert's movie was the very first horror movie I saw at the age of eight. I didn't sleep for two weeks :) Lambert's movie isn't a masterpiece but it is still one of the scariest movies I have ever seen so it has it's well deserved place in horror genre.
Anyway, to keep this short I'll just list the things I liked and the things I didn't like. I liked the acting, it was solid the whole way through. I do have a soft spot for Jason Clarke and John Lithgow, they are such talented men. But yeah, they all did a great job, the children too. Some scenes were VERY well done and they creeped the c-rap out of me. The beginning scene and the major truck scene had an excellent sense of suspense and the imagery and music played well together.
Overall the story worked for me, but.. towards the end it got just a bit.. boring, I guess. I could see how they tried to out-run the original movie, but it just didn't land 100%. The last 5 minutes felt like they had to end the story quickly and I felt a mixture of emptiness and joy. I also wish that they had made the Zelda sideplot better, she wasn't portrayed as well as they could've.
Still, this movie was better than I anticipated and it had the right atmosphere for a King movie, so 8/10. With IT p.1 and Gerard's Game King adaptions are starting to look better and better!",Pet Sematary
224,BlueSkies765,Not for the faint of heart,10,9 May 2019,I usually like movies based on Stephen King bestellers so I thought this would be good. I didn´t read the book or watch the 1989 version so the story was fresh to me.I didn´t like the violent stuff as much as I liked the creepy concepts presented and the dark implications. What is left ambiguous leaves room for you to imagine the horrors.The way the movie was filmed and the rural environment gives it an unique style that I liked watching. There is also a lot of creativity with the regards to the topic of the movie so there was enough that kept me engaged.The last part of the movie seemed to go into a bad direction with things I felt were silly and didn´t fit the overall feel of the movie but in the very end it came back strong with a creative ending.Pet Sematary is a good horror movie. Not for the faint of heart.,Pet Sematary
225,angiris,"If you're gonna remake it, at least put in the effort. Jesus, Hollywood...",3,7 April 2019,"So I hate this. Just gonna get that straight.I went in objective, even as a mega fan of the original but I tried to admire and like it for its own merits.Problem is... the movie barely freaking has any original merits at all to enjoy.Pros:The film attempts to be creepy at times. 3-4 times.
The film makes the effort at trying something new such as having our dead individuals develop more of a character instead of just killing immediately.
Okay. Fair enough.
And... thats it.Cons:The film FAILS to be creepy 90 % of the time. It annoys you with cheap, predictable jumpscares that aren't even well done.
But to my greatest dismay it actually doesn't even TRY... to compete remotely with the original and some will praise it for that, I personally find this absolutely lazy and dumb.60 % of this film feels rushed. Everything that happens in the original, largely happens here BUT... it happens faster, without the atmosphere, and without fleshed out BELIEVABLE dialog with dark, tense music that tries to "" NOT SCARE YOU"".... but get under your skin.This is where I'll go off on a mini-rant about the video game franchise called F.E.A.R and how what happened to that franchise is a prime example of how NOT to bloody do horror. Although hollywood wont listen and I'm wasting my time trying to tell 'em but hey, it'll be therapeutic.F.E.A.R was a franchise built with 1 core concept from start to finish.
It wasn't horror, it wasn't blood, gore, dramatic story telling or emphasis on trauma or heroism.It was 1 thing. ""The idea... of getting under your skin""And thats why F.E.A.R 1 was such an amazing experience and absolutely legendary from the perspective of true horror. Because it never failed to creep you out with its visuals, its audio, its lore and the thought of ""something is watching me... something is out there, something isn't right, oh my god this is not a nice atmosphere""Pet Sematary, the original had many of the same aspects by making us of great dialog, superb line delivery, EMPHASIS ON PATIENCE... which helps improve the flow of dialog, making it more emotional, believable and impactful to the viewer.
In terms of cinematography this is what we call ""The build-up"" and we felt trauma, tension, sadness, sense of horrifying emotions running rampant throughout a broken family that came across as extremely relatable.When Gage died in the original, we heard screams, we saw blood, we saw a bloody shoe moving in slow motion as we heard screams of terror that'll rattle your very soul... it was horrifying to this very day.When Gage was brought back by his dad later on, we got a sweet scene with emotional, sad music playing as the father spent around a minute, sitting in the grave, holding his dead boy... holding him tight, missing him, and us the audience can feel it. We almost, if not definatively shed a tear because this is horrible to behold and its shot so well in terms of cinematography.The director and screenplay writers here knew exactly what to emphasize. Trauma, loss, relatability, terror, fear, tension, creepiness with a touch of desperation that we can all understand because losing our loved ones is the most terrible experience we will have in our lives.We had a few, but meaningful scenes with Pascow who was much more prevalent and likable in the original too. Bit of fun, sure but it worked out fine because it gave us that caspar the friendly ghost sense in the middle of a truly terrible story. Here, however he's barely in it. Alike everything else its just rush, rush rush !!! Jesus... why ?!What I think happened here is that the people who made this didn't even try to compete with the original and figured that they either couldn't or didn't bother fleshing out the story and characters from a TRULY emotional perspective so that we the audience can care and empathise with our protagonists because they figured it would be better to give time to silly jumpscares, worn down, not at all creepy sister and of course, more attacks and stuff near the end.Its not scary. Its not creepy. Its not at all effective means of horror. Because the dead... dont feel dead. They talk, they giggle, they move around quickly and apparently teleport 200 freaking yards inside of peoples houses because plot !Yes that actually happens. Lithgow (who did a great job btw) sees Ellie is alive, runs back to his house. after freaking 60 seconds of doing this he hears her upstairs. And tada... she's there! Zzzzzzz its so god damn boring. They didn't at all take the time to make her going there scary or creepy. Just her hiding and then jumpscare!
They made a small change with him kicking the bed unlike the original but whats the bloody point when he dies the same way anyway !... Jesus christ, modern hollywood. Pathetic...Once again. They try new things but dont at all try to do anything interesting with it. We barely see the burial grounds, we dont get any large shots of it at all. The Wendigo never appears either. Our dead mother and daughter die but dont at all look bloody or gory or such.The daughter was hit by a colossal god damn truck. Mashed! Barely any damage... give me a break. Again, something to add tension to how we react to her because she gets a lot of screentime near the end. Lots of talking, lots of threats and trying to be evil but it doesn't at all work.
It feels like a psycho kid that wants to murder its parents. NOT a zombie that is on a killing rampage.Wanna know why, Hollywood? Its because you didn't at all try to build it up using proper music, or proper visual design. Let alone watching how she moves, what she does.
Lots of the time she just vanishes off camera, goes all over the place and thats not creepy.They even have a scene where the dead cat goes to the basement right. Husband goes down, sees a dark doorway. I'm like "" Okay... something new here. Lets see. Is there something dead or unholy under the house? Alike Amityville Horror?""Nope. Of course not! Just a weird flashback thing of Pascow appearing for 4 freaking seconds telling him his life is about to go sideways. The end. He then gets knocked back outta the dark doorway and... thats it. We dont go further, we dont look inside if theres anything else there.NOTHING...at all is done with this. Its so incredibly poorly done. In the original we had Pascow appear at ideal times, depending on who he spoke to and what he wanted to pass on as a message. He even became this friend character we cared for and he cared for our main protagonist too.When his wife dies in the original and he carries her back to the burial grounds, Pascow appears, sad music plays and we know its terrible. We know its dreadful. He killed his own kid, it was horrible to behold how the father was crying inside and out, watching himself kill his child, necessarily because of the evil, only to give up on facts, and give into desperation, carrying his dead beloved back to try again... to no avail.Pascow appears, screaming:"" No, Lewis! ...No !! Nooo!!!""Impactful, meaningful, emotional, creepy and traumatic imagery. Superb usage of music and cinematography.What do we get here? Nothing. He runs up, daughter tries to be edgy and stabs the mother. Dad runs up, gets knocked over the head and wakes up only to run to the dark buriaul grounds which look like a tiny, little scene.This angers me really badly actually. We dont get 1 single freaking full shot of the burial grounds to get an idea of the surroundings and setting. Its just black... dark, shadowy, swamp like BLEH.... Jesus christ. When will you get it through your head, Hollywood. How are we supposed to be afraid of things when we cant see JACK!""sigh""I want to emphasize that at no point in this movie, except for the daughter, do we ever truly care about anyone in this film. And its because its rushed. Its too fast, they are skipping too much of the important bits from the original. Small chats, talks about the burial grounds.I'm trying really hard not to get extremely angry writing this next part... But they actually even included a freaking ""google "" search of the freaking local legends. Watching that was teeth grinding levels of "" Are...you... actually serious?""You got a guy that's lived across the house from you his ENTIRE life. In the original we got a story about his dog which they thankfully included, although quickly too and without flashbacks because again. Effort, ehh, Hollywood?But furthermore when the son died, they sat down, had a chat and the old man told a story about how a person had been brought back before. We got flashback tales about a terrible, twisted, creepy as hell guy that terroriized people and was eventually burned alive.Damn creepy. Excellent work on music and storytelling as well as acting.Here of course we get jack... because of course. Nah. Lets just skip the boring old guy and google stuff because modern age, ehh ?!
God I should've gotten drunk before writing this. Boiling these things down are making me far angrier than I thought.As I said to begin with. I'm a mega fan of Stephen King and the original movie.
It had heart, soul, emphasis on telling a very sad, very touching story that went terribly, terribly wrong... and built on that established concept with getting under our skin levels of darkness.Its an absolute horror masterpiece.THIS HERE HOWEVER... is a blatant, lazy, low effort piece of crap that copies the bare concepts of the original but doens't at all bother to flesh them out the same way.I am... MINDBLOWN by the fact that they actually thought this film could work this way. I mean sure, your averave pop-corn munching dude will watch this and be scared but christ... if you think a fan of true horror, let alone just the original movie will respect or like this you got another thing coming, Hollywood.If you're gonna remake a movie, then at least bloody TRY.
3 / 10. Tasteless, low effort, lazy crap.

Take a well-known tale, slap together a new version on a shoestring budget, create a poster and a trailer with the recognizable title in big red letters, and then sit back and watch as people go ""oh hey, I remember that"" and give you their money. At least IT had some effort put in. Pet Sematary is a lazy, passionless film devoid of nearly any creative energy. Its biggest sin isn't retreading tropes you've seen hundreds of times before, but the suffocating blandness in their execution. There's nothing here to suggest that anyone involved did anything more than show up to work every day to get paid.

229,Mike_Noga,Different but good,7,22 April 2019,"So this movie was different in some ways thn the original but I think it remained true to the spirit of the book.To be honest I like when remakes are different than the original, otherwise why remake them( except to cash in :( )I thought the relationship between Louis and his daughter Ellie was great. They really seemed like a loving father and daughter. Which is why when they switch it up and kill her off instead of the little boy, it hits so hardI thought the actress who played Ellie did a great job. She was convincing as the disarmingly sweet and earnest little Ellie and pretty damn creepy as an undead.Even though I marked this review as containing spoilers, there's one that I just can't give away.

230,TheGreatMarkukini,Should have left the book alone,3,12 April 2019,"Once again, I have made a rookie mistake of reading the book just before the release of the movie. It should be a rule not to jump into a beautiful creation of the author even before the announced ""masterpiece"" of horror, especially when the king of terror and provider of sleepless nights himself told that this is a scary one.I'll be damned if I say that the trailer hasn't scared me, so starting to watch the picture, I had sky high expectations, which were reducing by each second into the adaptation. I should have put a disclaimer from the beginning: if you loved the book (if you have read it of course you did) then everything will seem out of place. I completely understand that 500 pages cannot be squeezed into 2 hours of screen time with all the details, so the pace was picked up nicely and story was unraveling like a young jogger trying to overcome Usain Bolt's record. Although at the same time I felt moments of stagnation when time was stretching like grannie's pants and eternity gave you a high five.I need to salute the atmosphere that was one of the few chains holding me in my seat. The decorations were in place but the size and so called 'look and feel' was out of order - something was just not feeling right. The characters and even the dreadful backstory and the vibe that drives you nuts are not presented with intention to bring the horror from the deepest and darkest corner of your soul, they are plain and dry; just to be there.Snapping my jaw from a sweet long yawn I will admit that a few moments got me a little: the main scares come from screamers and disgusting stuff that you don't see every day. What I am expecting from the movies based on Stephen King's books is a constant presence of dread and the tension that keeps all your hairs up. It wasn't a case here, so I would recommend you to read the book and keep distance from this hideous attempt to recreate it.",Pet Sematary

When they announced this was happening I was very hesitant to get excited about it but after seeing it I can honestly say that it could've been a lot worse than it was. This is not a shot for shot remake of the original and it isn't a completely different film. The new scenes that it brings to the table vary in their strengths which is why I think some people love this film and others don't. Jason Clarke and Jonathan Lithgow were well cast and the highlights of the film for me. The newly added subplot with the wife felt completely unnecessary and forced but apart from that I had no complaints.",Pet Sematary
233,Benslie,A rollercoaster of a film,7,14 April 2019,"First of all, this film feels like three different movies all put together to make one movie and that isn't a good thing. The first part of this film was slow, the next part was intense and interesting and felt right, and the last part just took the film in a whole different direction. Now the first two parts I can understand being the way they are but I think the third part should've just been added to the second part. The editing in this film in some section was choppy and didn't transition properly. When there was an intense scene it would just cut to a happy go lucky scene. While in other cases it just didn't add up as if they wrote the script and didn't realize there was no proper transition between scenes. At least the film had beautiful shots to look at. All the cinematography and settings were stunning and you can tell that Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer, the directors of the movie, took their time to make sure that everything looked right in the shots. Now I have to talk about the acting and really all I can say is that it is better than the original movie but at the same time I think a few changes to the cast could have helped the movie out. Jason Clarke and John Lithgow, who plays Jud Crandall, probably were the best ones in the cast, well other than Lucas Lavoie who plays Gage Creed who was just cute. They brought the most out to help carry this movie and make it interesting. It is safe to say though that John Lithgow did a better job than Jason though. Towards the end, Jason just did a complete 360 with his character. In the end, Pet Sematary is a good with lots of flaws in it.

The acting is awful, the way the scenes are cut together makes no sense. It's not scary. The changes from the original story makes no sense and ruins the story.As Great as Fred Gwynne was as Jud in the original movie, as awful is John Lithgow playing the same character.Jason Clark couldn't give a decent performance if his very life depended on it.Dale Midkiff gave a great performance as Louis in the original. As did Denise Crosby as Rachel.The woman playing Rachel now is attractive but an awful actress.Victor Pascow is now a black guy and he is barely in the movie and the actor playing him is awfulThe whole Zelda bit was ruined here. Zelda is not scary and all of a sudden it's Rachel's fault that she died.The semetary and the burial ground is obviously a soundstage. Everything looks fake and too pretty. Church the cat is a complete cgi character. And it looks as fake as everything else. Where the original was shot outside on location in Maine. 5 minutes from Stephen Kings House. King even had a cameo in it and he wrote the screenplay. This crap was shot in Canada. And King had nothing to do with it. He should have stopped this movie from ever being made.The original is a true horror classic, very true to the book. The effects still hold up today and it's scary from start to finish. Great performances all around.In the remake they all become zombies at the end, except Gage. Yes it's that dumb.

It was the first novel, as a young man, that I read in one sitting. Every word of the book was captivating. Although Stephen King hated it, he published it from public demand. The book was a masterpiece.The first movie was brilliant and maybe the best Stephen King adaptation other than ""The Shining."" But this movie was utter crap. It showed no respect for the source material. It hurried along the plot at the price of character development. It completely ignored the point of the movie. The writer and director did NOT know why ""Pet Sematary"" was scary because all they did was rush the story and change a few things.It is an utter pile of crap.",Pet Sematary
239,iwatchibinge,Waste of time.,1,13 July 2019,"Nothing scary about it. Maximum initial time of the movie went into trying to potray cuteness of Ellie. Who moves into a house without surveying the background especially with acreages of woods in the backyard and trucks unnecessarily speeding right in front of homes? The first thing someone logical would have done is added a speedbump to slow down trucks near a home. And the whole storyline develops into just dying and rising, when the dead rise it ends - what kind of horror movie ends at that! Imagine, The Walking Dead ending 1st episode - dead rise end of story. I haven't seen old version of this movie for a long time, but think that was better.",Pet Sematary

243,WooderIce64,"Decent Movie, Bad Adaptation",5,27 October 2020,"As many of Stephen King's most popular adaptations get remade, Pet Sematary was a prime candidate. The product is decent - it doesn't rank high among adaptations of King's work, but at the same time not as bad as some of the worse movies. Among fans, however, it is hated, primarily for how much it differs from the book. Personally, I don't mind if an adaptation differs from the book, as long as it's a good movie in its own right. Take Kubrick's Shining for instance. It differs strongly from the book, but it's one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Pet Sematary, on the other hand, is just a mediocre horror movie.I never thought I'd say this about a Stephen King adaptation, but it's too short. Stephen King adaptations tend to be really long, like The Shining (2:36), The Shawshank Redemption (2:32), and even the remake of It (2:25). This is only 1:41. While that's a normal movie runtime, this story needs something longer, something in line with the other listed movies. Many of the ideas and plot points in this movie are not given enough time to develop. Some examples include Ellie's perception of death, Rachel's backstory, and everything with Victor. Some important things are all but ignored; the Wendigo is only mentioned once, toward the beginning.There is some stuff to like here. It's got a great sense of atmosphere and builds the environment quite well. They nailed Church. The acting isn't half bad, especially John Lithgow as Jud. Undead Ellie was done well from an acting and effects perspective, even if that's not how the book happened. It also gets the emotional moments right, which is something that separates this from other horror movies; it's more sad than scary.All in all, this movie feels unfinished. If it had an extra half hour to develop further, it would probably end up as a solid adaptation. As it is, it feels like the façade of Pet Sematary, complete and creepy on the outside, but mostly dead on the inside.",Pet Sematary

Pet Sematary just isn't very good, all around, in my opinion.They won't even call the Indian Burial Ground an Indian Burial Ground. That's how PC hellywood has become.And, again: this film is laughable. Zombie daughter doing ballet, breaking things? Brilliant idea, guys. We should definitely pay you millions to craft this.Even Jud is written terribly, here. No charm, like in the book or original film, and I'd argue that he's one of the best characters ever written in books, much less a Stephen King story.Skip this mess.

Yet all the elements are well-balanced. The alternate ending is even darker but frankly, it doesn't make much sense to me.The little girl plays so well in the movie.

247,eparazak,"Pet Sematary is a chilling and disturbing movie, despite having a bumpy beginning.",7,21 May 2019,"Pet Sematary is the latest adaptation of a Stephen King book, and a remake of the 1989 film of the same name. In it, a family moves to a fairly rural location, and discover a cemetery with supernatural abilities, which changes their lives entirely.I went into this movie blindly having never read the book or watched the original film. Regardless, I really enjoyed my time watching this. It gives the audience a horrifying take on what it would be like to return from the dead, and explores the potential consequences of playing god, in a supernatural way of course. The consequences have led to, what I think, are the most effectively disturbing scenes in the entire film. I thought the acting was very well done as well, with the performances from Jason Clarke and John Lithgow for example being great. The one that stood out to me the most, however was Jete Laurence as Ellie. I really enjoyed how well she portrayed the two sides of her character; describing how it worked out, however, would lead into spoiler territory, so check out the movie to see what I mean.I have two big problems with the movie, despite my praise for it. First off, it has its tendencies where it strays into some of the bad horror cliches, such as creepy music and excessive use of jump-scares. They really take away from my enjoyment of the film since they feel out of place when compared to the rest of the film, and are mainly used during scenes that honestly felt like pointless filler. Second of all, I thought the first act felt very slow. The world that we were supposed to immerse ourselves in felt like it was being built so slowly that I dozed off during some parts. I don't mind that the first act was all world building however. I just wish that it wasn't so slowly paced.Despite my complaints, I found Pet Sematary to be a richly chilling experience, and me and (most of) my friends had a good experience seeing the film.7/10",Pet Sematary

Even though it's based on a book by the legendary author Stephen King, it feels very unoriginal and something that i've seen before. As a person, who haven't read the book and know nothing about the story and without being hyped for it at all - at least i wanted to get a good and well made horror film that will be interesting and having something memorable, but it isn't what i receive and the film fails in many of the aspects of filmmaking by making it soulless as possible, without being special at all.",Pet Sematary
250,robinsonaustin-07490,An Empty Tomb,8,6 April 2019,"So, I had watched the original Pet Sematary, but I otherwise thought it was a cheesy film with some bad acting aside from Fred Gwynne who played Jud. The effects that were done at the time did not age well. So with 2019's Pet Sematary, I came into the film with little expectations, but it otherwise was a pretty good film.With the 2019 film adaptation of Stephen King's novel, I while I wouldn't call it the best film adaptation of King's works, one of the better things about the film is its acting. The acting was serviceable for the most part especially John Lithgow who played Jud in this version. In the original, I never understood why Jud told Louis about the Pet Sematary, but here, they give a more understandable motivation behind it, and his backstory here is genuinely sad. The child actors were also fine in this film with Ellie herself usurping the Gage from the original film in terms of scariness. However, the only downside to the acting is that it lacks that raw, emotional punch of the book and 1989 film. Granted in the original Dale Midkiff screaming ""NO!!"" in response to Gage's death was a little too silly and potentially ruins an otherwise traumatizing scene, the death of the child in this adaptation doesn't have the same poignancy.The film also felt kind of underwhelming. Not too long into the film, we get the cat getting killed and then afterward, we rush into the death of the child and the subsequent burial at the ""real cemetery."" While it did have moments of true dread, it was otherwise rift with jumpscares. As for the changes made from the novel, I didn't really mind that. Honestly, what would the point be of making another adaptation if it'd be the same as the plot of the movie?",Pet Sematary

256,helenbassett,Pet Sematary Film Review - Kevin Kölsch & Dennis Widmyer Direct The Night Of The Living Dead When Sometimes Dead Is Better,8,28 April 2019,"I didn't know the Stephen King story of Pet Sematary so watching it was a little horror treat directed by Kevin Kölsch & Dennis Widmyer. With a tight and well acted cast, and starring Jason Clarke as Louis Creed, a Boston doctor leaving behind the graveyard shifts of the ER for the local Maine University hospital. With wife Rachel played by Amy Seimetz, and children Ellie and Gage, they are looking for a quiet backwoods life with more space than they will unknowingly want to explore.And it all seems so perfect in Ludlow, the Estate Agent maybe forgetting to mention that a pet 'sematary' is located on their land, but it all seems harmless enough, with the local kids burying Fido and Lucky when it's their time. Or even earlier with the local Orinoco trucks that speed past the Creed's new home. John Lithgow their friendly neighbour Jud suggests to Rachel that the woods might be dangerous for Ellie to venture alone in, when he finds her exploring the cemetery. At bedtime discussing it Louis tells Jeté Laurence's Ellie that animals don't live as long as humans. But mummy's sister died young Ellie suggests, and we can see Rachel has never got over her sister's death. Both parents want to discuss death with eight year old Ellie who is now old enough to understand. But Louis's upfront bedside manner is completely different to Rachel's idea of death from Heaven's lovely view.And on his first day at wok Louis finds death himself comes calling when a young student is brought in after being hit by a car, and unable to save him Louis calls it, but is alarmed when Victor, played by Obssa Ahmed, then sits up and gives him a warning. From beyond the grave. That night Louis dreams of Victor and in it he follows him outside to the cemetery, with Victor saying he is trying to save Louis as Louis had tried to save him. Warning him not to go any further, as he starts to climb the wall of branches and wood at the back of the cemetery. And just as a hand reaches out to grab him, he wakes. We've all had that nightmare of 'Carrie', but when Louis pulls the sheets away in the morning his feet are muddy. It was no nightmare!And that Halloween Jud calls Louis over, Ellie's pet cat Church has been killed on the road. Wanting to shield her from the truth Louis and Jud take Church's lifeless body to bury in the pet sematary. But Jud knows how loved and special Church was to the Creeds, and takes Louis further into the woods, to a spiritual place revered by the local Indian tribe who had lived in the area a long time ago.Having buried Church, Louis and Rachel explain to Ellie that they think he ran away and Dad and Jud have been looking for him all night. He came back Ellie tells them, granted he looks a little mangier than before, and very matted, but large as life. Quite a surprise for Louis, but Church isn't like the docile cat he buried last night. Jud explains that animals return after being buried in the spiritual ground, but altered, but he thought that given how loved Church was, this time he would come back the same. But even Ellie doesn't want him in her bedroom. Clever of Stephen King to resurrect a cat given they are such spiritual animals. And can also be spiteful!Ellie is of course upset when Church does disappear, helped along the road by Louis!, and even her birthday party doesn't cheer her up. But wandering outside during the party, followed by Gage, she sees Church walking along, just as an Orinoco truck is thundering down the road towards him.The resulting tragedy encourages Louis, the matter-of-fact doctor, to break the barrier that Victor warned him against. Louis holds people's lives in his hands every day, but Jud warns him not to play God here. Sometimes dead is better. But grief is so strong. With plenty of eerie cemetery smoke and mist there was an unsettling feeling with Christopher Young's score, and jumps galore, nothing scary enough to make me want to peek though my fingers though. The sign of a truly scary movie for me. And in the quaint conversations about death and whether there is an afterlife, what if someone can tell us what it is really like? The characters are all suffering grief, and Pet Sematary will stick a knife and twist it until those long ago guilts return from Hell. To exact their revenge on the living.As to the ending I wondered where Victor, who has become a constant presence in the film, was. I thought he was protecting the family given that he was warning Louis. Whether he takes those warnings seriously is up to Louis, but why was he also present with other family members, unless he is there to protect ALL the family from the night of the living dead. If not then it was an even more gruesome zombie ending that Kevin Kölsch & Dennis Widmyer directed. And one to give a poor baby nightmares for the rest of his life!",Pet Sematary
257,pazu7,"""They don't come back the same""... they come back worse.",3,11 July 2019,"I was trying to think of a clever line to open with, but then I realized this film isn't worth the time. It isn't really worth the review but I wanted to throw in my 2 cents on King's books. They are actually about people, not monsters. The supernatual elements; the killer clowns, the vampires, the aliens, 'your #1 fan' or whatever.... they're always metphors for our fears and obstacles. King always spends more time on character developement than the supernatural elements. So, without well-drawn and engaging characters, the film adaptations just turn into B-movie schlock... which is basically what they've made here.. again. Think of every good King adaptation you've ever seen. Carrie. The Dead Zone. The Shining. Misery, Christine, Cujo, The most recent adaptaiton of IT. The one where the writer's sociopath character comes to life....? Can't remember the name off top of my head. That wasn't so bad. Even the TV miniseries of The Stand was better than this. What makes those adaptations work is the human drama. The people. Their fears and motivations. What they have to overcome to face the 'thing' ... whatever it winds up being. By the time the crazy stuff starts you're already engaged with the protagonist(s). But nothing in this tepid adaptation is emotionally engaging enough to create geuine suspence. It's just jump scares and gross-outs. The families emotional connection isn't realized enough to justify the father's desparate act, which brings the disaster. (no spoilers) It's just a plot point. ''This happens and then that happens and things go wrong and BOO!... lame. Fred Gwynne was the best thing about the original adaption. They didn't even have that here. Lithgow just phoned it in.

It wasn't boring at any point so that was good but there wasn't enough kills or gore like brightburn and i felt like the movie was going around in circles over and over a few times.

I must admit that when I was younger I didn't understand why Stephen King was considered a good author. I had never read his novels and I used to find films based on his books as boring. I think I just wanted a dumb scary movie with no meaning behind the story.Now almost 20 years later I can appreciate the Shining, It and this one. Oh my, I can't say enough how I enjoyed the story, the character development, the acting, the jump scares and the creepiness, but most of all I enjoyed the deeper meaning of the film which has to do with loss and how we humans tend to deal with it.It made think of Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein, which keeps reminding you to accept certain things that we cannot change. Resuscitating a man with half his face gone, keeping alive someone with a degenerative bone disease, or keeping a brain-dead patient on life support is usually for the selfishness of their family and friends on this Earth and won't make things better; it only keeps the poor patient supporting longer.Watch this film having this in mind and you'll enjoy it much beyond the mere scary atmosphere (which was excellent too, by the way).I'm a mom, a pet owner and I've dealt with loss too.

The depth of the characters aren't there like IT. A little more time spent on character development even if the movie was a bit longer.

That's the problem it should be a horror film but it's just not creepy at all. There is no atmosphere, no tension and no scenes were you are depressed afraid and is about to crap your pants when the dead comes back to life. In the book the theme death makes it really serious and real cause dying is something that's gonna happen to all of us at a point, and that is exactly why the book is so terrifying. But in the movie someone dies it just like watching a normal thriller and its very disappointing cause the director could have used the books power and made a masterpiece. I truly believe that if the people behind this movie could have put what made the book so great into the movie my score would probably been an eight or a nine rank.

270,daryopeek,"Eerie, but not impactful enough",6,18 April 2019,"After the success of It, it isn't that difficult to predict that older King's adapted works will be resurrecting. Pet Sematary comes with a new vision that feels darker than the 1989 version, but at the same time, somehow it doesn't work that well to surpass the first adaptation.Pet Sematary dealt with the grieving and encountering it, in horror perspective. The first half of the movie revolving on more dramatic scenes to make the audience engage more to the characters' actions, and the latter focusing on the horror part. The contrast between both is what object me to like the first adaptation. In my opinion, the differences in the climax scenes that prolonged feel more right to the plot's vein. It's grim and cold, but it's so natural.Those feelings could be translated well as work to understand death more if the drama scenes in the first part were playing well. Unlike the first movie that was showing warmth and togetherness of the family, the current version makes somehow a distance between the parents and the kids. For some reason, I feel like the parents' characters aren't too attached to their kids, even though it's the opposite.I like the climax in this movie, but they still can't justify the first part, so it's equally the same for me for this current and the first adaptation. Understanding the death is well translated in the first movie, but in this movie, they seem to be more keen to the darker idea (violence, exploring haunting sensation) that able to gives novelty and probably, more fit to the current generation - leaving the primary topic of the movie without any development.If this movie reduces the number of jumpscares and intensity in the first part, I'll like this movie more.

271,dhainline1,"The new ""Pet Sematary"" is a Frightening Gender Reversal Remake!",10,11 April 2019,"In 1983, Stephen King published ""Pet Sematary"" with great reluctance. The story even scared him to death! In 1989, it was made into a movie with him writing the screenplay and playing a minister. This story follows the Creed family of father Louis, mother Rachel, young daughter Ellie (Eileen in the novel, Ellen in 1989 and Eleanor in 2019) as they move into their new home in Ludlow, Maine. The Creeds want the relaxation of country life, but this being a Stephen King horror, that might be hard to get!
Jason Clark is great as Louis and so is Amy Steimetz as Rachel. Gage is played by twins while the awesome Jete Laurence plays Eleanor aka Ellie. Ellie is just a normal, run-of-the mile 8 soon to be 9 year old who loves her cat, Winston Churchill aka Church. She loves ballet and her new home in the country.
Ellie goes out to explore her new digs and finds the graveyard for pets with the sign of pet cemetery misspelled. There is also a deadfall to keep people out from the grounds beyond the cemetery. Ellie climbs it and is startled by her new neighbor, Judson Crandall (John Lithgow). He is a rather gruff sort but Ellie thaws him out.
What follows is one tragedy after another. A young African-American student at the college Louis doctors at dies on Louis' watch. Victor Pascow, the student Louis tried to save visits him as a ghost in order to warn Louis not to go over the deadfall. Rachel keeps remembering her fatally ill sister, Zelda who died when they were children. Rachel blames herself for Delta's death in the dumbwaiter. Church is killed by a car on Halloween and Rachel tells Louis not to tell Ellie about the death.
Jud wants to help Louis with Church and he takes him beyond the deadfall to the burial grounds of the Micmac tribe. Louis buries Church in the grounds and goes home. As in all 3 sources, Church comes back and is mean as hell! He scratches Ellie and the final straw is when he almost attacks Gage in the crib. Louis almost puts the cat to sleep but Church seems like his old self. Louis lets him go and tells Ellie her cat ran away.
Jud tells Louis that the burial grounds is evil and anything buried there will turn bad as well. One wishes Louis took that advice to heart! The next one to die is Ellie who is killed by a truck on her 9th birthday. This is the gender switch because Ellie a girl dies instead of Gage a boy. Louis sends his wife and son to her parents in Boston. He drugs Jud's drink and digs up his daughter. He buries her in the cursed ground.
Jete Laurence is absolutely wonderful as the good Ellie and the evil, undead zombie Ellie! In the end, all the Creeds become zombies and they are like the Cullen family of ""Twilight"" but are zombies not vampires. I do wish for a sequel, but maybe a prequel is better. In many ways, this movie is better than the 30-year-old treatment and I thought this gender reversal worked! I thought Ellie was more scarier than Gage!",Pet Sematary
272,tranat71,"This movie is a lot better than most movies I've seen, great Dolby ATMOS overhead sound effects",10,22 October 2019,"This movie is worth checking out for yourself. Don't just believe the poor ratings and reviews.I think Pet Sematary 2019 (PS-2019) is better than most movies I've seen - I'll name just a few - Black Panther, all Star Wars movies after Ep. 4,5,6, all Avengers movies, 90% of all comic-book movies (both Marvel and D/C).Obviously, PS-2019 isn't among the best movies (Godfather movies, Shawshank, Dark Knight movies - pretty much Christopher Nolan movies). But, again, I think it is better than most movies out there.So don't take my word or anyone's word for it. See it for yourself.In terms of Dolby Atmos soundtrack, it doesn't have active overhead sound effects all the time, but when it does have them, it will give you goosebumps. The scenes where the sick sister is moving upstairs or when the little girl is moving around upstairs, the Atmos ceiling sound effects is CREEPY as hell. Definitely worth checking out on 4K/Atmos BluRay if you have a great Dolby Atmos home theater system.",Pet Sematary
273,gluonpaul,If it wasnt a remake I think it would have better scores,8,6 April 2019,"So this movie calls itself Pet Sematary and looks to be a remake of sorts, based on a book by Stephen King but in truth it doesnt follow that story line very much. It has a pet cemetery in it, thats about all that links it to the book or previous film.In all honesty as a standalone story it was actually pretty good. Not perfect, there wasnt enough time given to the development of the friendship with the neighbour to feel natural but they were trying to fit it all in so thats forgivable.The actors all did a good job, including the child, and there were some quite scary elements to the story. Unfortunately one of those was spoilt in the trailer for the film but even so, I would just recommend try to avoid the trailer if you can.Definitely worth a watch I would say. It was a movie which looks to entertain and scare you, not try to feed you any political story which itself makes it a big positive in this age of cinema. It seems now its not often you can see a movie at the cinema which isnt looking to force a political view on you.",Pet Sematary

275,nathanjamesemerson,Another great film adaption,9,6 April 2019,"Just to clarify this right off the bat. This movie is NOT a remake. It is another film adaption based on the 1983 novel by the master of horror, Stephen King. I get sick and tired of people saying 'another useless remake' etc etc. But this film is not. The same as with IT : Chapter One from 2017.Now that is out of the way....Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz are amazing in there roles of Louis and Rachel Creed. And Jete Laurence who plays there young daughter Ellie also puts on an amazing performance for someone at her young age. John Lithgow also stars and nothing needs to be said about him, as he is great in everything.It's a shame the morons behind the marketing spoiled one of the biggest changes in the movie trailers. Whoever gave them the go ahead to release such a spoiler filled trailer should be fired. The movie is set up perfectly to have that come as a major suprise, and it would have been if the idiots didn't spoil it. If I were the directors I would have been furious.And speaking of changes, the changes do work in the film. If you are a fan of the novel or of the first adaption from 1989, don't go in expecting it to be the similar to either.The film is bleak and dark which of course is what the subject matter is about. Life, love and death are the themes. The film has some jump scares but nothing too jarring or constant. The film is not too graphic, as what others will lead you to believe.I really enjoyed this film. I still prefer the first film adaption a little bit more as I have watched it probably around 100 times since it came out in 1989. But I assure you, I will be watching this adaption many many more times over the years and I can't wait to buy it on both DVD and Blu Ray",Pet Sematary
276,rustonreviews,Haunting and bleak.,7,12 April 2019,"Of all the novels Stephen King has written across his lengthy career, the master of horror always cites his 1983 horror classic Pet Sematary to be the one to have ""genuinely scared him the most"" whilst writing it. If you've read the book, or seen Mary Lambert's 1989 adaptation, you'll likely find no doubt in King's statement, because Pet Sematary is certainly grim, but it remains one of King's most notable horror tales, and for good reason. With the announcement of an updated adaptation of King's novel, I had mixed opinions. Lambert's 1989 original (with a screenplay written by King) still holds up pretty well by todays standards, and even though the film was panned upon its release, it has since garnered a dedicated cult following.Given the enormous success of 2017's It, it was inevitable that many more reimagining's of King's other classics would follow. In Pet Sematary, Dr. Louis Creed (Clarke) and his wife Rachel (Seimetz), along with their young daughter and son, leave Boston behind them and relocate to Maine to begin anew. Louis swiftly befriends local Judd (Lithgow), who has undesired knowledge of the sinister secrets of Pet Sematary's ritualistic grounds. When their cat Church is suddenly killed, Judd suggests burying it in the Pet Sematary. To Louis' surprise, Church returns the next morning, but is eerily changed. A family tragedy strikes shortly after Church's unexpected return, and it is one that will push Louis to his darkest limits.This King reimagining is certainly a grim journey into the depths of despairing darkness, and Buhler's screenplay honours both King's novel and Lambert's film while making several minor changes to avoid becoming nothing more than a stale retelling of a classic. One of Pet Sematary's strongest factors is the total absence of humour. There are no attempts to ever lighten the mood with cheap throwaway gags, because the filmmakers understand exactly what tone is required, and they nail it. The world in which Pet Sematary takes place is bleak and hopeless, and reeks of decay and death. Some of the creepiest scenes in the film are flashbacks featuring Zelda, Rachel's ailing sister, who suffers from spinal meningitis. These merely serve as a minor subplot to the overall story, and don't take up too much screen time at all, but there is one sequence in particular that is a horrifying standout. John Lithgow as Judd was an excellent casting choice as well. Jump scares are at a minimum too, as atmosphere and the unnerving sense of impending dread take centre stage instead.Pet Sematary is another solid King reimagining, although it wasn't necessarily an urgent requirement for it to have received the remake treatment. Nevertheless, it's still an enjoyable horror film that takes itself and the source material seriously, and will no doubt please both fans of the novel and original film. At its core, Pet Sematary is a meditation on grief and loss, and the morbid curiosities of what happens after we die. It is a bleak, gloomy ride throughout, and is worth checking out, whether you know the story inside out or not at all.",Pet Sematary

279,sanjidparvez,Highly disappointing,4,7 April 2019,"Almost nothing worked in this very disappointing effort of an remake. The bonding between Jud & Louise was hilariously rushed, particularly when he told him about the ancient burial ground for the very first time, ""Ellie loved Church and you love your daughter, so come with me..."". Though I can't exactly recall the dialogue but yes...it was almost this much lame. And not only between Jud & Louise, the emotional attachment between the other characters also didn't work effectively most of the time. The character switch regarding the death of a child horribly failed. Gage was almost missing throughout the movie and personality I think they still could have worked with this kid as he almost looked & at times acted like 1989 Gage in whatever little amount of screentime they put him through in this film. The treatment for resurrected Ellie was so poorly done that they made her well aware of what actually happened to her & she started to acting like more of an evil child rather than a resurrected child possessed by something otherworldly evil or a demonic entity and the movie just completely lost me there.
So needless to say, they failed to explore the whole idea of understanding DEATH & its lasting effects in an emotionally wounded family. The sudden horn from the trucks played a major role in the jump scares which they delivered routinely but didn't work so well either.
Last but not the least, the take on the ancient burial ground looked like a stage set with heavy fog all over the place. It was quite cheap like a B-grade horror flick as there was no long distance shot of of the whole ground where you can get an idea about that mysterious & spooky place, while the original film captured it much better even in the broad daylight.Expected more from the director duo of STARRY EYES (2014) which was a pretty decent film with an interesting original idea but this time it felt like they just did a hired job on request by the studio, not wasting much efforts of their own for this film.If you are planning to give it a watch at the theater, then take my advice and save your valued ticket money for something big like ""Avengers: Endgame"" or ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"". For the sake of being a Stephen King fan, wait for its online streaming or TV release instead.",Pet Sematary

I just didn't find it very good.They cut too much of the original book out of it leaving only vague references to things in the book. Victor Pascow was a minor one off appearance here for the most part. Judd and Louis' friendship was kind of non existent. John Lithgow is a better actor than this so you can tell the script was just not there. Jason Clarke as Louis seemed stilted but again this seems to be the script. There isn't much in the way of overall character development or backstory. I feel John Lithgow was a completely wasted talent here given what Judd could have been written like.Having Gage live and Ellie die instead didn't really do anything for the story because they didn't delve into much of the back story of the Pet Sematary to begin with. Judd gives a very brief explanation. Church provided similar jump scares to the original so the cat did it's job.It strays further from the original story whereas the original was closer but not perfect.It feels lower budget than it is. The sets look cheap. The atmosphere is average at best.As a stand-alone movie it's a higher 4 a lower 5 or somewhere in between mainly because it isn't unwatchable.

291,pedroquintaoo,Just the typical remake that doesn't change anything,5,5 April 2019,"The new Pet Sematary has good points that try to make it a nice movie, however there are a lot of bad decisions that make it just an average film.The character development of the family member who dies is carefully designed to create a emotional connection with the viewer, while Pet Sematary (1989) failed in this context, but won with distinction throughout the story of Rachel's past. In the original, this sub-plot offers one of the most bizarre and scariest scenes ever. The new version fails terribly in that aspect, delivering us something more stylized and less scary.
The plot tries to respect the mythology of the source material, but doesn't go very far. I presume that Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer tried their best as filmmakers, but the studio's intervention made this remake being just mediocre.The first part has some moments of tension, tries to explore the relationships between characters and creates a connection with the viewer. It may not please the public that is waiting for a festival of scares, but in my opinion was a fantastic decision. The second part gives us a totally different tone, becoming just a weak slasher with supernatural elements. All the development built around the characters is thrown into the trash, in exchange for free jump scares and moments designed to please the main public. I felt disgusted to see such a good movie losing its entire course. If initially, the whole theme about the loss of our loved ones reminds me the excellent Hereditary (2018), it quickly becomes a kind of failure like The Nun (2018).What about the violence, is it very violent? No, I don't even know why it was rated Rated R in the US. All the violence presented is weak (except in one scene) and all the bloody elements have been added digitally. Speaking about deaths, another negative point I hated was the main death. It took about an hour to develop the characters, making me wait for something dramatic, disturbing and shocking like the scene of the car crash in Hereditary (2018).Talking about the performances, I start by saying that I'm not a big fan of Jason Clarke, however I enjoyed to watch him in a role infinitely superior than Dale Midkiff in the original movie. Amy Seimetz performs well, but I think she should have more scenes to demonstrate her character's potential. Last but not least, I have to mention the performance of the little Jeté Laurence, who plays Creed's daughter and gives her heart and soul to her role (I hope Hollywood keeps an eye on this prodigy).From a technical perspective, Christopher Young was responsible for giving us a totally immersive soundtrack. In the field of cinematography, I have an enormous criticism to make. The light was too dark, even in the daytime scenes. I don't know if was a technical problem that wasn't resolved in post-production or if it was the movie theater's fault. I think was probably the worst light job I saw in a ""medium-budget"" movie.It's a remake that tries to have some identity, but at the same time lives too much in the shadow of the original. It's ideal for the same type of public that enjoys productions like Annabelle (2014) or Paranormal Activity (2007). It might have been better if they had kept the initial course and tried to do something more disturbing. Maybe in 20 or 30 years we will have a good remake, but just if we won't be all buried in a ""sematary"" due to the consequences of global warming.Rating: 5.5/10",Pet Sematary

The thing about King stories, for the most part is that they are dramas with horror elements. This however is a straight up dumb horror movie, in league with Annabelle and all those other schlock horror movies. It hits all the beats that those movies do: cheap jump scares, gross-out possession body horror, characters walking into certain danger etc. The filmmakers just weren't interested with setting up the characters and concentrating on the grief and tragedy in a way that would make the audience feel emotional. Instead they opted for cheap thrills as the movies just moves from one cheap scare scene to the next, not slowing down to have any moments of character building. The book left me emotionally drained whilst the movie made me feel nothing. Towards the end it became so dumb that I kind of went with it and enjoyed it as I had a few moments when I just wanted to laugh out loud at the stupidity of the movie and the characters.

This version of King's novel is so much better than the original, that it's difficult to complain about the new emphasis on the wife's character, which I think is an added touch - and may actually be a good thing, since it suggests the seeds of the horror have been planted years before the script begins - at least for her.

Perhaps it was the locations (NOT filmed in Maine - there is no substitute for actually filming in Bangor and surrounding areas like the original '89 version did). Somehow the atmosphere just didn't feel right. I sadly wasn't emotionally attached to the characters (the acting ranged from fine to great in some scenes - not the fault of the actors that the film wasn't better). To be fair, it would have been hard to meet my expectations, but when you truly do a remake, expectations ARE going to be very high.In hindsight, I think the production would have been much better suited to either A) a sequel, B) a prequel, or C) a mini-series (a-la ""Haunting of Hill House"" / ""Castle Rock"" / etc.).

I admit that I did not master the viewing in one go, I had to finish it the next day. The movie was a bit boring. I don't even want to compare it with the 1989 film adaptation. These are two very different readings. However, there were also scenes when the feeling of fear was aggravated, but not so much from horror as from a mystical mood. The scene where the daughter returned from the cemetery and began to perform a dance in the room, throwing and smashing all the objects around, was especially shocking. At the same time, the behavior of parents, in particular, the father, does not look very natural. From a realist doctor and a skeptic, he instantly turns into a wild desire to resurrect his dead daughter at all costs. What about grandpa? He behaved quite unwisely from the very beginning, although, it would seem, with years and previous experience, he should have been clear in advance... if you put the shortcomings in a few words, then perhaps the main thing for this genre of cinema was missing - dynamics and emotionality. Or was it just me who thought that the actors were just playing it over in some places?...However, this is a remake, which is just interesting to compare with the first film. No more than. The plot set by the Director could not be carried away. I recall by analogy the example of the remake of ""It"" - here, after all, the creators tried to make sure that all fans are looking forward to the release of the second part of it.

All of the actors were good and its based on a Stephen King novel so yes there is quality in it but I still couldn't mark it higher than a six but this might be because I was expecting more. Was it scary? I guess if you have smoked a joint and am alone watching it in the early hours you might feel a bit uneasy, I'd say it had a couple of eerie moments but not scary.
Like I said, I dont know if its over-rated, One thing I am sure about is that throughout the the film I felt quite sorry for the cat, who seemed very friendly but very roughed up while not knowing wtf was going on",Pet Sematary

We decided, as a family, to watch the original film and the following evening, this new version. I am so glad we did! I think that sometimes people can have clouded judgements based on nostalgia and how the original shouldn't be tampered with.
This remake is really good and SO MUCH better than the original; better acting by all the characters, better effects (no doll-like figure leaping from a cupboard), and the story was more coherent. Don't be put off by the low rating and give this film the chance it deserves!",Pet Sematary

It manages to build good moments of tension, the performances are a thousand times better than the ones from the original one, in that they were very mediocre. The film was excellent (I would put a note of 9) but in the final act it deflates and goes to the trash.

Despite it not being as challenging as it should be, it is much better acted, grounded and coherent than the first film adaptation of King's acclaimed novel. It is spooky, melancholic, eerie, well-shot with solid performances. There's quality ingredients but they came served in a teacup when the audience wanted a full plate.Genre filmmakers in recent years are taking big risks which have brought a new wave of horror culture that intrigues and challenges audiences and unfortunately Pet Sematary watched the wave pass by and kept their eyes on the conventional horror-by-number formula that recalls the remake parade of 2004 thru 2009.Solid, but stoic.",Pet Sematary

The original, you felt for all the characters except Rachael but she's just an unlikeable character regardless. There were a few things I liked, they brought up the Wendigo and I didn't mind the change of Gage to Ellie but at the same time, it didn't help the story at all. I like John Lithgow but his Jud was crap compared to Fred Gwynne. Won't be watching again, I'll stick to the original. I gave it 3 stars mainly for the girl who played Ellie, she was very good in her role and was the only thing I liked and I liked that Rachael had a bigger role and had some brains.

Classics should not be touched for a quick money grab. This movie possesses none of the suspense the original has in abundance. The rage and anger with death is not brought home in this piece. With the original, you are able to feel the frustration with being unable to control your own mortality. It's not forced! The ending in the original, is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie I have ever viewed. I can say, as far as supernatural horror is concerned, the original is one to forever be cherished. I wasn't scared or made to feel nervous once. I barely even connected with any of the characters, It's not due to the acting being bad, it's solid to say the least; it has more to do with blatant discussions of life and death. One of the most horrific aspect of the remake that's present in the first is Gage, he is a huge component of why the original is frightening.",Pet Sematary

Everybody acts well, the cinematography is very good, and I am glad they don't rely on darkness to build suspense. That's right, this is a good, well-lit horror movie.However, they chose to focus too much on scenes that no one remembers about the book or the original. I certainly don't remember the mother's backstory, and for good reason. It is not all that interesting. These are the weakest scenes in the movie, when they pull away from what is CURRENTLY going down in the house to spend time in the mother's dreams and hallucinations just so that they can fit those extra jumpscares in. They had the opportunity to make her fear of death relevant in the current story, but they missed it.If those scenes were cut short, we would have more time for the second act of the film: the father and the family adjusting to the 'returned' child. This is the part that should have been drawn out the longest, but in my opinion it was over all too fast. While the cat had a very gradual or subtle shift into dead mode, El snaps after one interaction. I love how everything plays out and everyone's performances, but I would have loved one more hour of it with the proper build-up.",Pet Sematary

The original is not exactly any better but at least that one was original, why on earth Hollywood can not stop remaking movies is beyond me they all just destroy the originals.

329,DJKwa,"Sometimes, dead is better.",6,26 March 2019,"Stephen King is well known for mining the macabre for scenes of sheer terror while also finding moments of dark comedy to alleviate the tension. Walking into Pet Sematary, I wasn't expecting the opposite. Admittedly, having not read the source material or seen the original film, my impression was formed simply from the trailers which sold a dark, foreboding take on bringing the dead back to life.I can report that Pet Sematary is best viewed as a dark comedy. With a threadbare story, most of which is already crammed into the film's second trailer (avoid it if you can), the film is not interested in offering any depth to its horror, instead relying on the audience to get on board with the idea of reanimated corpses at face value and it leads to some pretty silly, but still highly entertaining, moments.That's not to say that the film doesn't play it completely straight. The acting across the board is strong, in particular Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz who convincingly play the part of grieving parents, and the atmosphere is effectively cold and unsettling. The scares on the other hand are fairly basic. Remember the truck jump scare in the trailer? Well get ready to see it used numerous times throughout the film. Also, it would make for a pretty short drinking game ticking off all of the horror tropes covered over the film's runtime. Creepy looking kids? Check. Loud noises at night? Check. Events set during Halloween? Check. It's familiar stuff but delivered in a consummate manner so it would be a lie to say that they don't still provide a kick.The film doesn't want you to think, it just wants you to react, and with the right audience it's definitely a riot. Along with an ending that basically winks at the audience, Pet Sematary is pulpy fun but don't go expecting any genuine terror.",Pet Sematary
330,bogdanbalostin,Cute and thrilling but nothing spectacular,6,28 September 2019,"Yes, I used cute to describe this movie. There is no sense of horror in this movie and maybe a little bit of strong grief at one of the death scenes. But that's it.I don't mind that they changed the character's fate from the book. I honestly thought it would work better like this for the film version but the main sin of the movie is it just doesn't even try to make us connected to the characters.And what's with the wife's backstory? Doesn't make any sense and it doesn't help with her character development at all. Waste of time, in my opinion.The movie is thrilling enough to keep you watching until the end, but if you've read the book, you know how strong emotions this story should get from you. And there's none of that here.",Pet Sematary

OUCH).Overall, it's not gonna win any awards and there are certainly some parts which were too generic for me, but you won't feel like you've wasted your time.

Despite a few changes from the original source, everything remains the same, however, the screenplay doesn't take you to the fear zone, and the story develops a rather flat, boring story. Maybe the actors weren't good, but definetely, the director should have modify the way the story goes, cause there are pointless scenes and you will fall asleep before you get some real action. Photography could have been more original, and also the music. I think the main problem with this movie is that everything in it is just generic.",Pet Sematary

Its generally freaky. The new one has none of that. I felt it was just a quick cash in of Stephen Kings material. I could not find a thing I liked about it. The original had a firm grip on the deal of death and the loss of a loved one. It felt much more powerful and real than this this film. This film seemed to lack the emotion the original had.

346,Kolobos51,A lousy remake I would just as soon have skipped.,4,21 April 2019,"I love the original Pet Sematary. It has aged poorly but once you get past the fact that it almost looks like a TV movie by today's standards, it's a fantastic Greek tragedy brought to (relative) modern times by Stephen King's phenomenal script and Mary Harron's edgy, envelope pushing direction.This movie however had plenty of promise, with a solid cast, interesting directors (the guys that made Starry Eyes), and great source material, and. honestly, I was shocked by how bad it is. The editing is horrible and the script is lousy, and the movie fails to hold together AT ALL. It's silly, it's not involving, and the only people I think should watch this are teenagers with 10 second attention spans that need a jolt in every scene to stay interested.John Lithgow as Judd, the friendly and knowledgeable neighbor, is not given enough to do. Jason Clarke is underdeveloped as Louis Creed and his actions seem obligatory rather than natural. And so does this movie.The thing is that when this movie follows the original story, it feels like bullet points, a necessary series of ""well this is supposed to happen"" moments. Then, when it deviates from the original, it seems silly and forced. And don't even get me started on how terrible the ending is. I really can't recommend this to anyone except die hard fans of the cast and kids that don't care and just want some cheap thrills. And there are some legitimate fear moments. But not many. I disliked this movie more than I ever thought I would and would place it towards the bottom of the heap as far as horror remakes go. This is just not a good movie.Watch the original.

351,mulcahyj-07545,A poor remake of a decent film of an excellent novel.,3,9 February 2020,"The source for this film, the Stephen King book, is an incredibly emotionally intense story that manages to make an extremely unlikely premise believable. It was always going to be unlikely to make a good movie though Mary Lambert did a pretty good job in 1989 to the extent I have I watched it more than once. Who can forget Fred Gwynne's performance!As it is such hard to transfer to a believable film I was surprised it was remade. I shouldn't be as so many movies are these days. I dont use the iditotic description of these movies as reboots. Sometimes they are done quite successfully. More common are disasters. I was tempted to watch Psycho just for its scene for scene remake just for ludicrous comedy value. This attempt is not a disaster. Just feels like a poor B movie straight to DVD or ill funded cable channel time filler. Very inferior to original adaptation.
The film itself seems to be very rushed. Poorly scripted. It tries some changes to give it a new feel. Some of which are interesting. Others bordering on amatuerish. It is had to gauge the actors performances especially with some of the dialogue they had to spout which they must have been tempted to refuse or change themselves. The sudden exchanges between a couple married for years that the wifes details of her childhood sister's death were incredibly badly scripted. And the husbands sudden relevation to the wife that he didn't believe in life after death was laughable. Did this married couple just meet and have never talked to each other on their views and beliefs?
If you have never read the Stephen King book, seen the 1989 adaption and dont mind below class b movies this may pass some time for you. That is the best recommendation I can give.
If John Lithgow just had a 10 second cameo in which he walked past the camera, stopped to give a quick wave and walked off screen he still would have been the best thing in this. He must have been giving his lines in this through gritted teeth in anger.

352,zanghi_james,Not a Half-Bad Horror Movie.,8,5 November 2019,"I love reading Stephen King. I have not found a copy of Pet Sematary, but I knew how the story went from reading a summary on Wikipedia. As usual, I got this film out and watched it before reading the book, so I can't compare it to King's novel. Also, I haven't watched the previous two films based on the novel, so I can't compare them to this, either.As a stand-alone horror film, this film is pretty nice. The modern setting isn't heavily utilized, so there isn't a ton of Social Media stuff featured in the film, unlike a lot of the Blumhouse films I have seen like Truth or Dare. There isn't a really huge cast, so the film is more intimate and you get to understand the characters a little more. John Lithgow is great (and I loved the reference to the Crown and his performance as Winston Churchill in this film.) and Jason Clarke plays a good dad. The girl who plays Ellie definitely should walk away with some sort of Horror-equivalent of an Oscar for her performance, though. Also, I though the special effects were much better than most of the horror films I have seen recently, including a couple of Conjuring films.This is a nice Stephen King adaptation. It's nothing too spectacular, it's not The Shining or 1408 or The Mist or IT, but I recommend watching it if you want a nice spooky thrill-ride.May the Force be with you!",Pet Sematary

You'd think a doctor would handle the horrifically wounded and corpses well, not this one, he goes full PTSD fast.Anyway the second half of the movie is where the fun begins, things start to move differently from the normal horror plot lines and it add some weight to the characters motivation but in the end it fall flat.3/10. watch it with your horror loving girlfriend.",Pet Sematary

The little girl I have to say does a marvellous job. As always John Lithgow is great. He is Judd. I found both parents poor though.

Instead of being about how we do (or do not) deal with death, trauma, and loss, the 2019 film focuses on the difficulty of achieving an ideal family situation in the face of modern life. Also prominently featured is the evil wendigo, which lives in the woods - an aspect of King's novel that is barely hinted at in the earlier film. Fans may or may not appreciate several nods and fakeouts that reference the other movie, as well as changes to the story, which allow for some disturbing new scenes and sinister surprises in what might be an otherwise familiar story.

I felt like I was watching a movie from the 90's. Peharps that was intentional, the idea was creating a 90's atmosphere. Can't say much about the movie itself, but it's sorta an alternate universe (spoilers ahead!!!!!) because the boy Gage won't die as in the original movie. The main character saves his son in the last moment. Instead, his older daughter dies and she's going to come back to thanks daddy to turning her in an evil rotting killer zombie girl from hell.
Should not have made this remake. Pet Sematery is good the way it is. I mean... IT remake is awesome, wont reach the essence of the original, but it's a cool remake.
Pet Sematery... not so good.",Pet Sematary
360,ikizdevran-882-254684,Sometimes Dead is Indeed Better,6,17 April 2019,"Even tough I have read quite a lot of books from Stephen King, Pet Sematary isn't one of them. At least for now. Therefore, I will strictly write this review based on what happens in the movie because I tend to be very harsh when it comes to the movies based on the books I have read. Compared to the 1989 version of the movie with the same name, this one is quite different and some scary elements have been added in the story and I am pretty sure these elements don't exist in the book either. Story wise, Pet Sematary is quite unique and powerful but either because of the director or something else, no one manages to master this exceptional horror story. It always feels underrated and unappreciated. A story like this could have been turned into a great show with necessary elements but the directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer fail to bring those elements together. First of all, the story itself is quite creepy that's why there shouldn't be any scene where directors try to scare you with stupid screams or sound or things that happen too suddenly in the dark. Scaring with sound is a well-known element in horror movies with that story that has nothing to give to the audience. Pet Sematary, story wise, isn't one of them but it seems like the directors do not believe in their own movie. Atmosphere was dark enough to give you chills and it was absolutely necessary for the movie's credibility. Acting was fine but nothing exceptional. What I found quite illogical was the decisions of those characters in the movie. They are presented us to be smart people but they took every wrong decision possible. Pet Sematary also shows us that sometimes dead is indeed better, much better. After I got out of the cinema saloon, I understand the value of letting go. Sometimes you just need to let go because when you are trying to save something very little you may destroy everything else around you. It was pretty sad to witness the destruction of such a nice family. As I have written above, with a little bit of touch, this story could have been turned into a masterpiece, but as the way it is, Pet Sematary is still watchable and enjoyable.",Pet Sematary
361,TheJohnnyPHreak,A Remake/Re imagining That Is A Let Down,2,24 April 2019,"Stop. Please Hollywood, just stop making Stephen King books into movies. Because seriously, you all just don't get what makes his books so great, so terrifying and so engrossing. It hasn't translated on screen very well. IT is the exception. (I love the film so much) But I'm very worried after seeing this remake/reimaging of Pet Sematary, that the IT Chapter 2 might fall short. (I really hope it doesn't because I'm rooting for it) I had high hopes for Pet Sematary. I liked the cast, the filmmakers seemed to be going more by the book than just the film. The first trailer was pretty good. I had excitement for this film. I didn't even mind when the second trailer dropped and the big mid-story twist had been changed. I was like they are going by the book but in their own way. I can get on board with it. Even the reviews out of SXSW were positive. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. Pet Sematary is bad, really bad.I'll spill the plot short. The Creeds are a family relocating from Boston to Maine to have more family time. They meet their older neighbor Jud, who becomes a trusted family friend. When the family cat dies, Jud takes Louis Creed to this place beyond the creepy forest behind both of their woods to bury the cat. The next day the cat comes back but it's not the same. Then strange things start occurring, tragedy strikes and before anyone catches on, all hell breaks loose. That is the basic plot of the film without spoiling anything because the second trailer spoils everything. I really don't get why film companies think their audience is that stupid they need to explain the entire film in the trailer. (That's an article for another day)Pet Sematary the book is one of Stephen Kings most beloved works. It is also considered in some circles as his best work of fiction. The book dives deep into family, loss, dread, family tragedy and how humans deal with the loss of a loved one. It also is a dissection of how people deal with loss in different ways and what they will do to alleviate the pain. Directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer don't get any of that to translate to the screen. This is dread-less, jump scared, not very gory Blumhouse film. And that makes me sad. I don't mind Blumhouse as a company. They surprise me here and there but most of their ""scary"" movies follow the same tropes with the same execution. There is a lot of scares, as much violence on the screen to squeak by with an R rating and minimal character development.That's the number one thing missing from this film is the connection to the characters. I know that Jason Clarke & Amy Seimetz as Louis & Rachel Creed are trying. I can see them trying but it doesn't seem like they were into the characters to go in with. I feel like they are going through the motion. I didn't feel the chemistry, I didn't feel the regret when they do something totally stupid plotwise, I didn't feel the loss when something awful happened. It was very flat. And I don't understand how you cast John Lithgow and basically give him no meat to chew on. It's such a waste to have him in such a pivotal role and his performance is bland. Jeté Laurence who portrays Ellie fairs the best out of all the actors. I can see her going on to making some decent movies in the future. Especially if she gets to play the role (roles) she does here. She's got some real chops and out acts most of the cast around her.The film doesn't even feel creepy. The way it's shot has no style to it. It's very plain. And there are way too many jump scares. It feels like they build the smallest bit of tension and then boom, jump scare or back to back jump scares. Most of the gore comes early on in the film. There is a little bit of blood later but not much. I'm not saying the film had to be balls to the wall gory. (Even that wouldn't have helped it) But this is a King adaptation, give it some horror bite. If people think that Bohemian Rhapsody was over edited, watch this film. The jump cuts alone are numerous from the start and don't really stop until the end. This is not a spoiler, they left the film wide open for a sequel. Which I hope never sees the light of day. It's a very King ending but it's kind of just ends. Something happens that any person paying attention can see coming 20 minutes before it happens, then the film just ends.I'm extremely disappointed with this film. It one big experiment that needs to stop. I don't think people understand what they read when they are reading King's books. Because as I mentioned before, outside of IT, King books that are in the horror genre I say don't fair well to film adaptation. I can say just stay away from this film. Revisit the original or even better just read his fantastic book. Paramount dropped the ball hard with this one. It gives me pause for IT Chapter 2. Which I didn't want. Also, it's not a good look for R-rated bigger budgeted horror. (I'm stunned many critics of film that I trust enjoyed this film, were we all watching the same movie?)",Pet Sematary
362,CinematicGarbage,Sometimes Remade is Better!,4,13 May 2019,"This is the latest adaptation of Stephen King's novel with the same name and that novel was considered to be the scariest and darkest of Stephen King's bunch of novels. This novel had already been adapted once in 1989 and it was really dark, so much blood and a guy got his brain ripped but then it didn't have good performances so I only rated that 5.9/10. It's just bloody, not scary.Jason Clarke is great as Dr. Louis Creed, and then there's Amy Seimetz who played Rachel, Louis' wife. However, neither of their performances was my favorite, it was Jete Laurence as Ellie, their daughter. This movie was really challenging, especially when she came back to life, she needed a lot of darkness and her performance was impressive. Seimetz was great as well, it's just that Jason Clarke didn't have much to do in here. Seimetz's character had a dead family member, her sister Zelda. We knew that she's not the main character of the movie but she's the one who stole the show, much better than Clarke and Laurence, but Laurence's still my favorite. She's just a kid. The performances were way better than the one in 1989.This movie had changed a few things the 1989 adaptation had. I was really, really disappointed with the trailers, they spoiled a lot of things, even the death, Ellie. They came with the line ""Sometimes dead is better!"" it was a bit of spoilers too but it wouldn't be if you read the book or watch the 1989 movie. I only watched Pet Sematary in 1989 but didn't read the book so I didn't feel spoilt with the line. The 1989 movie was Gage who was crushed by the train, now it's Ellie, it was spoilt in the trailer (C'mon!). Then I would think that Gage died would make the movie darker, but then 1989 one was (I told you) not dark. I wanted it that way because Church, something belonged to Ellie (the cat) is already dead so it had to be someone else. I really don't read the book but, I heard the critics saying that this adaptation is darker than the book and I did find it full of darkness, especially in the end. I was familiar with horror movies so I wouldn't be scared and then the jumpscare of Zelda falling shocked me. I was given Goosebumps. The performance was getting crazier and in the end, slash, slash and kill!The biggest problem in here was some parts of the beginning. It was kinda boring and the performances weren't good. They just sat down and read, read, and read. I fell asleep at that part and I had to open again and again to understand what was happening that time but I kept falling asleep. Maybe the beginning was worse than I thought but in the middle and the end, I felt like they had tried better and better and it didn't feel this movie was bad anymore.
They really did well with the CGI and the cinematography. Full or darkness, a lot of bloody scenes (Louis and Ellie's death were not bloody at all) and you could feel it being real. There're also some disgusting parts like Ellie's hair (after coming back from the grave) and Church's fur (after coming back from the grave). They were...gross (and that's what made the movie scary). This movie was banned from my country but I had found a way to watch it, the Internet (hehehe).Except from dramas like The Green Mile or The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me, Pet Sematary is one of the greatest Stephen King's adaptations.",Pet Sematary

As a father of a young child, I was hesitant to see the film, but as a lover of horror and Stephen King stories I was curious, but wary.I felt that the casting and performances worked very well and on the surface the film began with potential. However, the standard for horror is much higher for films today. This film lapsed very quickly into cliches and tropes which reduced the quality of the experience greatly. I could try to explain why, but it's probably best to just say it quickly felt unintentionally and weirdly pointless - a movie-by-the-numbers.Where the trailers gave a sense that there was gravitas and meaning in the images, there is little to no subtext in the final images or the mysteries being discussed and discovered. I felt ejected from the narrative because the viewer is being spoon-fed very unimaginative horror moments (spooky music everywhere, without context, ground fog everywhere, too many dream sequences ...). The relationships between father, daughter, mother and neighbor all formulaic to the point of appearing like a caricature of 'normal people' in simple contrast to the carnage to come. Both the writing and direction felt simply uninspired.The film did not make me believe that they had earned the right to make me experience the deaths - it felt like the family and their cranky New England neighbor were mere vehicles for bland horror cliches.
I would not recommend the film.",Pet Sematary

370,Fortressofdoors,See it,7,5 April 2019,"No catch phrase title, and no long summary of what you already know.This is a hard one for me to review. Some of the changes they made, I was fine with. The first half is a little slow, but still interesting and is needed to introduce the Pet Semetary and it's history, although I think they could have gone into it a little deeper with the Micmac and the Windigo. The whole thing is dark, damp, foreboding and cold, and it's exactly what it needed. Had the original movie not been made, and this was the only film adaption, I think I would have appreciated it more. The problem is, I liked the characters in the original movie so much that they imprinted in my mind and throughout the entire movie I was trying to put these new characters in their places. It made it miss the original a little.
Again here, as with the original, they missed the opportunity to make the reanimated kids really creepy. I mean, they were hit by trucks for pete's sake, and in both movies they return with little more than a scratch (or in this case, a crooked eye) with their original voices. I'm not saying they should have been zombies, we've seen enough of that lately, but they should have been on the verge of nightmare fuel. Not only deformed, but also possessed by the forces that brought them back. Victor Pascow was almost non-existent in this version. So much that he might as well not have even been in it, and certainly not a pivotal character like he was in the original. The same goes for Zelda. In any case I thought they did a good job with Church. He looked a lot more dead than the cat in the original. The lame cover song at the end left a sour taste in my mouth.

Honestly it seems more like one of the later Hellraiser movies where they just had a random script lying around and decided to slap a famous product name on it, do a few hasty line re-writes and call it done. There is a reason these books sell millions of copies! People like the story!!! There is a reason the Harry Potter movies did very well, and the Percy Jackson/Eragon movies never even got completed...one stuck mostly to the overall story...the others did not. For those of you that say ""Oh its a story for a new generation""...Hogwash! Imagine remaking the Twilight movies only this time instead of a werewolf and vampire, you turn them into a mummy and a Frankenstein monster. I'm not saying they needed to do a shot for shot clone like the Psycho remake did, but come on. The 1989 version stayed extremely true source material and is far more watchable than this. Honestly just felt like I was watching ""Cabin in the Woods"" after a while with the ""redneck zombies"" or something. Like Percy Jackson, or Z for Zachariah if you're a purist who enjoys the story the way it was told, you're probably better off sticking with the original versions, instead of ""Zombie girl terrorizes family"".

I loved the book and the scene when Gage dies has always stuck with me - the way it is mixed with a dream and the realisation it wasn't a dream. The way Stephen King depicted the horror of that sort of loss - I can imagine what it would be like waking up to the horror of the reality of losing a child.I liked the decision to change it to Ellie coming back as she was able to provide a better performance than a toddler zombie which I think came across as quite unintentionally comical the first film. I liked the uneasy sense the father has as his daughter is not quite what she was meant to be. That bed scene was eerie...with them both lying there.I loved the cat in this film and the way the cat came back and caused Ellie's death in a way.I didn't like the bits with the disabled sister - portraying her as a monster felt wrong in the book and both films and I don't think it really added much.When I first watched the first film I was disappointed but with this one I thought on the whole it worked better.",Pet Sematary

They rushed through the original text, exchanging believable characterization and complex motivations for an extended ending that tried to model a home invasion film. Maybe that's also why they added those cliche masks. Other unecessary, cliche ""horror movie"" additions: a kids creepy drawing that went nowhere and dubbing light hearted music over a grisly scene. That dumb waiter stuff was unecessary for building Rachel's guilt, and we didn't need her hallucination or whatever that was. Subtracting authentic horror to add cliche scare hacks was bad. The big switcheroo I won't spoil, although it was already spoiled in the preview, was obviously made to extend the ending, and I could have done without all that. It was way too much conversation. We needed that dialogue in the beginning and middle.As a huge fan of Stephen King, I get upset when people misunderstand his work, and doubly upset when high salaried filmmakers make zero analysis and merely rob the big aesthetics. Please, please, please Hollywood, stop making marketing the filmmaker. Stephen King is not just about the scares. What makes his scares so good is his commitment to rich, complex, believable people who find themselves in a horrific circumstances. If you favor the horrific circumstances but cut all the believability, it's not Stephen King. He even talks about this when he outlines inspiring his writing process in his book, On Writing. There, he explains that his writing plot discipline was founded in a game where he must construct plots where the unbelievable becomes believable. For a King fan, this element is an absolutely necessary tenet when working with his material. Annie Wilkes talks about it in Misery, too, ""He didn't get out of the cock-a-doody car!"" King may no longer care, who knows, especially for a book he wrote a million years ago, but I'm a fan and I'm bothered.",Pet Sematary

What the 1989 version did or didn't deliver, THIS version was waaay off the mark and simply a waste of everyone's time involved. When making these remakes of classic horror films, why not try what the original directors tried, a little something called suspense.
This film from the opening scenes were going straight for the jump scares. AND THE CHARACTERS? I have hardly ever seen such poorly written characters even inside of classic B horror films. None of the characters were even remotely believable. From the little girl Ellie (played by Jeté Laurence) who just wonders off merrily into the graveyard near her home..no fear, no apprehension, to the Mother Rachel (played by Amy Seimetz) who is basically under some sort of mental psychosis throughout the film, to the Father Louis (played by Jason Clarke) who seems totally as oblivious as the Mother does.Nothing was believable or scary in this version. With a lack of suspense the film went flat almost immediately. There was no buildup to anything even interesting. Felt sorry for the legendary Jon Lithgow who played the not so creepy neighbor Jud, what a waste of his talent.I'd say the next time another director/writer etc attempts to SCARE the audience?

While this remake captures the basic outline of King's novel and the original movie, it also makes several changes. Firstly, it adds several twists to the original plot line, which are excusable to keep viewers guessing and to separate the movie from the original. What frustrates, however, is that the filmmakers added so much. These additions skewed the very deep and visceral meanings and themes of King's book and the original movie. Rather than being a horror-filled contemplation on the complexity of loss and grief, it settled on jump scares, gore, and the creepiness of violent kids and animals. The characters are skeletal at best with no real depth or development in the film. In 2019, when you try to remake things, they have to be great.

Sadly, the movie soon relies on some cheap tricks, jump scares and ideas that don't do anything to help set the tone King did in his book.I've read the book and I have to say, after about 25-30 minutes in, after a character is hit by a semi, there was little in the movie that made me feel like I was watching ""Pet Sematary"" as opposed to a movie about a creepy killer girl in a mask. The ending is rather ridiculous and absolutely nothing like the book. I wish I left early, the final 30 minutes was a boring and cliched slog.I know working with young kids is a challenge, but I think it was a major mistake to switch the victim from who it is in the book, original movie.

I however have not read this one so therefore have no reference point for a comparison between the literature and the films.Having seen the original movie back when it was new and I was just a kid it was indeed pretty scary. Having re-watched that version somewhat recently I can say that it is still pretty effective.The revamped one from 2019 doesn't really do a lot to boost the plot line. However I must say that the acting in the reboot is indeed on a much higher, more professional level than the original and this leads me to give a slight edge to this new version.On a side note I had a chuckle watching the ending of this one, though I suppose many people do in fact hate it.Worth a watch in my opinion if you don't have any A+ horror titles to watch instead. Enjoy!",Pet Sematary

398,kcrisenphoenix,Thank Goodness for This MUCH Better Pet Sematary,9,8 April 2019,"OMG! Brilliant! Very scary. Better by far than the 1989*horribly* acted original version. While tht first film had a decent script, hey-it was by Stephen King-for some reason it fell apart, especially due to terrible, really terrible, acting. Denise Crosby was of course bad, and so was Dale Midkiff, who I've seen turn out perfectly acceptable performances. So I don't know why he was so bad. Even Fred Gwynne was bad, his Maine accent atrocious.The acting is much better as well. I mean really really better. And also none of the actors are attractive. What I mean by that, is that none of them are gorgeous sex symbols. They're ordinary. Xxx, in her review of this movie in ""Entertainment Weekly"" said, ""The thing that has always made King such a heavyweight storyteller isn't the fiendishly-orchestrated scares which he serves up like a ghoulish symphony conductor (although those certainly help). Rather it's how he creates a rich sense of place and three-dimensional characters who we care about and whom we can see ourselves in. When bad things happen to them (and they will), we're invested because they're our surrogates.""Well that is what happens when this new crew of film makers chose the actors they did. Normal people, just like us. When everything gets scary? Then it's really scary! Loved it!This new film is amazing!The first part of the movie was nearly identical to the original, which is good because that makes it close to the source material.But then suddenly the movie takes a shocking deviation from the book and the original film. I usually HATE that! Why go off in way different directions if you're adapting a book? It makes no sense. I really really hated the movie ending to King's ""The Mist.""But this time? For some reason I loved loved loved the 90 degree turn and it amped up the scare quota a hundred fold. For the very first time ever, l preferred the movie version of a Stephen King book! Whoa! Even though it deviated from the source material by a good bit. Loved it. Will buy it! Wow!I don't want to spoil the film so I will just say this. Go see this movie! You will be glad you did! I like it enough that I will buy it when it comes out and watch it for years to come.",Pet Sematary
399,doveed,Tragic & Cheesy,5,5 April 2019,"The original Pet Sematary is looked at as such a classic that people forget it's a bad movie. On a positive note, it's one of the best of the bad Stephen King adaptations. That would lead one to believe that if it was done right, it has potential. I can't say that the Pet Sematary remake was poorly done in the traditional sense. Like the first one, it starts off okay but then it becomes so tragic and cheesy. Because I'm a Stephen King fan and a fan of the horror genre, I had to see it. But let's face it - King's books are much better than the movie adaptations based on them. As I was leaving the theater, I turned to someone and said, ""Wasn't that dumb?"" He paused for a moment, then said, ""Yep."" That pretty much sums it up.

I was looking forward to this one, because I thought the original film adaptation left a lot of room for improvement, and unfortunately this film did not deliver on that improvement. Just like the original, it was not scary, mainly because the scares were the most predictable scares you could think of, it's just like any other horror movie that has come out in the last decade. It is very bland and cliched, the characters are poorly developed and cliche. It takes no risks, and doesn't do anything new or special. In the end there really isn't much to say about it, it was just a very bland and forgettable Stephen King adaptation.

402,sophaljonesy,"Grounded, raw and personal",9,11 April 2019,"Pet Sematary 2019 is a much superior to the original in my opinion because it manages to stay grounded, raw, and make it personal. It lays the ground rules of how Pet Sematary works, and most of the scares come from the feeling of dread coming from those giant trucks zooming past the characters. These scenes worked as both jump scares but foreshadows of what will happen, and it is chilling given that in my country Cambodia, people are killed by trucks so frequently. The supernatural aspect is creepy enough, but most of the scares come from real things such as those cars, grief, and the dark thoughts of the characters. Besides this feeling of groundedness, the death pivotal death scene is very raw, and you feel exactly how the characters do. The death, the grief, and the lengths the characters go to deal with their problems is all to real, and this produces the raw feeling from watching. On top of all that, Pet Sematary impacts me very hard because I have lost my brother in a car accident, and the grief in the characters, and their guilt is very personal and relatable. So for me, Pet Sematary is a horror movie unlike any others because it is so real, raw, and personal.",Pet Sematary

It relies only on some jumpscares, the acting is good. But in the end, the 1989 version is better. It has better practical effects, as in the new version it should not be obvious the cat is animatronic in certain scenes. Building the suspense in the 1989 version is way better. But I love the gothic scenery in this new version and exploring characters more as well as the wendigo myth.

Well-cast. A few jump scares and some pretty eerie moments such as the masked children, but I was never on the edge of my seat. The original is one of my favorite horror classics. This was decent. It did not have the same scare elements of the first (ie. ""Hi Doc!"").

412,TheDragonTrader,Pet Sematary made soft,3,26 November 2019,"(I hereby apologise for bashing on little details that probably don't really matter, but I have to ventilate)Books and films are entirely different media. Books are made into films all the time, and some adaptations are rather good. And most of the time it's rather easy to look at the book and it's movie separately.But...... I cannot cope with Pet Sematary - a book by Stephen King that I love and that haunted me for months after I first read it - being changed in some of its fundamental aspects in the way that this movie did. I have many questions:First and foremost: why did the makers choose to portray Jud the way they did? With the introduction of his character I cringed; the book does everything it can to make us adore the friendly old man, yet the movie made sure we are suspicious of him every time he enters the frame. Also: why doesn't he live across the road? It seems like a useless change to me. And where is Norma? Without her we care for Jud even less. I hated how the makers made the good man look.Why the use of so many cheap jump scares? The book lingers, crawls under your skin and upsets your stomach, page by page, whereas the film builds up tension for about twenty seconds, just to release that tension immediately.Why are the dream sequences so obviously dreams? The book makes us doubt Louis' mental condition, but the movie makes sure we don't, 'cause... they are dreams, right?And finally: why did they change the turning point of the story? Is it merely to surprise Stephen King fans as well as regular cinema enthusiasts? Because if so, it's a stupid decision (fans don't want to be surprised, they want justice to be done to the book they love).Besides my many questions, the soundtrack by Christopher Young is an absolute - excusez le mot - abomination. No remarkable themes, no remarkable musical qualities and terribly used (by which I mean: used when there shouldn't be any sound, and setting the wrong moods for the wrong scenes (like with Jud!)).The acting is mediocre, the cinematography is unremarkable and the special effects are 'meh'. And yet it looks just professional enough to be taken seriously. But: the movie is too short. If the makers truly cared for the original material they were adapting, they would've made a film with a runtime of about two hours and a half or even longer; to make us care and to make the story with all its feelings of anxiety, grief and terror truly stick with the audience. They would've made it a truly disgusting movie with mutilated bodies and slow building tension, scenes of ten minutes or longer and a resolution that is deeply shocking. But they didn't. This movie is clearly made by people that have neither the guts, nor the competence to make a disturbing, creepy movie about grief and terror.",Pet Sematary

Maybe they should have casted better actors? Maybe the writers should have written a better script that fleshes out the characters better?Jason Clarke looks and acts the same basically throughout the entire movie, and John Lithgow's character has to be the most wooden one of all. When you compare this 2019 portrayal of characters to the 1989 film, there is no competition - the acting, facial expressions, pacing and overall mood of the film was simply done better previously. They had some soul. Their performance after the loss of a child flowed effortlessly right through the screen. Although the acting in the original film was not top-notch, it was definitely better than this 2019 mediocrity.This movie also relies a little too much on jump-scares, whereas the original did not. In this day and age, jump-scares need to be well-done and placed in unpredictable parts of the movie in order to scare the audience, but I felt like I predicted just about every single one headed my way. Tisk, tisk.Now, as for the the positive stuff that I enjoyed about this 2019 remake is that a toddler is no longer the final antagonist - which was a laughable point in the 1989 film, to me at least. The 2019 remake fixes this a bit.The cat chosen for the film looks very good, and was filmed very well. The cinematography is on point from a visual perspective. It's just the acting and the script that could have used improvements.Some techie nerdy notes - The Dolby ATMOS surround sound was also well executed, making me feel engaged and immersed in the Pet Sematary world, with plenty of sound activity moving around the room, crispy clear dialogue, and powerful action sequences or jump-scares that simply sound great.

Everything from the 'funeral ceremony' the daughter witnesses to the family not meeting their neighbour Jud who is in fact the one who introduces the father to the Pet Sematary is not how this story unfolded; it seems that the director thought the daughter discovering it, alone mind was a better idea...There is so much inconsistency in this adaptation that I don't know whether to laugh or scowl.Loise's first day of work nor his dreams about the Pet Sematary are remotely in line with the original story, the fate of the family's cat Church is vaguely in line, but again quite inconsistent with the original book and even the original movie (which while not a great movie at least it was consistent with King's book!)Jud showing Louise where to bury Church is vaguely in line with the original story, the cat's return is grossly inaccurate and hardly consistent with the story it is based upon!None of the following events for the first half of the film follow the story with any degree of consistency either.As for the second half of the film is just as bad.It's similar to the original story but again hardly follows the book's storyThe new story appears to be that Louise was unhappy with the 'changed' cat and decided to release it into the wild to fend for itself (nothing like the book or original movie)The next part of film involves Loise's daughter being killed by a truck (not the toddler as in the book or even the original movie adaptation!) - So we get a massive plot hole with the wrong character being removed from the story, so there goes the remainder of the story's validity!The rest of the film is absolutely pathetic, this should never have been allowed to be made! - if anything it's an absolute insult to the original story, movie and to Stephen King himself!!What an absolutely shocking monstrosity of a movie!

And maybe I'm just nagging here, but I have to suspend my disbelief a little when it comes to this older child standing in the road oblivious to anything around her. And the fact this family with two children would move next to such a dangerous road without at least putting a fence up to protect them. If you had a toddler would you move to a house where you can't ever let him outside to play without your eyes on him constantly.I have three kids, 12, 9, and 7, and they are extremely cautious of cars in the road. If even I step in the road they are on high alert. I know not every kid is the same, but it's not like I've been super overprotective of them. I just tell them the road is very dangerous and you have to keep your eye out for cars. So it's hard for me to believe a child of 9 would stand in a dangerous road for that long and not even glance up or hear the massive truck barreling at her. It was at least believable in the original that a parent could take their eyes off a toddler for an instant and he'd chase something into the road.",Pet Sematary
425,gatheringsnow,"Sometimes, Original is Better",5,16 July 2019,"This recent ""re-imagining"" of what is often considered the most disturbing and darkest King novel, apparently written at a very bad time in his life and the end result clearly shows it, leaves MUCH to be desired. While it's been a long while since I've seen the original adaptation from 1989, and I'm well aware it's not a perfect rendering of the original story either, I do remember that I felt a lot more dread and unease from that film than I did with this current one, especially in the film's third act after ""Ellie"" returns.While it didn't absolutely despise the film overall, and I'll admit, especially towards the beginning when the story was still developing I did find several of the scenes, especially involving Victor Pascow's apparation trying to warn Louis not to bury anything in the ""sour"" place beyond the Pet Sematary, quite ominous and freaky. I honestly found the scenes where ""Church"" comes back more frightening than when Ellie does, which I feel was definitely not intended by the filmmakers who created this new rendition.Also, the subplot regarding Rachel's sister Zelda felt completely unnecessary and forced simply put in to add more scary scenes to an otherwise sub par movie, I know that they were in the original novel as well as the 1989 film, but in both cases they were handled much better than here.John Lithgow playing Jud Crandall couldn't even save this film from mediocrity, which is a shame because usually he's a pretty good actor, but I guess he just wasn't give enough direction here to make anything worthwhile, and often came off as an old decrepit Santa Claus more than anything else. I'm not familiar whatsoever with the other actors in this film playing the Creed family, Jason Clarke or Amy Seimetz, as well as the two child actors, so I can't really compare them to any other roles that may have been done better, regardless I still feel that too much of what made the original novel and film ""Pet Sematary"" was for the most part devoid from this film, which is a real shame considering it had decent cinematography and visuals overall, but in the end, perhaps in part due to the mostly unknowns playing the main cast, and the cliched jump scares and other ""scary"" effects make it feel more like some cheap made for TV movie looking to make a quick buck.",Pet Sematary
426,treborquest,It was pretty much average,5,4 April 2019,"I was excited for this one, however, the book for me is one of Stephen King's best, so was also a bit cautious not to be overly excited. I don't like the original movie that much, so I thought it could have been done better and I had only seen one trailer very early on, so not too much was given away.
But while watching this film I was just hoping for it to become better more and more, and that annoyed me. Some of the shots were pretty cheap visually and the acting, there was just no chemistry between the parents. The best acting comes from the kids. it seemed to take forever for the 'accident' to happen and when it finally did it seemed as if the movie was rushed, the plot had to be told, because they were afraid the attention of the viewer would be lost. (I wonder why, we did pay for the ticket after all, so why would you suddenly rush it). And then the ending. The thing is, you have probably either read the book or seen the movie, so you expect at least something. But the movie let go of a few things from the book and then you just know, the ending is going to be different too. And that made it very predictable. There were just a few times I thought it became real horror and the images were graphic, but over all, it's just a family movie gone wrong. 5 stars for entertainmentfactor, but that's it. can't make more of it.",Pet Sematary

I went in expecting some changes.I felt like most of the changes still worked well with the plot and feel of the original story. Acting was solid-not exceptional, but good. I felt like the actors gave tense and emotional performances, though I felt like the interactions between Jud and the family were not well defined.The pacing, the cinematography-it was all good. Again, not exceptional but well done.One thing that bugged me throughout the movie was the set dressing and dry ice smoke in the woods/cemetery scenes. The fog looked like something out of an 80's horror, and not in a good way. The night scenes with the woods and fog felt very much like a movie set, and not convincing. That pulled me out of the story a few times to the point where I wish the fog had been left out or the shots had been more ambiguous to keep the mood going.Not a fan of the ending. It wasn't bad, but it felt like it was going for something stronger than the original, which might have worked with some tweaking, but came off a bit rushed and undeserved.All things consider, a very decent remake, worth watching, and faithful enough to King's Intent that I'm still content with it as a die hard fan.",Pet Sematary

431,amandagellar-31077,Not Too Bad,6,12 April 2019,"If we're talking remakes of Stephen King properties, this new Pet Sematary will probably go down as one of the least offensive ones. It's nothing major to write home about, but it's not a total embarrassment either.The acting is at least a major step up from the original film, especially Amy Seimetz as Rachel. Denise Crosby from the original came across as shrill and cold from scene to scene, but Seimetz provides a nice, grounded performance and easily comes across the best. Jason Clarke is definitely a better actor than Dale Midkiff, but he's a bit too intense from the start which hurts the film a bit. John Lithgow is great as Judd, but it's hard to top Fred Gwyne's performance from the original film.There are a few neat twists and turns with the narrative in this version, but they don't really amount to too much before the film falls into your usual run of the mill killer kid movie by the finale. There's a decent attempt to do something different with the ending, but I'm not sure if it works for me or not.This new Pet Sematary is worth a watch, but it's not terribly memorable.",Pet Sematary

438,gracehenson-30790,"Decent, but Unremarkable Retelling",6,12 April 2019,"The original Pet Sematary had it's flaws. Lots of them. The acting could have been better, some of the effects could have been better, and there were a few issues with the screenplay (written by Stephen King himself). Still, that film managed to haunt viewers for generations due to the harrowing, bleak subject matter and dread inducing visuals.This new adaptation improves the production values, the effects, and the acting, but something's missing. It's certainly a much more fun movie than the original, but the pacing is so fast that, at times, it feels as if someone has accidentally sat on the fast forward button on the remote. Moments that should feel emotional and heartbreaking are quickly passed by without much room to breathe.Yes, there's a big twist as to which Creed child dies (this was already spoiled in one of the trailers) and, at first, it seems like it's going to open the film up to some interesting possibilities, but it soon turns into a generic killer kid movie.Pet Sematary is nowhere near as haunting, memorable, or terrifying as the novel or its first film incarnation, but it's not a complete dud either.",Pet Sematary

440,embracing_silence,Great movie until the ending (spoilers towards the end),6,7 April 2019,"I've been a Stephen King fan for years, since I was a teenager, and one of his books that creeped me out the most was Pet Sematary. Everything about it was disturbing and unnerving, and while the 1989 film was good, it felt a bit lacking. My favorite and creepiest part from the book (for me) was when Louis is walking alone, barefoot, in the middle of the woods at night and he hears the wendigo nearby... The 1989 film never made any mention of the wendigo, which was a bit of a letdown.Everything that the original lacked, this remake more than made up for. There was great atmosphere, great acting, great camerawork, everything was great. There were a few changes to the story but for the most part it was faithful to the novel. They even included the wendigo, which I was very happy about.It is a lot more intense than the original and has more scares and blood/gore. Some of the bloody violent scenes were hard for me to watch, but that's a good thing. It means they did it right.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:The original story saw the Creed's two year old son, Gage, getting killed and his older sister, Ellie, surviving. For this movie, it was switched up and had Gage surviving (but almost getting hit by the truck), and Ellie was instead the one who died. I would have been interested to see another version where Gage had been the one to pass, but the original 1989 film already exists. I liked the direction the movie was going and it was very disturbing to see a sweet girl turn into a monster like that. I had no problem with that aspect.The part I did not like at all was the ending. In the book, Ellie was staying with her grandparents when her father brought Gage back to life, and the murdering happened. I was hoping that Gage in this movie would get the same outcome, but I did not like what they went with.Rachel takes Gage back to the house, Ellie kills Rachel, Louis puts Gage in the locked car, then is killed by a resurrected Rachel, and then the three undead family members go up to Gage in the car, with weapons, and the movie ends. It is heavily implied that they are going to kill and bury the two year old boy to be part of the living dead family. I might be biased because I have an almost two year old son, but I would have much preferred if he had been rescued by firemen or his grandparents from the car, and had him be the only survivor.I hope there will be an alternate ending, but who knows.This is a good movie, just prepare to be a bit letdown by the ending if you loved the original story or don't like child death.",Pet Sematary

458,ZombieGirlORV,"The Changes Made added to the Overall Story, without diminishing it",10,6 May 2019,"Usually I base the points I give adaptations from books, by how close they stayed to the book. But any real Stephen King fan can tell you his books are based around a multi-verse, so it's easy to imagine that this is simply another universe in which very similar events take place and move on from there. Jud's character, played by John Lithgow, was by far my favorite in the movie. He played the part so well, that I didn't even realize who he was for a very long time. One of the changes I liked, which I usually would criticize, was the way they showed the kids wheeling the dog to the graveyard. It was a story Jud had told in the original book, brought to life in the present day, and no longer the memory of an old man. It showed how serious the kids of the town were about their pets. The degradation of Louis's mental health was beautifully captured, as well as Rachels reaction when she saw the reanimated corpse. I say reanimated corpse because anyone who's read the book knows it's not the child who went into the ground, but something/someone else. One of the things I love looking for in Stephen King novels and movies is Easter Eggs, like the paintings in the beginning of the Mist, the way they mention Cujo at the beginning of the book, or how he drives past Jerusalem's Lot near the end. It's always fun to see what you can find. However, I was far too startled by those trucks going past and jump scaring me, that I completely forgot to look for them. They got me EVERY TIME. XD Which for me is rare. I can usually sense a jump scare in horror movies and brace myself for it, but not this time. I understand also why the changes they made happened. It would have been difficult to get away with an exactly replica of the books ending with the PC age being what it is. Though, for once, the change was for the better. It's far scarier to have a person half your size after you, than someone one-fourth your size. They managed to make changes to the story without losing essence of the original legend. A thing which is difficult to pull off, but it was very well done. A terrifying tale.",Pet Sematary

It seems we either did watch a different movie of my opinion differs from the majority. So to offset all the 10 score reviews, here is mine:I start with what i liked about the movie;
the cat, i love main coons. Even after it was turned 'evil' i still wanted to hug it!the acting of the little girl was decent in my opinion.the changes from the book i didnt mind at all.I didnt like pretty much anything else.
there was no atmosphere to this movie, it felt bland and generic to me. Watch a movie like Christine for example, another movie of a stephen king novel. That oozes with tension and atmosphere.there wasnt anything scary and only minor gory scenes. 1 scene was abit creepy, when the cat was sitting in the cradle with the toddler. The movie could have used more of that.Lots of bloody jumpscares! The cheapest and laziest way to scare the audience. I hate it! Its just the movie version of someone yelling BOO in your face.the acting of the adults wasnt convincing to me. I didnt feel the dread and despair of the father after loosing his child. The books did convey this really well. i didnt care at all for any of the characters.the little girl overpowering both her parents is very unrealistic to me, even while being resurrected there is no mention of her having superpowers beyond that.Ah well i guess i made my point. watch it, dont watch it. many seem to like it and i wanted to like it but its nothing more than a run of the mill, cliche filled horror movie.

473,Planet-38,Completely Misses the Mark,1,10 August 2019,"I eagerly awaited this release. Stephen King's novels have proved difficult (in my opinion) to translate to film because he is a master at engaging the reader's imagination. It's all about the psychological. And, he is very good at description - a master of f*ing with your mind. I can still, picture in my mind the death of Gage, so many years after I originally read the book.
But, with the advances in technology, I was hopeful the movie would master the psychological horror attempted in the first movie.
But, this new release is really just a run of the mill zombie movie disguised as a remake. It doesn't stay true to the novel or the original movie, and the lack of character development made it a waste of a good story-line. The 1989 release did a far better job, considering the limits of the time, at giving the viewer a feeling off dreadful understanding of the motives, and horror at the results.",Pet Sematary
474,hprashantarora,Godawful!,2,30 October 2019,"There is no denying that Hollywood loves Stephen King's work. His stories are not only well written but also possess that elusive quality of being very cinematic. Most of his characters are well defined, and it is not hard for viewers to empathize or fear them. In the hands of competent filmmakers, they translate fluidly from book to screen.However, the new iteration of Pet Sematary, directed by the twin talents of Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, is pathetic at best. I was quite excited when I heard that they had freshened up the story a bit, and brought in a new twist to the ending. To my dismay, upon viewing, I found out that the result is anything but exciting. At just over 90 minutes, it is not a drag; things move very quickly, and first-time viewers might even find it to their liking since the story gets to the heart of its matter rather rapidly, and that, in my opinion, is the biggest drawback of this movie.There is practically no build-up, no sustained tension in the story. The principal tenet of the original novel by Stephen King is ""death."" It pervades everything from the loss of a child to friendship, isolation, guilt, and broken relations. It spreads itself through one hell of a supernatural force that can twist reality and force kismet that is hard to fight back. Unlike, as suggested in the movie, it does not have a purpose. It exists because it is there, and when touched by human impulses, it leaves the tormented survivors inflicted with the torture of having to live with their loved ones stripped of their humanity. To make matters worse, they turn out to be worse than being dead.In their quest to temper the story, the filmmakers, while focusing heavily on a sense of dread and atmosphere, have ended up watering down the core values of the source material. For instance, the death of Victor Pascow, a recurring motif in the novel, is merely used as a scary-looking prop. The Creed family dynamic is Disneyique at best with no real chemistry between the couple. Their child, Ellie, played by the talented child actor, Jeté Laurence, is limited in her transformation from a loving child to a sinister entity due to a derivative script. Even the power of Wendigo, as experienced and lived by a terrified Jud, seems to exist in this new installment only to produce scheming zombies who somehow climb down from the mountain with an expansionist agenda. Rachel Creed's survivor's guilt after her sister Zelda's death, though well portrayed by having it transmogrified into paralyzing fear, falls within the cracks, too, not to mention the blink-and-you-miss hint at her parents' dislike of Louis. All of the above misfires resulted in a severe lack of narrative depth. Had they been fully fleshed out, as presented in the novel, they could have collectively contributed to creating a more convincing portrayal of a rational man like Louis being pushed over the edge after the loss of his child.But, the most significant loss of this movie is its failure in realizing the beautiful friendship that blossoms between Louis Creed and Jud Crandall (masterfully portrayed by John Lithgow). I think the 1989 version of this movie, though dated, did a better job at staying to the point and milking that part of the story to its full cinematic potential. Trust built upon their mutual friendship is the very thing that encourages Jud to share the secrets of the Pet Sematary with Louis and inadvertently ends up opening the door for evil to enter. It is a shame that the writers decided to portray Louis' take on it as merely having a neighborly affection towards the old man.All in all, Pet Sematary is interesting insofar as it is viewed as a 30th-anniversary gimmick (from the year the original was released), and nothing more than that. And in the end I leave you with a movie reviewer's supplication to Hollywood producers:Our producers who art in Hollywood,
hallowed be thy movie.
Thy sequel gets made.
Thy profits will be done
on paper as it is in the Swiss account.
Give us this day our daily sequel,
and forgive us for our bad reviews,
as we forgive those who make bad movies,
and lead us not into the franchise universe,
but deliver us from narrative woes.
For thine is the movie industry,
and the power, and #metoo,
forever and ever.Amen",Pet Sematary

I was very excited that they were doing a remake, but was terribly disappointed by the movie. I held off on writing a review for a few months so I could digest what I'd seen (and get over the abhorrent departure from King's work), and then when it was released for rental I watched it again. Nope - still terrible.I get wanting to change the movie all around to separate it from the 1989 movie; however, all that accomplished was to make the plot scrambled and the characters unsympathetic. You lose the bond between Jud and Louis (never mind the fact that JUD DOESN'T HAVE HIS ACCENT), which was a huge part of the storyline; there is no thoughtful discussion of life and death and what may or may not come after that made the characters in the book and the previous movie so much more relatable. Victor Pascow's part was horribly underused and there was never even any mention of the tension between Louis and his in-laws. The ""big twist"" was just for the sake of making it different from the first movie and completely destroyed the point that Stephen King was trying to make when he wrote this book. Undead Ellie was boring and cliche and the big ""dead family"" ending was stupid and pointless IMO. Most of the acting was terrible, though I did think that Jete (Ellie) did the best she could with what she'd been given. John Lithgow is a brilliant actor, but even he fell flat in this movie. Bitterly, bitterly disappointed. If you're a King fan, I would steer clear.",Pet Sematary

478,lmadorski,Really disappointing,4,7 April 2019,"I'm not a big reader, so I haven't really read too many of King's books. However, I think when done right, adaptations of his movies can be really good. I know he hates The Shining, but that's one of my favorite movies of all time. I also enjoyed the most recent It movie. However, I know a good amount of King adaptations aren't all that great. So I was hoping for something special with this new Pet Sematary.I'd like to get the good things out of the way first. The preformences from the two parents and Lithgow are fantastic. If the movie was as good as their performances, there wouldn't be any issues. The two little kids were fine, though the little boy basically has nothing to do. The cinematography is good enough and it does help provide some good tension. The special effects were also pretty great, most of the time at least.Getting the positives out of the way, I need to discuss the bad parts of this movie. There was so much potential, but a lot of things in the story are underdeveloped. There's a specific subplot that deals with one of the characters that adds to their backstory, but it honestly felt out of place. It didn't feel like it added anything to the movie, and didn't even really tie in with it. There's also another character that does certain things that are never explained, and I still don't even know who the character is. I find myself asking why that character was there with nothing to even possibly explain it. The story is also pretty predictable. I was sitting with my friend, who hadn't really seen any of the trailers(which gave away too much), and he was still guessing the majority of the things that were going to happen. There's a lot of foreshadowing in the movie, but it's way too obvious. Instead of just letting you know something will happen, but you don't know what or when, it just tells you what will happen(not directly, but with the obvious foreshadowing, it might as well have been direct). Speaking of the predictablity of the story, this movie is littered with tons of predictable jump scares. Nothing about it sticks with you to make it creepy that way, it's all about the jump scares, which really disappointed me.Pet Sematary was a movie I found to be really disappointing, mostly because of the potential I saw with it. I find it hard to really recommend this movie to anyone, except maybe the really diehard King fanZ",Pet Sematary

Good see & read will call it. Horror finds a way to stay. Some good qualities that hinder these living creatures yet soulless beings. To this one 2 -street freeway of oncoming debris. When local neighbor finds Ellie, pet passed away. The plot thickens as a childhood event keeps Racheal awake during this remedy attempt. All are in a to get another chance. Though being a PH.d., seems best medicine are ancient routines. Louis is maintaining a steady work load when after the revival of one animal springs a human who was in an accident with a message of content.
Haunting dreams wither down until at her b-day fiesta, the circle of life so to speak begins. Crushing this time as well as space, the boy & Racheal leave her husband to attempt what they choose as the best option. Jud makes sure all is quiet on the eastern front. Taking a trip past the burial grounds seems to be overwhelming for both parties. Once karma begins to creep back the way intended for bringing this to the underworld's attention. When timbers begin to fall, this close nit family is being torn to pieces one at a time. For the worst.
The ending scene ""hook, line, & sinker"" - Simon Gruber- die hard with a vengeance (1995). The last survivor remains in the car & the prelude to an ending. Good attention to details with bringing back some alone & one on one time with back stories included from the read. Both plots are working & the version is with not with Child's Play - (1988). Which will be re-entering theaters soon. For these backlands are ""the ground is bad"" - Jud. Good retrospect with how times differ, just a good movie still remains a good movie.

I was super excited as it's one of my favourite Stephen King books, and I grew up with the original but it does have aged a bit so I was looking forward to a new version.I left pretty underwhelmed. It was ok, but I was hoping for more.The acting is better than in the original overall but that's it. The cat was freakier and nastier in the original. The burial ground was massive with the overhead shot in the OG, here it feels like a poorly dressed set in the corner of a soundstage. I could get behind the ""big twist"" seen in the trailer as it gives the returned Ellie a couple interesting scenes but ultimately I feel the change made the story less poignant and horrifying. Yes, they used a puppet for some shots in 1989, but they also had the real kid playing Gage do some pretty intense stuff and nothing in this new version comes close.The new ending didn't work for me. That said, the ending of the book is one of the best ever (that last paragraph still gives me chills), but impossible to replicate on film, as nothing will beat how your imagination interprets it. The original did try but the new ending is way too off the mark. I really think they should have gone with Gage again, their excuse of not wanting to use a puppet is weird, surely 30 years later they could have had an extremely convincing animatronic/sfx mix. It was probably more a budget issue, or fear to offend, or more likely both. 6/10, not a bad movie but still a disappointment. The book remains the best version by far!",Pet Sematary

486,ramonbattershallrecover,A huge disappointment,3,21 October 2019,"You can always tell when a movie lacks coherence when you see the words 'Alternative Ending' in the extras - i.e. the story is so unfocused and poorly sketched out that it was possible to create an entirely new ending. either that or the first ending (whichever one that may be) played poorly in the test screening.Either way, without giving too much away, the creepiness and emotional aspects of the book are downplayed in favour of some significant alterations that diverge from the original material to bulk up the running time and to add some frankly quite irritating and generic jump scares. Also the in-joke about John Lithgow being in The Crown seemed more than a little out of place in a film that's supposed to be about a parent's unbearable grief over a dead child, as did the more than slightly absurd death by dumbwaiter.Some Stephen King adaptations (e.g. Misery, The Mist) work, others (e.g. Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower) don't. However, this misfire was slightly different, it failed because the people behind it thought they could make the source material more cinematic, and dumbed it down to the point where it had little beyond a title in common with the book.It's not terrible - it's just that, without the Stephen King connection, it would have already faded from consciousness by now.

489,michielodb,Really surprised me,7,17 April 2019,"Now I've seen the original film of 1989 a couple of times and it scared me so much as a kid. I remember being terrified of the sister backstory alone and all the rest did not help a single bit. Of course, that was more than 10 years ago, now I'm grown up and able to actually see the film as it is. It's been a long time since I've seen it and in all honesty. I'm unable to say whether it's actually good or bad. I do remember all the plot points that happen though, so when I saw the trailer for this remake, I said to myself: ""This going to be terrible. There are so many things spoiled in the trailer and nothing is going to be a surprise."". Was I right after seeing it last night? To my incredible surprise...I was not. This is actually a pretty good remake and the trailer could not have been better after seeing the actual film.Let's talk positives first: Jason Clarke is a very good lead I think, he gives a good performance, as do all the other characters. The two child actors are very good I thought and are just as realistic as normal children. The pacing is alright, they actually try to make you care for this family and they succeed, which is great. The soundtrack is very suspensful. The cinematography, apart from some impressive shots, is pretty basic I must say. There is a very scary atmosphere created as the film progresses which adds a lot to the suspense. Speaking about suspense, I can't say that I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, but they did do a solid job. Some of the scare factors are also pretty effective but without a doubt, my biggest praise for the film are the unexpected twists and turns. When this film openend, I thought this would be an exact remake of the original one, with the exact same events and lines. Without spoiling anything, I was wrong, oh boy was I wrong! There are so many things twisted around and I loved it.Now this isn't a perfect movie by far. My main issue probably is that the film overall isn't THAT scary. It all depends on what your scare level is of course. Some scares were really effective but for the most part it was just basic. There are the classic jumpscares that you can see coming from a mile away and sometimes the pacing is also a little bit too quick.In the end, this movie really surprised me. By no means a masterpiece or anything but there is so much to be appreciated about this film that I will remember it long enough. Definitely go see it!I give it a deserved 7.3/10",Pet Sematary

They only thing I can flaw in the area of gore is Ellie's body would've been a bloody mess after being slammed with a semi trailer, like come on.

I don't mind a movie getting an update or twist in a remake or reboot. But in this case some scenes were a bit over the top. Screaming guy, while there was no point in screaming or a devilish looking/acting girl while this movie is nothing about that. Also you don't really get to know the characters. About their life or anything else so that the viewers actually feeling a connection with them. It's all too bland, short introduction, nothing else.

But what person thought it was a good idea to spoil it in the trailer?",Pet Sematary
510,sarahkaye-30024,Surprising letdown,5,4 April 2019,"From the trailers, I was so excited to see this. I'm a huge fan of the novel, and whilst I'm well aware a certain amount of artistic licence goes into putting a book onto the big screen, they changed so much of the story that it was barely recognisable.
I understand why they changed which child was killed, you'd be hard pushed to find a toddler that can act as the living dead, but it didn't work with the older child either. In the book, the resurrected 'being' was taken over by a demon-in the film, Ellie is well aware she is dead, and she's living an unwanted 'afterlife' of which she is also aware, and it turns her evil.
There is no atmosphere in the film, the setting should be creepy and atmospheric, but I'll be honest, the scenes in the woods look very much like a stage set with dry ice covering the floor. It looks cheap and thrown together. The story is patchy and nonsensical in many places, it feels rushed to get to the end, and none of the characters are padded out enough for you to actually care about.
The one shining light in this is John Lithgow as Jud, he's incredibly well cast, but the let down with him is they didn't utilise him like they should have. One of my favourite parts of the novel is the friendship that develops between Louis and Jud, it's beautiful in places, and we learn a lot about Jud, his life, the burial ground, what becomes of anyone or anything that's buried there etc. But in the film he's just some old guy that pops up every now and then, with no real background-and there isn't a single whisper of the MicMacs and their part in the burial ground.
I also didn't like how in the film, they justified Rachel's irritating and bizarre neuroses about death by having her be responsible for her own sisters death, that was a completely new plot line addition for the purpose of the film
As for the ending, I'm not even sure I have it in me to comment, the ending turned it into a pseudo comical farce-the book left me feeling bleak and slightly bereft.

No comparison. (When are modern studios going to allow original horror movie themes again?)*The father character. Louis's agony was much deeper and palpable in the first film. I agree with other reviewers who stated that Clarke seemed to dial in his performance and was curiously deadpan. He may not be Oscar material, but Dale Midkif sure had the grieving dad thing down in the original, and Clarke pales in comparison, so to speak.*Tone. The original really nailed the tone and bleakness of King's story better. While it is much darker and daring than most modern horror films, the remake doesn't capture the dread and nihilism of King's source material. The original was almost uncompromising in this regard, but this remake seems unable or unwilling to venture into a similar territory (perhaps it's producers didn't have enough faith that modern audiences could take such a punch to the gut?).*The omission of the confrontation between Louis and Rachel's parents at Gage's funeral was detrimental to the 2019 film. This scene could have been an effective way to garner more sympathy for Clarke's version of Louis, which as mentioned earlier, is sorely lacking as it currently stands.*The Jud character: almost everything that seemed organic about his relationship with Louis in the original is absent here. Not sure if this is the fault of the usually great Lithgow or the direction and/or writing. Gwynne was a hard act to follow to be sure.*The family dynamics was more of a focus in the first film. We seemed to live with and relate to them more than the family in the new version.*Zelda was far more creepy and nightmarish in the first film. Another tough act to follow. Perhaps the toughest.What the Remake does better:* Amy Seimetz. Her portrayal of Rachel was more realistic and absorbing than Crosby's from the original. She was by far the most likable character in the film and I wish she was given more screen time and that Clarke was as committed to his role as was she. This would have created the much-needed chemistry between the couple and would have elevated the film substantially as a result.*The final act. I always found the final act of the original to be gratuitously gory, anti-climatic, and sub-par compared to the first two acts. The decision to swap Gage and Ellie's fates was a surprisingly clever and inspired choice in the new version. It rounded out the story better and made the ending feel more resolute.* The minimizing of Pascow's role in the remake. Pascow's character became more of a nuisance than anything towards the end of the first film, as the film abandoned the character's darker roots in the final act, turning him into a failed attempt at comic relief. This simply didn't work and undermined the purpose of his character.* The elimination of the character of the housekeeper Missy was a smart choice, if only because the film could not afford to spread itself any thinner than it already does.Overall, I prefer the original over this remake. Both films are respectable adaptations and possess qualities that the other one doesn't. Unfortunately, Jason Clarke's awkward and sedated performance in the remake proved a real liability, as the story relies so heavily on Louis's growing madness and the escalation of his grief, a feat that Clarke didn't pull off, leaving the film bereft of a key ingredient to make audiences buy into his character's actions and motivation for them.Pet Semetary 2019 however, has enough going for it to warrant at least one viewing, if only to get a new take on the classic story.",Pet Sematary

This feeling hangs over most of the film, which is great for tension and suspense. The characters are not developed all that well, leaving much to be desired- the whole family could have used a great deal more exposition. The film could have used more screen time to hash out the budding relationship of Louis and Jud. If there had been more to invest in, there would have been more ""skin in the game"" for the third act. The film is not bad at all, it is still extremely entertaining and at times very creepy.

532,MonkyMangler,"Nothing Special, but nothing Awful",6,20 July 2019,"Pet Sematary is one of Stephen King's best works and is easily one of my personal favorite novels I've ever read. Despite it's flaws i still enjoyed the first Pet Sematary from the 80's. Due to the Stephen King adaptions being really good lately, i was really looking forward to this movie. While i'm a bit disappointed, i still thought it was an enjoyable movie and is not nearly as bad as Critics are making it out to be.There's a handful of things Pet Sematary gets right, and one of those is the cinematography. The locations look eerie and it works very well. The acting is solid however some actors deliver better then others. For example, the characters Jud and Rachael are standouts and they do the best job out of everyone in the movie if you ask me. While the father/husband Louis just doesn't have a lot of personality to him and for a majority of the movie he feels stiff in terms of emotion. My major complaint with this movie however is by far the pacing. I can't help but feel that the movie was rushed and it was bouncing from one plot point to another. If we are talking scares the movie has plenty of them and only 2 or 3 felt clever and unique.So all in all, i was disappointed with how Pet Sematary turned out. They turned one of the best stories literature had and turned it into a decent cliche-filled horror movie. With that being said i never once hated anything that was presented on the screen. It just feels like a modern day horror film and not a Stephen King story, and it deserved better then that.",Pet Sematary

536,rubellan,Brilliant re-imaging of the classic story with and powerful ending,10,23 August 2019,"Typical of remakes, many reviewers choose to hate it because they somehow feel it disrespects the original. Sometimes that is true, such as Halloween, The Fog or The Wicker Man. But occasionally a remake surpasses the original, and I definitely believe this is one of them.First off, let's put it out there. As much as I like the original movie, it is a bit cheesy and campy at times. I don't find it particularly scary but it has a place for me because I saw it in the theater 30 years ago and have seen it many times since. Some of the acting is pretty questionable and the bits of humor seem out of place.The remake gives us a very serious and creepy adaptation. It's brutal and makes no apologies, and I like that. Far too many films take a safe route and those leave no lasting (positive) impression on me. Others take a very artsy direction and like to leave things irritatingly vague, often ending leaving viewers with a ? over their heads. Pet Sematary 2019 goes into dark territory that sticks with you.I'm ok with the change of the dead child being the older daughter because, as the filmmakers explain, it's more realistic getting an older child to do what you need without having to resort to puppets. John Lithgow as Judd wasn't a bad choice either. As charming as Fred Gwyne was in the role, he was a bit hammy. All of the actors in this version hold their role well, and none of them made me question the choices.While I'm sure the ending was dissatisfying to those who may have wanted a Hollywood rainbow ending, it really clinched it for me and put this right into the dark classic category. When you watch the film a second time you realize the opening sequence shows the brutality of what happened to the youngest child after the end credits roll. Wow, did they really go there? I love them for being that daring.So while those faithful to the original film were always going to dislike this regardless of how it was written, for me it's a hands-down winner. I've already seen it three times and I find it very satisfying. Quit comparing it to the old version, which really is more of a camp classic than anything, and just appreciate the dark aspects that make a scary film a classic.",Pet Sematary
537,crypL_edNOOB,Not scary as expected!!,6,27 July 2021,"I was very excited to feel the thrill of the classical horror movie written by famous Stephan King. The concept of the movie is very powerful, and it could be expressed in a way that it haunts the viewers for a very long time. But the movie is not scary enough. I believe it could be done better if the director more focused on the creepy visual effects and sounds. Overall movie is average, and like I said it could be better..",Pet Sematary

However within 10 minutes I knew it was going to be a struggle to watch this version, however I tried my best to be open minded. The characters felt shallow, I felt no connection at all with them, it really felt like they rushed through the build up because they were so excited to show their alternative ending, the best thing about this movie is that it reminded me to go watch the first movie which I hadn't seen in a long time. This film was not deserving of such a fantastic title, very disappointed. Even if it carried a different title I would only have offered it a 4 at best, but it deserves to lose another two for shaming the pet semetary name.",Pet Sematary
539,Pegasus7,"Really disappointing, no better than original and quite pointless....",5,21 August 2019,"I had such high hopes for this film when I head that John Lithgow had been cast as Jud Crandall. I was also hoping that they would 'correct' some of the original film, add in the parts that were left out, for example, Jud's wife Normal Crandall, and more of Louis's relationship with his in-laws. However, they actually changed the story completely by making Ellie, the daughter, the one who is killed in the road. They invent a completely different storyline by having Ellie bury her mother (not Louis), and also insinuate that Jud had buried his wife Norma there! It really becomes a different story, and a little ridiculous. There is no backstory of Timmy Baterman (except in the 'extras' section of the dvd), the Zelda backstory is completely wrong, and they even changed the name of Jud's dog Spot. I was SO disappointed in this remake, it could have been so much better. It's not clever or original to change the story, it just leaves true fans of the novel shouting at the screen like I was. They could have improved on the original movie, but even that was truer to the book than this.
John Lithgow could have been great with a better script. A wasted opportunity.",Pet Sematary

There are multiple head-scratching moments like that that my partner and I couldn't help but make jokes about as we were watching.

Neutral: changing the child dying from Cage to Ellie didn't give anything extra to the story. If anything it felt like practical way to cut short Ellie's side of the story. Cons: This movie totally lacks the weird dreamish nightmareish feeling that makes the book so good. Movie wanted so bad to be a horror film it cut out the center point: the father's inner battle with grief and temptation. There was nothing much about the magical world behind the pet sematary, nothing about the mental state of a man who enters that place.This movie could have been so good!

545,ayesha_lea,Great directing and atmosphere,9,1 May 2019,"I loved this. Although I am (like most who probably saw this) a hardcore Stephen King fan, I was a bit uncomfortable with the diversions from the original story. However for the most part, they made sense, in the context of restrained time in movies to explain everything. (ie, they didnt refer to jud stating that the longer one has been dead, the more wrong they come back, so Louis burying his wife would have seemed (even more) crazy, after his prior experience, so having the child do it made sense to me. Having the daughter be the victim allowed a dialogue with the ""returned"" child, whereas Gage wouldnt have been able to speak/provide any dialogue. I set aside my expectation of this in relation to the book, and with that done, i thoroughly LOVED IT. The children being creepy in the early scene of pet burial, which, was so against the set of the book, where i felt the pet sematary was intended to provide a contrasting innocent place to the horror on the other side, lent itself to more of the mood and atmosphere of the movie. Didnt much like Jud played by John Lithgow, far less jovial and friendly as he was portrayed originally.
Sadly as always, they left the end to allow for some slim possiblity of a sequel.. i do wish they'd stop that.
Fully recommend this movie.",Pet Sematary
546,christianolivarez-78828,Hug your daughter,5,10 April 2019,"This is the 2nd adaption of Stephen King's Pet Sematary (the first one being released in 1989). First off, I want to recognize the performances by the actors. Rachel, played by Amy Seimetz, put on the best performance in my opinion. Her character had a lot of development throughout the film and was able to display her talent ranging from her excitement for the new home to her terrifying realization her daughter has risen from the dead. Jud (played by John Lithgow) and Louis (played by Jason Clarke) also had very good performances but there really wasnt much back story on them and it made it somewhat difficult to relate to them in the way we did with Rachel. Good performances nevertheless.Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty. If you don't want spoilers then I suggest you stop reading. I wanted to like this movie. I really did. However, it didn't hit home for me. I understand the directors are able to put their own spin on a classic but I think they spun the wrong way. Also, I will be referring to the original movie as more people have seen the movie as opposed to read the book.So I will say this, the first half of the movie moves fast. The beginning is consistent with the original for the most part and really built the suspense. Now where it began to lose me was when Victor Pascow came into the story. The effects, make up and the lead-up was good but the overall encounter was underwhelming. Pascow has hardly any dialogue and the directors totally missed the eerie feeling that Pascow gives when he says ""I'll come to you"" after letting Louis freak out about him knowing his name. This lack of dialogue continues on throughout the movie.For example, when Pascow comes to him later that night, he hardly explains why he's helping and, again, has only a few lines. This, in my opinion, deluded Victor Pascow's entire role in the film. He tries to warn Louis before even knowing what he should be worried about. Without Pascow, there's no suspense. Pet Sematary is a heartbreaking story and Pascow's desire to help adds to that and it simply was not there in this film. Basically, this movie was suspenseful because we know what happened in the original.Furthermore, there was no reference to Rachel's parents and Louis' hate for each other. You know what that means? You guessed it, there's no altercation at the funeral where the parents blamed Louis for the death of their young one. How heart wrenching is it when the casket falls and Louis sees his sons lifeless hand as the casket bounces off the ground. How do you not include this? Beats me.This leads me to my next point. The directors went for the shock factor by killing Ellie (played by Jeté Laurence) as opposed to the son, Gage. This is okay. I was really surprised and appreciated the attempt, but by doing this, they lost a ton of leverage that the original movie provided. In the original, there's a huge emphasis on God and if there is an afterlife which truly bothers Ellie. This movie, for whatever reason, touched it lightly and skimmed over it rather quickly. Speaking of skimming, where in the world was Zelda? She had 2 scenes I believe and said barely anything in either one. I think I speak for many by saying that Zelda gave us nightmares with her voice, movement and hatred forwards Rachel.This brings me to the ending. Jeté, again, did an outstanding job with what she was given. The last half of the movie, however, really spiraled downward. It was almost comical the way they all buried each other to bring the family back. I'll let you watch that because it's a bit weird. It doesn't fit. It's like in High School when you put effort into a report and then started spewing out nonsense just to make the word count. It felt rushed. Initially, I gave this movie a 5.8/10 but now after reflection I'm dropping it down to a 5.2/10. Watch it for the nostalgia, but don't expect too much.",Pet Sematary
547,jashaw-58240,Misses the point of the original story.,3,6 April 2019,"Stephen Kings Pet Semetary is a story of loss, of the anguish and confusion that accompanies loss, and the depths that people sometimes go when their emotions careen out of control and fantasy becomes a sanctuary. The supernatural elements are simply tools to lend gravitas to the entire affair. They aren't necessarily the focus of the story,The 2019 screen adaptation misses the point unfortunately. Rather than spend any time making us care about the family, we get set pieces that are all meant to propel us into a supernatural laced second half. However the film fails to add tension or even an ominous feeling, and there are no real scares. The film digresses into a slasher derivative, which is an insult to the original story.Jason Clarke and John Lithgow do their best with a simple script, but neither actor is tasked to show any range. Jete Laurance as Ellie was the only noteworthy performance, though she's reduced to a scowling murderous familiar by the movies end. Finally none of the thematic changes were necessary as they don't add to the story.This is inferior to the 1989 film and an unnecessary reboot.",Pet Sematary

555,danielladue,The worst kind of reboot.,5,25 September 2019,"The worst kind of reboot. That is when a studio decides to remake an established film in the laziest way possible. Pretty much follow the exact same formula as the original, but make sure to use lesser actors, worse locations, and basically make a cheap copy. Every single part of the film was worse than the original. Yes the main cast, but also extra actors, sfx, and even the cats! Here is the GIGANTIC SPOILERS! Everything is almost exactly the same, but the daughter dies instead of the infant son. OMG! Also, the sister Zelda story is slightly altered in the way that she dies. SCANDALOUS! Lastly, the helpful ghost for our protagonist Dr.Louis is now a BLACK GUY! AHHHH!!! Maybe that was the excuse to give the helpful ghost only 4-5 mins of screen time? It really was so bad that I had to promise my girlfriend to rent the original 2 movies this weekend to make up for it. I know most people hate the 2nd film with Edward Furlong, but it really was a superior horror film to this. Besides, having to watch both of the oldies will be quality time to spent... Honestly, I would give this flick a 2.5/10, but I have to be considerate of people that don't read Stephen King or watch the 1st version of this film. I figure this film would be around 5/10 if you haven't already seen the better version like most people alive in the 90's (I forgot to mention that they found a really similar looking 3 yr old boy for the role of Gage, but it's wasted since Gage barely is in the film).....

My controversial opinion is that it also paid a nice respect and an homage to the book, albeit improvising on a few key points.The cinematography is fantastic!! I thought the acting was all pretty good as well. Much better that the original film that's for sure. I also felt that the changes and departures from the source material were all done in good taste and added interest. They made the film more than a mere remake.As with most of not all Steven King books, when made into a film they seem to loose the scare factor. They seem to be Heavy on plot, but light on scares. Is this a bad thing ? I would argue no. Sometimes the darkness of the tale itself is enough to satiate the scare. A film shouldn't have to resort to cheep jump scares if it doesn't have to.

While the original movie adaptation has terrible acting I still like it because it's a classic. And when I saw the preview for the remake I was excited, I figured with the technology and the stuff they can do with movies now they could really make this awesome and really scary. Unfortunately in my opinion a lot of the stuff came off looking pretty fake. There were a couple scenes with church (the cat) that were ridiculously fake looking, most of the gory bits were either not shown or they came across very fake. The jump scares with Zelda in the dumbwaiter were marginally creepy but as a rule I hate cheap jump scares. It wasn't a terrible movie, it just could have been a lot better. I know most people seemed to love it so it may just be me, maybe I had too high of expectations, idk. Also, I didn't love how much stuff they changed, for instance, killing Ellie instead of Gage. I get they wanted the creepy affect of having her talking about being dead or whatever when she came back which I can respect, but it was a huge change. And those scenes I didn't feel were very well done. If they had been maybe I'd have liked it better idk. Like I said, not terrible, but not great either.",Pet Sematary

563,emilywallace-49758,A Series of Missed Opportunities,4,12 April 2020,"I have to say that I'm glad I waited until this one hit Prime to check it out. I'd say I'm a big fan of King's novel (easily his darkest and most ruthless work) and I'm a casual admirer of the 1989 film by Mary Lambert. It was far from perfect, but what worked about it really worked well. Since there was room for improvement, I went into this new Pet Sematary hoping they'd do something worthwhile with the material, but if anything, this feels like it was adapted for Lifetime complete with bland cinematography, rushed storytelling, and unenthusiastic performances.There's a twist involving which one of the Creed children perishes, but that's all this movie is bringing to the table and, unfortunately, this turns it into yet another uninspired evil child movie that we've all seen a thousand times and it plays out like a zombie version of The Bad Seed.Best to keep this one buried.",Pet Sematary

565,Soodinum,A Fresh Take,8,14 November 2019,"Having seen a bunch of 1 star reviews, I feel the need to offer my opinion.Even back when it came out, the original movie was very uneven, being an admixture of a few great scenes and ideas with a lot of bad decisions which seemed to date the flick even at the point of release.This latest film could be considered in the same way as MCU's Spider-Man - not exactly true to the source material, but certainly capturing its spirit effectively.The new Pet Sematary film may be a departure from the book, but it contains some truly unnerving scenes and concepts, especially the ending (no spoiler), which is about as dark as you can imagine.I could imagine King liking this retelling of his story. It avoids being a flat remake of the earlier film and at the same time having surprises for those familiar with the book.It's not a masterpiece, but those offering five stars (which is technically meant to be ""average"", which this film isn't) and lower are just plain wrong, because of their unfair bias.",Pet Sematary
566,dobly58,Why?,1,27 June 2019,"Sometimes we get things right the first time round. Yes there's a temptation to re-visit something out of curiosity or to re-imagine that it could be better or to simply see what can be done to relive a fresh vision. But with movies made in the 80s, a period I'm particularly fond of, we knew even then that we had arrived at a nadir of creativity and flagrant open borders in originality. Today, sadly the 80's kids like myself have grown up and we're seeing our beloved childhood movies sold ""old for new"". The new generation are being mis-sold repackaged entertainment and labouring under the impression that it is theirs. Not so. Like the music industry, it has been diluted down further than imaginable and no-one is attempting to put a thumb print on the progress of the arts. We've hit rock bottom.
Mary Lambert's Pet Sematary became a cult classic where even the poster became almost iconic cropping up in movie sets and album covers. Unlike many female directors, Lambert delivered a movie that was brutal and scary and like her peer Kathryn Bigelow, (Near Dark. Point Break) avoided the trappings of gender expectations and delivered movies that went for the throat.
And now the remake. Oh dear. Speaking from a personal POV, all the things that I found scary in the first movie have been removed. Brad Greenquist's horrid apparition nearly destroyed me as a kid; the idea that I'd awake in the middle of the night to see him at my bedside tortured me for years. This movie skipped passed that, and I knew early on that we were heading off the map. The cast are all highly capable actors, and why did they do this? Who knows? John Lithgow has been been better utilised and let's be honest, we just can't imagine anyone stealing this from Fred Gwynne who was perfect.
The film misses so many opportunities and feels very much like it's just following the crumbs left by the original. Unlike IT, this movie re-enacts the story as we expected and created nothing new. And why honesty can that be justified? When Gus Van Sant remade Psycho, he ""directed"" a near shot for shot replica and at that time we wondered why. I feel the same about Pet Sematary. I found myself sighing most of the way through cringing at lines from the former movie being shamelessly cribbed and the overall tone was dreary. Not scary at all. For those that get their kicks reading about up and coming remakes, ask yourself this - if the original was good enough to remake, it's good enough to leave it alone right? This movie scores below average on my scale for sheer unabated plagiarism, and for being unoriginal as a piece of expensive art.",Pet Sematary

573,andyfindlay,A lukewarm remake.,5,2 April 2019,"'Pet Sematary' is dead on arrival with a strikingly weak first act, but snaps back to life with a dramatic resurrection in quality for an improved second act and a unsatisfying but well executed finale. The latest in a long line of highly anticipated Stephen King adaptions proves that they all can't reach the level of 2017's 'IT' or 'Gerald's Game' from the same year, and they can turn out as ferociously disappointing films that fuels huge potential as one of its greatest weakness.There is something about leading actor Jason Clarke that never sits well with me, more often than not he is the weakest part to any film he stars in. His way of acting often does not work. It feel as if he can never find consistency between natural acting and forced acting. His efforts frequently fall into the latter. He was near unpalatable here, where I brought a lot of his emotion, he did not sell scares and broke tension repeatedly. For a horror film this was not ideal. This being said, young Jeté Laurence does a spectacular job, within a first act which mis-sells the rest of the film completely, she stands out and shines, her talents do not go unnoticed. She is the perfectly charming, which aids the reminder of the film to blossom off an emotional core.Easily, the emotional backing this story so strongly grounds easily progresses to be this adaptions greatest strength. Some ideas are toyed with which I truly admired. The way the film approached PTSD in the Mother was executed well and was refreshing to see it addresses in such a mature manor within the storyline. Subsequently this helps gives this character a strong setup, which was not a common occurrence in characters here. A lot of backstories were skimmed over or completely left out.The impact of grief is another element which the story does a great job at developing and also approached in a strong manor. Addressing how different people deal with the loss of a family member, helped form an emotional connection to the family members, and even though the characters are proceeded relentlessly dumb you do begin to sympathise with them.More importantly, as a horror this remake, is frequently very poor and follows many typical genre clichés. Almost the entire story was spoiled during promotional material but of the surprises that remain, they are predictable and underwhelming. Tension is sometimes sustained well, but in no means is this a scary film. Attempts are jump scares are on the whole cheap, and some repeated many times with little success. When tension is created well it is inserted well. Near the end, where still unscary, there a certain edge of your seat tension that keeps you engrossed. When the story falls into slasher territory it does become an extraordinary amount of fun.Frustratingly a lack of scares in this supposed horror is damaging, but accompanied by a less than mediocre first act, damage was uncontrollably serve. Script wise, it is dumb and follows genre tropes. Several times dialog can be predicted word for word, and this is sustained as a constant issue. It was just uninteresting and flat scripting. The tone is an uneven. Often the tone comes over as a drama opposed to horror. Pacing was a huge issue which through the film is a mess, but eventually becomes less noticeable. Nevertheless, some scenes are executed to perfection, but most occur in the second act which is what forces it out, of this murky film.An unfortunate disappointment needless to say.",Pet Sematary

576,traciecavill,Unimaginative King Adaptation,5,14 June 2019,"One can't say much about this new Pet Sematary without spoiling a fairly major twist midway through (even though it was already spoiled in the promotional materials), but this twist does breathe some new life into this adaptation for a few minutes before turning into another series of killer kid movie cliches.Before this twist, it's an unremarkable, by the numbers retelling of the now classic Stephen King story. Amy Seimetz is quite good as Rachel, but Jason Clarke is cold and bloodless as Louis. Since Louis is our main source of audience identification, this ends up being a major misstep and hurts the film a good deal. Not once are we ever really on his side. From the get go, he seems terribly dour, serious, and not much fun to be around. John Lithgow has always been one of my favorite actors, but he's given very little to do as Judd and that's a shame. Maybe he could have brought some life into this.Once the big twists shows up (which deviates from King's novel and the original film), you might find yourself sort of excited and on edge for the first time since the film started, but they don't do much with it and the last act is hilariously ridiculous with an infuriating ending.If you're really curious, wait for cable.",Pet Sematary

He does this in a moment where he isn't thinking straight and has overwhelming grief.

The writing is just mehh. The story doesn't have anything special to it. The movie feels bland. The characters are not well presented. Especially the dad just feels bland. You don't really feel anything for the characters. The movie is just unrealistic because the characters make some dumb ass decisions. Another problem for this movie is: what the hell is going on? If you haven't read the novel there are too many questions left unanswered. The athmosphere should be creepy but it fails. Instead the the writers use the legendary modern cheat code to hide the lazy writing: my biggest issue of the movie:Cheap jumpscares, a lot of cheap jumpscares. I was sitting in the theatre pissed off. Most modern horror movies rely on unnecessary jumpscares to grab some big money in the box office.

I didn't feel like I was as on edge as I should have been in the final act, which is really where it all falls apart. Anyone who gets resurrected just goes mental and thrashes about like a mad thing, and I'm just sat there wondering what the director was trying to go for.

591,CMTempest,"Inferior to the 89 version, but still worth seeing",7,5 April 2019,"Okay so overall I'd say the new Pet Sematary was... serviceable. There were some parts of it I really liked. The themes of death and grief are again explored really well, (perhaps better this time around actually) and the acting and effects are definitely much better (as you would expect). However, the movie felt strangely inert and disaffecting to me; like it lost its soul somewhere on the drawing room floor.It seemed very perfunctory in that it jumped back and forth between being a shot for shot remake of the original that wasn't very compelling at all, to a sort of obviously telegraphed series of deviations where it would present the same set up to a memorable scene from the original (often in an almost overbearing kind of way) and then be like ""gotcha"" and switch things up with a quick smile and wink. The reliability of this formula actually grew annoying because it made the movie very predictable despite the changes (not to mention that these misdirections don't work at all anyway if you've seen any of the marketing). The film was also much too fast paced, and would hardly give you time to sit and think about what the characters were saying or what was happening before hurrying on to the next thing. John Lithgow was surprisingly underused as well, and his part was poorly written. Being the great actor he is he's able to salvage it somewhat. Still, it's a shame because Jud in the book is a very interesting and likeable character, and his portrayal by Fred Gwyne in the original movie is iconic.All that said, the movie still manages to be emotionally devastating, and the tragedy hits you hard. It's different enough that I'd definitely say it's worth seeing, and, oddly, the parts I enjoyed most and found to be the creepiest had to do with the changes they made and the new stuff they added.Before it devolves into a slightly smarter than average slasher/gorefest, the final third of the movie has some very disturbing and unsettling stuff that you just don't see in mainstream horror movies like this. It has to do with the conversations between (SPOILER) Louis and Ellie after she comes back, and it seriously goes to some messed up places. The young actress who plays Ellie does a fantastic job. Also, the new ending is very different and it's actually a bit bonkers haha.I probably lowered expectations a little too much by now, but I think most fans will enjoy it. In my opinion it's about as good as 2017s It (except much darker), and it compliments the original movie well. They both succeed and fail in different ways, and neither really comes close to capturing the greatness of the book. I still think that I liked the original more because it takes it's time and tells King's story more fully.Overall Rating: 7.3/10.",Pet Sematary

My friend (loves the book, is just ok with the og movie) had to walk out, she couldn't handle how poorly the story was being told.Pet Sematary mainly sucked because it was so damn safe, boring and felt like an average remake, not a creative way to redo the story. Everything similar to the movie wasnt as fun or entertaining (except the hospital gore scene and the makeup on the mom's chained sister) and everything different wasnt nearly as good. Even though the makeup looked better with the undead guy and the sister, the movie had no clue how to purposefully and emotionally include them in the story. It felt obligitory, like they know the characters are in the story but the film makers have no idea why. The cat was the best part. One of the best movie cats I've ever seen, I could never tell when they weren't using a real or puppet cat, as far as I know there were no cgi cats. Or they just looked really good. The movie did not overuse CGI, which is a plus. Overall, everyone is going to forget this movie in a few months, just like the Carrie remake.If you want to convince yourself that the movie is automatically good because it looks more modern that the 89 version, have at it, but you are choosing comfortable aesthetics over good storytelling.

597,pwbeatty,"Not Good, Not Bad",5,15 August 2020,"'Pet Semetary' Is Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer and Stars Jason Clark as Louis Creed, an ER doctor who in order to spend more time with his family quits his hectic city life for a quieter lifestyle. When exploring the new property, his wife, played by Amy Seimetz, and their two children come across a local Pet 'Semetary' where families bury their dead animals. But there is dark magic beyond the Semetary, that lures Louis after the death of the family cat to bury it there, bringing it back to life. But Louis learns quickly that sometimes dead, is better dead.Stephen King movie adaptations... do not do well. King has so many classic stories that we have seen adaptations for, but either they are direct to DVD quality or completely different from the source material like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""The Shining"". With the success of the newly rebooted 'IT' franchise proving incredibly profitable for WB, other studios were eager to announce their new King adaptations themselves. Pet Semetary is one of them announce shortly after 'It'. Sadly, 'Pet Semetary' proves that in a world full or reboots and reimaginings, some properties are better left dead.The films lead performances are acted very well bu both Clark and Seimetz, and the tone overall is very consistent and eerie. I enjoyed some parts relating to the characters story arcs and the way the handle to subject of the film; death. The death part is personified by the families cat and I have to admit, the Cat/'s give great performances as just the most demonic looking thing you could see.Where the film fails to grow is in its storytelling. The screenplay feels like it is missing crucial character points, and because they feel missing the characters actions and choices made in the film come across as very dumb. That only gets enhanced as the story and scares never shift into a higher gear than generic 'jump scares' all too common to the horror genre.The third act changes a lot from the original source material, opting to go for their new take on the classic, however, none of the new ideas presented really find any weight in this story and arrive too late for me to relate to it completely.In the end, I don't think 'Pet Semetary' is in the running for 'worst Stephen King adaptations' but in the end, it lacks enthusiasm for its own source material, and in the end, feels like the Cat in the film, half-alive.",Pet Sematary

599,taralunn,Massive spoilers below,1,3 April 2021,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERSSo... I'm not a fan of remakes... But I've read the book and seen the original.... And to be able to review the remake I had to look at what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy about the first one.The things I loved about the first one were:Jud (the old guy) was just the creepiest and most amazing character in the original... His presence and demeanour was captivating... Warming and likable but with a grave undertone.The original pascow was really haunting and didn't need to do alot for his presence to be knownI loved the general creepy feeling and ambiance of the first film and the gore... You rarely get that nowadays
The story line and plot were also greatThe bits I didn't enjoy about the original film:
The little girl was such a spoilt winey little brat that I just wished she would shut up. I had no feeling of compassion for her and I found her irritating. She was just always whiningHer mom was the same... Self righteous... Self pitiful and just a typical whiney bratBut overall the film was great but I didn't watch it again because I just couldn't get past the mum and the girl...So the second one...
I was pleasantly surprised that the little girl was really cute friendly and likable... That was my first biggest relief...Jud was now played by John lithgo. He was OK.. Not too creepy but subdued and weird in his own right... And he seemed to be a little sinister in this one which is a vibe I didn't get from the first one so I didn't like that. He added no extra to the film at all where as in the first one Jud made the film.The mum this time isn't too whiney so again made the film more palatable...I'm not sure if it's my eyes but some of the scenes in the cemetery (the wilderness behind) didn't look real... Not quite cgi... But fake in some way... Like superimposed (I'm not technical so I'm not sure) but in the first one I never felt like that... it felt real and I felt part of the setting and that added to the feeling of unrest. I didn't get that from the scenes in this filmHang on... Who got killed by the truck? Oh man... Why do you have to change such vital plot details...Pascow got hit by a car... Brains hanging out.. Bones protruding... Face hanging off etc.... The girl gets ran over by an Arctic size truck and she's fine... Dead... But immaculate... The mind boggles.She doesn't come back as a creepy possessed murderous girl... She comes back as a weird and bratty little girl with an attitude problemThen turns into just a regular child killer with a mean streak.WHERE WAS THE CREEPY HOUSE MAID L FROM THE FIRST FILMTHE SPINE TWISTED SISTER FROM HER CHILDHOOD... WAS NOT EVEN WORTH ADDING TO THE FILMSo overall this film was not really worth the remake... It added nothing new or better nothing extra or more frightening. If anything it was less in the terms of scare and horror. No suspense and no real drama. If anything it just looked like a film about a dysfunctional family.Sometimes you can not enjoy a film but still recommend it... Because you can see the quality but it just isn't your thing.I didn't feel that way about this film. It was just pointless.",Pet Sematary
600,jayantamitra,Spooky!,10,25 July 2019,"Don't care out the negative reviews.
The movie was really intense and creepy specially the jump scares of Ellie when once she came back alive after she dead.
Liked the way how they plot the Stephen king novel turned into terrifying Hollywood masterpiece.",Pet Sematary
601,hantru,Meh! Keen to see the original now,4,27 December 2020,"This was okay until Ellie came back from the dead. Why did they need to make her like some sort of super charged exorcist child? Would have been way more creepy if she had just seemed slightly ""off"" like church. From the point she came back the whole thing was just lame. Also agree that the whole thing felt disjointed. Fragments of what seemed important information and storyline just wasn't woven in effectively. Now I'm keen to see the original....",Pet Sematary
602,joymontgomery-04744,I'm Glad I Waited For Video,4,16 July 2019,"It's hard to call Pet Sematary a bad film. It's not really. It's more of a disappointing film considering the wonderful source material it springs from. The original film wasn't a perfect work of art, but there were still some memorable and even frightening moments and images that managed to stick with people for years. I have a hard time imagining that anything in this film will stick with viewers for more than 30 minutes after they turn off the movie.What makes it even stranger is that, besides a midpoint twist (and a truly odd ending), it's basically the exact same story as both the novel and the original film, but condensed and sped up. It also doesn't help that Jason Clarke seems awfully miscast as Louis and it's incredibly hard to warm up to him. Since he's the lead, that makes for tough going.",Pet Sematary
603,familyofdavs,"Uhhhhh . . . Well, it needs work.",1,21 December 2020,This was easily the most overhyped horror movie of 2019! The acting and creepy daughter are very bad and basically everything that was good and scary about the original adaptation is done poorly in this version. Except for Zelda and the scenes with her. 😖,Pet Sematary
604,kennybelliveau15,Typical Horror scares.,6,17 July 2019,"Anything Stephen King related at least peaks my interest to some degree. He is an icon of horror but this film does not quite live up to his legend.Every scene came and went like it was supposed to. Not one aspect of this film dared to do something different with the script and it played out as fairly lacklustre despite amazing visuals.It at least felt more modern and more plausible during this interpretation of Kings work. Clarke did play the desperate dad character well and Jeté Laurence did bring a creepy aspect to Ellie after her return.The third act was by far the best but all the horror elements leading up to hurt it. The back story stuff with the sister would have proven a more harsh reveal had they not revealed the truth prior to Ellies announcement.Aside from Clarke and Laurence all of the performances felt like throwaways and I am sad to see that happen to someone as talented as John Lithgow. Jud could have easily been left out and it would have been more thrilling to let the Creed family realize what was in their back yard on their own this time around.Horror is a genre that already has troupes that most films follow and the 2019 version of Pet Sematary falls victim to each one. Predictable jump scares, ominous middle act when learning of the possibilities on the property and a finale that does not lead anywhere as the prospects of a sequel seem slim to none.If you want just another horror film to pass the time then this one fits that bill. If you want a game changing thriller than this one may just have to be a pass.",Pet Sematary
605,joseph-masalsky,Unnecessary and Bland,6,14 May 2019,"I think if you are going to try to make a new film version of a Stephen King novel that has already been filmed, you better have something new to add to it. At least it should be creepier or scarier than the previous version. This is neither. There's a completely pointless change up of a key element that does nothing but making this less memorable. The cast is good but they are really giving nothing to do but plod straightforwardly though the basic plot of the book. The cemetery, the woods, the dead people, the cat... none of these are as creepy in this version. It's sad because this was probably the scariest book I ever read and I was really hoping someone could do it justice. My advice is to stick to the flawed but creepy and fun 1989 version.",Pet Sematary
606,chrislock35,Not as good as the first film,4,15 April 2019,"I was dissapointed, the movie feels rushed and they missed out so many elements that made the book one of Stephen Kings finest.
The Semetery is built on an old native american burial ground yet that is even hardly mentioned, the first film did that job so much better, it lacked atmosphere, it wasn't in the least bit creepy, and in the book Louis Creed goes completely mad trying to bring his kid back to life and then his wife, at the heart of the book is his grief at losing his family and wanting to bring them back no matrer what eben though he know's it's wrong, this is what makes the book so frightening and this movie had none of that.
The first film i think was alot better than this and even that was nowhere near as good as the book",Pet Sematary
607,batzalos,Movie Semetary,6,10 April 2019,"This movie has 2 major faults:
1) an unnatural-forced tense armosphere, which is nearly impossible to transfer from book to movie.
2)there were 3 filler sub-stories that added nothing to the plot: the wife's sister, the dead boy talking to little brother and the legend of Wendigo.
Dialogues- expositions- acting-twists were adequate while visual effects were so anticlimactic( get a real creepy forest)
Straight to the Semetery of new era massive produced Hollywood horror mystery movies.",Pet Sematary
608,SickBoyGoreHound,So many fake reviews it's embarassing...,2,10 June 2019,"Not that IMDb has ever been a particularly trust-worthy website, at least for movies reviews, but the amount of obviously fake reviews, not to mention the same reviews being posted twice or more from different (and, sometimes, even from the same) accounts is REALLY embarassing.As for the movie itself, it's a dud. First of all, is not based on King's novel, as it is obviously a rewrite based on the script of the 1989 film (and, in places, it even tries the shot-for-shot approach) with minor details from the novel added to please the ""easiest-to-please-fan"".
It's not TERRIBLY directed, and the actress playing the little girl is... mostly good (until she isn't anymore) and... that's pretty much all the positives.Most of the acting is wooden and, clearly, uninspired. It's not even the actors' fault - at least, not entirely: they are served by a piss-poor script with some really terrible, dumbed down, cheesy dialogue that, often times, repeat itself.The photography is just a trainwreck: mudded, flat, with no sense for the use of color or depth. It's so ugly it reminded me of a bad early '90s tv show.In terms of story, they stripped away most of the character development, and we're left with a super-streamlined story that goes rushing (and stumbling) to one place to the next without any kind of build up and, thus, without nothing even resembling tension - and characters so underdeveloped that it's almost impossible to relate to them (even if the events described are so dramatic that it should be easy to).It doesn't abuse jump-scares, which WOULD be a good thing, but the problem is that there's, literally, nothing in their place.The ""twist"" they added could've work and it was the most interesting thing in the movie, but they just didn't do anything with it.The special effects aren't bad but, somehow, in a movie that doesn't use a lot of CGI they managed to make almost every single CGI shot look so obviously fake it was painful to look at.",Pet Sematary

This movie is absolutely dire, I loved the original, I knew this differed from it, but I didn't know by how much.
All I can say is that i was laughing at the end due to the lack of vision they put into the third act.

I've always loved the original and have thought it has stood the test of time, but this new film executes the original story concept very well if not even better, with only a couple big changes. The dark and tragic tone is set from the start and never lets up throughout. There are some moments and scares that do follow modern horror cliches, but there are definitely some that are built up by magnificent ominous atmosphere. Jason Clarke once again shows he's an underrated actor that has some genuine humanity and emotion in his performance. John Lithgow is also very solid as well as Amy Seimitz. The camerawork is very crisply shot and creative and creates some fantastic visuals of the haunting wilderness settings. There are some moments towards the end that seemed rushed, but overall this is another great new age horror remake that honestly deserves loads of credit for following subject matter properly.",Pet Sematary

620,opheliahasrisen,This Movie Stinks Worse Than A Dead Cat,4,23 April 2019,"I'm one of those rare freaks who love remakes. I don't like this one. I don't understand how wrong they could go with Kings brilliant story line. Genius was served to them on a platter. I thought maybe part of the reason it was awful was a low budget (not saying there aren't many good, even great low budget films). But I did the math, and with inflation, they had virtually the same budget as the original. So why it looks like a youtuber filmed it, I don't know. Just a bad cinematographer I guess.The amateurish filming could have been overlooked if they had made decent casting choices.I thought that would have been difficult because Fred Gwynne gave one of those untouchable performances as Judd. Obviously it wasn't difficult because it seems they picked John Lithgow randomly out of a phone book. I can't that guy seriously after Third Rock From the Sun.There was no depth to the father and he looked like someone had hit him in the face with a shovel. He looked like a boxer not an MD. Really there was not much depth to any of the characters, which made it hard to like them. To me this misses much of the point of King's book and the original film. The horror isn't really about a spooky graveyard. It's about the horror of what this family is going through with the death of their child and the unthinkable things the father did to cope. It's about the lengths one will go to for the ones they love.Victor wasn't scary. Victor and his creep factor really was a pillar in the original. I guess no one realized that and just picked some random guy.I really think the casting department needs to do a walk of shame.The writers need a kick up the butt too. I was cringing at the dialogue in the scenes that were transplanted from the first movie. Well, obviously I did a lot of cringing during this filmThe Ellie thing could have been brilliant, but that fell flat on its face too. She wasn't scary. In the original Gage gave me the willies, but then again toddlers are terrifying.I'm a big fan of The Ramones, and LOVE the song they did for the original. Starcrawler did a great cover.....

Why are they always under expectations when the stories themselves are so good. This isn't scary, it creates no atmosphere and as others have said it's all too rushed and skips over relationship developments that could have helped you warm to the characters.The Shining and Carrie are the only exceptional movies of his novels. I sincerely hope Salem's Lot won't be ruined. The mini series in the late 80's was scary too so I hope they don't wreck it now.... So disappointed :(",Pet Sematary

627,nanagladys,R. I. P Pet sematary,1,6 April 2019,"As a fan of the book and the original movie i wanted go into the movie with an open mind and to give it a chance, I knew within five minutes that this was going to be NOTHING like the book or the original movie. Although in some cases change can be a good thing sadly in this case it really wasn't! Where do I start? Jason Clarke and Amy seimetz had no on screen chemistry, they weren't convincing as a couple at all, I didn't have an emotional connection to the parents there was no warmth no real feeling of family, Gage was absent when Ellie wandered into the woods, with Louis at work had Rachel left him home alone? There was no building of friendship that grows between Louis and jud, it was like heres two men that have been neighbourly sure, but not even nearly close as they are in the book. My daughter has a cat, my neighbours are nice people , would they lead me to a magic place to bury it and bring it back from the dead ? No! That requires at minimum a huge amount of trust! A bond that wasn't there. No discussion about has anyone ever buried a person up there, no watching the children grow and flourish, that happiness and joy that seems perfect only to be ripped apart by the horror of the accident. No broken Rachel and Louis being overtaken by the power of the place unable to be there for his remaining family. No real background on Rachels parents and, the dislike they have of Louis or that he has for them, the hatred and horror that combusts at the funeral of the child. All these things that to me are key to building the bigger picture weren't there. They could have done amazing things with this movie, modernized it so its current but with the connection and the terror that is felt in the book and the first movie. All that and even paxcow as Ellie calls him didn't say what he was supposed to say, Zelda was really NOT scary, I thought they would make her equally if not more terrifying than original. and the end? Really??? Was this a remake? No, it was a different story that borrowed the original character names and the original title of a truly heart wrenching and horrific masterpiece and made into what felt like a cheap knock off. For me a stranger sat next to me in the cinema summed it all up when she said to me "" I don't remember any of that happening in the book "" I looked at her and said "" that's because it doesn't"".",Pet Sematary

If you forget that this is based on a book it is actually a pretty good twist on things, the dark forest, the cover of the night where things literally go bump in the night.I always try to forget the story of Rachel and her sister, but this time, well this time they took a new take on the story, same outcome but this time, *gulp* this time they introduced a dumb waiter into it - man I frigging hate those things.

The original is a classic but I always thought it was very anti climatic. The new movie adds a whole new layer to it that I really enjoyed.

654,mattangley,Horror for the mindless viewer,1,10 April 2019,"I was dragged to this pathetic excuse for a horror film against my will and I really resent going. Anyone that rates this trash higher than a 3 is just plain uneducated on true horror. This is your typical, predictable Hollywood teen scream cash grab littered with plot holes, poor acting, no audience participation, and zero character development. I've broken down my gripes into numbered thought points.1. ZERO CRITICAL THINKING. I can't stand when the audience isn't challenged to think a little, especially with a horror where getting into someone's head can be so effective if done correctly. A good horror movie has elements that force you to think, whether it be about the scene or the character. There was no critical thinking involved whatsoever in this movie. Everything is just spoon fed to you so you know EXACTLY what is about to happen, which is EXACTLY what a horror movie is not supposed to be; predictable.2. Weak scene interpretation. The psychological aspects to this movie that allowed the audience to think about the meaning of a scene we're pretty weak and add to my first point of zero critical thinking. Everything was so one dimensional.3. Really. Bad. Acting. The only remotely good acting I witnessed was from veteran actor John Lithgow and one scene involving Rachel, the mother. That's it. Everyone else acted as if it was their first movie.4. Poor character development. Developing a character is so important in a horror. It sets a tone for how you're to feel about them so that when something happens to them, you feel something. If a character dies that wasn't properly developed, you don't feel the way you're supposed to about it. In this case, I felt nothing when Ellie died because they couldn't care less about making sure they planted a seed in your head. Granted she ends up being a vengeful zombie in the end but initially she is just a 9 year old girl who died tragically, and I felt nothing. While we're on the subject of characters, what was the point of Gage's character? The little boy that added literally no value to the movie. He just...existed. You can totally remove his character from the movie and nothing about the story would change. His character was absolutely useless and really only got in the way of the story most of the time.5. Jump scares. Omg the jump scares are incessant in this movie. Aren't jump scares getting a little old? Stop scaring us with loud noises and scare us with dread! I'm so sick of horror movies relying on jump scares to carry it. It's lazy.6. Cheesy effects. This may be nit picking a bit but...low lying ground fog? Really Paramount? I know this is an 80s reboot but come on. Ground fog?! I can't remember the last movie that had ground fog in it. I think it was an episode of Goosebumps in the 90s. And disappearing apparitions? Seriously? Sooo lame.In conclusion, I would not waste your money on this junk. If you really feel the need to see it, just don't. Instead, watch a REAL horror like The Ritual or Hereditary",Pet Sematary

There are some great actors in this film but that doesn't save the film. The atmosphere and palpable dread of the original masterpiece certainly doesn't manifest in the remake and really seems like a movie made for the box office on the recent success of the IT reboot.

They also changed the plot to make the young girl the main villian just like all those The Ring clones that were popular in the early 2000's.Seriously, the best actor in this movie is the cat, way nicer than the original and more unpredictable in its reactions. Jason Clarke is mediocre as usual and only John Lithgow shines in the few scenes he's in.In my opinion, they tried too hard to be IT but that remake is the exception to the rule.

668,DudesTheWord1,Did they read the book?,3,11 April 2019,"So I know the story, I've read and seen it several times, yet as I watched I began questioning everything that is true.
I get it. Remakes are designed to bring in a new audience (money) and piss off fans of the original. This one, in particular, was done horribly. I expected more suspense and thrills than what I got. The effects were bland and expected and ordinary. When you have a story like this, making changes can be a slippery slope, and nothing they did made it better, but tore it apart. At least they didn't change the character names, which, now that I think about it, might have been better if a new family had moved into the house; but what to do about Judd?
The sound effects, score, and the cute kitties who played Church were the best elements of the movie. John Lithgow as Judd was also a good choice, and the twins playing Gage were uncannily similar looking to the actor in the original. But these few things didn't make up for the missed elements or even the overplayed ones. The cover of Pet Sematary by the Ramones was dreadful, too. Oh, I almost forgot, I liked the funeral procession of children wearing masks, taking the dog to the Pet Sematary was a nice touch, and added something macabre.
When the ending finally came, I rolled my eyes and groaned. It was too much. All these things I've mentioned (and more), describe how the creators of this film gaslighted me. But guess what? I know the truth, that's not really what happened. Ask anyone. They'll tell a completely different story than what they tried to manipulate into my mind.
I highly recommend that you pretend it wasn't made and move on with your life.",Pet Sematary

Graded ""Super F""!",1,21 March 2021,"I just watched the ending of the film on Netflix, the main characters but the boy, Gage, are now one big and unhappy undead family. Let's summarize the latter part of the trash story. The worse situation started with the digging of the corpse of Louis' daughter out of the grave and buried in a pet cemetery. The bad spirit rises his daughter from the dead and becomes a terrible antagonist who killed Rachel. Then at one point, Louis is impaled by a recently undead Rachel and unfortunately killed. The fate of the poor boy, Gage, is unknown. This is how the film ends terribly bad, with no solutions and good conclusions.If Louis didn't dig his daughter's corpse out of the grave, I would've saved about 35 minutes of my life and the film would have a good ending with possible solutions.Typically, some horror films, have either bad endings or even worse than those, which is blatantly absurd. A typical story should have a good solution to the climax and at least a good conclusion. I first criticized in terms of bad endings was 12 Monkeys (1995), which is a science fiction film.For the record, I would give the film a ZERO sum or even subzero if there's an option.

671,aaronburley-43699,Just another remake.,3,30 June 2019,"Pet Sematary is another in a long line of Stephen King book-to-film remakes with once again the original film performing better than the latest modern adaptation.The film heavily relies on bloody imagery and jumpscares in order to scare the viewer. Everything this remake does the original did far better when it comes to actually trying to make a good film instead of being an easy cashgrab after the new IT film was so popular with audiences.The look of the film is also quite generic, the typical colour grading of dark blue during night scenes etc. The music is fairly unremarkable (except the end credits music which is just a lounder version of the original) with cheap jumpscare violins and loud sudden shocks that feel lazy and get very annoying at times.The rating I gave it was only justified by it being an interesting concept that intruiged me quite a bit, the ability to bring back dead loved ones only for them to come back as something far much worse with knowledge no one should have is an incredibly haunting thing.

He messed up when he buried church and messed up when his conscience convinced him not to give demonic church the lethal injexfion, resulting in Ellie going into the road, his wife being murdered and ultimately his own demise. This is something the original did not emphasize on. What I wasn't really impressed with in this film were the takes on Judd and Pascow. Judd didn't have that new England Maine/Boston hybrid accent and seemed weak. I would feel more safe around original Judd. Pascow lacked dialogue, I didn't like the one word sequences he mainly had; preferred the oroginal. I think this one was definitely more suspenseful and entertaining compared to the original and has an excellent ending paving the way for a potential sequel if the right story can be put together.

The book asks us a question: does something really exist on the other side? Or is just a one-way trip? If something exists, what can happen if they come back to us?
The atmosphere of the film is a typical suspense film: remote area, poor colors and scary neighbor, but somehow, it is to the point, as I could feel this vile atmosphere while sitting in the cozy cinema.
The film makes a big accent of the things we were afraid as children, and I, personally, find it great, definitely worth watching, and remember never to cross the line!

It was well acted (besides Louis), kinda cheesy, not very scary, and just kinda more on the okay side. Wasn't as bad as I originally thought.This movie, I'm glad to say, is an improvement. The acting is better, the characters are better developed (aside from Jud, sadly, but I will get into that later) and it was not nearly as cheesy. Plus, it does something new. However, for all the improvements it has over the original it has it's fair share of problems.It's always better to start off with the good, so let's do that. For one, the acting is almost all very solid. The only actor that could of used some work is the actress who played Ellie Creed, although she did get better as the movie went on. The next thing that can be applauded is the movies production design and overall most of the movie aspects In that regard were solid. The sets looked great, the makeup looked good, the music was great, along with the sound design. the cinematography was creepy and the movie overall was very well shot. I liked the color pallete. It felt like it belonged with the rest of the movie.the atmosphere was good too. It was all well done in those aspects. Also, the characters dialogue for the most part was well written. Also, certain characters were vastly improved over the original. Rachel's sister was very well developed and I enjoyed her addition to the movie and overall Rachel and her. Also, I liked most of the changes to the story. The new ending felt interesting, and I liked some of the story and character changes. One of my favorite changes from the original is the fact that Victor. He was annoying in the first movie, but his character is much more toned down and used well. His introduction could have been better though.Now some things that I feel could have used some work. For one, the character of Jud. He wasn't awful and his personality wasn't changed or anything, he was just greatly underdeveloped. I wish we got more of him, but he was underused and his character wasnt great. One thing that could have fixed tgis is just overall the movie being longer, but in the end this is one of the movies where I felt the run time was just too short. It was an hour and 40 minutes including credits, and there should have been more. Another of the movies problems was the scares themselves. While the movie did establish a good atmosphere, the movie was plagued by awful jumpscares that could have been so much better. Rachel's sister had the only effective jumpscares in the movie, besides for one involving one of the children. These jumpscares took away some of the tension the scene where they occured happened, and they always had that awful jumpscare queue sound effect. It brought down the movie at times and made it feel like a much more standard horror movie. Another of the movies problems is some of the script. While I said the dialogue was good, some of the plot points weren't great. One of the specifics is the ending, which could have used some work. The final minute or two is good and interesting and makes you question what is going to happen next, but one thing that happened in the ending felt lazy and I felt like the filmmakers could have changed something to take things a bit further in the ""wow they just did that"" factor.Other than those, most of my complaints are minor. It was an enjoyable movie with a sold cast, good soundtrack, and good directing. If I had to recommend on whether to see it in theaters or not, I would recommend maybe seeing it at a smaller theater that would not cost as much instead of going all out. In the end, it is either a 6 or a 7 out of 10. I can't decide.P.S: the advertisers need to be fired, as the trailers gave away way too much. Also

694,joleehyatt,A great remake,9,4 April 2019,"I had high expectations for this and I have to say it didn't disappoint. It was better than the original and I enjoyed some of the changes they made fro the source material, and original film.It made me jump in a few places and it was lovely to see John lithgow doing some fantastic acting. The little girl Ellie was also very good given her age and that cat is one grumpy sour-puss. (Pun intended)It would have been full stars if one actor in particular had been dropped as I really don't see how they contributed anything to the storyline. Won't point fingers, as I'm confident when you have seen the movie, you'll know who it is straightaway.Would watch again and recommend others to see it too.",Pet Sematary

I fall into that category of people who don't know the story. It was good I thought the build up was good the characters were good especially the little girl. It's a good horror film but nothing spectacular like some of their horror films that came out in the last year or so Like US or Hereditary. It's good for what it is and nothing more",Pet Sematary

I usually prefer a slower movie but the first hour of this flick drags by, with barely any noticeable differences from the original. Once the story picks up steam it's impossible to empathize with the characters, so you can't invest in the tension. Who lives, who dies, who cares?

Not a single aspect had that special aspect a film has that will leave me remembering it in the future. If you want to see a jam-packed jumpscare film for two hours go right ahead.

The plot was good enough, although the character development left a little to be desired in my opinion.The movie utilized some run-of-the-mill jump scares, which is to be expected. In the horror movie genre, I think it's really hard to have a kid as the main evil/bad guy, and this movie gave a good effort. This movie had a couple of minor plot holes that I got over pretty quickly. In the end, it was not incredibly scary, at least for horrorphiles like myself.

It felt like FOREVER to build up to the suspense and horror and then it happened so fast it was a let down. I truly did not understand the reason for Pascal's character and why he seemed to be heeding warnings but then pretty much terrorizes the toddler. There were scenes that never were elaborated on so you're left to wonder what the point of including it was for. I. Did. Not. Get. It.

I was very excited about the remake when I heard it was closer to the original story. However, I have had kids since then who are between the ages of the children in the movie, and it was a bad idea to watch it at all. The movie is well acted, the effects are convincing, and it flows smoothly. There is just enough characterization to give you investment in the characters, but no real depth or dimension. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the movie went by like a short story. It is hard to believe it was longer than 45 minutes.

712,renibilibok,"Sometimes, not remaking a movie is better.",2,26 December 2019,"Wow, I am extremely disappointed. I'm not here to praise the 1989 version, that one had some serious lacks too, but sometimes more is less, and sometimes adaptation should just stick to the novel, especially if it does not have anything, and I mean ANYthing meaningful to add. This movie seems like a commercial version of the - sometimes extremely - serious issues touched by the novel: like the unfounded guilt felt by Rachel for her sister's death (replaced here by actually pretty founded guilt), the psychosis of a terminal illness (touched, avoided), the inevitability of death and also, people's irrational, senseless fear of death as seen in Rachel (nothing but a flicker of thought, a 15-second dialogue in this movie).
Sometimes, slowly-built creep leads to a great scare, but here, the quick-changing scenery, the cuts of plot lines basically just open stories and leave it there (why did they have to make the children's pet funeral such a creep? it is explicitly stated in the novel that the pet 'sematary' is founded on the love and grief felt by children upon possibly their first real loss... it is nowhere near the satanist ritual seen here).
Also, I considered the choice of actors poor. All my respect to John Lithgow, but this role just wasn't for him. The only great casting choice was the cat.
*SPOILER*
I don't see the point of changing the subject of the major death in the movie. The original implicates so much more: the character development of the daughter (the one to learn eventually about the nature of death), the mercilessness of death which clearly has no respect for anything about whom it takes away...
A bonus eyesore: making the only black actor the dead guy (and also, taking away like 80% of the character's role) is so clearly aimed at being politically correct that it actually makes it even more politically incorrect.
This movie actually made me angry.
Both stars go for the cat.",Pet Sematary

714,marcellhernandes,Can be compared with the original,9,27 May 2019,"Good movie. The story is a bit different. It didn't make any difference for me that was the girl the one who died. Gage was cute and the cat disgusting. The young teen that died in the hospital is a black guy now. Maybe that's how they play diversity. Jud doesn't give deeper details about the graveyard and doesn't tell as many stories as he did in the original. That's a bit lame. We'd love to have more details about everything. He gets killed by the girl. The wife gets killed by the girl (who buries her) and the wife kills the husband (that just left Gage in the car). Both mom and daughter buried dad and now we have a full zombie family... Wait... Gage... Yeah, it's not shown, but they got the poor kid. I liked it better the way he died in the original, rather than slaughtered by his own undead family. I'd actually like to see a version where this little guy doesn't die in the end.Comparing both classic and modern movies, I'd say the classic is more emotional, focus a bit more on telling mode details about the graveyard (thus raising immersion). In the new one there's also more details about her sister's story and the trauma it generated.1 - Less details about the story1 - They saved Gage for no purpose. And they don't give much attention to Elle and Gage. So we don't care about them a lot. Just Gage, because he's cute.1 - Less emotion (there's a family there, so we should be feeling very sad for them, not just horrified by a zombie story)Not saying it's bad. It's not. Fun to watch. But kids could get a better development, just like the family itself. I'd watch again. I like the original better, overall, but the graphics surely put the new one ahead. The sound is also very good. I like the way the intro music sounds threatening. Puts in you in the mood for a real horror. Considering everything I could give 6 or 7. But I'll go 8, because despite all the problems, they focused on the horror, nasty visions and creepy visions. That's good enough for me.Original = sentimental horror
New Version = creepy horror",Pet Sematary
715,damon158,Still doesn't touch the original,7,13 April 2019,"This was certainly a slightly different take on the original. While the outline is very much the same, some small tweaks are noticed throughout and the ending, while different, definitely comes off as much weaker. I was leaning towards an 8, unfortunately the ending coupled with poor acting on the part of Amy Seimetz really drag down the movie. John Lithgow was great as to be expected and Jason Clarke does a great job as the lead, very believable. Pacing is perfect. All in all, a decent flick that I would recommend any fans of the original or King to at least check out, even if it is flawed.",Pet Sematary

This is not the cliché jump scare type of horror that has perverted the genre over the last decade or more. This is a true horror flick that will make you uncomfortable, sad, scared, and probably a bit disturbed as it goes on.

The mom was completely forgettable. The little girl was pretty awful, honestly, although I feel bad saying that about a child actor. With a kid that young, I blame the director mostly anyway, but yeah, she was a little too precious even before she went full zombie.I'm not clear why they left so much out of this one. It meandered so much more. They didn't have any of the tension with the wife's parents, which added an extra layer of horror / grief to the original. It didn't really work having an older kid die... the toddler thing was super creepy because toddlers aren't fully formed people yet, so they either love totally or go feral totally, which was much more affecting. They could have switched the ages of the kids (had the little girl be the toddler) and maybe that would have worked, but as it was, this was pretty terrible.I actually went back and watched the 1989 one after seeing this, just to compare the two.... I hadn't seen that version since it came out in the theater. It was SO MUCH better it was kind of shocking, honestly. Sure, it was schlocky and low-budget, like all horror movies were back in the 80s, but it was actually more affecting in terms of the emotional content. Fred Gwynne actually made a much better next door neighbor (and a much more sympathetic one). John Lithgow was kind of creepy from the beginning in the role for some reason, which was an odd choice.In all, yeah, not well made. Didn't emotionally connect. They didn't seem to get the heart of why this story is so terrible and affecting, in terms of what the loss of a child does to a family.",Pet Sematary

Now, with that out of the way, I was expecting a very poor adaption of the original book and movie. I was wrong.
Yes, there are flaws, there are WTF moments when you'd go ""Why would you do that after ************ happened? Are you blind or insane?"" But there were a couple of jump scares that made me smile.
Some of the acting was flimsy, however, I enjoyed John Lithgow's performance and the little girl, Ellie, played by Jete Laurence, made up for it.
I was a bit disappointed with the somewhat lazy (IMHO) effects after the scene with the truck - the resulting trauma would have been massive, so I must credit the undertaker for his phenomenal skill at repairing what should have been a shattered human skull.
The scenes with the kids in the masks seem only to have been included to use as advertising material for the film because they added nothing to the movie whatsoever and were brushed over lightly before the film went on.
The cat(s) who played Church did a good job and honestly did better on more than one occasion than their human counterparts.
Victor Pascow really needed to work harder on his warnings - after all, Louis did try to save his life.
The ending was predictable and I imagine there's already a sequel being written but what film these days doesn't have one, or two or more? (I'm talking to you, Avengers.)
I went into this one expecting a rating of 3 after what I'd been hearing and if you're a true Stephen King fan, I understand why you would feel this way. I think the original is one of his better screen adaptions and if you haven't seen it, then this one really shouldn't disappoint but make an effort to watch the original too - it's worth it, despite even it's problems.

The plot of the film does not make you at all heavy, it is a very moved one with many very good changes of plane. the edition was perfect in some parts and also helped to understand very well the references they wanted to give and they changed something about the film that in the 1989 one was essential but they changed that part and they were perfect because you don't expect what is going at all to pass and you are very amazed. (when they see it or if they saw it they will understand me) if they improved the script it was an 8 to my regret.The BAD thing in the film is very little to my taste it has almost the same substitutes (screamers) that in the original bone they put new but very few, I also do not like that the cat is not all black as in the original film but that is already tastes mine and what subtracts many points from the film was the script.

As time passed and more and more reviews of it surfaced, I grew ever increasingly reluctant to see it, even when it became available for rent on satellite television.One evening, however, my wife suggested that I pay tribute to my initial excitement and commit to a viewing in order to at least make up my own mind and not rely entirely on others' subjective views. Having indulged her with cautious optimism, I ended up switching it off halfway through.I'll steer clear of lengthy lamenting and briefly state that I was taken out of the experience from early on in the runtime. From serious pacing problems, poor writing (and even acting), to the children's Halloween party-esque makeup worn by one of the characters who's come ""back"" from the cemetery. It was just excruciating.So far, the 1989 original - not completely devoid of its own problems - in my opinion, still holds up to this day and serves as a chilling story of horror and drama that is palpable and unsettling even by contemporary standards.

They did an excellent job at making Zelda look horrifying, but what's with making her go down a food elevator?! How or why!? What about the scary fast rise from the bed as she twist her back and face around and calls out at her sister? You'll get none of that with this new remake. I give it 1 star because the only creative things they did was kill off Ellie and weren't creative with her coming back to life in a spooky way.

I gave this movie a 10 to help raise it's rating. It is probably 7- 7.2 or 7.3/10, honestly..especially if the cheesy and horribly acted 1989 Pet Sematary movie is a 6.6/10 like it's rated. Lol. The acting in this film alone makes it a better film than the 1989 movie and especially better than it's absolutely horrendous 1992 sequel. The 1989 movie strayed away from the book as well. If you think otherwise, then you just simply haven't read the book. This 2019 Pet Sematary movie strayed away from the book in a few ways (the switch with which kid dies, not enough Timmy Baterman at all, the ending, and a couple of other smaller ways) but it was also pretty faithful in more ways than not if you really read the book well and I would say that it was overall more faithful to the book than 1989 movie was. I mean, just for one small example is CUJO was mentioned in this 2019 movie just like he's mentioned in the book. The Wendigo from the book is actually in this one. Norma Crandall (Jud's Wife) is actually mentioned in this one and seen briefly as well. None of that can be said for the 1989 movie. I mean, back from the dead Ellie, in this new movie, was closer to the book version of Gage than the 1989 movie version of Gage is..in both looks and behavior. And that's saying something since well, ya know, SHE'S A GIRL ! I think Pet Sematary 2019 Pet Sematary is an overall better film than 1989 Pet Sematary. The acting is better, the production is better, it's overall more faithful to the book even with the changes, etc etc....I'm sorry, but it's the truth. I hope this movie gets the prequel (that this movie's Directors are wanting to direct) about a young Jud and his Wife, Norma..as well as Timmy Baterman and his Father, Bill Baterman.

There were few elements in the film that I liked but sadly even more elements that I strongly disliked - like the cheap jumpscares and the overall weird and uncoordinated relationship between the characters. Speaking of characters, what the hell was that with Louis Creed? He had no backstory and was a total miss for me. And Zelda also seemed a bit random. I cant really point a finger at what is making the movie so bad for me - because I think its kind of everywhere. I think if they only waited a bit more and put more thought in it - it could have been a good film. So overall, would I recomend it? Not really. Is it the worst movie?

I was hopeful this new taken on the Stephen King novel would be good, but it fell entirely too flat. 1.) No one will ever match the eerieness of Fred Gwynn in the original. Lithgow does his best with what he is given. However, the friendship between Jud and Louis is mostly disregarded here. There is next to no character development. 2.) The tension between Louis and Rachel is lacking. 3.) The scariest part of the original for me was Zelda. Here, she is just plain LAME. Not scary at all. 4.) The atmosphere is superficial and it doesn't give a real sense of terror and agony that this family should be going through. 5.) The ending was just awful. Too rushed and in no way did it pack the same punch as the original. Spoiled twist or not. It was bad. 6.) Pascow- I don't know why they even bothered including him. I have to give them props, however, for finding an actress to play Ellie who wasn't totally grating on the ears and soul. She was the bright spot in this movie.

I could not say the same about the original movie which I think is overrated.Bad reviews of all remakes seems to be trendy. Perhaps because people being all nostalgic with the original movie they know and perhaps many of the new movies actually try to hit some nostalgic elements to get a greater general appeal (the Jurassic Park movies etc). This movie did not do that. The general outline of the story in the first half of the movie was pretty much the same as the original. Then the story has a little twist which changes the rest of the story onward.Don't listen to the extreme bad reviews. Give the movie a go and make up your own mind.,Pet Sematary

The film does't bother with character building very much,it's typical modern horror,""Lets get to the nasty stuff"". Problem is the film has lost the atmosphere of the original,it's not scary anymore. Pascow the ghost is all whispery,appearing in mist and make no wonder Louis ignores him;he's no longer the apparation of doom from the original. WHen things go belly up there are glimpses of creepy unsettling scenes,Louis with Ellie in the bath and on the bed for instance but then a dumb scene with zombie Ellie dancing is just ridiculous.As per most modern horror it relies on jump scares too much instead of creeping dread,and turns into a slasher movie toward the end.

The ""twists"" don't really add anything to the film.
The remake in employing these twists to distinguish itself between the original film only succeeds in defining itself by the parameters of the original instead of making the story it's own.
The story is rushed. The family is never made sympathetic or likeable. The Dr. never really tried to help Pascow, and the writers have obviously never visited an actual ER.

Where a family moves to a new house and of course things go awry.However, there were no Supernatural happenings when they first move in. Basically it was bad luck and bad advice that led them down the dark path that they end up on.I would also like to point out, that it's very rare for a movie to have an A story and a B story going on at the same time. It's a popular plot device used quite often on TV shows but very rare for film. If and when you see the film, you will understand what I'm talking about.Stephen King sites this work as the only one to truly scare himself. Was I truly scared when watching, know if it happened to me, HELL yes. The best analogy I can give you; if you know the classic tale of the monkey's paw, then you know how this is going to go.The imagery and cinematography were on point and they definitely had a good creep factor.

The original version is a whole lot better, this version is a little different than the original. It was dumb why they had to change the end when the neighbor got killed and was seeing his dead wife. I would definitely would not watch this again or buy it on Blu Ray, it sucked as these other remakes that Hollywood trying to get out. THE ORIGINAL IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS REMAKE!

807,angus4625,Should HAVE KNOWN BETTER!,3,2 July 2019,"I really only watched this unnecessary re-telling of this Stephen King Classic because I knew that John Lithgow was performing in it. I regard him as one of the best character actors of my generation.
However, I have to admit that Fred Gwynn's performance personified the character of Jud so much better, but then again, an actor can only do as well as the screenwriters interpretation. So, my apologies to all of the actors and actresses that starred in this needless remake.
If you thought the acting was bad in the first Pet Semetary (which I did not!) then you will hate this version. It is redundant, unnecessary and not even close to the original in for example: it's ORIGINALITY !!! Come up with some original material HOLLYWOOD, it's not that hard!!
So, watch if you will, and be a brainless sheep and expect no original thoughts,screenplays, stories, education or anything else from the generation that apparently is completely satisfied with a remake of ""BatMan"" every couple of years to keep them satisfied. My apologies also go out to the brilliant mind of Mr. Stephen King, he is very generous to even let his name be associated with this re-make of one of his classics.
The only reason it gets 3/10 stars is because I truly think that the cast of actors did the best they could with the writing and directing that they received.",Pet Sematary

809,irotinmyskin-1,Garbage.,1,5 April 2019,"I just saw it and i hated it. Whenever it tried to do something different it did but for the worse.My biggest issues are :
We never saw Ellie really care about Church, so Jud suggesting to bury the cat in the Indian cemetery doesn't make sense. The parents taking Rachel and Gage doesnt make sense since we dont see the conflict between them, blaming Louis for the death of Gage. We never see Louis regret bringing Ellie back, where in the original one having Louis kill little Gage is as powerful as it can be, he has to take the life of his child with his own hands, and then just to see him commit the same mistake again with Rachel and ultimately paying with his life.
In this one what? their ultimate goal is to be ... a family of...zombies? huh? what?
Not to mention practical effects, make up on the teenager who got killed looked more like a mutant/burnt victim than an accident. Trailer crash was laughable, Ive seen youtubers pull better green screens than that. After Ellie has been killed by this huge truck all she has is.... a lazy eye? wtf... seriously?

815,Meta_B,A Series Better Dead,5,7 April 2019,"What has competent cinematography, a headscratching twist, questionable writing, and made me pretty pissed?Pet Sematary 2019!To be frank, this movie is not bad. The opening moments were well-made and provided some visual intrigue, so long as you haven't read the book or seen the previous film. Or Kujo. Or most modern horror movies.It pains me to see such promise and have the potential squandered.
Okay..Let's start from the beginning. Pet Sematary suffers from the age-old problem of polishing an old car with new wax. To restore the old is an admirable goal but if your efforts are only skindeep, you may find yourself driving a shiny lemon.
From the get-go, red flags are all around us. Our opening shot gives away the story before we even set eyes on the family. No matter what follows, we know the results which, if you're keeping this in mind throughout the film, undercuts the tension of most scenes and can quickly lead to frustration. If it weren't for the content of the scene, it'd be an interesting stylistic choice. And this, in essence, is my issue throughout.Competent acting and shot composition (if a little bland at times) is wasted on poor narrative decisions. Specifically the arc of Louis, he feels like he goes from a likeable, even-headed parental figure into an illogical, half-baked protagonist.As the nihilist in me would say, ""Everyone dies, no one learns anything, life goes on.""

While I appreciate the creative license in trying to change the story up, it was done in such a bland and boring manner. Having Ellie instead of Gage come back was not scary at all: there's a reason why Chucky is so terrifying, because little people fit into little places. Also, Ellie's super human ninja powers made us crack up that we almost peed our pants. Pascow's makeup looked worse/less believable than it did 30 years ago.

839,chuckwes-38773,I highly recommend that you pretend it wasn't made and move on with your life.,1,7 April 2019,"Gaslighting is manipulating someone by psychological means into questioning their sanity. That is how Pet Sematary (2019) made me feel; not to single out this film, most remakes make me feel this way. I know the story, I've read and seen it several times, yet as I watched I began questioning everything that is true.
I get it. Remakes are designed to bring in a new audience (money) and piss off fans of the original. This one, in particular, was done horribly. I expected more suspense and thrills than what I got. The effects were bland and expected and ordinary. When you have a story like this, making changes can be a slippery slope, and nothing they did made it better, but tore it apart. At least they didn't change the character names, which, now that I think about it, might have been better if a new family had moved into the house; but what to do about Judd?
The sound effects, score, and the cute kitties who played Church were the best elements of the movie. John Lithgow as Judd was also a good choice, and the twins playing Gage were uncannily similar looking to the actor in the original. But these few things didn't make up for the missed elements or even the overplayed ones. The cover of Pet Sematary by the Ramones was dreadful, too. Oh, I almost forgot, I liked the funeral procession of children wearing masks, taking the dog to the Pet Sematary was a nice touch, and added something macabre.
When the ending finally came, I rolled my eyes and groaned. It was too much. All these things I've mentioned (and more), describe how the creators of this film gaslighted me. But guess what? I know the truth, that's not really what happened. Ask anyone. They'll tell a completely different story than what they tried to manipulate into my mind.",Pet Sematary

This is a pretty standard modern cash grab cliché horror remake that had the chance to be something very intense and well executed that was just kind of there . There are parts of the story that are expanded on but huge parts that were not expanded on that have left me very disappointed . The acting is definitely there and somewhat consistently delivered as well as the camera work but overall the film drags way too much . I was surprised they went the route they did with the shocking ending and will give it some credit for that .

It turned out to actually be good. The 1989 film was more gore based and its story wasn't really there besides the whole saying 'Sometimes dead is better' being mentioned every two seconds. This film has so many foreshadowing and stakes that its a perfect movie in my opinion.The remake actually focuses on the characters emotions, they actually give time for some character development unlike the 1989 film. The jump-scares in this movie is not what you are wanting to see because if you are then you are picking the wrong film as its too rich for you because its more story based (Just like the book). Go see a cheap ghost horror film or something. Pet Sematary 2019 is a perfect example of a remake, it reworks some parts of the story and restructures some scenes that were in the original.

This really was a class act, we had him in Aftermath and now this. His on screen presence is so underplayed that you don't notice the skills he applies to the micro-gestures and fleeting emotions he conveys with the eyes.The neighbour, played by John Lithgow was masterfully realised, solid as a rock here and the wife played by Amy Seimetz was the icing on the cake.

I'm a huge fan of the novel, and whilst I'm well aware a certain amount of artistic licence goes into putting a book onto the big screen, they changed so much of the story that it was barely recognisable. I understand why they changed which child was killed, you'd be hard pushed to find a toddler that can act as the living dead, but it didn't work with the older child either. In the book, the resurrected 'being' was taken over by a demon-in the film, Ellie is well aware she is dead, and she's living an unwanted 'afterlife' of which she is also aware, and it turns her evil. There is no atmosphere in the film, the setting should be creepy and atmospheric, but I'll be honest, the scenes in the woods look very much like a stage set with dry ice covering the floor.

A jumpscare you wait is the jumpscare that scares you in the end.The ending where Ellie went on the killing spree was kinda disappointing, at that point I didn't know if I was watching Pet Sematary or the new and upcoming Chucky movie. She cussed way too much and was just so much Chucky -like, but still the kills were pretty nicely made so it kinda pays off. In the older movie, the killer was funny because he was clumsy and cute and you know, a 3-year-old, but in this one she was a young 9-year-old lady who called her mother a Useless Cow and was mad because her mother didn't help her on the road when she got hit by the truck.Was also disappointed that the Jud scene where he and Lois drank a little and watched the trucks go by wasn't in this. It was one of my favourite scenes in the old adaptation. (But this is just a personal preferation)Also, loved the fact that we got to hear a little about the backstory of the Sematary, and that the kids who made the ritual got into the movie.I rate Pet Sematary (2019) 9/10, it was amazing but not perfect.",Pet Sematary

The creepy vibe is maintained throughout, with two or three well executed jump scares. The ending is unforgettable. Jason Clarke is spectacular as Louis. Amy Seimetz is outstanding as Rachel. John Lithgow is amazing as Jud. Jete Lawrence is the star of the show, as Ellie. Twins Hugo & Lucas Lavoie are adorable as Gage. Obyssa Ahmed is fantastic as Victor Pascow.

The original played on our need, as humans, to be the protectors of our children and to be in control of that mortality. The original feels tense and chaotic, you can feel Louis's frustration and confusion and anger as he struggles to deal with his son's death.I know WHY they made the switch to Ellie dying, because she's the older child and therefore can take direction a lot better than a toddler. The actress did a fantastic job, she was so creepy. As a matter of fact, all the actors did an amazing job.I wish that newbie directors would just lay off the remakes. This would've been an excellent film to pay homage to that wasn't a remake. The original came out in 1989, it could've been a new family that moved onto the property where a newer house was built with a neighbor who'd lived there long enough to have heard rumors about the previous owners of the Creed house and the Crandall house.It could've been SO GOOD.",Pet Sematary

Louis was portrayed as very cold, but that's not the way the source material has him. You don't really understand why they had to move or why it was better for them to slow down as they said. The relationship between Louis & Judd was not really displayed well. There was a bond between the two that could've easily been shown to show why we are going down this path. Finally, the switching from the youngest child to the eldest child was completely unnecessary. There's something far creepier having a two year old silent killing zombie and a fully talking 9 year old killing zombie.What I really did like was the intensity of Rachel and her sister. It was very well done and you really understood why this weighs on her mind so heavily.All in all was a decent movie, but had the potential of being so much more.",Pet Sematary

So you have an overall boring story with a few strong scenes. The ending also fails to impress, and it's pretty predictable. They added a lot of new stuff to the original story with an idea to make it more suspenseful, but miserably failed. As an example of its lack of professionalism, I can give you that: a 20 year old gets hit by a car and his body is destroyed, a 9 year old gets hit by a semi and there's no damage to her body.

874,NayanKumar,Dead Pets Society,6,6 April 2019,"I had a basic understanding of the plot before seeing the movie, however this is the first time I have actually been exposed to any 'Pet Sematary' material.Let's start with the good. The story is good and told in a decent manner. The acting was good on the most part. Although I like watching John Lithgow, and he played a kind, sweet, lonely man very well, I didn't feel like he had the right portrayal as a vulnerable, old man. But overall a decent movie.Now the bad. There wasn't a great deal of character development or bakcstory. The pet sematary was introduced early and, even though we get flashbacks, we don't see much of what motivates the characters, apart from a few glimpses. Next are things I spotted that I felt weren't clear or answered:
1) It seemed they didn't really know what they were buying when they bought the house - poor planning or rush move?
2) The young man, Victor, who is hit by a car early in the movie looked like mince meat, but his daughter, Ellie, who was hit by a tanker just ends up with a few stitches in her head? This might be right, but as they didn't show the car crash or the impact with Ellie, I find it hard to believe the difference in aftermath.
3) Why was Victor even 'haunting' him? I get it must be to do with the house, but this wasn't really explained.
4) Why would Jud think resurrecting Church would be a better idea than getting a new cat? There seemed no hesitation, even after his own experience.
5) When Judge does come back and they discover him in the closet, it looked like he was covered in some blood and acting strange, yet the mother doesn't bat an eyelid.Maybe I need a 2nd viewing, which may answer these point's. Anyway, overall, the movie was good, some decent acting, and was a decent horror flick.",Pet Sematary
875,Chadstermac,Forgettable Remake,5,28 June 2019,"Same exact story with a few twists. Tries to make you jump by sudden overly loud sound volume increases. Just one example of how the movie was just rushing through a check box of all the current rated R, but should be rated PG-13 Horror Clichés that seem to be plaguing this; yet another Hollywood cash in on another classic. Although I knew going into it, and make me a little biased, I'm rather tired of children/doll villains in every horror movie that comes out these days. So Overdone. Also, didn't really seem as logical or believable being set in modern times. Pacing (especially near the end) felt rushed, and character development was so much better in the first one in my opinion. The mothers tragic Side Story seemed to detract from the original plot, and rather pointless. I really don't see how it was a stretch for the writers or actors here.

However after watching it I must say that I liked it even a bit more. It improved the original in terms of suspense by using better cinematography, a more effective soundtrack and created a darker visual style that emphasized the morbidness of using some form of necromancy to reunite back together with your dead child.
The little changes that where done to the story also where an overall good decision in my opinion especially regarding the end which was much better than in the original's.
To everyone sceptical like me about reboots especially since the recent string of failures by Hollywood I can recommend giving this a shot if you liked Pet Cemetery. And those who didn't see the original or read the book: It's an above average horror movie especially thanks to it's relatable story and characters and thanks to a morbid yet awesome ending.",Pet Sematary

897,lichtenstein-16338,"Almost dethrones the originial, but falls apart at the very end.",7,21 June 2019,"I actually like the risk they took with making Ellie the victim rather than Gage. She is very well cast and portrays the perfect, pretty little innocent daughter which makes it that much more tragic when she is the one killed.
This movie improves on a lot of aspects of the original. When Ellie first comes back from the dead, her father's cathartic response at seeing his pretty daughter again is very effective, and it is also nice that she talks and acts somewhat like Ellie, instead of being this killing machine like Gage in the original (which worked very well in its own right).
So the movie does a lot of things well, but the climax doesn't make any sense and kind of ruined it for me. Its as if they had a more disturbing, effective ending but they had to cut it out to make the movie more palatable for mainstream audiences so that they are now all one ""happy zombie family"".
Good horror movies don't need a silver lining. There was an opportunity to hit home with the psychological horror aspect and make this movie better than the original, but they missed that opportunity, and the way Gage is portrayed after coming back in the original leaves a stronger lasting impression, than the tepid vanilla ending of this one.
Would have been more interesting if Gage is also killed and they form a brother-sister zombie duo, kill the mother, and Louis either buries her like in the original or runs away from that place and never returns to Pet Sematary.",Pet Sematary

It's genuinely creepy and was able to hold my attention late last night. I seriously think it's one of the better horror movies made in the last year. I wouldn't say it's better than the first one, but it's a good remake. Even though it's just a remake, they did a good job with it and put their own little spin on it. I saw the original in the 90s and still think it's one of the scariest movies I've seen. That being said, the bar was set impossibly high from the start and my expectations for this were low. I was ready to hate on it too, but I cannot find anything bad to really say about it. The makeup effects were practical which made it extra gross and disturbing. You could've told me this came out a long time ago and I'd believe it since there's hardly any cheesy CGI. There are at least 3 good jump scares. For the most part it's pretty much the same as the original. Don't trust all the negative reviews. If you liked the first one, definitely give this one a chance.

About the horror part, somes scenes were grotesque and there were a lot of jumpscares and tension building, but I'm not going to spoil anything.Final thoughts: I didn't watch any trailers and from what I could see, most complaints came from people who have watched them. Also, I find it laughable that a weak slasher movie like ""Us"" gets a better rating than this movie, which in my opinion, is way, way better.Veredict: I'd say ""Pet Sematary"" is at least a solid 8, but I gave it a 9 because I strongly disagree with the current 7.0 rating.",Pet Sematary
918,rohiethnp,Very disappointing and frustrating.,2,7 April 2019,"My opinion is based on what plays out in this movie. I am not comparing it to the excellent book. Because I don't think that that is fair.SPOILERS:I will get straight into it:I didn't like this movie at all.The biggest part where this movie fails for me, is that you don't feel any connection or emotional feeling with the characters. There isn't one moment, one scene in this movie where I thought 'I really hope this family stays together', or 'survive through these situations', or 'get redemption'. Not one.When the cat dies Louis sais: ""Ellie really loves/loved Church"". WHAT!?? Where was that shown? You all forgot the cat in the car in the opening scene, for crying out loud!! Just because you're telling me, doesn't mean I am immediately emotionally invested. No. Just no.Then there's the moment with the neighbour. The first interaction is Jud helping out Ellie, when she wanders off to Pet Semetary when she sees some kids in masks walking(which btw is never resolved), Rachel comes and takes Ellie away. She doesn't even thank Jud for helping out Ellie? WHY!? This would have been a perfect moment for the two people to know each other, and get some inside information about the characters. But no. We just have to believe that these characters will care for each other.Then there is the scene where Jud takes Louis and deceased Church to the place beyond Pet Semetary. There isn't any build up or mystery shown. He just takes him there, Louis ask some mysterious questions: ""What is this place, Jud?"" ""What did we really do, Jud?"". The same thing as what I previously stated: if you just tell me, I will not be invested! Because you have never talked about this place, there is no mystery, not any build up. It's just like in the adaption from 1989 where things happen and the audience just have to roll with it. It just doesnt work movie-wise.There is also something that happened in Rachel's past and her sister, but also this isn't fleshed out well. Something that could've been very eerie and could've added to the mystery of the movie, is just there for idiotic jump scares.Then there's the death of Ellie. Something that has to be emotional and have a huge impact on the audience, is served as something that could've been from a big action movie directed by Zack Snyder.One last thing: I understand that pacing is important in movies, so there isn't much time to explain everything. But if you take the important things that matter, flesh it out, you can make a very strong story, I mean the characters are there, the story is there. It is already written. The only thing left to to do is film it.The only thing that I liked is the way the ending resolves. With Ellie burying the mom, her attacking the father and then they all go to Gage to kill him and bury him at that place which we never find anything about.But if could've been so much better if I was invested in the characters and the mystery.1,5 star out of 5. 2 stars out of 10.

That scene in the book was devastating, but that did not come through in this movie..Everything moved way too fast, and many many key points were left out.
Why can't they just leave bad enough alone?",Pet Sematary

925,ryanmcdonagh-89263,Breaking what isn't Broken,5,4 April 2019,"This film was such a dissapointment. I am a huge Steven King fan and this film is a butching of the source material changing major plot points and small ones. You dont need to stick completely to the book with an adaption but the fact that IT done so well sticking to its source you would think they would take inspiration from this to do the same. This film relies on jump scares for most of the film rather then spend time on building up real tention. The acting isnt too bad but their actions make little sense.(SPOILER)
A large part of the story and the book is the main character, the fathers, slow decline into madness and denial in a horror setting, not being able to adjust and stand the guilt and greieving of his child that die halfway through the plot repeating his mistakes. This film not only gets rid of this sympathetic character with plot changes such as drugging and change of which child dies, but also makes the end of the film a video game boss fight where any connection to the characters be them now antagonists is gone.",Pet Sematary
926,ochirooorgilon,Enjoyed this remake,9,11 April 2019,"Well, most of us know that this one is the remake of its original version which was released in 1989. The acting and effects are definitely better as you could expect. Furthermore, this movie still manages to be exciting and the tragedy scenes hit you really hard. Also, I found out that theme of death and grief were explored well in either original or remake ones.
For me, the original version was much creepier and completely linked with a novel by Stephen King. However, this remake one presented some lame jump scares, not creepy at all. Even though, I enjoyed this film very well.",Pet Sematary
927,ivanrogar,Horrible - not in a good way,3,14 April 2019,"Sloppy direction, dreadfully bad script, beyond cringe-worthy ending, stinky cheap CG and unconvincing digital photography.

The original movie is literary Oscar worthy material compared to this one. Hard pass. Avoid at all cost.",Pet Sematary
928,ljlis,"Entertaining, but nothing special",6,8 April 2019,"I have not seen the original; and therefore, went into the movie with minimal bias (my significant other really enjoyed the original and was giving it much praise).The film was overall entertaining, and I always enjoy a movie that implements a ""hidden world"" to our planet, but there was nothing particularly groundbreaking, original, or thought-provoking in it.
For some, the jump scares and fun ride are enough to warrant it being a ""good"" film, but I just felt like I've experienced this a million times before and nothing really stood out to me - not even the cinematography was particular great to me. Maybe this is just out of my preferred genre and I'm overly critical, but all-in-all this was just an ""okay"" use of my leisure and I don't really recommend it to anyone other than fans of the original or fans of Stephen King's work (in which his novels are fantastic!).",Pet Sematary
929,mariadmaury,Original is better,2,6 April 2019,This is why you cannot remake a classic movie. The original had more detail and was scarier in my opinion. A lot of details were missed and flashbacks of the characters past tense story's were not carried out through as the original.,Pet Sematary
930,vlaado7,The ending ruined the movie,7,14 April 2019,"I personally don't like to watch horror movies but I watched a trailer for this movie and it looked awesome. The movie itself is quite scary and full of mysteries. The animal masks, the van jumpscares and some giant plot twists really fullfill the movie experience. The jumpscares were so scary and so well-made. The background music made it even scarier. The characters are perfect for the movie and acted so well that it made me raise the rating for the movie. What I didn't like was the ending. It was so fastened and everything finished so quickly that I couldn't quite catch up everything so that might be the reason why the rating is lower.",Pet Sematary
931,isabelhornblower,What is wrong with today's horror,2,4 April 2019,"I won't do any comparison with the old movie, I love the idea of changing a story to make something new. Sadly, the story has no point, it is going nowhere and events seem to be randomly taken out from a hat.
I see the same mistakes here as in the other recent horror films. They try to scare us with any situation that is not even about the actual threat. That is annoying and diminished the effect when we should actually be scared!
At a certain point, the father started jumping from one emotion to another without coherence so I couldn't feel any empathy for him because it felt anything but realistic behavior (considering the events taking place).
The story started normally, and then it spiralled down into something that screamed : ""Hey! Looked at me! I am creepy right? Come on, tell me I am scary! Tell me I am original!"" But no it has all been seen before and you don't create a story by choosing ""scary scenes"" and try to put them together to create a story. It is not even creppy. There is many ways to be twisted and scary and I would like a horror movie that tries something else than just fog, darkness and enemies acting the same way.
A hand of applause for the young actress who did really good. I don't like the way the character was written in the end, but she did great with that!This movie is forgetable. When a movie is bad, I often recommend it just to get a good laugh out of it. I don't recommend this one, it is not even worth a laugh.",Pet Sematary
932,kylekjerstad,This is such a disappointment,5,7 April 2019,"Growing up watching the original films and reading the book, I felt totally cheated here.This is not good at all, I would never suggest it to anyone.

Please just leave these films alone.",Pet Sematary
933,GG-Royal,Polarizing but I liked it,7,19 April 2019,"I can absolutely understand the polarizing opinions on this remake of ""Pet Sematary"" and even support most of the arguments mentioned about why this is supposedly a bad horror film, but I couldn't stop loving this experience anyway. As a huge fan and frequent defender of Stephen King's original novel, I have been looking forward to Dennis Widmyer and Kevin Kölsch's take on this classic horror story for quite some time, especially since I can't pretend being a huge fan of the first cinematic adaptation of ""Pet Sematary"" from 1989.First, let's begin with the casting. Nobody could possibly replace Fred Gwynne, who was quite frankly the best part about the first film. But if someone else has to portray Jud - and since Gwynne sadly passed away, there was no other way around it - then John Lithgow has to be the perfect choice for this character. And Lithgow did a marvelous job",Pet Sematary
934,cobra2020,Very disppointing,5,12 April 2019,Loved the book - big let down watching the movie. Some parts were ok so I give it a 5 for effort.,Pet Sematary
935,Juanyomum,"Good, but predictable.",7,15 April 2019,"The movie was gory, true to the original story and had amazing SFX. There were no downfalls that I could really see. However, you're better off just watching the previous movie adaptations or reading the novel; the film didn't really give much of a unique take to the story, and it's what you would expect.
Overall, not a terrible movie, and quite enjoyable. But it isn't anything special, and I can't come up with any reasons of why they remade it other than the fact that the IT remake did so well.
Is it worth seeing? Sure. But don't expect anything other than what you already know of the story.",Pet Sematary

It is not true to the book or movie as it is focuses more on the horror and tension rather than the overall story. That is not to say it is all bad -as a stand alone movie you would probably enjoy it, the acting isn't bad, it does a good job of creating a dark atmosphere and setting tension. If you are a fan of the book or old movie, it is best to not watch it or just keep an open mind.",Pet Sematary
938,rommanoclaudie,Good movie!,8,5 June 2019,I liked this remake. I think it stepped up the game from the original. It paid homage to the first version while telling a story that was sufficiently different so that it maintained its level of suspense.,Pet Sematary
939,aaronmrupe,Sometimes Leaving It The Same Is Better,5,17 April 2019,"Ok, I'm all for a surprise and giving some latitude to change the original story line a little....but come on!!! Having Elle and Gage switch parts just didn't work. For one, Gage can't communicate to his parents about Pascow but somehow Rachel understands. Secondly, Elle coming back from the dead and knowing that she's dead is completely and utterly bad writing. This is when things started to go down hill quickly. Jud was the best part of the movie and really wasn't used properly. His death scene where he saw his wife didn't make any sense either. He never told the story of the neighborhood boy, Timmy that was buried by his father and came back as some kind of evil zombie....not someone that knew that they had died, none the less someone that could carry a conversation. Zelda had WAY too much screen time and really had a very minor part in the actual story line....but she is freaking creepy. The first hour and 10 minutes is really good, except the under use of Lithgow.....the final 20 minutes not so much.",Pet Sematary

But the story was linear, no twists, no surprises, and certainly no subplots. Halfway through I was checking the time to figure out when it would end. Clarke's performance as the hero/doctor/dad was predictable and the most interesting part of the story was the wife's inner guilt about her sister's death. I recommend for a night of Netflix after you've already seen everything else on Netflix you want to see. I was just bored.",Pet Sematary

943,katey-01719,Such a let down..,3,28 April 2019,"I loved the original, but was unbelievably disappointed with this remake. Without spoiling anything, they removed vital parts of the story, so lots of things happened ""just because"". They sacrificed many little details that clarify the story so they could put in unnecessary jump scares, and it really did ruin the movie. The story was choppy, because many details were skipped, and I found myself disengaged most of the time because of it. A few characters were completely left out, and a few important characters were barely touched on like Victor; again, hurting the story progression. If you haven't seen, or aren't a fan of the original, it's not a bad film. If you're expecting it to be an updated version of the original movie,I think you might be disappointed.",Pet Sematary

948,stacierjet,Don't expect this to be anything like the original,3,19 October 2020,"I remember watching the original film as a kid and being terrified. That was the power the Stephen King had with his storytelling.This movie felt very disjointed. The role of Victor was significantly downplayed, but it didn't completely fail at some level of foreshadowing. He makes a couple of appearances, but his presence isn't enough to make you question is impact on the plot (assuming you've never seen the original or read the book).Judd is perhaps the most charming character; but then, looking at John Lithgow's body of work and comparing it to his counterparts in this film would explain that. Louis' character missed the mark for me. He manages to pull off a combination of disarming and apathetic. I'm not quite sure how he manages this feat, but I feel nothing when looking at him. It makes it difficult - in my mind - to justify him attempting to bring his daughter back to life. He speaks of a special bond that isn't shown between the two.Ellie is nine, but her persona has been watered down to...something less than nine. I dunno. I don't have kids of my own, but they probably should have made her character younger. Death is obviously one theme of this book, and it's discussed at different points how Ellie is mature enough to handle the topic. I didn't get the sense she would be.Rachel was a convincing character. The backstory between she and her invalid sister probably could have been expanded on somewhat, but with the material they provided, I thought she did a nice job. She was warm and loving, and her motivations for being sensitive to the topic of death were clear.We don't see the same from Louis' character. His profession is in direct competition with death, and perhaps that's the point that the writers didn't make clear enough here; he has been around death and desensitized to it, and only comes to accept its finality when he's forced to. And he can't. Rachel, on the other hand, is consistent in her views for the most part. She grows to accept the untimely death of her daughter, albeit in a somewhat short timespan.Gage is virtually an in-table in this movie. He is mentioned throughout various points, but his significance isn't clear. Even at the end.The most convincing actor/character was Church the cat. Insert cat growls here. That is our marker for understanding his change in personality. The writers were decent enough not to show the cat's death, or even allude to it until Judd takes Louis to show him Church's mangled body. He's unkempt and bites/claws at his family after his return from the Sematary. He lures his previous owner to her death. To me, that's fairly consistent with something a non-zombie cat might do. (I only say that because my cat can't read and I feel safe doing so.)I want to give special mention to the truck driver(s) in the movie. They were consistent in their delivery of driving way too fast and causing hazards for bystanders/fellow drivers.In considering the music and background, it falls victim to the common tactic of jump scares. Lots of characters hearing innocuous bumps and slowly approaching the suspected source of those bumps. Lots of tense music buildup, only to be followed by...nothing.The good: Judd, Rachel, Church the cat, the truck drivers, and Gage (because he's a baby, c'mon man)The meh: EllieThe not-so-good: LouisFinal verdict: You can probably get most of the worthy content from the trailers",Pet Sematary

950,SRaffield01,As soulless as any zombie,2,23 April 2021,"This version of Pet Sematary isn't the worst of the Stephen King adaptations, but it is one of the most empty.A lot of people made a huge deal out of the changes to the plot, but honestly that's small potatoes. It actually makes a lot of practical sense to make the changes they did. The problem is that the story feels like a paint-by-number. Say what you will about the original, and it had its issues, but it had a flowing narrative and it took time to establish relationships. This version does neither. Jud and Louis's friendship is never developed, the love between Louis and Rachel is nonexistent, and Gage might as well not be there at all.The storytelling is also choppy. It doesn't feel like one whole story, it feels like a series of semi-connected vignettes where everything is just leading up to one jump scare after the next. Certain plot points and lines feel like obligations instead of having any weight to them.And once the big change in the plot actually happens, the film goes totally off the rails. It's as if the writers and directors just had no idea what to do.Stick with the original. This is nothing but a cash-in on the success of the It film, and it certainly feels like it.",Pet Sematary

Stop it with the ""spooky indigenous lore"" trope its racist, stop with the ""creepy little girl trope"" stop with the ""unhinged wife"" trope. Like you're really not gonna specify which tribe?

The story felt rushed with little character development, wooden acting, and therefore little reaction or emotion felt for the tragedy that ensues.

I was willing to over look a few creative liberties and even appreciated some inclusions from the book that were left out of the original film.But my God the pacing was off.

To be fair the last horror I saw was Hereditary at the theater, which to me was the best horror I've seen since The Shining. I give that movie 9.5 out of 10 for comparison. But still, I brought my two sons, who are not familiar with the book or the original, and they were well scared - as was I, many points in the movie I was jolted. I appreciate it was not a duplicate of the original film - yes many elements the same, but definitely some creative twists from the original screenplay so many years ago.

That's awesome as a fan.I really thought this movie held up and I thought I would be against the small changes they made but I'm glad they did. Because I already seen the original and love it. The slight changes kept me invested. No one can replace Judson but if i going to let anyone try it would be John. The only acting that took me slightly out of my movie hypnosis was the daughters ""after death"" voice but I just feel her talking normally would have been creepier.I brought my mother with me to this one as I do with most of the horror movies I watch. She was a little unhappy with the ending but after i reminder her it really wasnt all that different of an ending to the original. She kind of came back to being sweet on it.If I was to be picky I would have liked a little bit more between Jud and the dad. Honestly 60 seconds of Jud warning him about not burying her or at least the father asking about it. Mayne I was just waiting for....""has anyone ever buried a person up there "" ""christ on this throne no!"".All in all.

It's good, and I'm sure if you haven't seen the 1989 original, it probably seems great...but if you have, it's disappointing.The jump scares are well executed (judging by people jumping in the cinema) but they're just loud noises, nothing more complex. The emotional trauma of the parents is mostly believable (more so on the mother's part), and the acting is overall very good. John Lithgow does a great job as the kindly yet foreboding neighbour. Although it pains me to say that he wasn't as good as Fred Gwynne, but they were big shoes to fill.I just wish they'd done something new with it. I wanted them to build up the suspense of the daughter being 'not right', but it all just happened too quickly, and not with enough oomph.5/10 stars for me, middle of the road.

The entire story is fast forwarded from the start, the nuances are thrown to the wayside...it's cardboard. Sure, I might sound like a snob but with THIS film I have to say it: there's never any reason to give two damns about any character....ever. Not ONE Character.

977,inside-man-581-911201,Hyped Out!!!,5,8 April 2019,It was advertised with a promotion from the venerable Stephen King as a movie so scary that it scared him... I didn't find any thing scary about this movie except for its lazy plot writing that attempted to deliver a different flavor of story line from the original classic... It failed... The advertisements also proclaimed it intended to feature the idea that after the lead character buried the family cat it would see him open up a rift between the world of the pet sematary the existing normal... What happened to that. - it was mentioned by the African American victim but it never materialized... Instead it was a slow plodding story line (it almost put me to sleep!!!)... It tried to sprint to the finish line by propping up the movie with well intended actors ( John Litgow being one of them)... It even missed the boat with a lame musical score that can normally push the audience to the brink of suspense but it couldn't... All in all it was another one of Hollywood's premiere flops that makes you wonder why a remake of the original classic was necessary???,Pet Sematary

Yes, it is kind of predictable when something scary would happen, but it still got me, I think they really did good job with the scary scenes.

Now this... 8 to girl dies instead, turning the whole scenario around. Then the little actress acts terribly. Then creepy but unnecessary mask to boost the atmosphere ( unsuccessfully).

The atmosphere in the 2019 version is very good and intense, but there is one big difference from the book and that left me disappointed by the movie.
All actors are very good except for the little girl, she annoyed me especially at the ending. Gage was a good cast, almost identical to Miko Hughes.

992,stylofantome,Everything Fell Apart,4,29 May 2019,"To this day, the original Pet Sematary is one of the movies that scares me the most.The original IT miniseries also traumatized me as a child, and the movie remake was SO. GOOD., so that led me to have high hopes for Pet Sematary.Womp womp.It had such potential! Great casting! Jason Clarke as Louis, and THE John Lithgow as Jud, I was practically giddy. I was even excited to see that they'd casted Obssa Ahmed as Pascow - still not a diverse movie at all, but at least it was a step forward from the previous film.And then ... well ... as every movie lately seems to go, it just sort of ... disintegrated.I knew from the previews that Ellie would be the one to die, not Gage, which I thought would be interesting. But it turns out - part of what made reanimated-Gage so creepy was because he couldn't really talk. He was just this menacing being, almost a creature.Having Ellie come back and actually spend time with her dad and talk to him, well ... she didn't come off creepy so much as she came off as a cranky child. The scene in the living room? That wasn't scary - she was legit having a temper tantrum. Zombie or not, temper tantrums aren't scary. They're annoying.I was also SUPER disappointed in the mom. Rachel's role isn't a very big one, but she was pleasant and supportive in the original, a typical sort of mom for that time period, and the story of her sister Zelda is just as scary in the remake as it is in the original (can't watch that scene, gives me nightmares), if not scarier.But in this remake, Rachel is one of the weakest characters EVER. She's constantly crying or upset and becoming emotional. It's a bit ridiculous. I felt like she was always having a fit of the vapors. What century are we in?Pascow also broke my heart. They diversify the role, YAY!, and then take away ALL THE FRICKIN' LINES. He's barely present! What was the point!? Just some gurgling ghost that's constantly fading away. This doubly upsets me because they did the same thing to Mike in the IT remake - they took away a lot of his scenes and lines and gave them to Ben, which is kinda screwed up.And then, of course, the ending. Why didn't Rachel leave Gage with her parents? It would've made more sense, and stuck somewhat to the original movie's storyline. Why couldn't Jud fend off Ellie? I mean, SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL! In the original, Gage did a sneak attack and Jud was a much less robust man, so I could understand him winning that fight. But in the remake, Jud and Ellie have somewhat of a showdown, and all I could think was THROW HER ACROSS THE ROOM!Then it just gets ridiculous. The mom falling asleep, then barricading the door in the storage room - which she couldn't even do properly because this woman is apparently incapable of ANYTHING. We get to have a The Shining moment of getting the kid out the window, but whoops! No time/room/energy for the mom. Only at least in The Shining, we got that iconic ""here's Johnny!"" moment, whereas in Pet Sematary remake, we get just a hysterical woman acting ridiculous.It just gets worse and there's so many more problems from then on out, the climax and ending is just a dumpster fire, but I don't want to completely spoil it for people who may like that sort of thing. I'll just say they decided to take the risk of deviating from the original quite a bit, and it did not pay off for me.",Pet Sematary

It's not just another ""horror movie"" and would have to be extremely well written by someone who knows how to write characters with depth, not just ""types"", for this book to work as a movie.

Now it's not so little girl in a mask.The sick sister of the mum scenes were bad too. The original scene was INCREDIBLY creepy for me personally but this new take seems to be trying way too hard to be creepy where the first just was.I was left feeling disappointed and bored. They changed too much of the story and like someone else said, it's now just a crappy zombie film.

What the hell is Hollywood doing?!",2,12 May 2019,"I basically went in without expectations, nor had I read any reviews so I was not influenced one way or the other. The movie had potential, I will grant them that, it had very good actors, mainly The female lead Amy Seimetz and the girl playing Ellie. A complete waste of a fantastic actor like John Lithgow, he did great but his character development was pretty darn stupid. The interaction of the old classic between Jud and Lewis are simply not there in this film. I also found that the new Lewis was not portraying a father who has completely lost control from grief in a proper way, he seemed to be in some kind hazy trance. His wife did a much better job at portraying a grieving mother. First act is good, really good, after that this thing starts to crumble really fast.The 2nd act is not as terrible as the 3rd but it is still lacking, mainly due to the poor script that doesn't deal with the interactions and the character development of the 3 main characters properly. We never really understand Jud's motivation or learn about his experience with the cemetery, this is shown super fast in the 3rd act in the dumbest way possible. We never see a clear characterization of one of King's creepiest character, Zelda. She's jumbled in the script here and there in a mediocre way. And we never get to see that wonderful relationship Jud and Lewis have in the book or the old film.The 3rd act is truly sad, I mean it's really garbage writing, zombie family, really? That's the best they could muster? Pathetic. The little girl is now possessed by demon we know nothing about, she can do inhuman things like carry her mother from the house to the Indian burial, crossing the wooden levy by herself and all this happens in like no time...bad writing, period.So what we have is basically ANOTHER unnecessary remake of a fantastic book and a pretty darn good movie. I understand not wanting to copy the first film but at least try to stick close to the material and not go bananas and put one of the most cliche, boring, retarded endings this year has to offer. In conclusion, it has no redeeming factor towards the book and the old film is by miles a better adaptation than this.Also, those of you who put a 10 wouldn't know a good horror film if it hit you right in the nose.

Pros: The Cat, The wendigo,and John Lithgow and the 1st act
Cons: Everything else, even though the acting isn't bad there's no character connection, no common thread tying these people together, they skipped on the whole Bond Between Jud Crandall and Louis. In fact he comes off a bit douchy, I can see they were trying to sell the whole wendigo pull to do these terrible things but they didn't pull that off, Louis didn't get the same sense of grief and loss as in the 80s classic, his wife showed that a whole lot better, final travesty Zelda, totally missed the mark on that one.

Clarke and Lithgow do a good job with a very thin script...the filmmakers really did try and scare the audience with a jump scare every 5-10 minutes and increasing that majorly in the last act..
Not going all nostalgic, but the original although a bit cheesy at times, was actually scary and didn't really on cheap jump scares.
The whole ""twist"" everyone's is talking about is revealed in the second trailer , and it didn't pay off...

1007,fordslidenspin,Don't waste your money,1,21 April 2019,"If you're a fan of the original do not even waste your money on this..First off nothing about it was scary or even creepy like the original.
I was sorely disappointed in the first 5 minutes. They miss the entire friendship between Jud and Louis, miss all the great telling and flashbacks of how the Micmac Indian ground had reanimated things over the years. It felt dull, rushed and unauthentic. Rachel's character was awful and unbelievable. The little girl that played Ellie was good but they didn't give you enough time with her to develop any sort of feeling for her, like they did gage in the original. None of the characters felt bonded or cohesive. I did not believe them as a family at all.
The Pascow character in this movie wasn't as believable as in the original, he didn't come across as concerned or trying to protect the Creeds. While I love Jon Lithgow and think he is a fantastic actor, I feel like his portrayal of Judd was missing something. I didn't feel like he was as close to the Creeds as he is in the book or the original, he felt out of place. I absolutely LOATHED the ending and felt incredibly cheated by it. I left the theater angry because it wasn't as good as they could have made it or even as good as the trailers portrayed. I loved the remake of It and expected so much out of this. If you've never seen the original or read the book I can see this would be a good movie. However it lacks a lot for me because I am such a fan of the story and honestly believe it deserved so much more.
I did like that Ellie instead of Gage was brought back and that Church has a part in that. I did like her ability to voice her feelings on her death and what happened to her. I did like that they weaved Norma into the story but wish it was more like the book in that aspect. More of Pascow and his involvement would have made it better as well.

It started and finished kinda boring. I feel like it relied too much on its twist, but after the said twist it not only continued beeing boring, it also just turned into mediocre slasher flick. I do believe movie makers couldn't understand what made the book so good. As much as I like Jason Clarke and John Lithgow, I do feel like they really didn't have much to work with on this one.
All in all - it failed to capture what made King's book special. It tried (with a pretty ""meh"" twist) to stand out a bit from the book and the original movie, but it failed in that category also.

Such bad acting, it was ridiculous. Apart from John Lithgow, he was great. But Jason Clarke was especially bad.
I didn't really care what was happening, I couldn't care less about any of the characters. There was no atmosphere, no uneasiness, no creepiness. Every scene in the woods, behind the cemetery, looked so cheap and amateurish, with the fake fog, branches-cracking noises, some distant creature screams. Oh and the dialogue, the dialogue was so pointless and stupid, ""What is this?What are we doing here?What is this place?"" over and over again.

1015,janledeboer,"Different from the book, better for the screen",4,18 September 2019,"First of all, there is no comparison between the two films with the book. The book crushes them because as most of the time, the book is more complete and tells you a lot of details and stuff that makes the story more enjoyable. Now, even though the first film is more loyal to the novel, it feels like when you squish 8 people in a car made for 6. It feels like everything is thrown with no porpuse, it doesn't explain a lot of things and again it moves so fast.But I came here to critique the 2019 remake, and oh god it turns the wheel into another direction. The difference between the first film and this one is that the first one had the screenplay written by Stephen King the author of the novel and the second one by Jeff (someth.) who is an actual screenwriter. That I guess is the reason the first movie is very similar to the book. But the 2019 remake is very different, it takes the concept, the names and some character acrs but goes into another direction. So if someone that just read the book is specting to watch a good ADAPTATION it will be a disappointing experience. But that's the deal, is an adaptation, that's the point, as so this films absolutely fails to do that. And if it just were a original screenplay, it still will not be that good considering how much it misses and has some cuestionable stuff.Adaptations are hard, to fit around 400 pags into a less that 2 hour movie is a hard task.

I decided to give the remake a chance and know that it is not going to be as good as the original, but I just wasn't terrified. I felt that Gage made a much more horrifying image. He represented purity turned evil. You don't feel that same impact from a much older child that can talk fully. The actors in the remake are somewhat emotionless in comparison to the original. You don't understand their sorrow when their child dies. A sorrow so strong you'd do anything to bring them back. Overall I felt it was rushed and lacked the depth of the original.

It started out ok, following the original story line but soon drifted off into some reimagined tripe. It's sad because this could of been a worthy remake to a legendary story. Case in point don't mess with the originals. If you do them by all means do them justice.

1029,n00bMLG,Sometimes dead is meh,3,28 April 2019,"The recent success of Stephen King adaptations must have inspired the creation of this film, I have not seen the 1989 version and I have only just now started reading the book, although I had knowledge of how the book ended. I was decently excited to see this film and it had some potential, but the final product is a serviceable but mediocre horror film that entertains but doesn't truly scare. The biggest issue with the movie is it's very hesitant to commit, the novel covers some very dark themes around the inevitability of death but the film only pokes the themes with a stick. Briefly introducing them in dialogue but not doing much else with them. The movie greatly suffers from being rushed, it never really takes its time to build up to characters or scares and just rushes its way from one plot point to another without giving any of them the time they need. What we end up with is a movie with decent acting, a few decent scares, a very messy third act and a stupid ending. Overall the film is mediocre but enjoyable, if you're a fan of the genre and just want a fun time at the movies it's worth a watch but it won't be one you remember, and it definitely doesn't live up to the legacy of the book.One other thing I'd like to touch on is the abysmal marketing, the second trailer has to be one of the worst movie trailers I've ever seen, the trailer touches on every major plotline in the movie and spoils basically everything but the ending, it even spoiled the one twist they changed from the book. If that wasn't bad enough they released a third trailer a week before the film came out, and the opening shot of the trailer had major spoilers for the movie. This kind of marketing has sadly become a common practice with a lot of films and it really needs to stop, a film sometimes gets upwards of 3 trailers before it releases, what's the point in seeing the movie if the trailer has all the best moments and ruins all the surprises?",Pet Sematary

Some of the only similarities it has with the original works is the name and names of characters. The movie has many points where modern horror movie cliches were stapled in, with no meaning behind them. As my girlfriend eloquently put it, ""What?"" Modernization is one the movies biggest faults. In the original movie the main character was just as unsure about what happens after death as his daughter but was trying his best to make her feel safe, in this one he's just like, ""Lol you just die.""",Pet Sematary

1042,martinelliott-09715,Too many jump-scares,4,7 April 2019,"Cliche after cliche. This is one of the many recent examples of horror movies that truly made me question whether I actually still derived any enjoyment from the genre. A moment of weakness. Of course I did. This isn't horror - it's modern horror i.e. a nonstop succession of random, psychoacoustic jumpscares and ""creepy"" children spouting b.s. - and of course like all modern horror, it takes itself way too seriously.
And why are all these modern horrors filmed in that try-hard gloomy grey filter that makes everything look gloomy and gothic all the time, thus highlighting the cynical and one-dimensional agenda of this movie and movies like it. Contrasts, people!! The sun is allowed to shine in a horror movie, you know....it makes the dark scenes darker ...and another thing; not every actor in this movie has to look pale and deathly ill 24/7.
Of course the above rant could just as easily apply to any horror movie made in the last 10 years - they really are that generic.
Unlike most people, I didn't think the ending was that bad. I was just glad it was over. Look, it's not terrible...I've seen worse. They really tried in some places: Juds death scene was nicely executed; the dumbwaiter story was creepily effective, the scene near the start with Louis in the car illuminated in red was a nice touch and some elements of the sound design were impressive...but modern horror really needs to get its act together. Still, I'd rather watch this than the Suspiria remake. This filmmakers obviously didn't heed the movies advice ""sometimes dead is better"". Just stop remaking everything already!",Pet Sematary
1043,kalleypeds,NOT a good movie.,4,6 April 2019,"It started off making you wonder what all the nonsense was about with the family owning 50 acres of property yet they only lived/saw 1. Why would anyone buy a house without checking out the property? There's a freakin Pet ""cemetery"" in the back yard for crying out loud.
I would have liked to see the writers incorporate a meaning for the wild ass tanker that drives 65 MPH on the two lane highway. & every-time it drove by something bad happened or was foreshadowed. Yet no one wondered About the truck at all?! Until it killed the girl of course, but anyone with a brain could have saw that coming.
There was absolutely no wow factor or thrilling feelings when watching this. I hate scary movies because I get very scared and this one was not very scary... the ending sucked and looked like it should have belonged in the Purge.
In conclusion: Don't waste your money",Pet Sematary
1044,sonic_blue-53380,Seriously disappointed.,1,6 April 2019,"I was excited for this remake the second I heard it was coming out! I figured with today's movie tech it could be more like the original story, even more so than the first 1989 movie. The story was changed so much to stand out as an artistic original for the directors, that it became a glorified zombie movie (eye roll). I read the book and watched the original movie, so I had high expectations for this to be even better than those! But it was a huge let down.
I hated the switch in characters, the daughter brought a whole new dynamic to the story and that alone changed the entire feeling for the movie in my opinion. Plus she was older so you're not as heart wrenched at the tragedy of her death, and I hated that when she came back she had memories of her life and just spoke in a lower voice to show her ""changed"" behaviour. I wasn't really a fan of her acting, had she played the Ellie from the original storyline, I think I would have liked her.
I also hated Jason Clark's portrayal of Louis Creed, he was kind of rude and standoff-ish and had zero emotion towards anything in this movie. The original Louis is loving, heartfelt, and affectionate. In this movie he just made you feel like he didn't care about anything. In the book and first movie Louis' grieving is so intense for his child after he dies that you're actually scared for why he's going to do. And when the child does come back; he comes back different. NOT zombie like but actually something worse. I was not impressed with the new version of the zombie being able to talk and converse with Louis and definitely thought the dancing and trashing the place was unnecessary and quite dumb.
And I hated Louis' relationship with Judd; he treats him like some kind of old relative you just want to die already. The original friendship is so much more, Judd shares way more info about the burial ground and gives more history to its powers and consequences. This movie left out a lot, and left a lot to be desired.
I also didn't like the role of Victor Pascal, he had a bigger part to play in the book and in this movie was just sort of thrown in to show they used a guy named Victor.
And lastly, the ending was absolutely TERRIBLE! It was literally just quick deaths, and then scene jumps to zombies standing around in dirty clothes. The girl trying to bury everyone to bring them back to life was ridiculous, it made zero sense and had nothing to do with the original story. I found this to be a cheap attempt for the directors to try and make it their own and add a twist, but it totally bombed and became just another zombie film like every other movie out there.
This story is terrifying, and meant to be sad enough to make you go crazy after being witness to the worst tragedy any parent could ever face. Crazy enough to want to dig up your dead child and bury them in an evil burial ground so that they could come back from death. And then being absolutely petrified with fear when the person you wanted back is no longer there and something else stands in its place.
Instead you get no character chemistry, changed plot and storyline, and a generic run-of-the-mill zombie wannabe movie.",Pet Sematary

Pet sematary is not meant to be a comedy. Many aspects were greatly toned down. The worst part I think was the dialogue from Ellie later in the movie.

The original movie was one of the first Stephen King adaptation films I had watched, and it truly sparked my interest in horror films. The new film did not have the same flare as the book or original film. I understand the endeavor to put a fresh spin on an old tale, but this film fell flat. I do applaude the young lady who portrayed Ellie, her acting skills are phenomenal; however, the rest of the performances felt subpar.

In doing that, I would have to put a bunch of spoilers in. I think I will opt to make this review for everyone and not put spoilers. Ok, after writing, I might be a little ""spoiley"", but not too bad.First, Pet Sematary, the remake is better than the original movie because there is better acting, with the exception of Pascow. I still think the original Pascow is better. However, the actors/actresses for Louis, Rachel, Jud, Ellie, Gage, Church the cat all have superior performances to the original.Second, more is explained in regards to people's motives for keeping on going back to the Pet Sematary (well really the mic mac burial ground) even though they know deep down that the outcome will always be bad. Jud is more clear than the original Jud. He may not talk as much as he does in the book, but then people would complain that Jud talks too much. This is important because it makes the movie scarier in that we know their motives and maybe we can relate if we ever experienced grief.Next, when they ""come back"", it is scarier. The suspense is definitely there. Do you want a cheap jump scare? Or do you want your heart to pound in anticipation of the jump scare and feel haunted afterwards? That's ultimately the terror of the movie.. the ""when they come back"" aspect.Further, the characters are smarter than the original. I cannot say too much without giving anything away so I will leave it at that.Finally, they have aspects of the book that they did not have in the original movie, which I really appreciated.

It was creepy but the story was too patchy to really scare me. Firstly relying on too many predictable jump scares. Like come on a truck passing as a jump scare? I didn't understand what that guy victor that died in the car crash had to do with the burial ground? And then like the girl just wandering into some guys house she didn't know like come on that wouldn't happen. And these people somehow didn't know whether or not they owned the Pet Sematary which was like directly outside their doorstep I mean come on they would have at least looked at the house before they bought it and seen it cos it's like RIGHT THERE. Then when the girl comes back to life and like one minute she's with her dad then next minute she's in Judd's house like since when can she teleport? And sorry but the forest/burial ground looked waaay too fake to be scary- Waay too much smoke looked like a stage with the smoke machine going the whole time? And the second half of the movie didn't really make sense- it becomes a zombie kind of movie where everyone starts killing everyone and I didn't understand why- why did Ellie bring her mum back to life if she hated her? Why did the mum kill the dad? What's up with the baby in the car why do they wanna kill their baby? Would have liked to have seen a proper ending? Also I didn't really see the dad properly grieve before bringing Ellie back so it seemed quite rushed.. So yea all in all too patchy and not realistic enough to really be scary!,Pet Sematary

However, I saw the new one last night and I think they completely missed the mark. I appreciate a new storyline, but the characters have been completely stripped of any nuance, and the movie lacks a meaningful theme. The book and the original movie drew believable and flawed characters, which are now replaced by cardboard cutouts.
A few examples.
In the original, Judd shows Louis the burial ground as a warning. In one way or another Louis would have been drawn there, so he might as well learn that what comes back does not correspond to what gets buried there. Better having this insight with a cat, rather than with a person. A difficult and cynical call, which completely backfired. In the new version Judd simply did this so Ellie wouldn't be heartbroken....really makes for a compelling character.
In the original, Rachel is traumatized by Zelda's death because of her sense of guilt. Rachel felt a mixture of sorrow and disgust for Zelda, and wished for her to die. When this happened, she never got over her guilt for wishing for this, and probably felt responsible for her death. Zelda was a victim, and Rachel's visions are a manifestation of her guilt. In the new version, Zelda was jealous of Rachel's health, suggesting that she was malicious from the start. Sure, there is the incident with the lift... but the important bit, the fact that Rachel is conflicted and human, is pared back & dumbed down.
In the original, Louis's relationship with Rachel's family has always been tense. When Gage died, Rachel's parents blamed it all on Louis. This, on top of his own sense of guilt, ultimately drove him to bury his son... rationally knowing what to expect. On a similar note, Louis repeats the whole thing again when he buries his wife. He knows.... but keeps on lying to himself, because he's flawed - and human. In the new version, some of his bad choices are still there (actually only one), but the key element of him being delusional (because he's human and pushed beyond reason) is watered down, replaced by a character who is primarily a victim to circumstance.
So the theme of the original story, 'our weaknesses make us the architects of our own demise', is replaced by 's*** happens'. I've seen amazing horror movies in the past few years (Babadook, the vvitch, hereditary)... which prove you can make something that both entertains and provides meaningful subtext, if you're so inclined to digging a bit deeper. This clearly does not fall in that category.",Pet Sematary

Only problem is what I wanted and I what I received were two totally different entities.The film itself feels very disjointed. There's no character build up, no tension, characters had no chemistry on screen together, bad cgi, even the acting was subpar. Ultimately there was no natural flow to the film. And the relationships between characters felt awkward at best.Best thing you can do is wait until this comes out on Hulu, Netflix, on demand. Red box, or in the bargain bin and then watch it.

The only reason I gave this movie a 5 star is due to the horrible sound quality. There is so much more to a movie than going from a one to ten on the sound meter within a second. While this technique is great for movie theaters it is not for at home viewing. I have a surround sound and found myself turning it all the way up just to hear what was being said then going deaf the next second it decides to blare the thrill.

The child who plays Ellie creed did a stand up job playing an evil lil killing machine, The atmosphere is dark and creepy but it still lacks genuine fright. The Bad things about the film is the pacing... The movie starts off extremely slow and then rushes through.. Certain elements from the Book/film that made the story TRULY terrifying were omitted from this film... For example there is NO Timmy Bateman Flashback and I felt his one scene made the original film extremely scary... The sickness obsessed housekeeper who worked for the creeds is NOT in the movie at all... Pastor felt like a, WAIST of character in this Remake.. He barely had any screen time and I HONESTLY feel they added pascow to the film for Fan Favor because he LITERALLY had no point in the film... John Lithgow does a great job as Jud..

1105,saitochan,Okay but nothing special,6,3 April 2021,"This, like the book of the same name, follows a family moving into a new house in the town of Ludlow. This house happens to have a busy road right beside it that ""uses up"" a lot of animals, so the children of the town built a cemetery for their furry friends just beyond the trees.This movie, speaking purely as an adaptation, is okay. It has most, if not all of the major scenes from the book with a few slight tweaks. One thing that baffles me is why they made the choice to change which child gets resurrected by the Wendigo. I honestly don't mind this change so much since Ellie dies get way more development than Gage both in this movie and in the original book and it makes her fears of death earlier in the movie a neat piece of foreshadowing.No, what I do dislike about this movie is how fast it goes compared to it's book counterpart. The pacing if this movie is insanely fast, Louis and Jud's entire friendship developing in one or two scenes whereas this was built up for a long time in the book, Louis going as far as to save Jud's wife in the book, though Norma Crandall was absent from this movie. It adds way less weight to Jud inviting Louis to the Micmac burial ground later on. Also the character of Zelda is used way too much in my opinion. Sure, Rachel has PTSD about her sisters death resulting in death being a sore subject for her and yes, she was used in a very similar way in the book. However, this movie focussed way too much time on her in the hopes of making it scary. Zelda was not a force of horror in this movie, she appeared to screw around with Rachel's head a little and then disappeared. The wendigo was also underutilized in this adaptation. In the book Louis is confronted by the beast while carrying his dead son through the little god swamp, but the movie reduced it to a shadow in the background. It never explains that it is the force of the wendigo that is resurrecting the dead. Instead the wendigo simply appears to add a small amount of tension later on.I actually liked the changes to the ending. The book's ending with Lois burying his wife on my to have her come back as a wendigo possessed zombie fell flat for me because showing her actually appear robbed the ending of the tension it would have had if it ended with Louis waiting for Rachel to come back. The movie's ending is much more open ended, where the now zombified creeds approach Gage, who is locked in the car. This ending has more tension than the book's in my opinion because it doesn't actually tell you the outcome, even though we can assume that they killed and resurrected Gage.In conclusion, while this movie is far from perfect, it doesn't deserve all if the 1 and 2 star reviews. The original movie adaptation had a little trouble with pacing itself and I think people are artificially glorifying it based on the fact that it followed the book closer and came out first. Yes there are aspects of the original that I like more than the remake just as there are aspects of the remake that I like more than the original. If you've read the book or seen the original movie I would recommend giving it a watch. It might not be scary but it is interesting to see how they changed the source material, though I personally would have liked to see them lean a little further into this change, maybe showing a bond between Zombified Ellie and Church or having a little more scenes with the wendigo.",Pet Sematary
1106,aunkunnithi,Worth for time,10,5 March 2021,"Pet sematary is a horror and dark movie from novel. In my opinion the story is go on too fast, some of scenes are pointless but some have a lot of details and have a lot of scenes that doesn't make sense such as there is a truck that appear 3 times in movie and almost killed 3 people, I don't know if there is some reason in novel that make this make sense but it doesn't show in the movie, and scene that have lightning just like fantastic movie it make the movie more exciting but not suit horror movie. I like this kind of movie and I think this is a good one it makes me goosebumps many scenes, the plot and story is so good and make me very exciting. After watched this movie make me down for a day.
(Spoiler warning)
The story is about there is a family that moved to a small town in Maine I think, There is father, mother, daughter, son, and a cat. Some day the cat way died because of it hit by car so daughter name Ellie is very sad so some how father found the way that can make the cat back to life again. After the cat back to life, it not like before and it look very creepy for me after the time pass cat look more and more creepy like it's rot body and look like it very upset and angry all the time. In the Ellie's birthday party Ellie is hit by the truck then dad did the same thing to Ellie and then the cat do not attack Ellie any more and these two look after and kill everyone. After both cat and Ellie back to life I got goosebumps and I think look very creepy, while I write this review and look back to the story and still got goosebumps when think to scary scene (It was 2 years ago when I have watching it). This movie is just great and worth for watching but it's very scary(just waning).",Pet Sematary
1107,eleahnel,Nostalgia Blinds,7,2 April 2021,"I didn't see the 1989 version until recently. And I saw this one just a little bit ago. And let me tell you, the film isn't as bad as all the 1 stars are making it out to be. The original had an amazing performance from the child and Jud, but there was a lot to be desired. The hammy jokes in the second half. The main character's acting or lack thereof. The random side plot of the maid who kills herself because of stomach cancer. There was plenty wrong with the original.Now, I am not ever going to say this was a masterful film or anything. I don't understand how they accuse this one of being a cliché zombie flick though, since actually, those brought back don't eat faces and are actually reasonable. To be honest, it actually feels more in line with the rest of the lore to have Ellie being creepy, but still reasonable, given that the cat in both films was creepy but didn't act like a blood psychopath.People find anything and everything to complain about, especially when something perceivably treads over their nostalgia. I felt like, despite Jud being unequivocally lesser than Fred Gwynne's performance, the acting was on a whole a bit more middling. Everyone's performances were passable. I actually want to give props to the little actress who played Ellie for how well she did with the role, going from a vivacious little girl to the thing we see in the later half. There were very few jumpscares, some interesting lore building (that I frankly wish had been expanded on), and a suitably bleak conclusion.Now, this isn't going to be an instant classic or anything, but this film was definitely something I enjoyed. It also really liked to mess with expectations created by the original, without being too much. We know Ellie's in the road and really, it was obvious she was probably going to be the one who got hit, but Gage running towards the road is still a bit harrowing.I really feel like they missed a trick by never featuring the wendigo though. They had the time and potential to make something truly horrifying, even if just the silhouette. Beyond this, the fact is there was no major standout performance aside from what I've said about Ellie. Perhaps a touch predictable and squandering some potential brought at the beginning with the children in the masks, as it became pretty clear that all of them were dead like Ellie and the masks were their pets, just like her.So all in all, yeah.

1126,hsfredes,Sometimes dead is better...,4,6 June 2019,"Since I saw the trailer I knew this movie would not be good. There was something that was not quite right about it and unfortunately I was not wrong.Let's start by saying that this film can not and should not be compared with the 1989 version because it's different. It's based on the same material but it's very different and not for the better. The main problem is not the differences with the original version, but with the way in which the film was carried out. I've heard and read a lot of complaints regarding Dale Midkiff's interpretation in the original version because he was too ""stiff"". Unfortunately, Jason Clarke does not do a better job nor does Amy Seimetz as the contrived mother (in fact she is almost annoying). In this version Pascow is useless and adds nothing to the plot because he's almost an extra as are Gage, Zelda, the Wendigo subplot, Norma Crandall, Rachel's parents, the masked children's procession, Timmy Baterman, the Mic-Mac indians and all the other plot elements.The weight of the film is taken by John Lithgow (as a very good Jud Crandall, though not as good as Fred Gwynne's) and Jeté Lawrence (as the new victim of Orinco's truck). She is, without a doubt, the main star in this movie. Her interpretation is very sinister and stands out above the rest of the cast.The film is very slow and boring until the death of Elle, from then on ir tries to take off and achieves it in a certain way, but it does not manage to become the tragic and somber story that it should be. It ends up becoming a film with a thousand times seen formula and with the bitter feeling of so much wasted potential.",Pet Sematary

In this version, each tragedy causes the next, like a runaway train. Once they move to the new house, the events are inevitable. Having the girl get killed rather than the toddler allows for way more dark, complex and creepy situations.The evil of the burial ground is more palpable, and you get the feeling that the people are being influenced by the Wendigo. The same goes with Rachael's vision of Zelda. In the original, they were just flashbacks to provide backstory, but here the visions start as soon as they move to the new house (she even says so), and she is more like haunted by Zelda, via the Wendigo.",Pet Sematary

With that being said I am a little biased but was very excited to see this movie when I saw the previews. As stated in the title, the beginning was awesome, middle was good but I felt like they skipped over very key information that led and built up the story. For instance in the original Louis Creed asks Jud,""has anyone every buried a person up there"" then of course later on they go into detail that they actually did. In this one they hint and skim over it with newspaper articles. I felt like the put too much time into church's character and not enough into Zelda, whom like I said at the beginning, the movie ruined me with nightmares and that was because of Zelda. In this one they sped it up and wasn't as good as the first. The acting in the new one is phenomenal and the cinematography is amazing along with the music, it was all pretty good until Ellie comes back.....I felt like the movie then turned for the worse and got very cheesy and rushed and unrealistic with Ellie dragging her mom to the burial ground, then they speed it up some more and it just ends.

I'm not the kind of person who wants exactly what they expect, but in this adaptation the changes weaken the plot and character development. First the relationships are much less developed. The actors playing Louis and Rachel had no chemistry and felt just like two actors. The most important relationship is between Jud and Louis and their friendship is extremely downplayed. Louis describes Jud as the father he wish he had and in this movie their friendship seems purely to make the connection to the pet semetary. Other than that the movie was just a jump scare annoyance. I didn't like the change that it was Ellie who dies instead of Gage because the idea of a murderous demon toddler was more interesting that 7/8 year old scary girl like every other horror movie. The ending was cheesy and lackluster with a ton of plot holes. I don't mind changes from adaptations but if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it!",Pet Sematary

Jason Clarke is one of my favorite actors and this was easily his worst performance as well. It feels like even the actors knew they couldn't live up to the book or ORIGINAL movie. None of them have any energy or passion in their parts. I almost feel asleep. I even thought about walking out about 1/2 way in, but wanted to get my moneys worth.The changes they made to the ORIGINAL story were not necessary. Several times they create a scene that appears to be like the ORIGINAL, only to change it at the last second to a scene that has little impact.The best character in the book and the ORIGINAL movie was Jud. Fred Gwynne in the ORIGINAL movie was the perfect actor for the role. In this version, John Lithgow was so awful it destroys the entire movie. He's a good actor in general, but did not become Jud like Fred Gwynne did.If someone had never read the book or watched the ORIGINAL movie, they might find this version mildly interesting.

While the neighbor and ""semetary"" represent temptation and Pandora's box. The husband represents a modern time Dr. Frankenstein with how he attempts to bring the dead back and (originally) refuses to stop meddling and experimenting in trying to perfect the process. The phantasm, or his conscience continues to try and stop him... but he refuses to listen. In the end he creates his own demise.
Given that... the writers and directors started out with accurately, but dropped the ball in the end. They missed the mark. Instead they left us with a slap stick horror. Personally the reason why the originally stuck was not because it was an intense horror... but because the themes were so haunting. They stuck with us.

So when I watched this one I wasn't expecting much considering I've seen the original multiple times. I loved this. The characters went much deeper into the pathology of their roles than they did in the original. The improvement lies in how this version displayed what it would really be like if these things really happened. There was much more thought applied to the cat coming back from the dead and particularly the girl and how her coming back from the dead would be. It made sense why they diverged from the original story and chose the older sister as the one who died. An older child had much more capacity to play the part of a horrific character than a 3 year old child does. And her character steals the show.

My major irritations: 1. The director could have done some research on Fall in Maine. There are not fully green trees at Halloween and it's usually dark by 4:30 PM. 2. They could have also put some effort into the set of the movie's title. The Pet Semetary was the saddest thing I have ever seen and not improved by the fog machine and cheesy background used. 3. The main characters, husband and wife, seemed to know nothing about each other- religious beliefs, views on death, and most importantly the trauma of the wife's past. Hard to believe they had a nine year old child. 4. Also hard to believe - they had no idea what the property lines were if their new house and no one walked around the property before the purchase? 5.

The mask concept was a little over the top and I did not like how it ended with the little boy being the only survivor to what? Be raised by the dead or end up dead as well? It would've been better if the dad or mom had died saving the little boy instead of evil winning in the end. I left the theater wondering what would have happened to that poor boy.

1185,mandafalk,Disappointing,3,5 September 2020,"I loved Stephen Kings book ""Pet Cematary"" and the movie from 1989. That's why I can't believe how they butchered it and turned it into this mess of a movie. The changes were fine and I can appreciate the thought behind it. It was a pleasant surprise that they kept key-events that really made me think of the old version. However there were multiple things that bothered me.Spoilers ahead!*The scene where that young boy lost his life didn't add anything to the story. It just felt like they kept that in order to shock the audience with a gory death. Sure he appeared several times after that, but why? Nothing he did added to the story more than a ghostly, gory apparition scaring the father and the baby.*Whyyyyy did they include a story about the wendigo??? They didn't even talk about the lore or give a clear description of its history or attributes. They just threw it in there because ""oooh spoopy indian mythical thing! We need that!""*The sidestory with the mother and her dead sister. I can understand what they were trying to go for. But in my eyes they failed miserably. Why was it in there to begin with? I'll tell you. Shock value. Spooky moments to keep you on your toes. But yet again added nothing. It honestly felt like they didn't feel the Main story had enough content to work with. I'd rather see a movie where they concentrate on the story at hand rather than fill it with horrible clichés.*I can't believe how they ended it. No hope, no time for the audience to breathe and recover from the intense climax. Just leaving it and trying to convince you that it's open-ended. Even though we all know what's going to happen. I've always felt that needlessly hurting a child in a movie is disgusting. You could argue that it wasn't needlessly or that we don't know what happens next. But I don't agree. The movie left me upset by a number of reasons. Reasons I could've ignored but that ending ticked me off.All in all. Kind of stayed true to the original in some ways. Filled with shocking and gory scenes just for the heck of it, which lowered the score. A lot of things that doesn't belong and a bad ending as the cherry on top of this mess. Do not recommend.",Pet Sematary

1188,aehadamsah,Great little Easter egg!!,8,14 April 2019,"I thought the movie was very awesome and one thing I just wanted to mention was that in the beginning of the movie, Ellie is watching a spongebob cartoon, and that specific spongebob episode was one where they believe Squidward is dead but he ""comes back to life""...i just thought that was a great little foreshadowing thing that they put in there.",Pet Sematary
1189,stefoulephou,Interesting remake...but it lacks something,7,5 April 2019,"I'll be honest, when I saw the trailer, I was less than impress. I was afraid that the kids with the mask had an important part, I found strange that Ellie was the one who died etc...But I decided to go on an early screening, and I was really surprised to find that the movie was really well adapted. The first act and second act were very interesting, well directed and well acted. I was surprised that they kept the atmosphere and the deepness of the characters as well as some interesting moment in the dialogues that explained more of the characters motivation.The movie took it's time and I think it's a good thing, as I was afraid of getting modern cheap scare to balance the slow burning aspect of the original material.
And the way the movie is build up, I was really ok with the Ellie/Gage switch. I understood why they did it.And I was glad they brought up the Wendigo from the book. I was a bit disappointed with Zelda, as the one in the original movie was so scary, I was sure it couldn't be as good... and it wasn't, but still well done nonetheless .Where the movie lost a lot of points for me is at the third act. Ellie was not scary for me. The changing face while she attack Judd was more funny than anything, I almost burst out laughing, and most of her dialogue felt corny... she wasn't threatening at all....It seems that the movie build up very well the tension throughout the movie, but at the climax, it kind of stale and never goes deeper in what could have been very scary. I don't know how, but the whole third act seems flat, as if the directors didn't know what to do to elevate the tension.
The fate of the characters had no big impact emotionally (for me) and was disappointing because of all the potential it have.The guy playing Louis in the original was not a super good actor, but at least his breaking point was intense, and the one playing Rachel was really likeable ... their fate were terribly emotional and their demise felt like pure tragedy, as in this one it just felt like the end of the movie... it lack something...And I thought the final shot was interesting, but the way it was filmed... I don't know... It could have been terrifying, but I just though...""hmmm good idea""But I still say that this is good adaptation, better than what I was prepared for. It deserves to be seen. It's good, but could have been better",Pet Sematary

1191,rthomasx,Worth the Time not an exact duplicate of the book or '89 film,8,21 July 2019,"While expecting and hoping for a very close representation of the original novel, i became weary to pick this up after reading the review score and user reviews. Being a long time Stephen King fan i sucked it up and rented it from red box. While its not a carbon copy of either book nor predecessor I found myself quickly enjoying little nods to both as the plot unraveled.
The Themes remain in tact and some of the plot points not used in the original film are touched upon or nodded to throughout and even some from the original movie. The acting isnt atrocious as many people claim, the cast seems well placed for who they are and what they represent within the film. And its nice to see a remake that obviously has love for both the source material and the film. The film conveys a sense of dread throughout and more of a sense of sanity creeping further and further away than the original film.
Dont just immediately dismiss this film over fan boys being pissy about some changes. If you love the original and dont want to see your nostalgia disturbed then sure skip it but youre missing out on a good horror flick.",Pet Sematary

The characters are poorly developed and don't mesh well together. The character of Victor Pascow seemed to only be included as special effects eye candy and not as an important part of the story like the original. All in all, this movie really just disappointed.

Besides the fact that they gave away the biggest twist in the trailer, the pace of the movie is slow and wooden. Clarke as Louis Creed is a chunk of talking wood throughout the film. The role of Pascow the ghost is pointless with his 3-5 minutes of screen time. The best part is John Lithgow only because he's John Lithgow. Ellie was good but scary...not so much. It's like they made a reboot of the 1989 version instead of writing a new script based on the book. The 1989 version at least creeped me out when I was a kid. This new one had me checking my phone to see how much longer I'd have to watch it. Plus the cliffhanger ending is formulaic and contrived. They'll never make a sequel.

1204,bk-81827,A different kind of thriller.,9,5 April 2019,I was very impressed with this one! The story is well paced and the suspense is kept consistent. The use of foreshadowing is great and the lead actor portrays the role well. The thriller aspects are not what you expect and it drifts away from your typical horror/thriller film.

1206,kunga73,More Like a Lifetime Movie,6,15 April 2019,"This movie wasn't horrible. But I thought it lacked depth and originality. Its hard to make scary movies let alone live up to a Steven King novel. It started off with the right creep factor vibe and sets you up to be spooked and wanting more. It fizzles when you realize this is a movie that you'd see late at night on a Lifetime channel you stumbled upon.
Again, it wasn't BADDDD, but it just doesn't seem worthy of barely more than 5 stars. My feeble analogy of it is that it equates to a person dressed up in a great outfit with a great speech written to deliver, but the outfit wasn't accessorized to its greatest extent, and the speech lacked a certain quality and magnitude.

For the most part a lot of it is how I remember. Changing from Gage to Ellie didn't bother me at all and neither did any other change but the ending though?! Why! It just made the whole thing laughable and silly. What was the point in her killing and bringing everyone back? The original made a lot more sense. A man loses his child, brings him back to life only he's not his son anymore and kills people. But why would Ellie kill them only to bury them and resurrect them it just makes no sense to me.

1217,jowyroo,"An unremarkable, safe and passable remake",3,15 April 2019,"The 2019 remake of pet semetary is a bland and forgettable film that doesnt take any risks. I have never read the book, so im judging the film on the film.The child acting is pretty horrendous, especially from the main daughter, who is one of the main characters, so I felt that they at least needed to get thay right, but they didnt. Im not sure if it was a casting problem or a directing problem, but regardless it was sort of a make or break aspect of the film and is one of the reasons why it didnt really work.
For such a dark and creepy story, the film lacks in visuals greatly. There are almost no creepy visuals or atmosphere, the cinematography is bland and flat.The directing is unremarkable and there is no style to this film whatsoever.Now i'm not sure if it was a studio thing or a MPAA thing or maybe just a LAZY thing but there is very little violence or gore. Every time something happens that could help towards the mood and feel of the film, (for example the Truck Accident scene) instead of showing anything to make the film frightening or memorable (ie the car accident scene from Hereditary) instead they just chose to cut away and show the daughter in the bushes. That and many other scenes have a lot of missed opportunity, which sort of sums up how I feel about this movie, a great story with a lot of potential to be a truly terrifying film, however due to the studio wanting to make as much money on this film as possible, and going the safe route, it just becomes a movie that no one will remember in a year.",Pet Sematary

The only positive review I can give is that the creepy atmosphere in both the pet cemetery and beyond the barrier works. As for the rest of the movie, rewriting the story and ending as they did makes for a real nightmare. Hollywood needs to stop ruining original ideas and start creating masterpieces from other sources. Make a new Stephen King movie? Sure, but do one that's never been done, like the Long Walk. This was just one long snore with 3-4 good jumps in it. 1 Star is too much for this bore.",Pet Sematary

1220,beldair,"Generally rushed, disappointing.",6,6 April 2019,"Just to make this clear, I'm writing this as a standalone review, meaning I'm not using any comparison to the 1989 original.From the very start of the film there is a very discomforting aura, but it has nothing to do with the scares of the film itself. The start of the film is very oddly paced, to the point where it is noticble that scenes are being cut short and mix matched by the editors. But this pacing issue disappears about half way through the film, suggesting the only concern for the editors were time limitations.Moving onto the key scene where Gage is almost obliterated by the oil truck, and Ellie is most certainly obliterated by the oil truck. There is a servere lack of anticipation built up in this scene, but the opportunity was certainly there. Instead the entire insident is over within about a minute and this essential turn pike in the film is just another cut short time saving scene. Not to mention the laughably bad post effects that have come strait from 2006 to make Gage and Ellie look like they are about to get hit. As much as I can appreciate that production budgets vary massively between some films, I still can't believe that I witnessed such effects in 2019.To sum up; the acting was decent and I was more than a little surprised by the credits when I saw that Church the cat had 3 body doubles through out the film. The scares were far too predictable, and anyone who has seen any sub par horror film in the last 10 years will be disappointed by the complete lack of suspense created. The film is all jump scares but still deserved more hype than films such as The Nun and the rest of The Conjuring universe films. There is much more of a gripping story to Pet Sematary than the afore mentioned horrors, making up slightly for its use of jump scares.",Pet Sematary
1221,jazzyjan-72784,Sometimes the original movie is better!,4,9 April 2019,"Really wanted to love this version of the movie but I am so very disappointed by it. I am a huge Stephen King fan and Pet Sematary (1989) is one of my all time favourite movies. The 2019 version seems to have made changes for the sake of it and it's not for the better in my view. For me, it lacked the emotional pull of the 1989 movie. The Creed family dynamic in the first movie was loving and powerful (making Gage's subsequent death so absolutely devastating and heart wrenching to watch). In this version the family relationships seemed very lacklustre as does their friendship with Jud. This again deviates from the the original movie and also the book where Jud played a more important and integral part of the story. John Lithgows Jud will never hold a light to the amazing Fred Gwynne who totally nailed the performance in the 1989 movie. Overall this is a very watered down version that does the story no justice at all. The producers might have thought it was clever changing some of the major plot lines about, but the original narrative was already strong, so why try to fix something that wasn't broken. Keeping the plot as it was and just updating the movie to present day would have been much more acceptable. I also missed the 'flashbacks' that featured in the first movie and of course Zelda who was also much scarier in the 1989 version.",Pet Sematary

Comparing the original story line, the movie did not change that much the course of events. However, they applied the classic old horror movie recipe - jump-scares and dramatic music (in scenes when it was clearly not the case) - and transformed the whole product into some cheap stuff.
The way the movie was filmed and put together as an artistic product makes me think of the Discovery TV shows that were showing reconstitutions of murders and strange events --> cheap and almost schematic.

They changed it from Gage to Elli who dies, there's a few jump scares but not really scary and was actually comical at a lot of points. If you gave the original evil dead crew a blockbuster budget and told them to make a pet semitary movie, this would be it. I had a lot of ""army of darkness"" memories while watching this movie. It is really a shame because this is one of Steven King's best books in my opinion. They do drop references to Cujo and and IT. But over all a sad destruction of the source material.

1240,tmangrob,Now this is how the 1st movie should have been,10,11 April 2020,"I don't often write a review, but this movie was absolutely the superior of the original. I like horror, This was indeed that horror I enjoy. No ridiculous comedic pieces like the first movie. I cant say a lot of remakes are that good, but damn this one definitely is. All these negative reviews on here, just don't listen to them if you are fan of true horror. This movie will not disappoint TRUE HORROR Fans.",Pet Sematary
1241,leonnadglisson,Wow can you say disaster?!,1,8 April 2019,"The reviews that say this ""remake"" is better than the original are clearly being paid haha, this movie brought shame to Stephan king. I love King's work I always have but this movie sucked! I suggest watching the original first then renting this at redbox because it's not worth paying to see it in theaters.",Pet Sematary
1242,adamski-85495,Is it worth it?,5,3 May 2019,"This film was unfortunately the biggest disappointment of the year in my personal opinion. Upon hearing that another Stephen King film was being remade, I couldn't wait to see it, but was hugely let down by it. I was that bored with it, I ate 90% of the popcorn before the film was 75% through. The long and short of it is this..the best parts are in the trailer.",Pet Sematary
1243,tinuvielle-55769,Why the remake?,1,25 May 2019,"I don't understand this obsession with remakes. I love watching the original movies. I saw this one at a friend's house but I couldn't wait for it to be over. I have read the book and found the first movie a little scary, this one tries too hard to be scary and does not succeed. The changes they make don't make it any better. I am glad it didn't pay to see this one.",Pet Sematary
1244,corib-07989,Review,4,1 June 2020,"I was not impressed. All of the action happened way too quick, & the ending wasn't worth three suspense at all.",Pet Sematary
1245,cameronhuggins,*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*,10,24 July 2019,"It was a great movie! It was incredibly creepy and the tone is terrific. The music is perfect, it builds up as the situation starts to get intense. The jump scares are on point and the ending(no spoilers) is sad. It has a lot of bad reviews but I thought the movie was amazing.P.s. this is not the original so be warned!",Pet Sematary
1246,zoejenner,Disappointed,4,10 April 2019,"As a huge fan of the book and the 1989 movie, I am so disappointed with how this movie is. Most of the movie looks cheap and basic and the fact that they changed the storyline to Ellie dying instead of Gage is just confusing. There is a lot that has been changed from th book and 1989 film and it's not good and really doesn't make sense.
Th cinematography and whole vibe of the film is great, I cannot fault it for that. The actors are also brilliant. I just wish the whole film was done more accurately.
From a point of view that has never read the book or seen the previous films, I get that it would be a good watch.",Pet Sematary
1247,VelociraptorOG,Disappointing to say the absolute least.,1,8 April 2019,The trailer was phenomenal but I waited 101 minutes for this movie to get better and it never did. Thank god for matinee pricing because if I had paid more than $5 for this disaster I would've been pissed. Sorry Stephen King.,Pet Sematary
1248,rotwhytespare,Alot of 10s really,2,12 May 2019,When I heard they were making a remake of pet sematary I was well looking forward to it but what I just witnessed was just awful simple as no where near as good as the original and just a disaster really everything was so rushed and out of place that it felt like everyone involved in this movie just didn't give a toss so I just can't understand all the 10 star ratings this was lucky to even get a 2 from me and to he honest I just wanna forget I even seen this word of advice if you liked this and haven't seen the original or read the book you should get right on it straight away I'm sure you'll change your views on this crap then,Pet Sematary
1249,blumsteinstacks,Worst than the original,2,10 July 2019,"I will keep it short. I was really looking forward to this movie. And to me it felt short. The changes they made just do not work for me. They took away the soul of the movie and turned it into a cheap zombie flick. The original was tense and flowed a lot better. This version feels clumsy and clunky, and the scares are cheap. I don't get the hype.",Pet Sematary
1250,ginapinder,Disappointing,4,7 April 2019,"Was really excited to see this film but I was left super disappointed.
I found it pretty boring & predictable and they left out some really good material from the original that could have improved it.
They focused too much time on the cat and then rushed a really uninspiring ending.Sad :(",Pet Sematary
1251,kurtgiles,good as the original,8,16 April 2019,"Loved it, it's good how they made it different then the original otherwise it would of been a let down & the twists were great",Pet Sematary
1252,husseykyle,Brilliant,10,11 April 2019,This film is really good and has a really good twist. When the daughter dies you feel the emotional impact of the film.,Pet Sematary
