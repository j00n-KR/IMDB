0,TheLittleSongbird,"Enjoyable, a little blander than the first, but perfectly watchable",7,27 April 2010,"I really enjoyed the first Mighty Ducks film, it was uplifting and fun. And you know what, I liked this film too. It is blander than the first, with the direction lacking in places, the plot predictable and the pacing a little uneven. However, the ice hockey matches are done with real flair, the soundtrack is great, it is well filmed and the script actually has its touching and humorous moments. Emilio Estevez reprises his role as Gordon and does a very good job again, in fact he could very well be the actor who holds the film together, and Kathryn Erbe is a charming Michele. Overall, don't expect a masterpiece, but this is an enjoyable film if given a chance. 7/10 Bethany Cox",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
1,SnoopyStyle,Lost all the joy from the original,3,31 August 2013,"Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is back to coach Team USA for the Junior Goodwin Games in California. Most of the team is back with a few new players. Some of them are really ridiculous. This time the big bad guys are from Iceland coached by an old nemesis. Iceland?? Everything is going well, until Gordon loses his way with all the hype. But the movie is lost way before that.The genuine joy and underdog feel is missing in this. The characters aren't given much chance to develop further. Adding silly players with weird characteristics just dilute the product. Gordon actually said in this movie, ""This isn't a hockey game. It's a circus."" You're so right, Gordon. This movie is as ridiculous as a circus breaking out of a hockey game.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
2,gavin6942,"A Bigger Sequel, But Not Better",5,23 December 2016,"Gordon Bombay is forced to withdraw from the minor hockey league with a knee injury. Much to his surprise, he is given the job of coach of Team USA Hockey for the Junior Goodwill Games in California. With most of the Ducks and a few new players in tow, he sets forth for LA.When you have a sequel, you have to make it bigger and better. This film is possibly bigger, because now the kids are playing in some sort of Olympic-like setting against a team from Iceland. So the pressure is much greater. But is it better? Not really. It's rather flat with no plot development, character development or surprises.Fans of the first film might like this, especially because it will allow them to just relax for 90 minutes and not have to invest themselves. It's a good movie to play in the background. Also, Leah Lail is in it.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
3,view_and_review,A Spectacle,3,15 July 2020,"D2 was a spectacle. I don't mean as in a visually striking performance, but as in an unusual or unexpected event that attracts attention or disapproval. Like a drunk hobo yelling at motorists. From beginning to end this movie was determined to bring itself lower and lower.We can begin with the fact that the plot was virtually the same as the first episode. Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is asked to coach Team USA which is essentially the Ducks plus some other hot shots from around the country. Again, Coach Bombay has to hone the skills of these newcomers, again he has to deal with a bully of an opponent who is way over the top, again he is ostracized by his team, and again he has to apologize and beg to be let back in their good graces.It was a rerun with a few different characters.The movie started off Cumbaya enough. Hendriks sports apparel company threw money at Coach Bombay to coach Team USA and do some other PR stuff for their brand. Bombay accepted the offer, gathered most of his old Ducks team along with the new recruits, and quickly made them a good cohesive team.The first sign of problems came when Bombay was seen dating the trainer for the hated Iceland team. As if dating a beautiful woman who happens to be the team trainer of an opponent makes you disloyal. It was juvenile logic at its finest.Right after that, Team USA got dismantled by Team Iceland. It was a drubbing. Bombay reacted coldly by forcing the kids to practice longer and harder thereby earning him the nickname ""Coach Blood."" Culminating with this loss was the Hendriks rep threatening to drop Bombay as a coach because Hendriks doesn't get behind losers.The very notion that a sponsor would drop sponsorship or drop a coach due to one loss is incredibly absurd. Even the best teams lose! And what sponsor would make being undefeated a condition of sponsorship? Could you imagine Nike telling Michael Jordan, ""We'll pay you to endorse our product so long as you don't lose.""After Bombay's fallout with the team for A.) being mean, B.) dating the enemy, and C.) being corporate (how dare you wear a suit and do photo ops just because you're contractually obligated to), he has a moment of clarity and returns to the team hat in hand. After all, they still have to play Team Iceland again in the finals.Once they got to the finals to play Team Iceland for the second time I would say that they weren't even playing hockey. At one point one of the players brought a lasso onto the ice. That brings to mind so many questions. Then, after getting thumped for two periods, Team USA ditches their Team USA uniforms in favor of their Mighty Duck uniforms.Excuse me, but you are playing for Team USA aren't you? You think it's better to abandon red, white, and blue in favor of a duck when representing America? Ugh!This movie was a farce. A totally nonsensical array of scenes and dialogue with something resembling ice hockey in between. You can miss me with this one.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
4,StevePulaski,Estevez is used efficiently; everything else is used haphazardly,5,22 November 2012,"""This isn't a hockey game, it's a circus."" - Coach Gordon Bombay, D2: The Mighty Ducks.Rarely does a movie character sum up his movie so well. D2: The Mighty Ducks is a circus; a cacophony of conflicts, dopey characters, fighting, eccentricities, miscommunications, clichés, and inpenetrable goofiness. Here's a movie sequel that continues to beat a dead horse into the ground by offering the public a sequel to a Disney movie that can only be liked by reciting the word ""nostalgia"" or ""nostalgic."" At this point, it isn't that The Mighty Ducks films are bad movies in the usual sense, but it's that they are so unambitious, uninspired, and bland that it makes it hard to accept them as ""take it for what it is"" entertainment and harder to like them on the typical ""good movie"" level. Emilio Estevez, still portraying the greatly motivated man driven on the idea of success, reprises his role as Gordon Bombay, who the opening credits show us has gone on to be a minor league hockey player being seriously considered for his first NHL appearance until he injured during a breakneck game.Now, Bombay's chances are done and he talks to a close friend about making money, until opportunity knocks when the idea of him coaching Team U.S.A.'s hockey team in the Junior Goodwill Games is proposed. Bombay quickly signs a suit's contract, bands the Ducks together again, and they quickly rustle up the skills and the motivation to win at this year's event and show audiences that Ducks stick together.Need I go further? Should I mention that the kids are now teenagers, yet are still as brazen and as goofy as they were in the first film? Should I go on to mention that Bombay becomes too consumed with coaching a more honored and admired team, and lets all the pressure gets to his head to the point where he is scolding and yelling at his players? Ned I mention that this newfound consumption on Bombay's part has greatly upset a number of players, fueling Ducks-heckler Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson) to aggravate the players? And do I even need to mention that in the third act the Ducks will discover Tyler's surefire knucklepuck and graciously adopt him to the team? One can also make note of the never-ending barrage of one-liners the film haphazardly includes in order to sound hip, motivating, and high-spirited. When one of the only girl players is called a ""lady,"" she forcefully replies, ""I'm no lady, I'm a duck!"" And when the Ducks face their opponents from Iceland, the crowd chants, ""We will, we will quack you!"" in attempt to see how much the audience can cringe in a small period of time.This is kids sports movie-making 101, although it's not harmful as much as it is non-beneficial to any of its viewers. It provides sweet, genial escapist delight and I believe that's what a number of Disney-movie fans seek, which in that case, renders D2: The Mighty Ducks a success according to them. To me, the film is overly long and winded, still far to content with capitalizing on the surprise success of its predecessor, is chock full of clichés, and anchored by its dull characters and formulaic premises. I guess you can also say I'm getting tired of hearing ""We are the Champions"" at the end of the picture further capitalizing on ""the in-game spirit."" At least the film knows one thing and that's how to properly utilize Estevez.Starring: Emilio Estevez, Joshua Jackson, Michael Tucker, and Kenan Thompson. Directed by: Sam Weisman.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
5,Smells_Like_Cheese,"There are a few too many inspirational speeches and it's totally predictable, but...",6,12 November 2006,"For some odd reason, I liked D2: The Mighty Ducks. Now, obviously, I haven't had the opportunity to see The Might Ducks, you know, the first one? But my friend only had the second and the third, so I'm watching those first and hopefully I didn't have to see the first one to understand the second. But I got the story just fine, not to mention, after reading the summary of The Mighty Ducks, I get the point of the movie.Basically, Gordon now has the chance to coach his Mighty Ducks again, only this time, they are Team U.S.A. They are fighting against the best Pee-Wee hockey teams in the world, including the very nasty, plays against the rules, Iceland Team. Now, if you've seen The Karate Kid, you get where this is going. Of course, Gordon changes and wants to win instead of have fun, leading the team into stress, and again, if you've seen Rocky, you get the point.See what I mean by how predictable it was? Not to mention how many inspirational speeches there were, I was getting a toothache from how many there were, they were so sweet, it was unbearable. But I thought that it was a fun family film that the kids would definitely get a kick out of. As silly as it was, it is a good film for the kids, for morals, you know? :-D But, just sit back and enjoy, you never know, you might like it as well.6/10",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
6,ironhorse_iv,"What the Puck!? This movie makes no sense. Despite that, it's still a guilty pleasure watch of mine.",6,16 March 2016,"As a kid of the 1990s, 'The Mighty Ducks' trilogy (1992-1996) was one of my favorite sport movies at the time. It's the movie that got me, interested in hockey. It had a very positive message about teamwork, sportsmanship and overcoming adversity. However, the sequel to the first movie does have the most faults, out of the three. It's something I can't overlook. Directed by Sam Weisman, the movie has Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) returning from the minor leagues after a major knee injury forced him out. While rehabbing he is offered the role as coach of Team USA in an international hockey tournament known as the Jr. Goodwill Games. With that job, comes with him, reuniting with his old Pee-Wee Hockey Team, the Mighty Ducks, as well as a few new players in tow. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I was somewhat disappointing, when this movie came out, because the fact that the Mighty Ducks wasn't going to defend their Pee-Wee Hockey title. After all, I kinda love, the Hawks Vs Ducks rivalry. Still, I did like the new idea of them, playing in a Junior Olympic type settling. It made the games, a lot more challenging, despite D2 follows the same formula as its predecessor. Also, the fact that Team USA is made out of the majority of the Mighty Ducks team, seem very illogical. First off, the team were so bad at hockey in the first movie, that they only made their local hockey playoffs, because another team got the measles. That's doesn't make them, the best junior hockey players the United States has to offer, at all. Also, wouldn't the Ducks need a couple of more wins under their belt, be needed to even, be consider to represented their countries!? One big win doesn't make you, the best. Even Bombay as the coach makes little sense. He has been an amateur coach at a junior level for a single season of local pee-wee hockey. Before that, he was a lawyer. It's not like he was a seasoned coach or player. Also, he was mostly drunk when he coached the Ducks in the first movie. So, how is that, make great coaching!? The fact, that he spent most of the movie, eating up fame, doesn't make it, any better. I think the worst, had to be his roster management. I don't get, why benching all-star goalie named Julie ""The Cat"" Gaffney (Colombe Jacobsen) for the horrible goalie, Greg Goldberg (Shaun Weiss) is a good idea!? Doesn't Goldberg hate being the goalie? Also, what are the rules of this league? How come the other teams, are all males with a single ethnic or social background, but the Mighty Ducks is the only one that has female players and players with different ethnic background? It's very weird. Also, it seem like anybody can join the team, even after the sporting events, happen. A good example of this, is how Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson) is able to join the team, with little to no previous ice hockey experience. Wouldn't the Jr. Goodwill Games committee board, up against that? It's seem like they don't really care for any the rules, if they willing to have players take off their mask, switch uniforms and hog-tie other players without getting ejected from the game. The Ducks don't even get major penalties. Just a 2 minute minor. I really don't get, how Jr. Goodwill Games would allow this to happen. Also, why would anybody cheer Team USA when they become the Mighty Ducks in the end? For most of the fans, the name, the Ducks is totally meaningless to them. If anything, they would be Disqualification for the second half, due to the name change. Even with that, Team USA is not the underdogs in the film. In my opinion, Coach Bombay should be coaching, the Trinidad and Tobago team; a country team that doesn't have snow-like weather nor let alone, an ice rink. Add to the fact; that they are playing in a different country, during the summer months. That team seem to be more like the underdog than the other teams in the film, due to them, being a Caribbean team. Who knows, maybe if they did that, this movie would be a little more memorable, like 1993's 'Cool Runnings', which was about the Jamaican bobsled team, during the Winter Olympics. Instead, Team USA looks like jerks, by completely destroying them; not only with scores, but physically, injuring their players. Despite all that, the movie does have some good highlights. The comedy was mostly a hit than a miss to me. All of the recurring and new characters were great in their roles, even if some of them, were just one-dimensional stereotypes. The hockey scenes were intense, and fun to watch. Even the music by composer, J. A. C. Redford was inspiration. Overall: All this commercial success paved the way for the creation of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, (now the Anaheim Ducks) NHL team as well as a unrelated animated series called 'Mighty Ducks' (1996-1997). While, the sequel is the most cheesy movie of the three films. D2 is still reasonably entertaining. It's a fun nostalgia trip. Recommended to anybody who is a fan of 1990s kid sport movies.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
7,John6Daniels,Ice,7,27 March 2021,"D2TMD movie does not have the same charm as the first. Still a good movie though.The movie is a comedy/sports/children movies. It's the Sequel to Mighty Ducks. This time Coach Bombardy is coaching the USA team while being distracted by capitalism. The DuckUSA go up against an exaggerated peewee hockey villain who coaches a team that look like NHL players.My favourite moment is when they play street hockey.The moment that didn't make sense was Wayne Gretzky meeting team USA. In addition, a Canada VS USA rivalry would have made more sense than Iceland. Where is Iceland anyways?The children have great chemistry with each other. Each character is unique and have personality. Although Brandon Quintin Adams character disappears then shows up then disappears. The kid had talent however, his imdb resume say otherwise.Overall a good movie, still not better than the original.What can be learned? Team Work.Verdict: Keenan in the house. Sorry I had to...",D2 - The Mighty Ducks

9,zkonedog,Addition Of New Characters Vaults This One Past The Original,9,4 March 2017,"The first ""Mighty Ducks"" movie captured the essence of ""hockey humor"". With the addition of some new characters, ""D2"" manages to outshine even its quack-tacular predecessor.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees the Ducks reunite under Coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) as Team USA for the Junior Olympics. Besides the usual team leaders such as Charlie (Joshua Jackson) and Adam Banks (Vincent Larusso), newcomers like Julie ""The Cat"" Gaffney (Colombe Jacobsen), ""Cowboy"" Dewayne Robertson (Ty O'Neal), and Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson), to name but a few, via for spots on the team. The team to beat in the tournament is Iceland, coached by big, bad Wolf ""The Dentist"" Stansson (Carsten Norgaard), who completely intimidates all-comers.""D2"" is better than the original because of the crazy new characters that inject new life into the precedings. The ""old gang"" is still as funny as ever, but every new character in this film is better than any of the originals (save maybe for Lester Averman (Matt Doherty)).This movie pretty much follows along with the same themes as the first one, those being the ""sacred nature of hockey"" and ""having fun over winning"". For those who like sports movies or hockey in general, this one will have you laughing even louder than the first one.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
10,mattkratz,OK sequel,7,23 April 2017,"This movie wasn't quite as good as the original, but few sequels are. Still, it was a decent movie. Estevez returns to coaching the Ducks after his hockey (and return to the NHL) are derailed by an injury, and he winds up coaching not just the Ducks but the USA hockey team. He loses sight that hockey was supposed to be fun and cares more about winning the tournament before regaining his senses and his original vision.My favorite scenes are the party scene, the scene with Wayne Gretzky, the part at the beginning where the bad kids literally get tied up, the game scenes, and the scene where Estevez burns his cardboard image. If you liked the original, you might like this one.** 1/2 out of ****",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
11,r96sk,A disappointing follow-up to a great original film,6,24 September 2020,"Too repetitive and cringey for my liking.'D2: The Mighty Ducks' takes a slightly different path than the original, but by the end it's basically the same film once more. The message(s), while still well intentioned, comes across way more forced this time - not helped by the overall samey feeling, I guess.Emilio Estevez remains the only actor really worth mentioning, the children and villains are very forgettable in this one. Some of the plot lines don't go far either, namely with María Ellingsen's character. There are also a few missing faces from the 1992 film, including Casey (Heidi Kling); her stuff involving son Charlie (Joshua Jackson) is ignored.It's a silly film that can have enjoyment for some. For me, it's a disappointing follow-up to a great original film.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
12,lukem-52760,Harmless Good-Hearted Fun. Estevez is always Enjoyable.,7,13 October 2021,"""D2"" has coach Gordon Bombay (Estevez) back from an injury & with a new job coaching a new team (with a few of the old Ducks kids back) as he prepares them for a competition in California.There's nothing too special about this sequel but its definitely a nice light watch. Mighty Ducks 2 is pure Disney for the family & that's fine as it's a nice Nostalgic 90's feel for it's era it was made & it's a clean & colourful film.I think the first film will always be the Classic of this franchise but all are harmless family fun.Emilio Estevez makes the movie better than it should be because he's such a nice guy presence & I've been a fan of his since i was young back in the 90's. I grew up watching Estevez in Stakeout, Another Stakeout, Maximum Overdrive, Judgment Night, Repo-Man, The Breakfast Club, Young Guns 1&2, Loaded Weapon 1, Freejack & more, the guy is one of my favourite actors who i have alot of Nostalgia for. I miss the 90's when Estevez was a big star.So yeah ""D2"" is a fine little film with plenty of silly kids mayhem, drama, comedy & Heart sprinkled throughout its running time.A nice easy watching piece of harmless entertainment that is full of fun & sometimes we need to watch something like this in life, it doesn't have to be a Classic or anything but just some feelgood fun for abit.Estevez is good once again as Gordon Bombay & this time gets mixed up in the flashy but fake California stars lifestyle as he gets more fame & a bigger ego.Light-hearted lessons & fun all around in a nice easy going sequel.Estevez Rules.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
13,Agent10,Overdone and hammy,4,24 June 2002,"What can I not say about this film. Sure, it had its funny moments (the scene in the clothing store was priceless), this film proved to be an overly sappy collection of gags and bad characters. However, the great inconsistency with this film was the fact that they had a Junior Summer and WINTER Olympics at the same time. Anyone want to clarify this for me? Sadly, the ending also proved to be rather overdone, even with the new uniforms. Unfortunately, this didn't prove to be the last one in the series.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks

16,Min111,The Ducks are at it again,8,28 March 2020,"It's a very good movie - The Mighty Ducks 2. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It's a sequel to ""The Mighty Ducks"". This time, ""The Mighty Ducks"" have an even bigger challenge. The Mighty Ducks team/squad are representing as USA to compete in a global tournament and win! They took on teams such as Trinidad & Tobago and Germany, which they won, but the team that's really in their way are the tournament favourites - Iceland. They lost the first match or early round to them 12-1, so the ducks have their work cut-out if the ducks want to win the tournament and become champions. They, eventually, meet the team in ""black"" again in the final, and The Mighty Ducks win it. If you're into sports or hockey, then this is the movie for you. This movie is for sport fans! There was plenty of hockey-action right throughout the movie. I was surprised just how good ""The Mighty Ducks 2"" actually was. It's definitely an underrated sequel, but I still wouldn't say it was as good as the first one. It's almost good as The Mighty Ducks. The story was good. It's a family movie. It's also a Disney movie. It's a worthy sequel to watch. It's definitely better than the third movie of The Mighty Ducks. It's a favourite movie for many such as myself. It's something you could enjoy watching again. It's entertaining for a large part. I was surprised just how good The Mighty Ducks 2 actually was.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks

18,ryangilmer007,Predictable & Stupid,1,25 January 1999,"This is a movie that shows ""I suck"" at every corner.  Every aspect of the story is predictable as the characters re-do Mighty Ducks One, only in a different format/setting.  There is nothing new about the story.  From the players giving up on the coach to the ducks having to make a comeback to eek out the victory,  actions are a repeat of the first movie.  Besides the feeling of deja-vu, the story line is pure insanity.  Also, there is no ""real"" hocky footage, like the north star game in the first (oh, wait the stars left town).  Anyway, the series should have stopped with this one as The first movie was good.  However, D3 was made and I refuse to waste my money on it.

Gordon Bombay remembers. This movie has so many flaws, can we talk about how Bombay allows his team to switch jersey's at the end of the final game, basically spitting in the face of Americans by stating, ""These kids would rather play as Ducks than as team USA.""

20,blackwidowis7cool,I'm probably the only person in my family to actually love this,9,25 July 2019,"The sequel to the great Champions/The Mighty Ducks isn't as good as the original and doesn't capture the fun and magic of it's predecessor.
But it's still a good sequel.
Bombay (Emilio Estevez) has an accident during a game and comes back to Minneapolis and reunites with the Ducks, who have all grown older, but not anymore sensible than they were in the first one. He and his team are offered a place in the Junior Goodwill Games in Los Angeles and he accepts. In Los Angeles, the Ducks, however, start to fall apart. They begin losing the games and forget how to have fun. Bombay tries to bring the team back to its former glory, but to do so, needs to remind of himself of what really counts.
It's slightly more serious than the first one. The kids get up to more shenanigans, which are somewhat painful to sit through. It may be stupid, but hey, that word applies to the first one, if you think about it. It's just as fun as the original and I quite agree with one of the reviewers - if you like the first one, I don't see why you won't like this one. It teaches a good lesson, and is just brainless fun and laughs.
Emilio Estevez is back as Gordon Bombay, which I am so glad about. It wouldn't be the same without him. He's a great actor in this and, to borrow a phrase used by another reviewer, he's the glue that holds it together in this movie along with Joshua Jackson, who plays Charlie Conway. This movie and its predecessor wouldn't be as good without Estevez.
Joshua Jackson - who plays Charlie - is better than in the original. He's older, more mature, but still the cheeky, fun-loving boy that stole our hearts and Bombay's in Champions/The Mighty Ducks.
Everyone does a good job.
The 'villains' - their opposing team, the Icelanders - leader is somewhat overdone. They make him laughably 'evil'. Didn't think it was necessary they way they did the leader of the Icelanders, but the movie was still good.
Same feel-good cliched ending, but I still love this sequel.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
21,RestlessRust,Flawed but good,6,23 January 2001,"The first ""Mighty Ducks"" was a funny, redundant (Gordon messes up, Gordon apologizes, repeat several times), light-hearted (just plain light) movie with a solid if formulaic plot.D2 is not nearly as funny.  Let's compare.  First movie:""Ducks?  Why are we the Ducks?  Ducks don't even have teeth!""""Neither do hockey players.""Okay, second movie:""Did you guys even practice during the off-season?""""I knew we forgot something!""So it's not funny.  And the plot is full, absolutely FULL of holes.  For example, the Ducks lose one game, so apparently the competition is double-elimination.  The team they face for the championship also loses a game, so both of these teams are in the LOSERS BRACKET.  How can they play each other for the championship?Another:  I'll buy that by some oversight or loophole there is no rule against switching uniforms in the middle of a game, but switching numbers?! There is no way in the world even a rec league would allow that, but here, it's essential to the plot.But for all its flaws, I would still say that D2 is, overall, a better movie than the first.  While both are forgettable, the ""life lessons"" in the second installment are deeper and less obvious (even to the point of being almost contrived) than in the original film.  But it's nice to see a kids movie show that even innocent actions that seem harmless can cause problems. That alone makes D2 an above-average sequel.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
22,Cinema_Love,The last good Estevez movie,9,20 March 2005,"Unfortunetely for us, the Estevez & Mighty Ducks fan, this was the last good ''theater'' movie of Emilio. It is very sad to say but it's the truth. That movie is really funny, you laugh even if it's way too much stupid. The cast play well their characters and they add new characters so it add a bit of fantasy in the movie for their new plot. It's not half the 1st but still it's pretty good! It's your typical fast-food sequel made for the big bucks but hey, they do what they can with that plot, it failed but for the fans it was a success!! Estevez always do movie at that time (D2, Judgment Night, Another Stakeout, Loaded weapon...) that man was everywhere and he was indeed my favorite, that's an actor I really miss!",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
23,meloda,The only decent one of the trilogy,4,16 October 2015,"The first movie is as dull and cheesy as can be. The third is a complete letdown. I loved this one as a kid. Now, I can see how unrealistic it is and kind of dull. That said, it is the best of the three, and at least watchable. It teaches kids about teamwork, and does have a good plot. A lot of interesting moments that are very predictable, but it leads to a happy ending.For a kids sports movie, this is worthwhile. No classic that has stood the test of time, but was good for it's time in the mid-90's when hockey seemed to be more popular nationwide. Worth watching if you have kids to share with who like sports, or if it's on TV and you have nothing better to do on a rainy day.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
24,epicpsychoforce,Rehash,4,25 September 2020,A rehash of the first movie but somehow they made it worse and so cringe. Not a good movie at all.,D2 - The Mighty Ducks
25,dpoll390,Okay...?,4,15 July 2005,"***SPOILER ALERT*** This movie isn't a complete and utter disaster, but it is pretty damn bad. I honestly just think that Disney should have left it alone, but no, they had to go and make a sequel to a really good movie.OK...the story sort of picks up where it left off, Grdon Bombay is in the minors and while playing he receives a leg injury, so he returns back home. Then he's asked to coach Team USA in the Junior Winter Olympic Games. Of course this makes Bombay get all his ducks back together, still missing a few from the first movie, but i think for the most part they were acceptable losses, with the exception of Karp. Then they go off to play, they start to win when...oh my God, surprisingly there's a team better than them that they will have to overcome. And heres the most original part, they face them in the finals...gasp...and even more original than that...they win. oooooo...The humor in this is even less mature and more for kids than the first. Which I think really killed the movie. The characters I think were the only likable attributes of this movie. Especially the addition of Dean Portman.The movie was also infested with music by Queen...watch out.Overall not as good as the first, by any means. 3.5/10",D2 - The Mighty Ducks

27,Normy18,"Same ol, same ol...",3,12 July 1999,"I saw the first version of this movie in the theaters and I thought it was reasonably well done for a Disney movie.  It was somewhat memorable with a few funny lines as well.Then I saw the second movie (only cuz it was free).  Basically it was like watching the first movie again.  The only difference is an unrealistic beginning (even unrealistic as far as Disney goes) in where the kids somehow have managed to forget how to play hockey.Again they start to get better.  Again Emilio becomes a self-centered egotistical jerk, and again the kids bring him around til where they start screaming Quack! Quack!  And again, of course, they do the impossible against a team with 100 times the talent.I believed the first one was worth watching by the average person who generally likes Disney movies.  The second one; rent it for your kids.  Or leave it gain dust on the shelf.  After all, you've already seen it before.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
28,mortenwebstar2,one of the most awful films ever!,1,12 August 2002,"It is very rare indeed that I have to give ""1"" as a rating, but in this case I had to. All the magic from the first ""Ducks"" movie was gone. The plot was boring and predictable, there wasn't any funny lines, and you could say that there wasn't anything in the movie that you could use for anything. Actually the movie could be said to give many children a wrongly subjective opinion on many issues.I rate this 1 out of 10, but only because 1 is the lowest, could I give minus points I would.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
29,Hocklife,If you like hockey stay away!,2,2 August 2008,"This movie is just about rock bottom. It spits in the face of the great sport of hockey. Every game scene is unrealistic or just to dam slow to be real.The characters are dull and forgettable and I know the movie is a comedy but guess what it fails at that to.*To hockey players a few scenes imparticular bug me are the shoot out scene because no one does any of those moves or the goalie takes slapshots form 50 feet. Its annoying to see terrible actors playing even worse hockey players. Also the scene where Russ Tyler comes 40 ft out of the net takes his helmet of and shoots a knuckle puck(Fakest shot ever) and scores a terrible goal to tie the game. The final scene that takes the cake is when the cowboy hockey player from Texas takes goes into the shoot out he does two moves both used in real hockey unfortunately there so out of context they look pointless and accomplished nothing. The first move was the Michigan where he picks it up on his stick. This move is used usually to pick the puck up from behind the net and score. The second move is the ""through the legs"" which is normally only used to get around a defensman.All in all this movie is terrible the only reason it isn't given one star by the decent performance of Emilo Estevez",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
30,Mulder-17,Average Movie,7,2 January 1999,"D2: The Mighty Ducks is just another formulaic teamwork-to-triumph family film.  It has a moderately good script and storyline and is reasonably well filmed.Although better than the first Mighty Ducks, it is still inferior to the third movie.When rated up against other Disney films, it rates an 8/10. Up against other non-Disney films more like 6/10Overall an enjoyable movie for the kids or the older kids-at-heart.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
31,inthecrease77,Hard to watch with all the Flaws,6,4 September 2002,"Its a cute movie but almost the same as the first movie.  I play hockey and its very hard to watch, numerous rules being broke, and the constant equipment changes.   Equipment costs a lot of money, and they all have new pieces of equipment in every game or practice sequence, like new helmets, gloves, breezers, not to mention all the goalie equipment helmets, leg pads and all, at least three different sets (6 for both goalies). *Note all equipment was oversized as well, the helmets should be snug, plus the straps would have to be fastened, you're not allowed to play if they are undone.  Plus their opponents shouldn't even be in the same talent/skill level (like A, B, or C) let alone AGE bracket, besides the fact that they don't have any girls on the other teams.   The refs miss calls that even a non-hockey fan could catch.
  The penalty shot (shoot out) was already mentioned.   And the ""Switching numbers"" mentioned switching jerseys would not be allowed. A goalie with out a mask, the play is whistled down, the time it would take to take off and put on the goalie pads when they switched players. Goalies in the lower levels are not allowed to cross the Blue line. Sorry this movie is So FLAWED its hard to watch!!!!",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
32,lgillard-23208,"It's not about the hockey-such a great, heart warming, exciting addition",9,15 September 2019,"Loving hockey since I was a kid, of course I could point out the flaws. Like the ridiculousness of Dwayne literally lassoing someone. Or how unlikely it would be for Russ Tyler & Goldberg to switch uniforms and gear in a matter of seconds. Or the switching uniforms at the end.However, the movie isn't just about the hockey. We see so much growth in all of the characters. In the first Iceland game the team is devastated when they realized their little antics wouldn't work on a team who has studied them. When Gordon has a moment of clarity, knowing that Hendrix hockey replaced Jack (winning is the only thing that matters.) When Adam has to cope with being benched because of his injury. When Charlie makes one of the most incredibly mature sacrifices and gives Adam his spot when he is healed. And when the team has their ""Miracle"" moment bounding in the locker room.All of that, you can forgive all the wackiness. And as a hockey fan, when you take away the antics, the hockey the kids play is actually really good! They aren't professionals but remember must of them are 12-13 years old, they aren't supposed to be pros yet.So don't watch it for any other reason but to see a feel good, heart warming, exciting movies! I really wish Disney would have stopped with this and ended the franchise on the high.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
33,albertthebrain,worst movie ever......,1,22 January 2005,"this movie is one of the most disappointed and worst movies ever made...... it sucks SO bad. I wish they can destroy every one of the videos and DVD's that has the mighty ducks in it. I also think that if they had to make another ""The Mighty Ducks"", I think they should stop what ever their making. and I think it was one of the most baddest movie that had ever made besides the cartoons of the mighty ducks. I also think they should try and make a better version of the mighty ducks. and if the newer mighty ducks is in the theater, if I still think it sucks, I will think that just about every hockey games would be bad and such.........",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
34,tigerlily5891,I liked it....,10,2 June 2001,"I love these movies...I know they're kinda corny...but hey it was the early to mid-90's...I grew up watching these movies and I get a kick out of them every time.  I just watched the movie for the billionth time on TV and it was like the first time I ever saw it...I still found it exciting (I love sports movies to begin with).  Plus, Joshua Jackson is just the cutest little thing in these movies.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
35,yanks215,"""Greenland is full of ice, but Iceland is Very NICE!""",10,6 January 2007,"I have watched this movie every January for my entire life with my family. Emilio Estevez is a tour-de-force, transcending his father's legacy with his upbringing, wholesome performance as Gordon Bombay, a middle aged hockey player with his one chance to shine with his Ducks.We adore Joshua Jackson in his role as Charlie, the impish scoundrel playing a leader in one of his first feature roles. We appreciate the team effort and the loyalty each of them display.And the Iceland chick is hot. ""I'm Gordon Bombay"" - Bombay ""I know you. I know my competition"" - Wolf StannsonApproved and Co-written by Douglas",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
36,ShortladyAC9,Greatest Quack Attack Hit Ever,10,4 July 2002,"*May contain spoilers* What a movie! For real, this movie was so HOT!  I loved it.  The hockey was great, the story line was excellent, and of coarse, the ducks were at their best.  The new members brought a new outlook of the ducks and a good start to a new friendship.  But of coarse, Jesse Hall (Brandon Quinton Adams) was looking sexier than ever!  I really liked the part when the played Iceland for the championship.  It was well choreographed.  The hostility between the two teams was so real!  So overall, this movie was superb.  I highly recommend it to everyone!  ***** out of *****!",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
37,EmpressClaudia,A Childhood classic for those who enjoyed being a kid.,10,17 November 2004,"I love this movie and the other two movies in this series. I believe that it is the best of the series b/c it was a lot lighter than the other two. My favourite part might have been in the end when everyone is around the campfire and they burst into a horrible version of ""We Are The Champions."" Though it was horrible it was hilarious and very cocky. I'm sure all of us would break into this song after beating everyone in the world in hockey....though it's hard to believe Canada didn't kick Americas asses. I am a fan of Queen also and I believe this movie may have had a great deal with that as well.As a girl I have to say that when I was ten this was the first movie that I saw boys for more than just stupid pricks. If you want to be a kid again watch this movie and enjoy but don't bash it b/c it wasn't made to entertain teenagers and adults.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks

I've never reviewed a film or show, I laughed so hard I had to post something. It's a good movie, I don't know, watch it. Underrated and often left unmentioned decent sequel. Ducks fly together. And the second review helped me big time.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
39,aclott789,The Greatest Film of All Time,10,3 February 2006,"This is clearly above and beyond all other movies ever made and it definitely deserves the number one ranking on IMDb. It's not even close. Why, you ask? Only because it has everything a movie could possibly need. Think about it, you've got Coach Gordon Bombay, Pacey from Dawson's Creek, kids from Morgan Park High School in Chicago(I live a block away!) which actually does not have a hockey team, Keenan's knuckle puck, Team Iceland, Goldberg for comic relief, the team from Trinidad & Tobago whose fans play Caribbean drums after they score a goal, that hot chick from Maine, and We Are the Champions! Come on, it doesn't get any better.Evereybody now, ""Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!""",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
40,CinemaHotDogEnthusiast,Ridiculous but Brilliant,10,26 April 2020,"Overall this movie is another feel good, stay true to yourself and overcome the bad guys with your enjoyment of the game movie. It's enjoyable and good fun. The plot however is simply ridiculous, here are a few of the stand outs for me -At the start of the film the kids skate over a couple of construction workers causing one of the workers heads to get completely covered in cement. Funny antics as a kid but as a grown up I spent the rest of the movie wondering if that guy died and even if he survived why were there no repercussions? It wouldn't have been hard to identify who did it seeing as the kids go EVERYWHERE on skates whooping and quacking loudly as they go.The timescale since the last film - everything at the start builds it up as if he has been away years. He talks about his amazing career, how much the kids have grown, everything's changed, the love interest in the first film is remarried. BUT THEN it's only been a year since their last season win... and since they haven't played another since And the worlds are just starting I'm assuming it's the start of the season which is less than a year. Which leads me to wonder how much ice time could he possibly have had in his ""professional"" career? How on earth did she go from dating him to marrying someone else in that time span? Honestly just made zero sense to all involved.That a one time champion, formerly terrible team ALL get to be on the USA team without any kind of tryouts or qualifications required.In fact, anyone who wants a go can be on the USA team. Little street kid who has never played an ice hockey game in his life?! Sure, you have a ridiculously unbeatable shot come on in. I'm sure the kids working hard in their teams and queuing to audition for a shot won't mind.How aggressive everyone in this team gets. The team USA rep getting absolutely raging at Bombay because they lost one game... Bombay in turn just deciding to hate his team for little to no reason. So angry in fact it borders on child abuse, which raises another question, where are all these children's parents when they are being forced up and down the ice 24 hours a day?Overall a great film, but just a wild and truly unbelievable plot.(Also I'm not a hockey fan, but I'm pretty sure disguising a player as the goalie and having them shoot a goal from the other end of the ice would probably Not be counted if you weren't disqualified for horrendous tactics)",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
41,jchuribal,"Excellent character development, subpar hockey knowledge",7,24 April 2017,"Let me preface this review by saying, wow, what a musical. The pageantry was phenomenal and the character development of Wu would make anyone shed a tear. A few complaints about the hockey performance. I mean the Texas guy is just lassoing people? A memorable quote I drew from this movie was, ""This isn't a hockey game it's a circus"" I also hated when that coach guy was in the business suit or whatever those kids didn't like about it. Dean Portman bullied me through the screen, it was awesome. Also, Goldberg sucked, why didn't he throw in that girl like she was killin it in that first scene with the pucks and stuff.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
42,sweetcoconutfairy,I loved it!,8,20 December 2005,"I've seen all three Mighty Ducks Movies over and over again and I must say I love them all. The movie seemed to be pretty much the same as the first movie as some previous mentioned; they play hockey-overcome the strongest team in the competition and win! Wow, big surprise =[ But other than the scenes that didn't really make sense, the movie was actually really enjoyable for me. Favorite Line-Jessie: Well your brother has a big mouth -akward silence- Russ and his brother shares a look. Ducks: Uh oh Russ's brother: He does, doesn't he?Most memorable scene for me loved it. The acting was realistic, it made me want to be one of them seeing how all the kids were so supportive of each other. My favorite characters were Adam Banks, Goldberg, the Bash Bros and Russ Tyler. Guy got what, like 10 seconds in the whole film and that was in the first 15 minutes when he ""this close"" to kissing Connie. Didn't really like Connie, Ken Wu or the Latino kid, what was their point in the movie again? Anyways a pretty enjoyable movie~!",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
43,b-j-hague,Mixing ice hockey with beating communism...genius!,10,13 March 2006,"From the one liners to the poetic speeches. From Coach Bombays silky slick hair to the hot goaltender; this film oozes Disney, but provides something for everyone. Speaking from an adult point of view, the inability to lose itself from the roots of the first film speaks volumes for the charm of the mighty ducks series. Joshua Jackson performs in a more mature role, allowing Goldberg and the bash brothers to take centre stage.Its a dark story line, with the cool acting by the Iceland outfit is brought into its elements. Yet the colourful theme remains and fun prevails, climaxing in a crescendo of hockey and laughter....And the twist!!! Tarantino himself would have been proud of hiding Kenan Thompson as the tender to perform what became the household catchphrase: ""Knuckle Puck"".The only let down was that it didn't last forever.If you cant appreciate the directed genius of Mighty Ducks 2, you don't deserve eyes to enjoy movies.",D2 - The Mighty Ducks
