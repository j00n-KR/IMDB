0,TheLittleSongbird,The tired and pointless purge,1,9 August 2018,"Disked 'The Purge', apart from the reasonable two leads and a nice gritty look it was tired, poorly written, cheesy, tension and suspense free with annoying characters. Sort of liked 'The Purge: Anarchy', while finding it flawed in especially the writing Frank Grillo's presence livened things up a lot. Had mixed feelings on 'The Purge: Election Year', it had its moments (again Grillo and the committed cast) but the writing, uneven story and characters sunk it.Saw 'The First Purge' as somebody trying to see as many 2018 films as possible and as somebody who had not given up on the franchise. Seeing 'The First Purge', it was wholly indicative that a series that was already starting to flag had completely worn thin. There are no new ideas, anything interesting and even for a prequel it felt completely unrelated to the other 'Purge' films, having none of the few good things present in 'The Purge'. Also saw absolutely no reason for the film to be made or existing. By far the worst of the series and one of the year's worst (have seen a lot so feel qualified to say that).Absolutely nothing worked in 'The First Purge'. Although most of the acting was weak in 'The Purge', the two leads were reasonable. In 'The First Purge', all the acting is lousy, playing characters that are impossible to get behind in a film full of shallow and unrelatable characters that behave so stupidly and illogically, as well as being written in such a biased and not-for-the-easily-offended fashion. Not even the decent production values there is here, the film instead looks cheap and rushed-looking.No tension or suspense at any point and nothing scary or thought-provoking, got nothing enlightening. The pace dragged badly, which undermined the suspense, likewise with the excessive predictability and clichés that were tired well before the film was made, even more tired than in 'The Purge'. The scary aspect is cheap and never surprising, creative or scary, the violence being gratuitous, the situations so ridiculously dumb that it insults the audience and the villains are goofy and flat caricatures, nothing menacing about them. The direction is generally indifferent and the action far from exciting. In summary, awful with nothing redeeming about it. 1/10 Bethany Cox",The First Purge
1,Leofwine_draca,A painful way to spend your time,4,6 February 2020,"THE FIRST PURGE is a prequel to the popular trilogy that they really shouldn't have bothered with. As a prequel it's not of interest at all, because it doesn't add anything different other than having a new group of characters going through that lawless night. Bizarrely, this one turns out to be a blaxploitation feeling movie, with street gangs and psychos all over the place. The problem with it is that the writing is severely lacking, failing to offer the audience any likeable or identifiable characters throughout. There are a few good action scenes but generally this is a painful way to spend your time.",The First Purge
2,SnoopyStyle,intriguing origin story,7,1 October 2018,"The American economy has crashed. The political system is in turmoil. The two party system has fallen and the New Founding Fathers of America has been elected. Dr. May Updale is The Architect of the First Purge and Staten Island has been selected for the experiment. Locals are given $5000 each to participate. At first, most would rather throw big street parties or hide behind locked doors. Individual attacks soon becomes widespread as bigger powers aim to use the purge for their own purposes.A prequel origin story is often unnecessary in established franchises. The purge could be one of those. It's an else-world that has logics of its own. It never made much sense to me but this movie is able to use today's world logic to make it more relevant. With today's understanding, the phrase 'this could happen' gets closer to reality. So the overall franchise premise is enhanced by this movie. That's its biggest contribution. It has the attempt even if it is unable to do it cleanly. The reality of the situation demands more realism from its violence. The lead's superhero antics do not fit. There are a few questionable aspects. The KKK hoods are too on the nose. Staten Island is probably not the right neighborhood. The overall world situation needs more clarity. Despite all the minor issues, the central premise is compelling and it's a good B-movie thriller anyways.",The First Purge
3,Prismark10,A prequel no one asked for,4,8 March 2019,"If you thought the Purge series had run its course, here comes the prequel.The First Purge is a Blaxploitation inspired parody of Trump's America.Making America Great Again means getting rid of the underclass. The poor, the ethnic minorities.When the US economy dives, the two party system collapses and a new movement takes over. The New Founding Fathers of America is the alt right group that is elected.Dr May Updale (Marisa Tomei) is the Architect of this First Purge set in Staten Island. To her this is a grisly social experiment worth doing if it reduces crime and restores the economy.. Local people have been offered money to take part on purge night.On the night of the first purge in Staten Island. Some people want to settle scores, others want to party. Dr Updale discovers that someone else wants people to die and are giving assistance to it.I am not sure having a drug kingpin as the anti hero is the way to go. The film is rather dumb, the series has lost its shock value. The action is fine once it gets going. Even as a satire it could had been done better. It is sad to see Oscar winner Tomei reduced to this kind of movies.",The First Purge
4,claudio_carvalho,Brainless Explanation for The Purge,3,2 October 2018,"The Purge is one of the most stupid American franchise ever. This prequel is maybe the worst film of the franchise since gives a brainless explanation for the origin of the absurd and elitist process of annihilation of the lower classes. The ""hero"" of this first chapter is a drug lord and the non-likable characters are awful. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""A Primeira Noite de Crime"" (""The First Night of Crime"")",The First Purge
5,nogodnomasters,We have our first purge of the evening.,4,28 July 2018,"The first purge was set up as a social experiment on Staten Island. The idea was to pit ""violence against violence"". People were paid to participate in the experiment and we later discover (plot spoiler...sort of) gangs were shipped into the area. The initial purge was to no real surprise, designed to eliminate the lower classes. The film centers on Isaiah (Joivan Wade) who has issues with a crazed killer (Rotimi Paul). Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) is attempting to keep his gang together by boycotting the event. We already knew the politics behind the purge, so the revelation wasn't a breath taking climax. The characters were mostly lame except for Skeletor. Somehow I don't feel bad when poor people kill each other, nor am I entertained by it. I like it when the white bread crowd must defend themselves. Guide; F-word. Brief sex. no nudity",The First Purge
6,kosmasp,Political divide,6,18 October 2018,"If you actually think this movie will divide America further ... I've got news for you: that's not possible. Was I surprised how much they packed in, when it comes to political references and hints and messages (not even really hidden ones) to the current state? You better believe that I was. I did think that it might hurt the movie because people do try to escape when watching a movie not really wanting to see something they see on their news channel all day anyway.But since it was action packed, maybe it could have worked. Seems like it didn't. Some will like it, some will hate it. But it won't convince either side to communicate more with each other. Which just to be clear is not the movies fault! Don't put that on the movie. It still has the premise we ""loved"" in the movie series which will obviously carry over to the TV show. And it works, if you let it and can see past the ""agenda"" or are with it anyway ... The criticism is there and to be honest, it doesn't seem that far fetched or stretched ... especially with some quotes almost being exact to those in real life ...",The First Purge
7,jboothmillard,The First Purge,5,7 November 2020,"The Purge franchise proved successful with the first three films, and even spawned a short-lived television series (taking place in between the timeline of Anarchy and Election Year), but this fourth film is a prequel, showing how it all started. Basically, it opens with deranged drug addict Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) discusses his dark thoughts, including his desire to ""purge"" and unleash his rage on others, the employee talking to him says that this could be very soon. In an alternate 2014, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) are the most powerful party in the United States. In 2017, NFFA chief of staff Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) and sociologist Dr May Updale (Marisa Tomei) announce an experiment, the ""Purge"" to take place on Staten Island, New York. For 12 hours, 7pm to 7am, all crime, including murder, theft, arson, and rape is permitted for all citizens, in order to release their inhibitions in any way they choose. The NFFA offers all citizens on the island $5,000 to stay during the experiment, with additional compensation if they join the Purge and survive, and they have tracking devices in them so they will know if they try to leave the island. All police, fire, and medical emergency services will be unavailable during the 12 hours. Drug lord Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) tells his dealers that they will not be leaving the island, as he does not to draw too much attention to himself and his business and tells them to stay in a safe house and lay low. Dealer Capital A (Christian Robinson) defies this order and goes out to Purge, while newbie dealer Isaiah (Joivan Wade) is attacked and injured by Skeletor. Isaiah goes to his sister and Dimitri's ex-girlfriend Nya (Lex Scott Davis), who is against the Purge, for treatment. As people leave Staten Island, Nya joins her friends Dolores (Mugga), Luisa (Luna Lauren Velez), and Selina (Kristen Solis) in a church to wait out the Purge. Dmitri has stayed behind, and two prostitutes, Anna (Maria Rivera) and Elsa (Chyna Layne), are sent by his dealers to his office to keep him company. Skeletor commits the first-ever Purge murder, and the video footage of it goes viral. The NFFA that are hardly any parties, but ore parties taking place, and that the only crimes are looting, vandalism, and disorderly conduct, instead of murder. Isaiah secretly joins the Purge to get his revenge on Skeletor. They come into confrontation with each other, but Isaiah cannot bring himself to shoot him. Isaiah runs off and into more purgers, before hiding and calling Nya for help. The two prostitutes are revealed to be Purgers who attempt to kill Dmitri, but he fights them off and learns that Capital A sent them to try and take over Dmitri's business. On the streets, Skeletor captures Nya and attempts to rape her, but Isaiah wounds him and they escape. Capital A and his crew go to Dmitri's office to thank Anna and Elsa for killing Dmitri, but Dmitri and his gang ambush him and kill them all, except for the prostitutes, who are told to leave and never return. Nya and Isaiah return to the church to see a white supremacist gang covered in blood leaving it. Although Nya's friend Luisa and her daughter Selina survive, the fate of Dolores is unknown. They all return to Nya's apartment, where Dolores eventually arrives safely. Meanwhile, at the NFFA headquarters, Updale becomes suspicious of a sudden increase in murder, and many masked participants. She reviews the video footage of the Purge and notices vans of masked killers arriving on the island, she is horrified to realise that the said masked participants are trained mercenary groups killing multiple civilians. Sabian explains that the mercenaries were sent to make the experiment look successful, and eventually to help balance the wealth imbalance amongst the rich and the poor. Updale protests this tampering and artificial population control, realising that the NFFA only wants to eradicate unemployed and poor people to create a stronger economy. Knowing that his corruption has been exposed, Sabian has Updale taken away and killed, and erases footage of her death. Dmitri and his gang escape through the streets, until they are attacked by unknown assailants, they are revealed to be mercenaries sent by the NFFA. Dmitri and his crew decide to take a stand against them and protect the neighbourhood. After saving local shop owner and friend Freddy (Steve Harris) and his associates, they go to Nya's apartment building to try and save her and her friends, but NFFA drones shoot and kill most of Dmitri's gang. Dmitri calls Nya to warn her of the invasion by mercenaries, and he is coming to help her. Dmitri successfully kills several mercenaries and while Nya's group hide in a safe space. A second group of mercenaries are about to fire a rocket-propelled grenade when Skeletor arrives and eliminates some mercenaries before he himself is killed. Dmitri grabs a piece of plastic explosive, throws it, and shoots it repeatedly until it explodes, killing the remaining mercenaries. Moments later, sirens sound that signal the end of the Purge. A wounded Dmitri is hailed as a hero, and he states that the survivors must somehow fight back. During the end credits, Sabian reads a statement calling this experimental Purge a success, and that a nationwide Purge may begin as soon as the following year. Also starring Mo McRae as 7 & 7, Jermel Howard as Lorenzo, Siya as Blaise, and Derek Basco as Taz. This fourth entry in the franchise is a reasonably good origins story, it doesn't go into much detail about how government approved the legal crime sprees, but it doesn't matter. The political and ethical issues are seen discussed, the survival of the fittest premise remains brutal, and there is a good amount of blood spill and explosions, not scary but tense when it needs to be, an interesting dystopian action horror thriller. Worth watching!",The First Purge
8,Woodyanders,There's nothing like your first purge,8,11 November 2020,"The third political party the New Founding Fathers of America rise to power in a strife-ridden world. They decide to assert their authority by coming up with a social experiment called the purge in which all crime is legal for 12 hours. The first purge is held in an impoverished community on Staten Island where the residents are more than ready to fight back when the purge gets out of hand.Director Gerard McMurray keeps the bleakly absorbing story moving along at a snappy pace, maintains a chilling dark tone throughout, generates a good deal of tension, and stages the exciting action with rip-roaring flair. James DeMonaco's gutsy and biting script is loaded with plenty of stinging social commentary on such deserving targets as civil unrest caused by a floundering economy, the rich exploiting the poor (people are paid to either stay on Staten Island or participate in the purge), a nation divided by two groups on radically opposing sides of the fence, and government corruption (mercenaries are sent in by the government to ensure the first purge is a success). Moreover, McMurray and DeMonaco manage to slip in a positive message about strength in unity amid all the violence and brutality.The sound acting by the capable non-star cast helps a lot: Y'lan Noel as noble drug kingpin Dimitri, Lex Scott Davis as the feisty Nya, Joivan Wade as the basically decent Isaiah, Mugga as the sassy Dolores, Patch Darragh as smarmy Chief of Staff Arlo Sabian, and Rotimi Paul as unhinged junkie Skeletor. Token name Marisa Tomei does well as eager social scientist and purge creator Dr. Updale. A purge that's well worth taking.",The First Purge
9,ma-cortes,"Regular prequel , middlingly paced ,with lots of thrills , violence , gore and guts",5,30 December 2019,"Passable prequel , but inferior to former entries , being set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future with chills, shocks and loads of violence . This thrilling picture results to be a futuristic yarn full of kinetic energy and amazing stunt work . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , and a weird atmosphere with dark with a surprising ending . The known and unrealistic premise of ""The Purge"" developing in the first installment is the following : The idea behind this whole futuristic America is that the Economy is down and Crime is up , as authorities put a lot of emphasis on murder being legal , that's why they believe assassinations would get better problems . It is just universally accepted that the cause of all these troubles is built up aggression within the human population. In order to correct this, the United States Government testing a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community . As the goverment decides that it would be a good idea to give the public a day to ""release the aggression"". So, one day of each year, they will have an annual ""Purge"" where all crime is legal , including killing . Somehow, magically, this does help the Economy and Crime overall is down for the rest of the year. Because if people get out all that anger in one day , they will not feel the need to commit any more crimes for the rest of the year . Sometime in the 21st century, turmoil has caused the government to be overthrown by the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA). This third installment revolves around the first annual purge night , organized by the party nowadays governs : The New Founding Fathers of America's (NFFA) . NFFA members Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) and Dr. May Updele (Marisa Tomei) announce an experiment to take place on Staten Island where for 12 hours, people will be allowed to purge and release their inhibitions in any way they choose . The NFFA offers residents of the Island $5000 to stay in their homes during the purge and a compensation for those participating as well . They also give the participants a peculiar outfit : tracking devices , contact lenses with cameras in them so that they can monitor all activity . While Drug lord Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) tells his dealers that they will be leaving ; however , the dangerous drug dealer Capital A (Christian Robinson) wishes to stay and purge . A crazed drug addict named Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) talks on camera about his dark thoughts , including his desire to ""purge"" and unleash his hatred on other citizens . Later on , another young drug dealer, Isaiah (Joivan Wade) , gets into a struggle with Skeletor . Meantime , the good mother Luisa (Luna Lauren Velez) is looking for her child . After that , Isaiah goes to his sister Nya (Lex Scott Davis) , an anti-Purge activist and Dimitri's ex-sweetheart, for treatment, and Nya later confronts Dmitri as she believes that Dmitri is Isaiah's drug lord , which he denies . Along the way some people have to confront a really ruthless gang of masked killers . Citizens , join the first Purge .Purged . For one night only, America invites you to its annual tradition . Keep America Great .Purge for the People .Purge for the Nation . Purge for the Power .Purge for Your Liberty . Purge for the Glory. Witness the birth of an American tradition. Citizens, join the Purge. A nation reborn. It Changed Our Country. It Challenged Our Beliefs. Now, Witness How It All Began. Witness the birth of an American tradition. It Changed Our Country. It Challenged Our Beliefs. Now, Witness How It All Began. The movement that begun as a simple experiment...The film is a comic-books style story , set in a dystopian nearly future , plenty of energetic action , shootouts , extreme violence , thriller , surprise-filled entertainment and high body-count . The tale is a blending of ordinary Sci-Fi movies , such as : Escape from N.Y , 2013 : Rescue in L.A. , Doomsday , and even Mad Max series , taking parts here and there . Instead of attempting to be a terror movie , it turns a fantastic thriller/action film set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future about a group of people trying to survive on a night where it's all-out war on the streets . It displays a motley plethora of characters , pretty well but succintly drawn , giving ordinary performances by its entire cast . This stirring movie is packed with frenetic action , crossfire , tension , thrills , chills , and lots of blood and gore , including throating-slit , cold-blood shots , beheading and anything else . The nail-biting action scenes are uniformly very well done , and the suspense and intrigue are enough to keep you interested throughout the film runtime , even in the low parts of the picture . This so-so Action Thriller was the third movie in the ""Purge"" trilogy (2013-2018) and the first was ¨The Purge¨with Ethan Hawke , Lena Headey , following : ¨Purge : Anarchy¨ that even has earned more money at the box office than its predecessor , starred by Frank Grillo , Carmen Ejogo , Zach Gilford , John Beasley , Kiele Sanchez , Justina Machado , Edwin Hodge ; third ¨Purge Election¨ with Kyle Secor , Frank Grillo , Elizabet Mitchell until this prequel was made : The First Purge (2018) .This horror/action-adventure film from director Gerard McMurray serves as a former prequel to explain the deeds that caused this violent first purge . This is a decent movie and well set in a post-apocalyptic D.C. , dealing with citizens who will have to fight cruel disguised cutthroats , bands of depraved crazies ; packing frantic action , shocks as well as abundant violence, being professionaly produced by James de Monaco . As James De Monaco is really the true author of the Purge trilogy , Monaco is a good writer/producer and director . He has written the Purge saga and Purge TV series ; and wrote Assault on Precinct 13 , Skinwalkers , Negotiator , Hate , Staten Island , The kill Point series , Crash series . And he has directed The Purge films ; this horror/thriller franchise is formed by The Purge 2013 , The Purge: Anarchy 2014 , Election year 2016 , and The First Purge 2018 . All of them are set in different locations , as the first film takes place in a house , the second film takes place in the streets , and the third film takes place in official locations , as well as D.C. , and The First Purge takes place on Staten Island, New York , in which no character from any of the previous installments will be returning. This ¨First Purge¨ 2018 was shot in Buffalo, NY and doubled as Staten Island, NY ; it results to be an acceptable but mediocre film in its own right and it's worth watching for saga fans , only . Rating : 5/10 . It is highly recommend to anyone who appeals apocalyptic thrillers .",The First Purge
10,Quinoa1984,It feels okay to Purge...,6,6 July 2018,"This is unabashed and unadulterated exploitation, but it is exploitation for 2018. One day people will look at this the same way we look at Wild in the Streets from 1968 or The Running Man. It beats you over the head with a shovel with its message and exposition (oh the script, my god it hurts). But the action is good and bone crunching, the character Skeletor (yes, that's his name) deserves his own fuller movie, and there were some scattered ideas I found compelling and fascinating, especially how the NFFA goes about really kicking the Purge into highest gear as a means of depleting the lowest tax income bracket. It's full of types both white (the one dimensional douche pushing the agenda in the control room) and black (the one woman who is both sassy and funny). But most of the actors are committed to this material, and the blunt force is felt. Again, this isnt exactly a *good* movie - this is one where a woman literally gets her vagina grabbed by a creep in a mask, because again it's a movie with the red MAGA hat as the poster - but I certainly was never bored, and it got my brain going.",The First Purge
11,BandSAboutMovies,The Purge: The Early Years,6,9 July 2018,"The first Purge, that is, the original 2013 film, wasn't all that great. Yet each sequel has done the exact opposite of tradition by being better than the film that inspired it. 2016's The Purge: Election Year ended the 12-hour evening of lawlessness, so where do you go from here? A prequel. Can it live up to where the series has gone over three films?While this entry is written and produced by James DeMonaco, this is the first time he has not directed one of the films, handing those duties over to Gerard McMurray.Ever wondered how The Purge came to be? Well, to push the crime rate below 1% for the rest of the year and restore the economy, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) decided to test Dr. May Updale's (Marisa Tomei, slumming it here John Cassavetes style) theory that a one night venting of aggression would do wonders for people's state of mind.However, the test doesn't happen in the suburbs, but instead in the marginalized, low income, black and Latino neighborhood of Staten Island. Despite $5,000 being given to each Purger (you gotta spend money to make money, I guess) and more money offered for each kill, people decide that they wanna party more than they wanna kill. And that's when the NFFA takes matters into its own hands, sending in mercenary death squads to get the job done.Can protestor Nya and her brother Isaiah survive the night and the attention of the maniacal drug addict Skeletor (the best part of the film, as he owns the screen from the second he first appears)? Will drug lord Dmitri rise up and defend the neighborhood that he's pillaged? Will white people wear Klan hoods and Nazi outfits and burn churches to the ground?Do I even need to answer these questions?That said - I was entertained by this movie, which is both simultaneously wish fulfillment and dire warning. It's also so many movies in one, combining a slasher film with a running movie with a dystopian/post-apocalyptic film, then adding a side of gritty urban drama, a crime movie and finally, an action shoot 'em up. It works if you don't think too much about how The Purge could ever become true. Actually, screw that. Over the past two years, I totally see how it could not only happen, but be endorsed by the American people.This movie isn't going to be escapism from the slowly darkening world outside the theater. It's junk food, sugar-filled candy that conceals a center that we're all finding harder and harder to swallow. If only the world's problems were so easily solved within 12 hours that could unite us all by violence, which in these films, seems to solve everything. The real world is much messier, much more depressing and much more oppressive.That said, if you want to see a Nazi in neon gleaming latex get shot with a rocket, it's pretty much the best pick you'll find this summer.PS - I just read a review that said this was too political. Umm -- have you been watching these movies?",The First Purge
12,Coventry,"Decent prequel. ""The First Purge"" is on par with the rest of the series",5,8 November 2021,"""The Purge"" is one of those film-franchises that likes to confuse people by not numbering the sequels. So, in fact, ""The First Purge"" is actually the fourth, and I'm not too sure if I already saw the third one. Then again, it doesn't really matter in what order you watch them, and this is prequel.In ""The First Purge"", the freshly elected NFFA (New Founding Fathers of America) are about to dry-run their idea of the purge on Staten Island. For a period of 12 hours, all types of crime - including murder - are legal. With the exception of a handful of freaky people, the residents of Staten Island don't seem very eager to kill each other, but the NFFA has a back-up plan to make their project successful anyway.Nothing in ""The First Purge"" qualifies as original or surprising. Street hoodlums into heroes, and the politicians in the ivory towers are the real monsters.

16,view_and_review,I had to watch,5,6 July 2018,"Before you criticize me for watching The First Purge just know that I had to. I've watched every Purge movie so I couldn't just stop. I'm too heavily invested by this point. Every Purge movie has been equally lousy too but I always remain hopeful. I'm so enchanted by the premise that I keep believing that one of these movies will turn out great.For those of you that may be unfamiliar with the premise: the purge is a single 12 hour period observed in the U.S. each year in which all crimes are legal up to and including murder. As was mentioned in The Purge (2013); due to Purge Day overall crime is down, as well as poverty and unemployment. Economically, the U.S. is thriving because of this celebrated holiday. The Purge featuring Ethan Hawke focused on one family and their quaint neighborhood. The Purge: Anarchy widened the scope and followed a band of people throughout a city. The Purge: Election Year followed the politicians and those dedicated to ending The Purge as a holiday. Which brings us to The First Purge.The First Purge is just that: the very first Purge. We get to see how the Purge was introduced and it just so happened to be introduced in Staten Island, New York. There was a financial incentive for the participants to help kick it off. There was no secret as to why it began in a depressed, poverty stricken place like Staten Island since financial incentives would appeal a lot more to those in most need.The First Purge is probably the worst of the four installments. Instead of using subtleties and cleverness to state their message they assumed the audience was dumb and spelled out what was happening and why it was bad. The heroine in the movie is a fearless do-gooder and the antagonist(s) were mostly racist, capitalist white men. Not that I disagree with that, but I do disagree with the absence of tact, discretion and overall intelligence. They could've tried to make the bad guys less obviously bad guys.The Purge, however despicable, remains a concept that is very intriguing. Too bad it's been botched so many times. If they care to make another attempt (which I hope they don't) they really should take the time to make a more intelligent script, less annoying characters and less Gestapo-like plots.",The First Purge

18,neil-476,Not good,5,9 July 2018,"This prequel to the previous 3 Purge films shows an experimental first Purge, limited to Staten Island, with 2 main plotlines. One features the new political party, whose flagship policy this is, unethically taking steps to make sure it succeeds, and the other features the poor and downtrodden of Staten Island, figting for survival with the help of a local crimelord.Ethically, this film is all over the place. We do have some genuine good people (or ""victims"", as this scenario would generally have it), but anybody with any ability to actually do anything is morally compromised to a major degree. 
I'm not sure whether the fact that this film is very black is a Black Panther by-product or not.I hadn't heard of anyone in this apart from Marisa Tomei, saddled here with a fairly thankless part (did she upset Harvey Weinstein or something?). And I think I know what happened to her, but it wasn't made terribly obvious. The lead casting, the local crime boss - it says the actor's name is Y'lan Noel. How do you pronounce the apostrophe, please? And if you don't, why is it there? What letter is missing? And why not simply put it in instead of an apostrophe?

Knowing that she enjoyed the last 3 Purge flicks,I was pleased to find the latest had just come out on DVD, which led to me going on the first ever Purge.View on the film:Stepping away from directing but continuing to script the franchise, the screenplay by James DeMonaco trims a majority of the thinly-veiled allegories of the first 3,to make this the most politically open of the series, via the Purgers being Neo-Nazis and the people trying to survive the night being Latino and African-Americans from the poverty-ridden ""Hood."" Aiming to make a statement on the state of the nation, the need to link it to the series makes the Horror elements stick out of place to the unfolding drama. Going for a scatter-shot of the first Purge night, the flick loses the ""survive the night"" group dynamic which holds the 2nd and 3rd film together, and instead goes for plodding 90's Gangsta Rap stereotypes, (without even a G-Funk score) and muddled nods to the Crips and the Bloods, which leaves the characters looking flat. Staging the first Purge, director Gerard McMurray & cinematographer Anastas N. Michos oddly have the machinery be more advanced than shown in the later films, (and an unexplained gap in no social media) which gives the action some crunch, but due to the toning down of horror elements, leads to little in a threatening mood being created, as the first purge is unleashed.",The First Purge

But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the others, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation....After the poor third film, it was justified by the makers to inject some much needed life into this really interesting franchise. And now this series is going by the way of the Star trek films, Odd ones good, Even ones not so much.To have the film include the rationale and the birth of The Purge is a good move, because we get to hear why these people want to do it, and thankfully it's for more than money and anger, it's for them to make a statement.The film feels like a cross between Escape From New York and Boyz N The Hood, and I get a feeling that people are getting this film culturally wrong, the setting of the experiment is a veritable melting pot of hatred, anger, greed, and sloth.It's topical to say the least, I wouldn't be surprised if this is an actual thing in 20 years, thanks to a few choice people.The cast, although are your atypical characters from a film like this, are great, but the most interesting character, Skeletor, only has four scenes, but he leaves an impression on the film.It references Anarchy more than any of the other films, this is An anarchists dream, just having one night to vent all your frustrations.Although the film is graphic, it's use of CG blood is awful, and takes you away from the film, a few squibs here and there wouldn't hurt, after all, these sort of films make their budget back at least four times over, and there is one instance of Green Screen that has me laughing out loud.Add a little twist involving the four fathers, and The First Purge is a surprisingly fun and sometimes clever film.Just ignore the fact that the main protagonist is a drug lord who has everyone living in fear.....",The First Purge
21,deloudelouvain,It's not getting better,4,19 November 2018,"I remember watching the first movie about The Purge. It was a new story, and even though it wasn't a great movie, the thing it had going was that it was innovative. This movie though is the fourth or so in this series, I lost count, and like most of the times with sequels it just doesn't get any better. We saw it all before, and we saw it all better. Instead of spending money on sequels they should invest that money in a totally new story because let's be honest it's never going to be good anymore. The story is told before and the acting is just average, just the right ingredients to fall asleep during the movie, and that's exactly what I did at some point.",The First Purge
22,Hellmant,Lost a lot of it's shock value this time around.,7,13 July 2018,"'THE FIRST PURGE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The forth film in the popular horror flick series, and a prequel to the others, about the very first annual 'Purge' (a 12-hour yearly period where all violent crime is legal, including murder). The slasher flick was written by series creator James DeMonaco once again, who this time handed directing duties over to Gerard McMurray. It stars Y'Lan Noel, Marisa Tomei, Lex Scott Davis, Mugga, Joivan Wade, Luna Lauren Velez and Kristen Solis. The gory sequel has received mixed reviews from critics so far (just like the others), but it's also a very profitable hit at the Box Office as well (just like the others too). I found it to be the least well made, and effective of the series, but it's still definitely worth watching (if you're a horror movie fan). The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), lead by Dr. May Updale (Tomei), first come up with the sociological experiment known as 'The Purge', in order to reduce the crime rate and restore the economy. It's tested solely in an isolated poor community (of mostly minorities), and people are offered money to participate. The test at first doesn't go as planned, and the NFFA takes matters into their own hands (in order to force it's success). The experiment of course then becomes adapted nationwide, leading to the events of the first three films.The movie is violent and disturbing, just like the others, but it's definitely lost a lot of it's shock value this time around. It also just doesn't seem nearly as fresh and original anymore, or as thought-provoking. I like that it stars mostly minorities though (that's always a good thing), and Tomei makes a nice domineering villain (for a change). I think the film will be a lot more impressive, and entertaining, to those who haven't seen the other three films at least.",The First Purge

24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Middling prequel to The Purge that takes the story back to the beginning,7,10 July 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe residents of a run down neighbourhood in Stratton Island, New York, are given financial incentives to participate in the first ever 'purge', a brutal social experiment in which murder will be made legal for twelve hours at night. While some view the five thousand dollar reward money as something worth fighting for, a lot of resistance is also put up, headed by Dmitri (Y'lan Noel), the local drug dealer who's spotted the potential for rival dealers to eliminate the competition he poses. As the night winds on, and the mayhem spirals out of control, he becomes an unlikely hero as he leads the battle for survival...Only four films (very minor today for a horror franchise, even such a recent one) in, and it's still hard to believe the original Purge film came out five years ago now. In a time of cheap, derivative horror films, the originality and intelligence of it still stands out for me, and it's definitely the best one I've seen in that time. In my review of the most recent one before this, The Purge: Election Year, I said hopefully they would leave it at that (or words to that effect), and that another sequel would ruin it, but here new director Gerard McMurray (in the first film not directed by James De Monaro) takes us back to the beginning, before the first film with 'the first ever purge.'
As original and suspenseful as the first film was, the deeper meaning of it kind of went over my head, and it took the two (admittedly inferior) sequels for the subtle social commentary and socio-economic observation to sink in. In this film, it's an all out assault, portraying how the rich and powerful exploit the poor and ignorant, and how they want to enforce population control in order to bring down their numbers and not be such a burden. Centring on a predominantly black neighbourhood, living in poverty and hopelessness, there is a touch of the Black Lives Matter movement about it, but to be honest it never feels overly heavy handed or preachy.
In terms of being a horror film, it pretty much follows the script of the original trilogy, with the 'Purge commencement' broadcast and the accompanying siren (bruuuuuuuuur bruuuuuuuuuuuuuur bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuur) as unnerving as ever, a genuine sense of being in a desperate battle for survival and one or two really effective jump scenes that will bring a shock to your system. It doesn't reach the heights of the original, but it's certainly no worse than the last two, and McMurray has proved a worthy successor to De Monaro. ***",The First Purge

26,Platypuschow,The First Purge: The First Purge is the worst Purge,4,10 May 2019,"I've said since day one that The Purge is an incredible concept which positively reeks of potential. I love the idea and there is so much that could done with it, but the moment the first film revealed itself as yet another home invasion movie my belief that Hollywood could do it justice diminished.Now here we are with the 4th movie and a prequel no less, they've had 5yrs to think about the concept and what they could do with it. So why is this latest offering the worst?You know what it reminds me of? Attack the Block (2011), that awful British sci-fi movie about aliens that attack a council estate. So we have the absolute scum of the Earth as our protagonists and I'm supposed to cheer them on? Absolutely not.The First Purge does the same thing, our ""Heroes"" are drug dealers, weapons merchants etc who I simply cannot get behind. If a movie has no real protagonists it's DOA for me.Full of the usual fantastic social commentary, incredible aspects of the Purge concept but once again a weak delivery. For the fourth time the concept feels wasted and instead we're subjected to another brainless action flick.The more I think about the concept however the more I question whether it can be done justice. Surely there is someone out there who can do something with it?So in conclusion, The First Purge is the worst Purge.The Good:Lex Scott DavisEvery aspect that embraces the conceptThe Bad:Some wretched charactersStock screamAwful soundtrackEnding is ridiculous",The First Purge

28,Thanos_Alfie,The Start...,5,25 January 2019,"""The First Purge"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch an American political party called the New Founding Fathers of America making an experiment on Staten Island. This experiment is called Purge and the people who will survive from a twelve hours period with no laws will take five thousand dollars. This movie shows us how all started and takes us back at the start of The Purge.I liked this movie because it was interesting, it had a nice plot and some very good scenes. I enjoyed the fact that it presented us the start of the purge and explained us everything behind that experiment because it made me see everything from a different perspective now that I know the truth behind it. The direction which was made by Gerard McMurray it was very good and is obvious in the whole duration of it that he did a great job. Regarding the interpretations, I liked the interpretation of Y'lan Noel who played as Dmitri, Lex Scott Davis who played as Nya and Mugga who played as Dolores and gave something different in this horror movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Marisa Tomei's who played as The Architect - Dr. Updale and Patch Darragh's who played as Chief of Staff - Arlo Sabian.Finally, I have to say that ""The First Purge"" is a nice movie to watch with an interesting plot and some plot twists that you won't expect, something that makes this movie even more interesting. Under the guidance of James DeMonaco who was the director of the three previous purge movies, Gerard McMurray's direction is equally good. If you have already watched the previous three movies then I am sure that you are going to enjoy this movie too.",The First Purge
29,cruise01,Creepy and thrilling but it does start slow and work its way up to make this worth watching.,7,6 July 2018,"The First Purge (3.5 out of 5 stars).The First Purge is a prequel and the fourth installment in its dystopian action horror series of films. The film is entertaining and decent. The first movie was more of a horror home invasion movie. The two sequels following that was an action film were people are given 12 hours to do whatever they want without any consequences. The First Purge literally is the start of its dystopian future. Were the New Founding Fathers of America wanted to test a new experiment. Were people can release all there anger and violence in a 12 hour period. They want to do this experiment on Staten Island. And people who participate are given money. They are given camera contact lenses so the NFFA can track and record there actions. And to see if this experiment is a success. The plot follows Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and her younger brother Isaiah (Joivan Wade) who are living in a low class complex. Isaiah is involved in drug dealing behind his sister's back. While the kingpin drug dealer Dmitri (Y'Lan Noel) is trying to help. But when the purge experiment happens in their neighborhood. Nya holds up in a refuge shelter at a church while her brother wants to find a psychopath that humiliated him. Dmitri tries to stay low and demands his crew to do the same. That they should not acknowledge the idea of killing. When Nya and Isaiah are trying to survive the night. Dmitri and his crew try to help those that are defenseless.The film being a prequel and limiting the concept of Purge on Staten Island as an experiment does start out pretty slow. We are introduced with the characters. Dmitri being the anti-hero, a drug dealer that wants to help people that is defenseless. Especially, during the climax, when he goes in Rambo mode with killing an army of mercenaries in an apartment complex. It does have a slow start. When the siren warning begins, people are all just walking around armed trying to protect their properties. Some decide to set up booby traps for their enjoyment. Some are creeps that try to prey on girls. Some throw a block party. Then, there is a psychopath walking among the people and killing them for fun. And a mercenary group that is killing for sport. The film does have its jump thrills with people popping out of nowhere. And the contact lenses that is used as a camera does add a lighting effect to the eyes which made the people even creepy. Especially, when people are walking down an alley and seeing creepy stares through windows. The film does have some thrills and suspense. The action does pick up in the last half hour of the movie. When Dmitri tries to save Nya and her brother from a group of mercenaries. Overall, The First Purge is a pretty fair film. If you like senseless violence, than this is the movie for you. It does have a slow start and burn with the concept. But it does pick up in a loud, shoot them up action climax. The story this time is getting burnt out and dull.",The First Purge
30,Floated2,Unique and fresh,7,20 September 2019,"Surprisingly seeing as this film has the most reviews since the original film and many of the top reviews here seem to have rated this low and massively negative. As for one, found this film to be refreshing and quite different from the previous three. It stands out more since it is a prequel and shows how the first annual Purge took place.This film currently has an IMDB rating of 5.1 which is the lowest of the four films and It's not too surprising- for one there seems to be more gang related violence, more of an urban/street and hip hop feel (much more hip hop songs are heavily being played throughout- even if it's for a few seconds). Having read several reviews stating that this film is ""racist"" and doesn't feel like the original Purge movie. They went in a different direction and even with its lowest audience rating, this film still was a success at the box office- ensuring for another entry in the franchise (coming 2020?).The acting is a step up from Election Year and the characters are more likable and we'll rounded as well. There is far more intrigue here and it's not completely predictable. The violence steps up a notch with this being the most violent of the series, and there is some decent scenes of mystique. The film also feels bigger and looks a lot nicer, in comparison to the original where if we look back- that looked relatively cheap.Very solid effect. Also more creative designs on the masks and overall costumes. And unlike Election Year, this wasn't preachy. As a whole this felt quite realistic and we can imagine and put into perspective if this annual Purge were real- how we would react.Though one thing which was somewhat jarring is how the lead character of Dmitry was able to survive- as it seemed he got lucky several times. When he was first introduced we were to believe he was the villain but as the film went on, we see he was in actuality the hero. Overall the First Purge deserves a better IMDB rating as it is a step up from Election Year.",The First Purge
31,leonblackwood,Acting wasn't that great but watchable! 4/10,4,30 December 2018,"Review:
I haven't been a big fan of this franchise to date, but this movie was watchable. It explains how the whole Purge concept began, and how the government took full advantage of a bad situation but from an entertainment point of view, it's very much like the other movies. The only reason why this movie stood out from the rest is because you actually care about the characters, who were put in a terrible situation, with no were to turn. Anyway, the movie is based sometime in the 21st century, where the government has been overthrown by the NFFA (New Founding Father's of America) because of the turmoil in America. Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) and Dr. Updale (Marisa Tomei) announce an experiment to take place in Staten Island, where for 12 hours, citizens will be allowed to purge and release their inhibitions in any way they choose. The NFFA offers residents of Staten Island $5000 to stay in their homes during the experiment and compensation for those participating as well. If they accept the money, they have to wear tracking devices and contact lenses with cameras so that they can monitor all activity. Drug lord Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) doesn't want to get involved in the purge, so he decides to flee Staten Island with his companions. His ex-girlfriend Nya (Lex Scott Davis) is an anti-Purge activist, who decides to stay in church during the purge but her young brother Isaiah (Joivan Wade) takes the cash NFFA, so he can get revenge on a crackhead, who stabbed him during a drug deal. During the Purge, Dmitri is attacked by 2 prostitutes who are working for his competition, which leads to a confrontation that ends badly for the guy who tried to take out Dmitri. He soon realises that the government-controlled experiment is not what it seems and that they have brought in missionaries to enhance the trouble in the area. Meanwhile, Isaiah confronts the crackhead Skeletor, with a gun but he's easily disarmed and ends up running for his life. He calls his sister for help, who leaves the church to try and find him. As the government's experiment isn't causing as much destruction as they thought, the missionaries make it seem like the murder rate is really high, by wearing masks and causing mass destruction. Dmitri and his team try to take on the missionaries but most of them are taken out by an armed drones. Meanwhile, Nya and Isaiah finally get together to tackle the purgers, and they make there way back to the church, where they witness the missionaries killing all of there friends. 3 of there friends manage to escape, so they make there way back to there flat. Dmitri then calls Nya to tell her what is happening, and he hears on the radio that the missionaries are making there way to her block, so he gathers as much artillery as he can, and he makes his way to them. Will he save the Day! You have to watch the movie to find out.... It is full of tension throughout and there is a hidden message that makes you question the government today, but the acting was pretty poor. Some of the violent scenes were gruesome, especially from Skeletor who looked quite scary but the 50 Cent lookalike, Dmitri turned out good at the end, even though he was acting like Wesley Snipes in New Jack City through the first half of the film. In all, it's a half-decent movie which is worth a watch but it won't go down as an all-time classic. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Gerard McMurray, who also directed Burning Sands in 2017. He's a fairly new director who hasn't done that much work to date, but he did produce Fruitvale Station which went down well with audiences. As this movie had a low budget, it did make a hefty profit at the box office, so I'm sure that we will be seeing more from this franchise. I just hope that they get some established actors for the next instalment.Budget: $13million

32,TheMovieDiorama,The First Purge will hopefully be the last.,5,6 July 2018,"The infamous low budget political horror franchise finally gets a prequel, and really was the wisest instalment to make. Our eternal question of ""how did the Purge start?"" is answered in an all too familiar formula that is overstuffed with subtextual layers. The NFFA have won the vote and are now conducting a sociological experiment that allows communities to vent aggression, in a bid to cull the population of America. DeMonaco withdrew from the directing chair and focused on writing a screenplay that would further explain the political and economical agendas of the Purge. Marginalised communities raging against oppression, an experiment that enables lower class civilians to reduce their own population by murdering themselves whilst the oppressors gain monetary benefits and make America ""a nation reborn"". The Purge has always been a hot topic, particularly in today's political climate, and the concept remains prevalent in this fourth chapter. The gritty violence and dystopian abstraction does make for some general entertainment, particularly one action scene on a stairwell, and will raise questions involving morality. DeMonaco involves you in this night of carnage, he allows you to cast your own opinion. Consequently, this resulted in his script to be overindulged in various subtextual components that no longer remain implicit. Discussions regarding overpopulation, oppression, crime and politics felt unnecessarily basic, as if he was holding our hand through these ""difficult"" topics. Unable to balance specific elements, he then also tries to tackle the psychological analysis behind the experiment, using an underused and unrecognisable Tomei as the creator of the experiment, yet fails to garner any real interest. It's all too basic and all too familiar. Nothing new is implemented to differentiate this entry from the rest. More uninteresting and underdeveloped characters from a similar community that the other films depict must survive the night where everyone instantly showcases lunacy. Yawn! A prequel brimming with rudimentary jump scares and a lack of conceptual progression.",The First Purge
33,Tweetienator,This One Hits a New Low Level,3,19 September 2018,"The First Purge is exemplary how low the intellectual capacity in Hollywood is nowadays - the ""white"" and ""black"" characters are drawn in such a high level of stereotypes that it almost hurts watching them. The gang-members are the copy of the copy of the copy of some gangsta movie, no better the politicians and other guys and gals around. The First Purge tries (I at least guess so) to add some more political/social comment/agenda to the story but fails totally: if the people depicted are real life people I would not vote for a Purge but for a pure nuclear distinction of the whole human race ;)The first Purge was a fine thriller with some sci-fi elements but with every addition to the franchise the level of the movies dropped and dropped. On top the plot is very slowly and all in all boring and tastes like some overdue cheese: till the first real action got the stage you got a lot to struggle with boredom or sleep or with both.Asked, I could honestly not answer the question if The First Purge or the new show is more bad.A rate of 3 but only because the production and cam work is okay.",The First Purge

It shows how it originated as an experiment confined to Staten Island with the promise that those who stay on the island for its duration will be paid a large sum of money.This time i found it to be far fetched.

As the movie opens, we learn that the New Founding Fathers of America party has risen to power, and in order to solidify their power, are wanting to experiment with a new social program that would allow any and all criminal behavior for a 12 hour period. We then go to ""Staten Island - Two Days Before the Experiment"", and we get to know a number of the movie's main characters, including a brother and sister, a drug ring leader and several others. Tensions rise as we get closer to the experiment... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: James DeMonaco, the writer-director-creator of the franchise, leaves directing duties to Gerard McMurray, whom I have never heard of. Let me say upfront that I have seen the prior three ""Purge"" movies, and that I have enjoyed these in the strangest of ways. Indeed, the idea of a real life ""purge"" night seems super scary to me. However, I did not enjoy this latest installment and I will tell you why: for whatever reason the movie makers, or at least DeMarco, thought that it would be a good idea in this day and age to play up racial divisions and not only that, but depicting them in a way that is reminiscent of the KKK and neo-Nazis. For shame. It is absolutely not fine as far as I'm concerned. What once was a franchise about surviving the night, now has become a (semi)political movie about racism and racial divides. As to the cast, it is a mostly no-names and mostly African-American cast, one of the big exceptions being Marisa Tomei, yes, THE Marisa Tomei (playing the role of the person who came up with the idea of the purge).""The First Purge"" opened wide once again on the July 4 holiday. The (discount) Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was packed to the rafters. Most people in the audience were African-American. I, for one, am done with this franchise. At one point in the movie a church sign in Staten Island reads ""Pray. Not Purge"", as people are getting savaged left and right. The ""Purge"" franchise badly needs some new ideas, as far as I'm concerned. Bottom line: I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience. If you are interested in the concept of the ""purge"", by all means check out one of the prior three movies, but stay away from this one.",The First Purge
38,subxerogravity,I really liked this one!,6,8 July 2018,"It's a good combination of suspense and action, taking place on Staten Island New York, the film is about the very first experiment that would end up being known as the purge. Though Staten Island is far more culturally diverse, the movie concentrates on the idea about the Purge being a good excuse to get rid of the lower social class.I felt that the other movies were more equal on the concepts of who gets purged, and who does the purging. Then again, this movie more so falls in line with the original film rather than it's two sequels, but keeps the action of the two sequels instead of the horror thriller that was the original purge.I also like that while all the movies are set in the future, this one is the only one using futuristic technology, or rather using technology totally available right now, and it makes it look more futuristic than the others.Anyway, the movie starts out slow explaining the story, but picks up really quickly. It's so much fun to watch, especially the guy playing King D, a drug dealer who cares more about his community than the so called government and becomes a clone of Wesley Snipes when he has to save his ex-lady from Purgers. It seems a little over the top than what Frank Grillo was doing in the last two sequels, but it does make for an awesome movie to see.To me that makes it a good movie but not the best sequel.",The First Purge
39,jtindahouse,Forgets everything that made the first three films great,5,22 October 2018,"What a bizarre series the 'Purge' films have turned out to be. The first film blew people away with what a great and original idea it was, yet set the entire movie in a house and focused on one family, completely squandering all the potential. Then in the second film they worked out their mistake and made the best film in the series. Then they took a slightly different approach in the third film and decided to introduce a political twist to the mix. This still worked and that was another great film. Then somehow, and God only knows how a mistake this big could be allowed to happen, they decided the fourth film should be a prequel completely lacking in imagination, creativity, originality or any of the things that made the second and third films so great. Astonishing.'The First Purge' is not a good film. Perhaps I should be happy that it took them until the fourth film to completely muck things up, but that's not how I feel right now. Every single character in this film is completely unlikeable in every way. There is literally not a single person for the audience to root for in this film. Also I'm of the belief that prequels can be a great addition to any series - as longs they add something. They need to enlighten the audience on at least one element. There should be an unforeseen twist of some kind. There was none of that here. It was simply showing the first ever purge and that was it.The problem with a bad entry in this series is that it exemplifies how dumb of an idea the purge actually is. Up until now the movies have been so fun that we haven't really had time to analyse too deeply just how stupid this concept is, but when a film is as boring and stupid as this one you are left with a lot of time to think. That's not a good thing in this case. I was very disappointed with this edition to the series and I think a lot of other people will be too. A very big let down.",The First Purge

The reason behind the Purge is far right wing politics, no doubt a comment on the current political climate, but it doesn't get too heavy regarding the film itself. This is one of the movies that requires little thinking, just put your brain into neutral and enjoy the action. Of which there is plenty. Good banging soundtrack, acting is good enough. My favourite character was a pyscho known as Skeletor, who's face required no mask. He'd not look out of place in a slasher movie. Things do get a bit too far fetched with a one man army taking on the militia but I overlooked that. Good combination of action and horror.",The First Purge

I'm sure you know the basic story; 12 hours, one day a year that any crime is legal-including murder-with no legal consequences to worry about. This movie tells how it all began. A 3rd political party shows up, calling themselves the NFFA-New Founding Fathers of America-and they have Marisa to help them launch an experiment called the Purge, that is supposed to help people release their anger. This first purge is to take place in Staten Island, New York-if successful, maybe it can go nationwide-and it's not mandatory. Residents can leave the island and not play the game. But if they do stay and participate, they get $5,000.00 as an incentive. Y'lan plays a gang leader/drug lord that wants to save the city and becomes a sort of hero of the people-he can't sell his drugs to dead people, now can he? Lex just wants to protect her brother, Joivan, and make it through the night alive. As the end credits begin, there are 2 scenes; The first talks about the results of the experimental night and if there will be anymore future purges-you know the answer if you've seen the other movies-and the second talks about a new 10 episode tv series. Joke or real? You decide.
It's rated ""R"" for disturbing violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.
If you liked the other movies then you should enjoy this one, too. I would buy it on DVD.",The First Purge

43,cjonesas,[5.5] 33% tension,6,22 November 2020,"The fourth movie in the installment, it's the second-worst of the lot IMO; it basically shows Staten Island and its neighborhood.
Of course, that's The Purge - Nobody, in his right mind, looks at the logic factor, but, there's a limit to everything.(-) Average low screenplay(+-) Average acting.(-) No suspense and thrill.(-) Average action. Diluted action mostly.(+-) The last 20-25 minutes of the movie was better with more rushed feelings. But, it's The Purge we are talking about, not Die Hard!Does it do justice to the essence of the Purge? 35% yes.Overall an unsatisfying movie, less of everything and mostly untrue to the essence of The Purge night.Director Gerard McMurray did a not so passable job and ruined all the efforts of James DeMonaco as the Writer & Director of the previous movies.",The First Purge
44,lukem-52760,"An excellent, thrilling & exciting Purge flick!!! Like a modern Blaxploitation movie.",8,11 November 2018,"The first purge was excellent!!!An Action packed ride through the first ever purge night & it was exciting & sometimes scary & so entertaining & with an even more gritty & real vibe to this entry.This Purge is the most Atmospheric of the franchise, this one oozes urban Hood Horror atmosphere & the streets are more dangerous & scary then ever & this has some of the most intense action scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time, this could sit happily next to ""Dredd"" & ""The Raid"" for outstanding action scenes & real intense gritty action.This Purge is the most relevant & the most racially & politically charged, IT'S todays ""Trump"" infested America gone crazy like a nightmare what if scenario, this messed up corrupted America is seen through the eyes of the colourd people & just like in real life they are pushed into a corner & must fight to survive!!!This covered pretty much everything that is against ""Black people"" & what they face in America still today!!!I got the homage right away when we first see D'mitri he's dressed & looks just like Wesley snipes in New Jack City (1991) & there's alot of hints to A nightmare on elm street, like the director merged the two films together & created a masterpiece.This had a real 90's look & feel to it, the cast was excellent!!!""Anarchy"" & ""The First Purge"" are the best of the franchise so far!!! There will be atleast one more hear?The music was really good as it went from urban hip hop to creepy Carpenter style & worked really well as did the excellent eerie cinematography of the scary night it felt scary & suspenseful & the setting was really good in the big tower block in the low income area of staten island.At times this movie felt like a cool gang Thriller & then moved into Carpenter Horror territory & then changed into Brutal ""Die Hard"" style action but all worked fine & was very exciting.The main guy was AWESOME Y'lan Noel as D'mitri the gang king pin of the area & he become the ""Die Hard Style"" action Hero of the movie & he was great very much reminded me of a young Wesley Snipes like he was in New Jack City but with a hint of Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson so YEAH a great lead & i think he could be a big new action star in the making!!!The music is Fantastic in this movie too & there's fantastic cinematography very John Carpenter style reminded me sometimes of The Fog & Escape from New York with its gloomy look & dim street lights & Smoke on almost every street like the fog creeping in & it's very effective to give it that very creepy atmosphere like a proper Horror movie.Also i have to say that the Skeletor drug fiend psycho villain character was scary as hell & actually one of the scariest movie villains I've ever seen & believe me I've seen alot of movies being a movie buff!!!Another great performance was from the young actor Joivan Wade he was excellent!!!All characters are good in this very slick & hip Urban Action Thriller & yes was a fantastic entry into an excellent franchise & my personal favourite.This is grimy gritty brutal action packed entertainment that mixes Grimy & Gritty Gothic Hood Horror with old school brutal Action & sci-fi Thriller & it's perfect movie making that's Fresh & exciting with racial messages & politics tossed around all over & completely Entertaining but i don't care about all the political stuff i was just purely entertained by a sci-fi Horror survival Thriller with a top notch cast & excellent visuals.Deserves a place next to excellent ""Anarchy"" as the two best so far in the franchise.A great old school ""Blaxploitation"" vibe & a visually stunning Sci-fi Action Thriller with a real grim relevant vibe to todays violent hellish America!!!",The First Purge
45,davispittman,The previous films were better,6,16 July 2018,"I didn't dislike this movie, but I also didn't love it. I have not seen Anarchy, but I did see the first film and Election Year. I really enjoyed both of those films. This one just wasn't handled as well as those in my opinion. In the original purge movie, you had better, more experienced actors that commanded the screen better, Lena Heady and Ethan Hawke. And in the third, you had Frank Grillo, who has a great presence about him and can really shine in a franchise like this. I'm not necessarily saying the actors were bad here, but they didn't have that same presence. Also, the main ""hero"" is a gang leader and we're asked to root for him.... not the best character description for the protagonist. The action was more generic than I cared for, although there were some good scares that got me. I will say that I liked the main female protagonist as a character and I liked Marisa Tomei in her role, to be honest I would've liked to see more of her. Overall, The First Purge has it's moments, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to it's predecessors. 6/10.",The First Purge
46,Pairic,Good Origin Story,7,11 July 2018,"The First Purge: The New Founding Fathers of America have won the Presidency and control Congress, now they must deliver on their promises. Instead of Bread they offer a Circus: sociological research suggests a Purge, involving a 12 hour spree of violence, robbery and murder without penalty would be popular. Staten Island is chosen as a pilot experiment and residents are offered $5,000 each to remain on the island during the 12 hours with extra payments if they participate in the purge supplying contact lenses with cameras in them to monitor activity. A community worker, Nya (Lex Scott Davis) tries to get locals to refuse to participate, her ex-boyfriend, Dmitri (Y'lan Noel) drug gang leader intends just to protect his business.When The Purge begins, Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) a psychotic local makes the fist kill on a guy robbing an ATM, he then launches a knife attack on residents holding a block party. Two crazy old women hide bombs in dolls and teddy bears. Things don't go smoothly for Dmitri and Nya and they have to progress through the violent streets. Strange gangs appear from nowhere and shoot up churches and massacre residents at random. Dmitri will have to defend more than his business.THis origin story has echoes of Escape From New York with an island cut off and a derelict urban landscape but he complexity of the developing battles brings Bushwick and it's community fightback against outsiders to mind. Some really disturbing scenes of violence and mass slaughter, not a film for the squeamish. Doesn't play the political satire angle quite as well as it might have. 7/10.",The First Purge
47,masonfisk,& HOPEFULLY THE LAST PURGE...!,3,23 October 2018,The hit series has decided to reverse the clock by giving us a prequel tracing the very first purge trial held in Staten Island where the powers that be used open violence to wreck havoc on the powerless & disenfranchised in the name of a human course correction which ultimately'll serve the greater good of the masses. Yeah they can spew this nonsense till they're blue in the face but this borderline fascist manifesto masquerading as mainstream entertainment slips a little too easily in the mantra currently being chanted by the powerful in our country. One only hopes someone in our government won't view this film as a documentary rather than a signpost for a major change in domestic policy.,The First Purge
48,aidanratesmovies,Sigh...what a waste of potential,1,31 January 2021,"It's a dreadful bore, with poor writing, and an incredibly forced depiction of the Black side of this fictional movement. Everything the film tries to start anew feels so out of place and none of it amounts to anything remotely interesting, while everything else feels like a forced tie in product to the other films before it, never directly addressing them, but largely relying on similar setups and situations that the other ones have already dealt with. The acting is incredibly over the top, the screenplay even more so, never knowing what it quite wants to be or wants to say. The direction is harsh, the tone and look of the film bleak, and it never decides on whether it wants to be a trip to empowerment or a social commentary, both of which the film pulls off poorly. The music is forced, the characters thin, and I can't think of many things positive about the film besides potential that the film so poorly executed. In the end, The First Purge is not only a pointless sequel, but a truly lackluster film, with no agenda but to accumulate some more money for this seemingly never ending franchise.
My Rating: 2.5/10",The First Purge
49,masonsaul,A bad horror but an enjoyable action movie,6,20 December 2018,"As a horror film, The First Purge fails miserably as it relies entirely on jump scares, none of which are genuinely scary or effective. However, it's still an enjoyable movie due to a good pace, good performances from its cast and enjoyable and well filmed action sequences. Overall, it's enjoyable but given the concept and premise it should have been much better.",The First Purge
50,a_chinn,"Weakest of The Purge films, but it remains a flawed but fascinating franchise",6,1 October 2018,"This fourth installment in the fascinating, but flawed dystopian franchise, does succeed in begin exciting and never boring, but as with the prior films remains a disappointment considering the awesome and frightening premiss. However, in this film's favor, it does fill in some of the logic gaps of the previous films, answering some persistent lingering questions in this prequel of the first ever limited Purge on Staton Island, Are people really so depraved to go on killing rampages one day a year? How could the economy and crime rates improve as a result of a yearly purge? Who would benefit from such an event? Much is explained in this installment. The totalitarian New Founding Fathers need this first purge to be a success, so when the brown and poverty stricken residents of Staten Island don't riot and kill, they send in a Blackwater type of group to make sure there are plenty of killings in hopes of turning citizens against one another. When the leader of the Blackwater group is a dead ringer or Ronny Regan, it's not hard to guess where this film's politics lie and the filmmakers opinion of our current president and his divisive style of politics for personal enrichment (At one point, the heroine refers to one of her attackers as a ""pussy-grabber,"" a pretty direct Trump reference.). As with the other films, this one follows a disparate group of folks trying to survive the 12-hour Purge, primarily an anti-purge activist and a community minded drug kingpin. The downside to this film is similar to the others, in that there is not a lot of character development and despite a strong film concept and story set-up, the film quickly devolves into a series of action set pieces. I found this to be the weakest of the series when it came to action and suspense, but it's likely the strongest when it comes to better fleshing out the politics and the logic behind the purge. I'm also disappointed that the series is straying pretty significantly from it's horror roots in the first film and is more and more becoming an urban action film series. The first two films did an excellent job of conveying the frightening anarchy of the purge (the first film was a straight-up horror home invasion story), but subsequent films has felt more action oriented. I much preferred the uncompromising horror of the first films, which seemed to delve more into the darkness of human nature, even if the logic of the purge was less intelligible. Series creator James DeMonaco is only the writer this time and leaves the directing duties to Gerard McMurray, who does a serviceable job, but this film felt less apocalyptic and less surreal than the prior films, somewhat to it's detriment. After having watched this film and having started watching the 10 episode TV event, I think The Purge series needs to either become more political (which this film did more so) or more focused on simply presenting interesting scenarios and chaos (which the TV show is doing more of), but I keep feeling like there's not enough of either in any of these films.",The First Purge
51,robertemerald,Possibly the best Purge ...,8,11 February 2019,"There's a long buildup to the action in this Purge, and while I appreciate that there where numerous details that had to be conveyed so we could all understand all the internal and external factors at play, I still thought that with a little more adroit creativity this time could have been shortened. However, it is worth it. Once the action starts there's no getting off the freight-train of drama, tension and action until the very end. A little more originality to the back stories of the principle characters would have improved the movie overall to my mind (they were a little cliche), but there's no getting away from the irresistible scary masks, the diabolical psychopaths and the evolution of heroes that emerge, all portrayed by a very large, capable and enigmatic cast. A very complicated sequence to direct, film and edit obviously, but here the filmmakers have risen to the challenge to produce one of the most exciting and satisfying Purge movies I've ever seen.

52,rgkarim,Here Comes The Purge!...,7,4 July 2018,"To be human is to be a lot of things, but in this day and age, anger, inpatient, greed, and many times politically inclined. Hence we get the Purge, a way to shed off all the negative energies in one night, by legalizing all crimes including murder. Years ago, we plunged into the series in a horror-like approach, that soon evolved into a much more political, drama thriller. Now, the prequel arrives to try and shed that last bit of light to the creation of the Purge, all while giving us more kills to bathe in. Hi I'm Robbie K and I'm here to share my thoughts on the latest movie to plunge into theaters. Let's see what the fourth installment has in store as I review: Movie: The First Purge: (2018)Director:
 Gerard McMurray
Writer:
 James DeMonaco
Stars:
 Y'lan Noel, Lex Scott Davis, Joivan Wade 
LIKES:Gripping Characters: The Purge has taken many leads to explain the journey of the ""blessed"" event and drop many characters into the throngs of death. This installment, the characters are actually gripping, realistic groups who have personalities and personas that anchor them to the tale. While there are flaws and strengths to exploit, the movie does a nice job developing the crew through the chaos, yet maintaining their core components as they try to survive the chaos unleashed. Even better, the characters that are extreme (much like in the third installment with the candy girl) are limited, helping reel it back to the suspense it wants. Even Marisa Tomei's character has a bit of twist on it, veering away from the one-dimensional route and adding a little more quality to the mix.The Pace: The movie wins points for being able to accomplish so much chaos and carnage, while completing its story in about 90 minutes. This First Purge was very intense, and that led to a more exhilarating pace to entertain and leave you on edge. When the action gets started, and the morally justified bullets fly, the movie's speed only picks up and caps the film off with a nice action plot similar to components of Purge Anarchy (my favorite of the trilogy). The Story Development: This prequel did little to add much in the terms of the overall story than what we already know, but it doesn't mean it's a weak story. On this first night, there are plenty of lives affected and many deeper than half the characters we were introduced to in the first films. Most of these characters tales come full circle in this tale, offering some satisfactory stories to talk about when the credits roll. A nice balance between all the characters was appreciated, as it kept most of the characters in the play relevant. The Setting: It is realistic, it is creepy, and perhaps the most important, very relevant given the political state of affairs. The First Purge establishes the motif well, and turns a simple town, into a coliseum of destruction, which unfortunately could be any city. It's this setting that makes the series feel realistic, playing on a lot of factors that dominate the human psyche today. Needless to say, there is a warning to keep those impressionable minds away just in case. The Action: My friend and I both agreed that the selling point (past the characters) is the action of this film. While there is a horror element to the film, the First Purge is more of an action thriller than anything else. As the drama unfolds, the truth starts to reveal itself, and the characters get fueled up, the bullets begin to fly. The result are a number of sequences that feel part robo cop, meeting Die Hard, Gangster Squad, and a little Equalizer all put together. It is an exciting climactic finish that starts to bring everyone's emotions to full boil. It felt very much at place, and I was stoked to see it tie the whole thing up in a... messy bow. 
DISLIKES: The Gorey Violence: Psycho thrillers will not be bothered by this, but The First Purge is no stranger to graphic kills. Gore, sounds of viscera being pierced, and agonizing moans of death are certainly what you have to worry about in this film. At times, it was acceptable, but at points it was a little unnecessary to go into the detail they did. Sorry guys, but that's not the selling point for me. Dropping the Story Components: The main elements are there for the most part, but there are plenty of other components that got dropped or sloppily finished. Certain characters, a few antagonists, and some creepy relationships that held such potential were left to dwindle in the dust. Some of them they tried to go back to, but for me the execution of these attempts came off as if they had forgotten it up until the last minute. I applaud for the attempt, but these ridiculous characters had small goals to accomplish and could have used a better send off in my opinion. The Weird Cinema Effects: I know, the Purge series has always been about glorifying the insanity of the people partaking in the festivities. This prequel is no different, but they managed to make a slight alteration that tried to mix soundtrack songs into the slow crawl of their faces. These moments didn't quite integrate into the movie well, and even worse, they kind of overused it for me and therefore not necessarily the most relevant to the mix. A minor flaw for me, but still worth mentioning. The Stretches of Imagination: The movie I ridiculous, we all know that, but there are times where their stretching was a little too much. Many of the characters had insane stamina, incredible accuracy, or insane luck that was envious to video game players alike in regards to a character. Yet, when the moment came where it was needed, somehow that god like ability faded away, leaving them vulnerable at the wrong parts. Yes, rounds out the character, but the timing and inconsistency was a little too staged for me. Political Heat: The movie is going to get a lot of things buzzing, for there are plenty of political topics that are fired up in this movie. Racism, poverty, government hesitation, and savagery are just some of the things that are introduced into this movie. It will divide and conquer the audience into two extremes, potentially leading to heated viewings and most likely mimicry in the near future. If you're not looking for hardcore analyses of these topics, stay away from this one. THE VERDICT:  Overall, the First Purge adds little to the story overall, but it at least brings the characters to bat and hit home runs with. It's still creepy, it brings up good topics for discussion, and has an exciting climax to wrap things up, leading to one of the better installments into the mix. However, it is still a series that is far from my perfect, lost to extreme stretches of the imagination, predictable plots of incomplete stories, and an obsession for the gore are the selling points that aren't for me. Don't go if you are easily sickened by gore or political heat, because this movie is going to hit on all these topics. Yet, if you are a fan of this series, or looking for a decent action/thriller, you want to check this out on the theater. However, I believe there will be a better movie coming in further down the line. My scores are: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.5

The First Purge is the 4th installment in the franchise but is a prequel to the trilogy of the first 3 purge films before it. It focuses on the origins of the purge (as well as the first Purge) & why & how the American tradition began!I was looking forward to this one quite a bit, given the mixed feelings I had about the last installment. Which was good but not as good as Anarchy, but then Anarchy wasn't as good as the first Purge so I guess from the 2013 hit to Election Year, that's my (or was) rating for the trilogy. Now this film however, proved to be pretty good! It was bloody, violent, epic & simply ace in all levels! It kept you locked in from start to finish & was epic in itself for being the orgins of the controversial tradition!The only things I disliked was the characters being all over the place & not knowing who was who, it got me lost in a way. Also the chopping & changing seemed a bit all over the place & confused a few things like plot points & the above, characters. They weren't distinguished well enough at points making it harder to know who was who.But overall, the positives outweigh the negatives in this film & it was have to be the 3rd best in all 4, but comparing these films at all is hard given they've all got something great about them.9/10",The First Purge

I find the plot itself to be quite thought-through, not necessarily realistic or logic but with some nice twists and politics. What I didn't like that much is that parts of the movie almost seem like some comic adaption, with a superhero eliminating dozens of well-trained mercenaries, that was just action movies at their worst. But otherwise I felt well entertained and that's what this movie is all about to be honest.All in all this is one of the better Horror movies, even though you shouldn't expect something game-changing. If you are willing to just be entertained without questioning the plausibility all too much, this could be a film for you.",The First Purge
59,IonicBreezeMachine,"A few strong setpieces sprinkled throughout, but lacking in tension, drive, cohesion, or character",5,28 September 2021,"Following a prolonged period of financial collapse and civil unrest, the radical political faction the New Founding Fathers becomes the dominant political party seizing control of the United States. The New Founding Fathers create an initiative where they will test an ""experiment"" in Staten Island, New York where all crime will be legal for a 12 hour period including murder. Those who agree to stay on the island are promised $5,000 assuming they survive with additional incentives for participation. Among the residents we follow are Nya (Lex Scott Davis) an anti-purge activist living in the Park Hill housing project looking after her younger brother Isaiah (Joivan Wade). Nya tries to protect her brother from the influences of her kingpin ex-boyfriend Dmitri Cimber (Y'lan Noel). All three prepare for the purge in different ways with Nya shepherding anti-purgers to safety in the local church, Dimitri corralling the more unruly elements in his gang, and Isaiah intends to kill unhinged junkie Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) in retribution for cutting him. Meanwhile the President's Chief of Staff, Arlo Sabian(Patch Darragh), monitors the Staten Island experiment from a safe distance and takes measures to ensure the experiment is successful.Following the end of The Purge: Election Year, it seemed almost like it precluded further installments in the franchise save for maybe the few remnant New Founding Father believers mentioned over the closing credits. Franchise creator and director of first three Purge films, James DeMonaco, announced after Election Year that the next installment would be a prequel showing the origins of The Purge. This was honestly a point I was hesitant on because prequels are inherently handicapped by the fact the audience knows how they'll end because they need to end a certain way so it makes sense and lines up with prior installments (assuming you don't just throw up your hands and say ""screw it"" as was the case with Prometheus and the Star Wars prequels). Prequels can work, but in order to distract the audience from the foregone conclusion you have to either have a story worth telling or characters who are engaging.... The First Purge has few of those things.Unlike the first three Purges, and that includes the ""first"" The Purge, the film has a major problem with pacing, focus and drive. For the first 40 minutes of the movie there's nothing really driving the plot forward with much of the opening focusing on Nya protesting or shepherding people to shelter, Isaiah doing reckless gangland actions followed by ill-advised revenge actions (which are mostly directionless and ultimately pointless), and Dimitri locking down his businesses and underlings. It's a flabby unfocused screenplay especially since our three lead characters don't tie together until well over an hour into this 90 minute movie. The first hour feels like padding, the sequences in the observation office monitoring the experiment serve no real purpose other than to espouse information that has already been well established since the 2nd film and no new revelations are given here meaning it's just spoon-feeding what was already told to us. The movie's primary antagonist in the first third is an obnoxiously over the top Rotimi Paul as Skeletor and not only is he grating, the movie basically forgets about him once the mercenaries dressed like gangs and far right extremists storm the island until he comes back as a rather stupid Deus Ex Machina.I will say that while the opening hour of the movie is a directionless mess, the final half hour almost has salvageable value. Dimitri eventually figures out there's Mercenaries on the island and basically becomes reluctant protector picking off the mercenaries and saving Staten Islanders. This eventually culminates in a climax where he needs to storm the Park Hill housing projects alone against the mercenaries sweeping the building to save Nya and Isaiah and the movie becomes reminiscent of The Raid and actually becomes entertaining with Y'lan Noel doing quite well as a morally grey action hero. The last half hour was really well done and actually felt like it could've been grounds for expansion to the whole movie rather than just tucked away in the final third but that's what they did. This climax alone doesn't make the movie ""good"" per se, but it did show there was at least some ideas at play which certainly makes it slightly better than the dull and overly contained The Purge, not by much but a little.The First Purge is a very ""meh"" entry in the series. It doesn't offer any new information on the world of The Purge or do anything all that different from the previous two entries and is lacking in both strong characterization or narrative drive leaving the film feeling flabby and directionless. The movie does become more engaging in the climax thanks to a setpiece that brings to mind the likes of The Raid or other claustrophobic action thrillers, but with only a half-hour of good and over an hour of grating directionless mediocrity it's not really strong justification. If you enjoy the series you'll find stuff to like here, but it doesn't reach the level of Election Year or Anarchy.",The First Purge

Law and Order is suspended for a limited...
Actually if you don't know the concept of the Purge then stop reading this review and get back to your cave.The Purge kicks off, but people don't have as bigger appetite for murdering their neighbours as the big-cheeses hoped for.
So they send in death squads to get the ball rolling.
They also didn't count on a plucky bunch of local people and a surprisingly community-spirited drug-dealer .The Purge franchise can never seem to decide if it wants to be a serious horror/thriller film with a comment on the human condition; or if it wants to be a silly slasher-fest.
This one is no exception.The initial concept is thought provoking and as we get to know the characters we can see how people are being pulled off the line of virtue.
The next thing everyone is running around with baseball bats and assault rifles.The bad guys look like they came via the world's most inappropriate fancy dress shop.
We have clown faces, bikers, flasher macs, Gestapo-gimps, Russian paratroopers, even the Klan show up in full regalia - pointy hats and all.The main protagonist is your typical action hero:suitably ripped, and cuts through bad guys like a kid goes through birthday cake.Are there plot holes?
Oh, yes.
Why do the local drug-dealers have an arsenal big enough to hold back the People's Liberation Army? Why hire mercenaries that have trouble fighting, shooting or even standing up when required.
Considering the tech they have why send anyone at all?
But these sort of things happen in every action film EVER!This film is pretty average but bounces along with the required amount of zing. The acting and effects are solid enough for TV, there are some nice action sequences, and (most importantly) it ends before things get too silly.Some people have aired concerns that this movie demonises white people.
I personally didn't see that and I wasn't offended- and as a Brit I would direct people to the quote from Greg Walsh -

It doesn't have the jumpscares for younger people, doesn't have much of a story for adults. In fact, the screenplay is pretty convoluted. The film makes a drug lord from the streets of Staten Island the hero in this movie by fighting back trained black-ops type of mercenaries, Russian soldiers, cops, biker gangs, White, Black, and Red hooded Klansman, Quadcopters that shoot bullets at citizens and his own drug thugs who hire to hoes to snuff him out. Kinda reminds me of Mel Brooks films but without the funny parts. The story is consistently interrupted by fake news footage and politicians on TVs.

68,kjproulx,A Beyond Lacklustre Prequel,2,4 July 2018,"I'm not a big horror fan, but I always appreciate when a great horror flick comes along. When The Purge was released back in 2013, I was very underwhelmed by it, as the premise itself intrigued me enough to warrant a viewing. The biggest issue I had with that film is that it was a country-wide event that was self-contained in one house. When the second film came along I was inclined to give it a chance because it did what I hoped the first film was going to. Now, this franchise has gone n for far too long and we have arrived at a prequel in The First Purge. The idea of going back to the very first purge has potential, but this film lives up to nothing of the sort. Anything good to speak of this franchise has now been killed in my eyes. This is easily the worst film in the franchise and one of the worst films I've seen in 2018, period.Taking place years before the events of the original film, an experimental purge is held on Staton Island in New York. Dealing with gangs, families, and people who just have the urge to murder, this film focusses on many different people, making it a jumbled mess of a movie. The plot of this film is no different than any of the previous installments, aside from not quite making a valid argument as to why these events even take place each year, which is what I felt this film's only job was in the first place. Failing to provide insight as to why this event continues on is just the icing on the cake of what makes this film so dreadfully bad though.Although I'm not a huge fan of the franchise, each consecutive film was at least able to provide characters that had a backstory for you to follow and while this film attempts to, it comes off as lazy writing, stereotyping people and giving them nothing but clichéd backstories all across the board. If you literally go to watch these films based on the fact that people murder each other and you don't mind having zero depth to the characters involved, then this film may slightly please you, but at least in my opinion, your bar for entertainment might have to be pretty low for this one to impress you.On top of these elements, this is a very easy film to nitpick. The First Purge is riddled with jump scares that come out of nowhere (which I can't stand), some of the blandest dialogue I've heard all year, and quite frankly some very lazy editing techniques. This film has a relatively low budget, just like its predecessors, but it's no excuse when the editing and visual effects would be noticeable in a movie that cost a studio ten bucks.As I mentioned, this movie can be nitpicked until the end of time, but there is one particular scene that ruined any hope I had for this film. Surprisingly, this scene involves a character played by Marisa Tomei. I love her as an actress, but I was shocked to see her appear in this film. Her character is only present to spew expositional dialogue that will even seem dumb to young kids. There is a sequence in this film that is shown through a video feed to her character and after the audience witnesses that they're all wearing masks, she literally exclaims that they're wearing masks, so that the viewers will understand those are the people who are choosing to purge. This film has quite a few moments like this and it just had me shaking my head in disappointment.The First Purge hardly has a single redeeming quality, aside from maybe a visual choice of giving glowing contact lenses to the people who choose to purge. That element was cool visually, but that had no effect on the overall movie. When your film fails to have your audience care about who lives and who dies, there's something seriously wrong. I truly felt that one of the most unlikeable characters was one that you're meant to be rooting for, which gave me a very uncomfortable viewing experience. In the end, this movie fails on more levels than its predecessors, so even if you're a slight fan of the franchise, I still don't know if this one warrants a recommendation. The First Purge is garbage entertainment.",The First Purge

72,virek213,Back To Where It All Started,7,8 July 2018,"It was an idea that writer/director James DeMonaco had back in 2013: What if there were a 12-hour period during the night, throughout America, at the start of spring, where everybody's pent-up anger could be released in a spree of looting, vandalism, rape, and mass murder? And what if it were the thing that kept crime and unemployment at bay for the other 364½ days of the year? DeMonaco referred to such an event as THE PURGE, and it became one of the better horror films of 2013 in its original incarnation, where elements of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, STRAW DOGS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD were combined into one very nightmarish brew. It was thus followed in 2014 by THE PURGE: ANARCHY, and in 2016 with THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR.And in 2018, though he had ceded the director's chair to Gerald McMurray, the director of the disturbing but excellent 2013 film FRUITVALE STATION, DeMonaco still had his hand in with the screenplay for a ""Purge"" prequel, THE FIRST PURGE.In this (loosely) fourth film it what has become an increasingly blood-and-profanity-soaked series, we are taken back to how the ""Purge"" phenomena got started in the first place, in 2021, a year before the events that we saw in the original (which was set in Los Angeles). It is intended as an experiment by a psychologist (Marisa Tomei) to be conducted in isolation on Staten Island, though funded by the National Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), the third political party that has arisen to do what they say neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can or will do-which, basically, is allegedly to bring back the American Dream, or whatever that used to be. But as Tomei finds out to her horror, what was intended to be a release valve for people's anger is actually intended, according to the NFFA's chief spokesperson Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh), to expunge ""lower class"" citizens (pretty much people can tell who those people are and what they look like) from the American landscape. When the Purge doesn't seem to have the intended effect that Tomei wanted, Darragh sends in a bunch of outsiders in KKK-type hoods and the familiar ""Purge"" masks to do the job.Apart from Tomei, and the Staten Island drug kingpin portrayed by Steve Harris, THE FIRST PURGE doesn't have any recognizable faces, let alone the FBI agent portrayed by Frank Grillo in the previous two ""Purge"" films (he decided to sit this one out without DeMonaco in the director's chair). We do have a number of sympathetic Black and Hispanic characters in the film. We also have plenty of surveillance sequences from within the NFFA headquarters and out on the streets that, as in the previous films of the series, hearken back to George Orwell's classic Dystopian novel ""1984"", as well as THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND and MINORITY REPORT. And, this being 2018 we're living in, the film is clearly and inevitably intended as a swipe at the White Nationalist movement fueled by the presidency of one Donald John Trump.As a film, however, THE FIRST PURGE, like THE PURGE: ANARCHY and THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR, has fallen into a standard brew of over-the-top violence and profanity, gratuitous sex, and oftentimes overblown acting, partly due to McMurray's direction, but mostly due to DeMonaco having written the screenplay in a way to appeal to a typical 21st century summer horror and action film crowd. If the original 2013 film showed anything at all, it showed that films in the horror and/or action films didn't have to degenerate to that level.I'm giving THE FIRST PURGE a '7' rating based on the original and sinister premise behind it, but it could have been so much more.",The First Purge

In this prequel, the characters are less likeable than ever, with it almost impossible to feel invested in their safety or plight.This film is the definition of mindless, over-the-top violence. Its political themes and current-day references are no longer subtle and just come across as crass.

76,CANpatbuck3664,Another Solid Entry for the Purge Faithful,7,12 July 2018,"Instead of repeating the same crazy and hysterical night, the writer and creator of the Purge franchise (James DeMonaco) went back and they created a prequel with the First Purge. This was probably to avoid stagnation with the franchise and I can get on board with that. When it comes to the writing in this entry, I thought they did a decent job of filling in some of the previous cracks in the mythology. They give the residents of Staten Island a reason to participate in the experiment and the rollout of the idea is done carefully (as much as it can be). I also appreciated that this movie provided a glimmer of hope in terms of human nature. Most people are at least initially reluctant to participate and that's one of the first admissions by the creative team that all of humanity isn't morally abhorrent. So, while I was impressed by some aspects of the writing, they do continue with the same hammy dialogue that all the other movies feature. I respect DeMonaco as a writer and director (even though he's only handling screenwriting duties in this one) but bringing in someone to be more understated with the dialogue would be appreciated going forward.The First Purge features a couple of twists that I won't spoil but I thought they were well handled for the most part. Conversely, The Purge franchise isn't one you can rely on to create memorable characters. The closest we got to a returning hero was the Sargent/Leo Barnes played by Frank Grillo. The First Purge centres around Dmitri (Y'lan Noel), Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and Isiah (Joivan Wade) and how effective their characters are is decidedly mixed. Isiah is almost the audience avatar, anyone who watches the Purge movies likes to think that they'd be out there running the show but as Isiah learns the hard way, its all well and good until you run into some seriously crazy people and you realize how out of your league you are. Nya is probably the most generic of the 3, she's the anti-purge activist and is responsible for delivering the message of the movie. I want to get into Dmitri more later, but while he has a clear motivation and you can understand his point of view, the method to his madness is flawed.One of the returning issues from other Purge movies is that a lot of the acting borders if not falls into chewing the scenery. The most annoying part was Rotimi Paul as Skeletor. I don't want to completely blame him, part of it was his character but I couldn't stand him and when he makes a surprise appearance at the end, I was rolling my eyes so hard. I did enjoy Y'lan Noel as Dmitri, he made for a charismatic lead despite his character and his work in the action scenes closer to the end could have qualified him for a reboot of the Punisher. Lex Scott Davis conveyed a lot of compassion and righteous anger well as Nya and Joivan was capable as Isiah. I was disappointed Marisa Tomei didn't get more to do as Dr. Updale. Casting her as the scientist who came up with the Purge was inspired but she only acts steely and reserved until an improbable tangent undercut her character.The politics surrounding the Purge franchise are never subtle and while I wish they could be woven into the plot with a lighter touch, that idea being shoved in your face continues in The First Purge. If this makes you angry or you disapprove, nothing I can say will change your mind. Maybe putting this franchise in different hands would help it be more organic. I do think that Dmitri is an interesting character, but I also agree with the criticism that he's a drug lord and the movie wants you to just forget that he's destroying his neighbourhood (the movie points it out but at the end, he's celebrated like a hero and it rings somewhat hollow). So, if you're turned off by the message this movie is championing, that's your choice and I won't convince you of anything different. But this franchise has had 3 movies already and if you're shocked that there's a heavy political slant to this, you obviously haven't seen the other 3. I find all the outrage directed at this entry to be puzzling, why is this a surprise to anyone? This was the rhetoric since 2013.The Purge franchise continues to soldier on and while this is a middling entry, I still enjoyed it. The action scenes toward the end were filmed in an interesting way, Y'lan Noel gave a solid lead performance despite the contradictory nature of his character and I still love the potential of this premise. It was one of the big ideas to come out of horror and it's a license to do anything or go any direction and I think we need more of that. The biggest problem with this movie is that instead of dialing up the horror and the thrills (like my favourite Purge movie, The Purge: Anarchy), they doubled down on the politically charged momentum of The Purge: Election Year which wasn't the best aspect of that movie. This movie has a lot to say and isn't afraid to say it and I don't disagree with that message. I want this franchise keeps going but I hope it attracts some bigger name talent. If you got some high calibre actors and a punch up writer for the dialogue, I think they could create something special. If you're a Purge fan, I think you'll enjoy this, but I wouldn't expect this to win over many new converts.",The First Purge

This instalment wisely returns to that last aspect by taking us back to the first 'experiment' purge taking place on Staten Island. It's largely successful, and one of the more effective entries in the series - not without faults, it remains taut and exciting and offering the most direct social-political commentary of any of the movies so far. This series started years before the current political drift to far-right nationalism, but in setting up a concept that works on the division between rich and poor and the cold-blooded machinations of the powerful on the powerless, this series has more to say than it's sometimes given credit for. It's precisely the sort of film that well-meaning types furrow their brows at and shake their hands about, saying 'Look what we've become ... how evil pop culture is'; when in reality missing that it's really saying 'Look where we may be headed'. It's easy to argue hypocrisy about such films, and of course, there is a degree of having your cake and eating it going on; but the reality is that those who watch violent films and play violent games are rarely the people who commit real-world violent acts.

I thought that I would be all purged out by now, but this fourth entry in the film series is a solid prequel - I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. (There is also a TV show set in ""The Purge"" universe, which USA has renewed for a second season, and I'm told that it's pretty good.) I suppose this is a durable franchise because its premise could be explored through countless different characters.The movie has some weaknesses. The pacing is off, and you could argue that the political theme of ""The Purge"" films, though compelling, is getting redundant by now. (There are some specific jabs this time out at Donald Trump and his following; they're heavy-handed, but they're fun to spot.)But ""The First Purge"" is still a suspenseful and disturbing dystopian horror film. It's got a terrific bad guy in Rotimi Paul's ""Skeletor"" psychopath and some surprisingly damned good action sequences. There is another difference here, too - this ""Purge"" is far less campy than the second and third films. There are fewer plot twists, fewer over-the-top characters, and far fewer trippy visuals - it feels more like a straight horror film instead of a zany one. Depending on your preferences, you might find it superior.One more thing - given its obvious love for Staten Island, this film would make a great double-feature with ""Bushwick"" (2017), another thriller which seems like a love letter to its own setting in Brooklyn.

 then it was kind of repetitive but there were a few interested characters like that relationship between the former's gang leader girlfriend and her little brother.
 the movie is mediocre but it's not far worst than the rest.
 it's a B movie and also a horror, thriller of that kind.
 if u are horror fan u can check it out.
 nothing special but don't deserve an F grade. for me it gets the average C grade easily. hope the tv series will be a nice addition to the films.",The First Purge
93,zac-04879,No Connection with the Characters or Story,3,11 June 2021,"Each the characters, the story, and the now-average action falls short when it comes to the sympathy we possess for the tension. The story of The First Purge is obvious and predictable, but the characters and savagery fails to save how terribly boring, dumb and foreseeable the film is.The First Purge's plot sounds thoroughly interesting and you'll most likely engage into the tale, all before feeling disappointment for the lack of interest you feel. The characters are unlikeable and clearly make dumb choices from beginning to end. Although it honestly gets mildly cheesy, the fourth Purge instalment would also have to be the most violent film of the series so far, despite the action being the most enjoyable ingredient in the film.But it's only the violent action that's enjoyable. The rest of The First Purge is predictably boring and you'll very likely miss the ability to connect with the characters and story. After this unnecessary continuation, another Purge film is not needed, or even wanted.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The First Purge
94,darkreignn,"Jesus Christ, that's Jason Blum",7,9 July 2018,"Do you love smart political commentaries about class distinction, segregation, violent and unnecessary racism, and the money-hungry, blood thirsty, power drunk elite? Apparently so does Jasom Blum because even though these ""Purge"" movies are inherently silly and ultraviolent gore fests, ""The First Purge"" is actually a smarter entry in this series then what we've gotten previously. Now, take from that what you will because to be honest with you, the bar wasn't set all that high to begin with.The first ""Purge"" movie (yes, the one with Ethan Hawke) had a very interesting premise that for some reason the producers/director/screenwriters/someone decided to contain to one family and one house. So basically, it was a pretty average home invasion thriller, with the only different thing being the police couldn't come help the victims because the crimes being committed were all legal for 12 hours. The second ""Purge"" film finally expanded its concept into the streets of the city, giving viewers what they wanted the first time around: blood, carnage, violence, and revenge. It improved upon the first and took the hint, allowing its audience to revel in the bloodshed. The third ""Purge"" was kind of a political thriller, featuring the rebellion and uprising of people who would like to end the Purge (I'm not even going to talk about the ridiculously heavy handed political commentary that was thrown into the movie but can anyone say Trump v Sanders?). And the third film in the series honestly might be my favorite one because it is so action packed - it's really a fun, adrenaline fueled movie.And now we get ""The First Purge,"" an HD re-release of the Ethan Hawke masterpiece... no that's not right, I apologize. ""The First Purge"" is actually a prequel taking place on Staten Island, depicting the first ever purge in all of it's depraved glory.I'll be honest: this movie disturbed me. But the more disturbed I felt, the more I wondered if I was disturbed because the movie WAS disturbing, or if I was disturbed BECAUSE the producers knew that the specific content of the film would disturb. Let me explain.""The First Purge"" is an extremely racially charged film. There are literally scenes of white men dressed in full KKK gear, and dressed in SS uniforms, gunning down African Americans. It's eerie, yes, but more importantly than that, it's grotesque. Klansman storm a church and shoot everyone inside. In another scene a man is shown being dragged from a car as it's flying down the street. Neo-Nazi mercenaries go into an apartment building, door to door, and slaughter practically everyone inside. The killing is scary enough, but seeing it be done by merciless racists made it truly despicable, because it made the killing no longer random, but full of hate and venom.BUT does that racially fueled violence make the movie legitimately frightening? It does, but at the same time it doesn't. You see, obviously, practically everyone dislikes racists. Practically everyone also knows that the KKK used to be one of the most violent terrorist organizations around (and the fact that people still join and that the KKK is still around is insane to me - why anyone would ever want to join a cult that's affiliated with atrocious acts of violence is beyond me). So on one hand, watching Klansmen destroy the races they hate is very disturbing and disgusting. On the other hand, it seems lazy and almost insulting for the filmmakers to resort to such an easy tactic to elicit feelings of fear and disgust in viewers. For example, did the killers absolutely NEED to be portrayed as Klansmen and neo-Nazis? No. They could've easily been portrayed as simple militiamen or mercenaries for hire. They were portrayed as racists because someone who was in charge of making this movie decided that to make the concept even more horrifying, the killers should be KKK members and Aryan wannabes. It's lazy, but you know what? It's effective.I've never been more disturbed in a ""Purge"" movie before then I was while watching racist cultist purge their anger. It may have been a lazy move on the part of the producers, but it was also a bold one. I haven't seen a movie this racially charged for a long time, and the fact that this concept was brought up, discussed, and approved takes courage. Because let's be honest - if you're a racist (please don't be one), your hatred and anger towards other races is not passive, and so for this film to show what racists would do when given the opportunity to act in a way where they know their actions will have no consequences, that's daring.And now let's talk about the actually content of the film. When you go see a ""Purge"" film, you really have to lower your expectations. You aren't getting the newest Oscar contender, you're getting a horror action film about people killing other people. And that is what you get with ""The First Purge,"" albeit with the added benefit of the racial violence being so horrifying, and with the truly interesting political scenes about the elites talking about how they can get more people to kill each other. But I know if you want to see this film, the main thing you're interested in is the violence, so let's talk about it. The action in this film has its moments of greatness, and its moments of ""wtf is this."" There's a brilliant one shot take (that ends much too quickly) of a fight in a stairwell that makes for riveting viewing, and there are some other moments of brutal violence that are fun to watch, but unfortunately a lot of the action scenes are cheapened by awfully rendered, horribly looking CGI blood. It's not even CGI to be stylish, it's CGI because I can only assume the producers didn't want to shell out the extra cash, and the cash they put forth towards the CGI blood must've been in the 3 digits because WOW does it look bad. I usually don't mind fake blood, but Holy God did it look atrocious - it was so fake looking that it took me out of the movie completely. But, if you can get past that, the action scenes are entertaining.""The First Purge"" is a smarter entry in this prolific horror series that I would recommend you see. The social and political commentary is legitimately interesting, the storyline is clever, and the plot never feels hamfisted or gratuitous for the sake of gratuity. Yes, it's a horror action film, it's not a mindless one.",The First Purge
95,FelipeCarrillo,A franchise that succumbs without a taste of its own medicine: purgation,4,31 October 2018,"With all the odds in its favor, Blumhouse has released its would-be summer hit in the form of a prequel of James DeMonaco's successful utopia - at least in box-office terms, - aiming at big dividends, mainly, in American cinemas. If this is true, then it'd surely mean the elongation of this overwhelmingly worn premise for a couple of more years on the big screen, not counting USA Network's TV series. ""The First Purge,"" an origin film about the birth of the controversial law that has grossed almost USD$ 320 million since 2013, is, by far, one of the most generic, tasteless and violent movies of the company since, paradoxically, the highly ambitious second installment of this same franchise starring Carmen Ejogo and Frank Grillo.In the eyes of audiences, the first ""The Purge"" was a true-blue phenomenon when it hit theatres because of its edgy, potential background, however, its true achievement was to be one of the founding productions of the magic formula that defines Jason Blum's studio: tight budgets, novel directors, juicy stories, generally, are equal to great films. With DeMonaco at the helm from the very first moment, it could well be attributed to him all the success, but also all the failures from an idea that has been slaughtered mercilessly. In times where overpopulation, war, racism, poverty and depletion of natural resources are problems grabbing headlines day after day, it's attractive, and at some point twisted, to turn and see a cinematographic fiction that raises as a ""mediating"" solution a 12-hour period in which everybody is absolved of legal consequences, all criminal activity is allowed, of course, among them, murder. After the screening, a feeling of dissatisfaction arises in the viewer in response to the decision of the film of embracing modern horror tropes and conventionalities and isolating of a context pulpy in commentaries.The 2013 film used such a violent and controversial premise as a backdrop to build a torpid home-invasion, of course, set up in the typical white, well-off, dysfunctional family's high-tech home. The 2014 sequel was a survival thriller using the interesting core idea mainly as an axis to unfold and push the mundane plot, but also, to a lesser degree, to take their first and shaky steps towards appraisals on elite dominance. Some years later, the third entry came in with multiple advantages, including the ideal setting (American presidential elections) and the perfect release date (Independence Day in the States) both to expose a story to analyze, to criticize and, at least, to talk about the intriguing premise of a no-law America in order to make back its low budget just in its opening weekend, unfortunately, DeMonaco moved in the wrong direction, creating another obviously higher-budget survival thriller, keeping alive his tendency to project pictures with chances for iconicity, keeping alive his tendency to waste the possibilities of a dying franchise that, with a better script and execution, could have been the first award-worthy movie of the studio, long before Jordan Peele's visceral horror denunciation.It was not so, however, motivated by the great numbers of ""The Election Year"" two years ago, the 10-year production Universal-Blumhouse deal started up as soon as possible a movie to ""close"" this agonizing circle. Will loyal audiences turn away from the very first film to be starred almost entirely by African American actors? Will they finally deal the final blow to knock down the misdirected, greedy hopes of these two studies to keep on lining their pockets at the expense of cinematographically offensive offerings? Let's see it.""The First Purge"" is probably the first and unique of the entire franchise that has a really considerable social-commentary dose, still and all its thick-headedness and inefficiency, since if it is compared with its predecessors/successors, Gerard McMurray strives to say something- via bestial, outrageous scenes that find a solution in controversial violence -about caustic inequality, race snobbery, political manipulation and bigotry, all clumsily enclosed in a political bubble that, strangely, never bursts. In his two films, McMurray's always managed to acquire perspectives stirring self-assessment and social feedback, but just as his Netflix grim drama debut ""Burning Sands,"" he comes unstuck overcoming the rulebook of the genre in which his stories are contained to deliver better stuff than many other directors have tried to deliver, especially the black filmmakers.DeMonaco taking a back seat in favor of a ""new"" voice brings on drastic changes into the narrative and visual field; a moderately healthy decision. Although he doesn't enrich the mythos, neither fortifies its origins, he delivers a balanced approach in content but unbalanced in quality, put another way, crafting terrifying pictures takes second place in order to raise an unsatisfactory plotting deepening; unfortunately, neither of the two fields gets truly good treatment. On this occasion, the film doesn't know what it is, a ""Get-Out""-ish social freak out or an unsurprising survival thriller, a dilemma drowned, as usual, by a range of ear-shattering stings. This movie is a shame, bearing in mind that the last hopes were put on this undecided prequel; apparently, one more franchise with wasted chances to transcend its entertainment barriers.From the beginning, this entry fought against one of the most heavy-going obstacles to this-day popular universe-expanding prequels: We already know the end of the story. For this reason, the script, penned by DeMonaco, should defend itself with a standalone-yet-interesting story, tough enough to keep stand from the very first scenes, one nourished by nerve-shatteringly tense sequences, with plot devices developing and evolving the narration altogether, a story with clever, human characters getting rid of hackneyed races against time. Small wonder that it doesn't come out victorious from this requirement. The characters, far from throwing away modern action film stereotypes, are easy preys to meaningless, cat's paws running around and butchering to preserve their lives. Fortunately, unlike the thousands of mindless horror offerings out there, here the relationships between the characters involve a sense of humanity, which automatically causes that, at some point in the film, we worry about the fate of these fictitious individuals.Peculiarly, antagonistic weight doesn't fall on a fixed actor, rather strongly belongs to wicked government intervention distorting the already nefarious experiment. This is one of its few strong suits, however, much like characters, the shallowness of this ""villain"" doesn't even try to fight audience's predictions, falling into ""race against the clock"" field over and over again, a lost race.Y'lan Noel plays the tritely cold-blooded gangster/action hero in a good way, with a strange charm that ends up echoing among the audience. Unfortunately, Dimitri, his character, is portrayed as a violent, vengeful man, two adjectives that clash with the notion of savior in this kind of film. Lex Scott Davis is who delivers the best performance, even if her character is nothing but another indomitable girl; alright, she gets a special plotting push, but, in the end, is one more final girl saved by a super-man. Mugga, the usual Afro-American comedy-horror comic-relief, does quite well her work, is a positive addition to the melodrama that bathes part of the story.I'm absolutely confident that this film will be remembered for two huge disasters: one, R.I.P. promising premise; two, an unfairly wasted Marisa Tomei. They've muted Tomei's character and that's an unforgivable mistake. In the first two acts, the creative mind behind this ""social catharsis"" doesn't say more than six lines - the first one, in front of an egregious green screen -and as soon as the third act kicks off, a certain ""twist"" takes place and destroys everything. Marvel's new Aunt May could have been a dream villain, clearly, with a worthy-of-respect design and treatment; alas, it was the greatest sin of a ramshackle tragedy.""The First Purge"" by Gerard McMurray is just another run-of-the-mill thriller; a rushed B-movie throwback that doesn't even set up DeMonaco's gloomy, eye-catching visual spectacle. But, at the very least, it does achieve to deliver an obtuse edge of complexity to a premise that was on its last legs, burying a meaty context that hardly will resurface, at least, with brand-new stuff. After an insufferably lengthy period of almost seven hours - the four films' runtime belonging to this franchise, - something has happened: the experiment has expired. Mixing together DeMonaco's ever-aggressive pulp imagery and McMurray's improvement of some storytelling purposes, a perversely violent-yet-juicy cinematic cocktail may have come out from all this madness, unfortunately, said utopia will never be a reality; the experiment is over.",The First Purge

There's clearly a polticial message present during the runtime about modern-day, corrupt governmental treatment imposed upon lower-ranked American citizens.

A group of white people went around killing a lot of ethnic people while saying things like ""Get out of our part of town""....Imagine the outrage...And rightly so I might add. Instead we have a bunch of blacks running around killing a bunch of whites and saying things like that. Yes thats an actual quote in the movie. Its uncalled for.

100,TuesdayThe17th,"Is this the end, or the beginning",7,3 October 2018,"Ok so there are many bad reviews for this film. Many are saying this is a rwcist movie blah blah. Truth is, yes the government or NFFA is portrayed in this movie to be targeting the black community as most of the cast are black and everyone who lives in the apartment towers of interest are definitely black. Umm, so what? Do we all have a problem with risky filmmaking? Is that not what some of the most successful and well known horror films are made of? I am an avid horror fan and upcoming director and honestly i think it was a great idea to hand the Purge series over to a black director and let him put out something mainstream for the black film community. It doesnt mean itll stay there. A 5th installment could prove there is still life here. After all, the way the 3rd Purge was headed was very political and racial. I myself think the movie was great. It had the most grit out of the series and the connection between characters was deep and felt, and when a cared for one dies or there is a heartfelt moment, it IS effective. The violence portrated is good, not great. Its not bloody. I have somewhat of a hard time seeing where the budget went on this film, as there was little on screen violence that was actually detailed. I personally loved the main character, Dwayne. He was a badass with a heart. Its hard foe,ke to say where this one stands in the series. A part of me wants to call,it the best.

101,Jared_Andrews,Weak Politics & Powerful Violence,4,12 July 2018,"'The First Purge,' not to be confused with the original 'Purge' film, despite the title issue that will inevitably cause misunderstandings in future conversations about the franchise, isn't much different from the other films in the series. Sure, it dabbles in politics, making an attempt, but it never successfully articulates a message with any thoughtfulness or depth. Any political statement made is merely surface-level and clearly not rooted in anything resembling research or understanding. Other than that, the focus is on violence, which is abundant albeit cheaply made. It feels video game-like at times. The events of the story open with news coverage of a speech from the president elect, who comes from a new political party that bears a likeness to the Alt Right and calls itself The New Founding Fathers of America. The party gained momentum after promising to rebuild the country after an economic collapse. Now the new president has sanctioned an experiment in Long Island that will make all crime legal, including murder, for 12 hours. They call it The Purge.Okay, so now we know how it all started. Sort of. The film would benefit from added exposition on The Purge experiment. I'd like to see more about the scientific backing and the legal process that led to the experiment's approval, but that's not what most viewers paid to see, so I understand. At least the movie made a meager effort to depict the events that preceded the first Purge, even if none of it was very well developed. Thankfully the politics do not overwhelm the movie. The filmmakers seemingly decided to get all that stuff out of the way early, then mention it only a few brief times later amidst the carnage and purging. There's also twist that everyone will see coming a mile away, but that's easy to look past. All considered, the movie doesn't quite beat you over the head with its politics-it's more like a moderate slap to the face. I suppose I applaud the writers for making a socially conscious effort, I just wish they had made a better one.On the bright side, the acting is solid, especially the two leads. They're the most redeemable part of the movie. Y'lan Noel, the leading man, has the makings of a possible star. Hopefully his terrific performance is not forgotten along with an otherwise forgettable movie.",The First Purge

He sees the government as being the villain when in fact he is just as bad as they are.

103,springsunnywinter,Weakest of the franchise,5,8 July 2018,I'm a huge fan of this franchise as I think it is a brilliant concept and I loved the previous 3 instalments.I always wondered as what exactly happened that made the government create this event and this movie was supposed to explain the events that led up to as it is called the first purge. This movie failed miserably to explain that what caused the first purge experiment and became another one night terror film although we already had 3 films that did that.This movie had a perfect opportunity to become more of a political thriller where people and politicians are arguing with each other and try to make the purge experiment more convincing and that would of made it the best film of the franchise. However I't wasn't all bad and I still enjoyed it has another one night terror film and was really dark that made the film a sinister feel to it.,The First Purge
104,scb_coldsteel,Smart idea poor execution,6,1 October 2018,"So I finally watched the new Purge movie at the theater. I've been a fan of the series since the first. No, they are not the best horror movies, but I always enjoyed the premise and they are mildly entertaining.The new film acts as a prequel to the series. Here we get to see the the start of a state sponsored social experiment that would morph into the Purge. From its origins we are introduced to the best aspects of this film. It plays as a direct political satire on far right ideology.This is easily the most directly political movie in the franchise. It directly takes shots at political manipulation, racial inequality, collusion, and gun violence.The movie has a number of smart concepts it wants to address, but that does not make a smart movie. In the end the film plays far more like an exploitation film against those grievances then a horror film.There are absolutely zero elements of horror or suspense in the movie. Unlike the previous films there's not even any cool gore to keep you entertained to substitute for the lack of a coherent story.There is a surprising amount of action in the movie, but most of it was ridiculously unrealistic. For some reason all of the protagonist had super ninja fighting skills that really felt out of place. It was an odd choice that further made this movie more of a B movie action exploitation film.On top of that the movie really didn't have characters as much as they were caricatures. The good guys were gangsters with a heart of gold against the evil government sponsored foreign death squads. Not the most compelling writing.In the end this movie had a message and concept that could have made a good movie. Unfortunately it was weighted down by poor writing, cheesy action, and zero horror elements. It still was a B fun movie and was better than the last two films the series, but no where close to the original. A 5.75 out of 10.",The First Purge

As a prequel, it explains a little bit to be honest, the inner story isn't particularly important. Once the purge starts in all of the films, it's all about survival and the thrilling intensity of such. I really enjoyed this and the ""hero"" of the film. I though 'black John Wick' at one point which is an appraisal and a half in my opinion. Great film, great action, great acting and martial arts. Really enjoyed it.",The First Purge
106,Fields201,The First Purge is the First Letdown of the Series,4,11 July 2018,"It became a tradition with my mom and my nephew to see these Purge movies. We all enjoyed the last one and we all agreed that since we had so much fun with these films, let's make it a tradition! Then comes First Purge....It started out okay. It opened with this drugged out black dude with this messed up head who goes by the name Skeletor, go all crazy and talk about killing people. In front of him is this conservative white dude in glasses. He hears Skeletor say the word purge so I'm guessing this moment inspires the rest of the films.... I guess.So now we see a bunch of news reels and they are conducting an experiment in Staten Island, New York for the first purge event. Poor people are getting paid to stay there and this whole thing is head by Marisa Tomei and some other white dude in a big control room full of other white dudes. I can almost get behind all this because I can see the government targeting poor people and minorities. Heck, they use race baiting on the news to distract them from political events.Then we meet a young black kid named Isiah. He gets harassed by Skeletor and suddenly gets cut. His friend helps him out by shooting at him, and Isiah gets all mad. After this we are introduced to the hero of this film, the main guy, a drug king pin named Dmitri, who has a group of guys working with him and he nearly kills one of his own. I honestly thought he was the villain of this movie, but we soon learn that this is who we are following. His sister (or lover, I missed what she was to him) N'ya is upset with him, but Dmitri shows he cares about her and Isiah and he will protect them on the night of the purge.Of course, he doesn't. Isiah goes out into the night wearing those weird looking eye contacts and is searching for Skeletor. Apparently Skeletor is too busy killing girls at a party, but Isiah finally has a gun to his head and doesn't pull the trigger. Instead, he runs. This endangers his sister as she leaves the church to go looking for him leading to a very stupid scene that we all agreed with where they are talking in the middle of the street instead of hiding. Of course they run into trouble.Everything was fine in this film up to a point. I was enjoying the imagination of the costumes, and there were some creative ideas. But then you realize that this movie is about race baiting. Suddenly there are Klu Klux Klan members, white cops beating a black dude like Rodney King in this baseball stadium, slow motion shots of black people being set on fire, and I'm just waiting for slavery to make an appearance. Then you start to realize that the movie is sending out a message that white people are bad, and the black people are the way they are because of the white people. I hate these kinds of films and for such an enjoyable series, why did they go this route?The last act of the movie was rather dull. I was never really invested in the characters, save for maybe N'ya and Delores, but for everyone else I could care less about. As the film closes, I couldn't really see how this would tie into the other films and felt unnecessary. If you stay in the credits, they advertise The Purge TV series. I think they are a little late on that concept. This movie destroyed any future this series might have.",The First Purge
107,plasticanimalz,Disappointing,4,9 October 2018,"Okay, I know, it's number four, so, what should I expect. But Resident Evil churned out six or more films and the sequels managed to maintain their quality, so, I thought the latest Purge might hold up. While the original Purge was a clever, inventive low-budget indie that was well done, had tension and thrills, this latest Purge is a mediocre to bad B-movie, which, considering the much larger budget on this film...is rather disappointing. Usually more money means more freedom to do more. I have to give my hat to the first film which made something really interesting and original on...I think it was 3 million. That's nothing. I'm not sure why after letting the creating over The Purge write and direct the first 3 films did they hand The First Purge to a director with almost no experience. It shows. Like, a lot. I remember reading that the director took the script and made a lot of edits to it. That shows to. Within the first 5-10 minutes it's pretty bad. I was going to shut it off because I did not have high hopes but wanted to give it a chance so watched the whole thing. Not the worst thing I've ever seen but just not good. Zero tension, zero scares. It would have been interesting to have some mystery to it, instead the first 20 minutes the actors explain to you everything that is happening. Basically, the first 20 minutes are exposition. That is terrible. Usually in a movie a character appears for a couple lines to explain what is going on and let the audience figure out the rest. This movie literally talks you through it. That's aside from the fact that within the first 5 minutes I was like, this would never happen. There's no way some new political party gets elected and they just allow them to experiment on a town and film it. Like, do they understand how politics even work or how much actual power they have? Clearly not. The original film is effective in making you suspend belief that a purge would ever happen, and leaves you thinking. The First Purge is just so utterly unrealistic and at certain points ridiculous. It was rife with cliches, the cinematography was terrible, a lot of the acting is bad, directing bad, camera work bad, writing bad. The only thing it had going for it was a few of the Purgers had interesting masks. There is even one scene where I think the director didn't get his shot so he blacked out the film for a couple seconds then jumped to another moment. I think he was trying to make it look like it was an effect but it just looked like part of the film was missing. The whole thing, drug dealer with a heart of gold was pretty lame. One minute he's a ruthless sociopath and the next he has a sensitive side. Lame. Then he just happens to have ninja skills along with extreme special forces skills and manages to go all Rambo and kill about 50 highly trained mercenaries. Not forgetting to mention the drug dealer also has a stash of weapons in a hideout that makes him look like James Bond. Super realistic. If the dude is this skilled and has a $120,000 car, a super soldier hideout, what is he doing living in the projects? Makes no sense. And what is he doing being a drug dealer? If he's that skilled I'm pretty sure he could find better work. It could have been cool but just wasn't. Oh, and the psychologist who created the whole experiment halfway through the movie starts talking about how the other dude is unethical and how she's going to expose him. Really? Like, what she's doing isn't bad 'cause it's for scientific study? Just ridiculous. And the mask they use on the poster is not even a Purger, it's just some extra at a block party who has no role in the film whatsoever. Total false advertising.I would say if it is on Netflix or cable and you don't have to spend money watching this and you feel compelled, go for it, but set your expectations really low. I wouldn't even say it was entertaining. So many other better movies to watch. Happy Death Day and Truth or Dare were much better as far as new Blum House films. Of course, Get Out. Blum House is kind of hit or miss. Do yourself a favor and miss this one.",The First Purge
108,lucasnochez,Film Review: The First Purge/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,30 October 2018,"""Think of all the good the purge does.""In 2013, the world was introduced to a small little independent horror film called The Purge. The basis of the film revolves around the idea that, for a twelve hour period, one day out of the year in the United States, citizens, residents and all Americans are able to do whatever it is that they like, without any punishment or laws, including and not limited to; violence, vandalism, theft, rape and of course murder. While the first purge film in the series was revolutionary and kick started a franchise that is now in its fourth entry, the first film unfortunately limited itself to being, quite simply, a thrasher home invasion film with the world of the purge harrowingly surrounding it; the potential for the series was behemoth. Thankfully, the film gained steam and momentum, and more films followed, with the original director and writers on board. With the second entry, the world of the purge was explored to the streets of Los Angeles, where motives of revenge and redemption were explored and showed how regular people handled the deadliest night in America. In The Purge: Election Year, the purge got more political (not that it never was), especially since the looming potential of a somewhat clueless President was on the verge of being elected (he didn't actually win, did he?).Politics and tongue-in-cheek social/economically charge commentary is something that the purge series isn't stranger to, especially within the last two entires in the series. But like any good planned B-Movie film series, the fourth entry in the series is also, technically speaking, the first movie in the series, a prequel. The First Purge is an interesting cinematic approach in terms of shock value, only because, the build up of whether the purge is a successful experiment is answered within minutes of the first film, so what is the point of this film?Writer and original director of the first three entries, James DeMonaco, who's love child is basically this series, decides to use the first purge film to show the divide between people and their thoughts on this ""experiment"". Sanctioned by the New Founding Fathers of America, the newest political party, who is coincidentally backed any the NRA (National Rifle Association), and developed by scientist Dr.Updale (Marisa Tomei), ""the experiment"" (the initial name for the purge) was only taking place on Staten Island, one of America's lowest income and poorly populated cities (coincidence). If you stay on the island, you get paid $5,000. If you participate in the experiment, you get monetary compensation; if you kill someone, well then you get compensated generously. These are all incentives for the residents of Staten Island.While we quickly become familiar with the main inhabitants of Staten Island, we are also introduced to all the family drama happening on the island as well, for instance, the main protestor and the purge's biggest rival is the educated and powerfully independent Nya (Lex Scott Davis), whose ex boyfriend Dimitri (Y'lan Noel) is Staten Island biggest gangster, and who's brother Isaiah (Jovian Wade) is secretly joining in the purge's festivities, to get back at a local crack addict for nearly cutting open is throat. While the streets belong to Dimitri, his heart still belongs to Nya, despite their past and current relationship woes.As the experiment commences, we quickly see that many of the people involved and brave enough to withstand staying, spend most of their time praying, socializing or partying on the island. With the exception of the freaky looking crack head Skeletor (Rotimi Paul), who fashioned himself his own Freddy Kruger inspired claws made out of needles, Staten Island and its residents aren't really purging as expected, unless you consider trap-music inspired street festivals as purging. So, like any good social/political experiment gone wrong in the United States, the government intervenes and sends out their own ""citizens"", ex-mercenaries to kill and rid of low-income residents on Staten Island and cleanse the American genome. You can imagine, Dimitri, the only resident on Staten Island who profits from other people's misery, isn't happy when the government decides to take out his clientele, so, like any good business owner, who goes out himself to rid of his corporate competition.There are many things wrong with the First Purge including the film's main antagonist and protagonists. Perhaps thats the point, I mean, even the woman who developed the purge has her own scene of redmeption, but then again, how is a person redeemed of concieving such a diabolical experiment, especially when she sells it to the most corrupt clients in the world, the American government? Dimitri is hailed as the films main hero by the times the credits roll, but no matter how many ""baddies"" are killed by his hands, and no matter how many friends he saves, Dimitri is basically the purge 364 days in the year, so making him a hero for a day is less than convincing.While The First Purge had the potential to be one of the stronger films in the series, it is by far one of the weakest and easily the most B-Movie of them all. While the residents of Staten Island truly inherit a mess of a political system and all its whacky ideas, The First Purge film, inherits a very poorly constructed and thought-out prequel foundation that suffers from surface level thought, relevance and most of all, excitement. While much of the film is lathered Uber-violence, blood and extreme gore, The First Purge is easily the most violent and has the least amount to say.While the film has many redeeming qualities, including Dimitri, a certified bad-ass and Rambo inspired anti-hero, as well as some very harrowing ideas and thoughts that are revealed with regards to the current status of civil divide and racist plaguing America as this review is written, it is clear that director Gerard McMurray wanted to make a purge film that pushed the idea of ""black power"" into the purge series. Not only does it work effortlessly, but the film also succeeds at showing just how not far off what we see on screen is happening in real life.The First Purge is an excruciating film experience; not because what is seen on screen at the multiplexes, but whats seen on screen in our own homes on news channels each and every day.",The First Purge
109,skullhead739,Why all the 1s?,5,4 March 2020,"Not sure if people are getting really high before watching this but its definitely not a 1, it's average and I'll tell you why.Acting:
Not that bad, incredibly cringy with the scarred psycho character and with all the ""hood talk"" but other than that it was decent.Cinematography:
Great set design and shots as always in these purge movies, they're really creative.Story:
Here's where it gets bad. The story is too boring and mundane, its just about a brother, sister and a gang member surviving ""the purge"". With little to no characterization and feeling into the characters. It feels like they will get through any situation and even if they dont why would we care. The previous purges where emmensly more creative and enduring.Summary:
All up people should actually leave proper reviews and stop smoking the devil's lettuce. This is by no means a 1, trust me I've seen some bad 1 star movies. This is a 5, maybe a 6 on a good day. Watch it if you love murderous movies but otherwise I would stay away.",The First Purge

Lets put it this way, the gangsters are all upright moral good guys who fight like ninjas with swords against organized mercs with bazookas, and win easily. They turn into the heroes of the town by the end. And oh, literally, all white people in this movie are evil without exception. The soundtrack is all rap so if thats not your thing, take an aspirin before you watch. Everything that happens is ridiculous and not in the funny way. In fact, there are no funny scenes nor any scary ones in this movie. Too bad this made money because it makes the human race look really silly.",The First Purge

113,justinwfirestone,Prescient as Idiocracy?,7,8 July 2018,"The First Purge lies somewhere between The Purge (The first Purge movie) and Idiocracy. The beauty of the idea of a purge is that the government is the product of its citizens' cognitive dissonance. That is to say: on one hand the government is so inept that it could never get anything right; and on the other hand the government is controlled by a small number of evil, rich, and extremely effective white people who know how to get stuff done pronto.Also, there's that nagging, crunched-up piece of yarn pulling somewhere at the base of your thyroid or pituitary gland which whispers: ""There are Things They don't want Us to Know."" Surely, it would be instant insanity if one person knew everything the government ever did or was planning, so let's settle for a slice of knowledge. The idea of the purge was classist and racist and it would have failed except for a little white triggering.The first purge is (will be?) held on Staten Island, although Wichita could have been interesting, or even a smaller town like Mill Valley, California. Staten Island was chosen first based on its perceived proclivity for maximum self-purge, with the not-so-subtle suggestion that it's OK for poor black people to kill each other if they want to, with an official stamp of government approval for twelve hours once per year. No one seems interested in using the chance to download a bunch of Westworld torrents.It's not too dire, though. The worst person on the island is Skeletor (no, not that Skeletor). The Skeletor of Staten Island has no secret castle, no Havoc Staff to wave around. Instead, the Skeletor of Staten Island needs to smoke crack or he gets angry, so angry he wants to purge, usually with a knife.Every baddie has a hero, and Staten Island's hero is a good-hearted drug lord who also happens to have the physical skills of Black Panther, able to take out entire squads of professional mercenaries single-handedly. It goes without saying that violence is romanticized and only better violence is better.With stark visuals of KKK hoods and Nazi Death Troops, The First Purge does not feel like science-fiction, but more like a satire. We can only hope the government has plans for a more civilized purge.",The First Purge

But the high-tech drones and the glowing eyes do not fit into the franchise. The franchise has never been known to be profound, but the feeling that I especially had in the first film of anxiety that ordinary people will kill because they can, I do not have in this film at all.

121,richarddillomes,"Okay on it's own, bland compared to the first three installments.",6,22 March 2020,"'The First Purge' is the fourth installment of the Purge franchise, and is a prequel which takes us back all the way to when the first purging happened: as an experiment staged in Staten Island which served as a precursor to what is now known as an annual event. People were asked to participate in exchange for money if and when they survive the 12 hour experiment, where any form of killing becomes legal. The movie tells us that purging is anti-poor and that people in power will use whatever means possible in order to either exploit them and make more money or eliminate them if they are determined as useless and is contributing to the depletion of valuable resources. So the question is, if it was you, would you have stayed for the money or flee to safety?The movie in a way is still a testament to the current political climate, where in order for one party to succeed the other must suffer. No ifs, ands or butts. You're either for or against an idea, but the concept of being critical but still in support of the administration is considered alien and unfathomable. Unfortunately this is a little lost in the storytelling which focused heavily on the background of the characters involved, making the 98 minute affair a little bland compared to its predecessors. Maybe explaining how it all started lessened the fear factor because we know the motivation and therefore can process why what's happening is happening. Not knowing what's going on is half of what scares us, the other is finding out and not being able to do anything about it.Aside from this, there is a Purge TV series released the same year, and a fifth and apparently the final movie set for next year. While the idea seems saturated, there are still more stories to be told and I wouldn't be surprised if there's a reboot a couple of years from now. Until then all we can do is wait out the 12-hour period and hope that next year they can make The Purge great again.",The First Purge

124,cyifly-2,Great Idea - Terrible Movie.,2,31 October 2018,"To me, telling a story about how the concept of The Purge got started sounded like a great idea since I really liked the other Purge films. A few minutes into the movie, something else happened to the idea. They never really went into that part of the story. It was very much a passing moment in the movie and not the real story. Instead, we get a script that an amateur wrote. The acting was horrible because they could not save the horrible dialogue. The story was all over the place and directing/editing was just awful. The whole thing felt like a college film school project more than a Hollywood movie with a $13 million budget. It was definitely not the movie I was expecting to watch. Had I read it was going to take place in a primarily black ghetto with almost all black characters hated on by all white people, I would not have even watched. My wife walked out. I should've gone too. It didn't get better they longer it went. It kept getting more and more laughably bad. It's Extremely racist (and I've never said that in a review before). It's racist in several ways. The white politicians sectioning off a primarily black ghetto to do the first Purge should have been my first clue. The white supremacist motorcycle gangs who were waving flags, came from nowhere and mass murdered only black people was almost my breaking point. The all-white mercenary malitia who was not part of the Purge killing off any living black person in a projects tower was when I reached for the remote. All white people were evil. All the black people toted guns and were murderers, crazy or drug dealers. There was no one to root for. I didn't like a single person in the film.
I'm surprised that script could get past the editors' desk, much less be produced into a movie. Everyone associated with this schlock should be embarrassed.You have to 'go with it' with the Purge films. They are not plausible in any way. They are strictly just horror movie fun. But this was so bad, we were saying out loud, ""There is no way that could happen."" or ""Why did they do THAT. THAT makes no sense."" Over and over. Go back and watch ANY of the other films before watching this mess. They are all much better.",The First Purge

126,lorddrewsus,Could be better I guess.,4,27 September 2018,"This movie, man. It's kind of slow and weird, but I have no idea why everyone is saying it was bad. I have a low bar for movies, so I have no idea. What makes this scary, is for the last two to three decades, steps have been made by the government, to do similar stuff. Which is worse: the patriot act of the purge? You get a free get out of jail card with the purge, though. 
 The action was light most of the way through the beginning. But it's still used for plot and character building. Though predicting this film is easy, the thought these kinds of movies provoke, is far more valuable then the movie is itself sometimes. 
 Don't go rent it (is that even a thing anymore?) and expect to see something like the other two. But this one has it's merits. (SPOILER ALERT)

127,baehr_adam,Release the Beast in 2018.,10,8 July 2018,I want to first start off with saying that I'm a huge fan of the Purge series as a whole. I own and have seen all of the films with Anarchy being my personal favorite. I will now start the review. I enjoyed this prequel quite a bit. I would say it's my second favorite in the series. I don't know what is up with all of the negative reviews from critics and users alike saying it's filled with propaganda and racism. Wake Up what is this your first Purge movie?!?! The first two films had an underlying tone of it and the third went full force with the radical racism. Anyways the story is about the first Purge ever which takes place in Staten Island after the economy crashes and a new form of Government takes a hold over the democratic and republican parties and comes up with this Grand Idea. The acting is decent nothing to write home about though Y'lan Noel as Dmitri was the highlight. The action was great though a tad slower to the uptake compared to the second and third films in the series but that is understandable with the plot. The movie is what it's which is mindless B-Movie Fun and if you wanna read into it and berate it for what it insinuates then that is all you. The franchise makes money just like the Paranormal series and so many others so there is a demographic that enjoys these movies a ton. I personally can't wait for the tv series coming to USA later this year. Stay for the credits though if you do watch it and enjoy.,The First Purge
128,HorrorFanatic4Life,Should have stopped at the third one..,1,9 March 2019,"This movie was just bad, mainly because I think they just overdid it. The third being the best, they should have just stopped there. The plot was horrible in this one and seemed more racially motivated than it should have been. There wasn't much to keep you interested throughout the entire thing and almost seemed like a random addition to the rest of the films with nothing really making any sense and didn't really feed off the others or follow suit. And again, the racial direction it took almost made it entirely uncomfortable to watch. If I could give it zero stars I would..",The First Purge
129,Healing_Process,Hard to continue,4,19 October 2019,"This movie was hardly ever engaging. The ghetto/project perspective was decently interesting for awhile. Until the purge started in the movie. The movie became less about a social experiment that fans of the movie loved and turned into a weird moral superior, political propaganda film. Where the ganstas and old heads of the hood on Staten Island band up together to kill mercenaries hired by the ""Founding Fathers"" to kill poor black people to fix the economy of the american country. (How 2018)So what you have is a very washed up script that doesn't have much psychological thriller aspects to it and instead turns into a normal ""rise up"" movie with political bias and race bait themes. Probably to compete with movies like ""Get Out"".
There was even a unnecessary ""Pussy Grabbing"" scene. Which I'm guessing was a Trump reference.",The First Purge

133,rustonreviews,A tedious and unnecessary prequel.,2,22 July 2018,"Probably the most frustrating thing about The Purge franchise is, ironically, it's fantastic premise: an annual law in which all crime is legal for one bloody, chaotic night. On this night, citizens can cave to their most sadistic fantasies, for their isn't any law to restrict them of all their repressed depravities. The Purge (2013) was a decent spin on the home invasion movie, whilst its poor sequels Anarchy (2014) and Election Year (2016) took to the streets and focused on those attempting to survive the night amid the violence. This fourth instalment takes us back to the beginning, in which the Purge itself begins life as an experiment dreamt up by the shady NFFA. To be conducted on Staten Island for one night, those who volunteer to participate in the first purge are instructed to wear contact lenses, so their activity can be monitored throughout the night. Those who option not to participate are granted $5000 in compensation. What frustrates me terribly is that out of the four films built upon such a great idea, is that none of them have come close to living up to the full potential of its premise, and The First Purge is no exception. Unfortunately, this lacklustre prequel edges closer to the truly disastrous Election Year rather than navigating the franchise into a more interesting direction. Say what you will about the original film, it certainly wasn't great but at least it felt like a coherent piece of work. The First Purge knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. It knows its trash and is totally unapologetic about that fact. Despite all it's gruesome kills and nasty splatter, the film is a stunningly tedious experience that fails to engage. It's a painfully boring ride with one dimensional characters, some truly abysmal cinematography during the action sequences (especially in the third act), and a stunningly dull script. A fourth film in a franchise needs to revitalize the narrative, or else it's destined to fail. What we have here is a carbon copy of the previous two films, only this time with the gimmick of addressing it as a prequel to dress it up as something more interesting than it really is. Don't let the marketing fool you, this isn't an interesting exploration into how one of the craziest annual laws came into fruition; it's just another movie about people killing each other, simply because they can.",The First Purge

137,impendingdd,Fun as hell!,4,2 March 2020,"I found this prequel to ""The Purge"" to be one of the more entertaining films in the franchise. Growing up in The Bronx it was refreshing to see a horror movie take place in the projects of Staten Island, as opposed to the usual suburbs we see in most horror films. But don't get it twisted, this isn't ""Purge in the hood"". By that I mean it's not a parody. Its laughable, yes, and not by any means a profound film. I did, however, find it to be a smart way of showing of how the Purge came about. Other than that, check your brain at the door for an entertaining film and even creepy at times. Its a fun B-Film, don't expect anything more.",The First Purge
138,pedroquintaoo,The first time is always to forget and the same happens with the first purge,4,23 September 2018,"It's just an okay film, more of the same. From a sociological perspective, it's a huge mistake, portrays all poor people or black people as drug dealers and shows the American stereotype that all Russians are evil and dangerous. Also has some plot holes that do not make sense in the story, exaggerates in the action and fails to create suspense.
The producers must feel lazy to express their creativity, because they could produce good stories around the premise that all crime is legal for 24 hours and that would originate curious stories with different concepts. For example:An emotional and psychological horror film that would show two 13-year-old and 10-year-old brothers running away from their home during the purge night, they wanted to watch what happens in the streets with their own eyes. Meanwhile their innocence would be destroyed, their family would try to find them and then they would die in front of the brothers, the kids would have to survive together until the end of that night and deal with the weight of their consequences.Another example would be a film that shows a naive and poor teenager who has seen her nude pictures getting shared on the internet, she also was sexually abused by a boy and bulied by rich teenagers. all guilty went unpunished by the judicial system. So she decides to use the night of the purge to do justice by her own hands! The movie would make us doubt if she would really be able to complete her revenge and question us about who are the real monsters. It would briefly resemble 13 Reasons Why, Hostel and Hard Candy.Another idea for a another film would introduce a group of 5 digital influencers (1 of them was black and one was gay or trans) who decided to take a roadtrip through of the night to document everything on video and to get views on their pages. But the situation would become drastic as they begin to be chased by a group of neo-Nazis willing to purge the people they consider impure to their country. Would have a vibe of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Joy Ride and Mad Max due to vehicle chases. The ending would be bitter, one of the protagonists would betray his friends just to get a video that would give him a lot of views, but would also end up dead. A lousy end, but great to think about the limits (or the lack of them) of the human being has in search of fame and recognition.Finally, one last example would show a family of European tourists who had their flight canceled due to a tornado in the USA, they are forced to spend the night of the purge in the USA. The family would try to survive against the purge maniacs and the catastrophe. There would be epic action sequences and the feel of the characters being in constant danger! They could not take a shelter in buildings because they would be full of killers, as on the other hand, the streets would be dangerous because of the natural disaster.I think some producers have ideas like mine, but they prefer to give us repetitive and two-dimensional stories.Rating: 5/10

From the opening credits to the ending, I was at the edge of my seat and couldn't believe I was watching a movie that had so much depth and soul. The First Purge is an amazing film which depicts a realistic view in some circles of society today. I was deeply moved and had to go buy three more tickets for the next screening. I am going to watch this movie again and again until the IMDB rating gets to at least the 13 Days 4.5. Go see this movie and rate it high, you won't be disappointed.",The First Purge
142,damorejj,"Propaganda, plot holes, pitiful.",1,15 July 2018,"This movie was so bad, it made the first Purge movie seem like Schindlers List. Anyone who's white in this movie is evil, and the hero of the movie is a drug dealer who champions saving his neighborhood at the end when he's actually destroying it with his profession. 
Staten Island is portrayed in the film as a black community centered by an apartment complex called Park Hill, when in reality Staten Island is predominantly white middle class. This part of the island isn't shown or mentioned in the film. Why this is important is not because of race, but because we find out the new political party known as the NFFA has hired ex military to swoop in during the experiment and wipe out all the black lower class people. First, this movie assumes only blacks are lower class, which is far from the truth. Second, if this sick plan were to actually be put in place in the real world, Staten Island wouldn't be the place to do this as previously mentioned, the majority is white middle class on the island. The movie mentions the NRA as now backing the NFFA which is absolutely ridiculous and I'll be surprised if the NRA doesn't sue the makers or this film. The NRA is a foundation that promotes the second amendment for protection from tyranny and personal protection. Not for murder. As the NRRA seems to be obsessed with in this film as the suits from the party are dissapointed with the initial low body count. 
This movie is simply made to divide people and cause more racism at a time when we need to come together. Not only does it send a horrible message, the story itself was riddled with plot holes and horrible acting. Zero stars.",The First Purge

144,derangedxzombie,The First Purge reveals itself as a ridiculous race film,1,19 October 2018,"What started off with promise and a possibly interesting insight into how ""The Purge"" begun and came to be law, soon descends into a bland and unoriginal racial stylized movie.
Where the enemy are white people in power and the victim not the impoverished but anyone not white, who are saved from the kkk and neo nazi's by gangsters..no that's not a joke unfortunately. A quick way to send a franchise to the grave, many avenues could've been taken and before the ridiculous plot is revealed for what it is, it has credibility. You see scores of people not actually wanting to kill or fight but instead partying and enjoying freedom, aside from a few criminals and violent acts. You see scores that can be settled by different characters done wrong and their story arcs (that are connected mostly) or other characters that make brief appearances giving reason for their want to purge. You see what appear to be various gangs, even including a white supremacy gang, and then the notion there's mercenaries in the mix. All this gives room to various sub plots that anyone can relate to if they were in such a situation.But before you know it a church that happened to be filled with only people of ethnic origins, gets attacked by clansman and suddenly everyone is in on a big plot to just have ethnic people killed, yes that escalated quickly. Another part showed someone dressed as a nazi gestapo, or a gimp, flanked by two nazi soldiers, it's at this point I couldn't watch anymore of the silly plot and victimization wet dream, ignoring the stories of or fact staton island does have different nationalities living there. It makes out people of ethnic background to be so badly victimized that they need to be saved by one muscular gang leader. The plot is very distasteful and feels like a mockery of the realistic tribulations ethnic people do actually face in America particularly. But to use this as a large plot revelation or maybe for shock value completely ruins the basis of the purge franchise and what people could enjoy it as from the previous movies. Save your money for better less insulting movies.",The First Purge
145,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Not as good as the others,5,20 October 2018,"The First Purge is a prequel to the franchise showing us how the annual event started. Usually whenever these films get political they are never as clever as they think they are. The First Purge is no exception as it repeats the same old political satirical style we've already seen in the previous films and it's even goofier. With lines like ""pussy grabber"" it's clearly aimed at today's Trump era and it's just played for cheap laughs.The set-up is slow and meaningless because we already know what will happen and they spend a good twenty minutes building up the story and trying to create tension. The main villain is just a political figure in a suit who gives out stupid speeches about cleaning up society and we've seen it plenty of times before.We never feel a connection to these one dimensional characters as a lot of them are annoying clichéd stereotypes. There are some okay scenes that look good and it's unpredictable sometimes in the way it just kills off characters. But in the end it's just repeats the things from the previous films in a way where it feels tedious. Beware because there is a TV spin-off coming soon.",The First Purge
146,Larsii90,It was allright,6,30 January 2021,"Definitely had some good parts, but overall the movie had soooo much potential, and it felt like a very random and uneccesary sequel. Like a Purge 4 if there were several in the franchise",The First Purge

148,dunnypop,Pretty much the same as the other Purge films,5,30 July 2018,"I'm a fan of the Purge films or perhaps the concept of the films. The first Purge film was a home invasion movie, Purge Anarchy was more like Mad Max/Action, and Purge Election Year was more of the same. Each Purge film brings in some interesting subtext on some extreme views of how America has become a festering breeding ground for violence. Each film starts off roughly the same. There's an interesting backstory, then the purge begins and then all subtext / ideas / ideology disappears and is surrounded by violence and action.I still like these films as they're entertaining but there is a lot to be desired. The First Purge takes you into the countries current divide and how an uprising of a new governmental party has rose from the countries divide of the Republicans / Democrats (this was literally told in a montage in the first minute). From there, there was a participatory government experiment on having the purge. The film felt more like the disenfranchised black experience of the purge and explored what Purge Anarchy discussed. The movie is entertaining but a bit ridiculous towards the end. There's a Purge TV show which seems like the right direction for the franchise.",The First Purge

150,amufan,The original Purge was such Unique thriller....how did they let it become so bad...,2,9 July 2018,"Yes the original movie had a small political point of view but it was not the main plot line, it was the question of the purge itself, it actually made you think about what iff.... Also the original had no racial bias, it took place in a wealthy neighbor hood with multiple races and in fact the white family and black homeless man worked together to fend off the interracial mix of wealthy homeowners. It did a great job of not letting those issues that seem to plague so many movies and focus on its task, presenting a new and unique plot line that was suspenseful and very entertaining. 
The 2nd purge attempted to expand beyond one family in one neighborhood and begin to touch the moral question and what the real purpose of the concept of the purge was, to try and eliminate the lower class and anyone that were deemed a leech on society, again doing an excellent job. It did not make it a race issue, because contrary to what many politicians will tell you is there are poor people across all races, it is NOT just a black issue....you see poverty is colored blind! The third movie did its best to keep it non racial, but in the end failed miserably. 
Now we come to this movie, I don't leave movies early, and 3/4 of the way through I thought ok there is a racial undertone but not so bad I can't ignore it. Then like the 3rd movie only to an new level, this movie turned completely, 100% about white vs black, I had to leave...

159,rolandjordaan2,The First Purge - Spoiler Free Review,1,14 September 2018,"I guess before I start this review, I should probably mention that I was not up to date on 'The Purge' franchise while viewing this; I only saw the original in parts - didn't like it - and didn't bother with the two sequels, hell this prequel I didn't even know had come out yet and the only reason I ended up seeing it, was because I had two hours to burn between seeing 'The Nun' and 'The Meg'. So up until recently, I went to bed at night knowing a few things, I was born with two hands, mayonnaise is heavier than milk and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' will undoubtedly be the worst movie that I'll see in 2018...and now I have seen 'The First Purge' and sitting there felt like somebody was slowly dissecting my brain with a butter knife and charging me money to sit there and watch it. This movie makes 'Leprechaun Back to Tha Hood' look like 'Shawshank Redemption' and if you're wondering why I chose that particular reference, it's because 'The First Purge' is a black movie - I don't even feel racist saying that, because this screenplay very well could have been written by Julius Malema...going by the assumption that he's actually able to read; I'll explain why in a second. So as the title suggests, this movie plays off before the original, and starts off a few days before the first experimental 'Purge' is scheduled to take place. Staten Island is the location chosen for this experiment and the government is offering five thousand Dollars to every resident who chooses to stay the night, with bonuses promised to those who actually go out and purge...yay. Here's this movie's view on the world: all black people are poor and underprivileged, and are suppressed by white authorities who see them all as liabilities that should simply be disposed of. That's quite literally the world in this film, every single resident of Staten Island is black and underprivileged and every single government worker is white and evil. Now usually I'd say something about the characters or acting here, but what can I possibly say? There is no character to carry this film, the closest thing it has to a lead is drug dealer/saint (even though we see him execute rival gang members throughout the film), Dmitri (Y'lan Noel), possibly the most uneven character ever written; it's like there were two writers working on this script and they never spoke two words to each other before handing it in as completed. The only other two characters I should probably mention are Nya and her little brother, Isaiah; I guess these are the two characters we're supposed to care about, but neither have enough depth or development to pull that off. There are about a million side characters, who are basically indistinguishable, they all talk the same, they all sound the same, they all act the same...to such an extent that on several occasions, when a character is killed, and they actually take a good minute or two for the characters and audience to mourn the loss...I did not have a clue who the deceased characters were supposed to be. Wow, this movie is awful. Now, I have heard from several sources that the previous two entries in this franchise were actually quite decent, with special emphasis always put on the death scenes being quite imaginative, that's what you'd expect from a movie like this...in this case: don't, it's all just characters getting stabbed and shot, with zero intensity, because you don't care whether any of the characters live or die, anyway. There's a scene with Dmitri hunting down government soldiers that goes on way too long, with the screen flashing throughout the majority, people complained about 'The Blair Witch Project' making them feel sick, well this scene might just give you a seizure. I don't even know what else to say about this movie, I feel like I'm just ranting, but, in my defence, that's exactly what this movie was doing: it's a cash grab film in a popular franchise that brings nothing new to the table, offers very little info that we weren't already familiar with and just runs through the motions, obviously struggling to fill its 1 hour and 38 minute run time. Overall, avoid this movie like the plague, rather go bash your head against a wall for 2 hours, just, whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie. As stupid as the concept of 'The Purge' is, I kinda hope that it does eventually happen so that people can punish everyone who worked on this film.",The First Purge
160,afrocut,Another try to get it right,4,4 July 2018,"It's almost the 4th of July , which means we get another Purge movie , which also means they get another attempt to get this right. And ,with no shock to any one, I am the bearer of bad news... they've failed once again . The First Purge decides to go the prequel route and has the chance of telling us all the hows and whys deep within the lore of this franchise's main gimmick, why is the purge a thing our society chose to do? Marisa Tomei gets the honor of being its creator , but all she's given is about 10 minutes of screen time , all of which is phoned in on the worst green screen you've ever seen in a big screen film . Instead we spend most of our time with a drug kingpin (our hero?) ,his ex a sister (against the purge) , her brother (sick of the poor life) who wants to kill - a drug addict lunatic (who really likes the purge so much he named it ) . None of these characters can bring the weight or emotion that franchises own Frank Grillo brings to the screen in previous titles . But that doesn't stop them from trying to make a hero out of a bad guy . One scene shows the drug dealers arsenal with a speech that goes something like this ""they loaded the streets with guns hoping we would kill each other with them and now we will kill them with them "" . Remember, this is a drug dealer who earlier in the film beats up a ""co-worker?"" Because he doesn't follow his orders and later blows his brains out . In the end hes held up as the hero of the neighborhood after he kills an army of white stereotypes dressed in hateful stereotypical masks. Its terrible and insulting .Theres so many great social ideas to play with here and personally think it should have been about a poor neighborhood banning together against the invading forces and changing the drug dealers views. The heroes should be the good hard working citizens and not the rich criminal, it just goes to show the writer and director were aiming low for a cash grab . All of this makes it sink past mediocre , but it stops short of terrible by its flowing plot , quick editing and visuals. some of which are really interesting and thought provoking. It's just to bad the script isnt .

Its poisonous cocktail of B-Movie sensibilities and enormously contrived narrative, blend like out-of-date soya milk and cold coffee to produce a lumpen misshapen cliche-riddled pile of old bollocks.To add insult to injury, the whole sorry episode plays out like an ill-informed simplistic brain-washed sixth form school project done on behalf of their class tutor, who just so happens to be a fully paid-up member of the Democratic Party of the United States of America.Rabid Democratic political bias dominating the narrative of a Hollywood motion picture? Whatever next?!!Now, whatever your political persuasion may be, being rattled by this film's relentless and shameless ideological political jackhammer for 98 minutes, is not an experience I would recommend in any sort of a hurry.To summarise: White men are all evil Republicans intent upon suppressing ethnic minorities and installing some kind of totalitarian fascist super state upon us all. And everyone else - serial killers and drug-dealing gang bosses included - are simply victims of an unjust society, and just fine.In these times of such fractious divisions in society, more than ever the arts have a real part to play in providing honesty. How good would it be if mainstream films like this made an effort to heal and encourage constructive dialogue between politically-divided people?Unfortunately, sensationalist offerings such as The First Purge are evidently completely disinterested in offering any sort of olive branch of reconciliation, and do nothing but titillate and segregate the 'them and us' still further.No matter what positives Gerard McMurray's agenda-driven nonsense occasionally throws up - and there are admittedly a few ideas and set pieces strewn about the place which stick in the memory - The First Purge, on balance, is nothing more than poorly made propaganda-laced self-congratulatory virtuous twaddle that succeeds only in dragging an already patchy franchise kicking and screaming through the cinematic gutter.Insulting drivel.",The First Purge

It's not as bad as many of the reviewers on here would have you believe but it's certainly not above average quality. I could see this kind of movie being tricky to maintain the balance between having a hero or villain to cheer for or against as they try to create a regular bodycount. But it makes sense from other angles, as such an event would end up being complete chaos with nobody to trust, gangs would establish turf, there would be racial tension and many folks would enact their rage on various groups that they want to blame for the problems in their lives. There should be an evolution from the first year where they wipe out many of the easy/stupid targets and get wiser every year. There's always an influx of stupid people but eventually you'd likely have a growing number of people avoiding the chaos or smarter killers finding more efficient ways to make cash.

The First Purge is just too obvious and dumb. To have militias dressed up as Klan members and Nazis is just almost bordering on parody. There were mixed social messages . For example , a drug dealer , who destroys his community and purges his competition , becomes the hero? Yes the original movie had a small political point of view but it was not the main plot line, it was the question of the purge itself, it actually made you think about what iff.... Also the original had no racial bias, it took place in a wealthy neighbor hood with multiple races and in fact the white family and black homeless man worked together to fend off the interracial mix of wealthy homeowners.Gave it two stars just for the sake of the previous films which were rather good and appealing",The First Purge

186,snakes3992,A good prequel,8,18 October 2018,"It explains very well on how the Purge works, as a prequel it seems to have interesting details how it works. I like the characters, the blood leader Dmitri is a good hero in this movie, he cares about his sister and brother making sure they pick the choices, and protect, I also like the fact he's a badass. The sister and brother Nya and Isaiah are a good team, always try to protect themselves, and be prepared for the Purge. Skeletor is a creepy drug addict, his behavior does gives me goosebumps, you can easily tell he's serious, and that he's ready for this to start. The movie has some good pacing and some creepy suspense. The action is intense as well. My only problem with this movie is that the acting is a little wooden, but overall a good movie.",The First Purge
187,RUaMovieFreak2,Why the hate peeps?,7,20 November 2020,"6.7/8 ...... It seems to me that many people look for a reason to bash a movie based on race, religion, politics, etc. If you can watch this with the understanding that it's just a movie without an agenda, I think you'll enjoy it. The casting was great and the three main characters (which I've never seen before) did a phenomenal job in their roles. I look forward to seeing each of them as their careers go forward. And I cannot forget to give credit to the evil Skeletor character. He gave me the creeps within the first 10 seconds he appeared. Well done!!!! Though many reviews on here see this movie as being racially oppressive or biased. I saw it as Good vs. Evil. And I found it better than many prequels to other movies. Thank you for reading my review. I am a MovieFreak!

And this movie has none. Acting is as bad as it can get. Why a fine actress like Tomei accepted this film, I don't know. Screenplay is unimaginative and hollow throughout. Humor pops up unceremoniously in the most unexpected moments and is irritating. Shooting and stabbing are somewhat satisfying. Thankfully, the editor realized he had crap on his hands and dutifully cut most scenes to size to make the predictable plot move along quickly. This movie evokes black+white racial tensions in its narrative where blacks are portrayed as victims-even murderers and gangsters-and whites as nasty predators, like Nazis. Some people are not gonna like it, others are gonna love it. I don't care. I just wanted to see a good movie, which I didn't. I was seriously considering switching to some other content on Netflix, but last act of the movie turned out to be somewhat tighter in pace and content than the rest and therefore, I decided to stick right till the end.

And I resolved to go to much less movies and be more discerning about the movies I go to. So I'm grateful I will stop seeing these random garbage movies and save some money.

Maybe it's because I grew up poor.Who is going to have the most power in this setting? It's the FIRST Purge. No one knows what to expect. No one seriously prepares. Who are the most likely people to take each other out during a 12 hour period of facked-up-overly-encouraged crime? The big-time (admittedly definitely TOO BLACK) kingpin types. Drug dealers are usually black because drug addicts are usually white. Its just the way it is. White people love heroin.And who would be most likely to accept the job to go escalate this extremely political, racial situation? Neo-nazis and the KKK.This isn't an accurate depiction of either black or white people. The only people who are going to participate in this FIRST of its kind 'experiment' are people who are already a bit desensitized to violence.There were very few 'random' purges - and the only one I can think of at this moment was an old white lady watching someone (her husband?) burn to death.

Apparently, nearly all impoverished black Americans are willing to resort to extreme crime to solve their money issues, not only that, but there are no poor white people in the Staten Island community. This film not only plays far too much into the hands of stereotypes, it's also badly written, badly executed-and with the exception of a few cast members-really badly acted.

This movie is a return to form for the franchise - I did enjoy it quite a bit though not as much as the first two. This one has a new director and it definitely shows as this movie has a very different tone to it.I really liked Y'lan Noel in this movie, he is a total badass and I definitely want to see more of him. In fact, I'd say the acting overall is improved in this installment - I liked much of the supporting cast, Lex Scott Davis and Marisa Tomei in particular. I also dug the soundtrack, even though it felt like someone going through their Spotify playlist with a different song playing in back-to-back scenes. The action in this movie is also very thrilling and as the movie progressed I was definitely engaged and having a good time.However, I noticed there was a bit too much violence in this movie compared to the others. Usually I don't mind that sort of thing but at one point it felt like someone was getting stabbed every other scene. There's also a notable difference in the delivery of it's social commentary and political message compared to the the other movies. This one is a bit heavy handed and definitely hits you over the head with it. Also, the main character, while fun to watch as an action star, isn't necessarily a person you want to root for in this movie.Overall, The First Purge is another interesting and fun action thriller with a slightly different approach that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.",The First Purge

Bad writing.,3,26 September 2018,"I hate movies like this where they cannot think of any way to draw out the movie's conflict other than making most of the characters out to be complete idiots.""Isaiah"" has two easy chances to kill the early antagonist, ""Skeletor"", but he fails to both times, even when ""Skeletor"" is in the process of slitting his sister's throat. Then they clearly deleted a scene later that resolved Skeletor's story. Then Isaiah develops a seriously sadistic killer instinct all of a sudden 3/4 of the way through the movie after the ""Skeletor"" character is simply forgotten on the cutting room floor. They also deleted the scene where he got killed, but decided to include the one that showed him randomly dead on the floor at the end. Nice work team.A few pros. I like the concept of showing how the idea of the purge took place at first as a social experiment on an island where people were lured by money to participate.I like the concept that the government had a backup plan if the purge did not go the way they wanted. And that they used the tracking devices they had paid people to put on to hunt down the most desperate of the population, who were most likely to accept the money for such a thing. That's some really, evil, sinister stuff. Usually my kind of movie.Engage sarcasm. I love it when they include a character who is a gang banger with a high IQ and a conscience. Who is willing to risk everything for the lives of strangers. I also like movies where the Pope is a mob boss.I also love in shootout situations when one side that is being seiged all start yelling ""I'm out of ammo!!!"" loud enough for the enemy to hear.Disengage sarcasm.These movies were honestly never really that great. But the concept nearly stood on it's own. This one is a huge fail. Mostly on the writers part. I don't even really care about the fact that it is essentially blacks vs whites. I'm fine with that. What annoys me is how stupid everyone seems to be except the black gang boss who is laughably named ""Dmitri"".The only reason I gave this three stars is because, as an amateur filmmaker, I have to appreciate the way some of the fight scenes were shot. The cinematography is actually pretty legit.If you watch this, prepare to have your intelligence insulted.

Very disappointing.I'm a political moderate, but the political messaging was really over the top. It was kind of like watching a hard left version of Hannity, and just as pointless. And it kept going on. Repeatedly. Over and over again. Many times. I think you get the point.The villains were extremely two dimensional and completely uninteresting. What little writing talent was devoted to the protagonists, and this was a rare good point about the movie. There's some complexity there, with people you can root for. I liked them.It was fairly suspenseful, but there were too many coincidental ""just in time"" saves for no good reason. This seemed to be just lazy writing.

The Purge franchise introduces us to a USA in the near-future, where for one day a year there is no law and rather inevitably the citizens indulge in an orgy of mayhem.
Now this film has a different feel and reveals the motivation of the Purge - the annihilation of non-whites by a nationalist right-wing and obviously white government called the New Founding Fathers of America.
Really? The makers of this film obviously have a political agenda that can be summed up as whites: bad, black/hispanic/asians good.
For God's sake we even have robed KKK killers showing up.

236,torndownunit-507-429487,A Mess,2,11 July 2018,"The movies in the Purge series are far from being art, but they have followed a formula, have been semi-consistent, and have been fun in a thriller/horror kind of way. This one is just a complete mess though. They seemed be be torn between the old formula, or making an over the top action movie. Some of the action sequences, mainly fight scenes, would be right up there with some of the most over the top cheesy 90's action movies. That could be maybe overlooked, but the characters have seem to have borderline super powers when it comes to the ridiculous fight scenes. In a light-hearted action movie, this can be fun, but it just makes no sense in this film. All the stuff that was campy in the previous films is just taken to full on stupidity territory in this one. Combined with the awful pacing, it makes a 90 minute film feel like it's 3 hours long. And the oddest part, due to the very weak plot the Purge part of the film actually seemed like the worst part. You would think a Purge origin story would be hard to mess up too badly, but they managed to. I was looking for some mindless fun on cheap night at the movies, but it was just awful on pretty much every level.",The First Purge

The other Purge movies had political and social commentaries without being too overly blatant. The First Purge is just too obvious and dumb. To have militias dressed up as Klan members and Nazis is just almost bordering on parody. There were mixed social messages . For example , a drug dealer , who destroys his community and purges his competition , becomes the hero?  There were a few interesting scenes where participants were being psychologically evaluated. The action sequences were well shot. I actually cared about the lead female character who actually wanted to do the right thing. Unfortunately though, it wasn't enough for me. The Purge Anarchy is still my favorite one.",The First Purge

I'm sure I've watched three of these films already and in these it's clearly explained the story so this Doesn't need it, it starts as an experiment with clear intentions. I enjoyed the actors performances as they rolled through this night of chaos. It's as always fixed on a line-up of, I found likeable characters with a standard story for a bit of background character building (nothing Oscar worthy) but enjoyable!What I can't understand is the reviews being negative all the time on here. If you've gone out your way to see the movie then surely you've at least seen a previous one. In no way is this a boring or dull film it is what it is. I personally don't believe you can give all these movies a 1 I've only ever watched a 100 films out of thousands I'd give lower than a 2. It's a new fresh look by taking us back to the first purge with some good acting and some clever little ideas. If people are giving 1,s they should think about stopping in and reading a book instead. If your going to watch a film called meg for instance don't right a review saying it's unrealistic because it's got a 70ft shark in, of course it's unrealistic...!I love films always have and try anything if it doesn't grab me in 30 mins then I'll turn it off. I wouldn't go and watch another 3 of the same films it's clearly not for you... but if you like this sort of film give it a go I'd seriously give it a 5-6 and it really didn't loose any points on the acting or even directing it was what I expected and a tiny bit more...!",The First Purge
240,emeziereal,A once watchable franchise murdered on the table of hollywood politics,1,21 September 2018,"The concept of the purge thrilled me when i first encountered it.. loved the concept, the mental twist.

The delivery of the whole movie unbelievably lax.. thank goodness i didnt put anything aside to watch it. Hollywood needs to seriously check itself",The First Purge
241,marksc123,White guilt complex,1,30 October 2018,"If you suffer with white guilt compex or see drug dealers as good guys then you will really enjoy this movie. However, if you do not have such mental health issues or warped ideas of what a good guy is then you won't be too impressed.I was tempted to give the movie a generous 4 rating because I have really enjoyed the purge series and wanted it to be better but I just can't justify it. This is one of the first movies in history that you could argue is racist against white people, and for that reason it's worth watching as the first example of such a film.This movie portrays all white people as bad guys, and most black people - even the criminal black people as the good guys. I found myself sitting there feeling offended which is the kind of thing that we should really be moving away from.The standard of acting in this film is much worse than any of the others, we've gone from having the odd well known actor to an almost fully unknown cast who struggled to make up for the weak story and dialogue.I would say that this has killed the franchise when it had the chance to really set the foundation that the original movies were built on. Here we have a drug dealer main character who all of a sudden has better morals than the entire white race and has more fighting skills than Chuck Norris. Completely unbelievable and unrelatable character and he is supposed to be the hero of the story.The only likeable characters are the brother and sister pairing who are relatively decent although she is the ex-partner of a drug dealer and he is a current street corner drug dealer.If you've never watched any of the others then avoid this movie like the plague. If you have seen all of the others then it's worth watching to complete the set. I've given it a 3 instead of a 1 simply because it shows us how the purge started, regardless of how much better it could have been it still adds substance to the series and although the main character has no reasonable explanation for why he is such a talented martial artist/navy seal standard shooter the fight scenes are well done.I'm hoping the upcoming tv series is not in keeping with this latest movie.",The First Purge

Black vs White. KKK looking killers. Hell, there's even Nazi looking gear. Grabbing chics by the p*ssy. Just flat out awful. Even free with MoviePass it was almost worthy of walking out.",The First Purge
245,Random3,The purge in the movie is as much of a failure as the movie itself.,3,5 October 2018,"Worst one of the four, easily. I didn't like the first or third films, the second was semi-decent because it remembered that movies are supposed to be fun, but this one was the worst.The only good thing here is there was a reasonably well done fight scene that was in one shot. Well actually two shots, because they tried to hide a camera cut right before they swap the actor out for a stunt guy to throw him down some stairs.So the setup for the film is the same as the others, but confined to a single island. They are doing a trial run of the purge, whereby any and all crime is legal for 12 hours. People who live on the island are paid $5000 to stay during the purge, and are given incentive to go out and commit acts of violence. This trial run doesn't work for them, because the only person who purges is a man who calls himself ""Skeletor"".We are then told that the island was chosen because the population is entirely poor people. Because this film is all about subtlety, the entire population of this town is also black. It turns out the whole idea of implementing the purge was to reduce the population of poor (black) people because reasons. So because they haven't started killing each other yet (apart from our friend Skeletor) the government decide to send in help from the outside. So they send in two groups of people who are known for killing black people: the police, and the KKK.So now we have the police force and the KKK going around this island murdering black people. All of the Purge movies have been ""political"" to a degree, and have been trying to provide some level of social commentary (even if all attempts at this have been completely retarded) but this film takes it a step further by adding race into the mix. Now we have white people killing black people, and we are supposed to feel sad and/or outraged. Then the black people rise up and cathartically kill the evil white man, and we are supposed to feel satisfaction and happiness. What I actually felt was more that my head was starting to go numb from having ""THIS IS WHERE AMERICA IS HEADED"" pummelled into my face for 90 minutes.So the purge in the movie fails absolutely. Only like two or three people actually commit acts of violence outside of the law. Remember our friend Skeletor? Despite being a comically overacted and unhinged psychopath, he turns up at the end to save the day. At the end of the film however, we are told ""The purge has been a great success! We will be doing them again over the whole country!""The purge in the movie is as much of a failure as the movie itself. And, like the entire concept of ""purging"", once you stop to think about it for five seconds, the movie doesn't work.",The First Purge

Only watched the first movie, and I couldn't even finish it, it was so bland and predictable and plain bad. But I saw the trailer for The First Purge and somehow decided that it might be a decent horror/drama, with some sociopolitical elements. The trailer turned out to be about much better than the movie.. 
There is no coherent plot, the acting is wooden and stereotypical, and like in all cheap trash horror movies out there, there is no common sense or logic. I don't want to focus on the negatives, as there are so many of them.
It could have been good. They just needed to add a few subplots, some logic and development and to leave the gore and horror, but make it a bit more realistic and believable, so that the idea of class struggle and the politicians against the people is plausible. 
Instead it looks like a parody, and that is before the Dmitri starts acting like a black Rambo and the white guys are all bad and wearing Nazi uniforms. The last 20 mins of the movie me and my friends, and the majority of the movie theatre couldn't hold in the laughter, that's how ridiculous was everything.

Then on top of it all, they make the rich drug dealer kingpin and his gang out to be the heroes of the whole story who saves the black community. Yeah, great message.

265,PennywiseFA,Just turn your brain off,6,20 September 2018,"Though it's a huge step down from all the previous Purge films, some scenes were rather enjoyable. I enjoyed a lot of the Skeletor-scenes, he was a convincing angry maniac and practically the only ""real"" purger in the movie, besides perhaps the masked old ladies and some of the random encounters on the street.I think the two mains did a good job with the script they were given, which frankly was shoddy at best. I think Y'lan Noel is one actor we'll be hearing more of.As a bird's eye perspective on today's political climate, this film didn't function too well. There were some cheap shots at feigned politics and they made it look too easy to get away with murder, literally. Some jokes were just bland.The biggest problem I had was with the end. A drug dealer doing a 180, first killing his competition to end up saving pretty much his entire neighborhood, and being received as a modern day Escobar over a 12-hour timespan? Nah. ""What do we do now?"" ""We fight,"" said the drugdealer, like a watered down Robin Hood.

There was no way he would have survived the confrontation with the soldiers in that building.

Easy viewing on a lazy Friday night was the rationale for even bothering in the first place.The Purge was a fantastic concept upon it's initial movie launch. A genuine, original idea that was so intriguing. Unfortunately with each follow up there has been a steady deterioration.The latest installment, a prequel to the first movie, could've been a final hurrah that would've saved the overall reputation of the series. But no, they absolutely missed a very good opportunity.I'm not even going to bother listing what this movie could've been. I'll cut to the chase by describing the narrative in 4 parts:Part 1: Staten Island selected to be trial location for the first purge. Very little pretext other than a new political party coming to power amid economic downturnPart 2: Meet the protagonist(s). A drug dealer, an anti purger, anti purgers brother. All linked tenously. You won't care about any of them.Part 3: The Purge. Not much happens. Predictable plot twist (that isn't a plot twist to anyone who's not experienced a lobotomy). In short, new government plants some mercenaries to kick start the purging.Part 4: Protagonists survive. The end.And thats it. Not even in a nutshell. That is genuinely it.

Heard some negative sounds here and there. But everyone's a critic these days and that probably stops them from turning off your brain and just enjoy a movie. If you haven't seen the others than go see it! It's just good fun.",The First Purge
291,tom-james-brennan,Walked out,1,19 July 2018,"As a fan of the initial Purge movie, and given the second was tolerable, I went to see this movie expecting little, but hoping for some enjoyable explanation of how the purge came about and to see some interesting characters and battle royale style action. 
I could stomach about 30 minutes of this movie before walking out of the theatre to go see Skyscraper due to the fact that seemingly every other word was n**** and the characters were such a pastiche of poor urban communities. Please note I am ok with the use of the ""n"" word when it is either culturally or characteristically relevant to do so or done to enhance the abhorrence of dramatic circumstance (such as in Django Unchained, Hateful Eight, or Training Day).When the purge finally began at about 25 minutes in to the movie, I had no regard for any of the characters, was unimpressed with the ""skeletor psycho"" (who apparently had not been picked up by any law enforcement or civil service agency to try and help him as he's clearly psychotic), and could not figure out why or how two geriatric women were able to create explosive devices from cuddly toys and old Nokia phones. 
The contact lenses, that the participants of the purge are made to wear, glow different colours, and for some reason that I didn't, nor do I want to understand, this seemed like a good option for the NFFA - ""hey this event is happening at night, people are going to want to be stealthy, here make your eyes glow in the dark so everyone can see you hiding."" In summary, it's a waste of studio money where other films which have good scripts and deeper characters are shelved or never made, a poor acting display from all involved, a disappointment for someone of Marissa Tomei's stature, and a really belittling portrayal of ethnic groups. Avoid this one.",The First Purge

And to defend the streets of Staten Island are like 10 drug dealers who are somehow just as well trained and equipped as US military personnel. On top of that, there's a side plot where a kid tries to kill a crackhead and can't manage to win with a gun against said crackhead who's outfitted with a pair of syringes.

They couldn't have done a worse job at making a progressive propaganda piece and unwatchable movie.

The film did what it needed to do.
It was fun to see the first Purge as it happened because in the first movie it was already established.
Dmitri had an arc, although a loose one, it was for him to make the choice. There was a direction for the movie and it was taken and showed everything that is wrong with American and European society. The drug dealer finding his humanity and fighting back was good to see.
Some of the acting was bad, but it's how it goes sometimes with films with small budgets and smaller crews.

The comic relief woman -whose character I'm sure was inspired by the 'aint nobody got time for dat' woman - was so bad at her acting, the comic relief was cringey and not funny at all.

305,proof_lady,Really good.,7,21 September 2018,"When I read the review page (after seeing the film) the first 20 reviews had only one star. What I was thinking is: Did we all watch the same movie?This is one of the best prequels I've seen. Honestly I gave it the same vote as I gave the first movie.
It shows perfectly how The Purge became what it is.
New political direction, new political party, needed to do the experiment somewhere so they chose Staten Island. It is said in the beginning that people who had enough money got out before the experiment started, so the poor people remained. Obviously. 
When the experiment did not go as planned, the New Founding Fathers arranged to bring mercenaries so that their project don't fail and that they could still be in power.
Still very logical. Because they were in black neighbourhoods the mercenaries were dressed as KKK or SS. 
NFF succeeded and remained in power (as we know because of the first Purge movie).
Everything in this movie is very logical in terms of prequel necessities.
Honestly, I do not understand why people get so insulted by everything. 
If something like Purge was to happen next year I bet this is exactly how it would play out. Or similar.The acting in the movie was okay. Nothing special.
The movie was exciting enough to make you root for the little people, even for the local gangster. 
I applaud especially the costume designers because they manage to make the masks more scary with each movie. They were amazing and brought new scare just when we thought we have already seen it all.",The First Purge

It's a little incredulous in some parts, but I found myself rooting for the characters by the end of the movie. It's gory, but not overly so. It has some funny moments and some suspenseful moments.

318,adamthomasmurphy,This is a film about power,10,3 April 2019,"This country is more divided than ever before, with conservatives dreaming of a civil war and conservative politicians like Steve King posting memes about a potential clash between right and left. This film is pure distillation of that idea in the form of institutional racism, or the Purge. Public housing in Staten Island serves as the lab rat for the Purge. The poorest are always experiments for ghoulish technocrats, but instead of means tested social programs it's the Purge, which is supposed to be start a civil war in poor neighborhoods. When that doesn't happen, the government rolls in soldiers to meet the kill quota. You can take this as a metaphor for drugs wars under Regan, or quality of life tickets by police, but the point is the same - the powerful stomp on the powerless every chance they can. I read a lot of 1-star reviews lamenting the KKK or Nazi imagery being too on the nose, and a slap in the face to white people. What people don't understand is the film isn't calling out all white people, but the power structures that tacitly allow white supremacists to force their will on to minorities - the police and politics. Every person or event has it's real life counterpart. Is it pure art? No, some of the acting is wooden and the arcs are suspect, but the point of the film isn't a character journey. The point of the film is how the powerless aren't seen as people by those in charge.",The First Purge

No one was able to be viewed as a ""good guy"" because, given the right circumstances, we all harbor terrible passions that can be let out if allowed. In this movie, they show ""how it all started"" but in doing so, they couldnt help but pander to a certain group of people who want to make all white people evil and all black and poor people victims. Even the black gangsters who routinely kill and spread evil over the world end up being shown as ""true heroes"". Why does everything have to be ""this group is good, this group is bad""? There are good and bad in ALL groups and that is what made Purge so awesome. I doubt I will watch any more of these films.

324,Dreamer_Disease,Fairytales of The First Purge,8,22 July 2018,"Once upon a time in a film far, far away, well as Randy Marsh would say, ""I Thought This Was America"" and it is, The First Purge pulls no punches and if you're not looking to be offended black, white or otherwise maybe you should skip this one, because you will be offended. One way or another this movie is meant to rub you in the wrong way but not like Lex Scott Davis as ""Nya"" and speaking of the cast I can't say I honestly knew who any of the actors or the actresses were but even without huge names, it's still so awesome.However seeing as how this is a prequel to all the other movies in the franchise, is this one came out before The Purge (2013) I don't believe the franchise would have ever taken off the way that it has. The First Purge is plenty political, some horror and if you want to see a black man honestly save the day without a good white man to be seen you have to check this out though some call it propaganda, I say ""truth hurts."" Leave the kiddies and MAGA hatsFandango gods appeased, okay you want something genuinely controversial, *ahem* The First Purge was probably blacker than Black Panther, now I hear you all booing, being an African-American man from the suburbs what do I know, my grandmother's house was only Projects adjacent. I've never been to Africa and the only time I thought about it was to see what inspired the land of Wakanda, with The First Purge I was brought up with a ton of racially charged movies. A black crime lord is what is going to tick plenty of African-Americans off; this movie has some black on black crime, a killer high off everything and the hero; well, we'll get to that, no spoilers but get ready.Now any white people who use the word as I said propaganda has undoubtedly not seen the President and who he supports, if anyone is mad because of that, look in the mirror, and I will show you a racist. I think plenty of people missed the boat when it comes to The First Purge, always too much of something but I don't think there was enough purging, and that's one of the points, but I do think this movie is trying to imagine people as better than they are. At least when the purge first begins, this movie is not meant to be subtle by any means, it's focus and truly direct, a ""This Is America"" reference in your face like Childish Gambino and there is no spoon full of sugar, take your medicine. If you bury your head in the sand for all the references this movie displays, it's still one hell of a ride, if you like guns, your heroes manly, and as was said in the trailer, you'll see the best and the worst of people.Long story short, an experiment will take place on Staten Island they call The Purge, residents may leave if they choose but are offered five-thousand dollars to stay and are implanted to make sure. Those who wish to ""participate"" may earn more, what a way to find out who to purge and two opposite sides of the spectrum, Nya with no money and ""Dmitri"" played by Y'lan Noel, the rich drug dealer are saying the same thing, ""DO NOT PURGE."" We also have ""Dr. Updale"" played by Marisa Tomei... excuse me for not recognizing her, but who I agree with well her concept even if it was proven wrong, right...Politics, Horror, action aside, the President is a racist for those of you who don't know and you see this when Dr. Updale's theory is disproven and the NFAA steps in, with full KKK, Nazi, and *gasp* cop uniforms, where one man is beaten to death by the police. It gets worse in another scene we see armed white men leaving a church, where they have shot the congregation to death. In one of the lesser gruesome moments, let's call it a Trump moment when Nya feels the hands of an ""unknown"" assailant and three guesses as to what he was feeling for, she'll tell you as she runs away.Another reason people will hate this movie besides facing themselves is that sometimes you only want to quiet your mind for a bit, but this is The First Purge I'm talking about; you sort of know what you're about to watch. Show somebody that knows nothing about America and isn't white, and they might seriously reconsider coming here, which might show how great this country is, if this doesn't scare them away that's for sure. The reason I'll give The First Purge four stars (Fandango Scale) is because it couldn't figure out what it truly wanted to be, better than one, lesser than Anarchy, I would tie it with Election Night. If I haven't given too much away up to this point, prepare for spoilers but movies these days give too much away at this time, but somethings got to me here and there, both great and annoying just saying.Near the end, the film says, okay you know who's going to survive let's have our leading man kill some Nazis and have him be redeemed back with his lady and the community, though you know in the long run they failed as The Purge went nationwide. In ways, this movie will hurt you, but we can't forget, how the ruling party talks ""thoughts and prayers"" while Nya and Dmitri show that we must take action. It was ironic that all the guns Dmitri's crew bought up that the NFAA thought would be used to kill the poor came back when they fought against the goons the NFAA brought in.A few of my favorite parts, when Dmitri and company helped out ""The Three Wiseman"" from a KKK raid, and how the citizens themselves would not surrender even when they were out of bullets and were ready for the final attack. The battle of Nya's building when Dmitri let loose on the Nazis, and Nya with her brother took up arms despite both having failed to kill anybody for the majority of the movie at that point. Who didn't like the killer prostitutes, that took me back to my days of playing Saints Row: The Third, talk about predictable but yes most of the movie was you have to roll with it, well you might.You should; you have to if you don't think we're approaching these days, hell you might even say we're there because how are some people punished again but others will believe this movie is punishment enough. For me, I've stopped myself from seeing it again a couple of times while I'm out and about, if I want to watch this country descend into madness, I'll watch the news tonight seriously Fairytales of The First Purge.",The First Purge

Being a cat we do get into fights but nobody usually kills anyone. ""The First Purge"" tells the story of how this crazy experiment started. The event started in Staten Island, New York . They paid residents $5000.00 to stay on the island for the event. I watched some of the other Purge movies and they always have these strange looking people running the event. Marisa Tomei, who usually ends up in better movies plays ""Dr.Updale"" who created the experiment. It was ordered by the ""New Founding Fathers of America"", the political party that overtook the country. It kind of reminds of the ""Trump"" adminstration. ""Arlo Sabian"" The Founding Fathers Adminstration Chief of Staff played by Patch Darragh added some more stuff to the experiment and did some pretty awful things.To keep as many citizens alive the hero of the movie was ""Dmitri"" played by Y'lan Noel. He was actually a local gangster but became a local hero when people started killing his friends as part of the experiment. ""N'ya"" played by Lex Scot Davis was a protestor telling people not to participate. She was joined by her brother ""Isaiah"" played by Joivan Wade. Other people fighting the fight included her neighbor ""Delores"" played by ""Mugga"" The movie had the strangest images of people dressed up in all sorts of characters. What made me happy is that I didn't see any cats or dogs purging, which is good. There were no pets in the movies at all. If they showed a dead cat or dog Mom would freak out. She shared with me that her Dad, My Human Grand Dad, actually walked out of ""Dances With Wolves"" when the wolf died. He could not stand any animals to be killed. Mom inherited the same gene.As ""Purge"" movies go this one was interesting but I think the concept is strange.

334,pingchiehgrace,BEST PURGE,10,4 July 2018,"DISCLAIMER: Okay, I am not sure why there are so many low critic ratings. This made me feel compelled to write a review for the film, and balance it all out. I have been a fan of the previous purge movies for different reasons than the reason I like this film. (Those home invasion flicks were just silly gory horror/thrillers for rainy nights to watch under the pillows and blankets). This film is a total departure from the previous in tonality and social commentary. ALL the plot holes are closed and it finally treats the film with some seriousness to it. This is more of an action film than a horror, and I like it. So I can only surmise that the reason the rating on IMDB is so low is not a lot of people haven't gone to see it yet. Those that did went in thinking it would be like the others, so they were disappointed. IT IS NOT. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER.REVIEW: The story of the First Purge opens strongly. It introduces a character called Skeletor, who is a re-occurring figure, and hints at the motives behind those who would seek to perpetrate violence. It also shows the perspective of those behind the ""Experiment"" on Staten Island. The New Founding Fathers (NFF) are a political organization that have rose to prominence in the wake of extreme violence and disruption in the USA. (I believe ACTUAL footage or something chillingly similar to it was used to showcase the state of America. Not surprisingly, it looks a lot like what you'd see on TV today if you turned on any news channel.)The NFF have convinced Americans that it is important to find a permanent solution to this imminent problem of overpopulation and civic unrest. They make it seem very believably so that the livelihood and well being of all of America is threatened. (Remember the Trailers? America needs to be ""Made Great Again"".) This is very similar to the stuff going on in Baltimore, Detroit, heck almost any major city in the USA right now. There is police brutality. People protesting the government. Sporadic violence. Looting. Robbery. General fear and paranoia. Race rioting. Etc. It's not a far stretch to see how this extends to real life sentiments. 
 
So, the demographically favorable (aka mixture of really low income and really diverse population pool) of Staten Island is chosen for this social study. Mostly the world is interested in watching what happens and does nothing to intervene although they comment this is barbaric. The island votes and the majority decides it would be something they would like to participate in! (Of course! Don't think this could happen? Let me remind you things like Brexit and bombings in Syria occurred in 2017. The world stood by and verbally decried it but did nothing. Fear can dominate reason, where citizens vote against their best interests without understanding the full implications of their actions. Violence against innocents can occur but people will not want to be involved in ""other people's problems."") Therefore, in the movie, participants will be allowed to commit any crimes they wish for up to 12 hours without any consequences so long as they stay to 'participate'. Who would choose to stay on the island? This question has been asked a lot, including on a very lively Reddit thread. To sweeten the pot to ensure this study has ample data (as with all clinical trials), the NFF offers $5000 ""compensation"" to anyone who stays on the island during the experiment. Of course, increasing levels of ""participation"" will result in increasing rewards - provided that the participant survives the study. I know some people from a middle or upper middle income class might have difficulty understanding why anyone would risk their life for such a small amount. But having been around lower income areas and been exposed to poverty, I understand the difference that amount of money can make on someone who is really desperate. Consider that in the USA, the 
average American would not know how to handle an unexpected $500 bill. It can be easy to see how one could be lulled into a false sense of security that this is a relatively easy way to make a big change in their life. If there were medical bills to pay, horrific living conditions, etc. From a political perspective, the NFF believe that the ""problem"" will take care of itself. It is expected that gangs will use this opportunity to take out other gangs. The poor who are unhappy and prone to unrest will be left free to their own devices. This movie is so good because it is well acted, realistic and relevant. It has characters that are believable. Motivations that are relatable. AND it is entertaining.",The First Purge
335,jackastrodude,Why the hell was this necessary,4,11 July 2018,Honestly I think the idea of using soldiers and mercenaries in the Purge is considered cheating.

341,rose-57741,Best of the purge movies...HANDS DOWN!,9,23 September 2018,"I don't understand why this movie has so many poor ratings. 
The movie was very honest. Think about lynchings that took place in the past. Whites would come from neighboring counties to join in and to kill innocent people. 
Many of the negative reviews will come from whites and not minorities, because this movies holds a mirror of their ancestors transgressions in front of them. Transgressions that they still today benefit from. 
Another reason why some might not like the movie, is that it shows who Blacks really are. Yes they do things day to day that are not perfect, but if there is no need to harm, they don't. Which is why there was very little participation by the minorities. 
Also, when it was needed, they stuck together and took care of one another. Compare the way that they minorities responded to the purge in this movie, to the way that whites responded to it in all of the other movies. BIG DIFFERENCE!

353,Jburhans1978,Terrible movie,1,23 August 2021,"There are 2 main criteria in which I base whether or not I like a movie. First is if I have to check the time. If I do, I have lost interest and the movie is too long for me. (It could be an hour and a half movie or 3 hours). The second criteria is that I have to identify with a character and root for them in some way. There has to be a likability factor. This movie didn't satisfy either of those criteria. I was checking the time about 35 mins into it because the first half moved entirely too slow. Nothing happened. The only character I actually really liked was the neighbor with asthma, but she was only in the movie for like 15 mins. The sister was ok, and I did root for her, but I wasn't 100% on board. And the drug dealer turned hero...that's a hard no for me.When I saw the original Purge movie, I always wanted to know how the purge got started...but this movie was not the answer I was looking for.

After the complete train-wreck of a third that was 'Election Year' this movie brought the franchise back to life and gave it more of an understanding. They delve into why people do the things they do when they purge, what people thought was and wasn't acceptable when the 'social experiment' first arose... yeah ok, so the movie has its clichè moments, but some of the issues they touch on are very much real life... the struggle for people with little to no income, the things people would do to gain income at such a time, and the way that the government can pretty much do anything to make themselves look good.

If your a fan of the others watch this, if your not a fan of the others watch this anyway its an origin story that can oddly be relateable in the world we live in today.
This film is good 7/10 actual but had to put 10/10 for the haters. The story is very relevant for todays world in a weird dystopian kind of way. For people who call this film racist, your are just blindly watching the film & not understanding the message/story thats being told. They did go over the top on the stereotypes but it is very relateable. The rich & powerful trying to get rid of the low income society, who have little to no choice on being in that bracket due to the oppourtunitys given & way they are percieved.

When this prequel came out that was about the very first experimental Purge, I was a little intrigued but not super interested. One day after I got off work and was waiting to pick my brother up from the train station, I had a few hours to kill, so I used my MoviePass to kill some time while watching ""The First Purge"". It was super boring and not very fun to watch. The characters sucked and it wasn't anything new from what has been done already.

All these are based on real things, though. And not all the ""bad guys"" are white like some of the other comments/reviews say. Many other black characters try to kill the protagonists. And you have to remember that the NFFA use many disguises like the KKK or other supremacist groups to hunt down people in the movie.

There's nothing like having a hero you can root for.

If this was a standalone movie, it could be passable. Okay, it's a little predictable, and yes, like many other reviews, the hero (the local drug kingpin) seems to be a bad choice. My main problem is it's standing in the Purge series. This is the first ""purge"", an experiment in Staten Island. Halfway through the experiment, the NFFA are exposed to what the purge is really about:
Local residents are shown at the beginning that they are being paid to stay im the borough. Part way through the purge, a militia of mercs and white supremacists (hired by the NFFA) are tracking people down and executing them, including the climax scenes in the movie, where they are going door to door in an apartment block, killing residents in what can only be described as ethnic cleansing.
My big problem with this is, how would this ""experiment"" be considered a success? How would more purges follow this? How would it become an annual thing? How would the rest of the country see, and hear what happened say yes, that looks good, sign me up? It just wouldn't happen.",The First Purge

399,gamermon,Bad In Every Way,2,18 November 2018,"To put it simply, this was not a good movie. While all the purge movies haven't been particularly good at least you could get some suspenseful fun out of them, none of that in this one. Acting is horrible, screen is so dark sometimes it's hard to see what's happening, and oh my goodness plot holes out the wazoo. Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief when seeing movies, especially Purge movies, but we can only suspend so much.How did Skeletor know to find people multiple times? There was definitely no blade in his mouth while talking but suddenly one appears. Doesn't monetary compensation ruin the psychology they want to study? Did people just sit in one spot the entire night until our protagonist came along? What's with the futuristic technology but other purge movies which supposedly take place in the future have worse tech? Government was doing a lot of terrible things that surely would've been caught on camera, as everyone is shown with smartphones, and would've brought down the new regime. Soooo this drug lord has the combat ability to take down multiple mercenaries hand to hand without it being explained how? How come his gang can see well in smoke but the trained mercenaries can't? I realize this is getting long and trust me I could keep going as this is only scratching the surface.And finally obvious pushing racial divide is obvious. Every black person is portrayed as victims (mostly) and all the white people are portrayed as evil nazis and kkk (mostly). Now obviously I could believe if this situation somehow happened those groups would take advantage but I think for the sake of this movie couldn't we have it mixed? Like some white peoples in gang and some blacks with the mercs? At least then we could focus on the poor vs rich these movies seem to be about but I don't know, there are too many problems to count. Only reason it has a 2 is because of Tomei and one part that made me say ""oh that was cool.""",The First Purge

412,mynameiswood,Cheap Fun,7,4 July 2018,"For the record I'm not going to begin this review by defending my score with something like: it's not intended to be clever, well written, e.t.c. I don't believe it's ok to give horror films, like this, a free pass, because they're geared towards a mainstream audience who don't want to indulge in to much social commentary, and would rather mindlessly watch a multitude of characters die gruesome deaths. With that out of the way...
I was pleasantly surprised by The First Purge, to me it felt as if they'd learnt their lesson from their last two installments and decided to go back to basics, a concentrated event that isn't over bloated by showing the audience multiple different Purge scenarios. Therefore, I found it much more entertaining, because it felt like this one had direction, a real message, rather than being a sizzle-reel of murders with plot tied in just to explain how the characters got from one place to another. As always the action was entertaining and creative, so for the most part there isn't really anything to complain about there and where former complaints lied, from the other movies, like choice of music, or stylistic choices were also surprisingly great.I do have a few complaints:
The pacing of this installment is slower than the others, largely because there's the set up of how the Purge began, but it's noticeable enough to be enjoying. I also found the dialogue very unrealistic and it made me cringe many times throughout the film; it's very noticeable that the 'hood' (black) dialogue was written by someone who has no experience with the way black people in tower block communities, and unsurprisingly it was written by someone who isn't black them self. Occasionally, a few characters felt generic, with their goals and background/personality, but it was something that didn't take me out of the experience, so it weren't detrimental, but it was still noticeable.
Overall, my complaints this time round felt quite minor and in know severely impacted my experience of the film.It was a riot of a time from start to end, and that's why I've given The First Purge a 7/10.Side Note: My opinions of the movie may be exasperated, due to my expectations going in, and my taste in general. However, one things for sure if you like senseless violence, and well choreographed action, I can guarantee you'll at least be satisfied by the price of admission.",The First Purge

419,hockeychik,"I would have given it an 8, but the haters forced my hand.",10,6 July 2018,"I really enjoyed this film. My husband and I won free early-screening passes at a 98 rock booth in Sacramento, and I was initially less than thrilled at the prospect of viewing the film. As my husband is a fan of horrors/thrillers, I went along for the ride... just to be kind. And neither of us was disappointed.This movie was politically charged; and quite appropriately so. There are zero reasons the American public would support a political stunt of this nature, and less than zero reasons a psychologist, psychiatrists, therapist, or mental health specialist would encourage a hostile and deadly trial of this magnitude (not simply taking into account the ethics and stipulated parameters put into place since atrocities like the Stanford Prison Experiment -not to mention the Holocaust). The premise of every single film prior to this was haphazard at best. So the filmmakers/authors/writers/consultants took this into account, considered the current political climate, and truly pondered reasons why the Purge may have been developed. The movie is clearly fiction. This needn't be clarified. But if it WERE to actually happen, then some seriously shady shenanigans would have to be going down. Given America's history, and the present political climate, there could be something to say about the support of the forced hostility displayed in this film. I would have given it an 8, but the haters forced my hand. I loved the characters. Their motivations were clear, and their backstories fit. The fact that very few initially participated, and it took the instigation of outside forces with ulterior motives to inspire any real violence, illustrates the reality of humanity. We aren't inherently evil. Humanity is not motivated entirely by Freud's Id. We all have choices we must make. Some are harder than others. And sometimes we must step outside of our typical moral boundaries to protect those we love. There are a few that fall outside the typical scope of human nature, those who might need significant mental health care, like Skeletor, but ultimately there is good in all of us. And when the good is difficult to find, it's likely due to detrimental environmental factors that have warped our moral compasses beyond recognition. But this is a societal issue. Which is exactly the picture this film paints. Independently, previous Purge movies may have tried to illustrate that good exists even outside of painful circumstances, but only on a few specific instances. This movie paints a more realistic picture, even if on a canvas that is purely meant for fantasy-... horrible, painful, and decrepit fantasy.",The First Purge

Overall I thought the movie was decent and fun to watch. But like all movies there were some issues that The First Purge had that made the movie struggle a little in my opinion. One issue that the movie had that made me not enjoy it that much was the lack of kills that this purge movie had. I felt like this movie didn't enough kills that the other three had. Another issue was that most of the jump scares were really predictable.

Loop steal, rob to make their way of living better, but murder comes with a side of psychological trauma.

Main character is courageous and brutal, but still finds a way to be likeable to the audience. 
As someone who likes Blumhouse movies, this is nothing different. These movies are low budget for a reason, so even if the blood not looking so real doesn't throw me off, because you just have to believe it's real. That's how these movies work. Characters made dumb decisions (as in every movie), but what do you expect in a horror movie? 10/10 would watch again.",The First Purge
425,GhostInTheRentalStore,So bad... it's just bad,1,5 July 2018,"This movie sucks. Like really sucks. In general the Purge movies always have something dumb or stupid in them. Fine whatever turn off your brain and enjoy. Not this one though. This movie was so dumb, and so implausible. I need to see a doctor for rolling my eyes so hard. I can't believe someone greenlit this movie. Like someone sat down and read this script and thought it was good enough to make into a movie. And then other people gave millions of dollars so this movie could be made. That's just sad. Thinking of all the other better movies that could've been made instead of this. People just do dumb things in this movie. Like why do the people running from the killers turn on the lights to their apartment? Why that feisty woman neighbour is talking/shouting at the top of her lungs so any random purger can walk in and finish the job? Why the brother was going to Brooklyn to avoid the purge, but not his sister? Why does the sister go to the church for safety when it's pretty much the same or better in her own apartment? Overall I thought the cast was fine, but they just weren't given much to do in this movie. It's cliche after cliche, and presented in the most over the top way possible. Almost every character in the movie is a cliche. The tough but tender sister who is trying to provide a better life for her brother. The gang leader with the heart of gold, and deep down he's a caring person. Until he isn't. The brother who wants a better life, but keeps making stupid decisions. The evil Skeletor who's only sole purpose in the movie is to be evil. Like really really evil. He just goes around Michael Myers style taking people out casually. Who's victims are just standing there like packaged meat in a supermarket. Not one person in that street party has a gun or weapon of some sort? Why are they all running away from him? I thought this was the purge?I know there's social political commentary throughout this movie. It just wasn't very effective. Everything is presented so ham fisted, and serious (in their minds). That it just takes all the fun out of the movie. I don't know if I should even BE enjoying this movie. I thought this was a B movie? Well it is but... It takes complex themes, and boils them down to it's simplest form. I was almost expecting the camera to pull away, and we find out it's some parent reading their kid some bedtime purge story. Time to purge this movie from my mind.",The First Purge
426,epy-47087,Needs to find a balance,6,7 July 2018,"While my favorite sequel of the franchise so far it still isn't very good. It takes itself way too seriously. For example, the first half of the film is devoted to character development and it does not do a good job with it. The acting in the early scenes is heavy handed and often times unrealistic. As another example, a major pet peeve of mine is when characters constantly answer with ""sis"" or ""bro"". It's just really awkward. I will give it to the director I really liked the way some of the scenes were filmed. The humor that was injected in when the purge first starts made sense and was enjoyable. Overall, it's a mindless campy horror film with a heavy handed political message that it keeps throwing in your face as if you can't take all the obvious visual clues. It is a fun view if you want to watch an okay movie or already are a fan of the franchise/genre.",The First Purge

430,itsjas,"Not great, but not bad.",7,20 July 2018,"The abundance of 1-star ratings from angry white people are not at all surprising. It was anticipated actually, and it's quite amusing. I'll begin by saying this is definitely not the best of the films in the franchise. It's the usual ""keeps you on your toes"", gory action type of movie, plus or minus a jump scare here and there. Pretty gory like the movies before it, definitely very creepy, ominous vibes throughout. For the most part I was entertained. The storyline was decent, actors were pretty damn good actually, and I don't feel like my money was wasted. Does this movie take an obvious political stance? Absolutely. They didn't release it July 4th for nothing. In this movie you'll see references to KKK, nazis, and overall whites versus blacks. What people seem to be forgetting is that even though this is a fictional movie, the Purge is intended to be interpreted as a realistic scenario. Historically, white people have killed and enjoyed killing minorities. That's literally a fact. Blacks, Native Americans, the Holocaust, you name it. Plenty of examples in history and even present day of white people's violence against those who they deem weaker or less than them, and if you don't believe me, the internet is free. Look it up. That being said, if there was ever going to be something like a Purge, it would definitely be white people who start it lol. I'm not understanding why people are offended by that, it's the most realistic origin they could use for these particular films given the topic. Also, I find it funny how white people in the reviews are like ""KKK?!!! NAZIS?!! Whites are the BAD GUYS?!!"" ""RACE-BAITING, PROMOTING DIVISIVENESS!!!"" I mean y'all say that like there wasn't KKK and Nazi rallies just last year, HELL, even this year! They're upset like the film was all made-up stuff and that's the funniest part. The Purge itself is made up, but the hate groups, not so much. Sorry to break it to you. There was and still is large groups of crazy white supremacists out here, this film simply calls them out.

And I'll prove it by talking about Marissa Tomei's character, the second her character saw that they were manipulating the ""experiment"" she wasn't on board. She was a victim too.Also, this is an alternate universe and it explores bigger and deeper themes than black vs white. It's about class warfare and the willingness of the rich to dispose of the poor as if throwing a way a kleenex. It just so happens that the poor are heavily depicted as black, which is true.I think they need to show another ""first purge"" movie where they show how the poor rural whites are eliminated just as much as the black urban poor. But this isn't just a simple matter of white vs black.This really comes down to the dangers of making any group, ""the other"" because when you think of them as thugs, murderers, rapists and some of them I assume are good people, it opens the door to treat people as no better than bugs.If you don't like the political themes of this movie, stay away.

The income wage gap in the United States is terrible, and the film itself creates an alternative timeline where situations are direr for the middle and working-class than they are in our reality.The movie isn't 'politically charged' yet, much like the first film of the franchise, it exposes those who are trapped in a narrow frame of mind. The plot explains everything several reviewers complain over.However, there were points in the plot where the writing was lazy, the narrative failed to tell a complex story, and the movie ends earlier. The acting was pretty good, with Y'lan Noel and Lex Scott Davis putting on good performances.Overall, it's an okay prequel that needed more depth, but isn't anywhere near as problematic as those who have a problem with the melanin content of some of the antagonists.True Score: 5.9/10",The First Purge

The action is good, especially in the tower near the end. One fight on the stairs reminded me of John Wick, where the camera just sits there and films, rather than have 50 different shots of each punch.

As a Native American, black citizen of the US I felt overwhelmed with gratification by the unapologetic behavior exerted toward white supremacists, as they have no regard for my race whatsoever.Y'Lan Noel's performance was exceptional, alongside the final cue portrayed by Rotimi Paul. The amount of black cast members was refreshing as well.",The First Purge

Portrays minorities as protagonists (I'm a minority all for that) but they're all gangsters and drug dealers killing whites portrayed as KKK and Nazi-inspired militiamen.

I felt like it was logical and if this were to happen it would indeed happen the way it did in the movie. If your huge into the other ones this one is great and as a whole it is a good franchise.

479,faisal-fk,"Good decent movie, not you normal narrative and rating has been distorted by the haters due to racial politics",10,22 September 2018,"Don't think I've laughed so much in a long time. To explain.So when it comes to Hollywood, overwhelmingly most movies portray black, ethnic minorities, Johnny foreigner in a negative light unless they are 'saved' and conform to some western norm/ideal. The hero's predominately white with all their character flaws overcome their personal demons to rise to the challenge of the hero.So in the ultra rare instance when a movie comes along and the white guys are predominately the bad guys while the black guys are the good guys, and in a similar way rise to the challenge, then we see an outpouring of outrage with cries of its racial stereotyping.Read the comments here on IMDB where the lowest possible star rating is being awarded by the outraged, maybe they need to do the same for the thousands of movie racially stereotyping white is good, black is bad.This is a lesson in how the veil of tolerance is dropped as it really hits a nerve to be collectively described as the bad guy and when a narrative that has been pushed for centuries is turned on its head.Maybe it's being collectively demonised as a race? Maybe it's the uncomfortable truth to the reality of the world, where the main agressor and exploiter of the world for the last few centuries has been white men in the form of colonialism (Brtish, French, Dutch etc) and more recently in this century, US invasion after invasion, regime change after regime change. Maybe its the parallels drawn in this fictitious dystopian movie to contempory world order, the rise of the far right across the world and in particular the USA, the uncomfortable relationship with the NRA (National Rifle Association), mainstream politics and right wing militias. Maybe its the relationship between the black community and the very organisations that are meant to protect them but instead they suffer indifference, marginalisation and injustice regularly resulting in being 'purged'.I say to them here's a movie that has got you to think and respond emotionally, I'm giving the movie a 10/10As for everyone else watch it, the ratings have been distorted by the haters.",The First Purge

The haters gonna hate but this movie deserves more credit than a 1 or 2.,The First Purge
482,funnybabe95,This is reality,10,7 July 2018,"I haven't always been a fan of the purge movies until the second and third one hit the big screens. The amount of social commentary and political views can be overwhelming for some people. I understand a lot of people are disgusted with overt racism that is shown in this movie towards white people and that it causes more of divide than a unity between race groups and I agree in some spots. But honestly, it must be shown to open people's eyes to reality. A lot of low-income families are struggling to survive and the first purge shows what any person would do to overcome debt and obtain stability in a world full of greed. The violence of this film is overwhelming and is used to distract people from its underlying concept of a government system that not only forgets its stuggling people, but creates a diversion to get rid of people who they are not proud of. Another reason why people are upset with this film is because the hero of the film is a known drug dealer on the streets. But what do people expect? He aids his community to become stronger, he pays attention to its needs, and he protects people. People are drawn to protection, safety, reassurance. This hero turns out to be what the government should be for it's people. Sorry he ends up being a drug dealer. The film is worth the watch in my opinion, but not for people who are extremely closed minded of its underlying themes.",The First Purge

Nothing.....except maybe this issue I am bringing up in here. There wasn't any bad acting. Skeletor got my attention for sure.....I don't want that dude anywhere near me!!

484,missmevs,Absolute Trash - Avoid,1,12 July 2018,"Considering I loved the first 3 I paid extra to see this in a fully kitted out cinema. What a waste of time and money that was. The opening Scene had me already wondering about the stereotypes and implications we were about to endure but I had no idea How much this would continue throughout. 
The concept that poor blacks and Hispanics will kill each other for money because they are so desperate to escape poverty and the only options are working in a corner shop or selling drugs is just so outdated, stereotypical and bias. 
I found myself squirming and wanted to look away at this poor excuse for a film. It was almost like a cross between new jack city, menace to society some 80s teenage horror. All the characters were so 1 dimensional and even the parts were we were supposed to care lacked any real emotion or empathy. I think what ruined it more than anything was that the whole idea of the purge has always been about decreasing crime and allowing people to purge and get their anger out. 
The implication of this film was that if America is to survive we need to cleanse the ghetto's of all the people who are making America worse... this undertone of 'making America great again' by targeting the poor and ethnic people is just too close to home and not what this was supposed to be about.Incredibly disappointed.",The First Purge

The First Purge had a great story, characters, and suspenseful scenes for movie goers. The characters in this movie were enjoyable to watch. Nya was the strong, caring heroine. Dolores provided a great comic relief during intense scenes and throughout the movie. Even Dimitri was interesting and his character arc was great to watch and became a surprising hero for the film. This film showed a population who are not well represented, or thought of during The Purge which is a reflection of the US today. Despite what reviews say, this film is not race baiting, or political propaganda. It's a great movie and definitely worth a watch.",The First Purge

The First Purge has genuine moments of thrill and excitement and puts character development in the back seat which is okay with me.

Almost every movie I watch I like and I'm not a harsh movie critic. I watched it with a group of 8 friends and once we got past the initial awkwardness of the movie everyone was laughing at the awful acting and story line. At the end one of the characters says ""it's over"" and I heard 2 people in the audience simultaneously say ""thank god"". This movie was so forced and had an obvious agenda .

A movie that can bring out so much hate and close-mindedness that we've seen in these reviews, is a movie that has something to say.Yeah, the movie takes longer to start up. But we really understand the story of how it all started. The acting is GREAT, some of the fight scenes are wonderful. I think based on the previous purge movies we have certain expectations of what this movie should be- it is different, but that doesn't mean it's bad.I think what we need to ask ourselves is: Why are white people so mad about this movie?",The First Purge

492,nataliejeffrey,Don't know what all the negativity is about.....,10,9 July 2018,"This review section must be filled with easily offended conservatives because all I've heard is complaining about the political devices in this movie.That's honestly something I belive the movie did very right. They showed the growing divide between the upper and lower class and those who support the purge and those who don't. This is something that is currently plaguing our nation and I think this was huge for a movie like this to use it as a plot point because it made it seem almost plausible for something like this to happen when America is at its worst. The acting was great in my opinion, and I thought that I really connected and felt for the main characters and was routing for them throughout the movie whereas in previous movies I found myself caring very little about a lot of the main characters and their well-being.Overall I recommend this movie for sure. Was it my favorite? I wouldn't say that. Would I actually give it 10 stars if my goal here wasn't to piss off all those giving it one star? Probably not, I would say a solid 7 or 8 would do it justice just fine. But I think it's a worthwhile movie to watch if you want to see where the purge came from, what fueled it, and quite honestly what exactly the true message the directors have been trying to get across this entire time is.",The First Purge

As an avid fan of the Horror/thriller/slasher genre this was a big let-down on many levels. They marketed it as a thrill filled movie such as its predecessors but all I saw was a poorly written movie filled with more liberal views than i could keep track of. Outside world politics should not have a place in films unless it is to further the plot and add to it, whereas in this movie all it did was take me out of the viewing experience and dropped me into the middle of the 2016 election. Regarding the rest of the movie, it started off ""OK"" but it veered into a different direction after the first 30-40 minutes and started going downhill.
I was left in my seat watching people kill each other with knifes and guns in the most bland way I have seen. Dumb jump-scares, unexciting action scenes and (only some) awful acting. 1.5/10",The First Purge

That being said, I think this movies was okay. The people that are complaining about race, are mostly white people. The fact of the matter is Racism is real, and there is a divide. The undertone of all the purges is that the minority are exploited and targeted the most, and with every new purge it becomes more obvious. The purge movies may be a little stereotypical in terms of that racism, but it's no different than black characters in majority white movies being portrayed as stereotypical blacks, so stop complaining. In fact it is different because it doesn't happen often.I enjoyed this movie, I was tuned in. The fighting was definitely the best in all of the purges. It was more skilled, more precise. The story was different than I expected, but overall not bad. I would watch again, and I wish I supported it in the movie theater.",The First Purge

I think some people can't handle a movie that had black heroes unless those heros wear mask.At some point in the movie, it went from being about the government's answer to poor people to a movie about people taking back their neighborhood. The people in question are morally questionable people but it works perfect with the idea of this movie. There a action for those who want it. There's a creepy factor for horror fans. There is a moral delima that'll keep everyone talking. There is a hero for those who can relate to coming from a poor neighborhood and not wanting to see it or it's people made a mockery of in from off the whole world.Basically, it's a great movie and anyone who reads this movie lower than Truth or Dare is just racist and cannot live with black people who don't act the way they want them to act.

However, I still decided to give it a go because my sister works at the theater and got us both in free and I wouldn't have to waste money. All though I didn't waste the money, I regret wasting my time with the movie. The movie was lacking in multiple aspects and just fell short. The plot of a first purge could have been awesome, but it just wasn't. The story seemed to shift way too much between multiple plots instead of providing a quality overarching story for the audience. Acting was flat for the most part, but some of it seems to be due to the behind the scenes staff and writing. Parts of the movie seemed cheesy and laughable. Some parts can be ignored, while others will have you shaking your head. There were some cool aspects of the movie, but not enough to warrant the movie with a solid rating. All in all, the movie was a bust in my opinion. I enjoyed the two previous purge movies, and was disappointed that this one was just mediocre. I would recommend waiting for the movie to come to redbox before checking it out if you want to watch it.Sorry for typos, reviewed with IPhone.",The First Purge

I also really enjoyed how they used a majority of African-Americans in this movie. The sound track was lit! music had people vibin in the theaters.

I have seen all the others and feel that this is the worst of the series. There is almost no character development, there appears to be a very strong racial agenda, too, in that blacks appear to be virtually unanimously against whites. Most importantly there is very little explanation as to why the purge came about. I would give this film 2 stars simply due to the action scenes, which are moderately entertaining at times. Definitely an anticlimax to The Purge Election Year that I feel is the strongest, closely followed by The Purge Anarchy.",The First Purge

The government does pray on the poor and poverty level in society, and the only people that think differently are the ones privileged enough to never have to go through it.People are hating on this movie because they believe a certain way about politics these days and do not want to see anything that depicts the real truth. The truth hurts as they say and its hurting a lot of peoples feelings. This movie is a must see for those who have enjoyed seeing the growth in the films over the years.

No therapist would come up with any idea close to this thats not harley quin. We in the black community really dont need these movies to be seen divisive tools that dont find away of explaining the poverty situation for real, drugs or just the actual way people think. But hey what movie does? For a fiction movie its however I think its a cool concept. I think the reason some dont like this movie is because it portrays all the people in power as evil white males and it makes people uncomfortable however the original founder fathers werent pure sweet men either so.. And its a ficitional government in a ficitional world. Lets not get to deep its a movie treat it as such.The sister character that was trying to save her brother was a nice touch. The drug dealer in the blazer get up in the projects was hilarious! All in all if you like gore this would be a great film for you.

545,seriousdelirious,A Solid if Imperfect Prequel,7,10 August 2018,"Many of these IMDb users are hatin' on this movie simply because they look at that screen and don't see faces/characters/situations that they can relate to. That's fine because that's going to be true for most audiences, but by no means does that make this a bad movie. It just means this movie wasn't made for them.It was made for people who can relate to the obvious real-life metaphors this film hits on: financial desperation, a scarily-real governmental turn toward autocracy under-girded by racism and exploitation of the urban poor, and the unpredictable spasms of people who REALLY ARE losing it in these tumultuous times.The plot and story are no less solid than the simplicity of the other films: a menagerie of characters looking to survive the night, with their own agendas, despite structural forces at work against and unknown to them. Yet, what mass American audience wants to identify with a drug-dealer-turned-urban-Rambo in the main action hero Dmitri (Y'lan Noel)? The catharsis of all movies (but especially dystopian films because of the creepy sub-textual realism) is in getting absorbed emotionally into relatable characters. Most audiences can't relate to Dmitri or Nya (Lex Scott Davis). Those familiar with the hood can; or at least those that can imagine that perspective.In that sense, The First Purge veers toward Blaxploitation, and it's un-apologetic about it. Yet the sight of Neo-Nazis going door-to-door in legal extermination IS actually terrifying as real-life white supremacists emboldenment across the country is encouraged by autocratic fervor.As far as dystopian sci-fi goes, we're far closer to that possibility than most audiences want or can imagine. That's part of what makes this film compelling if not technically as slick as the others (which IS admittedly disappointing given a bigger budget than the last).The last film, Election Year began the politics of the series; with upwards of $80 million gross on a $10 million budget, a politics most audiences had little problem with.This film is a logical (in a prequel kind of way) next step in the obvious political turn the series took in the last film, only the perspective turns the lens primarily on the plight of the urban poor and criminally enterprising and those in power manipulating things behind the scenes. As for the hood perspective, you're not seeing ""bad acting"" as some users have accused. It's acting and being that doesn't give a s#!% what outsiders of the hood perspective think.If you want to see credibly-creepy dystopian fair that's all-too-close to home--and if you're willing to identify with life on the other side of the tracks--this movie is worth a look, but don't expect the stylistic slickness of the other films.The First Purge is very low-fi compared to the others, but that doesn't make it low-worth. Only those who can't wipe away their lenses for a couple of hours would think that of an otherwise solid movie.",The First Purge

If we get desperate and vote for power thirsty party due to the hope they promise and political rhetoric, this is what happens. The movie is portraying that people are not animals as we see ourselves to be. If we are not desperate for survival we will all mind our own business or even party. It is the very few, those who have some scores to settle or who are out rightly bananas, will take advantage of such a situation. Those people are just a minute proportion of our population.

561,austinblakeman-49950,Decent,5,14 October 2018,"The First Purge was a decent movie at best. Don't get me wrong there were some things that I really liked about the movie such as, it being like a backstory to how the Purge came to be, and that they first tested it out among a specified area; that area being Staten Island, New York. Also, I did like the story, but I thought that they could have made the plot a little better. The bad's however, greatly outweigh the goods in my opinion. First off, I did not like how they targeted only one economic population. Not only did they offer money to just the poor people who stayed in the city while the purge was going on, they offered it only to the poor, African American community. Throughout the movie, there was black on black killing, but as it got deeper into the movie, it showed a group of ""white supremists"" going into a black church and murdering everyone in there. There was also a scene towards the end of the movie that showed what seemed to be people dressed as Hitler and his regime going from floor to floor and room to room exterminating everyone they saw. To me this just pokes at what happens in the real world and peoples perception of it. It kind of makes fun of the controversy between white cops killing African American people, and honestly I think it just stirs up the pot a bit. In addition, I did not like how they made the younger African American male seem like he was the main character, when to me, it was the guy at the end of the movie who saved everybody. There were also somethings in the movie that I felt were pointless and did not need to be addressed. One such example, was the fact that they had to point out how Dmitri was a drug dealer. I thought that it really did not play a big role in the movie and was just unnecessary information. Another thing, is that there is not really any character development and the movie is honestly pretty predictable. I do think that everyone should watch this movie to truly understand where I am coming from, but do not expect to be very impressed by it.",The First Purge

The series has been subtle, but very political in its past movies, but this movie couldn't have been more blatant at what point they were trying to get across. White men with KKK uniforms, Nazi emblems, black faced white men, any form of racial entity was prevalent. The movie basically became villainous white men vs. the heroic poor ""hood"" black men. I don't know how much more racial and stereotypical you could have become. To top it off, the white president created this chaos in a corrupt government plot to take out the black race in the slums of New York.

A solution was proposed: Let's provide an environment where people can kill each other.It only stands to reason that the subjects of this experiment would be lower income communities. This is obviously the case because these people were incentivized to participate. This wouldn't work in more affluent areas because it would destabilize the country for rich and powerful ceo's and politicians to be killed. Who live in lower income areas? Black and Hispanics.You'd be hard-pressed to find black and hispanic mercs to go in and kill poor black and hispanic people. So of course it'd be white people.The movie actually follows logic given its premise. The population needs to be lowered. Poor people are expendable.
