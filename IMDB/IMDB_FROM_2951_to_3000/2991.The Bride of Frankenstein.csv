0,MartinHafer,the best of the Frankenstein films,10,30 March 2006,"While I really liked FRANKENSTEIN (1931), I loved THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. That's because in addition to all the wonderful cinematography and scientific gadgetry that gave the film so much eye candy, this film features an even better script and the monster was able to grow a lot as a character--even learning to speak. Plus, in addition to the kooky Dr. Frankenstein, the even more psychotic and humorous Dr. Pretorius is along for the ride as well. Pretorius is played so well by Ernest Thesiger that's a shame he wasn't seen in more films--he played the best crazed doctor in film history.The film begins with the apparent death of the monster. The camera pans into the foundation of the windmill that was burned (along with the monster) in the first film. An old gent goes down to explore--only to be killed by the understandably angry monster (who now looks a pretty singed thanks to the fire). Unfortunately, this leads to the WORST part of the film and that is the wife of this poor murder victim. Una O'Conner, the world's most annoying screaming character actress, begins bellowing so loudly and with so much excess emotion that I wanted to kill her myself. Man was she annoying--too bad the monster left her alone--a double-murder here would have been greatly appreciated! He wanders about--hungry, scared and in need of shelter but hated by all. This leads to the best, but saddest part of the film, when he meets an old blind man. The blind guy doesn't see that it's a ""monster"" and welcomes the creature into his home. He teaches him to talk a little and everything looks like it's heading for a happy ending--they seem to be fast friends. But, then some idiots come barging in an insist the monster must die--further solidifying the monster's hatred and distrust for mankind.The monster eventually stumbles into a cemetery and meets the really sick and twisted necrophile, Dr. Pretorius. The doctor is looking for body parts himself, as he likes the idea of creating more of the animated dead. He befriends the monster and convinces him that they must kidnap Dr. Frankenstein to get him to build a bride for the creature. Well, coincidentally, Dr. Frankenstein was just married when the monster and Pretorius show up and they force him to help in their mad scheme--because Mrs. Dr. Frankenstein will die if he doesn't cooperate.Well, at this point, you have the usual equipment and monster-making scenes. When the lady creature is completed, she rejects the monster and the monster pulls a lever that causes the equipment to blow all of them to a millions pieces. Well, that WAS the original ending. However, Carl Laemmle, the head of the studio, didn't like this downbeat ending (I sure would have) and ordered the film re-cut so that the monster decided to let Dr. and Mrs. Dr. Frankenstein go before blowing up himself, Pretorius and the angry bride. NOTE: if you look VERY CAREFULLY, when the castle blows up, you can see Dr. Frankenstein inside the castle even after he was shown leaving with his wife! Someone goofed and forgot to completely excise the original ending.This movie has it all--great acting, great script, wonderful direction, campy fun and excellent camera work. Despite the few minor flaws mentioned above, about as good as it gets when it comes to classic horror.",The Bride of Frankenstein
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the greatest achievements in the history of horrordom,10,2 May 2010,"I love the first Frankenstein, it was shocking and enthralling despite the complaints of it being dated and slow. Maybe so but I still love it. The Bride of Frankenstein is a wonderful sequel to an already wonderful film, and surpasses it technically I feel. Even if the acting is a little forced in the beginning scene, with the exception of Elsa Lanchester, that is such a minor flaw compared to how good and enjoyable this film was. If you ask me Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest achievements in the history of horrordom.First of all, it is extravagantly produced. The sets are really imaginative, the cinematography is beautiful and the costumes are extravagant. Along the way I noticed two improvements compared to the first film. One is that Bride of Frankenstein is faster in pace, and two the music score is more haunting and melancholic here, Franz Waxman was the perfect choice for composer. Bride of Frankenstein also has some really effective scenes, the ending was very well done as was the unveiling of the bride to the sound of wedding bells and the miniature people in the bell jars, but I found the scene between the monster and the blind hermit especially touching. James Whale's direction is innovative just like in the first film, and the script is also very good and adds to the atmosphere. The acting is excellent, Colin Clive is very good once again as the eccentric Henry Frankenstein, and Ernest Thesiger gives a genius turn as Doctor Pretorious. Valerie Hobson is alluring and sympathetic as Elizabeth, occasionally overdoing it with the hysteria but she was fine overall, while Elsa Lanchester is good as Mary Shelley but electrifyingly beautiful as the bride. Once again though, Boris Karloff gives the finest performance, his towering presence and frightening look ensures for some scares, but he is very poignant as well, as his monster only wants to fit in and is rejected by everybody.Overall, a wonderful sequel, and not to be missed! 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Bride of Frankenstein
2,bkoganbing,A Prisoner Of His Own Creation,9,16 January 2009,"Universal Studio in the height of the Hollywood Studio System was famous for three things that kept it in the black besides those famous studio tours that survive to this day. The Deanna Durbin musicals, the Abbott&Costello comedies and those great Gothic horror films with Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy and most of all Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Those sets were used over and over again, you can recognize them if you're a real student of the genre. Although some have criticized it, I rather like the beginning of Bride of Frankenstein in a Regency drawing room where the creative minds of Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, and Mary Shelley are meeting. Of course the subject gets around to how she would continue the story, it just can't end right there. So while Gavin Gordon as Byron and Douglas Walton as Percy Shelley listen, Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley starts to tell about the further doings of her characters.Of course Colin Clive as Victor Frankenstein thought dead when he was brought out of the ruin, turns out to be alive, but in need of medical attention. The monster is also not dead, he's been put together even stronger than an ordinary human. As is first two victims he kills the parents of the little girl he killed in the original Frankenstein film.While Clive is recuperating at home under the care of his wife played here by Valerie Hobson, Clive receives a visit from his former teacher and mentor who originally aroused his interest in experiments along this line. Ernest Thesiger is Doctor Praetorious, a scientist whose reputation is more dubious than that of Frankenstein. He's been experimenting with bringing people back to life and he shows his little creations to Frankenstein. What he describes sounds a lot like cloning Mini Mes as Doctor Evil did. But DNA was not heard of back in the early 19th century.He thinks they ought to combine there efforts and create a female back from the dead to be a mate for the Frankenstein monster. Who knows if the big guy gets a little something something at home, maybe he won't have quite such a bad attitude. When the monster after wreaking havoc again on the countryside is finally back in the Frankenstein laboratory, he insists on a 'friend' for himself. It's a real mess that Clive has gotten himself in again.Bride Of Frankenstein with that incredible climax when the monster tries to court his bride will still give you frights for weeks on watching it. The Gothic horror atmosphere that James Whale created on the Universal sets is still capable of creeping one out. Boris Karloff did not repeat his monster role after this and Colin Clive died in 1937 before the next Frankenstein film was made. Still the cycle may have been the most successful of all the Universal monster franchises. It certainly my favorite of all of them.",The Bride of Frankenstein
3,Leofwine_draca,Top-notch sequel is one of the most influential horrors ever,9,16 December 2015,"James Whale's sequel to the 1931 classic FRANKENSTEIN is considered by many to be superior to the original film, and some people think of it as the best horror film ever made. This is something that I don't agree with, for reasons I will come to. However although there are a handful of faults with the film, it is still a worthy sequel and one of the finest Universal classics.These include the various monster rampages - as good as ever - and of course the creation scene, which is even bigger and better than the original creation. Kites fly, electricity crackles, sparks rain down, and the Bride is raised up into the sky on rickety metal poles. It is certainly a spectacular moment in an exciting, action-packed film. However the most heartfelt and moving scene of the film is when the Monster visits and befriends a blind hermit. The hermit's kindness even causes the Monster to shed a tear, and the scenes where he learns speech are genuinely warming, but in the back of the mind we always know that this is going to come to an end, and soon it does, when hunter John Carradine (in an early bit part) comes in and starts shooting.The actors are great once more, and the cast list can hardly be bettered, with Colin Clive, back from the original FRANKENSTEIN, once more playing the tormented scientist, and gin-sipping Ernest Theisiger (THE OLD DARK HOUSE) as the truly evil creator this time around, his haggard features and slightly insane hair perfect for the role of the weird scientist. Valerie Hobson is a beautiful Elizabeth, and the one character who is totally good in the film. Dwight Frye is again on hand as a monstrous assistant who this time gets thrown off the battlements for his troubles after taunting the Monster with a burning torch (you thought he would have learnt from his previous encounter). Elsa Lanchester is effective in her dual role as Mary Shelley and the Bride itself, and the latter performance, although brief, is excellent. Boris Karloff conveys pathos brilliantly. However this time around he has been taught to speak and this invariably lessons some of the horrific impact he had the first time around, but being a sequel this was to be expected anyway.The only bad acting in the film comes from an old woman who acts as a comic interpreter, and this is the film's main weakness: the reliance on comedy instead of horror for entertainment. If I wanted to watch comedy, I would pop on a Laurel and Hardy film, but instead Whale includes lots of humorous narrative and events, mainly at the beginning of the film, and once again this really lessons what should have been an atmospheric build-up to the horror. However, in a film that has miniature people in jars, a singed Monster roaming woods and graveyards and an electrically-charged ending, you can't really go too far wrong. THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Whale's last horror film, is yet another Universal classic and a worthy sequel which develops nicely upon the original concept and remains hugely entertaining, even to this day. ""We belong dead!""",The Bride of Frankenstein
4,SnoopyStyle,second half is nothing less than horror icon,9,1 July 2015,"Mary Shelley tells Lord Byron that there is more to the story of Frankenstein's monster. Both Henry Frankenstein and his monster survive the fire of the original movie. Frankenstein disowns his research and his creation. His former mentor Doctor Septimus Pretorius returns to show him his living miniature creations. Meanwhile the Monster is hounded by hunters as he encounters various people. He befriends an old blind lonely man. He escapes from the hunters and run into Pretorius who has made a brain for the monster's companion. Frankenstein refuses to cooperate so Pretorius has his wife Elizabeth kidnapped. He reluctantly agrees to build a Bride for the Monster.The first half is nothing special and is mostly rebuilding this Frankenstein world. The living miniature are campy and cool. The first half is a B-movie. The acting is bad. Boris Karloff is good and he gets to say a few words in the last act. The second half is nothing less than a horror classic. For me, it starts with the old blind man. He gives the movie its heart. His relationship with the monster is absolutely touching. Then there is the climatic lab scene. There is no more iconic lines than ""She's Alive!"" Pardon the pun but that scene is electric. The look of the Bride is iconic. It goes down in history as one of the horror greats of all time.",The Bride of Frankenstein
5,Hitchcoc,The Monster is More True to Shelley's Vision,10,7 March 2006,"When Ernest Thesiger points and says, ""The bride of Frankenstein,"" rolling his r's, he creates one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. I do consider the second film superior to the first (though I love them both) because of the complexity of the characters and, more specifically, the monster. In Shelley's book the monster is lonely but articulate. He seeks out a bride. Frankenstein creates one but then destroys her, making his creature furious and vengeful. This monster actually has a kind part to him. For him to be blunt force thug can only go so far. It works in the first film but how much more growling and stomping could there be? The scenes of him wandering in the countryside, meeting the lonely old blind man in the house in the woods, and being shown kindness by him is very touching. The monster is allowed some humanity; some privacy. We know this can't last because his creator has doomed him. We often see Victor as some kind of hero, but, in reality, he has committed an incredible sin against another being. He wants a companion, but she turns on him and destroys his hope.The setup, with Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley, talking with the foremost romantic poets of the time, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron (who also rolls his r's), is a great lead in as she brags about writing a story that will make your skin crawl. She must have been something in that male dominated society. Of course, her mother was one of the first to demand rights for women. When she reappears as the Bride, it is awesome. And who came up with the hair. It is one of those things like the monster's neck bolts, that has become such an icon for our culture. These early Universal films deserve to be judged as major movies. Just because the subject is horror, doesn't mean they should be dismissed. James Whale was a great director with an amazing vision.",The Bride of Frankenstein
6,mark.waltz,"The monster gets a heart and a voice after escaping from ""The Wizard of Odd"".",10,31 May 2013,"There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to ""Frankenstein"" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of ""Frankenstein"", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale ""Young Frankenstein"" 40 years later.It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals ""Wait, there's more!"". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for ""The Devil Doll"" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen ""Young Frankenstein"" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that (""Wait! I was going to make espresso!"") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on ""Saturday Night Live"" singing ""I Feel Pretty"".John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and ""Sherlock Holmes"" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.",The Bride of Frankenstein
7,classicsoncall,"""What we need is a female victim of sudden death, can you do it?""",9,25 October 2006,"Four years after creating the iconic screen image of the Frankenstein Monster, Boris Karloff reprises his role in the James Whale directed sequel, ""Bride of Frankenstein"". Today's viewing was my first, and I was surprised with how little actual screen time the 'Bride' was actually present. But in those few moments, Elsa Lanchester is utterly incredible as the monster's 'mate', though the story never comes close to taking it that far.Colin Clive is even more maniacally inspired here than in the original ""Frankenstein"", perhaps buttressed by self confidence and complemented by the even more insane Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger). Dr. Henry's resolve to ""... have no more of this hell spawn"" is met with equal passion by Pretorius - ""To a new world of gods and monsters"". Admitting to the demonic nature of their enterprise, both men find themselves on a collision course with scientific destiny. I was particularly enthralled by Pretorius' first appearance on screen, oddly portending Max Von Sydow's guise as Father Merrin in 1973's ""The Exorcist"".Karloff's creature has matured over the four year time span, he's a lot faster and more nimble of foot, and he manages to speak intelligible words when prompted by the forest hermit (O.P. Heggie). I was delightfully amazed to learn how close Gene Hackman's portrayal in ""Young Frankenstein"" was based on Heggie's character.Even more inspired gadgetry is brought to bear on the original laboratory set, punctuated by the addition of the lightning rod kites. It all adds to the deranged scientific sensibility of the story, the reanimation of human life from the remains of the dead. It would of course be done time and again in film, but never as creatively or with such frenzied fervor.I probably owe it to myself to watch this one a few more times, as reading other reviews of the movie on this forum has been educational to say the least. Going in, I wouldn't have considered it to have a stronger reputation than the original ""Frankenstein"", with a higher placement in the IMDb rankings at the time of this posting. One thing is certain though, I could watch Elsa Lanchester's brief but mesmerizing portrayal of the 'Bride' over and over again.",The Bride of Frankenstein
8,gavin6942,A Great Universal Horror Sequel That Tops the Original,8,20 February 2011,"Doctor Frankenstein survives his fall from the windmill, and the monster escapes from burning inside. What is next? Thanks to a meeting between the monster and yet another mad scientist, the answer could be more monsters...I thought the Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) prologue is a nice touch, though Mike Mayo calls the introduction ""a particular embarrassment."" It really tied the film to the first one nicely, I felt, as it seems pretty clear that everyone died. This tied to keep the continuity clear.I like to call this one ""the broken leg movie"", because COlin Clive was filming with a broken leg, and Boris Karloff broke his leg during filming. These guys need to drink more milk! The bottle scene in the lab of Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) is bizarre and confusing, though a great use of technology for the 1930s. That, and several other famous scenes have made it to pop culture, including the blind hermit scene (made even more famous thanks to Mel Brooks) and even just the emergence of the Bride herself, considered a Universal monster in her own right.Howard Maxford calls this sequel ""an excellent blend of black humour and thrills"". Many have called this sequel superior to the original (though Mike Mayo dissents and calls it ""uneven""), and I agree. I felt the picture was tighter, looked sharper, and had a very good plot with some interesting moral angles. This truly was a ""new world of gods and monsters"".I would love to have seen the film as planned, with the additional murders and subplots. Apparently, there was even a ""planned shot of the Monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to 'rescue' the figure from the cross."" The Monster's strapping to a pole was kept, as well as Pretorius' subtle homosexuality.And lastly, as much as Karloff did not want the monster to talk, I think they made the right decision, as his limited speech makes him more human and therefore a character we can feel some sympathy for.",The Bride of Frankenstein
9,lee_eisenberg,sequel...good...pompous remakes...bad,10,8 August 2005,"""Bride of Frankenstein"" is one of those rarities: a sequel that actually ends up being worth something. It portrays that Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and The Monster (Boris Karloff) are still alive and still doing their stuff. The Monster continues unintentionally scaring people, while the doctor wants to marry hubby Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson), but quirky Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) gets him to create a mate for The Monster. In a career-defining role, Elsa Lanchester plays the title character (assuming that we refer to The Monster as Frankenstein).Admittedly, Universal's horror flicks from the '30s weren't really horror flicks; they were kinda silly. But, this one did actually go so far as to humanize The Monster: they let him speak while he was with the blind man. Oh, and in case any of us were wondering whence the James Whale biopic ""Gods and Monsters"" got its name, we learn.",The Bride of Frankenstein
10,jboothmillard,Bride of Frankenstein,10,13 March 2009,"Director James Whale returned four years later with this follow up to the adaptation of the famous Mary Shelley story. Basically, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) reveals to Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton) and Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) the events of the previous film. The Doctor, now Baron Henry Von Frankenstein (Colin Clive), nor his Monster (Boris Karloff) died, Henry survived the fall from the windmill, and the Monster went into the water beneath. Henry wants nothing more than to relax with new wife Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson), but former mentor, sinister Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) shows up wanting him to help create life again, he even shows him some miniature people he created to convince him, but Henry refuses. His Monster meanwhile saves a girl from drowning, and is captured momentarily, being placed in the pose of Jesus Christ in put in a dungeon, but he manages to escape again. Then he forms a friendship with a blind Hermit (O.P. Heggie) who looks after him, feeds him, and teaches him to talk, before hunters chase him away. Then the Monster shows up to see Pretorius, and he thinks that Frankenstein's creation can be very useful to help him with his plan. The Monster kidnaps Elizabeth, and Pretorius blackmails Henry to help him build a friend/mate, i.e. a woman, a female creature, or a bride. So the same methods to bring the creation to life are used, electrodes and a storm (lightning), but with a recently removed heart and artificially made brain. The experiment is successful, and the Monster's Mate (Lancaster again) looks around in wonder, and then Frankenstein's Monster enters excitedly and reaches to touch her, but she screams in terror and rejection, he knows she hates him. Elizabeth has got away to get Henry, the Monster tells them to go and live, while he tells Pretorious they belong dead and pulls the lever to destroy the laboratory and tower. Karloff is still very engaging as the Monster, especially after learning to speak, Thesiger gives an ingenious portrayal of the perverse Professor, and the image of Monster's Mate, with that bizarre electric hairdo, is just as iconic as Karloff. The original is a fantastic, creepy influential horror classic, this sequel in my opinion is much more brilliant, with a more effective story, and more dark and poignant moments to enjoy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. It was number 97 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",The Bride of Frankenstein
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Here She Comes, There She Goes",6,19 November 2005,"This is a pretty solid movie, one of the few old-time horror films that still stands up to today's standards. The cinematography is excellent with many fascinating shadow-like shots, particularly with facial closeups.A surprise is that the actual ""bride"" of Frankenstein is only created and then seen in the final minutes of the film. The title can be misleading as we expect most of the story to be about her. Instead, most of the movie is simply a sequel to the original Frankenstein, picking up where that film left off with the monster somehow surviving his fiery doom.I would like to have seen more of the ""bride,"" who was fascinating to view. Elsa Lanchester, who played that character, also played Mary Shelley in the beginning of the film. The most interesting character, I thought, was the devil-like Dr. Praetorious, played by Ernest Thesiger. Now this guy had a true face of a ""mad scientist!""Most films need to be trimmed 10-15 minutes but here is an exception. This movie needed another 10 to 15 minutes tacked on, so we could see more of the ""bride."" It's still considered one of the best horror films of all time and, at just 74 minutes, would certainly be worth your time to check it out if you've seen it.",The Bride of Frankenstein
12,rmax304823,Get beck! Get BECK!,7,6 February 2013,"It's easy to see why this sequel to ""Frankenstein,"" in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing.In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fiancée and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it.But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein,"" in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys.Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, ""It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!"" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. Movie buffs can amuse themselves by looking for Walter Brennan and Helen Walker in bit parts.I've sort of made fun of the movie but it's become, not a classic, but a totem, part of our vernacular culture. If you haven't seen it, it's certainly worth watching.",The Bride of Frankenstein
13,ma-cortes,First rate and awesome sequel as good as the original Frankestein,8,10 January 2010,"This sensational sequel deals about the Dr. Frankestein (Colin Clive), and the Dr. Pretorius (a sinister Ernest Thesiger) who are coerced by the monster (Boris Karloff) into creating a bride (Elsa Lanchaster in a double role also as the novel's author, Mary Shelley) for him.The classic actor of horror movies named Boris Karloff is magnificent and Colin Clive brings a strong portrayal of the scientific attempting to create a new monster changing hearts . Atmospheric, slick terror film , creaky at times but it's still impressive. The film displays excellent set design , ambitious screenplay with too many eerie scenes and adequate interpretation for all casting. Boris Karloff does a top notch performance in the role which made him a terror movie legend,it still stands as one of the great screen acting. Dwight Frye also is excellent in a similar role to Igor in a brief performance. Furthermore in role very secondary appears E.E. Clive as burgomaster and John Carradine as a hunter at the hermit's cottage. Special mention to Una O'Connor as sympathetic servant and of course Ernest Thesigher as mean scientific creator of homunculus. Appropriate musical score by Franz Waxman and dark black and white cinematography full of lights and shades by Mescall. It's followed by ¨House of Frankestein¨, ¨son of Frankestein¨, ¨Frankestein meet the wolf man¨ and ¨ The Zingara and the monsters¨ in which as the title suggests, various of Universal's most famous monsters confront and fight among them . The motion picture is masterfully produced and directed by James Whale who already directed his former classic horror film, ¨Frankestein¨. Rating : Top-drawer terror film, essential and indispensable watching.",The Bride of Frankenstein
14,BA_Harrison,"Tall, well built M, rugged looks, GSOH, enjoys wine, cigars and music seeks attractive, wild-haired F for friendship and romance.",7,8 May 2010,"This distinctive work from visionary director James Whale boldly combines chilling scenes of the macabre with crazy black humour, outrageous scientific cods-wallop, and even a few wry swipes at religion—quite an achievement for a film hailing from a major studio during an era when censorship was rife; but even though it has many admirable points—its unique style, impressive lighting, excellent acting, stunning production design, iconic creature make-up, and a memorable score—I just can't find myself in complete agreement with the majority of critics, who consider it to not only be one of the best sequels in the history of cinema, but also one of the finest examples of the horror genre ever. It's good, but it's not THAT good!As far as I am concerned, Whale's darkly comedic approach to the film is often detrimental to the film's overall power, serving to weaken the horror (whilst also grating on my nerves quite a bit); the oft-mentioned 'hermit scene' fails to tug at my heartstrings as intended, being way too heavy handed (warning: on no account watch Young Frankenstein beforehand), and the bride herself only makes an appearance towards the close of the film, shortly before disappearing in a pile of rubble in a very silly and rushed ending (the pull of a single lever triggers the destruction of the watchtower; hadn't the Baron considered having the damn thing disconnected?).Other factors that I feel prevent the film from being the epitome of horror perfection are the tiny people in jars, who are just too fantastical for the genre (they'd be better suited to a fairytale than a classic monster movie), and Una O'Connor's supposedly funny but cringe-inducing performance as Minnie the house-maid. On the more positive side, the rest of the cast are wonderful: Karloff once again puts in a strong, emotive performance as the monster, Elsa Lanchester is beguiling as both Mary Shelley and the Bride, Valerie Hobson is stunning as Elizabeth, and creepy Ernest Thesiger is great as the real villain of the piece, the Mephistopheles-like Doctor Pretorius.Perhaps, with repeat viewings, I may become accustomed to Bride of Frankenstein's oddball approach, and learn to love it more, but watching it so soon after the brilliant original, the change in style was just too much for me to take in. I'll rate it a 7/10—a visually impressive, daring, but flawed movie.",The Bride of Frankenstein
15,moonspinner55,Portions of it are surprisingly stilted...,4,5 September 2006,"Dr. Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff), thought dead at the end of 1931's ""Frankenstein"", rises from the ashes and creates more havoc in a tiny hamlet; meanwhile, the shady doctor prepares to supply the gentle giant with a mate. Handsome, but extremely somber film won't please anyone looking for a good old-fashioned screamer. Karloff certainly shouldn't be missed in this signature role but, while film buffs rave about the picture's Gothic look and campy finale, they frequently overlook the flimsy script and director James Whale's uncertain handling. Elsa Lanchester appears as both the bride and as author Mary Shelley in the movie's achingly wooden prologue. ** from ****",The Bride of Frankenstein
16,Quinoa1984,"funny, dramatic, endearing, frightening, atmospheric, romantic, and even existential!",10,24 October 2012,"Bride of the Frankenstein has got it all, seemingly, in a tight 75 minutes. It is even, dare I say it (and I will), superior to Whale's original 1931 film, possibly because he didn't have his usual producer, Carl Laemmle, breathing down his neck. He could do whatever he wanted, and here he decided to start the film with what is, at least to me, almost something post-modern (and this before modernism, or during it!) where the Shellys, Percy and Mary, talk with Lord Byron about the Frankenstein story, ruminating on what happens in the original story (accompanied by film clips, and while this takes place technically 90 years after the Shellys/Byron lived, pay it no mind), and then Mary takes a bit of a leap: what comes after, and more specifically, what about if that Monster lived and didn't die in that windmill fire? Eh, eh? This film also carries the distinction of being funnier and fresher than the original film, in part because Whale had to realize some of this stuff was silly, and even surreal; when the other, much-more-mad-thank- Frankenstein doctor Pretorius (the unforgettable Ernest Thesiger playing this role with full-tile scene-chewery in the best way) shows off his 'creations' as little people he has grown ""like plants"" in little jars, you know that this won't be really much like the first film. And yet, it is in some ways still a movie about a big Monster going about without control... and yet learning a bit more control, but unfortunately at the lead of a mad Doc like Pretorius, who promises the big galut something much more tangible and, frankly, emotional than what he's had in his limited time as the un-dead: a woman 'friend', a ""Bride"" all his own. Hey, if forced marriage worked for thousands of years before, why not with ""Good-Bad"" man?The script is full of some good zingers, like ""Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be much more amusing if we were all devils, no nonsense about angels and being good."" And there are moments where real pathos does come in, and the idea of the Monster being humanized is brought even more to the forefront than in the (great) scene of the Monster and the girl by the lake in the first film; when the Monster stumbles upon a cabin in the woods where a blind man plays violin and draws him in because of it (and because he can't see) we get one of the most poignant, simple couple of scenes in any horror film. There's some humor, but it's mostly about what can happen when one isn't immediately ""AAAH!"" in front of the Monster, which only goes to agitate and get the Monster to attack more, and there is an attempt at civility, respect, and knowledge, even about something like bread as food and smoking (also ""Good"" and look at Karloff's face, what a happy camper).The atmosphere, especially in the climactic tower scenes, is rich with the dark and gloom, but it's surprising how much light the film is, a lot of it in the day, and even a scene where the Monster breaks out of jail isn't quite as scary because of it. Whale does know that some of this is blatantly silly, and that's more than fine. In a way his direction, as well as Karloff's performance and other things like Una O'Connor as the (also) unforgettable housekeeper who comes into a room and with only a line or two steals the rug out from all the other actors, is ahead of its time. I think even something like the evil doctor's plan and the ""collaboration"" with Frankenstein to make this Bride is so clever as to have its own logic outside of horror. Bride of Frankenstein will work as something to chill and entertain the kids, or the adults, but there's other layers to it that I hope to return to in years ahead.""We belong DEAD!""",The Bride of Frankenstein
17,JohnHowardReid,A bride by any other name,9,21 November 2006,"Many people regard Bride of Frankenstein as the best horror film ever made. I wouldn't go that far. I much prefer Frankenstein. Despite a lot of wonderful set pieces, the original film has more. The pacing of the 1931 movie is faster too. And I like the crotchety baron's comic relief. On the other hand, this entry has several demerits, including Una O'Connor and Gavin Gordon. In fact, Bride is burdened with an appallingly bad opening scene all around. Chief problem is the hammy Gavin Gordon who gives a such a florid impression of Lord Byron, he soon has many viewers squirming in agony. Elsa Lanchester and Douglas Walton are also infected by this ripest of hams, but once this atrocious Prologue is over and the movie itself starts, we are handed over to the real stars: Karloff in his prime and Ernest Thesiger in his green years. Colin Clive, playing straight man to Thesiger, is more subdued than in the original, while Valerie Hobson (replacing Mae Clarke) has hardly any footage at all and is continuously upstaged by that grand dame of a screaming nuisance, Una O'Connor. I can't stand her at the best of times and in this movie she seems almost constantly underfoot.Karloff, however, is superb. Hampered, disguised and disfigured by his lumbering make-up, he manages to make his Monster both repulsive yet sympathetic, impossibly nightmarish yet totally believable. Providing him with a few bits of dialogue was a masterly touch. And of course the scene he shares with O.P. Heggie provides one of the greatest moments in cinema history.Whale's stylishly atmospheric direction makes the most of both the luxuriously ornate and the expressionistically grotesque sets. The cinematic wizardry of the special effects never fails to draw gasps of astonishment even from the more blasé and sophisticated viewers of 2007.And title notwithstanding, the role of the ""bride"" is actually quite small. Nonetheless, all the lead up action provides a great treat for fans of the macabre and the wittily grotesque.",The Bride of Frankenstein
18,wes-connors,Love at First Fright,10,21 May 2013,"On a dark and stormy night, original ""Frankenstein"" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie ""Frankenstein"" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her ""Bride of Frankenstein""...Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem...There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an ""Oscar"" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were ""Best Supporting Actor"" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the ""Bride of Frankenstein"" on one of them.********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester",The Bride of Frankenstein
19,Coventry,Is it possible to improve on perfection ??,10,19 August 2003,"When I first saw Frankenstein (1931), I was amazed. It was one of the greatest stories I ever saw and it impressed me on so many levels. I honestly didn't think I would ever see such a great phenomenon again. Well, I should reconsider that. The sequel is even more magical, more impressive and more perfect. The bride of Frankenstein can easily be considered as the best horror movie ever made and it even ranks high it the list of best movies in general ever made. The atmosphere, the locations, the acting and direction...really nothing at all can be criticized. Compared to what everybody thought, both the Monster and Dr. Frankenstein survived the incident at the windmill at the end of the original Frankenstein. While the Monster flees to freedom, Dr. Frankenstein is approached by Dr. Pretorius. A wicked scientist who created life himself, but he needs the genius of Dr. Frankenstein to complete his project. Although he swore to his girl Elizabeth he would stop playing God, Frankenstein is intrigued by the the project of Dr. Pretorius and joins his research. Meanwhile, the Monster is feeling terrible. He realizes he scares everybody away and only found friendship with a blind man. During this absolutely beautiful and magical scene he learns to talk and express his emotions. When he's hunted down again he meets Dr. Pretorius and demands him to make him a friend. Because of this, Dr. Pretorius can force Frankenstein to create life again. If he doesn't, Elizabeth shall die... This movie gives a completely other meaning to the word ""sequel"". When this word is heard, people usually think about an inferior product which was made to make more money. This certainly isn't the case for The Bride of Frankenstein. Hard to believe, but this movie, in fact, ADDS a lot of great things to the saga of Frankenstein. It handles even more about the human emotions and contains some very important lessons. We also see a lot more about the personalities of the characters. The Monster of course, but also Dr. Frankenstein and his girl. And a few great new characters are introduced. The blind man to begin with...An adorable man who is as lonely as the creature. He doesn't judge on what he sees ( well, he can't of course ) and searches for deeper feelings. The character of Dr. Pretorius is fantastic also. A wicked and obsessed man, who doesn't care about normal life. He's rude and emotionless and terrific as the bad guy in the story.The story opens with Mary Shelley telling the complete story. This immediately sets the perfect atmosphere which is held during the whole movie. No doubt about this...one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, do whatever it takes to get a copy !!! I gave the original Frankenstein a rating 10 out of 10, so I guess there isn't a rating that is high enough to praise The Bride of Frankenstein. Just as good as cinema can get !!!",The Bride of Frankenstein

21,Theo Robertson,Impressive Though Over Analyzed Horror Movie,8,15 January 2010,"One problem with film criticism is to over analysis a film and read things in to its subtext which just aren't there . THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a very good example of this . Once someone points out the fact that director James Whale was a homosexual it opens the floodgates for people reading the film in a way no one originally envisaged . We're shown an opening scene where Lord Byron describes himself as "" England's greatest sinner "" and as the film progresses we're introduced to nods and winks to a sin of that dare not be explicitly referred to . Instead we see Doctor Pretoruis , a sort of precursor to Quintan Crisp who is described as "" queer looking "" drinks gin , makes a queen and suggests that he becomes a partner of Baron Frankenstein . Oh purleese . Do you honestly think Whale made this film as a type of gay manifesto ? I'll say one thing about movie directors and that is they have kept a lot of pretentious pseudo intellectuals in a job As a form of entertainment ( Yes films are produced as a form of entertainment and to make money for studio investments ) THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is very impressive . There is an irony showing the character of Mary Shelley because our thoughts of FRANKENSTEIN owe more to James Whale and Universal studios than they do to Shelley . I doubt if very many people have read the original text but we're all aware of the image of Boris Karloff staggering around a studio interior forest growling . The studio forest depicted in this film are obviously stage sets but are very impressive What Whale has done is to mix pathos with a grotesque sense of humour . I thought after seeing YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN I could never take the scene of the monster turning up at the blind hermit's cottage seriously ever again but after seen the movie it remains a touching , poignant segment of the film and Karloff elicits great sympathy from the audience . There's also a surreal image of Doctor Pretorious feasting in a crypt and while there's absolutely no logic for this scene ( Unless he is clairvoyant and knew the monster was going to turn up ) it remains a striking and morbid image James Whale directs at a very good and brisk pace and with his "" midget people "" he brings a sense of wonder that would have had audiences gasping "" How did he do that ? "" but I don't think it's his masterwork , that would almost certainly THE INVISIBLE MAN from two years earlier , a film slightly more enjoyable due to its insane , dark humour along with jaw dropping special effects . The narrative itself is rather episodic and plot less and the mix of different accents grate slightly with Una O' Connor playing an irritating comic character but it's still an impressive film though over the year's has become over analyzed by people who should know better",The Bride of Frankenstein
22,Doylenf,"Quality sequel is visually even more stunning than ""Frankenstein""...",7,3 November 2006,"Even better than the original.Add to the quality of FRANKENSTEIN some even better visuals (German expressionism again in the sets), the grander look and concept of the whole story with the monster humanized in a believable way, and the music of Franz Waxman which highlights all of the most dramatic moments, especially the creation of The Bride--and you have a film even more satisfying than the original.COLIN CLIVE is implored by ERNEST THESIGER to help him make a mate for the monster. Eventually, a memorable scene with the Bride being unveiled (it turns out to be ELSA LANCHESTER who can scream with the best of them), has her seeing her mate for the first time and gazing at him with wide-eyed fright as she lets out a piercing scream. It's just one of many comical and whimsical moments in the whole film.VALERIE HOBSON is Clive's frightened sweetheart, and UNA O'CONNOR (another screamer), DWIGHT FRYE and JOHN CARRADINE round out the supporting cast with style.BORIS KARLOFF repeats his famous role, even more engaging this time as he seems significantly brighter in the range of things he's given to do, such as the famous woodland scene interacting with a blind man in a cottage, both of them enjoying a new friendship. This scene, especially, will remind you of Mel Brooks' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, but it's played here more as a tender interlude rather than comedy.Totally absorbing with great looking sets and atmosphere, heightened by a Franz Waxman score worth listening to. Fans of the original should love this one.",The Bride of Frankenstein
23,preppy-3,A classic--but not scary,10,22 February 2004,"Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and mad Dr. Petorious (Ernest Thesiger) team up to make a mate for the monster.That's all you need to know really.  This sequel to the 1931 ""Frankenstein"" is even better than the original!  This one has a bigger budget (check out the enormous sets), some VERY elaborate costumes (check out what Valerie Hobson is wearing in her first appearance), a script that moves like lightning and every cast member giving their all.Karloff appears again as the monster and he's fantastic--you can see he isn't evil at all, just misunderstood.  His attempts to make contact with people--and the violence he's greeted with--are heartbreaking.  And there's a mock crucifiction sequence which must have been hell for Karloff.  Clive is just OK as Frankenstein.  Hobson is gorgeous and very good as his bride Elizabeth--she only has a few scenes but she makes them count. Thesiger is WAY over the top (and just great) as Petorious--he has some REALLY strange lines but he pulls them off.  Una O'Connor as Minnie (the maid) is shrill--but funny.  And Elsa Lanchester is unforgettable as Mary Shelley and the bride.  Her appearance has been copied and parodied endlessly--and she's just great.  The script has one classic line after another and many sequences have become folklore--like the monsters meeting with the blind hermit (parodied hysterically in ""Young Frankenstein""), the creation sequence and the closing. Great direction by James Whale and a beautiful music score.  My only real complaint--would any scientist, however mad, have a lever that would blow apart his whole castle?Now--it is NOT scary.  In 1935 this was strong stuff but it's VERY tame today.  Still, this is a fast-moving, very entertaining movie--definetely a prime example of the Universal monster movies of the 1930s.  It works more as a comedy today than anything else.  A perfect example of the kind of film ""they don't make anymore"".Look for John Carradine in a very small unbilled role as a hunter.",The Bride of Frankenstein
24,LeonLouisRicci,"""We belong dead!""",10,18 May 2012,"Sardonic coupling of Dark Humor and Horror. An incredible Work by a Cinema Master, Director James Whale. Much to admire here, not the least of which is a beautiful Musical Score by Frank Waxman and Karloff's touching, Sympathetic Portrayal. Adding to the bizarre emphasis to this great Film is Elsa Lanchester's Bride with Iconic Makeup and Wedding Dress, Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, and Dwight Fry as Karl.This the best of the Universal Studio's 15 years of Horror Monster Movies. Ideally should be viewed as a Double Feature with...Frankenstein (1931)... that establishes the Characters, Setting, and Style, that gave birth to the Mythological Template that would endure to this Day.Note...A very interesting Biographical Movie about James Whale, the Director, was made in 1998 titled...Gods and Monsters...Ian Mclellan won a Best Actor Oscar for his touching and poignant portrayal.",The Bride of Frankenstein

When he meets up with Baron Frankenstein's original monster they set about coercing the reluctant Baron to create a wife for the lonely Boris Karloff. This is a cracking tale of science fiction, horror and even romance as the monster ends up endowed with far more ""humanity"" than either scientist. Una O'Connor and Elsa Lanchester are both great too, though feature sparingly. The special effects stand better scrutiny than many a sci-film being made twenty years later and the cannibalised classical musical score brings tension, joy, love and despair a-plenty to compensate for, admittedly a rather stilted script.

26,poolandrews,"""He's a nightmare in the daylight he is."" Great film.",8,25 August 2006,"Bride of Frankenstein starts as author Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) that informs her guests that mad scientist Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) & his man made monster (Boris Karloff) in fact survive the angry villagers at the end of her last novel... However she goes on to tell the story of the sequel & how the monster roams around the countryside looking for acceptance & murdering a few people while Frankenstein is contacted by one of his old university teachers Dr. Pretorious (Ernest Thesiger) who says that he can 'grow' a brain & needs Dr. Frankenstein's help to build a body to put it in & re animate it, at first Dr. Frankenstein refuses to have anything to do with it but when Pretorius uses his original creation to kidnap his wife Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) Frankenstein has no choice but to go along with Pretorious's plans...Directed by James Whale & a direct sequel to his original Frankenstein (1935) Bride of Frankenstein is a great film by anyones standards & is still extremely watchable & effective even today over 70 years since it was made. The script by William Hurlbut (although there are a further 7 writers credited on the IMDb with the 'adaptaion') moves along at a nice pace & is never boring or dull & it has a good story that both entertains & engages. The film works on many levels, as a dark comedy, as a tragic love story, as a horror, as a sci-fi & drama. The film manages to get the audience to sympathise with the monster one moment while just as quickly it can turn the monster back into the villain, I was never quite sure what to feel about him. The film is populated by character's that are likable & you more often than not end up caring about them which is a hard thing to achieve in a film such as this.Director Whale does a terrific job & the film simply oozes atmosphere, the stone castle, the almost art-deco style old fashioned lab equipment, the quaint European village setting, the imposing prison cell with the huge chair & steel chains, a spooky graveyard complete with cobweb strewn underground tombs & the simple but effective woodland sets. The black and white cinematography (don't touch the colourised version) is simple yet very effective. Frankenstein's monster is the stereotypical huge flat headed man with a bolt through his neck but Karloff had the role down to a tee & him in Jack Pierce's make-up is a truly classic & iconic image from horror cinema. The Bride's appearance is also a classic image & is more or less perfect. Apparently the film originally ran nearer 90 minutes but the producers cut 15 or so minutes out & the footage is now thought to be lost, I wonder if it would have made the film any better & to be honest I don't think it would have as it might have slowed things down a bit.Apparently shot in 46 days for little under $400,000 on the back-lot at Universal studios Bride of Frankenstein is a well made film, it has great production values, impressive (for the time) special effects & good acting.Bride of Frankenstein is a classic of the genre & just a great piece of film-making, it's as simple & straight forward as that.

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly wrote ""Frankenstein"" the novel back in 1816. During the prologue, she continues the saga.

28,Boba_Fett1138,Horror with depth.,10,3 July 2005,"This movie is absolutely beautiful! The story is highly original (especially considering that this is a sequel) and extremely well executed. I'm not sure if its fair to call it better than its predecessor ""Frankenstein"", since the both are hard to compare in my opinion. They are different of each other in quite some ways but both of them are brilliant in their own way.Karloff most definitely seems more at ease in his role this time and he's not overacting anymore. He plays the monster with some real passion and eye for detail. His make-up also looks better than ever. Still I think it's a bit of a shame that so many actors from the original ""Frankenstein"" didn't reprise their role in this movie. Lot's of the characters are played by different actors this time. But I'm surely glad that Colin Clive returned as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. I already really loved him in ""Frankenstein"" and I enjoyed him once more in this movie. An underrated actor that died too young.The emotions are once more very real and extremely powerful. The scene were the monster makes friendship with the blind man is unforgettable and truly a powerful sequence.

29,kevinolzak,First seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in 1965,9,16 May 2019,"Many consider 1935's ""Bride of Frankenstein"" to be one of those rare instances in which the sequel proved to be better than the original 1931 ""Frankenstein,"" and it certainly took Boris Karloff's Monster as far as he could go as the star, now granted the power of speech and the knowledge of how he came to be: ""I love dead, hate living."" By far director James Whale's most brilliant decision was to cast the same actress as both Mary Shelley in the prologue and the Bride for the climax, selecting Else Lanchester, actual bride of actor Charles Laughton, and she was delighted: ""I do have a rather unusual face!"" We begin with a charming sequence depicting a roaring fire around which Mary regales her poet husband Shelley (Douglas Walton) and the erudite Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), England's exulted 'greatest sinner,' with the further adventures of The Monster, who managed to escape the ravages of the fiery windmill by falling into the waters beneath (Jack Pierce's modified makeup design revealing the clamps around the top of his skull). Wet, tired, and just a bit peeved, The Monster takes his anger out on the parents of 'Little Maria' (she drowned at his hands in the original) before wandering off into the night, as the dying Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive back again) is returned home to his waiting bride Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson). It is quickly established that Henry makes a sudden recovery, that his elderly father has expired (making him the new Baron), and that the unexpected arrival of his former mentor Dr. Septimus Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger, replacing Claude Rains) proves that another scientist possesses knowledge of the creation of life, and wishes to collaborate on a new venture. This Monster may have the strength of ten men but he can still be hurt by a bullet, encounters with rampaging villagers leaving him weary and defeated, until the soft sounds of a violin pierce the night air, offering comfort to his lonely existence. A cabin deep in the woods is the home of a blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) who senses a troubled soul in torment and provides shelter and sustenance to his beleaguered new friend. Whale may have been a confirmed atheist but it's still a touching scene, the hermit thanking the Lord for sending him one similarly afflicted, a tear streaming down The Monster's face as the screen fades to black. In next to no time, Frankenstein's creation has learned a vocabulary of simple terms, things that bring him newfound joy: bread, drink, smoke, wood (he still understandably fears fire). Unfortunately, this idyllic interlude is short lived as two hunters (John Carradine and Frank Terry) decide to 'rescue' the old blind man from the inhuman Monster: ""Frankenstein made him out of dead bodies!"" Another damaging fire, another friend permanently lost, is it any wonder the poor creature loses all semblance of compassion, until meeting Dr. Pretorius in the crypt of a teenage girl, planting the suggestion that a mate will be the answer to eternal solitude. With Dwight Frye's Karl Glutz aboard as dutiful grave robber (""this is no life for murderers!"") Whale proceeds to the most expansive creation scene of the 30s, Kenneth Strickfaden's electrical gadgets back in place, the old watchtower set from ""Frankenstein"" more imposing than before. Elsa's Bride is truly a beautiful sight to rhapsodize about, her own hair carefully coiffed with a white streak, each scar lovingly crafted by Jack Pierce into a wondrous whole, obviously enchanted by her creator as she follows him and reaches out to his entreaties. It's only when The Monster tries to befriend her that she reacts with abject horror, a multitude of screams followed by a knowing hiss once he determines that ""we belong dead."" The Monster's heartbreak is achingly real, another masterful performance of body language saying so much without (many) lines, though Boris himself still preferred his 1931 version over this one (he went from ? in 1931 to just 'Karloff' here, even with a fractured hip). As the Bride Elsa Lanchester became a legend in just the last five minutes of the film, very bird-like in her jerky sudden movements, her evil hiss suitably inspired by a protective mother swan. An unsolved mystery is why the Bride, supposedly the new, improved, deluxe model, doesn't survive the explosive finale like her intended does, in fact rendered speechless in the next entry ""Son of Frankenstein."" Watch for future Oscar winner Walter Brennan in the scene where all the neighbors gather in the home of Frau Neumann (he's the one holding a hatchet, with one line: ""poor old Neumann!"").",The Bride of Frankenstein

Its poignancy and artistry have lasted despite its attempts at being a throw-away monster movie. ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" however, feels like a movie setting out to become a high-camp classic, and it's to Whale's credit that it succeeds.If you don't live under a rock, the image of Elsa Lanchester, with her tower of black hair sticking straight up off of her head with a white lightning bolt zig-zagging down the sides, has to be familiar to you, even if you've never seen the movie. Her appearance in this was destined to be cloned by millions of Halloween costume-party goers for years afterwards. The hilarious romance between her and the monster takes center stage in this film, and Lanchester is a hoot as a hot-tempered woman impatient with her ""primitive"" male. It's the most unusual role Lanchester ever had. She normally played in supporting roles, usually as a demure maid or housekeeper. Here she vamps it up and manages to be surprisingly sexy for a woman newly created from dead people's body parts.If you're in the mood for a double feature, let ""Frankenstein"" make you sad and then let ""Bride of Frankenstein"" put a smile back on your face.Grade: A-",The Bride of Frankenstein

Una O'Connor is a scream as Minnie, the old biddy who is screeching to see the Monster killed, then shrieks when she spots the Monster. She is told to shut up at least five times in the film. Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius is a great mix of horror and humor; he robs graves, and also swigs gin out of laboratory beakers, has supper on top of a coffin, gets the Monster to have cigars with him.

33,Uriah43,A Pretty Good Classic Horror Film,9,27 January 2013,"After a brief sidelight involving an actress (Elsa Lanchester) performing as the original author (Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley) and two other guests, our story essentially starts off where the first film ends with the monster (played by Boris Karloff) surviving the fire by escaping into a well underneath the windmill. As he wanders around the countryside hungry and wounded, he stumbles upon a small cottage occupied by a blind hermit who, not knowing who he is, happily takes care of him. It's at this point that the monster begins to learn rudimentary speech. Meanwhile, a new character by the name of ""Dr. Pretorius"" (Ernest Thesiger) is introduced who seeks out ""Dr. Frankenstein"" (Colin Clive) to implore him to continue his research with the thought of introducing some improvements in order to create a mate for the monster. At any rate, rather than detailing the entire story I will just add that this film is thought by many critics to be even better than the original. And in some ways it is as it has more humor and better characters. Additionally, the film quality was better than the previous grainy version used in the first movie as well.

Valerie Hobson plays Henry's bride Elizabeth who is abducted and used as bait to force Henry to create the monster's bride. Elsa Lanchester steals scenes briefly as the Bride whose response to Frankenstein is the same as everyone else. Title is flawed within its brief footage of the Bride who is barely part of the film. While it lacks the shock of the first film due to its corniness, it is a worthy followup, bride's hair style and all. Score: 7 / 10",The Bride of Frankenstein
35,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Great follow-up to a classic,10,5 October 2016,"Having survived the fire, the creature's quest for companionship drives him into the arms of another mad doctor who has plans on recreating another creature to be it's mate and tries to get his creator on board to doing it and giving him his desires.This here was quite the exceptional sequel with so much to really like here. Much like the original, there's quite a lot of work here involving how to interact with the concepts of life and death, which here is reversed into being more about life against the original which focused on death. The idea of not only moving on from the previous experiments for the life together and how he gets roped through his insecurities by the friend who gets to him through his experiments in the glass-jars which is a great scene overall and their debates trying to get him onboard later on showcase that thread incredibly well. As well, the central scene in the hermit's cottage where we finally learn that the monster is able to show compassion and friendship is a crucial part of this thread as it shows a sense of humanity to the creature that never really showed it before where not only does the show of compassion to it give it a joy that wasn't there before which really highlights this factor. While this here is quite fun enough as it is, the fact that there's such a plentiful amount of action here that gives this one such a fantastic pace as there's the absolutely spectacular opening that not only follows through on fixing the ending from the other film while generating the proper action to start this one nicely, the following chase through the woods gives this plenty of great shots showing the villagers forcing him through the area is really exciting as the halting chases are utterly enjoyable as he escapes several times leading to even more brawls and chasing, and the film's main centerpiece sequence with the encounter with the Bride at the finale. There's so much to really love with the intensity of the creature coming back to life matching the original and it lifting off the table elicits the same eerie chills, and with it again playing into the life and death there's absolutely crazy finale in the castle tower which is the explosive, frenzied spectacle of the whole place coming and burying everything inside which is rather fun. Alongside the fine monster makeup for both creatures, these here are what make this one hold up incredibly well. There's only one flaw here, which is that the Bride comes into play so late in the film and doesn't really do much that it seems almost like an afterthought as there's so little screen time that it doesn't have much to do beyond its appearance. This here is what really holds it back.Today's Rating/PG: Violence.",The Bride of Frankenstein
36,AaronCapenBanner,Superior Sequel.,9,23 October 2013,"James Whale returned to direct this masterful sequel, beginning with a clever prologue with Author Mary Shelley(played by Elsa Lanchester) relating the events of the first film, but then insisting that the story isn't yet over, going on to describe the plot of Part II, picking up moments after the end of Part I, with the injured Henry Frankenstein(played again by Colin Clive) being brought to his(now late) father's castle, where he has assumed the Baron title. He is visited by Dr. Pretoreus,(played by Ernest Thesinger) who is a disgraced former teacher of his, who wants Henry to help him create a new monster, who will become his ""bride""(also played by Elsa Lanchester) The monster(again played superbly by Boris Karloff) has survived the fire, and after being chased by villagers(and a heartfelt interlude with a blind hermit) is befriended by Pretorious, who uses him to kidnap Elizabeth(now played by Valerie Hobson) to force Henry to help him, leading to a memorable and explosive finale.Brilliant sequel is even better, with a wonderful sense of humor balancing the horror, with inspired direction, writing, and performances from the whole cast. Unforgettable film filled with iconic imagery. Not to be missed, and a perfect double feature with the first.",The Bride of Frankenstein
37,The_Void,Awesome in every respect,8,5 October 2005,"From the glorious start all the way down to the frenzied climax, James Whale's sequel to his huge hit 'Frankenstein' delivers the goods and more than deserves the status it's earned as one of the greatest films ever made. In classic sequel style, Whale has taken everything that made the first film a success and added to it. The introduction to the film is the prime example of this, with Frankenstein writer Mary Shelly and two friends discussing her work. This scene sets the perfect atmosphere for the film, while also determining that what you're about to see isn't going to be exactly serious. This sequel is much more tongue-in-cheek than the first film, and the audacious idea of having the storywriter herself in the film aptly shows this. The scene also appears to be surprised to the fact that such a macabre tale could be written by a woman - but who wrote it isn't important. The story is fabulous, and Bride of Frankenstein has the advantage of telling the side of the story that not everyone knows. We pick up immediately after the events of the first film, with Frankenstein and his monster in the burning barn. Both escape unharmed, but it's not the end for Dr Frankenstein - even madder scientist, Dr Pretorius, has other ideas for the rest of his career...The story of Frankenstein is very macabre - what with grave robbing and bringing the dead back to life, and James Whale is always keen to capitalise on this. The whole film looks dark and sinister, and the locations that Whale films in reflects this brilliantly. The themes in the story mostly concern the ills of man playing god, and this is very well done as the themes are always prevalent - even the monster itself knows it shouldn't exist! Boris Karloff steps back effortlessly into the role that made him famous, and once again delivers a first rate exhibition of acting. Karloff has proved time and time again that he can handle all sorts of different roles, and this is definitely one of his very best. In fact, the whole cast excels in their own way; but the actress I'd like to give a special mention to Una O'Connor. She was great in The Invisible Man, and Whale obviously knows that judging by his re-casting here. The special effects are great considering that this was made in 1935, and the ending shows that best. The way that Whale creates the illusion that the characters really are atop of a castle is awesome. As is Elsa Lanchester's short and sweet performance as the title character! Overall, this is without doubt one of the best films Universal ever produced - and one of the great horror classics of all time.",The Bride of Frankenstein

After the parents of the drowned girl discover the Monster had escaped the fire, they are both killed by the Monster. The Monster is then befriended by a blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) who teaches him to speak. A bride is created(Elsa Lanchester) to give him companionship which becomes a horrible relationship from the first look at his face!

Franz Waxman, who created the musical score use   to be employed by Adolf Hitler before WWII. Waxman escaped to America and became a great asset to the movie industry.  Karloff did a great job of scaring the children and frightening the women in many movie houses during the mid 1930'.

This film should be among all horror film fans libraries.",The Bride of Frankenstein
40,StevePulaski,Whale's funhouse,8,31 October 2013,"Bride of Frankenstein seems to be yet another example of a film that was destined for disaster. The film went significantly overbudget, past its original shooting deadline, had to work with the industries of Colin Clive and Boris Karloff, its two main actors, and the risk of having content issues with the censors.However, the film got back on its feet with going overbudget and past its date, dealt with Clive's broken leg by seating him in most of his scenes, dealt with Karloff's hip injury by casting a stunt double, and were fortunate to have the layers of the film dealing with homosexuality and necrophilia go over the heads of the censors (albeit some select lines of dialog). As it stands, Bride of Frankenstein is a witty work of monster art and an intelligently crafted sequel made up of satire and meticulous art direction.The film picks up where the original Frankenstein left off. Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has given up on the idea of trying to ""play God,"" until his wife his kidnapped by his very own creation. To try and reason with the monster, and with the help of Doctor Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), he creates the bride of Frankenstein, a lover for his original creation. The bride (also known as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley) is played by Elsa Lanchester (this time she's credited as ""?"") in a performance of haunting beauty. The first image of her is the most revealing, with her unique hair and bulging eyes that seem to have direct access to your soul. The effect is achieved through the complex, strenuous aesthetic process of getting Lanchester to tape her eyes open.The film is a rare case where the sequel is often regarded as better than the original, but I'm not too sure. The film is definitely great fun, in its self-referential, often obnoxious glory, but it falls significantly short of its predecessor, in my opinion, because of the lack of real jolts or suspense in the premise. However, its significance as a monster movie makes sense seeing as it deals with not one but two monsters, regardless of what direction it chooses to take.I can appreciate, above all, the art direction and cinematography of Bride of Frankenstein, which stands the test of time for one of the best-lit films of the black and white era. It's a rarity for a black and white film to feature such precise and explicit lighting as this film, making everything clear and visible to the audience. Such lighting is necessary when you have art direction as detailed and as meticulous as this.One trait that seems to follow through with every single monster film from Universal, at this point, is the meticulous directorial style each director took. Whale, yet again, directs with a sense to include everything and exclude nothing. All the detail and decor of the macro-sets are captured and the immensity of everything is captured delightfully on screen thanks to Whale's all-inclusive directing tactics.Bride of Frankenstein is another film that is made even more significant, aside from being a great monster movie, because it should've been a complete disaster considering the problems it faced during production. However, it overcame such challenges and became a strong, memorable film thanks to its detailed sets, inclusive direction, great character acting, and a wonderful plot one can sink into. Films like these, even if I find myself not loving them as much as the masses, almost never lose their appeal.Starring: Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Ernest Thesiger, and Elsa Lanchester.

Meanwhile, mad scientist Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) urges Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) to work with him into creating another monster. What results is a more action-paced and suspense-filled movie than the original Frankenstein.You get to see more of the creature and him wrecking havoc to the countryside and scaring its residents away are noteworthy of any classic monster movie. However, we get to see a different side to the Monster when he stumbles upon the home of a reclusive blind man, drawn to him by his violin playing. The two form a friendship that is brief, but touching. It gives a heartwarming feeling of humanity and kindness seen rarely in monster films in my opinion.Boris Karloff gave another creepy and frighten portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster. Colin Clive gave a dramatic performance of Dr. Frankenstein, an improvement from the previous movie in my opinion; Ernest Thesiger gave a mysterious and sinister portrayal of Dr. Pretorius; Dwight Frye, who played Fritz in Frankenstein and Mr. Renfield in Dracula, returns as Carl, Pretorius' assistant. And, Elsa Lanchester gave a brief but memorable role of the title character.Much of the acting was great and brought on more emotion and drama, helped my the inclusion of an effective music score. I wished the title character had more screen time and wished some parts of the movie weren't so rushed, but, it's another classic monster movie that holds up well through time.Grade B",The Bride of Frankenstein
45,sddavis63,"Once Again, Karloff Is The Key",6,31 October 2009,"Just as in the original movie, this sequel to ""Frankenstein"" revolves around the performance of Boris Karloff as the Monster. Again, he provides a portrayal of the Monster as a sympathetic, lonely and misunderstood creature driven to violence not out of nature but as a natural and inevitable response to his circumstances, being rejected by virtually all who encounter him. Karloff is given the added feature of a voice in this film, which ironically may have made his performance less impressive than his voiceless portrayal of the Monster in the first film, which was especially brilliant because of that limitation. Still, Karloff is superb in the role. The scenes in which the Monster encounters and befriends the blind hermit are moving, because they do establish the Monster's basic gentleness, as are the scenes in which the monster anxiously approaches his newly created bride and then deals with the pain of rejection when she is horrified by him.The title aside, the actual ""bride"" appears only in the last few minutes of the film, played well by Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester appeared earlier in the movie, though, as Mary Shelley, who of course penned the original novel on which both movies are based. The opening few minutes portray a conversation between Shelley, her husband and Lord Byron as they discuss Shelley's work, and then Shelley begins to construct this story in her mind. I didn't care for that opening. As much as we know the story is based on Shelley's work, that right off the top gave this movie a clear sense of unreality - it's clearly happening in Shelley's mind as she constructs the story. I also didn't care for the too overt attempts to introduce an almost comic subplot at times. There are a variety of examples of this, notably the ""little creatures"" created by Dr. Pretorius as well as Una O'Connor's rather silly portrayal of the housekeeper Minnie. The title of this movie points to the evolution of the Monster in popular culture. In the original ""Frankenstein"" was clearly Dr. Frankenstein, around whose scientific experiments that movie revolved. By the time of this sequel only 4 years later, ""Frankenstein"" is clearly being used to refer to the Monster itself.Many seem to regard this as superior to the original. How anyone could come to that conclusion I'm not sure. It's not as good as ""Frankenstein."" It's solid and has some good content, but also more than a few weaknesses. 6/10",The Bride of Frankenstein
46,StrictlyConfidential,Meet The Man-Made-Monster's Blushing Bride-To-Be,6,16 May 2020,"This entertaining sequel to 1931's ""Frankenstein"" has Baron Henry Frankenstein (who is goaded on by the sinister scientist, Dr. Pretorius) actually creating a female mate for his lonely, man-made monster.Impressively directed by James Whale - This 1935 horror-movie production (for the most part) holds up quite well, today (nearly 90 years later) - Though, because of its age, you really do have to forgive it for its noticeable shortcomings.Containing lots of eerie atmosphere - This vintage film's highlight is, of course, the bride's unveiling, followed by her reaction to her intended husband.

47,gridoon,Warning: this is an irreverent comment.,5,13 October 2002,"Right from the extremely hokey prologue, I knew that I was going to be disappointed with this film. I was right. This film has lost much of its edge over the years. You can still appreciate it intellectually, of course, for its historical importance (the prototype for horror sequels), you can admire its great sets, and watch some memorable, famous sequences. But it is never scary in the slightest, and none of the characters is developed enough. Elsa Lanchester has only a couple of minutes as the Bride, but she upstages the rest of the cast with her heartbreaking performance - she plays it straight. Perhaps the rest of the movie would have benefited from a similar approach.    (**)",The Bride of Frankenstein
48,ElMaruecan82,Stealing the original's thunder... literally...,9,30 April 2018,"""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is so hypnotic in its eeriness, so intelligent in daringness and capable in wackiness that it had me puzzled for a while, caught in a long brainstorming in order to decide whether it was better than the original, as it's often said to be, or not. To put it simply, it's better because it's not just brilliant but brilliant in the way it doesn't prepare you to its own brilliance. After the first fifteen minutes, I thought James Whale was parodying himself, I couldn't think of Una O'Connor as a comic relief but rather a symptomatic attempt to deconstruct in the most over-the-top way all the established notions of the predecessor. And when Doctor Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) showed his little squeaking 'homunculi', there was no doubt anymore, something was too outrageous about ""The Bride"" not to be intentional, and it took me some time to appreciate it. Then the story slowly and confidently unfolds its most wicked twists with a score and a photography so penetrative we're immediately lured into it. The Monster saves a woman from drowning as to make up for his previous crime, he tries to make friends, making an actual friend out of a blind hermit in a touching and satisfying emotional interlude, then the Monster learns how to speak, longing for a mate and domesticating his own terror of fire, mirroring our own rooting process. And finally, twenty minutes before its conclusion, action rises up to an ultimate spellbinding ride, reminding us that the film was after all about ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", in case we forgot... I think I almost did. In fact, the film was so visually and narratively dense that it makes you easily forget how little screen-time the Bride has.And yet she's still what makes the greatest impression of all, which says a lot about the movie and its status in the ghostly Pantheon. The image of the Bride, played by (but not credited as) Elsa Lanchester, with the towering hair and the trademark streaks, her robotic movements as if she was still infused with electric power and her unforgettable scream when her eyes meet Frankensteins', all these moments rival with the iconic ""It's alive!"" scene from the first. It goes even further than that, I mentioned in my review that the 'alive' scene was perhaps the most climactic non-climax scene ever, but here it's played for the climax and you can tell James Whale made the process even more heart-pounding with the apparatus and the lightning effects on the two professors' faces playing like Morse-like flashy allegories of the rhythm of our own hearts. As far as our ears and eyes were concerned, what a sequence!Indeed, when you watch ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", you have the feeling nothing was left to chance and James Whale knew he had to outdo the original in every single department... and he miraculously did. We don't get the original disclaimer from Van Sloane but a surrealist discussion between Lord Byron and Mary Shelley played by a pretty and natural-looking Elsa Lanchester, the introduction uses flashbacks from the original film but the cast of Lanchester is a masterstroke in the way it points out that even the loveliest creature can have a monstruous counterpart. Van Sloane who played a rather bland tutor is replaced by Thesiger who, no pun intended, steals Clive's thunder and becomes a fascinating and unforgettable mad scientist figure, indulging to a few hammy and over the top dialogues, but indispensable as the foils to Frankenstein's retrieved sanity. And Frankenstein, of course, played by Boris Karloff (credited as Karloff), like Garbo, finally talks and while it doesn't deprive him from his sensitive side, it highlights a new tragic dimension as he can put words in his needs but doesn't have them fulfilled for all that, and finally concludes the film with a line that represents his only possible existential impulse sealing his fate as a tragic movie figure... and only getting from his Bride a hiss magnificently ad-libbed by Lanchester like Hopkins would do a few years later to make the 'chianti' line even more memorable, some remember ""We belong dead"", I'll remember that hiss. And yes, she's only there for a few minutes but she marked horror movies forever, becoming the first female monster of cinema... created by two men, doesn't that ring a bell? In ""Interview With the Vampire"", a male vampire sucked the blood out of a little girl's neck and his companion provided the taste of blood that would save her life albeit turning her to a vampire. While the homoerotic subtext between Louis and Lestat couldn't even escape from a numb attention span, the move was even more daring as it featured a conception of life from two men, as if only in the movies, the miracle could ever happen... and be plausible in its realm of fiction. If not directly based on Mary Shelley's book, ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", sixty years later, proved to be of similar boldness and it is a mystery whether James Whale intended it as a wink to his own sexuality. But while in my first review, I insisted on the sexual innuendo more than the religious undertones, the sequel creates a fascinating parallel between Frankenstein and Adam with the two men creating an Eve-like figure. The religious aspect of Frankenstein is even more apparent in scenes where the Bible is mentioned in a disdainful way as if there was no difference between Mary Shelley's fiction, the one she's about to tell in the opening and the story of Frankenstein, making the whole film an even more revolutionary for its time, so daring and so magnificent in terms of special effects.""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is a landmark of the horror genre, fascinating to deconstruct but works even better as an entertaining flick.",The Bride of Frankenstein
49,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A bizarre meta conceit reduces the impact of this interesting and sometimes heart-warming picture.,6,11 May 2018,"'The Bride Of Frankenstein (1935)' is framed by a bizarrely meta and wholly unnecessary conceit, wherein author Mary Shelly recounts the tale as a sort of 'what-if' extension to the first film. This is a weird choice that not only retroactively tries to convince us the characters from the previous entry survived their deaths but also reduces the portrayed events to simply a story-within-a-story, thereby significantly reducing their impact and damaging their credibility - to the point it almost feels like a fan-fiction. Thankfully, there's a greater focus on Frankenstein's monster this time around, who is portrayed commandingly by Karloff and who's only flaw is perhaps his tendency to talk too much - or at all, for that matter. There are some genuinely heart-warming moments involving a blind man who he befriends, even if the short scene turns into an advert for smoking at one point. It's a shame, too, that the eponymous 'Bride' is only given three minutes of screen-time, as she is interesting in her brief appearance during the exciting finale. 6/10.",The Bride of Frankenstein
50,Cineanalyst,Queer Doubling,10,23 August 2018,"The sequel ""Bride of Frankenstein"" essentially improves upon every slight deficiency of the original ""Frankenstein"" (1931), and it does so largely by doubling everything. It's a sequel, after all. Instead of one mad scientist, there are two, with the second madder than the first; there are two ""brides"" of Frankenstein; two monstrous creations, the second more perfect than the original supposed abomination; and two narratives with the inclusion of a prologue of Mary Shelley, the author of the original novel, narrating the main story, in which she is attended by two men (Lord Byron and Percy Shelley), just as the monster's bride (played by the same actress in dual roles) is attended by two doctors before the original monster interferes; and even within the main story, there's a dual focus for the most part between the scientists playing God and the monster on the loose; and within the prologue, another narrative via the recap of the prior film as narrated by Lord Byron. There's a mise-en-abyme, too--doubling by a scene within a scene--with the homunculi of Dr. Pretorius. Added to this is the improved sound quality of a 1935 production compared to the creaky 1931 original, the addition of a musical score throughout, canted camera angles, sustained low-key lighting, grander set designs with a multitude of Gothic arches, a more elaborate laboratory décor, quicker editing (its average shot length of about 4 and 1/2 seconds is about half that of the '31 film) and a lot of camp.In my review of ""Frankenstein,"" I preferred to view the monster as an imperfect metaphor for film: edited together from different parts that were once alive but now dead, reanimated by the projection of electricity, and befalling disaster like inflammable nitrate film stock in a fiery climax, complete with a windmill turning like a film reel on a projector. ""Bride of Frankenstein"" may be viewed likewise, with the addition of the homunculi sequence stepping in as a kind of film-within-a-film to make the self-reflexivity explicit. The sequel is open to other interesting interpretations, though, besides the basic level of grotesque horror. The Christ allegory is more obvious this time, with the monster continuing as the ""son"" of a ""god,"" his being lifted up as if crucified in one angry mob scene, there being Christian iconography prominently displayed in several sets, and, ultimately, the monster even commits something of a self-sacrificial act. With all of the doubling, Shelley's original Gothic dopplegänger theme is more prominent, too, and Pretorius becomes yet another, along with the monster, reverse-mirror-image antagonist to Dr. Frankenstein. Rather less fortunate in regards to doubles is that the thankless part of Elizabeth is replaced by another actress, although I'd say a better one merely because she delivers her silly lines deliciously well; I especially love how Valerie Hobson says, ""it's blasphemous and wicked."" Una O'Connor is also a fun addition as the lady's handmaid Minnie. Meanwhile, Dwight Frye, the hunchback in the original, returns, but in another guise as the murderous Karl--a comparatively small part, which, reportedly, was larger in the script, but later reduced.Perhaps, the most interesting way--and one I'm sure has been done to death--to interpret ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is a queer reading of it, especially given the reported homosexuality of director James Whale and others involved in the production and the film's campy treatment. The camp is announced from the beginning, especially by Gavin Gordon as Lord Byron rolling every word off his tongue in such an affected manner and by Elsa Lanchester's giddy portrayal of a paradoxical Mary, ludicrously feminine in her knitting while supposedly masculine in her telling of horror stories. Although fitting given its inclusion of the author within the film, it's, nevertheless, rather surprising that ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is more faithful to the novel than is the 1931 version, although both are generally loose reworkings of it. Although hardly as eloquent as his literary counterpart, the monster, at least, speaks this time, and, as in the book, he threatens the life of Elizabeth so as to force Frankenstein into making him a mate. He also saves a girl's life only to be scorned nonetheless and tries to make friends with a blind man.Yet, unlike Shelley's story, this Frankenstein fulfills his creature's request. This creation scene is also the most homoerotic of the series. Portrayed by two reported homosexual or, at least, bisexual actors, Colin Clive and Ernest Thesiger, Pretorius steals Frankenstein away from his beloved, as they retreat to work together in a phallic-shaped laboratory tower to give birth to a woman without a mother. Also notice how much more attention is given in this sequel as opposed to the original in the upward lifting of the creature to give it life. Next to Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version, it's the most sexually-suggestive creation sequence and far more phallic and devious than most, with canted angles, dramatic music and quick cuts of darkly-lit views of Frankenstein and Pretorius as they frantically create life together. Besides a better realization and expansion of the dopplegänger theme in Shelley's book, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is also quite apt in its misogynistic depiction of man creating life without a mother. Expanding on this, the bride is punished by the male monster after she affirms her self-agency and, possibly sexual, preference for Frankenstein while screaming at the sight of him. Also notice the patronizing emphasis on the procuring of the female's heart, whereas it was the brain that was most vital for the male monster.Plus, Thesiger was a master of camping it up; he and the monsters (Karloff and Lanchester) steal the show. No other Universal monster movie or Frankenstein film is quite as enjoyable and succinct on so many levels.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Many people comment that this is one of those rare sequels better than the original, and technically, formally, that's true. But the first Frankenstein is terrific, too, despite its creakier construction and some slow scenes, and for me it's a better movie. This has the really silly parts with the miniature people in jars, and the awful acting in the scene with the writers talking about the story (Lord Byron, feel free to roll over in your grave). And the original (from 1931) has originality on its side, and and the amazing first cries in the stony castle, ""It's alive, it's alive!""Here we have the moving scene with the blind man, key to understanding the soul of the monster, and there is a sequence of ever changing sets and problems for the monster to cope with. The finale is sudden, for sure, but that is better than dragged out, a different kind of resolution might have been more effective, at least for contemporary viewers. But it's dramatic--indeed, the whole movie is dramatic, and the lighting and sets alone are worth the ride. Seeing Dr. Frankenstein back in an extension of his first mania is confirming in a good way (it makes the first film stronger) and the real depth given the monster is maybe what makes the movie powerful in away that goes beyond sensation.See them both. Some individual scenes in Bride are astonishing, and it'll never get boring. Of the five or six period Frankenstein films, these two are head and shoulder's above the rest, and above most horror films from the 30s.",The Bride of Frankenstein
53,CuriosityKilledShawn,Here comes the Bride,7,15 April 2011,"It turns out that the Monster wasn't killed in the windmill fire at the end of the first movie. As a matter of fact he's roaming the country looking for friends and shelter while the usual torch and pitchfork brigade are after him. Meanwhile the Doctor and his wife would like to just move away and forget about it all, but another mad scientist, Doctor Pretorius, blackmails him into making a mate for the monster.The early scenes with Pretorius are ridiculous, and his 'miniature people' collection almost turns the movie into a spoof. It's saved by yet another moving performance by Boris Karloff (no longer credited as '?') who brings real empathy and emotion to the tragic monster. Another curious element is the metafictional edge created by the appearance of Mary Shelley and Lord Byron in the prologue. An interesting idea sadly rendered redundant after Universal cut 12 minutes from the film.A worthy sequel, but it needs a little and a little more to make it truly great.",The Bride of Frankenstein

It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too ""campy"". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, ""Scared Stiff"" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy.The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie.

Well, Frank gets an ""E"" for effort!",10,12 December 2007,"It is no secret hat most any sequel or sequels, if you will, just don't measure up to the original. Hence forget about JAWS 2, DEATH WISH II, FRENCH CONNECTION II and AIRPLANE II, THE SEQUEL.* For the most part, these titles are brought up quickly from dubious origins on short-length drawing boards. These are made, for the most part, for only the reason of the bottom line; namely more money! There are many exceptions, of course. We seemed happy to get enjoy learning about the ""colorful"" life of ROCKY, and we had the sequels of ROCKY II, III, IV, V and ROCKY BALBOA to prove it. Of course, Mr. Stallone did manage to expand the legend, broaden the storyline and keep the audience interested by evolving the character development and tweaking of the plot line in having the Protagonist having to deal with the sudden loss of friends, family and other loved ones. So, we can agree that some sequels are just fine, serving as extensions of the original story and enabling a more intricate and full development of the characters. ** We kind of feel that THE GODFATHER, Part II (1973) is possibly the finest example of a sequel equaling, even topping the original. The success of FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1931) gave rise to another good and obvious candidate here in James Whale's BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1935).Following up what was arguably THE horror film, the grand-daddy of so many others and a sure trend setter was certainly a shaky premise, sitting out on a sure-fire precarious perch, just waiting to be knocked off. But the result came out far better than one would expect.In BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Director Whale took all that was seen as unique and well-received from FRANKENSTEIN and not only included it in BRIDE, but elaborated it and added other useful elements. Hence, what we see is a much more open spaced, yet no less atmospheric and moody. The creative use of the fine Black & White photography continues, but there is a little noticeable movement of the shots and angles used.It is quite obvious that the success of JamesWhale's FRANKENSTEIN and his THE INVISIBLE MAN (1933) caused a sharp rise in his stock with a corresponding increase in his ability to get things done his way, additional funds and an overall autonomy in his work that was unknown before.*** One obvious luxury in BRIDE was the opening sequence, the ""Prologue"".Oh, how I used to hate that part of an otherwise great piece of Horror. Just think of yourself as being about 11 or 12 and having to sit through this mushy stuff with Elsa Lanchaster as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Gavin Gordon as George Gordon Lord Byron (complete with the Sifty Leg) and Douglas Walton as Percy Bysche Shelley. Yeah hated it is the best description for those feelings of so long ago; but time heals all and it also tends to mellow us on a lot of attitudes-at least outwardly, showing acceptance, if not inwardly feeling so. (Besides, it's a handy and sneaky, method of providing exposition for the overall multi-film continued story, a neat bridge to Storyline Past. Kinda sounds like Dickens, no; or do I flatter myself?) OUR STORY..On a stormy evening in what would be a rugged Swiss Mountain Chalet (Ms. Mary Wollenstone craft Shelley's native land) , the Authoress herself tells Lord Byron and Percy Shelley of how her story of FRANKENSTEIN The Novel had not ended, but would continue beyond the scene of the Monster's being trapped in the old, burning Windmill. The Young Baron Frankenstein (Colin Clive) had survived the fall from the Windmill's propeller and soon became the Baron, his old man having checked out. He is soon joined by one of his old Professors from the University (GO STATE!), the now banished Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesinger) who compels Young Frankenstein (get it?) to collaborate with him on the creation of a Female Monster.There are so, so many excellent scenes and developments to get mentions for all. But a few are: the Monster's way of escaping the burning Windmill, the kindly Holy Man Hermit's meeting with the Monster, how Fritz (Dwight Frey) uses his own methodology in procuring fresh body parts, Dr. Pretorius' little folks and the Female Monster (Elsa Lanchester) having been all decked out in White, like a Bridal Gown, and her quick and thorough rejection of the Frankenstein Monster with such unearthly screams. (Don't feel bad, Frank, old boy; I used to get that treatment from girls a lot!) NOTE * This business with sequels got so bad that when I asked a guy at work if he'd seen APOLLO 13, he answered, "" hell no! I haven't even seen APOLLO 1 to 12 yet!"" NOTE: ** Certain developmental occurrences proved to be very advantageous and enjoyable. For example, in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Karloff as the Monster, learned how to talk, though very primitively. It was really a great, though short lived plot and story device; as the Monster quickly became the ""strong, silent type"" by completely forgetting his speech prowess in another sequel, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1939).NOTE *** We cannot in good conscience close without mention of the change in the sound track. In FRANKENSTEIN and the other early Universal Pictures Horror offerings, the sound track only had music as an opening and closing. With the release of Films like KING KONG (RKO, 1933) a had phenomenally successful Max Steiner Score and Mr. Whale's own THE INVISIBLE MAN (Universal, 1933) with mostly stock music by W. Franke Harling. But in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN we are treated to an original Franz Waxman score (Overture and Incidental themes) that has gained immortality and is as familiar as any work by the Old Masters.",The Bride of Frankenstein
60,poe426,Fairy tale...,7,15 June 2010,"Director James Whale opens BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN with a prologue that really amounts to a disclaimer of sorts. His intention, apparently, is to forewarn us that this one isn't to be taken too seriously. Certainly, HE doesn't take it too seriously: the ""fourth wall"" is even breached at one point (when Ernest Thesiger, as the prissy Dr. Praetorius, actually winks at the camera). The whole notion behind the movie- necrophilia is suggested- may have been ""beneath"" the cultured tastes of director Whale. BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is ALL technique- form, without a shred of substance: beautiful at times to look at, but ultimately empty and vacuous, often as cold as a Kubrick exercise in photography and film-making technique. Cinematic tricks of the trade harking all the way back to Georges Melies are trotted out- but to what end? (And, speaking of ""ends,"" BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN lacks an EPILOGUE: this omission has confounded critics and horror historians alike; even William K. Everson, in his otherwise excellent overview, CLASSICS OF THE HORROR FILM, expresses confusion over why the bride of the monster doesn't survive the climax to appear alongside the monster in SON OF FRANKENSTEIN. The reason is made obvious by the prologue: BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN- which SHOULD'VE been titled BRIDE OF THE MONSTER- is a mere fairy tale told by Mary and doesn't really fit into the Universal continuity: it's a fairy tale, as it were, within a fairy tale.)",The Bride of Frankenstein
61,johnnyboyz,One of the more superior sequels you'll see and another superb addition to the Universal horror archive.,8,1 July 2007,"Bride of Frankenstein is definitely one of the more memorable sequels of all time. The first Frankenstein film was a truly memorable exploration of horror and was extremely advanced for its time; dealing with issues of modernity when the doctor starts talking of space travel and also pushing censorship to levels it hadn't been pushed to before; having characters exclaim they 'knew what God felt like' and also including images of dead bodies and murder. With Bride of Frankenstein, certain elements of surprise have been lost but the film delves deeper into its characters and explores different things to make it more of an 'entertaining' film.The film doesn't hang around and cleverly introduces the story through the original author Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) dictating what it is that happens next. For a film in 1935 to use such a technique and manage to include elements of heartbreak when we assume Dr. Frankenstein is dead, horror when The Monster re-emerges AND murder when someone mistakenly crosses him all in the first ten minutes or so, is extremely impressive and is only the result of fantastic direction through great, inventive ideas.Then, the film uses the character of The Monster as a sort of MacGuffin. It is reduced to a wondering, babbling, hulking thing getting into mischief as it makes its way through the forests nearby but this isn't a bad thing. What we see is the first example of the characters in this, so far, series of two films develop. The Monster starts to develop emotions of pity when it sees someone in the forest in trouble and attempts to rescue them as well as intelligence because it manages to get itself out of trouble when danger threatens it  there is no excuse for this development of ideas and intelligence but it's interesting to see anyway.What's more, this wondering and random character is a great excuse for it to cause havoc and/or get into adventures of its own and this it does to a basic level. Apart from stumbling across a picnic of some description when everyone assumes its safe since when last they heard, he'd been captured; The Monster gets involved with a seemingly lonely man who lives in a log cabin in the woods. The curse here to me is that I'd seen Kenneth Branagh's 1994 Frankenstein before this so I knew what was up and how things would develop.As a result, it was predictable to me but to fresh eyes what follows between The Monster and this man is an education and a friendship that truly supports evidence that this film really is all about developing characters such as The Monster further away from the 'dead' tag and closer to the 'human' tag. Not only this but Dr. Frankenstein himself is leaning more and more towards a 'normal' life away from insane experiments; tempted back only by blackmail. About half way through, Frankenstein's creation manages to get himself into a bit of trouble and is caught but escapes so soon afterwards, the sequence passes off without too much suspense or interest which was disappointing; also, the character of Minnie is so obviously an attempt at comic relief that she becomes annoying quite quickly although I suppose they had to include this character to stop the film appearing too dark.If Frankenstein from 1931 was an out and out horror shockfest for the time, Bride of Frankenstein remains a character piece full of 'what would happen if.....' a mindless, homicidal lab creation was loose in rural Europe. Some of the later scenes still made me squirm a little when the 'mate' is being created and if you can look past the rushed ending; you'll see a sequel to a film miles ahead of its time, ahead of its time.",The Bride of Frankenstein

63,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Greatest Sequel of it's time. Took the Sci-Fi Horror genre to Next level.,8,18 October 2020,"Bride Of Frankenstein (1935) :
Brief Review -The Greatest Sequel of it's time. Took the Sci-Fi Horror genre to Next level. Welcome to the world James Whale where just monsters aren't enough to scare you but also some human values defines the narrative. Frankenstein (1931) is hailed as First Ever Major achivement in Sci-Fi horror but the sequel goes beyond Sci Fi horror things and adds human values to connect the right chords. What i recall from Frankenstein is that it was a Sci-Fi Horror where we get to see all the scientific stuff at the beginning and once the monster is created it's all about mass murders. But here in Bride Of Frankenstein those scientific experiences last till the climax and plays vital parts in bringing subversive change and diversity in the most hated character of the film. The story begins where Frankenstein ended, the Monster survives and another mad doctor is obsessed with the idea of creating a Monster's Mate. All comments on the Frankenstein suggested that the Monster was Evil and bad but in this sequel we meet his harmless side and his needs of friendship. The idea is so great to see because in the horror genre the monster is always shown slimy and Bride Of Frankenstein shows how good he can be and the way he realises human emotions in the climax is an outstanding piece of fictional writing. Karloff as Monster gets everything right about the character and set the benchmark which is unbeaten till date. Colin Clive has less to do but effective, the new face in his fiancee's role Valerie Hobson looks fine. Ernest Thesiger is the biggest surprise as Dr. Pretorious. This is one of the rare films where people and ciritics liked to recall about technical team more than celebrities. The cinematography, background music, visuals and production design are astonishing. Hats off to James Whale for setting a Landmark.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",The Bride of Frankenstein

65,funkyfry,James Whale's best film,10,19 September 2007,"James Whale's ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of horror film. Whale took the bones of his resurrection-man classic ""Frankenstein"" and expanded upon pretty much everything, losing a little of the horror (which was probably inevitable, since the monster's appearance no longer shocks) but adding greatly to the humor and characterization Most of the original characters are here, including Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive), and most are played by the original players with the notable improvement of Valerie Hobson (Clive's co-star in ""Mad Love"", if I'm not mistaken) as his fiancé Elizabeth. Karloff has returned, and despite reservations about giving the monster dialog, he surpasses his work in the original film in terms of bringing pathos to the character and actually manages to keep him somewhat fearsome despite the amount of time he's on the screen. Even Dwight Frye returns in a slightly different role despite being disposed of in the first film. Frankenstein's father has been killed somehow (his death is mentioned but no details give) so now he is ""Baron Frankenstein."" There are 3 notable additions to the cast however. Una O'Connor brings her own particular brand of over-the-top lower-class humor to the film, screeching and squawking with the best of them. She's one of the most divisive elements in the film for fans, but I personally don't feel she ultimately adds or detracts much from the film. Elsa Lanchester makes an unforgettable impression as the Bride, securing cult stature for decades. Her movements have always reminded me of a crazed bird so I wasn't surprised to read that she had modeled the ""hiss"" on actual swans she had observed in London parks. She also appears in a cheesy but charming prologue as the author Mary Shelley. The introduction lets us know right away that this film will not be as serious as the first film, and also sets up an interesting parallelism between Shelly and the female monster by having the same actress perform both parts. For these reasons alone its inclusion should not cause the controversy it seems to cause.As much as Lanchester adds to this second film, however, even her contribution isn't as memorable as Ernest Thesiger's inspired Dr. Pretorius, the mad doctor who blackmails Frankenstein into resuming his experiments. Probably my single favorite moment from this classic film is Pretorius midnight snack in the catacombs, where he meets Frankenstein's monster. Like the monster, Pretorius belongs among the dead and feels more comfortable among them than with his living accomplices. That's an interesting idea, but it's the humor of the scene that really carries it. Unlike the sometimes intrusive humor of O'Connor and the burgomeister, the humor here and in other scenes with Pretorius is of an appropriately macabre variety for horror film. It's dark humor of the type associated with the ""Grand Guignol"" school of theater from the late 1800s which continued through ""EC Comics"" and films of people like George Romero up through the present day. To suggest (as some have done) that it's out of place in a horror film is to display a rather limited understanding of the appeal and depth of the genre, I think. This is actually the type of thing that smart storytellers have always done in tales of whimsy and fantasy to entertain both the young and impressionable and the older and more cynical.In fact on the whole ""Bride of Frankenstein"" deserves praise for being so multi-faceted, for offering up so many different kinds of entertainment that surely everyone in the theater could find something to enjoy  and yet at the same time it's a celebration of abnormality and it revels in its own weirdness. There is very little inconsistency in its tone because the source of much of its humor is the same as the source of much of its romantic power  irony. Few can resist the allure of sympathizing for the creature, rejected by its creator and now returned to become the catalyst for creation himself  he even tells Frankenstein to ""sit down"" exactly as Frankenstein told him in the first film. The cruelest irony is the fact that the monster is perhaps the kindest and most innocent character in the story, and must be tortured and rejected by society because he is different. And I think here we have a key to Whale's understanding of the story and the deeper significance of some of its Christian and homo-erotic symbolism, as simple as it may sound. I think Whale very efficiently communicates the concept that we should be careful about how quickly we judge good and evil, like the monster who fears fire and smoke because of his history and doesn't realize how much good fire can do  let's not forget we're talking about an adaption of a novel subtitled ""The Modern Prometheus."" The message is not subtle but it is powerful and convincing.I simply can't talk about all the exceptional aspects of this film in the space allowed. Franz Waxman's score is one of the all-time best horror/fantasy scores and has been re-used and imitated in hundreds of other films but none quite so excellently as here. Photographer John Mescall and Whale are a perfect combination  how else could you produce so much wicked humor from expressionist designs. I particularly love the creation scene, which surpasses that in the original both in scope and detail through a brilliant montage.Speaking as a fan of Universal horror films from the 1930s, this one surpasses them all to my tastes  dark humor, ruminations on mortality and physical determinism, homo-erotic Christ imagery used for ironic effect.. this movie does so many things that have never been done before or since.",The Bride of Frankenstein
66,A_Kind_Of_CineMagic,Beautiful Bride!,9,19 March 2009,"This follow up to Frankenstein by the same director, James Whale is easily better than the first film which was more primitive but was very good. Bride is brilliant and far more polished and flawless than its predecessor.All the acting is up to a better standard with Karloff equally superb to his first appearance as the monster and the great addition of Dr. Pretorius excellently played by Ernest Thesiger. It is also atmospheric and beautiful.One of the truly great parts of the film which is rightly very famous is where the monster arrives at a cottage inhabited by a blind man. This is a wonderful aspect of the story and is done superbly here. It is often thought to be part of the first film as it is a well known highlight of the Frankenstein story. Its inclusion in this film adds to its superiority over Whale's previous Frankenstein film.One of the greatest and most influential horrors of all time.",The Bride of Frankenstein
67,FiendishDramaturgy,"It seems that most people either love this work, or hate it.",9,9 March 2006,"This is, further into the movie, a strong sequel. Karloff is more comfortable in his role as the misunderstood creation of a mad man. Some might think this would make an actor sloppy with the representation, but it did no such thing. Karloff was astounding! This is also the second chapter of the Frankenstein saga parodied by Mel Brooks in ""Young Frankenstein."" If you are of the generation who venerates Brooks, there are doubtless countless scenes in which you will find familiarity.The movie begins on an odd note. Mary Shelley insists that her work was unappreciated as a ""tale of morality"" and considered a work of fantasy alone. She then regales us with part two of the tale. Doctor Henry Frankenstein has been convinced by all around him that his genius was a sickness of both the mind and the spirit, and therefore, he must be ""cured"" of his intellect.Tormented in his current state of confusion and conflicted desires, Henry is ripe for the coercion of an even more troubled scientist who has grown his race of man from seed only to discover they are four inches tall. He needs Henry's insights and knowledge in order to make his race a reality by resurrecting a mate for his earlier creation.The monster, meanwhile, has survived the burning windmill and is in search of his own humanity.Karloff's performance is nothing short of brilliance and even Clive seems more involved in his portrayal.In some ways, this production surpasses the original In others, it is inferior. As surprising as that is, these inconsistencies in no way make for an uneven work. This production feels almost schizophrenic in its quiet urgency one moment and its in your face delivery the next. It is quite compelling work.The performances are not nearly as cryptic or over the top as one might expect from a 1935 production. The few bits which were over the top were required for the moment. I actually enjoy this installment quite a bit. It picks up where the last chapter left off, and it continues with a quality which is comparable to the first. That was quite a feat.The finished product presented by the Universal Legacy Collection features a fully restored soundtrack and digital transfer from the best source Universal could locate. Unfortunately, these are only available in Full Screen format.All in all, even with the ""I Love Lucy-"" era music peppered here and there, this is a wonderful installment and still a classic, no matter how dated this work becomes.It rates a 9/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Bride of Frankenstein

69,bsmith5552,Here Comes the Bride,8,12 May 2004,"""Bride of Frankenstein"" is considered by many to be the best of the Frankenstein films. Although I personally prefer the first installment for its originality, this one is nevertheless a close second. The movie opens with a prologue featuring poets Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton) and Shelley's wife Mary (Elsa Lancaster) who wrote the Frankenstein novel. The trio discusses the novel and we are treated to a brief flashback of the 1931 film. Mary then says that there was more to the story and begins to tell the rest of it and this is where our film begins. The story begins where the first film ended at the site of the flaming windmill. All of the villagers are satisfied that the monster (Boris Karloff) has perished in the flames. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has been injured and is taken to his home to recover with his fiance Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) at his side. The father of the little girl murdered in the original is however skeptical and goes searching through the ruins for proof. He falls through an opening into an underground stream where, you guessed it, the monster appears. The monster kills the parents of the little girl and goes about terrorizing the countryside. The villagers under the burgermeister (E.E. Clive) soon capture the monster and insure everyone that all is safe. Meanwhile the mysterious Dr. Pretorious (Ernest Theisger) visits Henry and proposes that they work together. He coerces Henry to accompany him to his home where he shows him that he too has created life in the form of a series of little bottled figures (which really seems out of place). In the meantime the monster escapes and comes upon the hut of a blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) playing his violin. The music soothes the savage beast and the hermit gains the monster's confidence. They become friends and the hermit teaches the monster about life and how to talk. Unfortunately two lost hunters (John Carradine, John Curtis) come to the hut for directions and discover the monster, The monster escapes and finds the entrance to a mausoleum where he finds Dr. Pretorious and his two criminal assistants, Karl (Dwight Frye) and Ludwig (Ted Billings) at their evil doings. Pretorious befriends the monster and uses him to force Henry into helping him to create a mate for the monster. The monster abducts Elizabeth and holds her hostage to ensure Henry's cooperation. Finally Henry and Pretorious are successful and a female monster (again Elsa Lancaster) is presented to the monster. Friend? But will they live happily ever after?  Director James Whale gives us the more of the creepy atmospheric settings as in the first film. The laboratory settings are now legendary. Karloff (now being billed only by his surname) again gives a standout performance as the monster. The scenes at the Hermit's hut are quite moving. Colin Clive is way over the top again and Valerie Hobson is fetching as Elizabeth.
 There are a few inconsistencies with the first film. When Henry is being taken home, someone is sent to inform his father the old Baron. When Henry arrives, there is no Baron and he has a ""new"" fiance in the person of Hobson. There is also a new burgermeister. Dwight Frye in effect has two roles in this film. He is seen as Fritz the hunchback in the flashback scenes and as Karl, Pretorious' assistant in the main story. Oddly enough, this was the only one of the Frankenstein films in which the monster speaks. In the next sequel ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) he is again speechless.",The Bride of Frankenstein

The monster is captured, escapes, and finally ends up back at Castle Frankenstein, when Henry and his new collaborator, the nefarious Dr. Pretorius are busy creating him a bride. The iconic last scenes are some of the most memorable in horror movies, due both to James Whale's consummate direction and Elsa Lanchester's fantastic interpretation of the newly awakened bride. Karloff, masterful behind the make-up as always, is given a chance to bring some humanity to the misunderstood creature, most notably (IMO) in the pitiful gestures for mercy he makes to the hunters just before they shoot him. The almost surreal black and white cinematography and Franz Waxman's outstanding musical score sets the perfect mood for the story of life, death, and longing. Arguably the best of Universal Studios classic horror films: even after 80 years ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is both entertaining and an excellent example of the art of film-making.",The Bride of Frankenstein
71,Polaris_DiB,Successful arrangement,6,14 January 2010,"Everything expands. Following a pretty terrible prologue involving the Shelley's and Lord Byron during a storm as an excuse to ""In Our Previous Episode"" the movie, James Whale returns to the expressionistic sound stages of his iconic Frankenstein universe, where true to sequel form the main players manage to escape the death defined for them in the previous installment, the body count rises, and the world is opened up to more possibilities. Herein is the blind violinist so expertly parodied in Young Frankenstein, the Bride so iconic that despite her maybe two minutes of screen-time manages to seer herself into the viewers mind, and Dr. Pretorius, the guy who, less Dr. Frankenstein's previous salvation be a tad sentimental to the audience, enjoys being pure evil incarnate. The production values go up, too, as in general acting, editing, and sound improve against an already striking set.Technically, this movie is somewhat closer to Shelley's book than the first film. The monster learns language, and the arranged marriage works as well as any modern arranged marriage would (i.e., it doesn't). This is not really a significant factor in the movie, however, since the Universal Monster's Frankenstein Monster Universe is far removed from Shelley's original prose, so this sequel of course operates better as a further fleshing out of Whale's created world as opposed to a mimic of Shelley's. Pretorius and his two Igors instead of one is a strange demon to appear on Frankenstein's shoulder, but it does lead to some fantastic set-ups, including a chilling and out-of-nowhere reveal of doll-sized people grown from Pretorius'...*Ahem*....seed.Definitely a kooky and campy outing, I can see why people tend to like this better than the original. Certainly the macabre humor hits a lot of high notes.--PolarisDiB",The Bride of Frankenstein
72,lugonian,Frankenstein II: The Saga Continues,9,1 September 2001,"THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1935), directed by James Whale, improves over the original 1931 shocker starring Colin Clive and Boris Karloff. This time, KARLOFF, as he is billed, gets to have his surname over Clive, making this the only time in the history of the FRANKENSTEIN series to have the actor playing monster with his name coming out on top in casting credits. This time, Karloff's Monster is the central character while Clive's Frankenstein comes off in the supporting category, but is in no way a secondary character.For this sequel, the story opens with a prologue with Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) discussing her latest novel, FRANKENSTEIN, with Lord George Gordon Byron (Gavin Gordon) and Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), including flashback scenes from the 1931 movie leading to the Monster's demise in the burning windmill. She then informs her listeners that there is more to the story, which soon fades to the windmill scene where the earlier movie left off, showing a crowd of villagers watching the windmill where the Monster was trapped, burning to ashes. Among the villagers is Hans (Reginald Barlow), the father of Little Maria whom the Monster had drowned. Hans insists on going down to see the Monster's burned body so he can sleep at night, but after he falls through a trap door, Hans is encountered by the living Monster (Karloff) who has survived the fire in the water beneath the mill, thus killing him while a sleepy-eyed owl watches, and later doing away with Han's wife (Mary Gordon). The body of Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is returned to his fiancé Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson), but it is discovered that Frankenstein is very much alive. Aside from the Monster roaming the countryside once again, and Frankenstein going through the guilt for what he has done, and planning on leaving the German village with Elizabeth, there is Doctor Septimus Pretorious (Ernest Thesigner), one of Frankenstein's old teachers, arriving in the middle of the night (how appropriate). He hopes to get together with Frankenstein in not only showing him his own creations, such as miniature figures of people he grew from seed, but to present him with the idea of creating a woman/bride for his Monster. At first Frankenstein refuses, but finds he has no other choice when Elizabeth is kidnapped and will not be returned until the bride is created, as well as given much more persuasion by his creation, now assisting Pretorious. Then there is that memorable climax after the creation of the monster's mate (?)...Aside from Thesigner's scene stealing performance as the ultra weird former professor of philosophy who finds drinking wine to be ""his only weakness,"" there is also Una O'Connor, a bird-faced character actress who seems to have more scenes than the principal players. Occasionally amusing, sometimes annoying, O'Connor's role is no different from her scream-fest performance in James Whale's earlier masterpiece, THE INVISIBLE MAN (1933). One particular memorable moment in this production that should not go unnoticed is the Monster's encounter with a lonely blind hermit (O.P. Heggie), who not only takes the Monster into his little cottage and making him his friend, but teaches him some table manners and how to talk. With the Monster in the initial film being played as a cold-hearted beast, this time, Karloff succeeds in presenting his Monster character as a simple-minded creature who is not a cold-blooded killer, but really looking for a friend, and unable to find one because of his hideous and misunderstood appearance. While this scene between the Monster and the blind man might have been laughable, both actors succeed in making it quite moving mainly because of its sincerity, even with Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" underscoring, and the Monster being moved to tears as the blind man prays to God for bringing him a friend, everything about this tender scene works. Look fast for John Carradine as one of the hunters who comes to the cottage asking for directions, and for Dwight Frye, who played Fritz in FRANKENSTEIN, as another freaky character, this time as body snatcher named Karl. In spite of some faults with the continuity, possibly due to script changes during production, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN plays more like a fantasy than a fright fest. It also includes some Hollywood in-jokes, religious overtones, as well as great underscoring, compliments of Franz Waxman. Originally completed and ready for distribution at 92 minutes, the movie was presented in theaters at 74 minutes. According to Bob Dorian, former host of American Movie Classics, where THE BRIDE once played from 1991 to 2002, and later on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: October 6, 1998), the deleted 16 minutes of footage is believed to be lost. At 75 minutes, this lavish production is atmospheric, plays fast, and well acted. And there is Colin Clive (1898-1937) in the role that made his short-lived movie career immortal to future generations of horror fans. One debit, however, is a scene in the early portion of the story where Valerie Hobson's Elizabeth overacts in fright when she imagines seeing ghosts approaching her and Henry. It's not too convincing. Otherwise, next chapter, THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939). (***)",The Bride of Frankenstein

74,drqshadow-reviews,This Bride Left Me Feeling Jilted,4,22 October 2021,"What a strange departure. Where the original Frankenstein was simple but direct, lean and effective and memorable for the right reasons, Bride of Frankenstein is forced, meandering and overproduced.Disregarding the ending of the initial adventure is a bad way to start, especially when that moment was such a key part of what made the story so powerful. Here, after a long dalliance in Mary Shelley's parlor(?!) and a rapid recap of the saga so far, we learn that creature and creator have each miraculously survived near-certain doom, and neither appears to have learned from their mistakes. I say this because both are almost immediately right back at it, doing the same crap that delivered them to death's doorstep in the first place. For a mindless monster, that can be forgiven (though Bride quickly transforms him from a stumbling hulk of raw emotion to a speaking, stogie-smoking antithesis), but Doc Frankenstein had effectively denounced his own actions when last we saw him. And why should I buy in for the epic conclusion this time, knowing how permanent the last one turned out to be? You just erased it an hour ago!Still, the chase to replicate the mad doctor's one-off experiment is a catchy catalyst; the potential of a mate for the lonesome creature a tempting tease. The giant's passing friendship with a blind priest is strong material, if far too fleeting and simplistic. There are several such effective flashes, glimmers of potential amidst all the oddball distractions and broken promises, but they're entirely unrefined and unrealized. Worst of these offenders is the bride herself, who exists more as an idea than a legitimate character. After so much anticipation, it's tough not to feel deflated when she springs to life for all of five minutes at the very end and then fizzles out like a wet firecracker. Efforts are made to conclude the story with profundity once again, but this time the lesson is less organic and nuanced. A blunt, strained farewell for a gaudy, pointless sequel.",The Bride of Frankenstein
75,robfollower,Monsterpiece!,10,12 May 2019,"Mary Shelley reveals the main characters of her novel survived: Dr. Frankenstein, goaded by an even madder scientist, builds his monster a mate.Universal intended to make a sequel to the monsterously successful film (Universal's policy was to use the same crew for the next film, which is why production was delayed four years, waiting for the director to become available again).It has been noted, but the original 1931 FRANKENSTEIN should be seen first, as this one picks up the storyline where FRANKENSTEIN left off. Considering the combined running time of about 140 min, both films can easily be watched back to back.The story sets off with a clever prologue between Mary Shelly (a short but great performance by Elsa Lanchester who also plays The Bride) and Lord Byron, who asks her to continue the tale of Dr. Frankenstein.With almost the same cast including Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Boris Karloff as the creature, Whale takes us to a mythical world where gods and monsters are alive and temptation can be deadly.Enter Dr. Pretorious, as an admirer of Frankenstein's work, he is decided to create his very own creature for his evil purposes; but first he must convince Henry to work with him. The creation will be a female version of the monster, since Pretorious has convinced the creature that all he needs is a partner.The acting is superb, with the addition of Elsa Lanchaster in a double role as Mary Shelley herself, and Pretorious' creation; Ernest Thesinger as Dr. Pretorious clearly steals the show as the mad scientist who tries to change the world. His performance makes us to be both horrified and attracted to him. He is the Mephisto of Frankenstein, a seducing tempter whose only concern is his own good.Whale's Direction is outstanding and the expressionist influence is notable through the film, giving it a very special look that sets the mood for the story.A masterpiece in its own right, this movie is a MUST see.

77,pixrox1,A clear-cut case of spouse abuse!!,7,17 July 2013,"BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, ""She's alive, she's alive!"" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: ""You stay......we belong dead.""

78,CubsandCulture,A queer classic,10,21 November 2020,"This is one of my all time favorite films and it also one of those films that I am still surprised that it got made. Whether it is the ironic Christ allegory (the creature goes through the stations of the cross in reverse chronologic order) or the subversive (read: gay) subtext of Pretorius tempting Henry off the umm straight narrow path I am surprised what Whale got away with. The film is exceeding lush in all its aspects and it still feels like a contemporary film. The score, the special effects and especially the acting are all top notch.Much like how the film seamlessly blends horror-comedy, the film's view of humanity is so grey. After all Minnie and the townsfolk are the ying the hermit's yang. There is a deep sense of disdain for humanity in contemporary society coupled with a deep love of humanity in itself present here. This is a wonderful plea for understanding and acceptance.",The Bride of Frankenstein

This film is even more visually striking than the original with aggressive and stunning shot framing and the film quality is a step up as well. In this film, which picks up right after the first film ends, Dr. Frankenstein wants to create a mate for the monster. He has already made several miniature human-like beings he keeps in glass pedestals, which are nifty and creative film techniques for the 30's. In the meantime the monster has escaped his shackles and befriends a blind hermit. Thinking the monster is just a normal person who cannot speak, he connects with him as he himself cannot see. The monster having finally made a friend gets chased away by the search party. Having lost a new friend, will the monster finally get a female mate to befriend or to marry?

This movie is a total mess.",The Bride of Frankenstein
81,MissSimonetta,Poignant and beautifully shot,10,18 January 2014,"Ever since it has become common to name Bride of Frankenstein (1935) as superior to its predecessor, it has become more frequent for fans to denounce it as being an overrated camp-fest. It is true that it is less of a horror film than the original: while it has spooky atmosphere, Bride is more of a dark fairy tale about loneliness and the need for love and companionship. As has been said before, Karloff is phenomenal as the monster in search of a friend, Ernest Thesinger nearly steals the movie as the wicked Pretorious, and Elsa Lanchester makes for a beautiful but uncanny undead bride.If there is one thing Bride has over its predecessor, then it's the cinematography. This movie is just gorgeous. The creation of the bride alone is a masterpiece and more visually exciting than the original's iconic scene, all canted angles, rich black-and-white, and frantic editing. Unlike Frankenstein (1931), this film has a musical score by the wonderful Franz Waxman, evoking mystery and eeriness while still keeping that Grimm fairy tale feel.A possible drawback would be Una O'Connor as the house maid, Minnie. While I can tolerate her and even get a laugh or two from her antics, some might find her too shrill for their tastes. While Valerie Hobson is warmer than Mae Clarke as Frankenstein's wife Elizabeth, she can go over-the-top as well (the scene where she freaks out over ""the shadow of death"" approaching Henry is the only part of Bride that makes me cringe).In the end, I would say this film and the original are on par, just very different in tone. Both are work checking out.",The Bride of Frankenstein
82,JoeKarlosi,Bride of Frankenstein (1935) ****,10,14 September 2006,"Reactions to this, James Whale's ageless masterpiece, are varied; some say it just could be the Greatest Horror Film Ever Made, some think it's just an overblown tongue-in-cheek comedy sham. Probably Whale himself would have been the first to label his picture a ""farce"", but count me among those who think it's a brilliant piece of work, well in consideration as one of the undisputed top-tier horror classics of any decade. It qualifies as horror, but mostly plays along more like a child's twisted storybook fantasy. It's renowned as one of the few movie sequels which may be considered even better than its original (in this case, that would be James Whale's 1931 FRANKENSTEIN). While I think both films are excellent, with the first being more serious in tone than its follow-up, I'd give the hair's edge to BRIDE.Boris Karloff returned to portray the Frankenstein Monster, and he gives what is easily one of his finest performances. Here, the scarred creature emerges from the charred windmill he was burned in, and falls into the unscrupulous hands of the demented Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger, note-perfect in a part he seems born to play). Pretorius was once a colleague of Henry Frankenstein, the monster's creator (Colin Clive), and now connives his way back into the disinterested Frankenstein's life just as he's about to wed his fiancé, Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson). This time, the idea is to fashion a female for the creature, and Pretorius enlists the hulking Monster as an anxious partner into his scheme.Karloff gets to talk as the Monster in this film, and while the actor himself believed it was a mistake to give the creature speech, I must respectfully disagree; it made him even more pitiable and human. The film's most wonderful sequence features the wandering creation stumbling awkwardly into the hut of a lonely blind hermit, who cannot see and therefore is unable to judge the Monster strictly from his unnerving physical appearance. Instead, he offers the creature food, water, and a place to sleep, while teaching him the most basic forms of communication. It is a truly great cinematic moment.There is very little to quibble about within this film (Valerie Hobson's hysterical Elizabeth comes the closest at achieving that), and Whale's passion for lightweight comic relief in his horror films works perfectly. Aside from Thesiger's Pretorius, much of that comes courtesy of Una O'Connor, who is a delight as Frankenstein's sniveling maid. Elsa Lanchester immortalized herself forever with her electrified hairdo as the Monster's intended Mate, and she is also seen early on in a dual performance prologue as the more dainty Mary Shelley, the author who ""penned the nightmare"". Franz Waxman's glorious score punctuates the wondrous proceedings. **** out of ****",The Bride of Frankenstein

85,slokes,Hollywood's Strangest Sequel?,5,5 June 2007,"The only thing odder than director James Whale making ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" after ""Frankenstein"" would have been if George Lucas had made ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as a musical.Whereas ""Frankenstein"" presented a serious-as-death horror flick, ""Bride"" presents us with over-the-top comedy. The continuity is off, with some characters like Victor and the Baron disappearing. Others reappear played by different actors. Most seriously, the most important role, and one played by the same character, goes from being a mute walking corpse to a chatty dancing machine, albeit still with homicidal tendencies.Okay, the Monster (Boris Karloff) doesn't dance so much as bob his shoulders in time to violin music, and his chattiness is mostly monosyllabic. Though last seen pinned under a burning rafter, he emerges in ""Bride"" none the worse for wear. Soon he is loose in the countryside again, while Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is approached by the mad, amoral Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger). Pretorius demands Dr. Frankenstein take responsibility for his creation and replicate his ""success"" by building another beast.The comedy of ""Bride"" would be more welcome if it worked within the context of horror. Instead, it feels absurd for the sake of absurdity, like Una O'Connor playing the hysterical servant Minnie or the tiny people Pretorius keeps in jars. ""Frankenstein"" works as an exercise in existential bleakness. ""Bride"" plays itself off as a nihilistic joke, less a true horror film than a Monty Python bit with lamer humor.What does work in the film is Karloff as the Monster. Despite the miscue of letting him speak this time, Karloff does bring empathy to his role. It's enough to almost allow for Whale's unsure handling of his character. Half the time the creature is a mad killer, and the other half of the time, merely misunderstood. At least with Karloff at the controls, you know the Monster will give the right amount of chills, and he does.Also good is Dwight Frye, returning from ""Frankenstein"" this time in the role of another henchman figure, just as compellingly creepy. Thesiger is also compelling that way, a lively figure amid an otherwise sleepy cast. ""You and I have gone too far to stop, nor can it be stopped so easily,"" he tells Frankenstein. To the Monster's comment ""I love dead...hate living"", Pretorius deadpans: ""You're wise in your generation."" He's a bit problematic in his arch drollery, but at least he adds to the proceedings, even if he distracts from the film's menace.Whale doesn't do nearly so well with the other actors. Even Clive seems miscast playing the role he established so effectively four years before. The story goes off in weird, unresolved tangents like the strange fate of the Neumanns that never are properly explained. None is weirder than the opening, where we see Frankenstein's creator, Mary Shelley, with her lover Percy Shelley and their friend Lord Byron. I should say ""Lorrrrrd Byrrrrron"" for the way the guy rolls his R's. (I enjoyed ""haygraphs"" bright comment from March 2004 about how the prologue has the characters ""looking back"" on events taking place a century hence.)Whale may be celebrated today as an early gay director, but his penchant for jump cuts, awkward close-ups, and florid overacting should have stayed in the closet. ""Bride"" may have a certain camp sensibility its enthusiasts enjoy, but as a horror film it is neither scary nor successful.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Karloff is once again brilliant in his role. No other would have fit in the role of Frankenstein's monster as perfectly as Karloff, no other actor could have played the role of this lonely, misunderstood creature with such brilliance. Karloff does not play the Monster, he becomes the Monster, and this unique talent makes him one of the greatest actors who ever lived. Period. Elsa Lanchaster also delivers an outstanding performance in her unforgettable role (she actually plays a double role in this). Colin Clive's performance as Dr. Frankenstein is once again excellent, and Ernst Thesinger is absolutely ingenious as the insane Dr. Pretorius.

87,Steffi_P,"""A new age of gods and monsters""",7,4 October 2010,"Sequels have long been one of the most embarrassing products of cinema, because they tend towards repetitiveness and faddish cash-in value rather than originality and integrity. At its inception Bride of Frankenstein seems to have represented all that is worst about sequels. It reopens the story of a perfectly structured picture that needed no further elaboration, indeed rewriting the end of that picture in order to make the new story fit. As if this audacity was not enough, we open with no less an authority than Lord Byron recapping the plot of the 1931 movie, even though that was only loosely based on his contemporary Mary Shelley's novel. This whole set-up has a feel of ""it's probably been a few years since you saw the original, so won't notice you're essentially being shown a substandard knock-off, only with bigger sets and better makeup"" which is essentially all Bride of Frankenstein is, in outline at least.Somewhere along the line however, the picture was apparently hijacked and turned into a farcical and self-deprecating comedy. Original screenwriter William Hurlbut was no funny man, but the script would go through several other hands, including those of the very talented R.C. Sheriff who was the primary writer on The Invisible Man. This was probably all under the auspices of the somewhat ribald and rebellious director James Whale. In fact, much of the comedy material has the look of having been improvised, especially that with the wildly over-the-top Una O'Connor, so is probably that of the team on set more than any writer. Bride of Frankenstein takes the silliness of horror-comedy The Invisible Man and takes it one step further, from jolly counterpoint into absolute parody. It's hard to know where the overt melodrama ends and the hysterical daftness begins – all in all a good thing, because if this were just melodramatic horror cliché it would be a far poorer film.At pre-production however the original aim seems to have been to increase the sinister and creepy atmosphere of the original. The sets, not only larger, are far more baroque and expressionist. Even the Frankenstein family home, a fairly regular mansion in 1931, is now a cavernous Gothic castle. The result is tonal overkill. Whale, rather than trying to restrain this inflated production, simply indulges. His trademark tracking shots are at their most effective here, foreground props all over the place and wheeling manoeuvres that give real resonance to those interiors. Other than this however Whale's direction is for the most part a little more relaxed than usual, as if what is before his camera is bizarre enough.So, all this overstatement, the cheerfully dismissive manner in which characters are bumped off, the screeching of Una O'Connor (not very funny, but I do love the way she says ""just because he's a burgomaster"", sounding wonderfully out-of-place with a cockney accent) was clearly done for a purpose – sending up the strains of pompous melodrama, fighting fire with fire. But does the exaggerated approach rescue Bride of Frankenstein from typical sequel trashiness? Not quite. The tone here is not so much one of triumphal reworking as one of flippancy. It seems that Whale and whoever else was on his side were simply reacting against the commercial lowness of the picture as the studio intended it. It's quite clear Bride of Frankenstein is a product of conflict more than collaboration and when compared to its predecessor is a rather middling affair.",The Bride of Frankenstein
88,ShootingShark,Two Mad Scientists Team Up To Make A Mate For A Monster,6,12 December 2007,"Frankenstein - a scientist who has created a monstrous man from cadavers - survives a terrible fire and is approached by the demented Dr Pretorius, who has been working on similar research. Pretorius convinces a reluctant Frankenstein to create a woman, a mate for the Monster, who also survived the fire and is terrorising the countryside.Universal's smash-hit sequel to the granddaddy of all horror movies is one of the most famous, entertaining, influential films of the thirties, filled with memorable scenes - the grandiose opening with Byron and the Shelleys, the Monster's touching friendship with the blind hermit (which is beautifully pastiched in Young Frankenstein), Pretorius' mad dinner-party in the crypt and Lanchester's unforgettable appearance as the hissing Bride. Many consider it the rare example of a superior sequel, although personally I prefer the original; the Monster is less sympathetic and more conventionally brutish in this film, and the decision to make him speak (something Karloff disagreed with) detracts from both his mystery and his pathos. It's still fantastic fun though, and the cast are great - Whale is a little too enamoured of Thesiger's camping (he seems to act purely with his prodigious nose) and O'Connor's shrieking, but Karloff and Lanchester are both outstanding and Hobson (who was only seventeen), Frye and Heggie are all excellent. The iconography of this film, a combination of Whale's stylish direction, Charles Hall's art direction, Jack Pierce's famous makeup and John Fulton's special effects, is unforgettable, from the Monster's first appearance in the flooded basement of the windmill to the hermit dolefully playing Ave Maria on his violin to the crazy tilted angles on Frankenstein and Pretorius during the lightning storm to the silver streaks in the Bride's Marge Simpson hairdo. Deftly scripted by William Hurlbut, with lots of cool lines and a clever ambiguity to the film's title - literally it's Hobson character but figuratively it's Lanchester's. I don't believe direct sequels are ever better than their predecessors (especially The Godfather: Part II) but this one almost is, and remains one of the very best of the classic Universal monster movies of the thirties. Sort of remade (with mixed results) as The Bride in 1985.",The Bride of Frankenstein
89,truemythmedia,The Best Universal Monster Film,10,21 June 2019,"This is one of the few Universal Monster movies that I've seen multiple times; it's a film that I truly love. It's stranger and creepier, more violent and emotionally impactful, and technically speaking, it's miles ahead of its predecessor. But most importantly, it's a movie that gives the Monster depth- it makes him a character with hopes and dreams, and a want to belong- it makes him far more sympathetic and far more interesting than he was in the original. I can't recommend this film enough, though, if you've got the time, I'd recommend doing a double feature of this film and it's predecessor to get the full effect. If you do that, you'll really be able to see how much of a difference even four years made for the technical aspects. This film isn't only a great story with peculiar events and a tragically emotional finale; it's an important piece of film history that I believe any self-respecting cinephile should see.

90,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Sequel to a Classic,8,6 June 2019,"Growing up I didn't really see any of the Universal classics. I had a thing against black-and-white horror films back then and my parents weren't really fans either. My love for old cinema started in college when I took my film classes and it really changed my mind. I sought this film out as part of a box set with all of the Frankenstein. The synopsis for this one is Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) reveals the main character of her novel survived: Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) goaded by an even madder scientist builds his monster a mate.This film begins with a prologue with Mary Shelley along with her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Walton) and Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon). It is storming outside and Lord Byron goads her into telling a scary story. She reveals there is more to Frankenstein.We are then back at the windmill that was set on fire and it has burned down. The body of Dr. Henry Frankenstein, the creator of the monster has been found and they believe him to be dead. They are taking him back to the castle where his fiancé is waiting. The monster isn't found and Minnie (Una O'Connor) wants them to keep searching. The Burgomaster (E.E. Clive) tells everyone to go home. The monster (Boris Karloff) isn't dead, but there was an underground cavern. He emerges and flees into the countryside.We then go to Castle Frankenstein. The body of Henry is placed on a table and his fiancé Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) comes to look at him. The sheet is removed and everyone starts mourning. Minnie ends back up at the castle and she is the first one to realize that he's not dead. Henry wakes up and taken up to his bed.The monster continues through the countryside where he continues to wreck havoc. It isn't trying to, but the monster doesn't know any better. It does get arrested, but the chains can't hold him back. He does end up meeting a blind man who teaches him things. That comes to an end and he ends up meeting Dr. Pretorius, who enlists his aid in convincing Henry of what needs to be done.This would be my third viewing of the film, with the last two in the theater. I do have to say that I have enjoyed this film with these last two viewings. I think coming in at first, I had some lofty expectations that it didn't live up to. With those out of the way, I know can really appreciate what this film does.Something I really liked about this film is that they continued where the previous one left off, with just some minor changes. They didn't return all of the same actors, but I will let that slide for this film. I also enjoyed this one took parts of the novel that were left out of the previous film and used it in this one. Examples of this are when the monster learns how to talk, even though it is different in the novel. I think how it is presented here is believable. The idea of creating a mate is also something that is in the original novel as well, but it is the monster's idea.Now this film does have some issues though. One that I really didn't like was the fact that the bride is not created until the very end of the film and then there is something that happens to end the film immediately. I would have liked them to do it a little earlier and had used her more. This is actually very common for films in the era though.I will say that the pacing of the film was good, but mostly because of the low running time. Much like its predecessor, it moves through the story pretty rapidly I think if they could've come up with a sub-plot or two to deepen the story, it might have helped build a bit of tension. That is something that this one is lacking for me to be honest. I still enjoy it, but really the only the fear of Henry has for the monster that forces him to work. I'm not the biggest fan of the ending as I feel it's just too abrupt.The acting for this film was really good. Many films from the era though really did come with strong acting from what I can tell. Karloff is great as the monster. He can convey so much with saying so little and learning to talk is similar to a child. Which makes sense as it has only been alive for a couple of days. Clive is also as the mad doctor. I like that he is tottering on losing his sanity from the start, keeping in line with his character. Hobson was solid in her role as well as being quite attractive for the era. I loved Thesiger as the villain. He fit the role so well and is quite dastardly. I would have liked to see more Lanchester. I will say the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.Something else from the era is the lack of effects. That is mostly because cinema was still relevantly new. I actually don't care for the look of the monster, but I did like the look of the bride though. It is more in line with the novel there. This one also seems to have a higher body count. We don't know if anyone dies that the film seems to claim does, but there is a lot of possibility to that. It is also shot very well.With that said, I would recommend this film to be viewed. The acting is very good and this one holds up well as a sequel to the original. I liked that they kept the continuity of the story and didn't add anything that would alter or make something that happen in the previous not make sense. I also liked that they brought up a couple more aspects from the novel not used in the previous film. I will warn you that it is from the 1930s and is in black-and-white. If that is an issue, I would avoid this film. If not, this is a solid film that can be viewed by itself thanks to the prologue, or watched in the series of Frankenstein/Universal horror film series.",The Bride of Frankenstein
91,Amyth47,CLASSIC HORROR.,8,8 February 2019,"My Rating : 8/10Director James Whale's sequel to his earlier smash hit ""Frankenstein,"" is considered not only one of the great horror films of the ages, but indeed, a classic movie in any genre.Boris Karloff reprises his role as the Monster, but this time learns how to speak with the help of O.P. Heggie as the blind hermit. Their relationship in this film has been the subject of debate for years due to Whale's own sexual preference.Elsa Lanchester is the ""Bride"" of the title and also appears as author Mary Shelley in the film's brief prologue. According to her associates, Lord Byron and Percy Shelley, little Mary has a lot of explaining to do. With some minor prodding, she soon gets the film rolling as she begins her 'sequel' to the story.CLASSIC STUFF.",The Bride of Frankenstein
92,EdgarST,The Bride Takes Some Fresh Air,10,29 November 2016,"""Bride of Frankenstein"" will play in the open air next Sunday, as part of the first edition of Panama Horror Film Festival, so I felt inclined to write a few notes, remembering the first time I saw it. The opening sequence is as precise as a good clock: in it humor is mixed with dread in perfectly administered doses. Minnie, Dr. Frankenstein's meddling servant, goes to the mill where the monster died in the first installment of the series, and discovers that he is still alive and ready to destroy anything blocking his way. Minnie runs screaming and so arrives at the Frankenstein castle to break the news. In the following minutes, unforgettable images, sequences and scenes follow, such as a funeral in silhouette, the entrance of Dr. Pretorius to the scene with his gallery of miniature human beings, the monster's stay in the hut of a blind hermit, until the films finally reaches the sequence of anthology when the bride is created, when all the elements of the plot are combined in a tragic and delirious ending, that does not erase the smile or sense of wonder in our faces. The director was maestro James Whale, British filmmaker and theater director who retired from film in 1949 when Universal's management took the control he had of his films. This control allowed him in 1935 to reunite an almost foreign cast to tell a European history: Boris Karloff (the monster), Elsa Lanchester (the bride and Mary Shelley), Ernest Thesiger (Pretorius), Una O'Connor (Minnie), Valerie Hobson (Mrs. Frankenstein) and E.E. Clive (the burgomaster) were all Whale's compatriots, while Colin Clive (Dr. Frankenstein) was born in France and O.P. Heggie (the blind), in Australia. Of the British cast, besides Karloff in an exceptional performance full of nuances under the heavy makeup for the role of the monster, for me three also stand out: O'Connor, the eternal sneaky little lady who brings humor; then Thesiger, Whale's friend, as the diabolical and effeminate scientist, collaborator in the creation of the monster's bride; and especially Lanchester, as a trapped little bird, immortal, fantastic, touching, in those few minutes in which she fills the screen, to the chords of the wonderful score of Silesian Franz Waxman. It is curious that not only did Whale reject the genre of horror movies, but also the film industries of the world, which for long years assigned derisory budgets to the projects, until they recognized it that it could also have style when Stanley Kubrick made ""The Shining."" The genre was validated by the middle class in all its ""terrestrial replicas"". But before Kubrick, terror geniuses shone with one, two or several masterpieces each, as Whale (in spite of himself), Tod Browning, Jacques Tourneur, Mario Bava and Terence Fisher, to name but a few. ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is genuinely one of those high points.",The Bride of Frankenstein
93,gazzo-2,It's great. Best of the Frankie series.....,9,21 October 2005,"Wow. This was very very well done. And FUNNY---some of these lines by Thesinger and O'Connor struck me as being Pythonish--esp the line about the 'slimy stairs'--that had me laughing rather hard. You just Don't expect that in a 1935 Monster movie.Karloff was at his best here. Colin Clive is too stagey and you do notice how Rookie-ish both Lanchester and Hobson are at times. But they're certainly fine on the eyes and make it worth seeing more so. I liked the Monster's doings-shambling round the woods, meeting the blind man, the Gypsies, etc. etc.-Frankenstein is given 10 times the amount of screen time here as in later entries in the run; it's a pity they didn't do this more often.The rest of the raves you read here about this movie--about the makeup, acting, dialog, etc-well I pretty much agree w/.

Picking up right after the original ends, with Mary Shelley telling the story of what happened, it never has a dull moment. While Karloff didn't want the monster to talk, his speech and his friendship with the hermit is the highlight of the movie.

95,mike48128,The sequel that surpasses itself,10,29 October 2018,"ZIGGY5446 (12 Dec. 2006) does such a splendid review that I will not attempt to top it. Therefore I will add only a few comments. Perhaps the ""gayest"" mad scientist of all time, ""Dr. Pretorious"" waltzing through his role with incredible gusto and panache. He is incredibly funny and evil at the same time. His ""mini-creations"" are not exactly monstrous but are certainly unique, if not bewitched. Director James Whale was reportedly ""gay"" as well? Dr. Frankenstein is once again portrayed by the tormented alcoholic actor who died soon afterwards, I believe. Remember that The Monster is never named, but becomes known by his creator;s last name anyway. Is this my ""guilty pleasure"" or merely the best Frankenstein movie of all time?",The Bride of Frankenstein
96,Sergeant_Tibbs,Lightning strikes twice.,8,16 September 2014,"The sequel to the iconic horror classic Frankenstein is an oddball one. That's part of its charm. The Bride of Frankenstein sounds like a piece of parody rather than a sincere followup, and in a way it's awareness of its sometimes satirical nature makes it stronger than its straighter predecessor. However, its finest facets are its ahead-of-its-time technical aspects. The stark cinematography is astonishing and the precision of its sharp editing is unprecedented, let alone the reliably impressive production design. It's a much more entertaining and enduring experience than other films of the 30s. James Whale got much better conviction out of his actors this time around and it deals with the moral consequences of their actions rather than leaving it to loud anguish. While the film is a bit of retread of the first film as Frankenstein's monster is chased from place to place, it adds development and essential sensitivity to his character leading its tragic end to be much more meaningful in its destruction. This was a very pleasant surprise, ominously horrific and slyly comic, without the two clashing.8/10",The Bride of Frankenstein
97,frankde-jong,One of the best sequels in film history,9,29 May 2020,"After seeing (and enjoying) ""Bride of Frankenstein"" I read a few reviews. One review in particular took me by surprise. It was remarkably negative about this classic movie. The main points of criticism were that ""Bride of Frankenstein"" added nothing new to ""Frankenstein"" (1931, James Whale) and that it contained irritating humor, mainly in the person of housekeeper Minnie (Una O'Connor).It is right that the theme of ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is essentially the same as the theme of ""Frankenstein"". It is the ""beauty and the beast"" theme. A monster craving for friendship but meeting only rejection due to his repulsive appearance. The ""beauty and the beast"" theme has in this film however not a romantic connotation, such as in the film of the same name by Jean Cocteau (1946). The monster is craving for friendship, not for love (the word ""Bride"" in the title is therefore a little bit confusing).As I said, I enjoyed the film and do not agree with the criticism. The theme maybe the same, the way it is told is unique. The monster is even rejected by his fellow female monster and only a blind man gives him the friendship he is looking for.If housekeeper Minnie is a comic relieve or just irritating is a matter of personal taste I think.""Bride of Frankenstein"" is already worth seeing because of the first and the last 10 minutes. The first 10 minutes firmly establishes a mood of Gothic horror. The last 10 minutes contains the scene in which the bride is brought to life. In my opinion this scene is better than the comparable scene in ""Frankenstein"" and the scene in which the Maria lookalike in ""Metropolis"" (1927, Fritz Lang) is brought to life added together.With respect to the cast most of the cedit usually goes to Boris Karloff, who plays the monster of Frankenstein. However Ernest Thesiger as Doctor Pretorius also gives a brilliant performance. He is the scientist who has the hubris of playing God ( a second theme in the film) and he is more convincing as the mad scientist than Colin Clive, who plays Doctor Frankenstein in both movies.And what about Elsa Lanchester? She plays the writer Mary Wollstonecraft in the first 10 minutes and the Bride monster in the last 10 minutes. Is it a coincidence that the scenes in which she appears are exceptionally strong? I think it is not. The monster of the bride has very little screentime, but has become iconographic nonetheless. Originally the plan was to give her role to Brigitte Helm, the actress who plays Maria and her lookalike in ""Metropolis"". Fortunately Elsa got the role.For me ""The bride of Frankenstein"" is one of the best sequels in film history, along with films such as ""The Godfather part II"" (1974, Francis Ford Coppola) and ""Aliens"" (1986, James Cameron).",The Bride of Frankenstein
98,pyrocitor,Triumphs of horror and horror parody lumped together with twisted genius befitting its creator,8,13 September 2010,"While most films celebrated as genre classics generally function to fulfill the set of expectations associated with them in the cultural lexicon, James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein marks one of the most pointed examples where one's enjoyment of the film could prove largely contingent on watching without being bogged down by expectations. After vocally disdaining the idea of a sequel to his initial horror classic, Whale instead runs with the opportunity to play with an expanded budget and deliver even more surreal, somber yet gruesomely funny metaphoric musings on life, death, conventional relationships and sexuality and more, all under the guise of straightforward Gothic horror. And Bride of Frankenstein could still easily be appraised as a classic 'traditional' horror movie strictly, but remaining unaware of Whale's fiendish playfulness would doubtlessly leave many a viewer scratching their heads as to many creative choices. The trick is to regard Whale's approach as half self-parody, half serious and all willfully weird, extrapolating (and in many ways 'remaking') his initial classic in a subtly experimental, conflicting yet successful tonal fusion. Alternating between moments of high camp (the bizarrely flamboyant character of manipulative scientist Dr. Pretorius feels a cheeky prodding of the regulations of the Hays code) and heartbreaking poignancy (the Creature's infamous encounter with a blind hermit and the unforgettable reaction of the Bride laying eyes upon her 'friend' for the first time), Whale's film is a perpetually unsettling watch, darting between tone and approach for the sake of an unexpectedly arresting product.This is not to say the film is without fault: the reigniting of elements of the first film feels largely contrived (turns out the Creature isn't dead! Nor is Frankenstein! Let's toy with morals and build another monster!), though whether this is a self-effacing joke on Whale's part or not is unclear. Equally, when viewed without the context of its predecessor, the primary characters do feel noticeably underdeveloped, and there lies an uneasy use of cinematic metaphor, whether religious (one scene, in which the Creature is bound and carried on a log, blatantly evokes Christian iconography) or a bizarre underlying theme of the dangers of substance abuse (the Creature's gruesome reputation is partially equated with its gorging itself on cigars, alcohol, food and lusting after women). Nonetheless, Whale retains his flair for filling films with delightfully gruesome, cartoonish supporting players (Una O'Connor's screeching maid toes the line between hilarious and infuriating) and phenomenal set design, torn between solemn Gothic and discordant expressionist terror, giving the film a uniquely disturbing aesthetic. No matter how much the film creeps into oddity, Whale always capably anchors it throughout from descending into surreal chaos, delivering a remarkable balancing act whose clashing elements serve to only make their points more effectively. Reprising his iconic horror creation, Boris Karloff proves most adept at bleeding aching pathos from his misunderstood Creature's whimpered attempts at human contact, as scenes of him ferociously snarling and stumbling around risk being (un?)intentionally funny. Colin Clive, the 'straight man' anchor to the variable strangeness surrounding him, hits a sturdy balance between charm and nervy perfectionism as Dr. Henry Frankenstein, and Valerie Hobson instills a considerable earnest glow into her limited scenes as Frankenstein's fiancé. Elsa Lanchester delivers a dual triumph of performances as both a savvy Mary Shelly in the film's prologue and matching her astounding hair and makeup job with an equally nervy and fascinating performance as the Creature's 'Bride'. That said, it is truly Ernest Thesiger who walks away with the show as the delightfully strange Pretorius. Though verging on feeling downright out of place, Thesiger's grimly knurled face and mad giggle somehow manage to epitomize the spirit of the picture: though almost too strange to fit, somehow ambitious and deadly twisted enough to transition from comical spectacle to deadly serious moral manipulation. Though it seems the cultural lexicon has largely forgotten how strange and self-effacing the film truly is, Whale's Bride of Frankenstein boasts a fearless flair for experimentation, thematic exploration and tonal fluctuation to match its iconic visuals. As telling as any of the potential for mad visions unleashed on mainstream entertainment, Whale's work, though more tempered by age than many of its kin, still stands out as essential viewing for fans of horror, cinematic fun and psychoanalysis alike. -8.5/10",The Bride of Frankenstein

Previously it was the Baron filling the ridiculous and out of context character role, now that pleasure goes to Minnie, a construction so irritatingly misplaced you could easily halt proceedings and turn your attention to something else entirely, although the characterisations are generally pretty poor all round.

100,Pumpkin_Man,An Almost Perfect Sequel That's Better Than the Original!!!,10,12 October 2017,"I've been watching all the old Universal monster movies to get read for Halloween. Yesterday, I watched Bride of Frankenstein and it was a lot better than I remembered from the last time I watched it. In my opinion, I think it's better than the original 1931 classic. It continues the story right where the original leaves off without being too repetitive, like most sequels. It really advances the story like the monster meeting a blind man and befriending him. The man teaches the monster how to talk. Meanwhile, a doctor named Pretorius comes to Henry and wants to work with him in creating a mate for the monster. Henry refuses, but Pretorius teams up with the monster and kidnaps Elizabeth to get Henry to do what they want. If you want a good decent old school sequel, you'll love BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN!!!",The Bride of Frankenstein
101,BrandtSponseller,Campenstein!,10,5 February 2005,"Series note: Although not imperative, it is strongly suggested that viewers take time to watch Frankenstein prior to Bride of Frankenstein. This is a linear continuation of the story of the first film, and the characters and motivations will have more meaning if you watch the series in order.Despite appearances to the contrary at the end of the first film, Frankenstein (1931), the monster has survived. The quickly recuperating Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is paid a visit by Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), who has been engaging in similar research into the creation and restoration of life. Although Frankenstein wants to quit the business after the atrocities documented in the first film, Pretorius tries to persuade him to continue, while at the same time, the monster starts to become more sophisticated.Although many fans prefer Bride of Frankenstein to Frankenstein, they are both 10s to me. Given tastes and typical comments about modern horror films, it is surprising that this film is the usual preference, as it is even more rooted in surrealist/absurdist fantasy and it is loaded with a wicked, campy humor--at times the film is more of a spoof of the first than a sequel.But at that, I love it. I love fantasy, surrealism and absurdism and I like my horror to be campy and humorous as much as I like it to be serious. Director James Whale had acquired more ""Hollywood clout"" in the four years since making the original film, and said that he wanted to treat Bride as a ""hoot""--he found the premise to be ""highly amusing"". And that it is. Whale gives us whimsical elements from minor characters, such as Minnie (Una O'Connor), who provides a healthy dose of comic relief during the monster's ""resurrection"", to major characters' mannerisms, such as the Karloff's portrayal of the monster's newfound abilities and subtlety. Pretorius has a flamboyantly questionable sexuality (the film is permeated with all manner of complex sexual metaphors) and his creations are as bizarrely goofy as say, Jar Jar Binks (from Star Wars Episode 1 (1999)), although they do not dominate the film in the same way.Often noted as a standout element are the sets, and rightly so. Like the first film, the gorgeous sets show a heavy influence from German expressionist films, but here they are even more grand in scale and they are also more numerous and varied. The cinematography is as crisp as can be, and just as atmospheric (occasionally more so) as the first film. The presence of a score this time around works well, although the first film is just as notable for its ability to be just as dramatic without a score.The story in Bride of Frankenstein is much more sprawling and epic than in the first film. That fact neither makes it better or worse, but pleasantly different compared to Frankenstein's relatively tight, almost claustrophobic plot (which is appropriate for the subject matter). While Karloff's zombie-like muteness from Frankenstein was perfect in that context, it makes sense to have him mature here, and provides for some fantastic scenes, such as his interaction with the blind hermit (O.P. Heggie). Whale also chose to be much more literal and straightforward with the ethical and religious subtexts of the plot, and this film is notable for the large amount of verbal and visual references to God and Christianity--the visual references include the monster being hoisted on a ""pole"" as if being crucified, the monster descending into a grave with a crucifix looming over him, and a crucifix over a bed upon which the camera lingers.I actually prefer to think of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein as two halves or a single film, and given their short running times, they can be viewed back to back in about two and a half hours. If you haven't seen either one yet, you owe it to yourself to watch them at least once.",The Bride of Frankenstein
102,TheUnknown837-1,"the first ""Frankenstein"" picture was merely a monster story; the vastly superior sequel is a dramatic, surprisingly moving opus that captures Mary Shelley's original vision",9,3 November 2009,"Although its opening ten minutes are melodramatic and a little ludicrous, the remainder of the running time of James Whale's science-fiction classic ""Bride of Frankenstein"" proves to not only be superior to its predecessor, but also a surprisingly moving and imaginative motion picture which explores Frankenstein's monster the way that Mary Shelley had originally intended when she conceived of the creature for her novel long before.The original 1931 film also starring Boris Karloff as the monster and Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein, sparred and still spars controversy because there's very little resemblance between it and Mary Shelley's Gothic novel. The original film was based more on a stage production of the same name. So for the sequel, now that Whale had further backing from the studio, he decided to more or less take the material from the book that was left out for the original film and incorporate it with a new story to make a worthy sequel. And he did.The film picks up almost immediately where the first one ended. Dr. Frankenstein turns out to be alive after being thrown from the burning windmill by his own creation, who then later turns out to have survived the collapse of the mill and is on a new rampage throughout the country. The movie focuses on two stories. The monster and its excursions and Dr. Frankenstein's acquaintance with another discovery-hungry scientist (Ernest Thesiger), who has also stumbled upon a way to instill life into the dead.I personally am not the biggest fan of the original 1931 ""Frankenstein"", so I had not so high hopes for ""Bride of Frankenstein."" Its ostentatious opening did not really boost up my spirits, but I was delighted to see how moving and beautiful and poignant the film became afterward. For once I felt sympathy for the monster. Boris Karloff is no longer simply waving his arms about and grunting, but he's displaying a wide variety of emotions that were described in the original book, such as this very moving and classic scene where he befriends a blind hermit while being hunted. I was enthralled by Colin Clive's performance in the first movie, but he outdoes even that classic image in this sequel as the scientist who has learned from his mistake about playing God. Ernest Thesiger is also very good as the maniacal Dr. Pretorius. And the inclusion of a music score, more elaborate special effects, more characters, and a broader budget really boosted the results.In a way, the movie deserves a different title. Not only does ""Bride of Frankenstein"" sound ludicrous (and it's wrong, since it's the monster who desires a bride, not Frankenstein), but the whole subject of the monster's bride has very little to do with the story. If I had the nerve to re-title a classic, I would pick something more appropriate for this film, but nevertheless, it doesn't detract away from my enjoyment levels.I still say that the first ""Frankenstein"" picture is an overrated film, but its sequel is more than worthy of its title as a classic. I started out rolling my eyes, but ended up being really absorbed by the story. For it's not only about the monster rampaging or Frankenstein going mad.",The Bride of Frankenstein
103,gftbiloxi,One of the Great Classics of the Genre,10,8 April 2005,"Interestingly, Whale did not want to make a sequel to his incredibly successful 1931 FRANKENSTEIN, and bowed to studio pressure only when he received assurance of absolute control. The result is perhaps his most personal film--a strange collage of Gothic horror, black humor, religious motifs, and sexual innuendo--and one of the great classics of the genre.The plot elaborates an idea contained in the Mary Shelly novel: Frankenstein is pressured to create a mate for the monster. In Shelly's novel, the doctor eventually balks; in the film, however, he sees the experiment through due to a mix of his own obsession and the manipulations of a new character, Dr. Pretorious, and the two create the only truly iconographic female monster in the film pantheon of the 1930s horror film: ""The Bride,"" brilliantly played by Elsa Lanchester.The cast is excellent throughout, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff repeating their roles and Frankenstein and the monster, and Valerie Hobson an able replacement for Mae Clarke in the role of Elizabeth; Ernest Thesiger and Una O'Connor also give incredibly memorable performances as the truly strange Pretorius and the constantly hysterical maid Minnie. The art design is remarkable, and the Waxman score is justly famous. But the genius of the film lies not so much in these new and bizarre characters, in the familiar ones, or in the production values: it is in the way in which Whales delicately balances his elements and then subverts them.FRANKENSTEIN owes much of its power to its directness--it has a raw energy that is difficult to resist, still more difficult to describe. But THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN owes its power to its complexity. Nothing here is quite what it appears to be, and throughout the film we constantly receive mixed messages about the characters and implications of their situations. While Thesiger's Dr. Pretorius is justly celebrated as a covert gay icon of the darkest possible variety, and while many people quickly grasp Whale's often subversive use of Christian imagery, the film has many, many layers that do not reveal themselves upon a single viewing.The single most startling sequence, at least to my mind, is the famous scene in which the Monster stumbles into the lonely cottage of the blind hermit, a role beautifully played by O.P. Heggie. On the surface, the sequence would seem to be about how cruelly we judge people by appearances, and how true kindness can lift the fallen. It was not until I had seen the film several times that it dawned upon me that Whale has essentially endowed the a scene with a host of covertly homosexual overtones--and then tied them to a series of Christian elements for good measure. It is startling, to say the least.The current Universal DVD release is exceptional, and the film is supported with an interesting documentary and a still more interesting audio commentary track. Critics and fans continue to battle of whether FRANKENSTEIN or THE BRIDE is the better film--but I say they are so completely different that the question simply doesn't arise. Whatever the case, if you are a fan of 1930s horror and James Whale in particular, this is a must own see, must own.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Bride of Frankenstein
104,SanteeFats,Good one,8,8 September 2013,"Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the ""Bride"" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.",The Bride of Frankenstein
105,khanbaliq2,The wildest and most audacious of James Whale's 1930s horror films.,10,2 September 2010,"Bride Of Frankenstein is an extraordinary film, with sharp humour, macabre extravagance, and a narrative that proceeds at a fast, efficient pace. Baron Frankenstein is blackmailed by Doctor Septimus Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) into reviving his monster (Boris Karloff) and building a mate (Elsa Lanchester) for it.Frankenstein (1931) was startlingly good in a primitive way; this sequel is the screen's sophisticated masterpiece of black comedy, with all the talents working deftly to one end. Every scene has its own delights, and they are woven together into a superb if wilful cinematic narrative which, of its gentle mocking kind, has never been surpassed.",The Bride of Frankenstein
106,jluis1984,Monsterpiece!,10,13 December 2005,"James Whale's sequel to his ""Frankenstein"" is probably the perfection of his work in horror films. Everything he had been mastering since ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and in ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) collides here to create his masterpiece of the genre.With almost the same cast including Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Boris Karloff as the creature, Whale takes us to a mythical world where gods and monsters are alive and temptation can be deadly.Loosely based in the rest of the novel by Mary Shelley, the movie is a perfect mixture of the Gothic horror of the source story, as well as the cynic dark humor of James Whale. It is a perfect balance between horrid images and campy dark cynicism.Starting with an introductory scene with the Shelleys and Lord Byron as Mary continues her story, the movie takes us to where the first one ended, and we realize that the Monster is very alive and on the loose, in his search for understanding.Enter Dr. Pretorious, as an admirer of Frankenstein's work, he is decided to create his very own creature for his evil purposes; but first he must convince Henry to work with him. The creation will be a female version of the monster, since Pretorious has convinced the creature that all he needs is a partner.The acting is superb, with the addition of Elsa Lanchaster in a double role as Mary Shelley herself, and Pretorious' creation; Ernest Thesinger as Dr. Pretorious clearly steals the show as the mad scientist who tries to change the world. His performance makes us to be both horrified and attracted to him. He is the Mephisto of Frankenstein, a seducing tempter whose only concern is his own good.Whale's Direction is outstanding and the expressionist influence is notable through the film, giving it a very special look that sets the mood for the story.A masterpiece in its own right, this movie is a MUST see. There is nothing much I could add, except that this one is in my TOP 5 movies of all time. 10/10",The Bride of Frankenstein
107,juliankennedy23,Bride of Frankenstein... Save the Whales,8,16 July 2009,"Bride of Frankenstein: 8 out of 10: Bill Condon's Gods and Monsters certainly has made a viewing of the Bride of Frankenstein de-rigueur in certain intellectual (read gay) circles.While there is undoubtly some homosexual subtext in Bride, and one definitely is hard pressed to find a campier villain than Ernest Thesige's Dr. Pretorius, the reality is this is simply one of the best films of the 1930's even without the revisionist, gay old time slant.James Whale has created a tight, must see movie that cemented Boris Karloff's well deserved stardom. It also introduced special effects that are shocking for the early thirties and are still impressive today, Dr. Pretorius's Homunculi in particular.The picture is quite theatrical with great indoor sets used to great effect. I can see the influence on everything from Dark City to the Matrix.As must see for film fans and amateur historians alike, The Bride of Frankenstein comes highly recommended.",The Bride of Frankenstein
108,The_Movie_Cat,"""Woman... friend... wife...""",8,10 January 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSBride of Frankenstein is perhaps the centrepiece of any argument between whether a sequel can equal or better it's original. The two James Whale Frankenstein movies are often drawn open to debate, with large numbers of critics citing the second work. Occasionally a dissenting voice, such as Barry Norman, may be heard, who prefer the 1931 vehicle, but generally Bride is favoured.I have to agree wholeheartedly. When Bride opens with a tracking long shot, which then fades to a midshot, it's clear how vastly improved Whale's direction had become, how much more confident and assured. The climax, starting from the stark black and white of the bride herself, is first-class in execution. The original Frankenstein (6) has been justly praised as the most important horror film ever made, a movie without which the genre would never have reached widespread popularity. That's undeniably true, but taken on it's own terms as a film, it's perhaps somewhat lacking. Where the wonderful operatic sets and shadows have a splendidly European feel, the flatness of the direction means it always seems two-dimensional. The outdoor scenes recreated in a studio are so fake that you can see the stretch marks on the painted backdrop, and the cuts between shots are so poorly initiated that the monster's hands can be up, beckoning, one second, or face down the next. Look out too for Maria's teleporting cat, which manages to leap a foot in a split second. These aren't jumps in the film, just poor continuity. More Ed Wood than James Whale, the film concludes with a credit that reads ""A good cast is worth repeating..."" Though as that cast includes the wooden Mae Clarke and stiff John Boles, wouldn't it have been funny if it had continued ""...But this isn't a good cast, so we won't bother""? Frankenstein also cries out for a musical score, something it's successor had in abundance.Yet it's not just in presentation that Bride betters it's former, but in literary merit, (a prologue acknowledges Byron and Shelley, while the dialogue is infinitely more intricate) and satire. It's also hysterically funny, something which might be lost on a first-time audience expecting pure horror. Could only a flamboyant homosexual have directed Bride? Certainly the unintentional campness of the first is here converted into self-parody, way ahead of its time. Ernest Thesiger plays Dr. Pretorius, described as a ""very queer-looking"" old gentleman, with mincing relish. Valerie Hobson is just as wooden as Clarke in taking on the role of Elizabeth, but then maybe this time around that's the whole point.Whereas the original glossed over the science of it's monster in favour of $10,000 in flashing lights, Bride gives a more graphic depiction. With scenes devoted to the beating of a disembodied heart, only the humour present can glean past such potentially gory subtexts. The monster is placed into a Christ analogy, while 38 minutes in he's allowed to cry. A minute later and he's shown to be talking, taught basic words by a blind man. Only these two characters are allowed poignancy in the film. The joy they share in each other's company  ""I shall look after you, and you shall comfort me""  is seen, along with the bride's rejection, as another of Whale's assaults on heterosexual values. It's a reasonable argument, though as the only survivors are Frankenstein and Elizabeth, in each other's arms, it's perhaps stretching the point a little... 8/10.",The Bride of Frankenstein
109,jem132,A sequel that actually improves on it's predecessor,9,25 June 2008,"The element that, for me, is most interesting and impressive about James Whale's ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is it's humour. Whale also directed the original, and here he seems to be in more of a tongue-in-cheek mood, amping up the campy weirdness at every turn. The addition n of Henry Thesiger as mad scientist Dr Pretorious is one of the film's huge pluses, with the actor stealing every scene he is in. Colin Clive returns as Frankenstein, and he even gets to do his ""It's alive!"" scene again when the Bride is created, but a lot of other things have changed for him. For one, his wife is still Elizabeth but she is now played by brunette English actress Valerie Hobson instead of the blonde, American Mae Clarke. The set used for Frankenstein's house is completely different. Yet Whale never bats an eye at the strangeness, taking the tale up another notch by having Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) frame the tale with her imaginings of what came next for her characters. It's great fun, has a great script and is a heck of an entertaining ride, but is also very poignant. Why? One word. Karloff.Karloff again reprises his role as the Monster, and even if the great actor thought speech would mar his indelible film creation, he was wrong. The Monster only speaks a few words, but they are well-chosen. Once again the misunderstood Prometheus searches for kinship, and he finds a friend in a blind man, a fellow outcast (Alone...bad. Friend...good!). However, his companionship is short-lived and he seeks a mate from Frankenstein who is just as botched as him. Enter The Bride (Lanchester again)....",The Bride of Frankenstein
110,killercharm,Better than the original,6,7 September 2020,"Horror sequel that is better than the prequel, Frankenstein. This story of a woman built as a friend for the monster is a wonder of horror. The stark b&w film with so much in the shadows. The look of the bride, which is as iconic as the monster himself.

111,elvircorhodzic,It all starts and ends with Karloff.,7,14 April 2016,"I am not thrilled with the continuation of the cult horror. My expectations were not high. The director is an average story tried to upgrade originality, controversy and some form of horror. I certainly welcome the idea and I think it is in large part succeeded. If you watch the film as a kind of fun, it's more than good. I would describe the story as a kind of game where things are a bit turned upside down. This is not so bad, but must admit that at times acts illogical and boring. I would like to praise the diversity of access roles. Karloffs monster acts realistic, emotional and subtle. But acting, compared to the previous film, not better. Thesiger as Dr. Pretorious is the biggest villain, but in some sequences and its role can not be interpreted so. Elsa Lanchester is interesting because she plays two characters. Director covers this fact with a ""mystical scarf"". Clive and Hobson fit well and their agony was only extended. Una O'Connor exhilarating with specific speech, expression and screaming.I think that the director and the writers were aware of the success of the original. The effort is inevitable, but passing the idea is obvious.The film is strangely exciting, effects are great and the scenery is very good. Dealing with constant forms of censorship contributed to an atmosphere in which little attention was given to the actual values. The film is controversial, but only that it is acceptable.Sequel of the cult horror film well worth seeing.",The Bride of Frankenstein
112,Son_of_Mansfield,Masterpiece.,10,18 March 2006,"Frankenstein is a classic as well, but Bride betters it's parent by adding a haunting soundtrack, better supporting characters, and odd shots of humor, the same formula that James Cameron used when he made sequels to Terminator and Alien. The defining addition is the Franz Waxman soundtrack. This is a prototype for Danny Elfman type soundtracks and the biggest reason why Bride of Frankenstein is placed above it's predecessor by many. James Whale wisely up the humor with the lisping Ernest Thesiger, Frankenstein's goofy maid(her silly reaction to the creation's appearance is beaten only by the Brides sneering), and the fetching Elsa Lanchester, whose theme is one of the many highlights of the soundtrack. Boris Karloff's humane portrayal of Frankenstein's creation returns to cast his large shadow that no one has ever stepped out of as does Colin Clive as the weary Dr. Frankenstein. One of the greatest achievements of this film is the scene in the hut with the blind man, which goes from scary to touching to funny to sad in the space of a few minutes.P.S. The strangest thing about both films is their popularity, given that they are immensely unfaithful to Mary Shelley's text, but both films are have so much going for them that they have become a separate entity.*The Creation ""Frankenstein made me from dead. I love the dead, hate living.""*",The Bride of Frankenstein
113,jdkraus,Above and beyond the average 1930s horror flick,10,31 January 2012,"The Bride of Frankenstein picks up from where the first Frankenstein movie left off (as told by author Mary Shelley). The monster survives the wood mill fire and once again goes on a rampage against the small town. Meanwhile, the mysterious Dr. Pretorious seeks to recruit Dr. Frankenstein for another unorthodox experiment—to make a bride for the monster. This all sounds of the likings of a typical, 1930s horror film. However, The Bride of Frankenstein is much more than just a horror flick.While the prequel focuses on a crazed scientist and the terror the monster unleashes, this film sheds a whole new light on the monster. The Frankenstein monster is depicted as a child rather than a relentless murderer. When people scream at him, he does not know how to react. As a result, many of the people he kills are either by accident or in self-defense. The monster is also misunderstood. In one scene, he jumps into a pond with the intent of saving a young woman from drowning. As soon as she screams, nearby bystanders see him as attacking her rather than saving her. From this misinterpretation of the townspeople, the monster becomes a hapless victim. The only person he finds any solace in is an old blind hermit that lives in the forest. Not being able to see what the monster looks like, he takes him in with open arms. This really defines irony. Though the hermit cannot literally see the monster, he sees what is beneath the disfigured bulk, a lost, tormented soul that seeks friendship. Their first encounter is a very moving scene; in particular as the hermit professes to God in that he has ""brought two of thy lonely children together."" Both shed tears, revealing their unconditional joy of finding a friend one another. Additional power that relies in this moment is an orchestrated version of Ave Maria. It is subtle; yet present enough to build more emotion in such a pivotal part of the film. The scene that follows is touching. The hermit teaches the monster how to talk, smoke cigars, drink wine, and even identify what is good or bad. I will note that it is humorous to watch as the monster speaks, for his words are rudimentary and slowly delivered like the alien in Spielberg's E.T. Even so, this is a newly changed monster. He is more human than creature.It is interesting that this movie is titled The Bride of Frankenstein. The bride does not appear until the last ten minutes of the movie. When the monster does receive his bride, she shrieks at him, terrified. His bride proves that love and friendship cannot be created in a lab. Friendships are made by individuals who can accept you for who you are, not what you look like. That is an essential theme to this movie. There is always a friend out there for every person and often times, the people you friend is not necessarily someone you would imagine. These hidden messages are the reasons why I enjoy this movie. Beneath all of the makeup, Boris Karloff does a phenomenal job with delivering emotion. He makes the appropriate gestures and expressions to prove the monster as a sympathetic individual. The visual effects are simply astounding, especially when Dr. Pretorious presents Dr. Frankenstein with miniature persons in lab jars. The fact that the filmmakers could splice two scenes of film together into one without looking blurry or fake is incredible. The cinematography has a lot of German Expressionism, which is perfectly suited for this film. This is noteworthy in the sequence where the bride of Frankenstein is brought to life. The deep shadows, tilted camera angles, chiaroscuro lighting, and montage provide a haunting yet memorable sequence that still bores into my mind. In my concluding opinion, The Bride of Frankenstein is more than just an average 1930s horror flick. With a great performance by Karloff, sublime production, and a witty story full of messages, this movie goes down as a classic!",The Bride of Frankenstein

Balderston, Josef Berne, Lawrence G. Blochman, Tom Reed, R.C. Sheriff.Audiences adored ""Frankenstein"", Universal's successful horror film based on Mary Shelley's classic tale of horror. Boris Karloff won instant Hollywood fame as the Frankenstein monster and this would become his signature role despite taking on many other horror roles. Because the first Frankenstein film was such a hit, it soon became clear to Universal Studios that they should make a franchise and series of horror films with recurring characters and monsters. These would go on to include Dracula (portrayed by both Bela Lugosi and Lon Cheney) Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Mummy and The Invisible Man. This is an unauthorized sequel since Mary Shelley had nothing to do with writing it and it's purely the work of Hollywood writers. Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) turns out not to have died in the mill the angry mob set fire to. They believe they destroyed the Monster but it becomes gradually apparent that the monster is alive and well. He runs a muck and begins his killings in the German forests, scaring off his first victim (Una O'Connor in a hilarious role) who warns others that she has seen the monster with her own eyes come back from the dead. In one early scene, he spies a beautiful shepherdess (Anne Darling) and he attacks her in what is almost visually a near-rape-scene. The monster is soon out of control but only the violin music of a blind man and hermit (O.P. Heggie) has the power to soothe the monster and puts him on a hypnotic and tranquil state. Dr. Frankenstein abandons his wife and citizen's duty once again, enamored with his power to create life. He discovers that another scientist has created ""miniature life"" through a combination of strong magic and science. The mad scientist has his work cut out for him again. This time, discovering that all Frankenstein really wants is a mate, he sets out to create a Bride for him. She is made up of dead body parts like Frankenstein with a human female brain. She is beautiful but strange and upon seeing Frankenstein she is repulsed by him. Frankenstein, feeling his first heartbreak, decides to end his life and hers. This would have been a strongly romantic and tragic story if the horror/mystery element wasn't so heavy and in the audience's faces. In 1935, the Hays Code did not permit too much violence, not even in horror films and looking at these types of movies, they were nothing more than heavy Gothic melodrama with more mystery than horror. Audiences scared more easily. This sequel to Frankenstein has been considered the best in the Frankenstein series but I thought it was too slow-moving and lacked enough suspense and thrills and chills to make it a good horror film. The best in the series is the original Frankenstein and the last Frankenstein film -""Ghost of Frankenstein"". ""Bride"" has its moments and what most people remember is Elsa Lanchester's memorable get-up as the Bride, with that high-piled hairdo and her bloodcurdling scream. But really Elsa Lanchester is not doing any real acting as she appears only two times, first as Mary Shelley the Victorian novelist entertaining guests with her stories and then as the Bride who cannot speak but can sure scream her head off. Frankenstein is able to talk (Boris Karloff's voice) and he appears to be very human and intelligent. Apparently, this did not catch on and in the other movies he's back to being just a growling and stupid killing machine. Colin Clive hams it up again as the ambitious mad scientist. Another wonderful aspect of the movie is the music by veteran Hollywood film composer Franz Waxman (he would do the music to ""Sunset Boulevard"" among his many film scores). Waxman creates an atmosphere of eerie mystery and Gothic beauty and even romance. It's too bad the movie moves too slowly and has very little to offer save for visual grandeur. But this is a favorite of many horror film fans and a definite classic.",The Bride of Frankenstein
115,Prichards12345,"""To a new world of Gods and Monsters!""",10,27 June 2010,"Bride of Frankenstein is the 4th and final horror movie from director James Whale. Seeking to top his previous efforts Whale pulled out all the stops and Universal gave him an increased budget and total creative freedom to produce what many feel may be his masterpiece.The movie opens with the famous prologue at the Villa Diodati, with Lord Byron, Shelly and Mary Wollstonecraft discussing Frankenstein; Mary awaiting its eventual publication. Whale created a film full of dualism, Mary is played by Elsa Lanchester, who of course later on appears as the bride of the monster; but we also have Colin Clive's tortured Frankenstein contrasted with Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) and his wife Elizabeth - who is actually the titular bride - another Whale in-joke to deliberately confuse the monster with his creator.We quickly learn the monster (Boris Karloff) has survived the fire at the end of the first movie, and Whale, deliberately trying not to simply repeat Frankenstein, shows the monster developing, learning of his creator and being taught to speak by a blind hermit (O.P. Heggie.) Eventually the creature comes across Dr. Pretorius robbing the grave of a young woman; having already tried to get Frankenstein on board to create a mate for the monster, he now uses him to kidnap Elizabeth and force Frankenstein to help him.Whale's eccentric personality is given full reign here. In truth, the story does not quite hang together, being decidedly uneven. The genius is in the handling, however, from Whale's sly attack on religion to the black humour and finally the brilliantly constructed creation sequence, which comes off as a spoof of the wedding ceremony; Whale never loses his footing. The acting is top notch by all concerned,although Una OConnor's servant unbalances several scenes and grates on the ear. The star of the film is undoubtedly Thesiger, virtually inventing ""Camp"" and delivering a wonderfully fruity performance.Horror fans who prefer the stark and powerful first movie may sniff at the sequel; but this is a brilliant and distinctive work of imagination, humour and horror.

If we didn't have the prejudice toward the horror genre it would be on every critics list of greatest achievements in film. It is one of the few movies that deserves the all too often thrown around title of masterpiece. You can't praise James Whales' Bride of Frankenstein enough.Bride of Frankenstein is a movie where everything connects together perfectly. The cast, the direction, and the set design are perfect.If there is one film that rises Karloff above your typical bogeyman and cements him as one of the all time greats it would be Bride of Frankenstein. His ""monster"" is one of the most tragic characters in cinema. Karloff objected to giving the monster dialogue but his objections were ill founded, his performance here is Academy Award worthy. The Monsters dialogue gives insight into a dark and desperately lonely soul. He isn't very articulate in his speech but it's more effective that he isn't. His simple speech offers glimpses into a variety of human emotions and how they can effect anyone. The monster make-up works very well with Karloff's face and his facial expressions are outstanding as well. The scene where tears sprout from the Monster's scarred face is heartbreaking. This creature is anything but a monster, he is someone who longs to be understood and loved.Ernest Thesiger is a show stealer as the villainous Pretorius. He lacks any morality whatsoever and is the personification of the devious side of ambition. Thesiger's Pretorius is the most effective deliver of the movie's dark humor. He delivers the lines in a very dry way unlike the vocal Una O Conor and EE Clive. You can't help but let out a devilish smirk with Pretorius as he gives the iconic line ""To a new world of Gods and Monsters"" Colin Clive is sad to watch in this film. You can tell he is in pain both physically and mentally. He doesn't seem to be as alert in the delivery of his lines and his face shows signs of his alcoholism. That being said his performance is all the more admirable considering his hardships.Elsa Lanchester gives a brief but iconic performance as the Bride. Jack Pierce deserves credit for another job well done, she looks nothing like her attractive counterpart Mary Shelley in the film's introduction.Bride of Frankenstein has been called the essential film to look at when you want to see a director's personality. Well if this is true James Whale would have been someone I would have liked to have had a chat with. The movie is so bizarre and so different from the other pictures of the 30's. I wasn't a huge fan of the Ian McKellan bio Gods and Monsters simply because I felt it did Whale a great injustice by trying to over simplify Whale by saying he was a non-conformist homosexual in a conservative society.

I believe I'm right in saying that the monster himself needs no introduction, as most people are familiar with the first movie that was made in 1931. This movie is essentially a sequel to that one, and involves the monster escaping a fire after he is attacked by villagers. He starts killing people and causing mayhem again, and something must be done to calm him down. The monster's creator, Henry Frankenstein, meets up with an old friend of his named Dr. Pretorius and talks to him about some important things, and Pretorius alludes to creating a female companion for the abomination. Boris Karloff as the monster once again hits the ball out of park, and somehow manages to do even better than the first movie because he gives the character more personality that he never had before. In one scene, the monster comes across a house where a hermit lives all by himself. The hermit is blind, so he has no idea he's conversing with a dangerous monster, but he shows him how to do different things anyway. He gives him food, plays music for him, and even gives him a cigar at one point which I thought I would never see. This is probably one of the only times the monster appears friendly. Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic. Dr. Pretorius finally manages to complete the monster's bride in a castle, and a bolt of electricity is harnessed to provide life force for her body. After she sees the monster, she screams in horror, and Frankenstein (the monster) is bluntly rejected. Realizing that everybody is afraid of him, he allows his creator to leave the castle while he flips a switch that destroys the castle, killing himself, his bride, and Pretorius. The movie is still really good, and you must watch it if you like horror, but the title ""Bride of Frankenstein"" seems misleading because she only appears in the last 5 or so minutes.

Miniature actors in the jar, talking and acting; seemingly innovative science instruments; the idea itself of bringing the dead alive; and make-up and costumes to create almost real monster.There were some brilliant scenes and imageries as well. The scene where Henry and Doctor Pretorius create female monster is amazing. All the lightings and sparks contrast to darkness of the room. Especially, the lighting from below make two more grotesque and death-like. The sound of electricity and heartbeat add more suspense and mystery to that scene. (I gotta tell you. Sound is way better in old films because it was the period right after silent film in which the sound had to tell the whole story.)Crucifix image in the tomb and the position that female monster lies keep reminding the theme of the movie, brining the dead alive. The monster is somewhat baptized when he meets hermit, eating bread and wine and learning what is 'good'.

Bordering on ""camp"" at some points, but always on ""message,"" ""The Bride.."" features several holdovers from the earlier film. Colin Clive, as stiff an actor as you'll ever find, returns as the Monster's creator, Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Boris Karloff, of course, reprises his role as the Monster, but this time learns how to speak with the help of O.P. Heggie as the blind hermit. Their relationship in this film has been the subject of debate for years due to Whale's own sexual preference. Karloff's ""Monster"" has a rough go of it throughout the proceedings and the mad scientist (even madder than Dr. Frankenstein) Dr. Pretorius doesn't improve matters for him one bit. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) is portrayed as perverted, cynical and unscrupulous (and possibly Jewish) and his own experiments have to be seen to be believed. His chief goal is for Dr. Frankenstein to assist him in making a mate for Karloff so that they can create their own ""race."" That sounds like a great idea on paper, but doesn't translate as well in the laboratory. The mate turns out to be the most frightening and distinctively weird female image in the history of cinema. At first glance, she and Karloff look somewhat close to a match made in heaven, but their ""relationship"" goes to hell in a hand-basket faster than you can say ""I do."" It seems she doesn't like his ""appearance."" She obviously hasn't looked in the mirror herself lately. Before this love match takes place, Karloff is subjected to one abuse after another from the townsfolk, from the police, and from a few shots from John Carradine's rifle. In one scene, an angry mob drapes Karloff over a cross and director Whale exhibits him as almost a Christ-like figure. Between that scene and a host of others, there's enough implied imagery and symbolism in this film to keep a team of psychoanalysts busy. As for the rest of the cast, Valerie Hobson plays Henry's wife Elizabeth, replacing Mae Clarke from the first film. She's better looking but not much of an improvement in the acting category. Veteran Una O'Connor provides some much-needed comic relief as the idiotic ""Minnie."" It's a role she could do in her sleep. Dwight Frye (the lunatic Renfield in 1931's ""Dracula"") has a small but effective part as a gravedigger. Lastly, Elsa Lanchester is the ""Bride"" of the title and also appears as author Mary Shelley in the film's brief prologue. According to her associates, Lord Byron and Percy Shelley, little Mary has a lot of explaining to do. With some minor prodding, she soon gets the film rolling as she begins her ""sequel"" to the story. Without grading her on a curve, Ms. Shelley definitely deserves an A+ for originality.",The Bride of Frankenstein
125,skybrick736,The Bride of Frankenstein,5,11 March 2015,"The Bride of Frankenstein (5/10) would definitely be on my list as one of the more over-hyped horror movies' that is widely agreed and ranked as one of the top horror films by critics. Bride of Frankenstein scratched many of its unsettling themes used in the original by making a more comical mood. I thought placing Una O'Connor's character as a major role, as eccentric caretaker Minnie, was a big mistake. Her cheesy lines, along with many others lines, were way too cornball. The writing and storyline had flaws as well, disconnecting the viewer from the flow of the movie. When the film does introduce The Bride, fantastically played by Elsa Lanchester, the film finally displayed some redeeming qualities. Boris Karloff and Colin Clive also saved a potential disaster by successfully returning their role as The Monster and Dr. Frankenstein. It may sound like I hated The Bride; the case is I thoroughly enjoyed it as part of the Frankenstein series but believe it is definitely overrated.",The Bride of Frankenstein

The result is his masterpiece, and sees Boris Karloff (given top billing as just Karloff) return as the Monster, this time with dialogue. Colin Clive reprises his role as Doctor Frankenstein, forced into helping his former mentor Doctor Septimus Pretorious (the wonderfully flamboyant Ernest Thesiger and his experimental miniature royal family), with his experiments which include re-animating the corpse of Elsa Lanchester as a bride for his original creation. With her vertical hairdo complete with vertical lightning bolts (the makeup was created by Jack Pierce, whom Lanchester hated working with) she became an iconic symbol of both the character and the film, and actually has two roles within the movie, appearing at the start as Mary Shelley.

Bride of Frankenstein is just as good as the original film, and maybe even a bit better. I do not hesitate in saying that it the best sequel ever made. I would recommend seeing the original film first, but you will have to see this one once you do.Colin Clive is the greatest actor that has ever played Dr. Frankenstein and Boris Karloff is the greatest actor that has ever played Frankenstein's monster so the cast is pure gold. I like the story of the first film better but this one is great too. The production is and everything else is also amazing. James Whale was a great director and one of my favorites of all time.

128,tforbes-2,More than a horror film,10,10 April 2016,"For me, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" excels as a film in general because it is more than a horror film. The humor is abundant, and we see real humanity in Boris Karloff's portrayal of the monster.And Elsa Lanchester is just simply great in her dual role as the Bride and in her other role as well. In the latter, you see how really beautiful she was.I was struck by how old looking Ernest Thesiger was in this film. He was only 56 years old, yet looked older than old. I remember him from his last role, 1961's ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone,"" which he must have filmed either at the end of 1960 or very beginning of 1961.

130,mlraymond,James Whale classic fantasy both hilarious and heartbreaking,10,30 October 2006,"Many people have complained that the mix of comedy and tragedy in this movie makes it too uneven to succeed completely. I almost agree, but it's possible that a more traditionally serious, straightforward movie, like the first Whale Frankenstein, might not have had as much impact without the contrast between the intentionally farcical, whimsical scenes, and the overwhelmingly sad scenes. This movie is unlike anything else to come out of old time Hollywood. It seems to be on the verge of becoming a spoof many times, only to stun the viewer with scenes of unbearably moving pathos. The art direction, cinematography, special effects, and of course, music, add up to nothing short of a masterpiece, all skillfully directed through the eccentric vision of James Whale. There is so much to praise in this movie that I will have to mention only a few great moments. SPOILERS AHEAD:When the gossipy, thrill-seeking Frankenstein family maid Minnie (Una O'Connor) turns around to see the hulking, mud-caked, burned Monster staring down at her by the burning ruins of the mill, and she lets out a series of little squeaks and yawps before running away shrieking, as the Monster (Karloff) stares curiously after her. This is followed by one of the funniest moments in all classic films, when the old lady tries to convince a cynical butler at the Frankenstein castle that the Monster is still alive, and he dismisses her as making up stories. Una O'Connor turns and stares directly into the camera ,and says to the audience, "" Nobody'll believe me! Well, I wash me hands of it! They can all be murdered in their beds, for all of me!"" The most famous sequence, gently parodied in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, has the Monster, wounded, terrified and exhausted, finding shelter at the forest cottage of a kindly blind hermit (O.P. Heggie). The scene is delicately balanced between comedy and pathos, as the clumsy, animalistic Monster is contrasted with the quiet, gracious old hermit. The sheer raw emotion of that scene is staggering, from the moment when the hermit and the Monster begin to communicate, and one feels the Monster's desperate, stifled need to reach out and be understood by someone. There is an indescribable beauty in the simple gesture of the hermit tenderly clasping the Monster's hand ,and humbly thanking God for "" bringing two of thy lonely children together"". The astonishing poignancy of the scene's ending, with the Monster awkwardly, but gently, patting the old hermit on the back ,as the old man breaks down and weeps for joy, is overwhelming. A single tear runs down the Monster's scarred cheek ,and the scene fades out. I have seen this movie with modern audiences more than once, and have never heard anyone laugh at that scene. The audience sat in awed silence, except for a hushed, ""Wow!"" from one viewer. The grave robbing scene with Praetorius and his reluctant assistants, his midnight picnic in the tomb, and casual offering of a cocktail to the Monster, the creation of the Bride herself and her unveiling, are all Whale at his best. The last word on this film I leave to Dwight Frye, the original hunchbacked assistant in Frankenstein, and Renfield, Dracula's fly-eating slave. When the coffin is opened, and the three body snatchers look at the skeleton of the young woman to be used in constructing the Bride, there is a pause, and then Frye remarks, in a weaselly rasp, "" Pretty little thing in her way, wasn't she?"" An absolute must for any devotee of classic Thirties horror movies, and possibly James Whale's finest hour.",The Bride of Frankenstein
131,tcchelsey,NOMINATED FOR BEST SOUND OSCAR???,10,17 October 2021,"Most film sequels DO NOT do justice to the original production, but there are definite exceptions, and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is one. BEST FILM OSCAR? NO. Instead it received a nomination for BEST SOUND! Of course, Oscar categories were scant back in the 1930s, outside of Best Film, Actor and Actress, however, let the record show that Frederic March did win an Oscar for DR. JEKYLL ANDF MR HYDE, just a few years earlier! Director James Whale , to his credit, made the most of his bizarre assignment and, rather ingeniously, made it a point to further develop the central characters, including the now iconic Monster, which would have a voice and a BRIDE! Incredible! And the story behind the scenes in making this classic horror exercise was just as intriguing. Mae Clarke was once again tapped to play Dr. Frankenstein's (Colin Clive) wife, however she had been involved in a serious car accident a year earlier, and was still on the mend, not to mention having suffered a nervous break down! The role went to the equally beautiful and talented Valerie Hobson, who had a very similar role that same year, in WEREWOLF OF LONDON, also produced by Universal. Then there was the problem with Colin Clive, who had a drinking problem, which was getting worse. Whale stood behind Clive, however, because he was the definitive DR. Frankenstein. Smart move, but not without a price. Some weeks into filming, Clive fell and broke his leg, and only to compound this, Karloff took a fall on the set and broke a few bones! Whale, the consummate professional, did his best to work around these setbacks. Then there's the story about Elsa Lancaster. Lancaster, who was married to Charles Laughton at the time, was offered the role of the BRIDE (and all that came with it!) because Whale was good friends with her husband. Laughton had starred in Whale's OLD DARK HOUSE in 1932. The story goes that Lancaster eagerly took the role, primarily to strengthen her career credits (and it certainly did), but she was no friend of legendary makeup man Jack Pierce! Just one big happy family. Lancaster reportedly had difficulty adjusting to Pierce, who in her words, was operating on her face like a real doctor, and to make matters worse, he dressed the part, completely in white! Somehow it all came together, although Whale ran over budget and over schedule, but it netted a handsome payout in the end, which is still paying dividends to this day! One additional footnote, and best saved for the last, described Whale's thoughtfulness for little Maria, played by child actress Marilyn Harris, whose character was killed by the monster in FRANKENSTEIN. Whale personally recruited Harris to return, and you may notice her as the lead child with a group of her peers, and additionally gave her some dialogue, albeit small, to guarantee her more money. About the same story revolves around British actor Ernest Thesiger, MEMORABLE, to say the least, as the ever eccentric Dr. Pretorious, Dr. Frankenstein's ""achilles heel"" in the flesh. Thesiger, also a friend of Whale's, was cast in a role that was written exclusively for his talents and, perhaps, a character that at times rivals the Monster, he is that fascinating to watch. Additional applause for Una O'Connor as the doctor's nerve-wracked maid (who was recruited from Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN). It is all here and more; the actors, the sets, the atmosphere, even the striking Franz Waxman music score, in a truly outstanding, if not improvisational, one for the books film that only improves with each select viewing. And, the truth now... How many of us big little kids at heart have seen it over and over again, huh? And DO NOT forget the Hermit! Need we saw more. Recommended, even for non movie buffs.",The Bride of Frankenstein
132,WalkdenEntertainment,Such A Classic Into The Monsters Universe!,8,10 January 2019,"Last week I decided to sit down and watch an classic old school Black and White film from my 'Monsters' box set on Bluray. This was a 1st watch for me- the film is so old it features a stereo audio track. Long before colour TV's and surround sound, in the year 1935, Universal Pictures were making horror monster films correctly. Especially when compared to the all modern recent attempts such as Dracula, The Mummy (Tom Crusie) & Van Helsing!Starting right off where we last left Frankenstein, the town celebrates the death of Frankenstein but at the same time, the town is also in mourning for the monster's creator ""Henry Frankenstein"", who also died while defeating the monster.
But!
Within a matter of minutes, we soon discover that both Frankenstein and Henry Frankenstein have survived and are alive! Henry Frankenstein returns to his soon to be wife and as for Frankenstein... well he begins to run and hide from the town all over again. Henry Frankenstein is shortly in discussions with an old friend and decides to once again to try to create another human. In fact, after learning from the mistakes last time, they can perhaps make a better human, or to better put it, a perfect creation who would be ""A Bride for Frankenstein"".Bride of Frankenstein is surprisingly unpredictable, in particular with it's ending. The entire film was shot in a film studio with clever use of stop motion and miniatures models.Needless to say, this film is a true classic of cinemas. I wouldn't mind if Hollywood wanted this film redone one day, but perhaps the studios should just keep it basic. A film like this reminds us that a good story is the strength of a film. We don't need cars flipping and helicopters crashing all the time in order to make a classic film come to life.7.8/10

133,ReelCheese,This Sequel Triumphs,9,5 September 2007,"Not even the most fastidious of contemporary filmgoers can refute the eternal brilliance of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, one of the silver screen's all-time classics and rightful possessor of a Top 200 place at IMDb.This sharp 1935 triumph is first and foremost a visual treat, with wonderfully inspired makeup and sets vividly beaming across our screens in glorious black and white; in fact, it is difficult to invoke another film where these two aspects have contributed so much. The use of more sets also gives the movie less of the stationary feel the original had. The sights create a decidedly creepy yet fun atmosphere as only old horror films can.But the makeup artists and set designers aren't alone in earning praise. Everyone involved with BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN did the unthinkable, particularly by 1930s standards, by improving upon what came before. This starts with star Boris Karloff (whose name actually appears in the credits, unlike the original, where he was secretively identified with a string of question marks.) As the monster stitched together from human remains in the original, Karloff conveyed as much raw emotion as possible from behind heavy rubber makeup. Here he's every bit as good, and the addition of limited dialog makes him even more of a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast, including Colin Clive (Dr. Frankenstein) and Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorious), don't miss a beat, and clearly had the right feel for the type of entertainment being created.And what can be said about legendary director James Whale? Universal's removing of his artistic shackles probably made the film what it is. In keeping with the more polished effort of this sequel compared to its predecessor, Whale outdid himself. His guidance ensured the finished product was smart and smooth, making the most out of the considerable talent surrounding him. He knew where the picture should go and exactly how it would get there.If there's one quibble some fans might have with BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, it is that the title character is barely present. Indeed Elsa Lanchester's skunk-striped monster does not appear until about the final two minutes, dashing hopes of a lengthy interaction between she and her male counterpart. But like many great directors before and (mainly) after him, Whale knew that the fun was in the build-up, not the execution. It would have been interesting, to say the least, to see more of the two together, but this by no means diminishes the film.It's been said before, but it deserves to be said again. BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is quite possibly the most stark example of a sequel outshining the original. It is a truly remarkable effort.",The Bride of Frankenstein
134,thenolanfan,A Masterpiece of Universal's Monster,9,2 May 2020,"According, to me it is the best movie of the ""Universal's Monster"" collection. The storytelling is definitely better than in other movies, I think that the sound helped, but also, it is focusing only on a short and very specific story. Also, I love how this movie remained faithful to the style of the previous movie without repeating the same thematic, this one is definitely more existential and sadder. It brings a strong and iconic scene where the Monster realizes that even the Bride hates him, you can see a tear on his eye before he pulls the switch. Also, it seems apparent that the whole crew and cat had fun while doing the movie, there is so many crazy credits, for me, it is a plus, it shows that a real artistic effort was put to make this movie unique and not simply another cash-making sequel.In conclusion, you shouldn't watch this movie only to complete the ""Universal's Monster"" collection. I recommend that you watch it simply because it is a very great movie, and personally because I think that it is better than the first installment.",The Bride of Frankenstein
135,happyendingrocks,"A magnificent, but not better, addendum to the original",8,29 October 2009,"While most people argue that Bride Of Frankenstein is superior to its predecessor, I'm inclined to disagree with that assessment. Yes, this is a fantastic film, and most assuredly a must-see for film scholars and casual fans alike. But, as with any sequel, the sense of familiarity makes the most gripping moments of Bride Of Frankenstein slightly less spectacular than they were when we saw them the first time out, and while the film succeeds as both a logical continuation of the original and as a high-water mark in Universal's already stellar classic horror canon, Bride simply doesn't capture the near-perfection of our first visit with Frankenstein.Many also consider this film a more faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's source novel, but that's not quite true either. Actually, Bride Of Frankenstein's main purpose is to bring to life the substantial bits of Shelley's novel that were omitted from the original film. Putting the two movies together gives a fairly inclusive, if chronologically skewed, overview of the salient elements of Shelley's classic text. Those who have never read the book will undoubtedly find the events in Bride a marvelous augmentation of the original Frankenstein, but for those already well-acquainted with the novel, this film simply fills in the blanks.Some may find the idea of the monster speaking to be a silly twist, but it's important to note that this was a major plot point in Shelley's original tale. The way it's handled here is actually an excellent representation of the source material, and the monster's time with the blind hermit in the woods is well-lifted straight from the text. While the ability to speak strips Karloff's lumbering giant of a bit of his menace, his verbalization of his need for companionship substantially furthers the exploration of the isolation and loneliness of the monster's existence that is so key to the story.The movie's preface is a bit over the top, and although it is a rather neat idea to allow Shelley herself to tell the rest of her tale, the foppish portrayals of Lord Byron and Percy Shelley have aged less gracefully than the rest of the film. While this works as a great device to set up a sequel, the factual inaccuracy of this segue may miff those who are approaching the film from a historical standpoint.In most respects, Bride functions as a straight-forward Part II, utilizing an approach that has been used in sequels since the dawn of cinema: namely, amplifying the most successful elements from the original film to substitute for the lack of surprises. In the case of Bride Of Frankenstein, this means more of Boris Karloff's legendary monster and more humor. Neither of these is a bad thing, and thanks to the strength of Una O'Connor's spirited performance, the funniest moments of Bride have held up admirably well. Ditto with Karloff's indelible creature, who remains an unforgettable and imposing screen presence. Karloff did magnificent things without saying a word in the original Frankenstein, but allowed the chance to add language to his portrayal, he's able to more ably summon the complexities and inner turmoil of the monster that are such a focal point in the text.Ernest Thesiger's Dr. Pretorius nearly steals the film on his own, even if our first glimpse of his experiments is bound to look clunky and dated to modern audiences. Though these effects aren't quite spectacular, the strength of Thesiger's performance is undeniable, and his shared obsession with Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein leads to some delightful interplay between the two.Of course, we can't fail to mention the Bride herself, Elsa Lanchester, whose stunning reveal nearly rivals the impact of Karloff's entrance in the original. Surely, the film-makers were reaching for a presence as iconic as Karloff's monster, and they definitely hit those lofty heights with Lanchester's unforgettable and all-too-brief turn as the monster's unwilling object of desire.The finale here is not only the climax of the film, but of the creature's entire quest for acceptance, and the tragedy of the monster's disturbed life is never more explicit than when he discovers that even the being built specifically to be his companion can not accept his monstrous existence. When our doomed lothario and his dismissive mate are seemingly destroyed, it is an epic, almost Shakespeare-ian last reel, and the monster's final words, ""we belong dead"", end the saga with a violent emotional punch that perfectly punctuates the sense of primal despondency Karloff's creature has carried throughout both films.Yet, none of this quite edges Bride ahead of the classic it follows. The repetition of powerful images from the previous film, including the monster throwing a hapless soul off the roof just as he did to Frankenstein in the original, ensures that Bride simply can't shock our senses as acutely as before. Even though Dr. Frankenstein's ecstatic ""She's alive!"" is a welcome and delightful twist on the precursor's most famous moment, it doesn't have the same lunatic zeal that shone so brightly the first time through. This is most assuredly a masterfully constructed piece, but it simply doesn't match the heady standard set for it.I honestly don't know why that matters, though. Anyone interested in either film should undoubtedly see both, as they are symbiotic extensions of each other. There really isn't any reason to argue, because once you watch Frankenstein and Bride Of Frankenstein, you win either way.",The Bride of Frankenstein
136,ultramatt2000-1,80 years and still awesome!,10,15 July 2015,"I heard about and read about. I finally saw it on SVENGOOLIE and I knew that it was one of those sequels that were better than the first film! Scenes from this movie were based on other elements from the Mary Shelly story, which also got spoofed in the Mel Brooks film, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974). My favorite character was Dr. Petoreus he is interesting and downright evil. He showed him his previous experiments which were shrunken people. That scene was contrasting because it was too comical. (In 1933, Universal was going to make an adaptation of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, but it didn't get made, so this scene answers the question on what if the story got adapted.) This movie also has background music that was perhaps, an attempt to cash-in on the success of the original KING KONG. Before KONG got made, there were a lot of horror films that did not rely on background music and just silence. As the expression goes ""Silence is Golden"", but sometimes it can be unsettling and disturbing to build terror. It worked with two Universal horror films like Dracula and FRANKENSTEIN, and Paramount's ISLAND OF LOST SOULS. The Bride is as iconic as her male counter-part, her Hammer iteration from FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN, lacked the charm and it looked too attractive and less scary. So kudos to this movie, although it is a success, causing UNIVERSAL to make DRACULA'S DAUGHTER, this movie got a bad case of sequelitis causing them to make more sequels like SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN and FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN (which caused them to crossover with Dracula). I highly recommend it so give it a watch. Not rated, but it is best off for children ages 7 and up to watch it with their parents.",The Bride of Frankenstein
137,frankwiener,The Real Monster Gets Away Again,7,6 October 2019,"From the beginning, a fearful atmosphere of foreboding is established as the Shelleys gather with their pal, Lord Byron, before the fire on a frightfully stormy night and as Mary Shelley, the creator of ""Frankenstein"", explains that the true monster of her design is a man who would arrogantly attempt to imitate God. Byron is skeptical that Mary's horror stories will ever be published, but she is confident that readers seek an alternative to the fancy, flowery verse of her male companions. She was right and never even had to change her name to George in order to to gain success as a female writer who wrote outside of the romance genre in the early nineteenth century.Even after many viewings since my childhood, which was many, many years ago, I am still as frightened of Karloff's character as I was way back then. The important scene in the blind hermit's house reveals to what extent the Frankenstein ""monster"" longs to be accepted by a world of which he never asked to be a part, by a ""human"" race among which he involuntarily found himself to no fault of his own. Only a blind man could tolerate him without experiencing revulsion from his horrifying physical appearance. This is the true tragedy of ""Frankenstein"", and, if the situation weren't bad enough, the deranged decision of concocting a mate for him makes his plight even more wretched. In his final act of compassion, the ""monster"" demonstrates how much more human he is than the so-called ""humans"" around him by releasing Dr. and Mrs. Frankenstein from certain, violent death. Under the circumstances, does the true, egomaniacal monster, Dr. Frankenstein, deserve such kind consideration?As usual, Una O'Connor is over the top with her hideous shrieking, which constantly competes with the monster for bloodcurdling effect. Although this is a good horror movie for its time with many memorable and scary moments from director James Whale and from Mr. Karloff, claims by reviewers that it is ""the greatest horror film of all time"" is a bit of a stretch for me.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Another thing you think while watching it is why the heck did they even make this, it was better before. The story could have helped that but it is not very good at all and is way to similar to the originals. The screenplay is similarly weak with bad dialogue and no character development. And who decided that Frankenstein was going to talk because I feel like hurting him. The performances are also bad and the direction is nothing special, but the visual effects save the day.

140,r-c-s,good silver screen era classic,8,4 November 2005,"we can say a lot about this movie and in comparison with other (later) movies...yet this was among the few ones setting the pace for decades to come...when special effects (from Coppola's Dracula, to Vamp, to near dark etc ) and gore were not necessarily the winning edge when it'd come to a good film. This film tries to convey a clear & cut message: probing the secrets of life & death is bad & comes with adequate retribution; human beings cannot be judged according to mistakes they did not make; violence causes more violence (eg the monster is rather innocuous by himself & becomes understandably violent only when confronted with violence & hate ), etc. There is the attempt to understand what goes on diagonally, rather than horizontally. Overall a good crafted movie with good acting moments (EG doctor Pretorius) and bad acting moments ( eg that Una O'Connor & her hysterical, cardboard roles. I mean, see her once, you've seen her for all ). All in all, the story, which looked so weird and outright sorcery only at that time, is today's reality with organ transplants and recent grotesque limb transplants... More so, most would find dr. F's obsession quite repulsive only back then, while it is today one of the celebrated frontiers of medicine (irrespective of the fact that in both cases, mid-long term success rates are negligible ). Of course Shelley ignored everything about genetics, rejection etc, but she wasn't writing a physiology book, either: the message fits perfectly today.

141,freaky_dave,Great achievement by an exceptional director,10,25 October 2006,"Bride of Frankenstein is an unusual film because it was one of the first sequels to match the original. James Whale, who directed the first, directs this one as well and allows himself to be more open about his sexuality then he was in the first.Yes James Whale was gay, and with this film he allows himself to not be as restrained as he was with the first film. The gay overtones are there, (expecially with the scenes involving the creature and the blind hermit that he befriends) but that doesn't at all make this film any less than a masterpiece. The visual look of the film was great, and the atmosphere was very befitting of such an old ageless monster film. It was more exciting then the original Frankenstein, but that was expected since the original was more of an origin story and only the first part of Mary Shelleys Frankenstein, the novel it was based upon. Bride is actually the second half of that novel brought to the screen, and it was a wonderful film for its time.The acting, once again, was top notch. In this film Karloff once again gives a great performance, making him the best actor in any of the roles involving the big three, which include The Wolf Man and Dracula. He is also given some lines to speak, and this only adds to the emotional quality of his performance. Colin Clive also returns as Henry Frankenstein, and he to is just as good as he was in the first. We have a few additional characters in the film which include Ernest Thesiger who plays Dr. Pretorious, O.P Heggie who plays the hermit, and of course Elsa Lanchester who plays the bride of the monster and also has a dual role at the beginning as Mary Shelley who tells the story. All of their performances were convincing and exceptionally well done.This films is one of the greatest art films ever made. It appears in the top lists of films by most critics and belongs there. Of all the monster movies and horror flicks, both Frankenstein and Bride Of Frankenstein will always end up at the top of most of those lists. Great achievements by a great director in his own right who used his real feelings to make one of the best cinematic masterpieces of all time.",The Bride of Frankenstein
142,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Better than its predecessor,7,12 April 2015,"It doesn't happen often that I think a sequel is better than its predecessor but this movie certainly is. Of course this movie couldn't be as good without the Frankenstein movie that came out 2 years earlier. I really liked how they started the movie with author of the novel Mary Shelley saying the story didn't end with the people burning the mill attempting to kill the monster. So the sage continues with the monster further creating havoc. They capture him but he escapes. He eventually meets a blind man who teaches him to speak and for the first time we see emotions in the creature. These are some of the finest scenes in the movies. Here the characters really show depth which they were lacking in the predecessor. Nice that both Boris Karloff and Colin Clive reprised their roles as the monster and Henry Frankenstein. Very nice was also the scene with the little people. The bride of Frankenstein is played by same actress who plays Mary Shelley in the beginning (Elsa Lanchester), excellent choice which I think is symbolic. She looks excellent, a pity she didn't have that much screen time.",The Bride of Frankenstein
143,erwan_ticheler,BEST HORROR EVER !,10,9 April 2001,"You don't get any better than this. Superb acting by Boris Karloff and Ernest Thesiger including superb directing by James Whale. Where everybody thought that the monster was dead, it comes back with a vengeance. Karloff plays the role of the monster with brilliance and makes it really scary, especially for that time (1935!). The monster even talks which gives the monster even more human aspects. Of course it can't live on, but that's not really of importance, because at that point I already saw a brilliant movie in many ways. The make-up is great en the setting is dark and creapy. An absolute classic !!",The Bride of Frankenstein
144,erwan_ticheler,A movie of Grrave importance!,10,11 August 2002,"Spoilers ahead!The Bride of Frankenstein is the best horror movie I have ever seen. It fascinated me from the word go with the opening titles that start with KARLOFF,not Boris Karloff.It is probably one of the few sequels that is actually better than the first(Frankenstein,1931).This is unique in horror,because sequels in horror are often very bad.The story starts where ""Frankenstein"" ended,at the burned mill. In this scene we find out that the Monster is not dead,but still very much alive and very p***ed off. This is not where the movie starts,because the movie starts with an intro in a castle with Mary Shelley(Elsa Lanchester who also plays the Monsters Mate!),Shelley and Lord Byron discussing Mary's famous book.The acting in this scene is like a stage play and looks kind of campy.We see scenes of the 1931 movie and then delicately slide into ""The Bride"".Each scene in the film has got a lot to offer and a lot to talk about.The actors are absolutely brilliant and well-casted. Unlike the first movie in the Bride the main character is the Monster(Karloff) and not Frankenstein(Colin Clive).Funny thing is that after the opening at the burned mill we don't see the Monster for about half an hour.Meanwhile we get to meet Frankenstein Wife,Elizabeth played by beautiful Valerie Hobson. The Bed-scene is quite hilarious because we see Elizabeth talking about her husbands work and get really wild,like she's on some sort of drug. The next scene is the entrance of Doctor Pretorius(Ernest Thesiger) who wants to create a mate for the Monster together with Frankenstein.By blackmailing Frankenstein(Pretorius kidnaps his wife) they decide to make this mate.An important part of the movie,which was not in the fist one,is the fact that the Monster starts to speak(You make man like me?).He gets lessons from a lonely blind hermit,his only ""friend"". The scenes with the hermit are pretty emotional and sincere and we get to see the good side of the Monster.Although Karloff portraits the Monster ingeniously,for me the best performance comes from Ernest Thesiger as the evil Pretorius.The witt and body language of Thesiger is so much better than Edward van Sloan in ""Frankenstein"". Only the performances of these two actors make the Bride an unforgettable picture. Other memorable appearances are from Una O'Connor(screaming as ever),Dwight Frye(who got killed in ""Frankenstein"")as Karl and E.E. Clive as the burgermeister(Monster Indeed,tush tush).Another big improvement to ""Frankenstein"" is the soundtrack by Franz Waxman,there wasn't any music in the 1931 movie! Each character has it's own theme.My favorite is the Pretorius Theme and of course the opening title which is really bombastic.Important to mention are also the great special effects. We already saw in ""the Invisible Man(1933)"" that James Whale could do unbelievable things. Look at the scene in Pretorius' house with his creations!James Whale has made with ""the Bride of Frankenstein"" his best piece of work and he changed the way of horror films by adding to the usual terror humour and witt.How important that was we can see now in the modern horror movies.A milestone in cinema! 10/10",The Bride of Frankenstein
145,malvernp,Best Sequel Ever! And a Classic Franz Waxman Score! And Great Fun to Boot!,10,2 November 2020,"My young grandson and I saw this movie together 16 years ago. I treasure that experience so much. It made him into an ""old"" movie fan, enabled me to then show him the wonders of plot-driven (as opposed to effects-driven) films and to provide him with a taste for the greatness of classic black and white cinema.This is a very special combination of humor, horror and pathos. It entertains, thrills and touches us in so many ways. The Monster in this film remains one of cinema's unique creations. This is the first of the sound Frankenstein films to link the name Frankenstein to the Monster as well as its creator. Boris Karloff has never been more effective and James Whale never more original and inventive. It is unfortunate that younger viewers are not more familiar with this film. It would surprise them with its intelligence, subtleness and wit---as well as its sheer entertainment value. Definitely a 10 out of 10! The screenplay is a masterpiece of engaging dialogue, effective pacing and clever situations. Is there a more remarkable scene in all of horror film than the visit of the Monster to the hermit in the woods?To provide just a brief sample of the versatility of the great James Whale, this is the same director who later gave us such very different films as the finest version of the timeless musical Show Boat and the first sound version of the Dumas classic Man in the Iron Mask!",The Bride of Frankenstein
146,LanceBrave,Both Cruel and Clever,9,1 December 2013,"""Bride of Frankenstein,"" like Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" is one of the most important horror films ever. Like ""Psycho,"" it has also been fully deconstructed over the years. Film scholars have overturned every rock in the film looking for queer subtext. Dr. Pretorius lures Henry Frankenstein out of the sanctity of his pure, Christian wedding bed with the promise of creating unnatural life. The way he gives Colin Clive small shoulder touches and, eventually blackmails him into his plot, make him come off like a bitter ex-lover. Some writers interrupt the scenes of the Monster and the Hermit as having a queer subtext, something I'm not sure I buy.On his audio commentary, Scott MacQueen talks a lot about the religious undertones in the film. While there are some unusual Christian images throughout, most notably the slow fadeout on the crucifix during the cabin scene, I think perhaps Mr. MacQueen is reading too much into it.While watching the film this time, I picked up on some nercophilic tendencies. Dr. Pretorius dismisses the grave robbers from the tomb, to spend some private time with the girl's corpse, an exchange that can be reinterpreted gleefully. Not long after that, the Monster crouches over the open casket of a recently deceased woman, pausing over the face. Of course, the undead Bride herself is presented glamorously, the first time the grotesque and the beautiful were combined in film history, a gorgeous face freshly sewn on to a dead skull. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it but the loving dead seems to be right there in the film's DNA.Textbook readings of the film aside, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is undoubtedly an effective film, a brilliantly constructed piece of work. Franz Waxman's original score is elegant. During the construction of the Bride, the beating heart provides a military drum beat, driving the action. The Bride and Elizabeth share a motif, a dreamy harp melody. When Elsa Lanchester is revealed in full costume at the end, wedding bells ring out. Though not free of the bombastic clanging typical of the era, it's a gracefully constructed score.The set design of the film is far more elaborate. We fully see both the exteriors and the interiors of the castle. When we return to the first film's laboratory tower, we get a loving pan up the stairs, beams looming over head. My favorite set in the film is the desolate graveyard the Monster marches across in search of safe haven. Or even his briefly glimpsed dungeon prison. The chair he's held down in comes across as a macabre king's throne.The movie is well shot. Particularly the moment when the Bride is resurrected with lightening. I love the dutch angles on the doctors' faces, the electric apparatuses buzzing and glowing around them. By 1935, the moving camera was in full use.Boris Karloff gives what might be his best performance. There's such a subtle melancholy to his face, his body language. The early scene of the Monster seeing his reflection in the lake for the first time, enraged by it, characterized the rage that drives him. This is the creature in full rampage mode, crushing all who reject and fear him under foot. But the scenes with the Blind Hermit establish his motives. Like in the first film, he yearns only for nonjudgmental companionship. The grace of Karloff and O.P. Heggie's performances makes the scene touching. It still gets me misty eyed after countless viewings. The search for a friend is what powers the Monster's entire arc. By the time he finds Pretorius in the tomb, gazing down on a skull, his search for love has taken on a deadly determination. No wonder, when faced with rejection at the finale, he decides to destroy nearly the whole cast in a fiery explosion.The rest of the cast is game. Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius casts a long shadow. It's hard to find a better villain in horror history. No doubt, he is the film's primary antagonist, driving all the threats in the movie. He delivers the clever dialogue with an effortless gleam in his eyes, both mischievous and sinister. When joking around with his homunculi, the film's highest moment of camp humor, his idea is obviously jokey. That same tone is deftly subverted into something threatening when whispering to the Monster ""Now,"" while closing the door, or telling Karl to go out and murder.Between Thesiger and Karloff, it's easy to loose sight of the rest of the cast. Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein, once lured into the plan, is surprisingly permissive. He doesn't seem to question just where Dwight Fry's Carl got that fresh heart. He comes off as an amoral character, perhaps unintentionally. Our new Elizabeth, Valerie Hobson, isn't given much to do, sadly. Elsa Lanchester, though her contribution doesn't amount to much screen time, is no doubt influential. Her twitchy body language and goose-like hissing suggests a fully conceived character.The movie is both cruel and clever. The dialogue is frequently amusing, such as Karl and the other grave robber's exchange. (""This is no life for a murderer."") Meanwhile, the movie has no problem clipping through its cast. After murdering the daughter in the first film, one of the sequel's first courses of actions is to kill her parents! That two sided sensibility, so obviously Whale-ian, would characterize countless horror/comedies to come. Every time I watch ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" I'm fully reminded of its genius.",The Bride of Frankenstein
147,Idiot-Deluxe,A Wondrous Masterpiece of Vintage Horror. 10+,10,9 July 2016,"Bride of Frankenstein was the last and the best of the superbly great James Whale/Universal Studio horror films of the 1930's and is hands down the best of all Frankenstein films (which go as far back as 1910) and is certainly one of the true quintessential's of classic black and white cinema. Brilliantly conceived from the ground up by the versatile and uniquely talented British film director James Whale and as far as horror films go in that era (31'-35') - Whale was in a league of his own.I find The Bride to be superior in every way to the original Frankenstein film (also directed by Whale and starring Karloff) more money, more experience, more inspiration and more creative freedom seem to be the key reasons. Every aspect of this uniquely brilliant film is of exemplary quality: casting, make-up design, script writing, lighting, photography, set design, musical score and most importantly inspired and imaginative direction, an absolute tour-de-force of talent and conviction from all involved. It's hard to drive home with words, just how colorful, entertaining and downright ingenious this ultra-classic film is. With The Bride the gangs, mostly, all back: Colin Clive energetically reprises his role as Dr. Henry Frankenstein, a 17 year-old Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clarke in the role of Elizabeth Frankenstein, Dwight Frye is back as a character very similar to Igor - just not a hunchback this time and the best for last, the dynamite performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Praetorius. What Thesiger does for this movie can not be understated, he's beyond brilliant in his role as the evil and manipulative Doctor Septimus Praetorius and every scene he's in he has full command of. He's supremely confident in his evil ways and it's always a delight to watch him plot, scheme and blackmail to get what he wants. His performance is often mentioned for it's ""arch effeminacy"", ""waspiness"" and overall flamboyance - in any case this wickedly colorful and off-kilter performance surely must put him in the top ranks as the ultimate mad scientist. A type of role meant for master thespians only. Simply put, Dr. Praetorius is one of the best and most entertaining film characters ever devised.As stated earlier the casting is brilliant in all the main roles, as well as several side characters such as, Una O'Connor, E.E. Clive, O.P. Heggie and Dwight Frye. Karloff's take on the Monster is among the best of his career, offering an infinitely more compelling performance the second time (of three) around; that and the ""Monster Makeup"" crafted by the masterful hand of Jack Pierce never looked better. When factoring in every aspect of this most iconic of make-up designs such as, the singed hair (monster's shouldn't sport BANGS!!!, as was seen in the first film), the multiple head claps, and the fact that Karloff's face was simply as bit fuller four years after the first film, which seemed to vantage the overall balance and effect of the famous monster make-up. Like I said ""iconic"" is the word, and having seen other actors portray the character over the years, the make-up definitely never looked better than when Karloff wore it.Like every other facet of this movie, the effects are TREMENDOUSLY FINE, much like the Jack Pierce make-up design, Kenneth Strickfaden's electrical gear is as iconic, as it is immediately identifiable. Frankensteins laboratory never looks or sounds any better than it does in this film and once it's electrical machinery begin to fire up and shot sparks and smoke - the laboratory itself qualifies as a character in and of itself. Some of the most electrifyingly lurid visuals ever committed to film happen during it's glorious high-voltage finale, which would have been impossible without Strickfaden's spectacular spark-spewing electrical apparati. Truly wicked a sight to behold.What about it's music? An early cinematic musical masterpiece is what composer Franz Waxman created for The Bride, said to be the first all-original film score featured in a horror film and after all these years it's still one of the very best. Waxman's music is all it Needs to be, When it needs to be and then some. My favorite aspect of the score is the ultra-exotic high-pitch 3-note motive that represents the Bride herself. This film is famous for a number of reasons, one of which is it's innovative lighting and photography, handled through varying degrees of sobriety by the great John Mescall. I've read articles that state that this film, from a lighting perspective, is one of the most beautiful films ever - I couldn't disagree on that point. You'll see some of the best looking tilted axis camera shots ever created, near the end of the film inside doc's lab; followed by an amazing montage comprised of shots involving both Dr. Frankenstein and Praetorius and, of course, all the amazing electric machinery found therein - running wide-open, crackling and spewing sparks all over the place. Some of the stand-out scene's of The Bride, include: first and foremost the amazing finale in the laboratory, Praetorius's picnic in the crypt, ""the bottle sequence"", the blind old hermit scene and when the monster is tracked down and lynched by angry villagers - among others, there's never a dull moment with the Bride of Frankenstein. It's feverishly creative monster-movie-making of the highest order.In the end, few films can match the level of creativity and the overall air of intrigue that this film possesses and what that all equals up to, is the most charmingly fascinating 75 minutes you're likely ever to see - not a bad effort for a film as vintage as 1935. And after seeing it on Blu-ray I can say without the slightest hesitation, that The Bride has aged beautifully, downright regally over the past 81 years. For that matter really having aged scarcely at all, because The Bride is a beautiful, timeless, work of art.",The Bride of Frankenstein
148,schroeder-gustavo,Superior in almost every way,10,9 July 2015,"Bride of Frankenstein is the sequel to the 1931 classic monster movie, Frankenstein. The original Frankenstein is an excellent movie, which had one or two flaws, but still a great film. Bride of Frankenstein faces us with the same philosophical questions that made the original so good and takes them even further.Let's start off by saying: Boris Karloff owns the role of Frankenstein. He is so good in Bride, you can almost believe that he is Frankenstein's Monster in real life. This story lets him really show off his talents, as he experiences way more emotion and has actual dialog in this sequel.I found one thing that I didn't like as much as I wanted to in this movie and that is the fact that it's not as dark as the first film. That being said it is still a pretty obscure movie with a very nice Gothic feel. There was one thing I hated about the original Frankenstein and it was the ending. It just felt too abrupt and had no real closure. Bride gets it just right.Bride of Frankenstein is that rare example of a sequel clearly surpassing the original. It is a masterpiece of horror cinema.",The Bride of Frankenstein
149,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Classic Monster Flick See it with a Chick,8,27 September 2011,"Yup it's true I am reviewing another Universal Monster picture. I just can't seem to get enough of these early monster pictures. Let's blame it on growing up watching Creature Double Feature on CH 56 in Boston on Saturday mornings. At least it's getting close to Halloween so you can use these recommendations to the fullest. So bust out some candy corn, popcorn balls and a cup of hot apple cider and check out this spooky review.The Bride of Frankenstein released in 1935 is the sequel to the Frankenstein (1931). The film features the same Director (Whale) as the original. He was able to wrest a significant amount of artistic control and freedom from the studio following hits with The Invisible Man and the first Frankenstein films. The director kept the same cinematographer for this picture as the original and he continues his use of German expressionist inspired camera-work and unusual angle shots.The majority of the original cast returns for this picture. Reprising the main roles, Colin Clive returned as Dr. Frankenstein and Boris Karloff is back as the Frankenstein monster. A significant addition to this picture is Ernest Thesiger as the sexually ambiguous mad scientist Dr. Septimus Pretorious. The set design on this picture is something to behold. Although, you can see the sets are heavily influenced by stage performance the director makes tremendous use of the limited space provided. In particular the design of the hermits cabin and the Lab where the monster is created stand out for their atmospheric elements.The plot of the film involves the discovery that both Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster are still alive despite their suspected deaths in the original. Dr. Frankenstein has plans to marry Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) and he renounces his creation. However, he is soon visited by former mentor Dr. Septimus Pretorious and asked to assist him in recreating life. Dr. Frankenstein is reluctant as Dr. Pretorious raises a toast to their venture ""to a world of gods and monsters"".Meanwhile we see that the Frankenstein monster is still alive as well. He lurks around the countryside doing what he does best. While almost drowning a young girl and then trying to smother her cries the monster is shot by 2 hunters and an angry mob is soon on his trail. In some iconic scenes the monster is befriended by a blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) who feeds him and teaches him some rudimentary language. The monsters brief respite from torment ends when he is discovered by hunters and burns down the hermit's cottage. While on the run the monster encounters Dr. Pretrorious in a crypt grave robbing and is enticed to assist him in creating a mate/friend for the monster. To this end the monster captures Elizabeth to force Dr. Frankenstein to create another creature with Dr. Pretorious. The creation sequence in the Lab is absolutely amazing. This often copied and satirized scene is a staple of American cinema and its worth watching this film just for that scene alone. Things go from bad to worse once Dr. Frankenstein shouts ""she's alive. Alive!!!"" This is the best of the monster movies that I have reviewed so far and is well worth watching. I probably had not seen this movie in 25 years and was surprised by the amount of influence on popular culture and cinema that's contained in the film. If anything this has inspired me to see more of these monster movies. I also feel a need to revisit Young Frankenstein (1974) as I would probably more readily identify with its themes. In summation this film is an exciting, scary, fun filled satirical romp and well worth your time. This film is currently available on Netflix for instant streaming.",The Bride of Frankenstein
150,peacham,Universal Horror at its Finest,9,12 October 1999,"This film is even better than the original.The performances are more developed and the plot more intricate. Karloff does well in his role but the two standout portrayals are Colin Clive as the mentally tortured Victor frankenstien and Ernest Thesiger as Pretorious. these two fine actor establish a chemistry that is seen rarely in classic horror films . Its a shame that Clive drank himself to death, who knows to what heights his career would have climbed. Also not to be missed is Elsa Lancester's dual role as Mary Shelly and the monster's mate. Classic horror does not get better than this.",The Bride of Frankenstein
151,twanurit,A Notch Below the Original,8,24 December 2001,"This is still a great sequel to ""Frankenstein"" (1931), but there are problems. The monster actually becomes more violent here, killing an elderly couple, a child, and Dr. Pretorious's assistant (Dwight Frye) without true provocation. In the original, he was driven to murder, or innocently, by accident. He also learns to talk, lessening the fear factor, not lost to Boris Karloff, who, in interviews, disagreed with the decision to make him verbal. He was right. All of the Universal sequels (except briefly ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" - 1942), had the monster mute. The title could refer to Dr. Frankenstein's (Colin Clive) bride-to-be (now played by Valerie Hobson) or the new creation (Elsa Lanchester) for the monster. Clive's role this time is basically a pawn to fulfill a fellow Dr. Pretorious's (Ernest Thesiger) mad schemes. Thesiger is excellent and steals the film from Clive. Two set pieces are superb: the poignant blind hermit (E.E. Clive) sequence and the breathtaking finale featuring iconic Lanchester (who also plays author Mary Shelley in the film's prologue). The Frank Waxman score is fine, but I don't recall it being re-used in the sequels (contrary to what the DVD production notes say). The subsequent Frank Skinner-Hans J. Salter scores were re-used constantly.",The Bride of Frankenstein
152,TheMovieDoctorful,A Far Superior Sequel To An Already Masterful Film,10,3 October 2016,"Before ""The Empire Strikes Back"", before ""The Godfather Part II"", before ""Spider-Man 2"" there was ""Bride of Frankenstein."" James Whale had already unleashed a groundbreaking classic upon the horror genre with 1931's ""Frankenstein"", but it was ""Bride"" that was his magnum opus. Everything that made the original film such a hit is multiplied x10 in this home run of a sequel. The powerful performances, the deep characters, the emotional weight, the creepy and gorgeous atmosphere and effects. ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is classic horror tragedy at its absolute finest, a shining treasure from a long gone Golden Age of Horror. ""Bride""'s runtime is 1 hour and 15 minutes, and I never wanted it to end. The film focuses on two protagonists; Dr. Henry Frankenstein and his infamous Monster. The film balances the arcs of both these characters perfectly, keeping me invested from beginning to end. Dr. Henry Frankenstein is much more likable in this installment than the first film, a character who most certainly has learned his lesson from the grim, violent events of the first film. He creates a ""mate"" for his Creature not out of personal ambition or curiosity, but out of fear for the safety of his wife. However, there is still a fragment of the impulsive, crazed scientist from the first movie laying dormant in Henry's psyche, slowly and subtly revealed once Henry is threatened to create The Monster's ""Bride"" by Dr. Praetorious under punishment of death. Henry is forced into a battle for his very soul in ""Bride of Frankenstein"", a battle I was desperately rooting for him to win. The Monster's arc is just as emotionally investing and gripping; rather than fighting for his soul, he is merely fighting for hope and companionship. The Monster here is portrayed as a childlike, self loathing figure, searching desperately for a reason and justification to exist. Even after saving a small child from drowning, he is rewarded with hatred, torture and imprisonment. Watching The Monster slowly lose more and more hope in life and love over the course of the movie is heart wrenching, I just wanted to reach through the screen and give him a well deserved hug.To say the special effects have charm would be a gross understatement. The makeup effects for The Monster are much more realistic and detailed than in the first movie. (Not a small achievement, given the effects in the original ""Frankenstein"" were quite impressive) Dr. Praetorious's homunculi still hold up today as looking shockingly realistic and lifelike, surely they must have been truly groundbreaking back in 1935. The sets are as gorgeous as they are diverse, suitably grand and detailed. They help the world of ""Bride"" feel massive in scale.Boris Karloff oozes likability and sympathy in a role almost completely mute. His facial expressions carry more weight and emotion than most actors could deliver in hours of dialogue. In the few times he does speak, he brings a deep sadness and humanity to the role of The Monster. The suffering in his voice is almost contagious. Colin Clive gives a lot of depth to a role already full of it as Dr. Henry Frankenstein, balancing the line between repentant. noble soul and repressed madman. He brings a great amount of nuance and emotional range to Frankenstein.Ernest Thesiger is downright chilling in his role as the evil Dr. Praetorious. Praetorious represents the darkest, most repressed qualities of Henry Frankenstein without any of his remorse or humanity, and Thesiger plays him with a truly sinister and downright frightening screen presence.Valerie Hobson gives an underrated performance as Henry's wife Elizabeth, now a paranoid, emotional wreck from the events of the first movie. She absolutely sells Elizabeth's psychological trauma and torment. She is a living reminder of all the pain and suffering Henry inadvertently unleashed upon the world, as well as what is at stake for the future of everything he cares for if he fails to retain his humanity.Of course, it is impossible to talk about ""Bride of Frankenstein"" without mentioning the Hermit scenes. The scenes involving The Blind Hermit's interactions with The Monster are some of the best, most beautiful and most bittersweet scenes in film history. Seeing The Monster receive such kindness and compassion from The Hermit, acted with almost infectious warmth and charisma by O.P Huggie, after all the cruelty and injustice he's suffered is immensely satisfying. You can tell that things will end in catastrophe, but the these seemingly small moments of unconditional love and generosity between The Hermit and The Monster have more heart in them than the entirety of most feature length films today. O.P Huggie and Boris Karloff have an electric chemistry on screen, I could watch them interact for hours.The ending of the film is similarly emotional, as The Monster decides to give the ultimate sacrifice to save his creator and his wife, the very people who once feared and scorned his very existence. His time with The Hermit has taught him the value of unconditional love and empathy, of taking a ""leap of faith"" for the sake of helping others. It's a beautiful, searingly emotional ending complimented by a phenomenal facial acting from Karloff.I could go on and on about how masterful this film is, but everyone else already has. ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is well regarded as a classic, and that's a status that it most definitely deserves. Without question, a horror masterpiece.",The Bride of Frankenstein
153,simeon_flake,We Belong Dead....,10,22 August 2014,"The greatest sequel of all-time (imo) and the only movie where the actor playing the Monster gets top billing--not much of a surprise as Karloff turns in a stellar performance, almost matched by the tour de force of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, who has so many great lines, especially when he's trying to convince the troubled Henry Frankenstein to ""leave the charnel house and follow the lead of nature or of God if you like your bible stories.""Getting back to Karloff for a moment--I know the idea of a talking Monster is one that has divided some fans for many years, but I think having the monster speak only added much needed dimension to his character & made him even more empathetic throughout the movie. Who doesn't feel for the poor monster during that scene in the cabin with the blind man when the hunters break in & the place goes up in flames as the poor Monster comes out of the blaze, arms extended, crying ""friend.""And of course, there is the scene where the Monster comes calling on Dr. Frankenstein. ""What do you want?"" ""You know."" The monster demands a mate--but much to his shock & disappointment, the Bride recoils at his touch & the well placed self destruct lever in the castle comes in handy for the poor, tormented Monster. ""We Belong Dead!""The score for the film adds tremendously to the proceedings and every actor in this film is on top of their game. And, there are the usual comedic touches one comes to expect with a James Whale film--the best being E.E. Clive as the uppity burgomaster (Monster indeed, I'll show him).Basically, if you love the classics, then this film is required viewing. 10 stars",The Bride of Frankenstein

Frank now is not just a man-made monster wrecking havoc hither & yon, he's a sympathetic figure looking for legitimacy, i.e., a wife. But it is his tapered, hissy not kissy bride-to-be (Lanchester), her co-Creator in the professionally blackballed Dr Pretorius (Thesiger) and the oh-so charming literary trio that open the story (Mary Percy Byron / Balderston) who make the magic in this fabulous follow-up (4/4).",The Bride of Frankenstein
156,jed-estes,"Superb, In Every Way.",10,1 September 2006,"This is the ultimate Universal horror show. It also has the greatest line of almost any film I can think of, ""We Belong Dead!"". When Boris Karloff uttered those three words the world changed for the better. That was so powerful and meaningful to what the monster stood for, which was a disconfigiration or diverge from God's supposed plan for the world. It shows that people who can not be accepted by society feel so divulged of humanity that they feel the need for the release of suicide. This film tries to show us that if something looks bad, maybe it still has heart and is good natured. While the Monster did do bad things, it was because he was treated no different. This goes into the fact that people are made into what they become, and not born that way. If Baron Frankenstien had showed live and compassion for his creation then the monster would have conveyed those same emotions in turn. Watch this movie for it's greatness and the fact that it has never really been equaled.",The Bride of Frankenstein
157,rcolgan,"""To a New World of God's and Monsters!""",8,4 August 2015,"Whilst James Whale did not originally appear interested in returning to horror with a sequel to Frankenstein, as it took almost 4 years of convincing by Universal before he agreed to make the sequel, it is clear that it making this film was a great decision. By returning to the directors chair he was able to create a great continuation of the original film, bringing more iconic Gothic visuals along with a further look in to the humanity of the monster. Whale starts the film right where his original left it. We're at the burning windmill as the mob brings back Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who barely survived the encounter to the village, whilst leaving behind what they think is the burning corpse of the monster (Boris Karloff). However we discover that the monster is not dead and begins to once again wreak havoc on the countryside. In the meantime, Dr. Frankenstein is contacted by his old colleague Dr Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) who wants to recreate Frankenstein's experiment and create a woman, the be the companion of the monster. Clive's return as Dr. Frankenstein is a great one, that should not have been cast any other way. He brings the same hysterical quality that made him the image of a mad scientist in the original Frankenstein, whilst also showing a great change to his character by resisting the requests to recreate his experiment. This means that whilst he's still fascinated in the concept of creating life, he's seen what it can do and approaches it with a new found fear of its consequences. But obviously the most important character is the monster himself, with Karloff returning to the iconic role. It's a different continuation of the role, as this time the monster learns to talk over the course of the film thus giving Karloff an even greater range to get over the conflict and turmoil of the monster. But the character is still the same icon he was in the forest, with Whale continues to explore the monsters humanity along with how society forces aggression upon the monster and causes him to rampage. Even when the monster attempts to do good, such as one scene in which he saves a drowning woman, the moment they see the beast they immediately judge him and chase him with pitchforks and torches. Through this Whale explores how things are not always as one sided as how it may at first appear. What might at first appear evil can be good. And the path that the many follow can actually be the true evil.In the film's greatest scene, we see him meet a kind blind man in the woods. When he goes in then for once there is somebody who cannot see him and does not instantly brand him as a monster. Instead he actually treats him with kindness, inviting him in as a friend, feeding him and even teaching him to speak. These are certainly the film's most heartfelt scenes as we see the monster for the first time experience true joy due to finding the comradery that he was lacking and not feeling isolated in the world. It's not until the mob tracks him down once more that his hopes of a peaceful life is dashed and he once again must continue his rampage in the woods. After this the monster begins to long for a mate and working with Dr. Pretorious, kidnaps Dr. Frankenstein's bride to force him to recreate his experiment with a women. It's dark motives and actions like these which ensure that the monster is never one sided, but instead Whale creates a very conflicted character being pushed into violence by a society that hates him and a mind of a murderer giving way to his natural instincts. There are parts of this film that I don't think work very well. For example there's some unwanted comedic relief from a maid call Minnie and a very bizarre scene where Dr. Petorious is revealed to have created miniature people that leads to a ridiculous green screen. Comedy like this just felt so out of place when also juggling with themes such as the monsters humanity or the concept of a human playing god and probably would have been better suited for a parody film like Young Frankenstein. But nonetheless this is still a great film. Whale succeeds in further exploring the complexity of one of the most iconic characters in cinema and is fitting as his finale venture in to horror.",The Bride of Frankenstein
158,anthonyf94,The dead's woman,7,31 August 2019,"Karloff is undoubtedly the best Frankenstein's monster of ever: this is sufficient as a reason to watch the movie. But the main reason is the psychological deepening that the creature receives for a study of the affect conception - and of the maintaining of the spieces. Problems not so analyzed in the book, but that here open themselves in all their psychological depth: what does it mean, for a dead man reborn, the research of the perfect lover? It lacks a little of the mystery of the first movie; but also the second chapter works great and it opens to the lucky series of movie about Frankenstein (and family).",The Bride of Frankenstein
159,robert-259-28954,Worthy of the accolades.,10,15 July 2017,"As many would agree, this film was rare in that it surpassed even the landmark, Universal original. Along with Boris Karloff reprising his signature role, and the new additions of Elsa Lanchester playing two iconic roles, and a fabulously demented Ernest Thesiger, as ""Dr. Pritorius,"" this remake added many dramatic improvements which made it the classic in Gothic horror that it is. First, a memorable, atmospheric soundtrack that was superior to anything else, before or since, second, an enlarged cast of tremendously interesting and inventive characters, and finally, actual DIALOGUE being written by for the once silent Monster, played with such perfection by Karloff as to beggar the imagination. His absolute mastery of both pantomime AND voice not only gave the creature added dimension, but an understated sense of humanity and compassion unseen in the first.A word on the performances. It's fact that the most difficult kind of acting is NON-VERBAL acting. If this be the barometer of true skill, Boris Karloff deserves the crown. He was remarkable. I must have watched this film 100 times since my early childhood, and still it horrifies, captivates, and entertains me. No other actor but Karloff could have made the Monster come alive, his lumbering, zombie-like movements setting the standard for all other movie monsters to come. Nobody did it better. Just watch the way the Monster enjoys his first cigar, then suddenly delivers a whimper in the back of the throat that only a first-time cigar smoker would understand. Classic. Now, for ""The Bride,"" Elsa Lanchester. Watch her wide eyed movements—staccato, bewildered, unsure. I later discovered that she actually patterned her approach to the part after the wild swans she observed in a London public park. Genius. But her crowning moment was when she uttered that primal hiss at the Monster, just before the end. Again, she was imitating the sound of nature, an angry, captive mountain lion she had once seen in a movie years before, waiting for the moment she could actually use that sound in a performance. Well, she got her chance... AND HOW.",The Bride of Frankenstein
160,RomanJamesHoffman,"How to follow a classic film? Well, just make an even better one.",9,4 September 2013,"Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius.Like its illustrious predecessor, the movie explores the injustice enacted on the monster after having been given life by a God-playing mad scientist. As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be.Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score.As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be ""better"" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.",The Bride of Frankenstein

The fact that it picks up mere moments after the original also really works and makes the films feel intimately connected in a way that just feels right.The Wolf Man may have a slightly more tight narrative, and the Invisible Man more devilishly funny but this is all things considered my favourite Universal Monster movie.",The Bride of Frankenstein
162,boscofl,"""Woman . . . Friend . . . Wife""",10,18 September 2021,"The apex of Universal Horror is achieved with James Whale's legendary masterpiece Bride of Frankenstein. Rarely in cinema would story, direction, and performances coalesce so perfectly as they do here. Furthermore this is one of the rare sequels that is on par with the original and, in my opinion, more entertaining.The narrative begins inside a windswept castle where Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester), her husband Percy (Douglas Walton) and Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) discuss her story of Frankenstein between thunderclaps. Mary reveals that the tale did not conclude at the burning windmill which sets the stage for the remaining footage. Turns out the Monster (Karloff) survived the fire and embarked on a series of adventures looking for companionship. Meanwhile, Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) survived his fall and is visited by another old professor, Dr Pretorious (Ernest Thesiger) who suggests they collaborate on creating a mate for the Monster. Henry is reluctant but eventually blackmailed into compliance; soon the title character is alive and the Monster approves. But will she?The genius of Bride of Frankenstein is that it works on so many levels: creepy, funny, irreverent, often blasphemous, and ultimately tragic. James Whale deftly tells his story interwoven with his familiar personal touches including black humor, eccentric characters, and an undercurrent of homosexuality. Everything amalgamates perfectly in a (mostly) subtle way and can appeal to all ages without offending younger viewers. For example Dr. Pretorius is referred to as a ""queer looking old gentleman"" which can be taken in a number of ways. Whale abundantly weaves religious themes throughout his yarn - sometimes reverent and sometimes blasphemous - while presenting the Monster as a Christ-like figure who is wronged by everyone; misunderstood and mistreated.The screenplay, credited to William Hurlbut, is fantastic and is a logical progression from the previous film. The Monster's escape from the burning windmill - by falling into a water-filled basement - is believable and his quest for a mate is sound basis for the story. I certainly appreciate the adherence to continuity with the return of many characters and iconography from the parent film; Universal would play fast and loose with continuity over the years but the Frankenstein films represent their best efforts. Returning to the watchtower was an inspired decision and the creation scene is much more detailed and spectacular here; the equal of its predecessor which is no mean feat. The evolution of the Monster, particularly his learned ability to speak, is brilliantly handled. The scene where he confronts Henry for the first time and orders him to ""sit down"" is a clever callback to the original and signifies how the nature of their relationship has been reversed.Technically Bride of Frankenstein is nearly flawless. The sets are memorable particularly the various forest locations and the iconic watchtower. The Universal backlot is shown to full advantage in brilliant sunshine to contrast with the darker, stagebound woodland scenes. Kenneth Strickfadden's electrical machines are in top form and footage of them buzzing, whirring, and sparking would pop up as stock footage in countless future films. The musical score by Frank Waxman is legendary and would echo through Universal films for years to come; it is almost certainly the best in any horror film. John P. Fulton's special effects are top drawer particularly the rendering of the tiny people in glass jars; impressive in any era. And what Universal classic horror film would be complete without a brilliant Jack Pierce makeup conception? This movie gives us not one but two timeless creations. The Bride is onscreen for 4 minutes yet is a quintessential monster design recognized the world over. Karloff looks the same but different: the essential features are the similar but his hair is singed off (as it would from fire) and he has some burn scars; his hair slowly grows back during the course of the film which is an amazingly detailed touch.While the film is virtually pristine part of the fun is nitpicking some inconsistencies and story incongruities. Although Bride provides some overall continuity there are some discrepancies: Maria's father is now named Hans after being Ludwig in the previous film, the Burgomaster has transformed from no nonsense Lionel Belmore to pompous E. E. Clive, and Frankenstein's home is now a castle. The ending of Frankenstein, with Henry peacefully recovering in his bed, has simply been disregarded and old Baron Frankenstein has apparently shuffled off the mortal coil. The monster seemingly murders a young girl and thrashes an elderly couple in their home for no apparent reason (this might be explained by some postproduction editing to prune the running time). Elizabeth is trussed up in a cave at one point and then shows up in the watchtower at the climax; how did she escape? How did she know to go there? And why is the watchtower rigged for demolition? Furthermore, why is the trigger some enormous, easily-accessible lever?The final component contributing to the film's luster is the cast. Boris Karloff delivers his most complete performance as the Monster and dominates the film. This is Karloff at the height of his powers; he retains the character's basic innocence while turning him into a more evolved person. His final moments, where he is rejected by the only being who could possibly relate to him, is heartbreakingly rendered by the actor. Colin Clive is more overwrought and unstable than he had been previously but is equally compelling. Valerie Hobson takes over the role of Elizabeth and, although spending much of her time in hysterics, is a worthy successor to Mae Clark. In the dual role of Mary Shelley and the Bride Elsa Lanchester cements her place in cinema history with an iconic turn as the bird-like, hissing female creature who (ironically) can't see past physical imperfection.The rest of the supporting cast is peppered with James Whale favorites. If not for Karloff's brilliance Ernest Thesiger would have walked off with the picture in his role as the brilliantly sarcastic and bitchy Dr. Pretorius; this is one of the most marvelous performances in all Universal horror. Una O'Connor tops her performance as Mrs. Hall in The Invisible Man with an even more shrill turn as Frankenstein's housekeeper, Minnie. It is positively hilarious how she is in the middle of nearly everything that happens in the first 55 minutes of the film; clearly Whale loved her as she enjoys so much screen time. E. E. Clive is convincingly imperious as the puffed up Burgomaster while Dwight Frye returns as another dim-witted, murdering assistant who gets snuffed by the Monster again. Finally, Gavin Gordon pontificates marvelously as Lord Byron in the prologue; he rolls his Rs with more gusto than Edward Van Sloan in Dracula.In my opinion Bride of Frankenstein is the greatest achievement in all cinema horror let alone just Universal. While it was never particularly scary and some critics lament the amount of comedy it is still thrilling and positively entertaining. Certainly it represents the pinnacle in the careers of James Whale and Boris Karloff; Whale in particular would never come close the heights of Bride of Frankenstein again. As for the Monster, sadly this would represent the peak of his evolution as he would become less human and more of a walking prop as the Frankenstein series would progress. Fortunately for us we have this definitive interpretation to enjoy.",The Bride of Frankenstein

With her frizzy, hi lighted hair, ear piercing scream, and dramatic death, she is not likely to be forgotten any time soon. The film focuses on the monster as he stumbles around the countryside, wreaking havoc and terrifying villagers(because saving lives and being friendly to old blind people would terrify ANY villager.) The subplot involves an evil genius trying to find a mate for The Monster so he can breed them and create a world of monsters. This is a great movie. The Monster even learns to talk here, an ability he would lose in subsequent films. The scene where The Monster and the old hermit are crying almost made ME cry. There's also nutty Una O'Conner for some comedy relief. In fact, the whole movie has an underlying sense of humor to it, another reason this is a great film. See it!

165,Colbridge,"James Whale is in a satirical, playful mood and surpasses the original",9,15 November 2021,"James Whale's superb sequel to his hugely successful and influential Frankenstein (1931) manages to surpass the original due to the perfect blend of humour, gothic visuals, impressive set design, excellent musical score and a playful script, not to mention Boris Karloff's sensitive, frustrated and angry portrayal as the Monster.After a brief prologue between author Mary Shelley and poet Lord Byron to get the audience up to speed on events from the first film, the sequel picks up where the last one ended as we see the villagers leave the wreckage of the burnt out windmill, assuming they have killed the Monster, unaware that Frankenstein's creation has survived and will come back to terrorise them again.Colin Clive returns as Dr Frankenstein, although the actor was in ill-heath and died just 2 years after this film was released due to alcoholism, but he gets to utter those immortal words 'It's Alive, it's Alive' for a second time as he joins forces with the eccentric Dr Pretorius, a wonderfully camp performance by Ernest Thesiger, who comes across as more evil and twisted than Frankenstein, to create the Bride played by Elsa Lanchester.There is a definite shift in tone from the first one, there are darker moments but equally there are more comedic moments and it makes for a perfectly entertaining movie. James Whale is in a satirical, playful mood here and cannily gets several references passed the censor such as alluding to homosexuality and necrophilia which modern audiences are able to pick up on.The iconic look of the Bride is once again created by make-up designer Jack P. Pierce, who also builds on Boris Karloff's Monster make-up which goes through several subtle changes throughout the movie. The atmospheric black and white photography by John Mescall, the elaborate laboratory set design and the multi layered music score composed by Franz Waxman all contribute to make this a near perfect masterpiece and the best of the classic and influential Universal monster movies of the 1930's and 40's.",The Bride of Frankenstein
166,hung_fao_tweeze,All things considered - a really fine movie,9,1 January 2004,"By some people's horror standards, including my own, this movie doesn't deliver horror....exactly. I wasn't horrified in any scene. I really wasn't scared at any point, in fact. It is hard for me to see this in the 'HORROR' category. It's more of a SF/Romance/Drama/something - and a very nicely executed one at that. I guess the important thing is that at the end you could decide if you were entertained. That is a definite YES. This is another of what I call 'wise' movies. As a sequel to the original Karloff 'Frankenstein', it doesn't try to repeat the original. It builds upon the original and expands the story in some very interesting ways. Also, the special effects department did some pretty amazing things here as well considering the age of this movie.Karloff is exquisite as the so-called monster. He humanizes the character but doesn't take it into the maudlin. You could almost like this guy. The inflection in the few words the monster picks-up along the way - memorably delivered nearly every time! He is just a confused child, folks. I marvel at Karloff's acting here every time.All of the other characters handle their parts with the usual professionalism of that era. For some reason bringing back Frye in a different role strikes me as a 'good luck' move. Nobody spins 'on the edge' like Frye.The story is well-written and holds your interest, the pacing is good, the situation is plausible like good SF should be - you can suspend disbelief comfortably and have fun.The music is competent and not imposing. Elsa's female creature is hardly in the movie at all but when she takes the stage - wow. The impact is still there. The hesitancy and expectation. It gets kind of creepy and then very sad. A great climax for everyone (except Boris and Elsa - pun partially intended)As old as this movie is it is still 'put together' well. It has got to be one of the finest B&W films of all time in my book. It frequently tends toward the theatrical but that was the acting style then. These two things (B&W / the acting) tend to date the film. Duh! The lack of any CGI effects can make it unvisual enuff for many of today's spoiled generation. The effects are there and are great, but you see them all the time now. There is nothing really new here. It was new at the time but now....? Don't expect anything in this movie except a really good solid story. Karloff shines! I miss him. For the era, this is definitely a 10, but today? Between 8 and 9.",The Bride of Frankenstein
167,danjakubik,A sequel as excellent as it's famous predecessor,10,9 October 2010,"The Bride of Frankenstein / 1935 / Directed by: James Whale / Written by: William Hurlbut""The Bride of Frankenstein"" certainly ranks as one of the greatest horror films ever made and is that very rare kind of film, as excellent as it's highly successful and acclaimed predecessor. The film continues the unfinished story of the first film, where Dr. Frankenstein is persuaded to create a mate for his monster. Director Whale decided to use the sequel to complete the telling of the original novel of 1818.One difference, compared to it's predecessor, is the film has a music soundtrack. Frank Waxman's music score is majestic, dark and convincing. Sound quality is impressive for it's time and was nominated for an Oscar. Legendary makeup artist Frank Pierce delivers the same excellent style and technique with the monster, now with some added details. The monster speaks for the first time in this film. The monster's mate, or bride, is classically inspired by the Egyptian queen Nefertiti. The bride of the monster, masterfully created by Frank Pierce, has become as iconic as the monster and Boris Karloff's performance is again compassionate and sensitive, a portrayal of a man misunderstood and feared. The prologue of the film is masterfully done. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, her husband and friend are together inside an elegant mansion at night while a thunderstorm rages outside. It's believed that Shelley, along with some literary friends, brainstormed the idea of ""Frankenstein"" during a thunderstorm one night. This circumstance and a dream resulted in the creation of one of the most famous and respected horror novels of all time.Of special note are three acting performances. 19 year old Valerie Hobson, replacing the original actress portraying Dr. Baron Frankenstein's finance' gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernest Thesinger and Uma O'Connor give impressive, memorable dark and comic performances, respectively.The creation sequence of the monster's mate recreates the same majesty and power of the original 1931 film, this time with the help of Waxman's excellent music score. Though on screen for only about five minutes, the appearance of the monster's mate, as the bride of Frankenstein, near the end of the film, is especially powerful and memorable, becoming iconic over the years since the film's release. Along with the creation sequence, it adds up to roughly ten minutes of great cinema.Besides the music score, what set's this film apart from it's predecessor is it's use of humor, effectively blended with horror. A difficult combination indeed, but Whale pulls it off masterfully here. Reluctant to direct a sequel, Whale approached making the film as a lark and created one of the best ever sequels in film history and in some ways, superior to it's excellent predecessor.Whale did not return to direct the third film in the Frankenstein series. By the late 30's, the magic of the early 30's horror films had faded.",The Bride of Frankenstein
168,dagonseve,The Monster Returns!,10,14 July 2010,"In 1818, Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus was first published anonymously in London. Audiences in France would later discover in its second publication that the story was a product of a young and dark imagination. That imagination, aged 19 years, was Mary Shelley. No one could have predicted that her novel would be produced into a film over a hundred years later and her beloved monster would instantly become one of the most recognizable faces since the inception of film. It was never Whale's intention to make a follow-up film to 1932's Frankenstein but under certain contractual obligations and a substantial amount of pressure from executives, he finally agreed to make another film based on the Frankenstein monster. The original working title was known as ""The Return of Frankenstein"" but was changed to Bride of Frankenstein based on a small story arc in Shelley's novel. So, now that we've thoroughly explored the in's, out's, and around's, we have a solid background to build upon and we're ready to continue onward. Soonward!The story opens with Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley seated comfortably in a sitting room discussing the horrors of her novel. Mary states that a moral lesson is to be drawn from her tale and goes on further to explain that other events occur after the initial story's final act. Subtle screen transitions then depict the closing scene from the first film, as the Frankenstein monster escapes from the burning wreckage and flees into the woods. Meanwhile, Dr. Henry Frankenstein's body (his name was originally Victor but for reasons unclear to me they changed it for the sequel) is recovered and brought back to his fiancée Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson replaced Mae Clark who played Elizabeth in the first film). Henry is approached by his former mentor Dr. Septimus Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) and expresses an interest in furthering their research. These introductory elements head smoothly into a classic moral tale.Bride of Frankenstein celebrates the same lavish sets and cinematography that helped make the first film beautiful. If you take the time to admire the set design it becomes clear that amazing things were produced 75 years ago – there are still several sequences where I had to ask myself, ""I wonder how they did that?"" We could agree on how similar these devices are but a welcome addition that you'll find in Bride of Frankenstein is the use of comic relief, especially from Dr. Frankenstein's housekeeper Minnie, played by character actress Una O'Connor. The presence of this comedic effect is quietly slipped into the dialogue but if you pay close attention and have an offbeat sense of humor you may pick up on it. In some ways it's refreshing to watch an enjoyable sequel without the overuse of marketing campaigns and slogans that slowly bleed dry the film's worth – but even in the '30's, sequels exhibit cliché moments to capitalize on the first film's success. Show business is show business but I've chosen to exercise a more lenient approach this time and ignore the negative attributes that plague most sequels. What may be the biggest issue with Bride of Frankenstein, though, is how little screen time that the Bride has. With a title that openly proclaims the main attraction and a female monster that is easily in the top ten of all horror icons, her part is a small one. The Bride is played by Elsa Lanchester who also fills the role of Mary Shelley in the film's prologue. James Whale did this intentionally, not on account of budget constraints but with the purpose of portraying the duality of man. The small increments that the Bride is available are, without a doubt, classicit's wonderful how much of an impact her character has on the genre which is why many film critics hail this film as Whale's masterpiece.If you love old movie monsters from the silver screen and have always wondered what the hoopla was about, especially that of Frankenstein, The Monster, and the Bride, you HAVE to see this. I recommend starting with the original and then viewing this one – just a friendly bit of advice. Nowonward!",The Bride of Frankenstein
169,clivey6,Contrived cash-in sequel,4,8 October 2009,"Having quite enjoyed the original early 1930s film Frankenstein, when I saw its sequel was even more feted and dubbed the best monster film ever, I made sure to rent it.Well, certainly its more technologically advanced, with a bigger budget and music on the soundtrack (although the almost audible silence on the original, so characteristic of early 1930s films, I found quite eerie). But I didn't really rate it. Like the Bond film Quantum of Solace to Casino Royale, it starts only 15 minutes after the last film ends. Problem is, they wrapped it up nicely at the end of the last film, so the sequel has to contrivedly and unconvincingly unpick all the loose ends to start the story up again. It's not a long film, and half an hour in we're back to the Monster rampaging through the woods all over again. Only this time it's a mite comical, less Frankenstein than Frank Spencer, as he well-meaningly gatecrashes women in the woods and they run off scared and screaming.A wily old mentor, who we've never seen before, arrives to coerce the scientist into having another bash at his experiments. (This is a common problem with sequels in which the 'hero' has learned his lesson the first time, or is too cowardly to go through it again - they have to be coerced by someone but it loses its dramatic edge imo.) To show he's a dab hand himself, this mentor reveals his own experiments, but they're so far-fetched and far ahead of the scientist's cut and paste job, it defies belief. What's more, the director presents it as if it's funny when it could be plain horrible. There is a strange relevance to the story, what with the controversy over stem cell experimentation. In some respects the difference is between the Bond villain Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker.

It's been a while since the last movie, so has anything improved? I'd say yeah! This movie has more music, more characters, better set design, and even cooler-looking makeup. The acting feels better too. We get some really nice scenes with Henry and the Monster as well as Dr. Pretorius. There's even a scene with a certain experiment in jars, and it still looks pretty good. That's really all I can say without getting into spoilers. You should watch it, it's good!",The Bride of Frankenstein
171,jadedalex,Sequel is better than the original,10,24 January 2010,"I am of the opinion this is one of the great horror films. It's scary, it's fun, it's thoroughly entertaining.Nothing against the original ""Frankenstein"". It's a shame that they had censored that film. The cutting of the scene with the little girl at the pond makes The Monster seem atrocious in its censored version, compared to the restored version, which plays much better, the monster simply wanting to see a lovely thing float.Even as a child, I found the jolt in the continuity disturbing. as the camera shows the villager cradling the now-dead girl. What did the monster DO to her???For all of ""Frankenstein""'s merits, it simply is dull compared to ""Bride of Frankenstein"". We have the wonder Ernest Thesiger as Doctor Pretorius. What a face! (He really makes Whale's earlier ""The Old Dark House"" work.)One simply forgets how beautiful Elsa Lanchester was when she was young. This is of course her classic role, both as the 'Bride' and as Mary Shelley. The histrionic Una O'Connor is always a plus (she was also excellent in ""The Invisible Man"").The scenes of the monster with the blind man are both funny and sad. (Seems to me Hitchcock must have taken a cue from Whale when he made ""Saboteur"".)Of course, it all culminates with the stylish ending....the great music of Franz Waxman, and finally the image of Elsa Lanchester as The Bride. I assume Hollywood tries to do this these days (as in Tim Burton's silly ""Edward Scissorhands""), but for horror, style and humor, I'll take this Whale film (along with his marvelous ""The Old Dark House"") anytime.Recalling Elsa, she was gorgeous as ""Anne of Cleves"" in ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"", too.It's rare when a sequel is actually better than the original, but it applies with this movie.Two thumbs up, holding a cigar....""mmmmm......smoke good!""",The Bride of Frankenstein
172,dlynch843,Elsa good,8,16 November 2019,"That Franz Waxman score is bizaare--sounds like it should accompany a beauty pageant. Especially when the bride is ascended to the storm.

173,tonyjackie,Gothic horror at it's best,10,15 November 2006,"The sequel to 'Frankenstein' is an absolute must for any horror fan.It is a very well made with a terrific atmosphere and fabulous sets.Boris Karloff stars once again as the creature and gives a fabulous performance.He captures the suffering of this poor,unfortunate wretch and there is nobody that could have done it better.Colin Clive is impressive as the tortured and tormented scientist and it is a performance that seems to go hand in hand with the problems he had in his private life.Ernest Thesiger is wonderfully camp and creepy and has a ball.So is it better than the first film?It is definitely more entertaining with a lot more going on.There seems to be a more expensive feel to the whole movie as well.I think that James Whale does a better job this time around with his direction with scenes tighter and not as much drippy dialogue.There are many great scenes here.The miniature humans grown from seed,the fabulous creation of the bride,brilliantly played by Elsa Lanchester.Also very moving are the scenes with the creature and the blind hermit.I do feel that the first film was scarier though,with nowhere near the same comedic elements that are in Bride.Another slight doubt I have is whether the creature should have spoken or not and I know That Boris Karloff definitely thought that he should have remained silent.I tend to agree although the creature could actually speak in the original novel.Whenever I compile my top ten movies of all time,I always cop out and list 'Frankenstein' and 'Bride of Frankenstein' together.i do the same with the first two 'Godfather' films.Well,as Boris says at the end of the film ""We belong Dead"".I happen to think that these two fantastic horror films belong side by side.One other thing,the music is terrific as well.",The Bride of Frankenstein

A true classic.",The Bride of Frankenstein
177,23skidoo-4,Highly overrated,7,6 May 2004,"This review contains potential spoilers.It has often been said that Bride of Frankenstein broke the golden rule of Hollywood that says sequels are never better than the original.I'm afraid I have to disagree -- the first Frankenstein film was head and shoulders above this sequel that turns the Frankenstein Monster from a frightening, yet oddly sympathetic creature, into a joke.Part of the problem was the decision to make the Monster talk with a ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" vocabulary. Boris Karloff was reportedly against the idea, and rightfully so. It renders scenes that could be seen a true pathos into jokes - no less than Saturday Night Live would lampoon Bride of Frankenstein thanks to the late Phil Hartman's ""Fire bad!"" parody of the talking Monster.There are also elements of this film that have no business being in there -- the idea of Dr. Frankenstein becoming a patsy to the Faust-like Dr. Pretorius, for example. The previous film gave us this trailblazing if misguided scientist bringing life to the dead ... only to find out Pretorius got there first, and in miniature. The scene with the miniature people in bottles is amusing, and for 1935 a marvel of special effects, but it took me right out of the film.The script is just awful for much of the film. It's as if someone mainlined Shakespeare and tried to regurgitate it back as a Frankenstein movie. Although Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein actually comes off quite well, as does the Blind Man, everyone else comes off sounding like idiots. 
And speaking of idiots - James Whale might have been a great director and an icon, but he should have been shot for allowing the shrill, cackling character of Minnie to exist in this movie. More than once I was tempted to turn the DVD off because I couldn't take her caterwauling. If The Monster had killed her at some point it might not have been so bad, but to let her live is cruel and inhuman punishment for the viewer.The performances range from excellent to campy. Karloff, as usual, does a terrific job, and his charisma lessens the blow of the silly dialogue he is forced to utter. Elsa Lanchester, in a dual role as Mary Shelley and The Bride, is magical to watch, but it is to film lovers' eternal regret that she didn't get more screen time as The Bride. Valerie Hobson is gorgeous as Elizabeth, but betrays her acting inexperience in a few scenes (it's hard to believe she was only 17 at the time). Colin Clive, despite being given more theatrical, less realistic dialogue than in the first film, does his usual good job. Ernest Thesinger is embarrasing as the mad Dr. Pretorius. I'm told he was James Whale's drama instructor or something like that -- it shows. It's always hard to direct your teachers.And Una O'Connor's performance as Minnie is worthy of the worst Ed Wood film, and not much else.There is also sloppy continuity with the first film. Aside from changes of actors -- which is fair enough -- there are errors that should have been caught, such as giving a different name to the character whose daughter was killed by The Monster in the first film. Despite my criticisms, Bride of Frankenstein isn't a terrible film on its own merits. Karloff steals the show, as usual, and Elsa Lanchester is electrifying (pun intended). But to this Frankenstein fan, it utterly pales in comparison with the first film.",The Bride of Frankenstein
178,dav07dan02,frankenstein needs a mate!,10,18 October 2005,"Director: James Whale, Script: William Hurlburt, John L. Balderston, Cast: Boris Karloff (The Monster), Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorius), Colin Clive (Henry Frankenstein), Valerie Hobson (Elizabeth Frankenstein), Elsa Lanchester (The Bride/Mary Shelley), Una O'Connor (minnie), O.P. Heggie (Blind Hermet).This is a true sequel to the first Frankenstein film as it picks up exactly where the previous left off with the burning of the monster in the mill. The film opens with Mary Shelley telling the story of what happened to Frankenstein's monster leading us into the movie. As it turns out, the monster survived the burning of the mill and is discovered by the twisted-eccentric Dr. Pretorius played wonderfully by Ernest Thesiger. Like Dr. Frankenstein, Pretorius had also experimented with creating life but he has only been able to make little human figures(very bizarre!). For some reason he wants to create a mate for the monster and needs Frankenstein's help doing so. However, Frankenstein wants nothing more to do with his cursed creation so Pretorius has the monster abduct Frankenstein's precious Elizabeth to get Dr. Frankenstein to comply.Many people consider this to be the best in the Frankenstein series and the best of all the universal horrors. I actually have a slight preference for the first but by all means, this is a great film. It has been said that this film is a very close representation of James Whale's personality. Due to the enormous success of the first film, he was given much more control this time around and it does appear that he had more fun making it. While the first film was a straight sci-fi- horror this one has many humorous moments. It is a rather bizarre film.Boris Karloff and Colin Clive returned for this installment. Mae Clarke did not so she was replaced with Valerie Hobson as Frankenstein's fiancée. Colin Clive's performance is equal to the first film. Karloff is able to do more than grunt for he now can talk. He comes across a blind hermit(O.P. Heggie who was also in Anne of Green Gables the year before) who takes him in and befriends him. In doing so, he teaches him how to talk. For obvious reasons, the monster is afraid of smoke and fire and freaks out when the hermit lights a cigar but he gets the monster to try the cigar and wins him over. This very funny scene parallels Whale's love for cigars. James Whale had used Una O'Connor in many of his films. She helps add to add some of the humour in her sometimes over the top performance as the Frankenstein's maid. Jack Pierce's make-up work for the bride is superb. Elsa Lanchester is the ultimate goth chick! I think she's Hot!!!!!!!!!",The Bride of Frankenstein
179,jhigginbotham151,"Its Still Alive, Its Still Alive",9,8 May 2014,"Bride Of Frankenstein is the follow-up to James Whales Frankenstein and carries on exactly where the original left off. The monster is back, a new doctor is trying to create his own monster and Frankenstein is still haunted by the effect his work has had on the town.Bride Of Frankenstein may actually outdo its predecessor. Its musical score gives every scene its own dramatic weight - the original had no musical score. The monster is a much more sympathetic and three - dimensional character this time around - he wasn't explored this much in the original. Its also just as memorable as the original, Whale again crafts every scene with the same love and care he gave the original four years prior. Karloff really shows off his chops here. Showing uncontrollable rage, a raging sadness and ultimate realization with not a flaw in sight. His cold dead eyes are the eyes to a monster who was a failed experiment, an unwanted child. Whale explores those themes of abandonment in depth here, showing the monster do be a lost soul, abandoned before he could speak. The blind old man he meets acts much like an adoptive father, taking him in and caring for him, the monster also being much needed company for the old man. Ernest Thesiger is Dr. Pretorius, and he is such an over the top character its brilliant. Its as if Whale knew evil bad guy tropes before there were any. The accent, the body language, the kidnapping of the protagonist wife to blackmail him into doing his bidding, its all there and oh boy is it fun to watch. A scene where Pretorius encounters the monster is hilarious, he turns and sees the monster and simply says 'oh, I thought I was alone', really!, just a fantastic character.My man Colin Clive is back and sadly isn't in the film as much as I would like, but when he's in it he rocks. We even get to see, at the end of the film, a little of the mad, obsessive Dr. Frankenstein from the first film. Its a testament to how memorable Clive was and still is and I find it a crime he was taken so young, he had so much more to give.Overall, Bride Of Frankenstein is a marvelous sequel. Everything they could have done better was done and anything they could have included was included. This is how you do a sequel and at only 75 minutes (only a few minutes longer than the first, and thats only because it spends 4 minutes recapping the previous film), You can easily watch both films back to back and have a wonderful time doing so.",The Bride of Frankenstein
180,G00fhunter,Need more bride,6,13 September 2021,I really enjoyed the plot and that the monster learned to speak as well as the comedy that was put into this installment of the series. I loved that the monster learns life lessons about consequence and that he actually has a moral compass. The acting was on point and I enjoyed the film but wasn't crazy about waiting so long for the bride and then finding out that she is in the movie for less than five minutes.,The Bride of Frankenstein
181,dwankan,"Bad for the 30s, horrible now",3,1 August 2020,"I can't understand the wealth of praise this film gets. The acting is either wooden or hamfisted, the plot is laughable, and the production is, like its predecessor, clunky. It isn't scary, there isn't any meaningful social commentary, and the plot is not in the least surprising or interesting. What surprised me the most, and is one of the most telling details about this and the original, is that Mel Brooks's parody copied entire scenes without changing them because they were already so laughably ridiculous. What I had been laughing at in that film for years, thinking they were over-exaggerated parodies of scenes, were almost carbon copies in a lot of cases. 3 stars for historical significance alone: this is not a good movie.",The Bride of Frankenstein
182,Ziggy5446,The best of all Frankenstein films!,10,12 December 2006,"Their are few sequels that are superior to their predecessors, however, Bride of Frankenstein not only equals it's masterful original prototype Frankenstein (1931), but infinitely surpasses it in every way. Despite the first films reputation as a classic, it's honestly not quite as witty and is much too straightforward when being compared to much more satirical, Bride of Frankenstein. Not to mention, it lacks much of the sophistication in the effects and eccentricities that the immortal sequel possesses. Needless to say, both films are justly hailed as classics, but it's the immortal sequel where James Whale's combining of horror and wicked humour (and ""hidden"" inflammatory work) is expressed more clearly and more prominently.After initially refusing to do a sequel to Frankenstein, director James Whale would eventually falter when Universal agreed to let him have complete artistic freedom. Production was much-publicised as early as 1933, however, Whale, who was following his towering success with Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, and The Old Dark House, wouldn't begin working on a sequel until late 1934, which was originally entitled The Return of Frankenstein. The film was adapted by William Hurlbut and John Balderston from an incident from the Mary Shelly novel Frankenstein, in which the monster demands a mate. However, in the novel, Dr. Frankenstein creates the Bride, but instead of bringing the monster to life, he decides to destroy it, greatly differing the film adaptation from the novel.Most of the original cast remained, as the film reunited Colin Clive (as Dr. Frankenstein) with Boris Karloff (as the Monster), but Mae Clarke, a blonde, who was dropped from Universal was replaced by then seventeen year old Valerie Hobson, a brunette (as Elizabeth). Clark was acceptable in the role as Elizabeth in the first film, however, Hobson excels when in comes to chewing up scenery; therefore handles the role much better in the sequel. Both Marilyn Harris (Little Maria from Frankenstein) and Dwight Frye (Fritz from Frankenstein) would return as well, but as different characters - Harris appearing uncredited and Frye appearing in another memorable role as Karl. Also, new characters were brought to the forefront: Ernest Thesiger (as Dr. Pretorius) with Una O'Connor (as Minnie) and Elsa Lanchester having a dual role (as both Mary Shelley and The Bride).Unfortunately, Clive had suffered from a broken leg during most of the filming - a result from a horseback riding accident - and most of his scenes were shot sitting or laying down. However, once again, Clive did an absolutely incredible job portraying Dr. Henry Frankenstein and proved to be a perfect choice yet again. Though, for much of the film, he takes a backseat to the fine and unique acting of Thesiger, who gives an unforgettable performance as the ""mad scientist"" named Dr. Septimus Pretorius, who much of the film revolves around. There is a sexual uncertainty to Pretorius' character and many suggestions of homosexuality. With the films masterful blend of horror and black comedy, it's Thesiger who shines best and in many ways the film is stolen by him when he's seen on screen; the equally charismatic O'Connor works best when playing directly opposite of Thesiger.Bride of Frankenstein is also presented with the same terrific German expressionist camera-work by cinematographer John J. Mescall, although reportedly drunk through much of the production, uses brilliantly effective camera movements and angles that added eminently to the creation of the Bride scene. Mescall also composed a number of bizarre and inventive angles that intensified Thesiger's skeleton-like frame and vivid characteristics aiding his already superb performance. Although for Karloff, the four hour makeup job done by Jack P. Pierce, which was blue-green in colour, gave Mescall nothing but problems. The film is also accompanied by a fascinating score composed by Franz Waxman, which is nothing less than a masterpiece of excitement and melody. Though it wouldn't be Waxman's most mature work, it most certainly remains one of his most famous and probably his most influential.Much of the film concerns itself mostly with the Monster (Karloff) trying to find a place in the world and his growth; much of his character is seen as a humanely being craving for the company and acceptance of others but is mostly rejected. He fails to seek friendship with the young shepherdess (Ann Darling); with the Monsters experience in the first film with Little Maria, he knows that he must save her from drowning. Of course, everyone finds him too frightening, however, in one of the many incredible scenes the film provides, the Monster is eventually provided with sympathy and encouragement when he encounters the old blind hermit (O.P. Heggie), who becomes the Monsters first true friend. Karloff's performance is truly remarkable, as it was in Frankenstein. Although, he opposed that the Monster speak, his character benefits greatly from this, as he finds room to expand on his already brilliant craft.The memorable sequence of bringing the Monster's Bride (Lanchester) to life is unequaled - even the original scene in Frankenstein pales in comparison. The presentation of the birth of the Bride is stunningly as well, as Clive exclaims: ""She's alive! ALIVE!"" Lanchester who only stood 5'4"" tall was placed on stilts that made her 7'0"" tall, as well as, her unforgettable shock hairstyle which stood up and hinted that the electricity had shocked her to life was held by a wired horsehair cage. Also, her darting swan-like movements were inspired by the angry swans in London's Regent Park. Although, the Bride's appearance is extremely brief, it's most certainly worth it, especially when she finally encounters the Monsters.The macabre, satirical Bride of Frankenstein is a key film to the horror genre (perhaps the best) and one of the genuinely great films of any genre. It's one of the most wonderfully crafted films in cinema history and is easily lauded as Whale's finest screen hour. This one has rightfully deserved it's ranking amongst the best of what Hollywood has to offer.",The Bride of Frankenstein

First let's talk about the acting, Boris Karloff and Colin Clive are absolutely fantastic as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster. Every one else dose good but none as good as Karloff and Clive. Now the story line, unlike the First Universal Frankenstein movie, this one follows the book more, like with the old blind man, the bride the the creature wants so very badly, and so on. Never the less it is a great storyline no matter what. Now lets talk about the music score, needless to say it kicks a$$.

185,ToxicJug,Beautifully Dark,7,24 December 2020,"While not being fully up to par with the original in my opinion, The Bride of Frankenstein is still a classic none the less. I find that it takes way to long for the bride to actually show up given that she is the primary selling point of the film. With that being said however, Elsa Lanchester managed to become one of the most iconic female roles in cinematic history with only a few brief minutes of screen time and no real dialouge (which is impressive to say the least) I also find the entire first half of the film to be rather lacking. However, after you get past that I find that the film really picks up and becomes the oddly beautiful fi that it is, showing us how man is the truth monster and manages to judge based on appearance alone. If something is different than what we are used to we naturally assume that it is not right. This movie shows us that while telling a very captivating story.",The Bride of Frankenstein
186,jbirtel,A Brilliant Continuation!,9,18 September 2002,"The first sound film that defies the fate of the sequel. It's been said over and over...and I agree, they did better the second time.If you took out the opening 'Mary Shelly' prologue; spliced the end of 'Frankenstein' (moving the 'Old Baron's' ""to the House of Frankenstein"" toast; to after Henry's return home in 'Bride of...', many viewers wouldn't realize they are watching two separate movies (at least, not right away, until you realize that Elizabeth and the Burgomaster are portrayed by different actors).That's how well this film works. It's less horror and more fairy tale! But the horror is still there. And so is the humor! And so is the depth of the most famous misunderstood Monster! Impossibly, Karloff expanded on the role of 'Frankenstein's Monster' to such a new height, that it's never been equaled in any of the sequels; or in any of the remakes. It's his performance and James Whale's direction that makes this one of the best horror movies ever made (definitely the best 'Frankenstein' movie ever made). But it's impossible to have the same level of enjoyment for 'Bride of...' without first having seen the original. It is that very high quality that makes both movies inseparable. There are so many scenes that have achieved classic status. Many are lifted from the novel; many are rehashed from the original film. No need to list them here; just sit back and enjoy! I've seen reactions from people who have never seen this movie before. And after 65 years, people are still affected by Karloff's moving performance (especially the scene with the blind hermit). And 65 years FROM now, people will STILL be affected by it.This could have been the last 'Frankenstein' movie. And even though the remaining sequels were unnecessary (and were not in the same high quality...'Son of Frankenstein' was the next best in film making structure, if not evoking the same sympathetic reaction towards the Monster as the first two entries), the sequels are still tons of fun to watch. And besides...if they weren't made, we would have missed out on Abbott and Costello's hilarious encounter.In the meantime, 'Bride of...' has stood the test of time!
9 out of 10 ! A Classic Gem!",The Bride of Frankenstein
187,talarisw,"A sequel to the 1931 horror classic, Frankenstein, where ""The Monster"" is looking for love, so Dr. Frankenstein and his insane colleague create his bride.",10,2 November 2012,"One of the best ""monster movie"" of all-time. I saw the original and this movie in theaters as a Halloween special by Turner movie classic channel. It was awesome, seeing them both on the big screen. Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are the best of the legendary movie series. I think what makes those two movies such classics is that they were the first real movies based on Mary Shelly's novel and were more closer to the Shelly's book then the sequels. I always felt that the original and this sequel were kind of part of one story, the real sequel was the third film ""Son of Frankenstein"". This is a direct continuation of the last film with the same director James Whale and Boris Karloff returning as the iconic monster. In fact this film is based on a subplot in Mary Shelly's original novel, where Dr. Frankenstein considers creating a mate for his creature. James Whale did a great job directing this film, the pacing is good and the look of the film is great. Unlike the original film this one has a musical sound track that works great in the film. The reason why most people say this is the best of the Frankenstein films is because this has a lot of meat too it, there's more stuff going on here then in the more straight forward, simplistic original. These classic monster movies from Universal in the 30's and 40's are not really scary but still has a creepy quality too it that work wells. The idea of putting dead bodies together and bringing it to life is kind of creepy and makes you question someone's sanity who attempts that. Like in the original film this film begins with a cold opening of sorts, which is one of the best parts of the film. Elsa Lancaster, who plays ""the bride"" plays Frankenstein author Mary Shelly who's in a mansion with George Gordon lord Baron, ""England's greatest signer"" and Percy Byshe Shelly, ""England's greatest poet"" and she begins to tell them the story of the movie. I love how Lord Baron roles his Rs when he talks, it's so appealing. It's a great intro to the movie and I like the idea of having Lancaster play Mary Shelley, there's something cool about seeing her as the woman who wrote the story, Mary Shelley and then later see her as the monster's bride. The film begins where the last one left off but some people didn't come back, Fred Kerr as Dr.Frankenstein's father does not appear here, neither the actor or character return after being a major character in the last one and no explanation of his where about. Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clark as Dr.Frankenstein's wife and she does a good job. I love Colin Clive as Dr.Henry Frankenstein, he's the best and is sometimes underrated in his pitch perfect portrayal of a conflicted scientist who's not bad but is tempted by desire to play god. I love Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, he's a great edition to the story, a scientist crazier then Dr. Frankenstein. He has a good mixture of crazy, humor and a little flamboyant which caused a lot of people to question if he's gay, maybe he is. He has a creepy looking face too. There's a lot of humor here too, like Minnie as Dr. Frankenstein's loud mouth maid, she was not in the original but inexplicably appears here. Although there's a scene that I thought was too surreal, when Dr. Pretorius shows Dr. Frankenstein his 2 inch people that he grew, I thought that felt out of place. I love Boris Karloff as the monster, I thought it was great hearing him talk, unlike in the first film where he was silent. Although I thought it was a bit of a stretch that he went from not being able to talk to within two days mastering the English language. But I like his friendship with a blind hermit, that was well done, showing that he's not a total monster he just needs a friend. The best part of the movie however is towards the end where we get to see the much anticipated ""bride"". The whole scene is awesome! Dr. Frankenstein says his iconic ""She's alive"" and I love the way he says it. Elsa Lancaster is terrific in her role, she's only on the screen for five minutes or so but she makes every minute count. It's great silent acting by her, she has the perfect look of a confused, horrified woman who just awoke from the dead. The church bells were great when she was introduced. I love her movements, she just really sells the idea that she just came back from the dead. I love her look as well, she looks kind of sexy in a creepy kind of way and of course her trademark electrified hair was a great idea. I love when she hisses at the monster in her last scene, the way she does it is really creepy. I feel sorry for her because like the monster in the first film, she wasn't given a chance to adjust to life after being brought back from the dead, this is definitely a tragic love story. I wish the bride would've been brought back for a sequel, I would of liked to see how she'd act in the outside world, would she kill people like the monster did? This is one of my favorite films from Universal classic Monster movies. An all-time classic.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Really good way to start out a sequel. It had a strong story! Although I do find the title to be a little misleading, but that doesn't really matter, I guess. One thing that I, and every other horror film viewer, know is that horror movies are notorious for having characters who, in their terrorized state, make the worst decisions possible- and this film is no exception. There were so many characters who were constantly making stupid mistakes and causing unnecessary harm to others/themselves. And they never learn."" New information? Bad outcome? Who cares! Let's do the same thing over again!"" That was a little frustrating, but what can ya do? *shrugging emoji* Fascinating characters, new and old. Great character development with the monster. Amazing effects!! AMAZING, can't believe what they managed to do in 1935. Really impressed by their creativity and innovation in story-telling techniques. Great angles, a wide variety, including some very Beautiful, elaborate sets, and impressive props. A great score complementing the film, wow.Super creepy, thrilling, and very entertaining. Gotta suspend your disbelief many times regarding the mortality of the characters. I'm sure it was just due to a more modest audience's standards, but to a viewer in 2015, the violence is silly. Any deliberate killing was done with minimal effort and in a way that obviously wouldn't actually kill anyone, but when serious injuries occur they heal rapidly, miraculously.Definitely a good watch. I recommend it. Don't know if I'll ever watch it again and or own it, but it's a fun one! 8/10 Bye love you",The Bride of Frankenstein
189,Joel I,Greatest sequel ever made,10,10 November 1999,"This is undoubtedly the greatest sequel ever made.  What many people remember as great scenes in ""Frankenstein"" are in fact from this film (especially the sequence with the blind hermit that was so memorably parodied by Mel Brooks).  In Dr. Pretorius we have the screen's number one mad scientist of all time (great peformance by one Ernest Thesiger) and in the Bride we have THE hairdo.  The film is memorable for its expressionistic sets, lighting, and camera angles, as well as a terrific score by Franz Waxman (dig those blaring trumpets in the opening).  The film is not particularly scary -- more gothic than horror, and unexpectedly moving, especially in the performance of ""Karloff.""  Who will ever forget the scene where the monster first confronts his ""maker"" with the chilling growl of ""Fraaaankenstein.""  This is one of Hollywood's great masterpieces and secures James Whales's place in the pantheon of great directors.",The Bride of Frankenstein
190,Ursula_Two_Point_Seven_T,Best. Movie. Ever!,10,1 October 2004,"You really need to see the great original Frankenstein (1931) to appreciate to the max the Bride of Frankenstein. Frankie was GREAT, Bride was GREATER!Bride has it ALL -- humor, pathos, camp, subtle social commentary. I never tire of watching this movie. In fact, each time I watch it, I fall in love with it even more. My only complaint: Not enough Elsa Lanchester!The movie opens with a prologue that I just love! Mary Shelly, her husband, and Lord Byron are talking about Mary's book. This serves to summarize the plot of the original movie and set up the sequel. Mary is amazing, because she's played by the awesome Elsa. Lord Byron is a raging, flaming hoot and a half!Boris Karloff should've gotten an Oscar for his performance. Even though the monster murders a few people in cold blood, you hardly notice or blame him, as he's so sympathetic throughout this movie. James Whale (director) was a genius to give him speech (Bride is the only movie the monster speaks in).The mad Dr. Pretorius is the greatest mad campy scientist ever. And his ""little people"" (you have to see the film) are amazing special effects for 1935!The bride herself. I wish I had more than 1000 words to write just about her. Elsa was magnificent as the bride, especially when she was hissing and spitting at her hideous-looking ""mate"". Boris broke my heart with the look in his eyes as it changed from hope to despair when he realized his bride reviled him. This momentary scene where Boris said so much with only his eyes has got to be one of the finest pieces of acting I've ever seen.This is a wonderful tale of love and longing and wanting to belong, of being an outsider. I've heard, too, that it may be a subtle metaphor of the then-unaccepted lifestyle of homosexuality (James Whale was a homosexual, and I think he identified with the monster who only wanted love but was shunned by everyone he came in contact with). That alone would have made the film sympathetic but also perhaps somewhat maudlin. However, Whale brilliantly infused the film with the wicked campy humor of Dr. Pretorius. Words cannot do this character justice. You have to see him to believe him! (Una O'Connor's character was supposed to also be humorous, but I mainly found her annoying. She gets less annoying on subsequent viewings, but some people find her quite hilarious.)In summary: Hiss! Spit! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! And, now that I've written this review, I feel the urge to go watch it again, for the 27th or so time!",The Bride of Frankenstein
191,pitsburghfuzz,The Bride of Frankenstein!,10,10 February 2010,"Even though I prefer Frankenstein, to most people, Bride of Frankenstein is a perfect example as a sequel of a great film, and make it even better. I love this film. The story begins with Mary Shelly (the author of Frankenstein, played by Elsa Lachester) telling her husband and Lord Byron that her story has not ended yet. The windmill has burned down and Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) had been taken home to his future wife, Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson, Mae Clarke was sick at the time but i feel they are equally beautiful and great as Elizabeth). The monster (Beautifully portrayed by Boris Karloff) is still alive and roams about the country side. Then we meet perhaps the most eccentric, gayest scientist the silver screen has to offer: Dr. Pretorious played by Ernest Thesgier. He tells Frankenstein that he himself had created life, but differently than Frankenstein's method, and lures Frankenstein back into creating a mate for the monster. The monster then is capture, but easily escapes and on the way, he meets a blind hermit. This is one of the most emotional scenes in the history of movies. They both have a disadvantage and both help each other reach a common goal: finding a friend. Soon after, two hunters walk in and accidentally burn the house of the hermit down. The monster is then chased by villagers through a graveyard and walks into crypt, thus meets Dr. Pretorious who promises him a bride. The monster then captures Elizabeth and then Frankenstein and Pretorious start creating the bride. The ending is fantastic for the movie, so I won't ruin the surprise. The acting is superb in this film and exceeded my expectations as a sequel. On its own, its a great movie for the horror genre and for all times. The Bride of Frankenstein is a brilliant piece of art.",The Bride of Frankenstein
192,Nothinggrandproductions,"Fun, Campy, and Self-aware",8,30 August 2013,"The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.",The Bride of Frankenstein
193,supernma,Tragic and Thrilling,8,12 January 2012,"""We belong dead!""""Bride of Frankenstein"" outdoes its predecessor in terms of thrills and style, and certainly delves deeper into the psyche of the monster - one of cinema's most tragic figures.The film is expertly directed by horror-maestro James Whale, featuring richly atmospheric cinematography, bold camera movements, wonderfully Gothic art direction, and fantastic use of miniatures. Again, in terms of style the film is simply a feast for the eyes.Karloff's acting, while less subtle than the previous film, is yet another powerful example of making a monster with minimal dialog something you feel for and even shed a tear over. You get a sense that the monster is more frustrated, more self-loathing than we was before, making his encounter with the bride all the more gut-wrenching, because like everyone else she rejects him because of what he is on the outside, something all humans can relate to. Karloff's best scene is with the blind man in the woods - a bittersweet moment because we know his happiness is misguided and will not last for long.Of course, I couldn't write a review of ""Bride of Frankenstein"" without mentioning the bride herself, a horror movie icon despite only being on screen for about five minutes. Elsa Lanchester makes quite an impression in her brief screen time, creating the franchise's most unnerving character, with her twitching movements, screams, and hisses (I find her far more frightening than the monster, who is very sympathetic).The film also adds more humor and camp, which, in my opinion, doesn't quite work as well, but it really doesn't hurt the film as a whole. Overall, it is a fantastic sequel that raises the stakes and succeeds most when it is not trying to thrill or frighten us, but simply wants our humanity.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Through the process, the monster learns how to talk and learns that Frankenstein is the man who created him. Frankenstein is visited by the evil Dr. Pretorius to help in creating a mate for the monster and is best said when they toast to partnership, ""To a new world of Gods and Monsters."" In the end, James Whale did a magnificent job and not skipping a beat from the last movie. It was good to see Karloff and Clive return for this movie where it would be Whale's last movie. Karloff returns once more as the Frankenstein Monster along with Bela Lugosi in Son of Frankenstein.

197,saeedahmedsasoli,Perfect movie.,10,25 November 2020,"The setup, with Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley, talking with the foremost romantic poets of the time, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron (who also rolls his r's), is a great lead in as she brags about writing a story that will make your skin crawl. She must have been something in that male dominated society. Of course, her mother was one of the first to demand rights for women. When she reappears as the Bride, it is awesome. And who came up with the hair. It is one of those things like the monster's neck bolts, that has become such an icon for our culture.The story opens with Mary Shelley telling the complete story. This immediately sets the perfect atmosphere which is held during the whole movie. No doubt about this...one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, do whatever it takes to get a copy !!! I gave the original Frankenstein a rating 10 out of 10, so I guess there isn't a rating that is high enough to praise The Bride of Frankenstein.I actually prefer to think of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein as two halves or a single film, and given their short running times, they can be viewed back to back in about two and a half hours. If you haven't seen either one yet, you owe it to yourself to watch them at least once.There is a great deal more humor in this film, most of it delivered by Thesiger in laugh-out-loud lines that are not funny at all taken out of context (""You're wise in your generation"" for example), and I don't want to ruin any of the witty and florid dialogue for you. The film careens wildly from humor to pathos, creepiness to zaniness, in a roller coaster ride of styles and emotions. The slickness doesn't detract from the atmosphere, and since the first film was an enormous hit for Universal, to try and duplicate the low-budget look of the first film would have been pretentious.This is just about as close to a perfect movie that one will encounter, and certainly a perfect Universal horror flick.

199,ACitizenCalledKane,"""To a new world of gods and monsters!""",8,7 January 2005,"Picking up where James Whale's 1931 horror classic, Frankenstein, left off, we are presented a very intriguing sequel. This film takes the ideas of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and embellishes upon them quite a bit. Although I believe that James Whale's sense of humor and ""camp"" quality take away from the picture, I believe that the thoughts that are brought to the story make up the difference. I am not going to debate whether The Bride of Frankenstein is superior to the original, or not. It is as futile as a battle of the sexes. While The Bride of Frankenstein uses the same characters, and same story as a base, they are quite different, which is why I feel that comparing the two is utterly pointless. While Frankenstein brought up moral issues about man playing God, this film focuses more on the after-effects, human nature, relationships, and, in some very odd ways, family mechanics (no pun intended. Boris Karloff's second incarnation of the monster is much more human, more sensitive, and more developed. In the first film, he merely smashed through things, strangled townspeople, and expressed very basic emotions (fear, anger, etc.). Here, we see that the monster now understands how alone he is. He has developed a longing for acceptance and even love. His true nature is also revealed, I believe, in a few scenes in particular. The most poignant of which is the scene in the blind hermit's cabin. Much credit is due to O. P. Heggie for his emotional performance as the kind, lonely, blind man, who is unable to see the physical deformities of the monster, but still sees the the basic humanity within him. Being able to see, the rest of the villagers fear the monster, and attack it on sight. This scene is very important because it shows how we, as human beings, judge others so harshly on appearances. Colin Clive returns as Dr. Frankenstein, no longer bent on the creation of life from the dead. That is, until he is provided with a new scientific venture through the flamboyant former philosophy professor, Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger). His proposition is to create a new monster, a mate for Frankenstein's monster, so as to develop a race of creatures. At first, Frankenstein is against the notion, but soon, his ambition gets the better of him once again. Their collaboration reaches a climax with the unveiling of their new creature, The Bride of Frankenstein (Elsa Lanchester). There are many iconic scenes in this film, particularly, the ""birth"" of the bride. This is an interesting movie, owing much to early German expressionism, and while I don't know if it is superior to Frankenstein, I will say that it is definitely worth seeing, especially for fans of classic horror films.",The Bride of Frankenstein
200,mbuchwal,"If you loved ""Frankenstein,"" you'll be crazy about his bride.",10,21 August 2008,"The quintessential Gothic horror movie sequel, Universal Studios' 1935 hit, the ""Bride of Frankenstein"" adds grotesque gallows humor to the macabre and spine-chilling formula that made the original ""Frankenstein"" movie the biggest box-office hit of 1931, featuring the most talked about monster in horror movie history. Taking up where ""Frankenstein"" left off, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is the terrifying tale of how the murderous monster first escaped doom to find a mate  a bride  made like himself from the parts rifled off the bodies of the recently dead. The Hollywood King of Horror, Boris Karloff, reprises his most famous role in a top-notch performance remarkable as much for its camp irony as for its shocking ghoulishness. This time, Karloff outdid himself! Although its bloodcurdling effects are closely patterned on the first ""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride"" is much more than a sequel. It is a hilarious send-up of the original, featuring priceless scenes of ham acting by a cast of wonderfully colorful character actors, among the most talented ever to appear in a horror movie. Genius director James Whale has created the most expressionistic and frightening of Gothic films, made up of spellbinding effects which are a distillation of all that is best in horror movie technique: dark shadows and blinding flashes of light, hideous suspense and a gut wrenchingly scary monster.All of the distinguished cast had very solid backgrounds before being cast in ""Bride."" Karloff had already appeared in over 80 movies, including Universal Studios' hit ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu,"" while scene stealer Ernest Thesiger, who appears as the exquisitely decadent Dr. Pretorius in ""Bride,"" also appeared alongside Karloff in another James Whale directed chiller, ""The Old Dark House."" Classically trained Una O'Connor, Dr. Frankenstein's bug-eyed hysterical maid, began her acting career with Dublin's renowned Abbey Theater company, but was early typecast by Hollywood in oddball character roles, usually as a serving woman in such hit movies as ""The Invisible Man."" Mainly a character actor, Elsa Lanchester's acting almost always featured a great deal of graceful poise and charm, perhaps because she studied with dance legend Isadora Duncan -- making her a natural for the dual role of Bride and Mary Shelley.",The Bride of Frankenstein

202,mhesselius,Not as good as Frankenstein,7,26 July 2010,"BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is one of my favorites. But unlike most film buffs, I don't think it lives up to Whale's original, or even to THE OLD DARK HOUSE (1932). In BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN comic relief featuring the usually marvelous Una O'Connor and E.E. Clive is much too broad, and the monster's meeting with the blind hermit is maudlin. Mel Brooks did not have to add too much to get laughs from scenes that were already unintentionally funny.Also a giant continuity gap opens when Elizabeth, Dr. Frankenstein's actual bride, who was being held captive in a cave, suddenly and with no explanation appears at the door of the laboratory pleading for Dr. Frankenstein to escape with her. In John L. Balderston's original treatment they all die. And a sub plot about murders committed by Dr. Pretorius' assistant Karl played by Dwight Frye (who bears some resemblance to ""M"" star Peter Lorre) was edited out of the original release along with a scene showing the body of a child being carried away. These were changes the studio demanded because of negative public reaction during previews, and they point to a much darker story.Whale may not have wanted to make another monster movie, but when he began work he did try to deal seriously with themes he explored in FRANKENSTEIN. Only after Whale's homosexuality became the subject of legend did critics motivated by cultural politics re-interpret the film as a dark comedy of sexual identity.Having said that, I do think Ernest Thesiger's Doctor Pretorius is deliciously wicked. But his character is not obviously homosexual, and I can only surmise that such a reading is a retrospective interpretation based on Thesiger's openly Gay lifestyle. Pretorius' character seems to have been suggested by the villainous alchemist Oliver Haddo in Somerset Maugham's THE MAGICIAN, a book that was filmed by Rex Ingram in 1926, starring Paul Wegener of THE GOLEM.Whale may have seen Ingram's film. He may have read the book. The thing that made the best directors of the '20s, '30s, '40s, and '50s better than the best directors of today is they created the art of cinematic storytelling by reading literature, not by viewing film. Details from Maugham's novel - Haddo's celibacy and his obsession with creating homunculi (little people) - are elements of Dr. Pretorius' character that could only have come from the literary source because Ingram never used them in his film.Negative comments aside, the film is a masterpiece of art direction (Whale's and Charles D. Hall's), cinematography (John J. Mescall's), and music (Franz Waxman's). And there is the brilliantly edited set piece of the bride's creation, and Elsa Lanchester's performance as the bride that bookends the story with the wonderful prologue where she plays FRANKENSTEIN author Mary Shelley.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Both times, he sheds a tear. That was powerful.The bride is credited with a question mark in both the beginning and end, but she's Elsa Lanchester - the same person who plays Mary Shelley in the beginning of the film.

I liked the way the movie started with Mary Shelley telling the rest of the story. Best of all was the ""birth"" of the Bride-I loved her and wish I could have seen more of her.

212,cwkenreich,Poorly aged but the story is timeless,8,29 October 2021,"Another in the Universal Studios canon of classic horror monsters: the Bride of Frankenstein succeeds thematically but falls short technically. After the alleged victory during the final showdown in the original Frankenstein, the monster and Dr. Frankenstein himself are still alive. While ruminating on the consequences of his creation, the eccentric mind is pulled back into his pursuit of defying God via the encouragement of another scientist who seeks collaboration. When the cold-hearted monster somehow manages to learn about companionship while terrorizing the townspeople, he demands the creation of a Bride.While this is a critical element of the story, the title of the film can be misleading. It is only at the end when the bride of Frankenstein comes to life; however, themes of friendship and mairrage permeate the film entirely, even extending to Frankenstein's relationship with his fiancé. At the end, the monster is overcome with despondency upon realizing his bride doesn't mutually love him suggesting that love cannot be manufactured. One of the monster's less hostile encounters with humans is with a blind man who, unbeknown of the monster's appearance, strikes up a warm friendship that placates the monster (temporarily). Only when other men approach the situation that all potential to humanize the beast is marred. In my opinion, this scene outdoes the more sci-fi/horror-oriented moments because it expressed a universal message: we can find inner beauty if we are willing to put aside superficial appearances.The thrill level in the film is minimal, with Karloff's performance laughable but, nonetheless, remaining iconic: constantly shifting between the naivete of a child and the savagery of a bear. There is a sense of scale and some beautifully composed shots as evidenced by the opening and closing scenes. While not having watched the previous Frankenstein, it is not in my power to criticize any plot holes or confusing characters. Overall, Bride of Frankenstein works as a sequel; reinventing the film thematically while maintaining the pacing and gloomy atmosphere. It will remain an enduring classic from Universal in its youth.",The Bride of Frankenstein

This sequel gives us more insight into the character of the monster as we watch how he struggles with life, death, and what it means to be human. Boris Karloff's performance was just as exceptional in this film as the original.

217,gporcelli-41235,My favorite horror movie of all time!,10,20 May 2020,"Bride of Frankenstein (or more like Frankenstein part 2) is a direct sequel of Frankenstein by James Whale from 1932. I consider this sequel much better than the original because it successfully captures all the spirit and all the poetry of the novel by Mary Shelley by giving a huge psychological development to the monster (masterfully performed by Boris Karloff). In the first movie the monster was just a cold-blood murderous criminal. In this sequel he learns a lot from the world, life and people (he also learns to speak). It faithfully follows the events of the novel (almost); after being a friend with a blind fiddler (and after discovering how much is good to be loved), the monster turns back to his creator to force him to create a female mate for him (just like in the novel).
In the novel Frankenstein never creates a mate for his creature but in the movie he does.
Frankenstein successfully gives life to a woman but she quickly hates and escape from her male mate. After her rejectal the monster is resigned and decides to commit a suicide by destroying the laboratory with a huge explosion. Unforgettable are his words when his mate escapes form him ""She hates me, like everyone"" and before he destroys the lab ""We do belong to the death"". For the first time I felt sorry for the monster.Final verdict 10/10 (masterpiece)
Bride of Frankenstein is my favorite horror movie and people should watch it at least once in a lifetime.",The Bride of Frankenstein
218,hiproductions,I can't see what everyone is raving about: this was a bad pic,3,27 May 2005,"I regret to report that I did not find this movie enjoyable. In fact, I had a very difficult time staying awake during the screening even after a full nights rest. I haven't felt that way about a movie since being forced to watch science flicks in grade school. What turned me off was the confused genre. Was it a horror story or was it a Gothic romance? It wasn't much of either. It was fun to watch Boris Karloff clamber around like a silly over-sized idiot in undersized clothes (which also reminds me of myself in grade school) but that was about all that it offered me. I know I risk offending fans of this picture but I must be honest. There was nothing frightening about either monster character. Frankenstein was on screen so much that one would assume that the audience was expected to identify with him rather than fear him. If we were to identify with him then the story line and dialogue needed drastic overhauling to pull it off. I did like the scene with the old man. His being blind presented a message of beauty only being skin deep. The cigars and wine were ridiculous and I was again dozing off. I really enjoyed Elsa Lanchester as the bride (not as Shelley) and Whale only gave her a few brief moments. She jerked her head about and wildly looked about as if terrified by all of her surroundings. This was intriguing. Her head-splitting shriek also served the purpose of jarring me awake from the previous hours of mind numbing pseudo-acting.It appeared that Whale's use of shadow and light was good (old man's house and catacombs). Pretorius' little people in the jars also seemed to be a good attempt at special effect. Despite these attempts at quality there is nothing (outside of sound) that would distinguish this movie from films made 10 years earlier(the '20s) and there is nothing I would consider to be historic or amazing about this film except the fact that the viewing public has raved about it. This, I believe, says something about the viewing public.",The Bride of Frankenstein
219,zwrite2,Monster's development makes sequel better,8,22 November 2007,"If you want to see perhaps the best movie scene of all time, you should watch ""Bride of Frankenstein.""The scene I am referring to is a demonstration of why ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is a better movie than ""Frankenstein."" In the scene, The Monster walks into the tiny home of a blind, lonely and elderly man. Unaware of The Monster's looks, the old man reaches out to make the stranger his friend. As the friendship grows, the old man teaches his new friend how to talk.The 7- to 8-minute scene is simple and sentimental yet profound and instructive. It also shows what could have been achieved in the second half of ""Frankenstein"" if the plot hadn't inexplicably pivoted from a great science fiction movie centered on the development of The Monster into a weak horror story centered on the town's outrage.Boris Karloff reportedly objected to The Monster speaking in ""Bride."" He was wrong. The Monster's character development makes the sequel the superior movie. I found it enjoyable that The Monster learned, developed emotional feelings, yearned for friends and women, and enjoyed life. Grunting doesn't make a monster scarier. Intellectual growth does.But there are true horror scenes in this movie  at least intellectually. The scene with the little people created from seeds by Dr. Pretorius is humorous and scary to think about. ""Bride"" also benefits from the addition of a truly evil character although Dr. Pretorius is sometimes cartoonishly evil and the significantly less time that was spent on Dr. Frankenstein's boring love life.The creation scene in ""Frankenstein"" was one of that movie's highlights, but the creation scene of the bride in this movie is actually better. Less innovative perhaps, but more complex and interesting.Unfortunately, the ending of the movie was just plain awful. I wanted to see the character of the ""bride"" develop or at least begin to develop the way The Monster developed. I'm not sure whether I wanted to see a relationship between Dr. Frankenstein's two creations, but I certainly did not want to see the movie end minutes after they met.The movie should have been significantly longer. The ending was too rushed, too absurd, too contrived, and too preachy as suddenly The Monster became a moral arbiter of who is good and who is bad.The ending was so bad that I was tempted to cut my rating from 9 or 10 to 7, but I gave ""Frankenstein"" a 7 and ""Bride"" was definitely better. I gave it an 8.ZWrite",The Bride of Frankenstein
220,nbbaiyuchen,HVCC Student Yuchen Bai Review,9,10 February 2016,"A sequel to the film ""Frankenstein"" this film from director James Whale does a much more adequate job of showing the plight of the monster. In this film, i think ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is great, however, I felt like I wanted more of the bride than what was delivered. From the content that we can see Boris Karloff actually improves on his acting from the first and makes you feel for him in every moment throughout this film, and I will say that is the one aspect that was done better, emotion. The character of Frankenstein's Monster has much more to do here, but nobody else seems to be as motivated as he does for finding his mate. In a word, for me, i think this is a great classic film, and the content bring us not only the sensory stimulation, but also there are many reasons of people's life to follow.",The Bride of Frankenstein

I came to this conclusion knowing that when the film was made subliminal messaging was not deemed illegal. I'm yet to find out what hidden messages are in this movie, i'm sure when I do the government will erase me from existence.The best thing about this film was that it ended. (Which by the way couldn't come quick enough). I hated every miserable moment of this film which will inevitably haunt me for the rest of my life.",The Bride of Frankenstein
222,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,The First Classic Sequel To A Film,9,22 September 2020,"This is one of the first sequels that could probably be considered a classic along with its predecessor. The Bride of Frankenstein expanded upon the first film without changing a thing other than the hair color of Henry's bride from blond to brown. The character's hair also got significantly longer even though the movie occurred immediately after the first film. Mae Clarke was suffering some health issues (though what I cannot find) and Valerie Hobson who was 7 years younger than Clarke replaced her as Henry's fiancée, Elizabeth.One thing this film continues doing that the first one did was be impressionistic with its sets. The world is rendered to create a feel rather than rendered to be realistic. The sets bend and look like they were pulled from someone's feverish mind rather than be constructed.The Monster (Boris Karloff reprising the role and billed simply as Karloff) survived the fire by falling underground. Universal makeup artist Jack Pierce changed the eyes a little bit and removed the drooping eyelids. The Monster was even given skin burns and the hair was shortened to indicate it was burned as well. Pierce, during the course of the film, made changes to the makeup to indicate it was healing.Karloff this time was given lines having become even more famous. By now he was a horror icon have solidified that in the original The Mummy. The Monster is more a character here than just a simplistic sympathetic figure.There are a few things closely associated with Universal Pictures take on the Frankenstein Monster character that do not appear on film together. The first is Little Maria (Marilyn Harris) tossing flowers into the water and being drowned along with ""It's ALIVE!"" Those are in the first film. Next is the Bride and the scene with the hermit (O. P. Heggie) which doesn't occur until this film and quite possibly the thing most strongly associated with Frankenstein and the monster other than Henry is the character of Ygor (usually spelled Igor in non-Universal versions) who doesn't show up until the third film and is played by Bela Lugosi.Speaking of Elsa Lanchester, what an iconic creature design. Somehow they took random pieces of cloth and a tricked out wig and made an image that has stuck with audiences from the time it hit the screen until now. She did more in the opening scene as Mary Shelley than she did as The Monster's Bride, but everyone remembers her as just The Monster's Bride.The Monster was a little more tragic here. He was unaware of his own brute strength to an extent, but now he knew he was alone. Hence he forced the doctor to craft him a bride who upon being brought to life rejected him with a hiss. In the hermit he made a friend but the people that were hunting him would not let be with that friend. He had gone from a murderous beast to a misunderstood individual. He was truly alone.I, like many others, enjoy the story a little more here. It continued the narrative begun in the first film as well as expanding the mythology. The Monster was made into something a bit better than before with the simple addition of speech. Whale felt he could not duplicate what he had done previously so he decided to make it ""a real hoot"" in his words. And it most definitely is. He just went all out here and decided to have fun. And sometimes that is the better route than trying do an exact copy of what was done first. It certainly was here.Bride of Frankenstein is one of the best sequels ever and definitely one of the first sequels to ever be considered a classic alongside the original. It is a wonderful movie that while not scary is still as good as the original was. You cannot go wrong with this classic.",The Bride of Frankenstein
223,Tduma91,Certainly not the original...,5,5 May 2011,"I don't know. That's probably a poor way to start a review but it's the feeling I left this film with. I think the acting was just as great as the original but I didn't really like the film due to it's plot, unrelated events and cheesy secondary characters (the blind man). I feel like this was a cheap shot to cash in on the success of the original. I've seen many reviews contrary to this belief but the original had much more feeling to it and I was much more sympathetic toward The Monster. He brutally murders Dr. Pretorious for no apparent reason as the viewer is the only one who knows of Dr. Pretorious' behind the scenes motives. Unfortunately I feel like this film brings nothing additional to the table when following the original and quite frankly I'm tired of this being considered one of the best sequels ever made. I don't mean to offend any fans of the film but in what way does this stand up to the work of The Godfather II which can be argued as better than the original (which ranks in practically every top films list known to man). Maybe it's just me but I don't see this film as a classic of the horror genre as I'd much rather watch the original Frankenstein or Dracula before I took this one in again. It gets a 5 just because it's well shot and contains good acting.",The Bride of Frankenstein

"" , "" Did he have feelings? "", "" Could he be taught into a nicer person than he was? "" All this done in 70 so minutes is remarkable.Today an average movie is 100-110 Min's or even more and still the message is not conveyed.I simply love this movie and recommend everyone to own it as it is something that even after 74 years seems a fresh type of movie.",The Bride of Frankenstein
225,tommyknobnocker,Great Black and White Monster Movie,9,13 October 2010,"I usually prefer my monster movies in glorious color, so I can enjoy the splatter, but ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" really defied my expectations.First of all, Frankenstein is really a monster to be reckoned with. He might be a little sluggish, but he's got some major steroid action going on.Second, the film is laced with some effective humor. I wouldn't call this a true horror movie because it's not really scary. There are large chunks of it that are played for comedy.The only reason I demoted it a star was because of the opening sequence, which comes across as dated.

226,mxddiie07,It's alive!!!!!!,8,16 February 2021,"James Whale has done it again. This sequel topped off the first film and it's surely deserved. The plot of this film was beyond what anyone expected of it. It took the twists and turns that no one saw coming, but looking back they were quite necessary to put the film at this rating. There were some points during the film that weren't needed and that dragged the storyline too far. There was a lot of repetitive qualities to this sequel, which kind of overshadowed each repeat that occurred that made it obvious how repetitive it got. Having our old characters met new characters gave a fresh taste to what this sequel offered. One could pull apart how there was only two original characters surrounded by recasts, but you have to realize not everyone can make it into every single film. Luckily, that wasn't a big drawback to the film; at least to me. The sound of the film was perfect. It hit all the right notes at the right time and was never too much or too little. Especially for a horror film! I found that this sequel didn't hold as high of a impression as Frankenstein did. This is because some lack of special effects that were used in the first film didn't carry over into this one. Aside from all of this, I think the the last twenty minutes of the film really sealed just how impressive this sequel was. It was visually very pleasing, especially those dutch angles!",The Bride of Frankenstein

It has the same feel, most of the same cast with some nice new editions, the lighting is that same intense contrasted lighting of the first film, and the cinematography is just as good too. I loved the first film and I think the second film is just as good. The even better thing about this film is that we really get to understand the monster more, see the transformation in him, and learn more about what it really means to be human.

228,Kieranmc,Anarchy rules supreme,10,26 April 2000,"Anarchy rules supreme in this glorious gothic fantasy. Based loosely, very loosely, on characters from Mary Shelly's gothic romance the film gleefully assaults sacred institutions; religion, marriage etc. I first saw Bride of Frankenstein as a child and was hooked. It really isn't a horror in the accepted sense of the word. The physical horror is overshadowed by the obvious delight Whale and his cast take in parody and satire. Only as an adult did I realise that this is a gay classic. Whale and his cast are all gay; Elsa Lanchester was married to Charles Laughton. Bride of Frankenstein exudes a finely honed camp sensitivity. It's one of the great 'horror' films of it's era and well worth a visit; or a re-visit.",The Bride of Frankenstein

I personally thought that it may have been better than the original. I thought it was really cool how they gave the monsters more human like characteristics, for example talking more. The monster was longing to be accepted. His appearance and growls frightened people. Because of what he was people were constantly afraid of him. There was a theme in this being that people should not be judged by their appearance. The music was almost comical in how dramatic it was. The music helped foreshadow many events. The lighting was very dim and dark which I thought helped create the mood perfectly. To think that this film was made in 1935 seems so impressive. It really had some great special effects. Classic horror films like this cannot be compared to any of the modern day.",The Bride of Frankenstein
230,Dave Banks,Always fun to watch,9,24 June 2003,"I just read a review by a ""newbie"" that slams this film. According to said ""newbie"", this is a bad film that is not scary ""like other horror films"". I'm guessing that the film is not scary enough for the newbie because it shows no graphic details of someone's head being chopped off, eyeballs gouged out, or total dismemberment. Sadly, that's what the film industry shovels out to the ""short attention span"" generation that pays tremendously inflated prices to sit in a crowded, noisy theater and watch what passes for a ""Horror"" film today.I make it a point to watch Bride Of Frankenstein, every time it's on TCM. One mark of a really great movie is that, even with repeated showings, the viewer can find something new and interesting each time they watch the film. ""Bride"" definitely achieves this characteristic.Of course, like most others, I have some favorite scenes that I eagerly await each time I view this classic. Foe me, one of the true highlights is the scene with the Monster and the blind hermit. Both of the actors in this scene are absolutely masterful. When the volume of the music (Ave Maria) is increased and we see the tear running down the face of the monster, we are witnessing (IMHO) one of the greatest scenes in movie history. Boris Karloff was a wonderful actor and his abilities are well showcased in this superb film.",The Bride of Frankenstein
231,michel_broeders,Do you like gin? It is my only weakness,10,21 October 2018,"Universal had to wait almost four years before director Jame Whale accepted the offer to direct a sequel to Frankenstein, his big blockbuster from 1931. Based upon Mary Shelley's timeless novel, and once again starring Boris Karloff as the inimitable monster, The Bride of Frankenstein follows immediately upon the events of the first film.Henry Frankenstein no longer wants to create life from death. The monster, created by him, causes great mayhem and together with his old mentor Dr. Pretorius, Henry is persuaded in creating a mate for his monster.Although Boris Karloff wasn't easily convinced, it was decided that the monster should speak. This gives Karloff's performance a great duality; a frightening monster for whom the viewer has a great empathy. The humanization makes him more complete and is more consistent with the character of Mary Shelley's novel. It also makes his desperate search for a comrade more emotional. The Monster's bride, played by Elsa Lanchester, is one of the greatest, most iconic performances in horror-film history, although she only appears for a mere moment on screen.The greatness of this film lies in the fast conversions from the daunting to the comical. Whales' special sense of humor is particularly evident in the character of the maid Minnie (Una O'Connor) and the effeminate portrayal of Ernest Thesiger (the devilish Dr. Pretorius). In addition to the sublime direction of Whale, the technical aspects are extraordinary. Much of what made this film so popular are the special effects by John P. Fulton, the music by Franz Waxman, and the make-up by Jack Pierce.The Bride of Frankenstein is a surprising mix of horror and comedy, which in many respects became superior to its predecessor.",The Bride of Frankenstein

So I watched it a second time and  I came to appreciate all the symbolism in the film.  I now believe this is the most meaningful horror film of all time.  But dont see it as just a horror movie but a film that is making social commentary about religion.",The Bride of Frankenstein
233,pietoso,A Worthy Companion,8,28 September 2020,"Bride of Frankenstein is, unlike most sequels today, a complete improvement over its predecessor, preserving Frankenstein's best elements while outclassing it in almost every other category. Boris Karloff and Colin Clive make an excellent return, both overshadowing their earlier performances with no lack of style, while actors such as Ernest Thesiger make their diabolically well-conceived debuts. Bride is often a visual feast as well, exhibiting brilliant conception in its sets and cinematography, whether the camera finds itself again glaringly latched upon the Monster's ghastly face and shark-like eyes, or measuredly lounging in an Elysian forest scene. The picture's score deserves special praise in this case: adaptive and evocative, it frequently heightens the emotional impact of each scene no matter the locale. This film, despite its horror-bound nature, often finds its strength in quieter moments, and the scenes of the hermit and the Monster finding unorthodox friendship in each other's company are particularly moving. It would be a mortal sin not to finally mention Elsa Lanchester, whose performance as the Bride is wonderful in its inhuman and unearthly grace, complete with exceptionally hideous vocalizations that the actress herself stated were inspired by the hissing of swans (notoriously awful creatures). Overall, Bride is a surprisingly well-made followup to the original, far more deserving than any other film in the WB universe of the reputation the memory of Frankenstein possesses.",The Bride of Frankenstein

235,changedname,"""I'm lonely, are you lonely too? Let's be friends!"" This movie is LAME!!!!",4,4 April 2010,"That isn't an actual quote from the movie, but the quotes ran very similar to it. I think it sums up much of the morality and preachiness in the movie. The film starts out pretty well with Mary Shelley and two of her colleagues in a large room with a terrible thunderstorm outside. I actually found this part of the movie kind of interesting, unlike a lot of the rest of it. Some of the scenes are really good, the actors are great for what what have to work with. Ernest Thesiger plays a BRILLIANT mad scientist and is really convincing in it and enjoyable to watch. Colin Clive also plays a great role as ""Henry Frankenstein"" (the monster's creator in this movie), and I liked all of the actors EXCEPT for Karloff, who does nothing but grunt and act like an uninspired ape. I'm not blaming the actor, but it's hard to play a good inanimate object. But the main three performers (Elizabeth, Henry, Dr. Pretorius) are all very good melodramatic actors. Frankenstein is more Sci-Fi/Dystopian rather than horror. It has always been about feelings, the perils of playing with science, and nobody who knows the story will expect to be scared by the monster himself (even though he does nonchalantly kill in the film). But I just didn't feel anything in this film, it was far too simple. I 100% didn't buy into any of it at all, I thought it was absurd. The imagery in the film is fine, the visuals that you can see for example in the action sequences are of a very high standard at times. The opening scene images are great. They're not mindblowing or anything though. Too much time in the movie is dedicated to ""cutting edge"" film technology, such as driving up the machine near the end and even that of the little people (which is an okay clip but has no real meaning at all for the film, it's as though they just threw it in). I'm sorry but the cutting edge of film ""effects"" of 1935 aren't likely to impress people in 2010, we've seen it all before and if they last too long the clips become very tiresome. A big lever and a few lights may have been enough to impress the audiences back then but not today!!! But overall I'm generally positive about the imagery, it's the plot, dialogue and pacing that destroy it for me. At one point in the film Frankenstein goes to a blind man and the blind man tells him he is so lonely and he wants him to be his friend. I don't mind the idea of it, but this scene went on and on and on for about 15 minutes! (or at least what seemed that length of time). Frankenstein is afraid of fire, and the man keeps telling him ""no, no, it's okay, fire can be good"". Blind or not, what kind of an old man just accepts a stranger into his home like that and treats him like an old friend? It would scarcely be believable if the guy was normal and explained his story to him, but as it is, with him having to explain to him that fire is okay, I just cannot believe it. Frankenstein speaks ""tarzan"" English, it is like listening to someone talking to someone who cannot speak English or a man from an indigenous tribe. Imagine the frustration involved in trying to speak with that person and you'll get some idea of the ludicrousness of his dialogue. The plot doesn't go anywhere! The whole point of the movie revolves around them making a bride for Frankenstein. Then no sooner is she made she rejects him and the movie ends. Frankenstein VERY unrealistically blames Dr. Pretorius and cruelly kills him in the end saying ""We belong dead."". This is ridiculous because Frankenstein had only been helped by Pretorius, even though he appeared ""evil"" to us, not to Frankenstein. At the very start of the film they think Henry is dead and are mourning him, but he suddenly wakes up for no apparent reason and there's no mention of it ever again. What the hell was the point of that?! This movie had a lot of potential with great acting and even some great scenes. They could have kept a lot of it, scrapped Frankenstein talking, scrapped the vast majority of the blind man scene and had the rest of the movie with Frankenstein and his Bride having sex and being caught by one of the villages who thought it was an act against God. Then them being cruelly chased with Henry Frankenstein trying to stop them but to no avail. The end could have them eloping together on a ship for ""new lands"" or something, with the evil Dr. Pretorius involved nefariously some way in that.",The Bride of Frankenstein

238,OldTree,The great hermit sequence,10,27 December 1998,"Everything in this horror film (actually a black fairy tale) is elaborately done. The hermit sequence (especially part 2) is perhaps the best that I have ever seen.It's a pleasure to watch Boris Karloff in his world-famous monster make-up how he eats bread and drinks wine. From here on Karloff masterfully shows very different kind of emotions within a short time. First there is enjoyment resulting from good eating and drinking. Then the hermit lights a match - even this tiny flame frightens Karloff a lot (he's terribly scared of fire). He finally takes the offered cigar and puffs with great pleasure. A few moments later he is very serious and gulps (an expression of pain because the smoke has got into his lung). That's not only a subtle gag (a normal person who inhales for the first time would have a coughing fit), but also a perfect transition. The hermit says: It is bad to be alone."" Karloff responds: ""Alone bad (he's reminded what the world has to offer for him: rejection) - friend good"". Now he smiles because he finally has found a friend (the twist is: only this blind old man is able to ""see"" his inner goodness).At the end of this great sequence the hermit plays a happy tune on the violin. Karloff is relaxed, smokes and makes rhythmic movements to the music. Since one knows that he is also scared of dogs, director Whale informs the viewer acoustically that danger is approaching: a short howl of a dog is to hear. Then, a few seconds later, two hunters enter the hut (no dog is with them) and immediately the scene ends in terror.",The Bride of Frankenstein

Horror, rue, and gut-busters all dwell under the same runtime, and admittedly, my cinematic bread & butter is the kind of movie that can fuse genre and mood and still be of a piece, but a lot of these movies don't quite hang together. I will say that I'm crushing super hard on Elsa Lanchester, who burns on the screen like a no-frills, spectral version of Rose McGowan or something. One of my favorite scenes is when the monster growls his way into a hermitage.

241,d-touponse,Bride of Frankenstein (1935),9,6 October 2017,"Frankenstein was a well developed movie that really showed the animations of the monster and how the monster originated. In the first movie people viewed it how even though you feel empathetic to the monster, the way he was created was so barbaric that he had to be destroyed. Viewers didn't get to really know the monster, they just knew that he was a dangerous killer that barely knew anything about the world. He was just filled with rampage and anger. In the sequel it shows how he connects with another person (the blind man) which in the first movie it showed he was completely incapable of that. The sequel humanized the monster, made him able to speak, to want and search for another soul that understood him, and/or possibly love him. This made you almost feel sorry for him, but unfortunately for this character life is only pain.",The Bride of Frankenstein
242,theodore_varengo,James Whale's masterpiece,10,22 April 2007,"This film had several things stacked against it going into production, potentially preventing it from being as great as it is: for one thing, sequels rarely equal the original film in quality, and James Whale was reluctant to return to the Frankenstein story after the first film, so one might have thought he wouldn't put his heart into the project. Another thing that could have worked against the film is that it is immediately obvious that they had a much higher budget and there is a slickness that wasn't present in the original. The relative crudeness of FRANKENSTEIN worked in its favor; the smaller budget and lack of a score only added to its weirdness.Fortunately, James Whale overcame all of these factors (including his initial reluctance) and delivered not only one of the greatest horror films ever made, but probably one of the greatest films ever made in any genre. Just compare the scene of Frankenstein and Pretorius bringing the Bride to life to the equivalent creation scene in the original movie and you'll see how they ramped everything up to a whole new level for this picture. The editing, the production design, the sets, the performances, are so over the top yet dead on it almost creates a giddiness or a frenzied feeling for the viewer. In fact, as the movie progresses, the editing becomes more frantic, the camera angles more abstract, the overall effect more otherworldly. By the creation scene, the film feels half-crazed, the viewer somehow intoxicated. Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius as absolutely brilliant, his performance equaling that of any contemporary actor, and Colin Clive delivers yet another delightfully manic performance as a Henry Frankenstein torn between what is morally right and scientific curiosity. But of course it is Boris Karloff who gives an outstanding performance as the Monster (duly credited this time instead of being billed as ""?"" as he was in the first movie), one that may even bring you to tears he when befriends a blind hermit.There is a great deal more humor in this film, most of it delivered by Thesiger in laugh-out-loud lines that are not funny at all taken out of context (""You're wise in your generation"" for example), and I don't want to ruin any of the witty and florid dialogue for you. The film careens wildly from humor to pathos, creepiness to zaniness, in a roller coaster ride of styles and emotions. The slickness doesn't detract from the atmosphere, and since the first film was an enormous hit for Universal, to try and duplicate the low-budget look of the first film would have been pretentious.This is just about as close to a perfect movie that one will encounter, and certainly a perfect Universal horror flick. And who wouldn't enjoy that?",The Bride of Frankenstein
243,sevenup@neo.rr.com,The Return Of Frankenstein,10,19 April 2005,"When this writer saw Boris Karloff play Frankenstein's Monster,I felt like I was seeing this great movie monster truly live. This classic stars the great Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster with this star getting top billing as Karloff.With Colin Clive continuing to portray Baron Henry Frankenstein,Valerie Hobson now taking over in some inspired casting as his love Elizabeth,the witty Ernest Thesiger portraying the maddest of all scientists:Dr.Pretorius and Elsa Lanchester as both Mary Shelley (in a prologue)and later as the monster's mate who is christened as the ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" by a gleeful Dr.Pretorius.The film does have it's humorous moments chiefly supplied by Thesiger's Pretorius. Humor is also added by Una O'Connor as Castle Frankenstein's busybody servant named Minnie, Dwight Frye returns as a grave robber/murderer named Karl who works for Pretorius and E.E. Clive as the pompous Burgomeister who sports a moustache that would seem to be at home in a Hal Roach or Mack Sennett comedy. In the beginning of the film after the mill has been burned to the ground,it is E.E. Clive's Burgomeister who declares to villagers, ""you may thank your lucky stars that they sent for me to safeguard life and property!"" Hoots the boisterous and sarcastic Minnie,""why didn't you safeguard those what lies drowned and murdered?!!""Karloff's Monster appears first in the underground cistern(Karloff was in great pain during the making of this film because he had injured his hip during the scenes in the cistern}that is below the now smoldering remnants that was once a functioning windmill.He escapes the cistern by killing both parents of the little Maria (who he'd accidentally drowned because he thought she'd float like the flowers she was throwing in the lake in ""Frankenstein""(1931)).The burned Monster escapes to the countryside.For dramatic effect,it appears that Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein is dead(he helped the villagers try to destroy his Monster but received for his courage a fall from the top of the burning mill by his own monster)but after he is returned to his family's castle and everyone is mourning over the young monster maker's remains the formerly 'dead' Baron Frankenstein now stirs and Valerie Hobson's tearful Elizabeth embraces her now living ,but very injured love.Near the end of Frankenstein's recovery, he is visited one late evening by Ernest Thesiger's Dr. Pretorius who as Henry tells his fiancée that Pretorius was,""... my teacher.But was..."" Interrupts a sneering Pretorius,""...but was booted out.Booted my dear Baron for knowing too much.""He convinces the reluctant Henry Frankenstein to come with him to his residence and see his success...says Pretorius,""for I too, have created life"".Henry Frankenstein is now too curious to pass up this opportunity to see his former teacher's success at creating life.Later, Frankenstein sees Dr. Pretorius' work which consists of one of the most famous scenes in movie history;a variety of glass jars with a tiny person living in each one...it's a scene straight out of an alchemist's dreams of success. Says Clive's Frankenstein about these tiny creations,""but this isn't science!It's more like black magic!"" Announces an angry Pretorius with words that have long ago become a cliché for the mad scientist,""you think I'm mad!"" But this mad scientist's purpose for bringing the young Frankenstein to his home and showing him his work is too get the mostly healed monster maker to collaborate with him on making ""...a woman.Now that would be really interesting!""However,Henry refuses.Boris Karloff's monster has been made more humane in this film and he is taught to speak.Later the Monster makes his way to a cemetery where he hides from some villagers by escaping into the bowels of an underground tomb. The mad Pretorius who,after stealing a woman's skull and bones from a coffin,dines on top of it with a meal of cold chicken and wine. The Monster approaches Pretorius( not unnerved in the least)and they become friends. At Castle Frankenstein, Henry continues to refuse to help so firstly,Pretorius reintroduces Frankenstein to his now verbally demanding Monster.The scene begins as a recreation of that famous scene in ""Frankenstein""(1931) when the new Monster is ordered by Henry Frankenstein to,""...sit down.""Except in this scene it is the Monster ordering his creator to,""...sit down!"" The Monster and Pretorius both try to browbeat Frankenstein into creating a female mate for his Creature but the scientist continues to refuse.Pretorius orders the Monster to leave as Henry Frankenstein continues to refuse the pairs' demands.However,Pretorius finally persuades the monster maker to help him when for a finale to his visit,he has the Monster kidnap Elizabeth(now Henry's new bride). When Henry Frankenstein calls his servants together to form search parties;the domineering Dr.Pretorius throws a gigantic vase to the castle floor to get everyone's attention.He succeeds.Shouts the now humorless Pretorius,""I charge you!As you value your mistresses' life to do nothing and say nothing!"" Frankenstein and Pretorius along with two assistants(one is Dwight Frye's Karl)return to the old watchtower where Frankenstein first made his Monster. They work day and night now on what will be The Bride Of Frankenstein with Pretorius having grown her a brain organically.In scenes that are classic motion picture history,Colin Clive with his usual enthusiasm shouts,""she's alive!Alive!"" Elsa Lanchester's performance as the Bride is legendary.She moves her head like a bird,makes choking sounds ,hisses and when the Monster finally sees her she screams at him.Once again he tries to get her to like him but she screams wildly at this final attempt. Declares Karloff's heartbroken Monster,""she hate me...like others!""This Monster discovers an enormous lever that will blowup the laboratory and when he's warned by Dr.Pretorius,""don't touch that lever!You'll blow us all to atoms"" Suddenly Elizabeth appears outside the closed laboratory door desperately pulling at the handle and screaming for Henry.The Monster allows his maker and his maker's wife to leave while Pretorius and the Monster's disapproving Bride remain behind as the watchtower blows up around them.Henry and Elizabeth are now outside as he embraces his shaken wife.",The Bride of Frankenstein
244,seinfeldbenes11,The best monster movie of the 1930s!,10,8 March 2019,"Frankenstein(1931) was a terrifying experience for cinema-goers at it's time, but James Whale's greatest masterpiece in undoubtedly Bride of Frankenstein.Bride of Frankenstein is one of those rare sequels that manage to be even better than the original. After re-watching my Universal Monster's boxset, it's quite clear that Bride of Frankenstein is on a different league when compared to other movies of the set. Bride has a better score, a more gothic atmosphere, subtle homosexual undertones, blasphemous imagery, greater acting and directing. It's the masterpiece of the set, the most daring horror movie of the 1930s that should be watched by every cinema-lover",The Bride of Frankenstein
245,mortis5555,Pretty good,5,10 August 2001,"Fast forward through the horrid opening scene with Mary Shelley. That scene alone deducted 2 points from my rating of the film. It has nothing to do with the story anyway.  After that, it's a pretty good movie, especially for one from the 1930s. I remember reading the book Frankenstein, Victor decided against making a mate for his creation because he was afraid she might not like him, and that it would make the monster even more angry. I liked that they went with that.",The Bride of Frankenstein
246,crisso,Welcome to Whale's world...,10,30 August 2002,"Forget the likes of ""The Godfather II"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is THE greatest example of a sequel completely surpassing the original in terms of sheer brilliance. Coming four years after the original 'Frankenstein' in 1931, director James Whale was originally reluctant to make a sequel but changed his mind after being allowed to make the film more on his own terms. No other director has ever managed to blend horror, comedy and pathos as successfully Whale. The film features some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, notably the monster's encounter with a lonely hermit and the introduction of 'The Bride'. The film has it all: superb casting, tremendous sets and make up, memorable dialogue (""To a new world of Gods and monsters"") and a brilliant score by Franz Waxman. Boris Karloff must surely be one of the greatest actors to ever appear on film. He manages to improve on his initial characterisation of the Monster, due mainly to the addition of dialogue (""Friends, good!""), and, unlike in the first movie, actually makes us feel total empathy for the Monster. Colin Clive returns as the reluctant Doctor F, Una O'Connor makes a wonderful addition as the twittering and hysterical Minnie, but it is Ernest Thesiger who steals the film with his hilarious performance (""Have a cigar. They are my only weakness"") as the sinister Dr. Pretorious. Although Elsa Lanchester appears as the Bride for only about 2 minutes at the film's finale, it will be the role for which she is forever associated. The film is regarded as the high point of the Universal horror series and stands as a testament to the genius of James Whale.",The Bride of Frankenstein

251,Cruentus1,"A Fairly Good Sequel, But Does Not Surpass the Original",7,13 November 2006,"The majority of film critics are of the opinion that Bride of Frankenstein is the rare sequel that surpasses the original, in this case the majority is wrong.Bride of Frankenstein is a fairly entertaining movie that surpasses the original on technical merits only. It is very obvious, when comparing the two, that ""Bride"" was produced with a much larger budget than the original. The beautiful cinematography, and lavish, well designed sets make wonderful eye candy.The actors playing the main characters all do a fantastic job. Elsa Lanchester, playing dual roles as Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and the Monster's mate, is stunningly beautiful -- both with and without her ""Bride"" makeup.This production also has some very glaring problems that keep it from greatness.First, there are continuity problems when compared with the original film. Why, for instance, were the names of reoccurring characters changed? There appears to be no good reason except for sloppiness. How did Dr. Frankenstein get to be the Baron? What happened to his father? This is never explained. Admittedly these are minor problems, but it wouldn't have been all that difficult to tie up loose ends. Sloppy.While we're on the topic of changed character names, why did the ""Monster"" murder the parents of the little girl that he accidentally killed in the first movie? In the first movie it is clear that the ""Monster"" drowns the little girl by accident. After he kills the child, he is horrified by his own actions and shows shock and remorse. The murder of the girl's parents, in the the second film, are done out of pure malice. What is the point? The ""little people"" scene with Dr. Pretorius(Ernest Thesiger) takes the movie from the realm of science fiction into that of fantasy. It is totally out of place in this film, even the character of Dr. Frankenstein comments on this by saying, ""This is more black magic than science."" This one scene very badly damages what is otherwise a fine performance by Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius. BTW, Ernest Thesiger's character of Dr. Pretorius is the very definition of ""mad scientist"".The ""comic"" character of Minnie, played by Una O'Connor, is beyond stupid and annoying. The only people who will be entertained by the cackling, screaming ""Minnie"" character are mouth-breathing, knuckle-draggers that make the ""Monster"" look like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz by comparison.Finally, the biggest problem with this film is the limited amount of time given to the ""Bride"". The ""Bride"" is revealed. The ""Monster"" is rejected. The ""Monster"" blows up the lab with everyone in it. End of story. All this in the last 10 minutes.The story really should have started after the ""Bride"" was animated. It would have been much more interesting to watch the characters of the ""Bride"" and the ""Monster"" develop and interact and eventually lead to some tragic ending. Instead we get a comic book hack ending with the ""Monster"" pulling the ""self destruct lever"".Bride of Frankenstein: Missed opportunity.",The Bride of Frankenstein
252,donsulli,"Great film, but so-so horror",8,4 December 2007,"It's okay to have a few lighter moments in a horror film--even desirable because it enhances the horror. But Bride of Frankenstein had many funny scenes where scary scenes were few and far between (though it opened with one, where the woman pulls the monster from the water, thinking it's her husband.) I would call it a good movie, but not a good horror flick. Of the first three Frankenstein films I think Frankenstein was very scary, but son of Frankenstein was the scariest.Also, the monster's ability to talk diminished his mystique and horrifying characteristics. As a mute monster, Karloff does a superb acting job in projecting the monster's emotions with gestures, facial expressions, and actions.",The Bride of Frankenstein
253,jckogel,Great Film,10,1 July 2014,"I watched both ""Frankenstein"" and its sequel ""Bride of Frankenstein"" today. Both films look fabulous in their new bu-ray editions. Karloff's performance is wonderful in both films, but in ""Bride"", his character as the monster is humanized to a point that we all can relate to for wanting to be accepted for who we are. All the ""monster"" wanted was to be accepted for what he was. He wanted a friend. Only director James Whale could get that across in the 30s as a gay man who was likely trying to be accepted also. The last 20 minutes of this film exhibits some of the best photography in any film when the bride is revealed. For a ""horror"" film, they never made them better. I would rank this is as one the best films ever produced by Universal Pictures, director James Whale, actor Boris Karloff and the supporting cast.

254,vb-49213,COLIN CLIVE IS AT IT AGAIN!,8,17 August 2020,"It was a dark and stormy night. Outside a large English mansion, a tremendous thunderstorm is at its height. Inside are Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly (Elsa Lanchester), her husband Percy (Douglas Walton), and their friend Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon). Mary decides that a night like this would be a good time to tell the rest of the story of ""Frankenstein."" No, the Monster did not die in the windmill fire. (Of course not. How else could they make a sequel?) He's alive, and roaming about the countryside, while Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is in the middle of a nervous breakdown. He's being comforted by Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson), his wife, when they receive a strange visitor, Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger).
He has a proposition for Henry. Why don't the two of them team up, find a female body, and give the Monster a mate? Henry won't hear of it, but then Pretorius reminds him of what happened in the first movie. ""You really are responsible for all those murders, you know."" When Henry continues to resist, he employs Plan B. Frankie will kidnap Elizabeth and keep her in a secret location. When their work is done, she will be returned to Henry.
The Monster is viewed much more sympathetically in this movie than in the first one. He's a tortured soul, looking for a friend. The scene with the hermit in the cottage is quite well done. Two lonely people-one who cannot see, the other who cannot speak-become friends. The blind man eats, drinks, and smokes with the Monster. He plays the violin and teaches him a few simple words. (Karloff was opposed to the Monster speaking, but as a studio contract player, he had little control over script content.)
Of course, this peace and harmony cannot last. A couple of lost hunters (one of whom is a very young John Carradine) stop by to ask for directions. Seeing the monster, they raise their guns. In the ensuing fight, the cottage catches fire. Frankenstein is once again alone, wandering through the forest. Everyone who sees him screams and runs away.
Meanwhile back at the lab, Henry and Pretorius are just about finished with their work. Although she gets no credit at the end of the film, when they remove the bandages it's clear that the Monster's mate is Elsa Lanchester. Now that their work is over, Elisabeth is released and arrives at the castle. As Frankie tries to get to first base with his new bride, she screams at him (twice). ""She hate me-like others."" Frankenstein tells Henry and Elizabeth to go, but Pretorius must stay. ""We belong dead."" As Henry and Elizabeth run away, Frankenstein pulls a lever that destroys the entire castle.",The Bride of Frankenstein

The atmosphere evoked from the sets is near perfect, and although actually filmed on the Universal back-lot, you can believe that you are being led through a 19th century Bavaria. Although Karloff portrayed the monster only 3 times, this was undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career, and the film that most fans will remember him for. Mention should also be made of the excellent performance given by Ernest Thesiger as Doctor Pretorious. I've been interested in movies since I was 4 years old and have ""Bride of Frankenstein"" to thank for that. Superb.",The Bride of Frankenstein
256,lauren-hicks,A Sequel worth doing!,8,5 December 2007,"I began to watch this movie and was lost from the first second of dialogue. I eventually caught on to the fact that it was a sequel of James Whale's first movie Frankenstein made in 1931. I highly recommend that any viewer see the first movie before watching this one. Just like all other sequels you could be lost. The flashbacks are a great help to remind people of the original story line. Flashbacks were a very crucial part of numerous old black and white films. They are, to this day, also very important to a sequel or trilogy that is made several years after the previous movie. Also, most black and white films made in the 30's and 40's have trouble with the lighting. When a director wants to make something look like it is appearing at night, the darkness can ruin the object in the shot. Whale gave the nightly appearance very well when shooting at buildings. He kept the right amount of light in the background not to get in the way of it being to light. I felt that the angles the director took to place the characters in specific lighting added to the drama, horror, and sci-fi genre this movie is placed in. The lit candles used in older versions of movies add to the horror of a movie. With every scary horror movies comes great scary characters. The actors played a wonderful part in this. Boris Karloff, The Monster, and Ernest Thesiger, Dr. Pretorius, gave a remarkable dark and scary performance as a monster and mad scientist. The music, to today's' generations, does not hinder the story or make it cheesy by any means. It is the classic, old, scary organ like music that gives hope, despair, and fear to every shot. Music has always defined a critical point a scene for movies. That is also the reason why soundtracks are made after movies are released because we relate a specific song with a specific movie. This is one reason why this particular movies music nominated it for an Oscar in 1936, only a year after its release date. James Whale is a native of the English country side. In the Bride of Frankenstein, he does a great job of using English dialogue and clothing to help accent the age of the movie. He uses the English royalty line to show power and what happens when it is abused and misused. Despite the good shots that were taken, some of the close ups were numerous in their appearances. I had trouble telling where the climax of the movie was, but caught back up with the movie. There are small subtle moments in the movie that are outdated for the twenty first century to hold in a movie. You could tell when Whale was using certain things that were obviously fake in their entirety. For being a movie that plays for an hour and thirty minutes, the story builds up fast and has some holes in the plot. There are pieces that could have been used better in the overall film, as well. Overall the performances were strong and the shots flowed well. I would love to discuss it further in detail but can not because I do not want to spoil anything. The opening of Bride of Frankenstein finds the similarity between the ending and another part of the movie with romance. This movie shows a great love story hidden behind the parallels of an emotionless and friendless monster and his want not to be alone. Hence, one of the reasons why this movie has been classified as a drama, romance, and sci-fi. This movie also speaks another motif of life and death. Most people, in their explanation of any Frankenstein movie, would say that it is about giving life and eventually ending in death. You do not know whose life while come to end or even when it will occur or how. However, James Whale with the first and second Frankenstein movies has contributed to another power that we can show to have a small portion of control over. The sad fact of the matter is that Whale lost the control of his life and committed suicide only twenty two years later after this movie was made. I give this movie an eight out of ten because I am sure that it frightened most people upon its release in the 1930's. Also, because it has miniature twists and turns around every bricked corner. Every shot helps the next to give the story line strength and fill the hour and thirty minutes that it was asked of. I definitely recommend this movie for any viewers that wish to see an old black and white film that keeps to the traditional scary, yet somehow lovable monster and quirky scientists. For the twenty first century viewers, it would appear to be a movie filled with some laughter and wonderment.",The Bride of Frankenstein

258,j-hicks-09,"A tale of the joy of companionship, and the pain of rejection.",10,15 March 2010,"Spoiler Alert!!This instant classic was released in 1935 as a sequel to the famed horror film based on the novel by Mary Shelly. This story of the importance of companionship and the anguish of rejection is stellar in its era of production. In the film the character of Dr. Frankenstein is reprised by Colin Clive. His monster is, once again, played by the immortal Boris Karloff. Dr. Frankenstein's Fiancé is played by Ms. Valarie Hobson, and we are also introduced to a new major player, Dr. Pretorius, played by Ernest Thesinger.The film is a continuation of the original story, which ended rather abruptly. We rejoin a mob of angry town's people just after the burning of the mill. As the remnants of the building continue to smolder, the town's people, assuming that the monster has perished in the fire, collect the body of Dr. Frankenstein, and carry him back to the castle, fearing he is dead. Unknown to all but the last few stragglers, however, we discover that the monster has indeed survived the fire, and still in a rage. He kills those who are left at the mill, leaving only Dr. Frankenstein's housekeeper to witness his resurgence. As he remains on the run, he encounters, by chance, a blind man who takes him in and teaches him a few basic words, along with the meaning of companionship.It is then that we return to the castle, and learn that Dr. Frankenstein is alive, and is reunited with his love, Elizabeth. As he recuperates, however, he receives an ominous visit from a past mentor, Dr. Pretorius. We discover that the doctor has come to plead with him to join in continuing the work that he now realizes was foolish and wrong. Dr. Pretorius convinces him to continue for the sake of science. As Dr. Pretorius gathers bodies, however, he has a chance encounter with the monster, who has been hiding from the town's people in the crypt where he is now scavenging. This meeting leads to the monster aligning himself with Pretorius in the goal of creating a companion for him.When Dr. Pretorius returns to the castle to collaborate with Frankenstein, he finds that he has had second thoughts, and orders the monster to take Elizabeth hostage until their work is complete. After many long hours of work, they succeed in creating a female companion for the Monster, and she is grandiosely announced as ""The Bride of Frankenstein."" The monster, who has begun to grow impatient with the doctor in creating his companion, confronts his bride expecting an immediate kinship, but is twice rejected by her. It is then that he decides he can no longer live. He allows Elizabeth and Dr. Frankenstein to flee as he throws a switch and brings the whole laboratory down on the heads of not only himself, but his bride, and the evil Dr. Pretorius.The story focuses primarily on, as was mentioned at the outset, the importance of companionship in our lives. The Monster, shunned by all whom he came across was in desperate need of kinship. In the kind old blind man, he first found it, and had it taken away. His chance meeting with Pretorius, however, promised to return it to him, and more. When he was rejected by his bride, he could no longer live. While it is not quite so dramatically demonstrated within, the theme of the film is somewhat mirrored in that of Forrest Gump. The main character spends the entire film in pursuit of one companion and suffers rejection several times before eventually winning Jenny, only to have her taken from him yet again.The use of both lighting and camera angles in the film play a pivotal role in establishing a connection with the main character of Frankenstein's Monster. Lighting of the face is often used to convey his mood, and dramatic swings in demeanor, as well as liberal use of close up shots to give the audience a good look at the expert conveyance of emotion without spoken word by the master himself, Boris Karloff.In the end, Frankenstein's monster was not united with his bride in new life, but in a second death. When he could no longer bear the thought of living in a world with no one but himself and the frightened screams of the town's people, he chose to end his own suffering, and vindicated himself, in some way, by taking the evil doctor, and his second creation with him. While his understanding that there was no greater gift than companionship was dramatically illustrated, the pain of rejection ultimately won the day and sent him to a horrific end.",The Bride of Frankenstein

(of course we know Hollywood takes it's artistic liberties and can simply ignore such things, but it is an interesting point to consider anyhow :-) The entire Frankenstein series is very interesting, they probably could have kept it going for more sequels, but Karloff was the best actor by far for portraying the part of the Frankenstein monster, he gave the monster a personality even in the original where he didn't talk yet.",The Bride of Frankenstein
260,malvernp-1,An outstanding classic!,10,9 August 2004,"This is a very special combination of humor, horror and pathos. It entertains, thrills and touches us in so many ways. The Monster in this film remains one of cinema's unique creations. Karloff has never been more effective and James Whale never more original and inventive. It is too bad that younger viewers are not more familiar with this film. It would surprise them with its subtleness and wit---as well as its sheer entertainment value. Definitely a 10 out of 10! The screenplay is a masterpiece of engaging dialog, effective pacing and clever situations. Is there a more remarkable scene in all of horror film than the visit of the Monster to the hermit in the woods?",The Bride of Frankenstein
261,GKE_65,The Genius Of James Whale,10,18 August 2019,"James Whale crafted this film, each frame has his stamp on it, from the casting of his actors--to their expressions. The sets, make-up, costumes, lighting--all of it, were his creations. Even the extras, were chosen with the same care as the primaries, and all of this results in how the film 'looks.' We are transported to Mary Shelly's England, to mansions, the countryside, villages, lakes, mountains and laboratories. From the depths to the heavens, we are wet and cold in Whale's storms, afraid of the fury Victor Frankenstein is once again about to unleash, we are confused by his rambling dull God/Monster. Where too, is his terrifying awareness of the overwhelming power he'd captured from the skies, outwardly tamed, and his to command. He's forgotten the fear of what it was, like humans may forget an unbearable pain, his memory of that terror torn from the heavens, harnessed--yet cognently alive, racing, crackling through the tower room, seeking to escape, is blunted, instead, in his every movement, we see Victor Frankenstein, manic, confident, 'god the father,' yet full of fragile human hubris--as he creates Eve. As Frankenstein leashes the power which transforms him and his monsters into gods, we may be disappointed as it's fury appears tamer, more malleable, diminished, but it is instead, cunning, containing anticipation, searing lust, and ravenous hunger to walk the earth. In our seats, we are not limited to a vision of players on a soundstage, as we watch Whale's third and truest monster emerge to find a home in resurected woman, the more dangerous intended mate to Whale's vision of Adam/Christ.
The ending, set by Shelly's story, was de-energized as he was true to her prim 'happy ending' which slaughtered the earlier promise of a more lucious dystopia, but we are brilliantly walked to the edge, by James Whale.",The Bride of Frankenstein
262,alexwilcock-1,The darkest and funniest of all black comedies,10,8 August 2005,"The greatest comedy about death ever made; perhaps the greatest film, too. James Whale's original Frankenstein is still outstanding over seven decades later, but this is his masterpiece. Direction, design, music and actors are all superb, the plot is sharp, the lines are quotable, and unlike most comedy horror movies, Bride of Frankenstein still manages both to disturb and to make you laugh, particularly in Ernest Thesiger's amoral Pretorius, a contender for the most toweringly camp performance you'll ever see (he's my only weakness).No wonder there's something to offend so many people, all the way from those who think it blasphemous to laugh about life and death to straight-faced horror buffs who think it doesn't take itself seriously enough. Yes, Shivers Magazine, using that stuffy excuse to omit it from your list of the greatest horror films, that means you. The film's target is precisely those who hold themselves too seriously to question anything, and who persecute anyone who makes them question themselves. Just look at the emotional heart to the picture, where the innocent, corrupted Monster is the only really sympathetic character.Much-imitated and borrowed from in everything from Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars  which understandably plunders possibly the greatest score in movie history  to The League of Gentlemen, whose two most famous characters appear to meet their end in a way that more than echoes the Monster here... And if Karloff's Monster is still the most recognisable of all make-ups, there must be hundreds of other places you've seen the Bride's zigzag electric hairdo on screen. It'll be a treat for you to see the original, too.",The Bride of Frankenstein
263,tbogard-46120,"It's a classic, and probably one of the best Horror movies.",10,14 July 2019,"I was indouced to this movie when I was 12, and from that moment on I keep watching it in delight. I first watched it on AMC, but since I bought the Unverisal Monster Collection for blu-ray I respect it more.
If you're new to the Unverisal Monsters, or want to watch a classic creepy movie at midnight watch this. From the moment when you see the airplane flying around earth (the old Unverisal logo), to the ending credits you would be entained. This is the best horror movie ever, and I recommen you give it a try.",The Bride of Frankenstein
264,russellsj,Male and Female Created He Them,10,21 January 2006,"The judgement as to whether or not a movie is good or bad must, in some ways, be rather subjective. True, there may be some technical areas where skill can accurately be judged; but ultimately, the effectiveness of a film as a means of entertainment should figure highly in its reputation.All of which is my rather pompous way to introduce the fact that ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is my favourite film of all time. I once read that the great critic Leslie Halliwell felt the same way. Thank God it's not just me, then.I do not know much about the art of cinema: the lighting; writing; casting; editing; and so on. But the fact remains, I have been watching films for forty years and ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" is still my favourite.Although it is said that director James Whale preferred e.g. ""Showboat"", most modern critics regard TBOF as his magnum opus. And what a work it was.The sets look fantastic, the cast are wonderfully chosen (apart, perhaps, from the screeching Una O'Connor), and the plot keeps the viewer interested.Karloff's portrayal of the monster has won universal acclaim ever since the film was released, and rightly so. Wiser people than me have waxed lyrical on this remarkable performance and I would refer you to them. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, produces an oddly stagey performance but one, when viewed against the background of the actor's problems with alcohol, seems exactly right. Frankenstein himself was, as we know, seriously off the rails, and Clive's performance rings true.But best of all is the greatest camp villain the silver screen has ever known: Doctor Septimus Pretorius. Veteran British character actor Ernest Thesiger (a friend of Whale's and brother to the celebrated explorer Wilfred Thesiger) camps it up to the hilt. He obviously relishes regaling us with lines such as, ""I created them from seed"", and, ""Life - like love - has her little surprises."" Watch the film and form your own opinion. Do not be afraid to laugh, but most of all enjoy a real masterpiece.",The Bride of Frankenstein
