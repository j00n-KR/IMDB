0,TheLittleSongbird,Has the same pros and cons as the first movie- in short unexceptional but watchable,6,31 March 2011,"I am not sure which of the two is better, so I am going to say that in my eyes this sequel is on the same level as its predecessor albeit with one improvement. Neither movie is as good as the timeless TV show or the wonderful Chipmunk Adventure, but in many ways more than one both are cute and harmless movies without trying to be 5-star masterpieces.Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel has cons that are similar to its predecessor. As with the first, the film is very predictable with some clichéd human characters and situations, though in fairness a lot of animated/live action films do have that problem as well. Also it does have some hits and misses in the script with some jokes that parents might groan at. The film is rather short and rushed as well.Faults aside, the film does have an improvement, the performance of Jason Lee as David. In the first he was miscast and out of his depth, here he is much more comfortable and relaxed. Visually and technically, I have little to fault it either. The photography and editing is crisp without being award-worthy, the location work is quite colourful and striking and the animation on the chipmunks again is spot on being very cute. The chipmunks are adorable with voices that are thankfully not irritating, and as with the first Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel nails the personalities of the chipmunks, Theodore again being the best realised. And the soundtrack is very catchy, with tuneful melodies and sweet lyrics, which kids will love and adults will possibly tolerate too.Overall, unexceptional but watchable family entertainment. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
1,bkoganbing,Please chipmunks don't be late,5,12 December 2016,"Those adorable singing chipmunks discovered by David Seville find they have some competition with a singing chipmunk trio known as the Chipettes who are girls. Kind of hard to keep your mind on school and performing with those chipmunk hormones kicking in.I did say school because Jason Lee as David has a broken leg and Simon, Theodore, and Alvin are in the charge of Seville's socially challenged nephew Zachary Levi. The boys have their usual problems of adjustments that humans do let alone rodents.In addition the Moriarty of the piece is their former manager David Cross is determined not to let the old chipmunk act steal the thunder of his new group.This second Alvin And The Chipmunks film, The Squeaksquel is funny in spots and adults might occasionally get a chuckle. But it really is strictly for little kids.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
2,SnoopyStyle,harmless Chipmunks for the kids,5,24 July 2016,"Dave (Jason Lee) is in the hospital after the Chipmunks cause an accident at their Paris concert. Aunt Jackie is supposed to be the next caretaker but the boys quickly send her to the hospital. Then it's up to Jackie's incompetent video game obsessed grandson Toby (Zachary Levi). The boys have to go to high school. Dr. Rub (Wendie Malick) is the principal. All the girls love the Chipmunks and the boys hate them for it. Ian Hawke (David Cross) is living in the record company basement vowing revenge and living off of garbage. Then the Chipettes, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, show up looking for representation.I don't know if Jason Lee had better things to do. Sending the Chipmunks to high school has some potential. Adding the Chipettes should double the fun. The execution does not pan out exactly. It's bearable for adults and Chipmunk wacky for the kids. It has a High School Musical feel but not as good. There are probably a couple of familiar faces in the teenagers' crowd. This is harmless and safe for the kids.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
3,kosmasp,More of the same ... and the others,4,24 March 2012,"You know this still works for the little ones, but will appall a lot older viewers, than say the first one did. It's basically more of the same, even with the addition of some Chipmunks ""rivals"" (another group of talking ...). The little ones won't mind (I watched it with my nephew and he enjoyed it), but what about the parents? There are other movies that can please both.Still not really that bad, you can watch this in its own right or at least put the kids there and let them enjoy it. It's like the Chipmunks won't grow up (literally and physically that is), but again it's only us grown-ups that will think about things like that.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
4,jboothmillard,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4,11 December 2010,"The first film, based on the musical band and the children's cartoon was tedious and annoying, this sequel I was hoping would be better, as the critics thought it was, from director Betty Thomas (Private Parts, Doctor Dolittle, John Tucker Must Die). Basically after brother pop stars, the Chipmunks, Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney), put their carer Dave Seville (Jason Lee) in the hospital, they need someone else to look after them. It appears that their Aunt Jackie (Kathryn Joosten) is the person who is going to do that, but she ends up in hospital too, and twenty-something games nerd, Dave's nephew Toby (Zachary Levi) is the only one left. Arrangements are made for the Chipmunks to put aside their stardom and go to school, tasked by super fan principal to help save the music program with the upcoming battle of the bands competition with a funding prize of $25,000. Meanwhile, the Chipmunks old meanie Ian Hawke (David Cross) is living in the basement of JETT records on scraps from dumpsters having lost his reputation, but his luck changes when he finds three female chipmunks, the Miller sisters Brittany (Christina Applegate), Eleanor (Amy Poehler) and Jeanette (Anna Faris). The Chipettes as they call themselves turned up in a parcel to find Ian, and after proving themselves to be good singers, he hires them and with some lies to convince them he still has a career, he starts scheming his way back into business. The Chipmunks are having a hard time getting on in school with bullies and jocks bringing them down, but they are perked up when the Chipettes turn up to put themselves forward to represent the school. The principal decides the only way to settle which of the two furry bands should represent the school in the competition is to have a sing off contest, and the winner will do it. Alvin is neglecting his brothers, trying to fit in with the guys who were originally picking on him, and Ian is forcing the Chipettes to change the way they are, by having Brittany as the lead singer and the other two just back up. The Chipettes know that Ian is nasty when he locks them in a cage, and Alvin goes to rescue them just before the singing competition, and they arrive just in time for both the Chipmunks and Chipettes to perform. In the end, all the apologies are made, Ian loses his career again, Dave, out of hospital watches the six furry friends perform, and allows the three newbies to stay with them. Also starring Kevin G. Schmidt as Ryan, Chris Warren Jr. as Xander and Bridgit Mendler as Becca. The choice of songs with the helium voices, including ""You Really Got Me"", ""You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)"", ""Put Your Records On"", ""Hot N Cold"", ""Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)"" and ""We Are Family"" are certainly more fun to hear. The squeaky voices are still a little annoying, the live actors are cheesy, and the story is patchy and could have used a little work, but I suppose it is a tiny bit better than the predecessor, an alright part-animated comedy adventure. Okay!",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
5,BA_Harrison,Lighten up folks—it's just a kids' film about singing chipmunks!,6,9 April 2011,"The first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie took the tried and tested rock 'n' roll fable route, charting its talented rodents' rise to fame, their big break, the bitter struggle with the many temptations of stardom, and their inevitable exploitation by unscrupulous business types. Elation, heartache, excitement, despair, fear, joy: it was all there, along with gags about poo.The plot for The Squeakquel—a formulaic high-school based morality tale about the importance of loyalty—isn't quite as strong and the film definitely lacks the freshness of the original, but there is still enough good stuff here to warrant a watch, especially if you're already a fan of the furry trio.Betty Thomas does a decent enough job in the director's chair, delivering plenty of not too sophisticated laughs and lots of energetic musical numbers, the effects are on par with the original, and the cast all put in more than adequate performances (David Cross as evil Ian providing my favourite gag right at the end of the film). On top of all that, Alvin, Theodore and Simon are joined by the slick high-pitched harmonies of the Chipettes, an equally talented trio of female chipmunks—bookish Jeanette, big-boned Eleanor, and sexy Brittany (errr... did I say sexy? I meant cute. Time to go now, I think!).",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
6,michaelRokeefe,Come on and shake what your mama gave ya!,3,3 April 2010,"Gosh, enough is enough. Those lovable singing chipmunks featuring Alvin(Justin Long)try and put their musical career on hold to extend their book learning. They return to school to find the music program is having money problems and put the school's hope in a battle of the bands competition. Alvin, Theodore and Simon seem to have it in the bag so to speak; but they are going to meet their match in the Chippettes(voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler and Anna Faris). Compromises will have to be made to keep everyone happy. Manager Dave(Jason Lee)has less screen time in this ""squeakquel"". Other players: David Cross, Wendie Malick and Zachary Levi. I really can't see why; but you know good and well that there has to be a third outing in the planning. Money is money; and there is definitely an audience.

7,view_and_review,The Weakquel,3,18 November 2021,"I was never a fan of the Chipettes even when they were on the cartoon back in the 80's. They are such an unoriginal creation. They are quite literally the female version of the Chipmunks. Where's the thought in that?""The Squeakquel"" ushered in the Chipettes and a way for Ian (David Cross), the now demoralized and homeless music exec, to get back into the limelight. When Dave (Jason Lee) was hospitalized due to Alvin's recklessness--Again!--the Chipmunks had to stay with Dave's Aunt Jackie (Kathryn Joosten). That plan never took effect because she was hospitalized as well, so her grandson Toby (Zachary Levi) ended up watching the Chipmunks at Dave's home.Another new development was Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) being enrolled in school because that's exactly where little talking rodents should be; in a high school with people. The Chipmunks were requested to enter a music contest on behalf of the school to raise $25,000 for the school's music department. That seemed like an odd request to me. I'm thinking the principal would ask a mega-famous singing group to simply donate $25,000 to their new high school. But that's just me.On to the Chipettes. Their intrusion was as contrived as their very existence. They made their way to Hollywood where they wanted to meet the Chipmunks and launch their own singing career (I did say they were a female carbon copy of the Chipmunks right?). They were swooped up by Ian (David Cross) who hadn't learned his lesson from mistreating the Chipmunks and was going to ride his new trio back to the top.The Chipettes were probably the worst part of this movie. Besides being a knock off of Alvin and the Chipmunks, they were a sassy, gyrating, female group singing about ""all the single women"" in a kids movie. Was that really the best song you could think of for them to perform?I don't want to put this movie's failure all upon the shoulders of the Chipettes because there was plenty of lousiness to spread around to everyone. It wasn't like the first movie was a masterpiece, but this movie was the pits.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
8,anaconda-40658,Chipmunk Dung.,2,15 March 2016,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel (2009): Dir: Betty Thomas / Cast: Jason Lee, David Cross, Zachary Levi, Wendie Malick, Anjelah Johnson: One could say that the budget went to the guy who came up with the subtitle. As lame as it is, it certainly surpasses anything the screenplay possessed. After Dave has an accident, the three singing chipmunks are sent to live with an aunt and go to school. Then she has an accident due too Dave's idiotic nephew. After a bout with bullies they are set to help the school win a talent contest. Directed by Betty Thomas with Alvin, Simon and Theodore looking fantastic but the story is lame. Thomas has directed a broad range of films from the excellent Howard Stern bio-comedy Private Parts to the Sandra Bullock rehab 28 Days. This is hardly one of her superior projects. Jason Lee as Dave spends the whole film laid up, which is probably for the better seeing that he is second to CGI chipmunks. David Cross plays an idiotic villain out to exploit a female chipmunk band. He must endure the embarrassment of dressing up as a female chipmunk that looks straight out of Donnie Darko's worst nightmares. Zachary Levi plays Dave's lazy nephew who sleeps and plays video games. One supposes that anything is better than being part of this film. Terrible family entertainment that should squeak underneath one's tires as the car backs out of the driveway. Score: 2 / 10",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
9,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squekquel,2,25 December 2009,"I will not deny that I've grown up with the Alvin and the Chipmunks cartoon series on television, and had unabashedly enjoyed their very first cinematic outing way back in the year 2007, formulaic the storyline may be like an extended cartoon episode. That it had raked in enough cash meant a sequel wouldn't be far away, and the logical progression in terms of the introduction of new characters, translated to the ushering of The Chipettes, voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler and Anna Faris as Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette respectively.But the sequel suffered from having a rather half baked plot in trying to pit one set of chipmunks over the other, and complicated itself by trying to do too much in too little, having to write off their human guardian Dave (Jason Lee) to replace him with nephew Toby (Zachary Levi) who's about as plain as a piece of cardboard, and the very tired Alvin versus his brothers in an all for one and one for none subplot involving his association with the football jocks in search for a higher popularity.Even the villain too was a repeat in having Ian (David Cross) make a comeback, in trying to exploit the Chipettes for his comeback after falling from grace in the first film, without the clunky corporate executive being corrupted by greed and money stemming from good intentions. Here he's manipulative in a child-like fashion through and through, and you can see his grand plot from a mile away when he tries to isolate one of the Chipettes whom he thinks will be a better solo artist at the expense of the rest. So it's a revisit of the same old themes of family togetherness over friends, or over careers, which got repeated twice for the different triplets. And it's either me, or somehow having the chipmunks all sounding alike (despite having a different voice cast) got to me this time round. The redeeming grace of having them sing and dance to contemporary pop tunes also took a nose dive here, having the number of performances got reduced, and of course the novelty of having such songs ""munked"" have lost their lustre.However, having it released during this festive period would mean that all will get forgiven, and children will once again be thrilled by the all singing, all dancing chipmunks welcoming the festive cheer. There's a coda at the end of the film as well, so don't just head out the cinema once the credits start to roll.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Pretty harmless, it's like a high school jock picking on a chipmunk... wait a minute",5,6 December 2010,"I guess America will never be sick of the Chipmunks, though who am I kidding? I always watched the cartoon when I was a kid. Of course I saw the movie a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a bad film. I was worried about the CGI and thought it would be cheesy, but it wasn't all that bad. There were even some great catchy songs that you found yourself singing too as well. So the now we have the sequel, this is where I was starting to wonder if this was more meant for money. We have some pretty well known actors playing the chipmunks and the chipettes, which I thought was a bit silly since their voices are put through a synthesizer anyways, so what's the point of having a big name when you already have Jason Lee? This played just like a typical chipmunk episode and I wasn't that impressed with it. Not as bad as you'd think, but still this movie needed some major work, even if it is meant for the kids, which we know this was more for the fans.During the Chipmunks' benefit concert David is injured. Dave must recuperate and is forced to leave his aunt to look after the Chipmunks. Arrangements are also made for them to go to school. After another accident, the Chipmunks are left in the care of Toby. Meanwhile, Ian Hawke lives in the basement of JETT Records. Three singing female chipmunks, also known as the Chipettes, emerge and Ian hires them as plot to get back at the Chipmunks and revive his career. While at school, the Chipmunks are bullied by jocks and visit the principal's office. They discover that the principal is a huge fan and wants them to help raise money for the music program by participating in a contest. Meanwhile, when Ian receives his daily newspaper, he is shocked to find the Chipmunks on the front page. After he reads the story, he quickly sends the Chipettes to school. The Chipmunks and the Chipettes will compete against each other in the Battle of the Bands contest.So while the movie doesn't fall flat on it's face, it definitely was not needed. There are moments where I thought it was a little too silly and predictable, not to mention I'm confused how a high school girl finds a chipmunk to be hot? The jocks pick on the chipmunks which I thought was silly, I mean, really? Let's be serious, let's say that this is a real life situation and talking and singing chipmunks really exist, how could you possibly feel tough by picking on a chipmunk? But I do have to admit that the meeting between the chipmunks and the chipettes was pretty cute. The chipette's rendition of Single Ladies was pretty catchy. I had a couple of laughs with Ian trying to cover the concert when the girls back out. Like I said I think this was more meant for the kids than the adults and also of course more for the money, but I guess it's pretty harmless fun. Hard to hate this movie when the leading characters are singing chipmunks, they were awesome in the 80's and they're still pretty cool to this day. However I would recommend this movie more for the kids vs. the adults, at least the adults still have the cartoon with ""Alvin, Simon, Theodore! Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo, Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo!"". Well, you get the idea.5/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
11,lesleyharris30,"Not as good as the first one but still a lot of fun,",6,5 September 2010,"Alvin And The Chimpmunks 2:The Squeakquel is a good movie with enjoyable and funny stuff but I found it to be a disappointment compared to the original Alvin And The Chimpmunks,I don't think the storyline is as good and you don't see too much of Dave.When Dave is put into hospital, his cousin or brother (they don't tell you) has to take care of them and Dave tells him to put Alvin,Simon and Teador into school,were they deal with a lot of bully's and Ian returns to try make them lose their fame by three singing girl chipmunks,the Chipettes!-DILLON HARRIS",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
12,inkblot11,"Seek out the Squeakquel, do, all who desire a fun family flick",8,29 December 2009,"The darling chipmunks are back and continue their careers as rock singers! While performing on stage, however, Alvin accidentally causes his ""dad"", David Seville (Jason Lee) to have a major accident. Soon Dave is in traction at the local hospital and has called his aunt to care for A, Simon, and Theodore. But, she, too, has a pratfall at the airport and so her grandson, Toby (Zachary Levi), ends up watching the singing rodents. Toby, however, is very young and although he tries hard, keeping up with the chipmunks is difficult. For starters, the chipmunks now attend the local high school, where the girls are gaga for them and the boys are miffed that they aren't getting as much attention. Most importantly, the school's music department needs money so the principal (Wendie Malick) has signed the performing chipmunks up for a ""battle of the high school bands"". Meanwhile, former manager Ian (David Cross) is near-homeless and living next to the music studio where he was once employed. One day, three little GAL chipmunks (voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler, and Anna Faris) arrive especially to see him, for they can sing and they are hoping to be his new act. Ho, ho, perhaps this is the way for Ian to get back to the top of the biz. Learning about the band battle, he enrolls the female chipmunks at the same high school and insists on that they join the musical competition. What will be the result? This is another winner in the family flick category. The chipmunks are darling and, what a nice turn, we now have the Chipettes, too, those lovable female chipmunks. All of the actors voicing the cute critters do a very nice job. Lee, unfortunately, has very little screen time but Cross, Malick, and all of the others do a fine job. The story, musical numbers, and direction are all great while the wonderful animation is a huge asset, for the chipmunks really are something special to behold. One minor criticism, however, is that the high school students practice ""swirlies"", that is, dunking kids and chipmunks, headfirst, into the toilet. This cruel practice could have been left out. But, all in all, do seek out the Squeakquel, it is fun, fun, and more fun.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
13,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,3,1 April 2010,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The SqueakquelUsually, when you place three wild rodents in a recording studio surrounded by expensive equipment and press record, all you get is the sound of them chewing through the microphone cord, followed by a crackle of electricity, and three death rattles. However, in this furry family film, when you put a trio of tree dwellers in a studio, you get a bunch of high-pitched cover songs.With Dave (Jason Lee) in hospital after a chipmunk related accident, the boys, Alvin, Simone and Theodore (Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney), are entrusted to his nephew, Toby (Zachary Levi). Required to attend high school, the Chipmunks make a big splash on campus when they're asked to save the school's music program. But before the boys can collect the prize money, they must best an all-female chipmunk group (Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate).A perfunctory sequel to the 2007 original, The Squeakquel maintains the same low expectations as its predecessor: the story is sorry, the songs are boring, and the star- studded vocal cast is superfluous.Besides, the only time you're libel to find chipmunks inside of a high school is when the cafeteria is serving mystery meat for lunch.

14,ironhorse_iv,"Should be renamed, Alvin & yip schmucks! This movie was awful.",3,25 September 2014,"In 1958, struggling songwriter Ross Bagdasarian found himself a hit by increasing the speed of the recording, making his voice sound funny. With this, he create three cartoon characters to fit the high pitch: Alvin, Simon and Theodore, The Chipmunks. They were a big hit in the '50s, and once again, a big hit in the 1980s with a TV cartoon series. In 2007, the series once again got remade. This time live-action with some CGI effects. Although the first movie did re-spark an interest in the Chipmunks franchise, many fans weren't exactly impressed with the movie and its 2009 & 2011 sequels. As much as I hate the 2007 remake of 'Alvin and Chipmunks', this Squeakquel was downright insufferable. In the movie, Alvin (Voiced by Justin Long) is downright more sociopathic in his behavior, while Simon (Voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler) is a dumb down and Theodore (Voiced by Jesse McCartney) is just a stupid punchline to be abused and made fun of. The first movie has a story/moral in which the three chipmunks realize that fame and fortune is not all it is cracked out to be, and leave the seemingly superficial lifestyle, and the money, behind to enjoy an apparently better down-to-earth life. Yet, it's forgotten here, because the movie starts off, how very self-centered, they became. The whole plot feels rushed because there are so many plot elements to throw into the mix here that it never falls into a cohesive storyline. It's a plot that make little to no sense, as the Chipmunks are forced to go to school. I understand, the writers were trying to adapt the old cartoon, but the thing you have to remember is that in the cartoon, the anthropomorphic chipmunks there, were as tall as most human children their age and look more human that its couther parts here. That allowed the show to get away with having singing anthropomorphic chipmunks live like normal children. Here they are regular sized chipmunks so that same idea simply doesn't work. If they were to go to school, wouldn't it be for anthropomorphic animals. Another thing, if they were allow to join a human school; I really doubt their age in chipmunks years match that of a human high school student. Wouldn't they be in middle school? Another thing about the weak plot, is the premise of saving the school music program. The whole music program is barely establish and we never get the why it will be shut down, unless the school wins a music competition. We, the audience, never know why it's important to the school. It's not like the Chipmunks are helping or training any of the students in the music program to win the competition. When you think about it, there isn't any music students established at all. Who knows, if there were a music program in the first place, before the Chipmunks arrived. Added to this stupid premise is the presence of the previous film villain, Ian Hawke (David Cross) whom plans to use a female version of the Chipmucks to steal the Chipmunks' fame by entering the singing group into the same school music competition. The Chipettes made out of Eleanor (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Jeanette (Voiced by Anna Faris), and Brittany (Voiced by Christina Applegate) really come out of nowhere in the film, and serve nothing, but love interested. They are so hit by the pitch shifting you can't even tell them apart. I don't even, know why they couldn't use voice actors for them. In the cartoon series, they are supposed to rivals to the Chipmunks, but you never see them go one on one, here. The Chippettes in real life were created for the sole purpose of allowing Ross Bagdasarian to make covers of popular girls' songs in addition to the guys' songs covered by the Chipmunks. So the Chippettes are, in essence, the Chipmunks with girl parts. Very hollow characters. There barely any good female leads here. Despite being Dave's love interest, and a key character in the first film, Claire is nowhere to be found here. This is mainly because Cameron Richardson refused to reprise the role, as she strongly disliked being in the first film. The supporting characters that did show up in the film are just awful. Jason Lee is barely in the film as Dave Seville. Zachary Levi as Toby was awful as a Dave's replacement. His sub-plot romantic with the teacher was just not needed, and doesn't help move the plot. Everything about his performance was underwhelming. You really don't get to see the great conflict that Alvin has with Dave in Toby. It was one of the things that made the series stand out! The jokes are mostly misses than hits. The obligatory fart joke, the embarrassingly inaccurate racial stereotypes, and slapstick humor were all badly delivered. Even the cultural pop references don't even make much sense, because the film references a lots of nearly unknown shows that children probably don't watch, like Meerkat Manor or NASCAR on FOX, with the cameo Digger the NASCAR gopher. The film is disturbing, as it already portray pedophilia and bestiality like themes with human beings lusting for naked under aged chipmunks. Add, references to 1991's Silent of the Lambs and 1976's Taxi Driver, and you got a movie that makes you wonder if this movie is truly a kid movie. Depending who you are, the pop songs used in the film could seem brutally murder or watered down. It didn't bug me, too much. The 3D gimmick kinda did its job, but the whole CG & the unrealistic speed it's moving at, makes it hard to watch in 3D at times. Overall: It's nearly unwatchable, even for kids. Instead of watching this movie, go back and re-watched the 1980s cartoons. You'll get more fun out of that, than this.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
15,leplatypus,Those chipmunks get nuts (Screen),4,22 February 2010,"This was again the choice of the kid. A bit like the Russian roulette. So we ran in the cold to see a sequel about characters that I even didn't watch in their dull cartoons in my childhood.However, after the movie, we were happy. Those chipmunks have a lot of energy and they know how to put a mess! So, it's funny. Their voices are great even thought I couldn't escape a snooze after the school contest! For me, it was remembrances from ""Roger Rabbit"" but the movie is too cheap for a classic.

17,lisafordeay,Can a 22 yr old enjoy this flick actually YES they can,5,12 May 2013,"I saw this a couple of times before and the main reason why I watch it is because of one man Zachary Levi. I saw Zac in the 2010 animated hit Tangled and thought that he was actually a really funny guy. Here he plays Toby Seville who is the nephew of Dave Seville and he has to look after the chipmunks Alvin voiced by Justin Long, Theodore voiced by Jessie McCartney and Simon voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler while their owner Dave played by Jason Lee is in hospital as Alvin was messing on stage and accidentally knocked him out with a big cardboard of himself. So meanwhile we are also introduced to 3 new chipmunks called The Chipettes and their new owner played by David Cross from Megamind who was the voice of the minion in that film. He of course uses them as revenge on Alvin and his brothers as they ditched him from the first movie.SO Alvin and his brothers also have to go to school and they later meet up with the Chipettes.The film is slightly irritating but if your looking for a good laugh or if you are a fan of Zachary Levi then check it out.

18,FiendishDramaturgy,Rather Disappointing,4,8 March 2010,"The predecessor for this film was adorable. This one is rather annoying. Children chipmunks finding their way through life is bad enough, but to have them in pubescent form, attempting some chipmunk version of Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human just doesn't make for ""cute"" anymore. This was just fair.After the joy we found in the first attempt, I expected much more from this one. But the joy was not there to be found. What was there was angst, bad decisions, stupidity, ego massaging, puffery, and deceit. This isn't a lesson for most kids, and by the time they get around to showing what a bad idea this all was, it's too little too late. The lesson is lost in the glitz and glamor of the life of the pop star culture.No wonder pop stars all go bad, if this is the kind of stuff they have to deal with 24/7.Further, the attire of the girl chipmunks is completely inappropriate, and the behaviors herein are NOTHING to be imitated by America's youth! Miley Cyrus' clothing line is bad enough! Enough is enough, people!I didn't like it.It rates a 3.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

The colors are soothing, and the comedy is mild.The script provided nice time. I loved smartly written moments like how the nerd boy, played by Levi, had to supersede the chipmunks at the party with his singing, so his old flame got the chance to hear his feelings for her rightly. Plus smartly made moments, like the mission of rescuing the she chipmunks with a motorcycle chase.So, eventually, what on earth the haters was yakking about??!!You know what are the real problems of this movie? I'll tell. Not having Jason Lee as the co-lead; which was done for never-understood reason. One fart joke I hated. And the fact of the movie as short.However, it does satisfy me the way it is, and clearly for the aforementioned reasons. Therefore, some reviewers made me angry with remarks like: ""Terrible Movie"". Well, I think the approach, that these reviewers use to evaluate such a movie, is the real ""Terrible""!This is light fun, as non fat cake. It worked / works / will work for me. Who can't feel joy in heart by the chipmunks singing Beyoncé Knowles's Single Ladies?!",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
20,meeza,Alvinator Salvation! MM! I don't think so!,7,4 January 2010,"The high pitches are back! No not of Pitchers playing in small-market Major League Baseball teams. I am referring to those of the all-star zillionaires Alvin and The Chipmunks. The first ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" film, which was released a couple of years ago, was a smash box-office hit. So there is no need to squeak that a sequel was not coming because that was not going to happen. So here we have ""Alvin and The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"". Alvin, Theodore, and Simon are back at it in creating havoc on their caretaker with their shenanigans; this time the caretaker is Toby played by Zachary Levi. Jason Lee does return in a smaller cameo role as Dave, the Chipmunks caretaker of the original. In this go-around, The Chipmunks go to school and discover the realities of campus life. Because having singing chipmunks in a high school is such a reality, right. Alvin has just slapped my face! Alviiiiiiiiiiiin!!!!!! Ian, the villainous record producer from the original, returns once more; this time around he is homeless, unemployed, and out-of-his-luck until he discovers some chipmettes (yes, female chipmunks) of the old block who also possess singing talent as the chipmunks. Ian uses the ""little ladies"" to seek revenge on the Chipmunks and then Do I really have to elaborate more on the plot of a singing chipmunks movie? This sequel does have some pop culture originality as its predecessor, but it does run its course after the first 30 minutes of the film. There were a few guilty-pleasure laughs at sporadic times as I also got in the first one; but not too many! However, you have to take it with a grain of salt (not referring to the Chipmunks literally) on this type of genre. It is what it is! Director Betty Thomas could not have done more with this material. Even though I would of have liked to see more of the idealistic Dave and less of the moronic slacker Toby. ""Alvin and The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" I guess is squeaky clean for kids to enjoy but not recommended for adults who constantly squeak through children movies. *** Average",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

Hey, you try to be a chipmunk in high school! I loved the principal in this movie, and the ""battle of the bands"" scenes were great and funny. I also like the ""chippettes."" They were great.

22,MissSimonetta,Just because it's for kids doesn't mean it has to be brainless and cheap,2,12 September 2011,"I was about as excited about watching The Squeakquel as Marie Antoinette was about walking to the guillotine. From the trailer alone, you can tell this was made with the hope of making a quick buck with as little quality as possible. It succeeded, as it made millions of quick bucks at the box office and it just made another when my mother decided to buy the DVD. We decided to spend quality time together watching this thing, and after wasting precious minutes of my life with bad jokes and a stale plot, I have decided to review it.The chipmunk trio is sent to high school, where they deal with stereotypical high school problems and have a rivalry with a female group of chipmunks, The Chipettes. The Chipette's manager is the greedy manager of the Chipmunks from the last movie, seeking to reclaim his former glory by making millions off of the female group's talent. Then, there's a plot where the Chipmunks sign up for a talent show in order to win money for the school's music program, which is losing funding, a plot I'm sure has never before been used.The story is about as interesting as the synopsis. You could make a drinking game based off of how often you can predict what's going to happen next. None of the characters besides the main trio are interesting, the jokes fall flat, and all the high school ""trauma"" the chipmunks deal with is about as real as an episode of Saved By the Bell.Now, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or some grade A masterpiece with complex themes and characters. I knew perfectly well this is a kids film and not one of excellent quality at that. It fails nonetheless. Just because a movie is for kids doesn't mean you have to reach for the lowest common denominator in order to entertain them, it doesn't mean you have to give them a thin plot with the freshness of a rotten apple core, it doesn't mean you have to reach for teenage stereotypes that should have been out with big hair, and it doesn't mean you shouldn't at least TRY to put a decent amount of effort into the final product! 3/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

If you ask me, the music was absolutely fantastic. It's hard for me to decide what the best songs of all were here. I really liked ""You Really Got Me,"" ""You Spin Me 'Round (Like A Record),"" and ""Stayin' Alive"" a lot. I hated Ian (David Cross), though. The reason for this is that because he was pure evil! However, all of the mischief that occurred was funny. The romance and competition was nice, too. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved did a good job. Now, in conclusion, if you haven't seen this excellent sequel to a nostalgic piece of cinema that will entertain everyone even if the haven't seen the TV shows, go rent it or buy it today. I guarantee you that you'll be thoroughly entertained.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
24,3xHCCH,Only bearable because of the Chippettes...,3,17 January 2010,"With this ""squeakuel"", I think this incarnation of Alvin and the Chipmunks has run its course. This Part 2 was really lame. Even my three kids with me did not react too much to the supposedly ""funny"" scenes. I was positively bored silly for most of the movie. Alvin's naughtiness is very nasty here in this movie, and unfunny for me.The only time my attention perked up was that first song number by the Chippettes. Their harmonized version of ""Put Your Records On"" was very cute. Their take on ""Single Ladies"" is also quite fine. In contrast, all the songs by the Chipmunks sounded very old and dated. The Chippettes are the only positive aspect of this movie. The special cameo of young Filipina singer Charice singing Alicia Keys' ""No One"" merits an additional star.After the movie, my kids only remembered a scene about underwear wedgies, and a part where a grown man wears a dress while doing hand puppets. I only remember laughing once, and that was a scene with Wendie Malick (Nina Van Horn of TV's ""Just Shoot Me"") as the school principal jumping up and down with glee (yeah, stupid scene, hehe). If you think those memorable scenes sound bad, you can imagine what more the rest of this film!",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
25,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel (2009),3,13 December 2011,"A bit of stupid repetitive fun. We are introduced to the Chippettes and the entire story is pretty much the same. We find The Chipmunks now at school, and due to some embarrassment it seems as though Jason Lee found a loophole in his contract to be mostly absent. Considering the chipmunks became superstars at the end of the first film, it was strange to see them settling in at a school and auditioning for a school competition. It also gave a good message about sometimes helping others. Alvin is an annoying prick for most of it, but Theodore is just insanely cute. David Cross puts in the exact same performance as last time. Although it is harmless family fun, the stupidly dated movie references and same story mean that the only reason to see this is if you are a huge Chippettes fan.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

It's a great movie for kids. Note: I was about 10 years old when this came out so yeah I enjoyed it as a kid.The movie is more funnier than the last one but it does have a dark moment in.

28,Howlin Wolf,Tainted by fame; A Cautionary Tail.,3,13 January 2011,"See; even I can do puns!I know they're singing chipmunks, but they really overplayed the musical angle this time, for me. I was hugely surprised by the original and really enjoyed it, despite being a 29 year old man, but this one is just a pale imitation.I don't know whether it was Jason Lee's decision not to be involved as much the second time around, but the fact that the story has ""Dave"" on the periphery of things really hurts the film, overall.I like the whole brothers/family dynamic... Nobody is endearing when they get entangled with the trappings of fame - not even chipmunks.It seems like whenever a writing team runs out of ideas, the easiest thing to do is go bigger. Then unfortunately, the sense of brotherhood and camaraderie gets lost.Don't make fun of me for talking about 'brotherhood' and 'camaraderie' in relation to chipmunks! You can blame my over-inflated expectations on the high standards set by the first film; standards which were not met, when it came to this 'squeakuel'.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
29,Troy_Campbell,"Predictable, terribly acted and lacking in substance.",4,31 December 2009,"OK, so I was one of those people who actually enjoyed the first Alvin. I know it was predictable, terribly acted and lacking in substance, but I liked it nonetheless. The Squeakquel not so much. There's no effort to even mask the predictability in this one, the filmmakers just concede to the fact there are no surprises. The acting is noticeably worse, Jason Lee essentially being replaced by the far less appealing Zachary Levi is the main contributor to this problem. And worst of all the shallowness of the plot can't be redeemed by numerous hit songs getting 'munked', like achieved by its predecessor.The major upside to the movie is still the song and dance numbers, which are turned up to eleven thanks to the arrival of The Chipettes. Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor (voiced by Applegate, Faris and Poehler respectively) provide two things: firstly, a reason for more girls to watch, secondly, and most importantly, the chance for the film to include female tunes. Its these 'cute girl' routines which provide the bulk of the enjoyment as Alvin, Simon and Theodore's music acts become tired very fast.Of particular annoyance to me is something that has become increasingly popular in Hollywood: big names being vocally unrecognisable. It occurred in the first Alvin and then again most recently in Planet 51. Why oh why would you use well-known actors if you can't tell it's them? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having them at all? Any old person can have their voice synthesised digitally to sound like a chipmunk, is it purely so their names can be included on the poster and in the trailer? Well, it is a real shame, because if I lured in talent like Long, Poehler and Faris I would make more out of it than name-dropping.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
30,bellino-angelo2014,Manages to be even worst than the predecessor,1,2 September 2018,"Yes, this movie was painful to watch, more than the first one. Especially since they replaced Jason Lee with Zachary Levy, who is more obnoxious and unfunny than Carrot Top after smoking weed (no pun intended). And there is also the stupid addition of the ''Chipettes'', who manage to be unbearable to hear to the point you want to shoot in your ears for end your suffering. And they are supposed to be adorable? NO WAY IN HELL NO!!! If Jason Lee needs money, he should return to ''My Name is Earl'', and maybe would return to fame!So, if you loved BABY GENIUSES, you'll love this movie. If you loved SON OF THE MASK you'll love this movie. If you loved ED you'll love this movie.

But the sounds of laughing children were about as rare as a steak.In other words, even the kids didn't like the movie.So what goes on? The chipmunks hurt their owner while performing some van halen (rock on) in high pitched tones. so then they have to stay with their grandmother (who also gets hurt) so then they have to stay with toby, who's only care is video gaming. To curb their time, the chipmunks have to go to school. they find their place in school with the singing competition. if they fail, the school's music classes and club will no longer exist.Meanwhile, the arsehole Ian wants vengeance. He finds it in the form of 3 girl chipmunks, called the chipettes. but the chipettes are perfect matches for the chipmunks. this is shown when they meet, along to the song ""I wanna know what love is"" (rock on).The only memorable funny part at which i really didn't have to try to laugh at was when one of the chipmunks broke the TV with the Wii remote. That has become an internet sensation, when some idiot kid doesn't put on the remote strap and throws the remote into the TV.If you hadn't guessed already, the soundtrack is the only good thing about the movie. but anyone can make a good soundtrack.I recommend that you don't watch this movie....at all.

Jason Lee, Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney return as Dave, Alvin, Simon and Theodore respectively and with the addition of Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Amy Phoeler making the voices of Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor. Maybe the best of this movie is its soundtrack, with really good songs like You really got me from Van Halen and Single Ladies from Beyonce.

The Chipmunks aren't charming just annoying, but on the other hand we have the Chipettes. I like these characters. They are not there to say bad jokes. They are there to sing and that is by far the best thing about the movie. I couldn't help but tap my feet a little bit.

I think all things that they want to show us, it has already appeared in the first movie. So thiz ""Squeakquel"" is only a repetition of what we have seen before. The movie is still played by Jason Lee and David Cross. The Alvin Character is voiced by Justin Long. The former Director Tim Hill who also directed ""Garfield"" (2004) now is replaced by Betty Thomas. It's very obvious that the moviemaker's intention is to refresh things up by the appearance of new characters, the Chippetes (the girl's version of the Chipmunks). Members of the Chippetes are Brittany (Christina Applegate), Jeanette (Anna Faris), Eleanor (Amy Poehler). We certainly recognize the trio as creditable Comediennes. I think in some ways, the movie is less musical than the first one. It looks like the Chippetes performance is based on the nowadays hip hop's style. If we look at the human characters, Zachary Levi seems to have more proportion than Jason Lee, both of them don't make us stunned by their performances. Their roles can be replaced easily by other Actors. In the end, I have to say that thiz kind of movie is definitely just for fun.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
38,dudedazzreviews,Just like the first movie but worse!,3,6 October 2010,"Okay, we're all going to have to admit this at some point, Alvin and the Chipmunks was an okay movie but does the sequel (or squeakquel) match up to the first? Do most sequels ever? The story was below mediocre and basically goes over old ground with a couple of things added to it, one being the Chipettes which is basically a female version of Alvin and the Chipmunks. The acting was below average, I remember it being much better in the first movie and the characters can be annoying at times but there were a couple of scenes when they were funny. The one person who extremely annoyed me constantly was the villain of the movie, all I wanted to do was put a sock in his mouth to shut him up. The animation was done very well and the way they mixed live-action with CGI was done great.There were a couple of funny moments in the movie but other than that, it felt like it was trying too hard. This will definitely entertain children but adults may find this an irritating bore in some parts. It depends on if you liked the Alvin and the Chipmunk cartoons. I used to love watching the cartoons when I was a kid and when the first movie was released, I watched and enjoyed it but watching the second one, I felt that the sequel was pointless. It's been done before but this time, there's the Chipettes. They didn't really add much to the movie in my opinion, it was just a basic repeat of the first movie with females (they're looking for stardom, finds manager, blah blah blah). There were one or two funny scenes but other than that, instantly forgettable as soon as the movie ends.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

Since I treated the first movie like a guilty pleasure, I have decided to rewatch this one anyway to see if it held up.What I dislike is that the below average CGI hasn't changed a bit from last time, Alvin's first line ""We're back"" may creep haters of these movies out, Alvin is more stupid than before and Toby is equally bad when it comes to this subject, the jokes are a hit or miss (mostly miss), the acting is poor (especially from Tony), they shove in way too many songs sung by the Chipmunks like with the other installments, the use of stock sounds (e.g the Frank Welker cat sounds), it follows a lot of the cliches from other American high school movies, loads of product placement, the Chippetes and Chipmunks don't meet until halfway through the movie, more toilet humor is used, they literally repeat the song Single Ladies many times throughout the film, and this is less faithful to the source material (the music label) than the first one.What I like is the scene where the dog tries to kill Alvin through the TV, the ""We're back"" line is perfect material for an Alvin horror fanfiction, the voice acting is fine, the Chippetes make an appearance, some of the jokes make sense, Ian does a decent job as a villain again even if this is the last time this character takes this role before reforming in the third one, the Alvin breaking the Tv scene is the best part of this movie, at least the Chipmunks get enough screen time, great use of dancing, a passable climax, 2 decent dance numbers towards the end, and Ian's defeat is very entertaining to watch.Overall, I found this movie to be worse than the first one, but thankfully better than the third one.

Perhaps that's why I ended up giving up a 7.Look, this is not Hamlet, Citizen Kane or Duck Soup. This is a PG film that as close to being family friendly than I have seen. I can only imagine the PG rating was due to the fact that the chipettes were darn right sexy - I didn't hear any vulgarity, see any nudity, violence or adult situations.It is really getting hard to find a film where I can take my 9 year old daughter to. With battling giant robots, vampires, and giant smurfs lurking in 3D, this movie was a relief to see.The plot is paper thin - though in its defense it did have an ethical base of family, friendship, and responsibility.The effects were top notch, and there were a few times I even laughed (which was a few more times than I expected).In one word it was - 'Cute' - which is exactly what I think it sought out to be. Nothing more.. Nothing less. Harmless fluff.My 9 year old enjoyed it. And at the end of the day, that's all that mattered to me.This is a film for children. Taken on it's level, I give it a 7. if you want to rate it as art or entertainment for adults? Yeah, mebbe a 2 or 3. But you know what? Some kids were clapping at parts in the theater.

For the Squeakquel it has songs, laughs, and brand new competition for Alvin and his brothers.It is already obvious from the previews that the Chipettes are making their debut in the Squeakquel. The way they debut brings back an old enemy of Alvin and his brothers. Ian comes back to cause more trouble. Lying to the Chipettes, putting them up against Alvin and the Chipmunks, and trying to put an end to the Chipmunks singing career once and for all. So now the Chipmunks are going to school and they must compete against the Chipettes for the spot of representing their school in a charity competition so that they can save the school's music program. As Alvin learns that he must choose between his brothers or being the number one star with no one else there to take the spotlight from him.Many new things happen in this movie, bringing new material to build on a sequel that can be pretty good now that everyone has been introduced to the movies.

I never saw the first one, but within the context of it being a kids' movie, it was actually quite well made. I actually laughed at the jokes, and I'm 33 and educated. If I were a young kid, I'd love this movie a lot, but I'm way past that and am often quite critical of children's genre films these days. The plot was coherent and the moral issues were clear. The characters stay true to themselves, much to anyone who is a fan of the original cartoon characters, and the dynamic of character triads works well for moral storytelling.The moral lesson to be taught is about learning to be selfless and considerate of others. This is explored through Alvin and his ego problem, and the consequences it has on his friends and family. Other characters have their own arcs as well, and they read clear and convincingly.On the downside, I think there are some choices that hurt the quality. Dave, the most famous human character in the franchise is probably in the film for about 5 minutes total, however the human characters we're left with are good performers with decent subplots. I did not care for the cliché use of a fart joke, but I forgive it because there was only one, and it was used in a way that's actually still funny to adults.Sure, it's not the most intellectual film for an adult audience, but it serves its purpose and achieves its goals, despite being the result of commercialism.

The chipmunks start going to school after Dave gets injured at The Chipmunk's concert. For what, when they can already talk and especially sing? Besides, in this movie Dave hires an elderly babysiter who got injured after falling down some stairs while she was in her wheeling chair. Now the chipmunks are with the babysiter's lazy grandson, Toby. Oh yes, at school The Chipmunks met ""The Chippets"". The Chippets are the girl version of The Chipmunks, and now somehow go to the same school now! Ian Hawk was homeless one day and found The Chippets and started to become rich again. Meanwhile, The Chipmunks were losing popularity so they wanted The Chippets to join them instead of being with Ian since he was being so bossy. Towards the end of the movie, there's a talent show for $25,000. The Chipmunks wanted the Chippets to preform with them. But, Ian was gettng ready to take the Chippets to the airport, Alvin drives a toy motercycle to save the girls. After Alvin gets the girls, Ian finds them and drives a toy helecopter. Somehow, they got the remote to the helecopter and was able to drive back to the high school and won the talent show. Dave returns during the talent show and decides to keep The Chippets as 'family"". At the very end, Alvin and Dave flick on and off the lights arguing about school and that Alvin isn't tired to go to bed. Aa Dave tries to come to Alvin when he still has crouches on, Alvin switches the light off and dave slips on a random skateboard and falls. Funny, right? The end!I remember back in 2009, nobody in my theater laughed, except for that scene where Toby does a dutch oven on Thedore. Still, not so funny.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

48,arginnon,"Bad jokes, irritating characters.",1,4 May 2012,"This movie just fails on so many levels. It is terrible, I couldn't even sit through it. Don't watch it, ever, don't even show it to your kids, because they might like it at the time, but they'll get brain damage or something. So just don't check it out, definitely not, if you have to pay for it.Okay, let's start with the title. Squeakquel? Really? What the hell is that? Squeaking sequel? Did the producers think this was a funny and clever title? Let me tell you something: IT'S NOT! Moving on. The jokes. They're not funny. A poor old lady in a wheelchair falling down the stairs? Come on! Who wrote this crap? Stephen Hawking? (You see, that's an example of a bad, tasteless, offensive joke. The movie is full of them.)One big problem in the film is, that the supporting characters tend to forget that the Chipmunks are, well damn chipmunks and not kids! Squirrels (even if they talk) are allowed to go to school? They need someone to babysit them? They're rock stars for god's sake? Gosh Another thing that caught my attention: when those kids put the squirrels into the toilet, isn't that animal cruelty? Shouldn't they go to prison for that or something?All in all, this film is really stupid, badly written and annoying. The studio must be thinking that kids are stupid and all kinds of crap is good for them. Sorry if I cursed a lot, but this movie offended me by how bad it was. It's not the case where something is so bad it's good, it's just very bad.I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.

50,wwgrayii,"Not terrible, but not very good",6,1 January 2010,"Let's face it: ""The Chipmunks"" is a pretty thin premise. Once you get past the novelty of squeaky voiced animated rodents, there's really not much there. So this movie's straight-line, A to B to C story is a serious drawback.Director Betty Thomas doesn't get a whole lot out of the cast (although, to be honest, I don't expect much in the way of high-caliber acting in movies like this), and the whole thing has a bit of a TV-movie feel, but the animation is rather good, and the film moves moves along at a pretty good clip, so even adults won't get too bored.Certainly, for some reviewers, a film like this, in the final analysis, is perfectly acceptable, since it's ""for kids,"" and thus the only thing that counts is whether it's ""entertaining"" on some basic level, regardless of its actual quality. That's a pretty common attitude toward kids' films, and one that really sells children short, as if they have no interest in character or story. They do, just like anyone else, albeit on a less sophisticated level than (most) adults. For example, I know that a lot of reviewers hated ""Hotel for Dogs"" but that film had an engaging story, well-drawn characters and a story that, while ultimately predictable, still held a few twists and turns. It wasn't particularly good, but it was better than this film.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

It often is quite witty, with good writing - and to me the animation of the chipmunks and chippette's steals the show - I love watching how they got the mannerisms and facial expressions down. This movie is just plain fun.It is awesome to watch movies where the cast seems to have such a good time portraying their characters. Also the parody of the rock star status symbol is hilarious. Now that I have seen this one, I will have to eventually dig up the original Chipmunks movie to see how that one compares. A plus to watching a great animated movie like this is to compare over the years how animation has changed - to see what they are able to do now, and compare it to animation works of years past, which often for their day was groundbreaking.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
52,2001mmFilm,True Showman-Chip!,8,21 September 2021,"It's hilarious the amount of middle-aged ""film critics"" sincerely dogging out my boys. Alvin and the Chipmunks 2: The Squeakquel is the pinnacle of the heavily derided live-action Chipmunk Quadrilogy - And I seemed to think so from day 1, having rented this as an eight year old in 2009 from Blockbuster Video, of course. Let me also issue a total ""un-ironic alert"". There's some funny 10-Star Reviews on IMDb, claiming this to be the greatest piece of cinema of all time. Not quite. Of course, there is nothing to admire here from a filmmaking standpoint. There doesn't need to be. Kids don't care about that stuff yet, and for that reason Pixar exists... But I'm young at heart, and a silly care-free story about CGI rodents going to High School is fun enough without any emotional weight.The big draw of The Squeakquel is the introduction of The Chipettes; female variants of Alvin, Simon and Theodore. I love it. Put simply, that's the fault of The Road Chip (2015), I don't think The Chipmunks are complete without The Chipettes. In the first movie it worked because it was the starting point for everything to follow. Chipwrecked (2011), absolutely bonkers as it is, still features them prominently... I don't care what anyone says, seeing all six of these Chipmunks interact is adorable. They're a family, as they sing in the finale of this movie, although... I think they've got the hots for each other, too. But I digress.The contractual return of David Cross is excellent. He's just so watchable, with his passive-aggressive, neurotic attitude - A highlight of these movies for the adult viewers too. He just plays the biggest douche so perfectly, and maybe it's his reluctance towards the material that just helps sell this persona even more. I love how he's the villain for a second time around, even though I prefer new villains per entry. The story continues, even though there's not much of a story, essentially. His desperate ""look at me"" to a rat in the sub-level of his former Jett Records building is gold. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) gets injured onstage by Alvin's recklessness and spends the majority of the runtime bedridden in hospital. Supplanting him is the best character in the movie, Zachary Levi's Toby. He is a genuinely likeable and charismatic presence throughout, and you can see why he's such a star today. The best jokes come from Toby, as does the best side-plot involving his High School crush, played by Anjelah Johnson Reyes. This didn't need to be in the movie, but the guy sells it well enough that you can only give a thumbs up. Playing a bumbling, awkward twenty something year-old, Zachary also delivers this really heartfelt, heartwarming scene in the end, where he sings an impromptu song to this girl. I don't know... The camera holds on him staring at her before he begins, and a lot is conveyed through the silence. I guess what I'm saying is, this movie doesn't get enough credit. It's so often dismissed as contrived, annoying kids tripe, which it is for a majority of the runtime, but there is stuff to appreciate here. There is the conflict between brothers, Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Alvin (Justin Long), and their eventual making-up. It's a nice arc for children and their siblings to latch on to. I have fun with this movie, still as a young adult myself. Either it's doing something right or I'm just nostalgic. The songs are of the era, late 2000's, and a few classics thrown in here and there. They're a guilty pleasure whenever I watch - Sue me. I like Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 a fair bit. It's harmless family entertainment, cutesy and occasionally funny. Even series creator Ross Bagdasarian would attest that The Squeakquel shows true SHOWMAN-CHIP.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
53,neonboy619,"The Chipmunks - Squeakquel: Chipettes Almost Steal the Show, Almost",6,21 August 2010,"I'm a huge Chipmunk fan. It's not Jem but it never failed to please. I looked forward every afternoon to hearing Alvin and the Chipmunks do their take on modern songs at the time. My ultimate favorite is still their rendition of ""For the Longest Time"" and I could never forget The Chipettes and The Chipmunks singing ""The Boys and Girls of Rock n' Roll"" in their 2d animated feature debut.Now The Chipmunks have made the leap from 2d to CGI. I didn't like the first CGI Chipmunks movie and it had nothing to do with the fact that Dave was out of character, the story was predictable, the villain not threatening enough and the boys really looked like real chipmunks. It had nothing to do with that. The movie just didn't come together. I could make a list of my gripes with this movie, but this review is for it's sequel, which recycles what was in the first movie, but with some very welcome additions. I'm a huge fan of Jason Lee. I can't get enough of him in ""Mallrats."" I thought he was perfectly cast as Dave in the first movie. I wish someone had told the writers that. Dave was oddly out of character in the first movie and that bugged the hell out of me. Gladly, this is remedied in this second outing. Kinda'. Now Dave is in the hospital for most of the film. I wish they didn't have do this, but Dave feels like Dave now. I didn't like the villain in the first movie, played by comedian David Cross. I was surprised he came back to play the same role. He was very public about how his involvement in the 1st movie was more about exposure and had nothing to do with him actually liking the material. Well, here he is again, exposed. Not the good naked exposed. He does the same exact thing he did in the first movie in this movie, but this time with The Chipettes, so I don't mind him as much. The best thing to happen to The Chipmunk franchise: The Chipettes. The leader, Britany, is voiced by the awesome Christina Applegate, chubby and cute Eleanor is voiced by Amy Phoeler and brainy Jeanette is voiced by Anna Farris. all are perfectly cast. The boys in this one experience a rift in their relationships as they attend High School and experience how the social order can rip innocent little chipmunks apart. A highlight of the conflict is when the boys tell a bunch of bullies that they're going to build a nest in them. Creepy. But alas, I wanted more of the girls, and they get second billing in this movie. The scenes they are in however allow them to shine. The same cast that plays Alvin and the Chipmunks (Justin Long as Alvin, Matthew Gray Gubler as Simon and Jesse McCartney as Theodore) return to reprise their roles. Don't expect too much here. This movie is strictly for kids. I only gave a hoot about it because those Chipettes are so darn cute. You all should check out the CD. I barely liked the first CGI outing, but this one I'll rewatch just for those Chipette performances.Check out my Movie Page:http://neonboy619.blogspot.com",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
54,doom1701,Ironic that no one ever complains that these movies disrespect the original cartoons...,7,25 December 2009,"I read reviews of movies like Transformers and see people saying that Michael Bay did various bodily functions on their childhood for completely ignoring the cartoon/comics that started it all. Then I read reviews of the Chipmunk movies where people just call them garbage...and almost never mention the original cartoons. And yet I know that many of the reviewers are my age and grew up watching the cartoons in the 80's (or reruns of the originals from the 60's). The source material isn't Shakespeare...it's a cartoon about singing rodents. Don't ask for too much story.Both the original movie and the Squeakquel are, IMO, very true to the source. They've got heart, they've got slapstick, and they've got plenty of camp and stupid humor that you should really expect from a movie about talking chipmunks. I enjoyed the Squeakquel even more than the original because Jason Lee's ""Dave"" was almost completely non-existent. He's simply a terrible choice for the role. After being incapacitated in the first minutes of the Squeakquel, Zachary Levi's ""Toby"" basically fills in and does a great job. They should have just recast ""Dave"" with Zachary, instead of keeping Jason Lee but realizing that he's terrible in the role.Don't go see this and complain that it was an insult to your intelligence. Go to the movie expecting a bunch of over the top (and often totally childish) humor with some cool music and a good (albeit simple and hokey) family story. If you liked the cartoons, you'll like the first movie and the Squeakquel.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

It's like ya ll trying to make the chipmunks live independently by them living with their cousin Toby. Toby is a lazy gamer that does nothing but plays video games! Leaving it up to the chipmunks to take care of themselves. Will they enjoy peace while Dave is away? Nope! They go to school that has students much bigger then them! And unfortunately, they have a rough time with the students as they are being bullied and used! And not only that, they run into their Nemesis, Ian! Who has a set of female singing chipmunks aka chipettes. Unaware, they are being used to make money for Ian by putting them on a real stage! Chipmunks are used by the principle to give music back go the school. Now for ratings of each element of the film: Story: some parts should change or remove.

56,deventhakkar,"A great, fantastic sequel",8,12 September 2015,"I really like how the surprise introduction of the Chipettes saves this film from being too boring as the beginning just shows the chipmunks wrecking havoc and causing trouble, this time, Toby (unlike Dave) rarely cares about their mischief but later on he does become protective and caring and starts taking on some responsibility. The Locker Reveal scene in the film was probably the most heartwarming and romantic part, when the Chipmunks and Chipettes meet each other in the school hallway for the first time, they both are love struck upon seeing each other (look at their faces, they flash toothy smiles at each other) but it is ruined when Ian manipulates the Chipettes into making them not trust the Chipmunks and make them think they are evil. Ian's role is quite evil ad I think this will terrify the kids. Jason Lee's role was reduced significantly here, he barely appears but I'm glad Mike Mitchell expanded his role in the third film. Overall, this film may be flawed but it's freshly squeezed comedic energy and great family fun.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

And the whole movie they just try to save the schools music program against the girl chipmunks. Which were really annoying. The characters suck, its unfunny (didn't laugh once), there's a bunch of stupid cameos that kids wouldn't understand, and is by far the worst of the three. Watch the other two, there fine.

They're three annoying little critters with ridiculously high pitched voices.In this particular flick, Alvin's human ""father"" Dave has to go into the hospital. (I won't reveal the reason why in case you do want to still see the film.)Alvin and his two equally irritating brothers are shipped off to stay with Aunt Jackie, a kind old woman.Well, an accident happens and they're stuck with Toby instead, the bumbling, incompetent nephew of poor Aunt Jackie.So in come the ""Chipettes"", a trio of female chipmunks who have big dreams of becoming famous. Brittany is the squeaky voiced leader. Equally annoying as Alvin and a bit of a diva. Jeanette is the intelligent, reasonable one and is the obvious counterpart to Simon. Eleanor is the plump, pigtailed one and the least annoying of the bunch.Once they come in, Ian, Alvin's former manager, also arrives back in the picture, eager to sign them up to his record label.Ian, the diabolical over-the-top antagonist who is just so outrageously Machiavellian and money-hungry. It's so obvious of his intentions. David Cross is a great actor. But this crappy movie doesn't do him justice as it renders his character into a one dimensional stereotypical villain.Well, the Chipettes and the Chipmunks both wind up going to high school and entering the social hierachy. Predictably, Alvin is extremely popular among the female students.Then comes in a sub-plot about a new school singing contest in which Alvin and his brothers go up against their female squeaking counterparts.It's so ridiculously cliché.You know from the get-go what's going to happen.Every character is so one-dimensional. Every character is portrayed with one mere personality trait that's dwelled on throughout the entire film.Example: Alvin's the ""star"". Hubris for him. Brittany's the diva. Jeanette's the logical voice of reason. Stereotypically, they give her over-sized eyeglasses and make her ectormophic. Theodore's the ""cute"" snuggly one. Make him adorable but do nothing else to the character. Eleanor's the insecure one. Well, make her short and kowtowing to the screen's antagonist and caving into his demands to wear high heels! Toby's the bumbling moron. Ian's the archetypal villain.....Etc, etc.Do we have to have these points shoved down our throats? We get it! We understand who is the brainy one and who is the dumb one! Also, it's just not a funny nor cute film.Toby's flatulence is not funny. Alvin's moronic one-liners are not funny. ""Toot my own horn! BEEEP! BEEEP! BEEEEEEEP!""The Chipettes are annoying and you just want to squash them! Watch them butcher Beyonce's hit song ""Single Ladies"".

Some take away comments from the mouth of babes: ""Is it over YET?"" ""I'm bored"" and my personal favorite ""That wasn't so funny at all.""

Keep in mind that I can watch intelligent, award-winning films that make me think about the future of the human race, but I don't want to do that all the time.And personally, the film does have some good values to be found, as well as some songs that, if they were sung by anyone else, I wouldn't touch them with a 20ft pole! To those who refuse to see this film based on what others say I say this, the Chipmunks have been around for 50+ years, and are a world renowned group. This is coming from someone who grew up with the old cartoons, but I realize that the image needed a change if it was to catch on with today's audience, just like it had to in the 1980's.This film, while not as good as the first one, is no where near as bad as it has been rated, and to me, those who give it a 2, 3, 4, or anything less than at least a 7, obviously have been brainwashed with way too much High School Musical or too many serious films and they expect everything to be a masterpiece.To anyone who actually uses their brain, please, chill out, relax, and enjoy the film.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

This film follows them good, but something could have been better. I love the first Alvin and the Chipmunks film, but I never was a fan of the series.Pop sensations Alvin, Simon and Theodore end up in the care of Dave Seville's twenty-something nephew Toby (Levi). The boys must put aside music super-stardom to return to school, and are tasked with saving the school's music program by winning the $25,000 prize in a battle of the bands. But the Chipmunks unexpectedly meet their match in three singing chipmunks known as The Chipettes -– Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette. Romantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off.Now the CGI was very well done. The Chipmunks look even more real this time around. The interactions with them were perfect, almost as if they really are there in front of the actors. The acting was good. I wish they showed a little more of Dave Seville, as it wasn't the same without him around with the Chipmunks. The Chipettes were an good inclusion. But I felt as if there wasn't any bonding between the Chipmunks and Chipettes. It felt rushed, which is one of the problems I had with this movie, like the last. It felt like they rushed through this just to keep the kiddies awake. I felt more character development could have been shown. I was expecting something more with the ending. And expecting a little more rivalry, between the Chipmunks and Chipettes, and the Chipmunks themselves.All in all, good movie. A nice little piece of entertainment. If you are a fan of the last movie, or a fan of the Chipmunks in all, you'll enjoy it.

He's like, alright, you got me once you're not gonna get me again. So he's in one scene in the beginning and then you never see him again. Now Dave wants them to get an education so they go to high school and...and CHIPMUNKS DON'T GO TO HIGH SCHOOL!!! It would be different if it were a chipmunk high school but no, they go to a human high school where they have to worry about not getting stepped on. And then the jocks, now these are the wimpiest jocks i've ever seen. They're extremely jealous of the chipmunks for no reason and start picking on them. So they want to beat up...chipmunks doesn't really make a lot of sense. And meanwhile they have to win a contest to...(chuckles) get back the school music program.

I was expected much improved and powerful story, but it seems to be a rush production over the popularity of the first one. The chipmunks are meant to be children. But they are going for higher grade in school. The musical contests are just crazy events. They were just included to make the story. The fights and events over teenagers and chipmunks are just funny, useless and sometimes made me sick. Common! Those are chipmunks. You have 3 gr8 GCI characters.

It's by far the most entertaining film of 2009.If you hate wet-your-paints funny humor, good musical harmony, and stories with substance, you will hate this film. If you enjoy being entertained on various levels and perhaps getting something to think about along the way you will LOVE this film.Part of me thinks it's about a bunch of adults who don't want to admit how dearly they love something from their childhood. After all, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is on target to be the #1 weekend movie. The kids aren't bringing themselves to the theaters folks.If you came on this site to see if you should go to this movie, you should go. Apparently most of the other reviewers wouldn't know good entertainment if it had fur and sang.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
69,jwtrout,Funny and cute,8,2 January 2010,"Went tonight with the whole family. Laughed quite a lot and so did the kids. The inside jokes were pretty funny. It's a cute, little movie, cleaner than the first one as far as innuendos go. Kids will like it, parents will like that the kids like it and if you have the kind of sense of humor that I do, you will laugh, too! When I read a review about a movie that is meant for teens and adults, I want to know whether it is ridiculous or worth seeing. When I read a review for a kids' movie, I want to know whether it is clean and funny and whether it can teach my kids a lesson or not. This movie WAS clean and funny and taught my kids once again the importance of family and keeping your word. Why can't that be enough? Why does a kids' movie have to have lots of substance? Why can't it just be cute and sweet,like the TV show was all those years ago? ""We're the Chipmunks,C-H-I-P-M-U-N-K! We're the Chipmunks, guaranteed to brighten your day!"" :-)",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
70,alicia_holt,Not as good as the first version,5,23 January 2010,"Although I liked the Chipmunks, I really found it was not quite the same without Dave.This is not a film to be taken seriously, and maybe I didn't find it was amazing because of my taste in films.There really wasn't a plot. It was nice to see the furry things again, though.But if you're looking for an amazing film to remember this year, go see Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea.Despite the fact the plot isn't amazing and the jokes are corny, it really isn't too bad of a film. If you need a film just for a cheap laugh by all means go and see it.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
71,Auntie_Annie,"Good, so long as you don't expect a serious film",6,28 December 2009,"I really enjoyed this film, but mostly because I went in with the expectation that I would have an hour and a half of laughs and general fun, not a serious film. I have seen the first film, and this isn't as good as it, but probably because film makers always use up all there best ideas in the first films, very few sequels live up to or surpass the originals. Obviously it's not the sort of film you can watch again and again, the jokes are clichéd and will quickly become old to anyone over the age of about 8. It never ceases to amaze me why adults go and see a children's film and somehow expect a serious film. All in all, good fun, the quality of the film isn't bad. Children will enjoy this, and their parents won't be bored by it either!",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
72,rhermanto,Ridiculously ridiculous,2,29 December 2009,Went to see the movie with my 12y.o and 9y.o kids. The movie even bored them to tears. Slightly more entertaining for the 12y.o daughter cos she knows couple of hit songs. The storyline is super ridiculous. Chipmunks going to highschool???? Cmon!!! The acting is also bogus. I think its totally pointless of putting big names to voice the chipmunks as it will be altered to high pitch anyway.The computer graphics and the artists however deserve a recognition. The mimic and movement are superbly rendered. That's probably the only good note about the movie. My suggestion: don't bring above 4.y.o. Better save the money for their college fund.,Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
73,kitkat_elle,Alvin the chipmunks - great!!!!! :),9,27 January 2010,"Alvin and the chipmunks the squequel is the second installment to the alvin and the chipmunks series, in this film the chipmunks have to face trying to live a normal life in high school whilst they also have to compete against a singing group of female chipmunks who they are all in love with in a school music compettitionI could not believe the amount of negative reviews on this film!!!!! I thought that it was a fantastic movie enjoyed by all.I was entertained throughout the whole movie and found the humour extremely funny. People say that even kids didn't enjoy this movie but that is definitely not true as all the kids in the movie theatre i went to were all laughing their heads off.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
74,Ratsonrop,Overall a decent movie for the kids,6,21 March 2010,"I brought my little cousins to watch this movie recently. I was actually quite surprised with it. I was not expecting much from it, but it did entertain me as an adult, which is a bonus when bringing children to a movie that is directed at them. There was definitely a lot of adult humor within the movie as well, that probably was well above the head of children. I also found it funny that they continually made the young adult that was playing video games all day look like a loser, as it demonstrates to children that while it may be fun to play video games here and there, making it your full time job really leaves you with little of a life. I think they chose very good upbeat songs to play, which was a bonus. Also, as an aside to anyone that has watched the hangover and laughed at the end when they show pictures of what happened to them in Vegas, I felt this movie kind of spoofed that movie, as it played the same song at the end and had pictures of them doing funny things. Anyways, to summarize, while I probably would have waited myself to see this on television or on rental if I was very desperate to choose a movie, it surprised me, and is a great children's movie.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
75,yeelir,Better than The Dark Knight we need more movies like this..,4,18 March 2016,"To start me off we have some great sequels. Aliens, The Dark Knight, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and T-2. All those movies look like crap compared to Alvin and the Chipmunks 2. Alvin and the Chipmunks was great, absolutely fantastic. BUT Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 might be better. Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 features Jason Lee as Dave in yet another Oscar worthy role. Jason Lee has the amazing ability to show a great amount of emotion and just the power of acting. I'm very upset he will not be receiving an Oscar for the role of Dave. Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 also best be taking home a visual effects Oscar, the visuals are amazing and the chipmunks look amazing. The writing for the film is also very well done. The dialogue fits in very well and just makes the film better than it already is. This movie might be better than the first one and should get Best Picture. What makes me upset is that the movie didn't even got nominated for Best Picture. Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 is a great movie with wonderfully amazing acting, screenplay, visuals, directing, writing and just all around entertaining movie. I could go on with everything great about Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 because it is such an amazing movie. Alvin and the chipmunks is better than ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."" Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 gets an A+. I AM AN IDIOT AND MY REVIEW SUCKS IM ALSO LIAR. THANK YOU.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
76,millenniumf,Good film for families,8,29 June 2010,"I'm puzzled by the number of poor reviews some are giving this film. It's not The Godfather, Shutter Island, or Scent of a Woman. Heck, it's not even Star Wars.This is Alvin and the Chipmunks, for crying out loud. If you want deep messages, incredible dialogue and profound story, go rent 2001: A Space Odyssey.The message of this film is plain and simple: family is your most important resource, and sacrificing it to attain your own goals will come back to bite you BIG TIME. In a day and age where family is often portrayed as being in the way of achieving your life goals, it's a big relief to see a film that gives kids a strong moral message like this.Alvin's egotistical antics and selfishness are brought out in this film. He is led on by the jocks and is allowed on the football team. The fact that he isn't even that valued by the team is evident in that he wasn't even put in the game till they were almost defeated anyway, so what did they have to lose with a (questionably legal) Hail Mary pass? This of course sails right over his head, and instead of keeping his promise to his brother, Simon, he goes out partying. Brittany hit the nail right on the head when she said, ""You don't care about anyone but yourself."" Alvin wants to retort, but instead swallows hard. When he arrives home, he goes to the bedroom and tries to apologize to his brothers, but of course they are so deeply hurt by his selfishness that they don't even bother to reply! That's a whole new level of hurt right there, and you can tell just how down about the whole thing Alvin is by the sigh he lets out when he sinks into bed.Simon is a good role-model in this movie, because he is the most mature of the three. Dave was wise letting him be in charge, as we can see later when Simon tries (and fails) to hold the family together by making Alvin promise not to miss the sing-off. Another good character trait in Simon is his family values. He highly values his relationship with his brothers, and you can tell how deeply it cut him when Alvin let him be made a fool of with the whole 'litter monitor' joke. Yes, he is a bit anal-retentive and even has a bit of an ego, but it's clear he is the most respectable of the trio.Theodore is also a good character in this film, but not as an example kids should follow. Rather, he is the glue that holds the 'family' together in this film. It was so cool to see Alvin and Simon come to his defense so readily. I don't see too many families where older brothers (at least, more mature ones) would come to the aid of a younger brother like this. When Theodore hurts in this film, it just tears your heart out, because he's so innocent. He's the shy kid who doesn't really fit in, and his vulnerability is very endearing. His heart of gold is most apparent when he tells Eleanor how he thinks she's just fine the way she is. How many guys could be counted upon to be that honest? In the end analysis, Squeakquel isn't the most ground-breaking film of all time. It isn't world-shattering, it's not block-busting, and it's not anything more than fluff when you get right down to it. But at it's heart is a good, clean message that should be something every kid in the world needs to be reminded of every once in a while: Family is your most priceless possession. Cherish it. You'll never realize just how precious it is . . . till you lose it.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
77,Mississippi20,Cute and entertaining all the way through!,9,31 December 2009,"I have to laugh at the comments about ""not having substance."" Um, this is 'Alvin and the Chipmunks,' right? If you really are concerned about what ""messages"" this movie is sending your children (or....yourself?), then there is a plain, easy-to-grasp theme about family and friends sticking together. I'm not sure what else you want.Beyond that, the film is very cute, funny, and entertaining all the way through. The female-counterpart ""Chipettes"" add something new, but don't take away from the Chipmunks. Zachary Levin and David Cross are charming and amusing in their respective roles. If you liked the first movie, then you will be entertained by the ""squeakquel.""",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

My suggestion is that they shouldn't have even made a sequel, or in this case, a sqeakuel. Last film was fine: a group of talking chipmunks found and made famous.When I went to watch this at a pre-screening, it was awful: my cousin was asleep, and I was just crying to get out of the theatre. Now, the storyline is awful: those talking chipmunks go to school, and face against some other talking chipmunks in this band contest. In my opinion, I thought that was a really weak storyline.However, this is just a perfect film for small kids. Lessons taught about being considerate to others, being kind, and those other lessons.But as entertainment, I'd rather have watched Barney.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

Maybe not the best film ever but its not bad, sometime we laughing, and if you say no joke is funny you lying. I pretty sure you laugh here and there. I do laugh with some joke, even it is stupid but sometime stupid joke still funny, and I see kids enjoy the film and I believe they enjoy it because they think its good film for them.

Basically the three chipmunks we all love from the previous movie have to go to school where they meet a rival female chipmunk band. Now, there are one or two things wrong with the plot. First of all, the plot is quite predictable...but not up to the point of not being surprised here and there. Second, the chipmunks get annoying after a while, but that's a minor setback. Moving away from the cons, let's go to the pros. The acting of the cast members are quite good; I found them to be quite believable. I also liked the music sang by the chipmunks (they're squeaky versions of the songs we love in this present world).All in all, I'd give this movie a 6/10.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
81,tyler199555,The Squekwal you know it's going to be good,9,2 April 2010,I loved this movie it had the cute and innocence of the old chipmunks and enough modernization to be a great film. I would have to say the visual effects on the chipmunks was greatly improved. It seems as though the chipettes were made to look more fluffy and cute than the chipmunks. it was a good idea to introduce the chipettes. It also seems this movie showed a more aggressive Simon speaking of him I noticed that Simonand and Jenette never actually talked to each other until the end of the movie and it was over the phone so that might not count. I can't wait to see what they do for a third movie I think it should revolve more around the chipmunks and chipettes relationship's's.,Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

True, I did like the first movie better overall and I did have some problems with this one. The character of Toby was just awful. Like someone else wrote...a flat piece of cardboard. No chemistry with the Chipmunks. The high school jock storyline with Alvin wasn't nearly as entertaining as the original movies storyline. Still, it has some priceless moments and I would watch Theodore do just about anything. How sweet when he said...""Shes like a beautiful green gumdrop"". His fascination with Meerkat Manor was great and of course, the poor munk is still having nightmares. Hopefully, the next one has Dave back full time.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

Anyone who has seen the original Chipmunks knows that this is just what they are: a silly comedy for kids that has no sex, violence, or foul language. The whole story outline wasn't the best but it has all the things that make the Chipmunks what they are. Little kids will love it and the adults won't mind watching it with them (though if they watch it too much it will get old).

85,sweetmocha008,For Alvin and the Chipmunk Fans Only...,7,24 October 2010,"Clearly, most of the people who rated this movie poorly are those who are unfamiliar with the Alvin and the Chipmunks brand. The plot of the this movie wasn't great, but the film was dead on with the way the main characters were portrayed. Alvin, the mischievous, always getting into trouble... Simon, the genius, going toe to toe against Alvin's shenanigans... and Theodore, the big-hearted, trying to keep the peace between his two brothers. Even Jason Lee is dead on as Dave.Some people commented on how 'crazy' it is for chipmunks to go to school with humans, but that's the whole point! It's already crazy that they talk, sing, wear clothes, and see a human as their dad, so what's one more thing? Besides, I do believe they went to school during the series in the 80's. If you had an issue with it being HIGH school, I can see that, because the chipmunks were suppose to be, in theory, comparable to kids 8-11 years old, so elementary school would have been more appropriate, but either way, if my memory serves me correctly, the original characters did go to school with HUMANS.The bottom line is that this movie just isn't for everyone. If Alvin and the Chipmunks were before or AFTER your time, then maybe you just won't get it. As a matter of fact, if you know you didn't grow up with Alvin and the Chipmunks yourself, then don't waste your time taking your kids to see the movie either, because you will surely ruin it for them. As a kid of the 80's, I don't really need of ""thought-provoking"" Academy Award plot...

Add some childishly cheap computer graphics, And then talk about sex, And show dishonest and mischievous behavior. This movie tries to play like its a harmless kids film. When in reality the concepts reinforced over and over again in this film are to be disobedient. The use of sexual connotation is rampant. I see parents right review after review of how harmless and okay for kids this film is. These are the same parents who let their children watch anything Disney puts out and allow their children to listen to Britney Spears, And Christina Aguilera (both of whom were mousekateers) .

Especially considering this is a kids movie and mine loved it! Okay, so it was not as good as the original, but how many sequels are? I took my kids to see this Christmas Eve. I thought it would be a nice way to start the holiday. I have a 7 year old son, and my daughter is almost 2. They both had a blast! My 2 year old had fallen asleep on the way to the theatre, but it didn't make her upset to wake up in a movie theatre minutes later, she thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie. I thought the writers did a great job at making a movie so similar to the TV show on when I was a kid, with only minor differences. It may have been obvious to me what was going to happen, but all the kids were really sitting there wondering ""what's next"". That's all we can really ask for.

Animaton was spot on, humour was good (not too over done), music choice, like in the first movie was excellent.If you want to put a smile on your kids face this Christmas then you could do a lot worse than Alvin & The Chipmunks.It's worth remembering when commenting on this type of movie that it's a kids film, targeted at an immature audience.Overall, for amusement I would give it 7/10, my 5 year old 10/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
90,lovethoseyanks,Cute movie for toddlers and preschoolers,8,26 December 2009,"My son who is 4 years old loved it. Yes, from an adult's perspective the movie line is very similar to the first movie, but this is a def must see if you have small children. No profanity, popular songs, and a high speed chase keeps the little ones interested throughout this movie. I was able to sit through the entire movie and was mildly entertained. I wasn't on the verge of falling asleep nor was I on the edge of my seat, but keep in mind that this is geared towards children. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie if your children liked the first movie. If you are an adult and mildly liked the first movie and do not have kids and are thinking about going to see this movie, wait for it to come out on DVD. Overall I think this movie is still a good movie, just slightly below the first movie. In my opinion, I would have rather rented the DVD for myself, but with the kids involved this made for an excellent Father/Son night out at the movies.

The story and the humans in this film-different thing altogether.Someone got the Disney bug about putting their characters in a school setting.OK,kids can relate,and the cartoon series ended with the Chipmunks and Chipettes in school.The humans in the film-painful to watch really.Ethan Hawke did not learn anything from his loss of the Chipmunks.Dave is in hospital most of the time(thank goodness).The goober they have to fill in for him is a troglodyte.It may have been easier to take the cartoonishness of the human cast had it been done all CGI. I still loved the film for the moments where everything worked.I hope they get a better script next time!",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
93,bighead-0,"Decent. movie, could have been better...",7,7 January 2010,"I can honestly say the movie itself was only decent, I did expect better and this is coming from a huge fan of the chipmunks, dating back to the early 80's when the cartoon series reined. I enjoyed the first 3D chipmunk movie, I watched it a few times and there wasn't too much with it that I did not like. But this movie... it had me smile a few times, other times it kinda let me down because it did not live up to my expectations.One of the BIGGEST disappointments to me was the limited interaction the chipmunks and chipettes had with each other throughout the movie. It certainly wasn't like the old cartoons where they were all together getting into mischief, competing with each other, or just plain having fun doing whatever it was they did. It was always enjoyable watching Alvin and Britney going at it, while the other 4 tried to keep them out of trouble. In this movie their interaction with each other is very limited, and when they do interact, it's mostly in depressing or angry situations. In the old cartoons, sure they squabbled, especially Alvin and Britney... but it was in a fashion that left you smile cause you know deep down they all cared. In this movie they seemed.. cold to each other, especially Alvin vs. Simon.Examples are when Alvin tries to warn Britney about Ian Hawk, Britney turns a cold shoulder to Alvin's advice and ends up on the floor covered in food, angry at Alvin. Another example is a scene showing a depressed Theodore because of his brothers fought for a good portion of the movie, Eleanore comes over to talk to him. Just when you think she's gonna cheer him up, the scene ends abruptly in my opinion. Last example is when Alvin misses the music competition and shows up late, Britney just looks at him all sad and says ""BTW, I didn't want to win this way"" then walks away.. what the heck is that? There's also the constant arguing and fighting going on with Alvin and Simon, and Theodore spends a good amount of his time being sad. I was not expecting some chipmunk love story where they all fall for each other and live happily ever after, but I did expect to see them all get along for more of the movie. The majority of the movie was about them fighting and distrusting each other, it's not the image I remember from my youth.I understand that the storyline was that Ian wanted revenge on the chipmunks, and didn't want the chipettes to trust the chipmunks so they couldn't warn them about who he really was. Simon and Alvin we're fighting because Alvin was being his egotistical self, and Theodore didn't like it. The storyline in theory was good; it's the way it was executed that kinda killed it. It felt like they tried to do too much, and accomplished so little. It's like the movie was just a bunch of short random scenes that eventually came together in some fashion, but never felt entirely complete. Again, I think I feel this way because you never really see ALL of the chipmunks together in this one, and it seems to focus on Alvin and Simon a lot more than the other four. Because this Squeakuel introduces the chipettes, by the end of the movie you feel like the chipmunks and chipettes never really got to know each other, then they all end up living together in the end?Besides the limited interaction with the chipmunks and chipettes as a whole, where was Dave? In a hospital bed almost the entire movie. Don't get me wrong I'm not a huge fan of Jason Lee, but jeez why cut Dave out of almost the entire movie? He's part of the Chipmunks franchise, and he made very limited appearances. Instead they put in some nerd cousin of David's who wants to take no responsibility and play video games. Who is this guy? I don't ever remember seeing him before, why take out Dave? I did start to kind of like him by the end, but still.. he was no replacement for Dave.So there's that, those are my biggest disappointments about the movie. Besides the flawed execution of the story, the limited interaction of the munks, and the lack of Dave.. it was enjoyable to watch. I can honestly say unless you are a chipmunk fan from the past, you probably will not like this movie. I am personally hoping for a 3rd movie just to correct the mistakes of this one, and carry on this wonderful legacy. I want to see all 6 munks running around, laughing and playing, and getting into trouble like the good old days.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel

I have worn out 2 DVDs of Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. love this movie also can't wait for it to come out in DVD so i can wear out 2 of these DVDs. i didn't really care for Toby he was kinda a flake, but then what can you do in the hospital.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
95,scooterfrangi,G rated movies are not really family movies anymore,1,12 January 2010,"I went with my family and though it was thoroughly enjoyed by the six year old, I was in pain. In The Squeakuel we see the return of Alvin, Simon and Theodore. They are told that they have to give up stardom for a short period of time while Dave's cousin takes care of them. Instead they are forced to go to school. Alvin of course gets a big head when the jocks get him in the football team. Simon becomes a nerd and Theodore sits back and watches him brothers fight. On top of this they also have some competition from three other singing, female chipmunks. Halfway through the movie you get a sense of deja-vu and then it hits you that most of the jokes are repeats from the first movie. That is aboutthe time when you start getting bored. Of course it is quite cute tosee the chipmunks and the chipettes dancing and singing, especially Theodore and his love interest. But the movie ends predictably.There was a time where a G rated family movie could be enjoyed by the whole family, take Shrek for instance. But movies like this show that G rated movies are fast becoming movies for 6 and below.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
96,cupcake-644-232967,Best Movie Ever,10,25 January 2010,"I think I loved this movie more then my kids did!!! Better then the first one. I'm going to watch this one over and over! :) This very well could me the best movie of all time. I would recommend this to everyone and their brother. The music is just awesome. I have told everyone at work that this is a must see. GREAT!!! When they were singing and dancing, I really felt like I was right there with them. There even was a point in the movie where I found my self singing and dancing with them. Alvin is by far the best singer ever. I wish I could meet him in real life. I think that would make my life complete. I plan on wearing my Chipmucks tshirt to work tomorrow to promote the movie.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
97,mcmillanjj,ignore the bad reviews!!,10,4 April 2010,This movie was great. My husband and I just watched it with our 3 year old and 18 month old and we all loved it! Our kids got up and danced during every song and actually sat and watched the movie. My youngest actually climbed up onto our entertainment center to watch it and got really excited and our oldest kept yelling at her to move so he could watch...they were both very much entertained. It was very cute and quite funny. There was nothing wrong with the story line whatsoever. There was a lot of creativeness and humor that had my husband and I laughing. Anyone that didn't like this movie has no sense of humor at all. We only rented the movie but we are going to purchase it as soon as we can! Great movie for the whole family!!!!,Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
98,supermanee412,Alvin,8,22 May 2010,"When the second Alvin and the chipmunk movie first came out, my two sisters and I went to go see it together, just like we went to go see the first movie together. Even though the three of us are in our early twenties.. we still had fun going to see both of the movies together. This movie was great. But I did not think it was as good as the first movie. I liked the first Alvin and the chipmunk movie better than the second one. I would definitely recommend this movie to other people. The end of the movie was my favorite. Also, just watching the reaction of the younger boys and girls in the theater and their reaction to some of the parts in the movie, was amazing and funny.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
99,meowhappy,This is my toddler's favorite movie,8,16 June 2010,"My two-year-old has claimed this as the movie she must watch once a day. This is a well-executed PG movie where the jokes are funny to the adults and the kids still giggle. To properly enjoy such a movie, one must simply lighten up and enjoy something cute for a couple hours. I am saddened that so many children's movies have lower scores just because it's the grown-ups that place the ratings. In my toddler's eyes this movie gets all ten fingers and all ten toes, and thank goodness she picked a film Mommy and Daddy don't mind sitting through again and again. Plus we don't have chipmunks in Hawaii so it's awesome for her to learn about them. Yes she knows its not normal for animals to talk, lol.Bottom line: how can you hate furry dancing chipmunks?",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
100,agfband,awesome,10,2 July 2010,the best movie i have ever seen i just cant get enough of it i have to watch it ever day but i did wish they would so more of the 6 of them being together but man you have to be retarded to not love this movie i'm 17 years old and give it 10 out of 10! a have to see movie by Andrew Glenn Fox 3 i'm not even afraid to write out my name after this review and i hardly like watching TV if you don't own this movie then you need to go out and purchase this wonderful film a must own if are to have a hot movie collection and you know what you might want to go out and purchase the first it wasn't as great as the sqequal but it was a good 8 out of 10 which is not all that bad and you will want to see the first again after seeing the second all i can say is as soon as the third chipmunks movie comes out i will be the first to watch it just to see more interactions between the chipettes and chipmunks just like the cartoon series and if you don't dig their singing then you have no tast in music and need to go and craw back into your hole and if you do have tast in music but don't like chipmunks music then you are proble a cutter that cuts yourself and listens to gay music.,Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
101,rushi831,Well Presented!,9,29 November 2011,"The movie, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, presented itself as a ""hyped"" success. The reason the film was the #3 grossing film on its opening weekend was primarily due to children who were just ""psyched"" to see the movie, just because everyone was talking about it, or because they had seen numerous advertisements about it.Despite bad comments from critics and children alike, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel was a fairly good film from an objective point of view. Despite the remarks, the film was true to its ambitions and goals. Considering its budget of a mere $37,000,000, the film's position on the charts was up to par with films whose budgets were multi-fold of that.Looking into the individual elements of the film, the film is a perfect blend of CGI (computer-generated imagery) and live action. I may sound quite mundane saying this, but the Chipmunks in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel and its predecessor Alvin and the Chipmunks were very realistic. I think this is what lent the greatest strength to this film.One of the few flaws in this film were the special effects. Out of the entire film,the only noticeable error error was in the ""rescue"" scene where Alvin flies on a scooter to go save the Chipettes from the evil record company owner, Ian Hawke. When Alvin is on the scooter with the Chipettes, a few high angle shots of the roads and buildings below are shown. During these shots, it is obvious that the scooter is stationary, and that only the surroundings are moving. This slight flaw takes away some thrill from that scene.Besides the flaws and comments, I really enjoyed the film. Themes such as light adventure and ""puppy love"" were well presented in the film. LOL. To me, the ending of the movie was quite exhilarating. I engrossed in the film towards the end, maybe even more than I would be while watching an action packed film such as Avatar.",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
102,israeljohn-648-517263,Simply enthralling rodent fun,9,1 April 2013,"These cheeky chipmunks just cannot stay out of trouble! This time, the three fellas (Alv, Si and Theo) come up against 3 steaming chipmunks (check it) known as the Chippetes. In order to win the battle of the bands, they have to up their game and give the performance of their wild lives. I will not lie to you: it's a very, very tense movie. I was on the edge of my seat when Alvin stepped up to the mic for the last song. I was thinking to myself 'Alvin and co! You only get one shot! Do not miss your chance to blow! This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo!' I won't ruin the ending for you all, but let's just say we could well be expecting a new litter of chipmunks in the future (if you catch my drift...)Information about chipmunks: http://chirpiechipmunkz.webs.com/aboutchipmunks.htmMy rating - 9/10. Would have given it 10 but unfortunately it only lasted for 88 minutes and as you can imagine, was left wanting much much more. We want trilogy! We want trilogy!HH",Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Squeakquel
