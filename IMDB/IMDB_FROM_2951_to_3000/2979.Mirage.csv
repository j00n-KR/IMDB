0,kosmasp,Do you,7,25 November 2020,"You do you ... and do someone else too. But would you know you did you and someone else, if you did do? And what about the other things you did do, but don't remember doing? Wait does that make sense? I think it does, but does it? Now if you try to deconstruct what is happening here and how the timelines work with each other ... although do they? The end does suggest that ... well that's a subject for later.The thriller mystery aspect of the movie is quite nicely told and unfolds at a decent pace ... may be a bit too slow for some, but that is something you have to account for. The acting is good overall, even when you feel like there are things you are more aware of than the main character. How do you convince others you are not crazy with a crazy theory? Which is putting it mildly.The end ... well let's just say that the movie puts a nice bow to it all in a way ... or maybe not! One thing is for sure, I wanted it to go another way. Because who would know? Seems like someone would ... although they shouldn't ... because how can they? Again ... it's mind bending and twisting in a way that can not be explained ... or rather isn't explained, plain and (not) simple",Mirage
1,Sleepin_Dragon,What a brilliant movie.,9,23 March 2019,"I was getting ready to switch off, as I struggle with dubbed films, but after a few minutes I was gripped, even with the dubbed voices. The story was fantastic, very original, very intelligent, finally a film where the audience weren't treated as idiots. The acting was superb, the production values terrific, all helped to drive home the layered and comes story.It had me questioning the whole way through, and left me guessing right until the end. This is one impressive movie. 9/10",Mirage
2,deloudelouvain,One of the better Spanish movies.,8,22 November 2019,"Durante La Tormenta (Mirage) is one of the better Spanish movies I watched lately. The least you could say is that Oriol Paulo has a very broad imagination as the story isn't the usual stuff we get. There are enough twists and turns to keep your attention during the entire running time of this movie. The high mystery level is what makes this movie different, you can't help yourself imagining all possible outcomes. Adriana Ugarte as the main character Vera Roy did an excellent job, as well as the rest of the cast. Durante La Tormenta has it all for me, good actors and a great intriguing storyline, everything I needed for an excellent movie night.",Mirage

4,wandernn1-81-683274,It Was Okay,5,23 April 2021,Another lost kid / time travel film. I feel like I'd seen it before. So it's only going to get a 5/10 from me.,Mirage
5,cjonesas,[8.8] The course of two lives through the storm of destiny,9,1 August 2021,"An awesome movie, again by the amazing Oriol Paulo that combines mystery, fantasy and drama in a seamless way, grabbing your attention from the first minutes up until the very end.It is (so) complex in its screenplay, with meticulous attention to filming details, camera work and filming speed, combined with very good acting and a befitting score frighteningly accompanying the events and scenes.IMO, everything is well done, besides some flaws in logic and a way convenient and emotional ending. Had the ending been less sort of predictable and more brutal, it could have been more fit and contributed more to the dramatic flow of the movie.That's a movie very complex in structure with spatial timelines superposing and generating sparks in parallel at the same time, like facets of a well-cut diamond under the light, turning and glowing with multiple colors, having the green, blue and red mixing in shades of magenta, orange, purple and turquoise-emerald, like the main character's love life that's shown mostly, somewhat intertwined with her more neglected professional one, in pictures and through time-space ""flashbacks"".It's a story of love, loss and betrayal told through a bizarre storm occurring two times in a period of 25 years, creating a space warp in the continuum of two separate lives juxtaposed over each other, while trying at the same time to save and find each other.A movie well worth watching having the same touch and profoundness of other Paulo Oriol works in the field of mystery and drama with the addition this time of loads of fantastic fantasy sewn into the multi-faceted layers of the storyline. One of a kind both as a deeply enthralling movie as well as representing the groundbreaking and unique director/writer that he is and deservedly famous for the depth of his creations among his appreciative fans.Screenplay/story: 9Direction/development: 9Realism: 9Entertainment: 9.5Acting: 9Cinematography/filming: 9.2Visuals/special effects: 9Music/score: 8.5Depth: 9.4Logic: 7Flow: 9Fantasy/mystery: 9.5Ending: 8.",Mirage

7,ulicknormanowen,Riders on the storm.,8,8 April 2021,"An absorbing story of time warp ,during a storm ( hence the title) ; the communication ,through an old TV set ,of a boy of the late eighties ( the fall of the wall of Berlin was a good choice ,for , to many people ,it means the end of the twentieth century ) and a contemporary woman ;and a harrowing dilemma: if she prevents the boy from being run over by a car ,little did she know that her whole life would be changed ,the worse being the loss of her daughter who becomes the girl that never was; add a murder mystery and you've got a gripping thriller , well acted, which sustains the interest till the very end .I'd tone things down a bit nevertheless: it borrows perhaps too much from another excellent Spanish film ""abre los ojos"" (1997) which came aside as a shock at the time ;in spite of its unqualified brilliance, there's some ""déjà vu"" in "" durante la tormenta"" .",Mirage

9,Amyth47,Unconventional time-travel story - kinda silly but good silly.,8,15 January 2021,"My Rating : 8/10I loved 'Invisible Guest' and of course who doesn't love the Professor! So here's a great combination of both director and actor and it's a great outcome overall.It's got that typical spanish feel to it that all thrillers from here are known for - time-travel, revenge, romance, puzzled storyline - it's all here and while it's farfetched silly and fantasy-like it's worthy of viewing.If you like mystery, thriller and time-travel 'Mirage' will do just the trick!",Mirage
10,Luigi Di Pilla,Great mystery thriller from Spain,7,10 April 2019,"Director Oriol Paulo did a great job and all actors delivered perfect roles for each character. The story is complex but well executed in their details. It's like Frequency but here you see on the other side the real persons. It works in the same time as a thriller were justice will win finally. I had even tears at the end.
I can recommend it to every one who likes intriguing films and loves movies of Hitchcock. My wife gave 4/10 but I 10/10 so the final score is 7/10.
Don't miss it.",Mirage

After the change, there are only 72 hours to find a way to reverse things.This is a well thought out film. The story is written in a way that keeps you hungering for answers. The actors played their parts well and that pulls the viewer in as well.My only complaint has to do with the ending. I wanted to see more of the consequences in the aftermath of all that happened. It was a good film regardless. Glad I checked it out.",Mirage
13,MR_Heraclius,Mirage,10,12 February 2020,"I wasn't expecting this film to be so good. It's an understated thriller with a very good plot that keeps you wondering what will happen till the end.

16,muamba_eats_toast,Interesting Sci-fi mystery that keeps twisting and turning,8,30 July 2019,In a film industry so over saturated with rip off and remakes it was refreshing to see something so refreshingly original even if it was a Netflix special. Whilst at times it was a little predictable there was enough other twists along with a great general premise and some great performances to make this more than worthwhile and a thoroughly entertaining time despite its occasional flaws. Well worth a watch.,Mirage
17,Aktham_Tashtush,Oriol Paulo should have more worldwide recognition,8,24 March 2019,"This is the 3rd movie i watch for the Catalan director, and man did he deliver another masterpiece.The plot is genius and most importantly ""current"" coping with this age and so original. The script itself was tight and connected ,, and even thought it was a bit slow in the beginning but turns so helpful to clear things up before introducing the ""time lines change"" idea.The cast were all perfect ,, from the lead Adriana Ugarte to Álvaro Morte (the guy from the Netflix show money heist) and Chino Darín and even the kid was really good.Netflix knows where to invest ,, the other day i read that Steven Spielberg attacking Netflix that they shouldn't be on the Oscars and so on (After they won three Oscars for Roma by Alfonso Cuarón) .. My say in this was ... ""The future is now old man"" , Netflix knows whats worth spending money on ,, and they harvest what they planted.",Mirage

I can feel it in my bones that an American remake is probably in the works. Hopefully, they won't ruin the tension created in this original. This is one of the best films I've seen in months and is definitely recommended.",Mirage
19,abisio,VERY SMART SCRIPT BUT TOO SLOW FOR ITS OWN GOOD,6,28 March 2019,"There a lot of very interesting ideas about time travel in MIRAGE (Durante la tormenta); the problem is that the movie overstay its welcome and the great moments get buried on the languid pace and far acting.
Adriana Ugarte is usually good but here her acting is unable to transmit real emotion. Chino Darin does not help and the rest of the cast is pretty contained.
The movie plays with the concept of establishing a connection with the past under an spectacular storm.Without a lot of detail, she connects with a kid 25 years in the past and saves his life; however her present completely changes. There are a lot of implausibilities in the script; but suspending your disbelief allow few of unexpected twists.
Sadly, an unnecessary adjustment of the ending; ruins what could have been a very logical ending.In brief; it is not a totally bad movie and it is obvious that the feelings / drama are more important than the thriller or sci-fictions concepts but it really test your patience",Mirage
20,SameirAli,Very Interesting.,8,28 August 2021,"Very interesting movie. It looks like the film makers are very much influenced by the Back to the Future. The greatest 2 twists were purely predictable through the obvious scenes and reactions, but the ending was not predicted, that had a crash landing. Must watch for those who like mystery, fantasy films.",Mirage
21,DogePelis2015,During the storm,8,19 September 2021,It is the best Spanish film that I have seen in my life; the plot is very original and the performances of Adriana Ugarte and Chino Darín are excellent; Oriol Paulo is a very good director.,Mirage
22,Stanlee107,Butterfly effect,7,19 September 2020,"First of all I'm pleased to have watched this film dubbed in English. This film explores the butterfly effect like the film with the same namesake. It is an amalgamation of time travel concepts that was made famous from Back to the Future with the notion that any change made in the past can lead to a new time line being created...There is a film called Frequency in which a person is able to communicate with someone from the past via an old fashioned Cv radio. This film uses a newer medium: the 1980s television and a camcorder.A woman inadvertently communicates with boy, via this 1980s television & camcorder, that died 25 years ago after stumbling upon a neighbour whose wife is murdered. She convinces him to not go to the neighbor that night and the result of which is that his life is spared & her life changed from the one she had & knew. This is the Butterfly Effect of her action.This film takes an interesting concept & goes with it full throttle. The protagonist does a good job at conveying the shock of living in a different time line and gradually piecing together a new Jigsaw. She refuses to accept the reality of this new time line & tries to replicate the conditions in which she may be able to change the past to the future of her previous time line.It is more like the twelve monkeys than Back to the future in its bleakness but perhaps with a glimmer of hope at the end. It is very watchable.",Mirage
23,mjsreg,Excellent,7,27 October 2019,"This is an engaging and intricate story told in a contemporary context where you really never know where it's going until the very end.The production and acting are brilliant.There really isn't much to say without spoiling the movie, except this is another very good production coming from Spanish cinema.",Mirage
24,FrenchEddieFelson,Twilight Zone in Barcelona,7,23 March 2019,"Being excessively binary, either you are ultra-rational and you will probably feel that this story is far-fetched, either you have a strong appetite for the 'Twilight Zone' atmospheres, and you should love this movie. If I have to be categorized, I clearly belong to the second category: I liked this story which establishes a literally extra-ordinary connection between Nico (a 12-year-old kid living in 1989) and Vera (a 30-year-old mother living in 2014), thanks to a vhs recorder and an unconventional storm. Thus, the mother prevents the death, 25 years earlier, of this teenager which implies the passage from one space-time to another: a complete new life for her, without her daughter but with the full memory of the ancient life, especially her daughter, now nonexistent. What a nightmare! But, she definitely wants her ancient life back.These are the first 15 minutes.
The continuation is to be discovered and enjoyed !",Mirage
25,lathe-of-heaven,"WOW! Just, Wow... My review is completely unnecessary since there are so many good ones here, but this movie is extremely well made and packs a good punch... Blu-ray: A:9 V:8",9,9 March 2020,"Okay... My review is truly not needed and I normally don't write one when there are so many good ones already, but I was SO damn impressed with this film I just had to come here and at least say that.This guy... and, I mean this director... IS indeed the next M. Night... PERIOD! If you not only really like serious Sci Fi but you appreciate movies that are extremely well made and put together, AND you like a very good twist or 2 or 3, then you will probably really like this one. Honestly, that is all I need to say...Just to clarify, this isn't the big effects driven Space Opera 'STAR WARS' or 'TERMINATOR' Sci fi, although there is certainly absolutely nothing wrong with those types. BUT... for those who are hard core 'serious' Science Fiction lovers from the standpoint of a really good, intriguing, and sold story, then this film will most definitely do it for you.That's about it. It might fool you at the beginning and you might think, 'Oh, this is just one of ""THOSE"" Science Fiction films', but no... It gets better, I promise you... Truthfully, part of the answer briefly crossed my mind early on, but the culmination of the story and the way it was done still basically blew my nutz off (I got better...) Despite 'guessing' a part of it, there were still a couple of additional powerful, completely unexpected surprises in store.I gave it a '9' which FWIW I do not do often, but this guy, this director is TRULY amazing, hands down! I don't normally end my little reviews so strongly, but you need to see this...",Mirage

Well written, acted, and directed. Ending is a bit rushed, but it works: I just wanted more there. But I thoroughly enjoyed Mirage. Many International Films as good as this one are challenging the American market and often surpassing. Highly recommended.",Mirage
27,shashrvacai,Good film,6,19 December 2020,"Good film, but a bit confused about the actor choices .. it's not exactly a time travel film. More of time communication film.",Mirage
28,quaseprovisorio,a better concept but the same gimmicks and twists again,7,26 April 2020,"Well oriol paulo does some stuff right: othwerwise i wouldnt have seen three movies of him in the last weeks. el cuerpo and contratiempo are very similar films, with mostly one spot where everything happens, and then a bunch of twists more or less predictable and sometimes too far-fetched. this movie, even though it reminded me ""frequency"" a lot has a better set pieces and a nicer mystery to unfold. the problem is the same of his other movies: believing the twist is the most important thing - and the twist here is the worse and completely unnecessary.first: i like how we need to unfold the whole thing. we can understand the drama of the woman living in a different timeline, because something had changed and now she has no daughter. that's a cool thing. the unsolved murder is also interesting, because it is given in different perspectives. the main problem are two:first the author character sucks. for someone who wrote a book on that subject she knows very very little. but worse is when we know who the 12 year old boy in 1989 is now. Him being the policeman is ridiculous. first, even if the movie is set in 2014 the guy must have been born in 1977 to be 12 in 1989. So in 2014 he had to be 37 years old. We can believe that guy is 37 but it's not very believable. i hated that twist also because it was very predictable and requires too much suspension of disbelief.i think oriol paulo has again cool stuff going here: good atmosphere, the characters are better than previous films, i think this mystery has better things to unfold. The problem again is the eagerness to surprise the viewer and, if you're not new to his films, the surprise is nothing special. i wish he wouldn't focus so much on have a twist ending, because it kinda ruins this film.anyway i enjoyed it. but i would like something new and fresh. he tried but didn't totally deliver.",Mirage
29,isantistao,Best Alternate Reality Movie Ever,10,25 July 2020,"This is definitely the best alternate reality movie ever. It is sorta like a time travel movie too and would rate high up among time travel movies as well. It also combines some elements of murder mystery. And it is very dramatic and brought tears to my eyes a few times. It is an absolutely amazing story, incredibly intricate and complex, yet well told enough to not be confusing. The storytelling is stunningly beautiful, and the other film making elements are as well. This is among one of my favorite movies, and is a must see for anyone who enjoys thought provoking films.",Mirage
30,Insane_Man,A very good one but not perfect,7,17 June 2019,"***May be spoiler a little bit! But not the main shock.***
It is obviously a good movie, from a talented director. It's almost a sci-fi genre movie. Thus it's a good movie but not perfect. Director emphasized on the main focus ""parallel/alternative story telling"" but missed some less important facts. Example the dog bark at the intruder but not the dead body into the car. The twist is very predictable. The ending is good and enjoyable but not a shock. If anyone miss a scene he/she will miss a important element to join the puzzles. So don't miss any scene, you will definitely enjoy.",Mirage
31,Mivas_Greece,Another great masterpiece from Spanish cinema! Perhaps the best movie based on the Butterfly Effect. Recommended to everyone!,8,26 April 2021,"Mystery/fiction film from Spain. One of the pioneering films based on the idea of the butterfly phenomenon, on which the ""Butterfly Effect"" trilogy was based. So somehow for a very short time someone can make contact with the past and if they choose not to just be an observer but to change something small, this little one can radically change too many things in the future. Thus, the protagonist discovers that during a particular storm she can receive and broadcast in the past via an analog TV and her connected camera. But if she chooses to change something that happened 25 years ago, she will find that this will change everything in her own life and find herself in a life that she does not remember, but remembers the life she lost because of that change. When she discovers the whole truth she will have to make an important decision that will change both her past and her future, it all depends on what she does with the connection in the past. Excellent script that unfolds gradually with reveals and twists to the viewer, very good acting and direction, and unlike the American Butterfly Effect trilogy, it is a serious and well-filmed movie, another masterpiece from the very good Spanish cinema, perhaps the best in all of Europe and one of the best in general. Recommended to everyone!",Mirage

33,compugor,Captivating Convolution,7,23 March 2019,"Reading the captions in English and hearing the dialog in Spanish is a challenge while your eyes want to stay riveted on the attractive lead actress; and any distraction makes the whole thing confusing.

34,manugw,If Sigmund Freud were alive..,7,13 April 2019,"A space-time wormhole opens during two similar storms ocurring back in 1989 and the present, this alters the course of a life of a woman who then becomes aware by chance of a crime in her neighborhood in the past. At the beginning everything looks too flabby and confusing until a big twist turns everything over. It is difficult to place this film in the science fiction, phychological thriller or crime story types as it has elements extracted from all of them. (Sherlock Holmes blended with Back to the Future). Was all originated in a nightmare of this woman?, perhaps, but simple coincidences made out of concrete things say maybe not. Overall, it is not a boring film, but often becomes difficult to follow, as from the beginning the rational mind of the viewer has to adjust to the comprehension of a myriad of irrational events from different space - times popping up at a fast pace.",Mirage
35,thor2029,Between the unreal and the real,9,10 July 2020,"Mirage - is another excellent production of: Oriol Paulo, who already has other excellent movies to his credit, among others: the eyes of Julia (2010), El Corpo (2012), and The accused (2016), not to quote them, so already excellent achievements that have had excellent reviews.Here with - Mirage - he was able to create a sustained atmosphere in the various recognized genres of the film: dramatic, mysterious, fantastic thriller and also moments marked with romance, all in perfect balance, because even the script born weakens at no time in the inconsistency, everything comes together and there is a beginning and an end, which is not always the case in this kind of multifaceted movie. The realization is neat, the photography also and finally the interpreters are in perfect adequacy with the projection of the movie. Note the perfect performance of: ""Adriana Ugarte"" in the role of (Vera Roy) she gives a lot of strength to her character and makes it even more credible despite the fantastic aspect of the plot. As always, an excellent director, with an excellent script and valuable performers make their productions even stronger, as was the case here with Mirage.

I can only think all the low score reviews are from people that are extremely difficult to please. They all seemed to watch it through to the end though so it can't have been that bad for them.

Great filmmaking and story telling.A new take on time travel anomalies and you care about the characters.My only criticism is it is too short and the pacing is speeded up 2/3rds of the way through, to tie up the stories loose ends.",Mirage
45,tariqzafar-12020,Mind bending.,10,19 April 2020,The concept of time travel is always intriguing. I watched Primer and its a fine example of how complex it could be to twist this concept into mind boggling stories. I don't wanna give out spoilers about the movie but if you just watch casually without any attention you might just not understand fully what is happening. There are three timelines going on and some mish-mash of facts from one timeline to the other. Reminded me of the tv series Dark which was equally intriguing. I loved this movie.,Mirage

The script is good, no black and white characters here, and you might be left thinking about some of the morals even long after the movie is over. The pacing is on par, not as fast as in his other movies, but never boring.The actors are all great, with a standout performance from the child actor, and although you do need to suspend disbelief with some characters' behaviour and some coincidences, you should check your cynicism at the door anyway when watching a movie about people 30 years apart talking through the television.",Mirage

Once again it is confirmed that Oriol Paulo is one of the best directors of today. Usually under the radar, the director's job has always been emotionally perfect. We must appreciate more the art of the Catalan director, that art that takes risks, that likes to create stories that are difficult to understand and that break with the established norm. In short, a very well directed film, and with very good actors. Javier Gutiérrez, although with a very limited time in this film, continues to demonstrate why he is one of the best Spanish actors of today. Without a doubt, few directors are able to unite a love story in this way. What a piece of director, that once again, leaves me stunned.",Mirage

However, after watching the invisible guest and the body , i was watching this movie and i got the feeling that it is pretty much the same scenario taking place just with a different story, so in moment i was ready for a plot twist and actually i speculated that the detective is nico at some point , so i wasn't as surprised as i was when i watched the invisible guest cause i knew this director follow the same steps in all his movies , build up a mysterious story then hits you with the truth , but still enjoyable to watch and i give it 8,5 , i also wanted to point that the detective Nico was the only one that i didn't like in this movie , he acting was poor to be honest , he was crucial to the story but when you see his reactions you don't feel that he is doing a great job , he was so cold",Mirage

Compared to German, Italian i havent seen much spanish movies. However, Oriol Paul's Invisible guest, and the body was remade and destroyed in Hindi, hence i watched the originals. Oriol got a strong sense of how deep the movie story should be.Mirage is written by the director himself,
So the story is so deep and complicated that if you miss 5 minutes of the movie, the entire story will become foggy.Its a time travel, mystery, path changing movie hence the roles, flow wil change like a flow chart.It feels really complicated at the beginning but slowly it pulls us into the world of Vera Roy - acted by Adriana Ugarte, She is just awesome in this.It is in Netflix, hence watch it if you like Time Travel, Sci fi Mystery thrillers.8/10",Mirage

61,heykateforever,A Twist of A Love Story Not To Be Missed,10,26 March 2019,"I haven't read any other reviews in here because I really didn't care what others thought about this movie. I am still in tears after watching this absolutely stunning Spanish movie, Mirage. I don't watch a lot of Netflix because most of it is garbage for those in the 25 and under set, but the headline on this one intrigued me. My eyes aren't very good, so unfortunately, I had to watch the English dubbed version which I know isn't the best way to watch a movie and why I rated it a rare ten.The movie is built much as the British and Finish movies - slow to start, unfolding the layers little by little. For a person with a short attention span, you might want to pass this one by. But if you enjoy a well told tale, filled with some mysterious, sci fi twists, time travel, and, yes, a beautiful love story, with an absolutely stunning surprise of an ending, this one is for you. This movie, IMHO, was almost the perfect movie. Something I have not seen in a very long time. I LIVED inside of this tale as it slowly but steadily moved toward the ending I was hoping for. It checked all my boxes for a movie, something I almost never see.The cinematography was excellent. The actors were superb. I have never seen these actors before because this is the first Spanish film I have been interested in seeing. Each actor played their part with an excellence I have rarely seen in modern days. A special shout out to the young boy who plays Nico and the older man who plays the grown up Nico, and the actress who plays Vera Roy. But the best part, without ruining it for anyone who reads this? Was the love story that grows from the very first few scenes until the perfect ending. I would say this is almost a classic Chick Flick, except I suspect my husband will love this one, too. It has just enough action, mystery, sci fi, wrapped around the love story that it will appeal to many men as well. Two thumbs up to the director, Oriol Paulo, for crafting this fine story, getting the best out of the actors, and making only one mistake that I caught, but that was in the very beginning - there might have been more, but so absorbed into this wonderful story was I, I probably missed the rest.Highly recommended watching. A rare commodity on Netflix which has been loaded up with silly (but some good - Ricky Gervais and Idris Elba both have very funny 30 minute comedies recently added) comedies and super hero seasons and movies and witchy stuff I am uninterested in. Definitely several steps above the usual fare offered by Netflix. One of the finest love stories I have seen in many years! Put it in your must-see list! You won't be disappointed!",Mirage
62,Rifat_Rock_Don,Best Masterpiece Spanish Movie 😍😍,10,7 July 2020,"One of the best movie I've watched in a long time I love how Oriol Paulo took a concept that has been exploited over and over but found a way to revamp it and tell a fascinating story.

It's well worth the watch I wish I'd of seen it earlier instead of writing it off because it was in Spanish I never knew it was English dubbed anyway just watch it you will enjoy it.

This is a very entertaining movie but somehow certain elements failed to hold the surprise element. Space Time continuum has been explored before but this movie added a emotional angle to it.
The lead actress is good but cant say same for the guy who played the cop.Still I am very interested in watching more movies by this director. But he needs to get a stellar cast like ""invisible Guest"" and screenplay for the magic to work again.",Mirage
69,daretoreadme,Perfect! - Daretoreadme,10,13 July 2021,"13th July 2021,
NetflixI'm so glad that I finally decided to watch Mirage, since it was in my watchlist for years. I thought it as some kind of complex time warp like Dark (2017), but after watching it, I should tell you, it's incredible.It's emotional, thought provoking and, logical - which is the most important aspect that any sci-fi film should possess. What I love about the film is that it didn't dwell too much on the preface and gave us all little details (that are very important) within few shots and went directly to the major part of the story.The screenplay is really focused on the important theme on which the film revolves around and that, phenomenally works out. The sense of mystery, the unexpected love, it emphases on, the motive and vision of individual characters, is all fine tuned to be perfectly fitting in.There's nothing I could say anymore for, this review to be a non-spoiler, but I really really recommend this. This is going on to my favorite films of all time list and is going to stay there forever.With all love,

70,stephenherman,Impressive unique concept on time travel,10,2 June 2020,Impressive and well thought out. There's no physical time travel in it. No one's moving through time.

It is difficult to explain why I disliked the Ending of movie so much without divulging the story...So let me just say that, while director Oriol Paulo did a great job in building a great fantasy and mystery in the movie, he chickened out in the end and chose a weaker ending, showcasing that either humans (and I am pressed to say here a woman) just can't live with what is more stronger version of themselves...that we can't let go of the past even when we realize that it doesn't have that much value and that we are mere puppets in the hands of fate like some sentimental fools!No we are NOT, many of us have made tougher choices in life and come out stronger on the other side.

In fact, a very entertaining and satirical campy thriller can be produced with this material. Instead, this film deals with it with extreme serious handling, emotional turmoil and one coincidence after another. It is a pity - the plot twists are clever but never leave the desired impact because the viewers can easily spot the film's fascination with unexplained coincidences. Coincidences are fine in a comedic material, but not in a movie that attempts to preach about family, loyalty, love, potential, ambition, politics - such heavy-handed topics in a straight face.",Mirage

It would've made sense if the film continued from Nico's POV and how his life has changed after he spoke to his younger self through the television. Actually this will keep going on as a loop but still to end this in style it could've been Nico checking on Vera in the present reality and feel happy for her to be united back with her child Gloria. What should've been a good time travel movie became an average movie that was totally spoiled by the climax.

102,hollandvillage,Too many twists and turns to the plot makes the movie convoluted,7,3 June 2019,"The director/witer to this movie has been one of my favourites so far. I have seen his 2016 movie entitled, 'The Invisible Guest' & 2010 movie entitled. 'Julia Eyes' & I really like both movies. Somehow, he has a flair of creating thriller suspense movies with multiple layers to the characters & story lines as such. As a viewer, you really do not know what you are getting, until you sat through the entire movie.However in my opinion for this movie, there are just too many twists and turns to the story line, making the entire movie sometimes convoluted & a little messy. Some of the added twists in the movie are just really unnecessary & the viewers watching the movie really has to sit through the entire movie & pay close attention to the story line, as the movie unfolds. Else they might get lost or even sidetracked in the story plot.That being said, I still feel that this movie makes a pretty decent suspense thriller, thus me giving it a 7 stars rating for my review. Perhaps a suggestion for the same group of writers, creating similar future movie genre, to tone down on the telenovela aspect of their movie plot (so to speak), making these movies more plausible for the audience.

It pretty much plays to its own rules with its time travel concept and for the most part respects and follows them. Performance are pretty decent if unexceptional but it's let down by its pacing a little. So it's not a bad effort in general. Having said that there is one small nit-pick I have with it. It's final scene. As I said above for the most part it follows its own rules quite well and pretty much sticks to its internal TT logic. However, the final scene breaks this logic and let's it down a touch. This may leave the real TT film fans with an unwanted wrinkle that may annoy them.",Mirage

106,JJthebat,Above average,5,8 April 2020,"You could say this film is a sort of more mystery/romantic take on a story like Back To The Future or the Butterfly Effect in spanish. And for what it's worth i enjoyed it overall, even if it's not something very special.The actors did a good job portraying all of their characters and the film is always entertaining to some level. The directing is very profesional and well done, particularly i liked the use of lighting in the film (the color blue can sometimes be too much, but it looked really nice), and it can be quite fun to watch this whole mystery unravel, even if it's not very surprising.It can sometimes feel very cheesy and overdramatic however, which can hurt the tension of the film. And the twist of the film is really predictable and kinda dumb. As soon as I saw the Leira character helping our protagonist without explicitly telling her who he was, which was around 15 min into the film, I knew exactly how it was going to end and the character's motivations (maybe not his romantic motivations, but you get what i mean, right?)Also some of the sound choices during the ""murder"" scene felt very derivative, but I guess it's not that big of a deal.Some people will really enjoy this movie or at least like it fine (like me), so i guess go watch it if your interested.

120,roshanin-81205,Excellently written crime mystery story utilising a time travel edge to make it even more engrossing,9,6 July 2019,"I was looking for an intelligent film with a principally science fiction driven plot when I stumbled across this gem. But you don't have to be a sci fi obsessive to enjoy this.The good:
Intelligent and gripping plot
Well paced
Decent acting
One of the better and more consistent time travel plotsThe bad:
Some parts are drawn out. Might have been better as a two/three part mini series
Personally I can think of endings I'd prefer...Less cutesy, more realistic.The premise is the the main character, a lady who is a mother and neurosurgeon, has accidentally found a way to communicate to a boy in the past to prevent a tragedy he is involved in. When the consequences catch up with her, she is is confused. As she tries to put herself back in her original life she finds everyone she knew has a different memory to hers. Worst of all, her daughter seems to have never existed.As someone who has only a schoolchild's grasp of Spanish I can say the subtitled version of the film was enough to keep me hooked on every plot detail, relate to and question the characters and wonder what I might feel in the main character's shoes.If you want a thought provoking, fairly intelligent thriller then this is a very good one.",Mirage
121,callalily-61774,Best movie I've seen in a long time,10,26 March 2019,"Short: watch it.
Long: I am so glad to not have to write a negative review for once. I feel like I've watched a string of terrible movies, and I was beginning to think that I'm just not a movie person, but this proved me wrong.
This movie is pretty much perfect, except it could have been just a bit longer, which is crazy to say because it's already a long movie. There was a particular confrontation I would have liked to have seen play out, and more of the reunion.
And where the length is concerned for once it wasn't a case of boring, boring, boring, then a sudden rushed ending with a plot twist that is so twisty that it feels like a ploy, and not the logical conclusion. This had a twist, and not just for the twist sake, and it still led to a logical conclusion. It can be done!
The plot was somewhat complicated, but there was nothing that I felt could have, or should have, been cut. It was all necessary. I feel like so many movies I watch start plot lines and then seem to just forget about them, but with this movie, I'd think, 'but what about...' and that would be the next scene. It was a tight plot.
Perfect ending, what you want, without it being overly contrived, and not what you thought you wanted for most of the movie. You can have your cake and eat it too, and not feel like it's merely a guilty pleasure. The MC gets everything she wanted in the end, it's all wrapped up, but not without heartbreak and complication on the horizon. It makes it feel more like reality, despite it being anything but.
And it was the perfect impossible choice. But as any mother knows, it may have been hard, but in the end there was really no choice at all.",Mirage

124,victormonticelli,2 hours wasted,3,21 April 2020,"I think that the concept behind the movie is interesting, but the main problem here is the writing. There's way too many plotholes, and way too much romance and drama forced into the story about halfway through.I was kind of enjoying it despite it inconsistencies but since the moment that Vera discovers that the cop was in fact Nico it went downhill very fast. It feels like everything turned into a series of very cheap and unbelieavable plot twists, melodrama and conveniences until a laughable ""happy end"". Plus, that scene where Vera jumps from the building with open arms in slow motion is so obnoxious... just why?",Mirage

The only thing lacking was a proper closure, which it fell short of. Admire the taste of the writer/director Oriol Paulo. Not a bad attempt at all!

132,CineCineCineCine,Really solid time travel movie,9,6 July 2021,"I'm a huge fan of time travel movies and series, so, being Spanish I'm really proud of this little gem of a film which, with a modest budget, provides a really satisfying experience with a thoroughly well-thought script that leaves just a couple of plot holes. Adriana Ugarte, Chino Darín, Álvaro Morte and the boy are all outstanding.SPOILER ALERTThe main plot hole I can see is that the Spanish police would never accept somebody with such a heavy psychiatrist past as Nico. Although maybe in a 2nd viewing it could be shown that in adult Nico's first life he wasn't in the police after all, I'm not sure if this is just an assumption by the viewer; he could be some kind of external advisor or just the next of kin the police contacted to be with Vera (which then wouldn't explain why he was present in the questioning of the murderous couple). Of course, in his 2nd adult life he wouldn't have had psychiatric problems, after having been advised by his adult self to forget Vera, so it's believable his being a police agent. Plus of course the name of Nico is mentioned very early on in the investigation, and nobody says to Vera who he is. I might watch again that part to see if there is a way to explain this.Another rather difficult twist to believe is that the child Nico would have been allowed to go day after day for years to wait at the tube station till he finally met adult Vera.Somebody in a comment highlights a couple of questionable topics which they leave for people in the same country to answer, so here is my contribution:The child is a lonely boy whose mother works night shifts, so he's probably quite used to being alone and thus quite adventurous, so it's not entirely unbelievable that he goes next door to see what's happening.The impersonation at the airport happens with a forged passport with the photo ID of the woman leaving the country, so, as was the case back then and now, it only requires from the steward a quick glance at the document to see it matches with then name in the ticket and the person boarding the plane. Besides, in this case the security person was the woman's brother who was helping her escape.All in all, a really enjoyable experience.",Mirage

She finds out that a boy who used to live there witnessed a murder and was run over by a car as he ran from the scene of the crime. During a violent thunderstorm, Vera gets connected with the boy's reality 25 years earlier through an old TV set, and convinces him that he shouldn't go to the house where the murder takes place, thus saving his life.

Be it the story, direction or writing. And it involves time-travel. I have a science background and am aware of the current physics theories for time-travel. This movie practically throws all those theories and logic out of the window!Still, this movie had me on the edge of my seat every single second. It takes you through a thrilling ride right from the start till the last mind blowing scene. It shows how a single small event changes the life of a person drastically (butterfly effect). I rate this movie just for the adrenaline rush alone.Before I watched it, a friend told me to not be a critical analyser that I am and watch the movie as pure fiction. An important recommendation is to watch it with subtitles in Spanish only, and not the dubbed version which I tried for a few minutes and it's horrible.",Mirage

151,moviegonewrong,Romance parallel universe movie that's quite annoying,4,24 March 2019,"The movie would have been an easy 6/10 if it wasn't the main character - Vera Roy.Vera Roy is the most annoying character in the movie. Sure, she wakes up in another universe and things changed. That is confusing to everyone at first. But, after she realized she changed the boy decision, she should have understood that everything changed and people in the new universe do not share the same memory anymore. So, WHY she keeps talking to people as if they should have remembered the same things as she does in another universe? when people don't share the same memory as she does, she gets mad and agitated. Funny enough, the movie suggests that she is trying to be a surgeon and studying at a med school. As a normal person, I would expect people study science/medical degree would have good logical sense.The second problem of this movie is the cause/starting point of the whole event - the boy goes to the neighbor's house during violent event happening. A boy sees and hears violent event going on in the neighbor's home. Instead of calling Mum/police/friends or just staying home, he decides to go check out what's going on by going out of his home and going into his neighbor's home. I highly doubt even an adult would do the same unless he/she works in law enforcement. What is he expecting to find? the neighbors are preparing an act for a new show in town? Santa Claus comes earlier than expect and stumble in his neighbor's home? Harry Porter practices magic at home and it goes wrong?One plot I can think of that is perhaps hidden in the movie is that:
1. The boy actually sees a future person from the TV before all this happen
2. The future person told the boy YouTuber is huge in the future and they make a lot of money
3. The boy got the idea and tried to become the first YouTuber in his age
4. He recorded everything on tape, but realized the internet wasn't really there yet
5. All the time he was actually frustrated about how he can post his video online and get likes without the help of YouTube or social media

Yes you read it correct. Without any doubts, just watch this movie. It's truly awesome. This time I saw the same concept. I thought there'll be paradox in it. But it's not. I thought I would give it 9 stars because the plot was easy to guess and the suspense was not that much. You'll easily guess who 'Nico' is. 'Nico' - there's character named in it. But trust you'll never get bored. In fact your curiousness will get high and high after star watching it. Honestly I can't tell the director how thankful I'm to watch this movie.

She cannot except that the reality is changed and that goes on through the whole movie with her crying and constantly having a tormented face expression. But the most iritating part is the beggining when a small boy goes to investigate the racket in the neighbour's house. Who would ever do that?!?

Liked the look, the color and texture transport you to a really rainy day, I needed a blanket and be cozy. I loved how they show you the worst images, things very morbid. And the story line its pretty cool,they count you two stories in like two hours.

About the sound design, I don't have much to say, but I liked how they bring the storm in the sound.

This film is very well made, and I found the entire story and the acting to be beautiful.One of the toughest things about making a movie is to avoid the cliches and make it less predictable. This movie achieves that perfectly. There are many twists compared to the average mystery sci-fi but none forced to an extent that fatigues the mind.

I started watching it at about 11 pm and its 2 hours and nine minutes got me caught up!I might be a little biased since I'm a sucker for murder/crime movies and Tv shows and also for anything time travel/parallel universe related. This had everything to me.The tension of changing something in the past and altering everything in one's future and not knowing how it's gonna turn out in the end is just so good in this one. The characters were really convincing, even though you only understand them better after a while. Something's are not credible, like how fast a crime investigation from 20 years ago is, but hey, it's a time travel movie, it's poetic licence. It's really about a mother's love to her daughter and it's done very well.Also, I'm a huge Back to the Future fan (who isn't?) and my heart warmed a bit after seeing details like the vests over jeans jackets, the skate that resembles a hoverboard and the lightening striking the clock at the school's ""tower"".The end was good for me, even though I had already discovered the biggest ""secret"" in the middle of it, but I won't spoil it for you! Go watch it! (In original audio + subtitles please!)",Mirage
180,paddyaugust,Brilliant Film,9,17 February 2020,"I watched this based on the fact i watched the Invisible guest its very difficult to make a butterfly effect film but its well put together and the actors are all excellent especially the lead Adriana Ugarte
The settings and storyline are very good it was a pity they dident show the conversation between young Nico and Older version but that was a minor detail
Is only a matter time before director Oriol Paulo is snapped up by hollywood a gifted writer and director would highly recommend",Mirage

Many Plot holes, starts somewhere and ends up in a total different mood, the characters were nonsense, the boy talked with a woman from tv for like 5 minutes and now he's obsessed about her somehow all his life lol, a magical storm and thunders that magically connects you with the past , too many character involvements and lots of stories going on that is hard to follow so it gets frustrating to find and focus on what is the main concept of the movie. Its a total mess. I give one star to lower the rating because this is ridiculous high . BIG MESS STAY AWAY",Mirage

184,ramyjelda,"Intense, enjoyable but many glitches",8,24 March 2019,"The movie is really good and highly recommended.. Time-traveling lovers would certainly enjoy it but there are many broken links and some inconvenient acts that would question the script...The biggest glitch/ twist is the inspector identity. People didn't mention that she's dating him (at least a name) which is the name of the only person she is looking for... It's obvious they kept it as the major movie twist but still could be directed better...Anyways, tbe movie is highly recommended and i endorse it for a movie that requires focus while watching.",Mirage
185,vicemonk,100 star,10,24 May 2020,Totally awesome movie with brilliant screenplay for an fictional experience.,Mirage
186,SaketG_Realest,"Interesting plot, well acted",8,31 May 2020,It has an interesting plot that does away with the typical time travel trope and keeps the sci-fi element to a minimum. Instead it focuses on its well structured and fleshed-out plot which is more unpredictable than predictable. The acting by the lead characters is superb. The story hooks you till the end. I am glad I came across this movie and didn't mind watching it with subtitles.,Mirage
187,Escobar512,Cliché and overused thematic,4,24 March 2019,"The time travel is getting a little bit old. I appreciate the force of production that we can see now a days to recreate different times in history and blablabla, but this parallel reality thing is getting out of hand, specially when is executed in this way, with awful plot-twits, is not you could see them coming, but when they do happen you get this ""really? thats it?"" feeling, maybe it's the fact that this movie is invested in romance but not quite to call it a main theme, it's just there as a tool o justification of the character actions and I dont like that, especially cause it feel weirdly acted and some lines feel forced. (I saw it in spanish as it is my main language). Anyways, just an opinion.Its great to see international directors come out and do stuff on netflix, but this I dont like at all.",Mirage
188,perez-56935,Very engaging movie!,8,5 July 2019,"I found this movie to be very engaging and well made. I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's interesting how good storytelling doesn't always need gratuitous nudity, sex, and violence. If I was a teenage boy, I'd probably disagree.",Mirage

190,itz_your_vish,A classic example of Time-Continuum theory,8,5 April 2020,"What would you do if you are caught in a circumstance where it questions you to choose between what you love the most and what you sub-consciously wish for in life, when time is the only constraint running out of your hand and your decision could change things FOREVER and might be IRONIC? It can change your past, and inturn alter your future. A perfect dilemma!!!The movie answers the aforesaid question and takes you to a rollercoaster ride of a scientific theory based on time-continuum. One fine day (when a meteor is passing closely to Earth on a stormy night), a woman interacts with a child, 25 years back in time via an old TV set, and tries to save him from death, knowing that a crime has been committed, due to which she accidentally alters both of their past and future. Will she succeed in making things normal is what follows the rest of the movie.The protagonist of this 2018 Spanish flick did a very commendable job in her quest to fix the missing piece of the puzzle till the end, however the second half becomes quite predictable if you are noticing the details very closely. On a whole, the movie explores how people react to something unexplainable and a plethora of human emotions such as love, loss and sacrifice. It will question you to think about difficult choices presented in life. Oriol Paulo's direction is top-notch and he has been successful in creating an intrigue and mystery like his previous works such as The Body. The movie is highly recommended to the ones who like fictions based on time-travelling such as Predestination and Coherence (Hollywood).My rating: 8.3/10",Mirage

194,kinglerch,An amazing movie with a fatal flaw,7,20 June 2019,"This is a really good movie with clues and a mystery and very believable and great acting. The story is even pretty unique although it borrows from some other time travel movies.The fatal flaw is the main character's motivation. She saves the boy from dying and inadvertently sends her life down a different path where she doesn't meet her cheating husband and instead becomes the most talented head of surgery in the hospital, saving lives everyday. She even has a different love, the boy she saved, a love interest. But noooo...this is not enough for her.She has to risk her own life and the lives of everyone she saves in the hospital so that she can go back to her cheating husband and have her exact daughter that she knew. No thought of adopting or having a child with her new love or any thought to the lives she saves as a surgeon. She has to fricking kill herself on the outside chance there is time to save the daughter as she knew her.I really liked her character until she did this. But still the movie survives as a 7 to me.",Mirage

198,paul-stableford-720-888180,"A beautiful, tense butterfly effect type movie",9,25 March 2019,"I loved the Butterfly Effect and was interested to see this as a Netflix movie after being very disappointed in others such as Triple Frontier and Velvet Buzzsaw.
Well all I can say is that Netflix has redeemed itself greatly with this offering, great characters, great performance and a great story, murder, tension and parallel time arcs thrown in.
It has a feel good ending matching four weddings but is so technically we'll crafted you forget all the complexities that have been woven into this movie.
If you love murder mysteries, time travel, suspense or even good old fashioned love stories then this is definitely for you.
A word of advice, alter the settings in netflix and watch in the original language with English subtitles, dubbing is not a good way to enjoy foreign cinema",Mirage
199,imdb-781-901533,Sci-fi movie involving a murder mystery and a mother's love,10,23 March 2019,"This is a high grade sci-fi drama movie involving time travel. The premise of the movie is build on the ""fragility"" of time. Any action or decision, no matter how small, changes a person's timeline. If someone somehow can change even a small action in past, it will lead to a parallel reality. The other universe will cease to exist. It is this this concept that the writer and director of the movie have captured with great precision.It involves a thunderstorm, an old TV camera and video recorder, Berlin's wall, a murder mystery and a mother's undying love for her daughter.As with any time travel movie, there will be paradoxes. The more you think about it, the more it plays on your mind. And eventually you will start reading Stephen Hawking's ""A brief history of Time"".The movie is every bit fascinating. It is normal to feel a little disoriented as the plot unravels due to montages of different timelines getting intertwined.I found the ending interesting.The spoiler:
It has a happy ending. The mother finally finds her daughter back. How, you'll get to know when you watch the movie.",Mirage
200,adnanbinrashid,Blown away,10,14 March 2021,I just finished watching it and I'm totally blown away. I can't believe I waited so long to have watched it. It's a beautiful time traveling movie.

I recommend this movie and will not be a waste of time",Mirage
213,mraaro,"Interesting concept with pretty intense moments, but too many obnoxious/irrational characters",4,24 March 2019,"I was excited seeing this title on my Netflix recommended list since I'm a big fan of Spanish thrillers. This one started off well enough but became more and more unbelievable and annoying the further we went through it. The characters' actions just didn't make much sense. A few examples:1. The kid: What kid runs into a neighbor's house when he sees them arguing violently? And then later: why would he break in when he sees the neighbor leave? Why not call the police? That would have solved everything (and made for a much shorter, less aggravating movie).2. The mother: I understand that the whole time travel/parallel universe thing would be confusing, but the mother (who is intelligent enough, considering she's a surgeon) just can't seem to get a grip on it. She harasses other people throughout the movie, acting like they're the crazy ones, when clearly she should just be playing along in order to figure out how to get back into her own universe.3. The professor. This is the most ridiculous character in the movie. She wrote a book about time travel and parallel universes based on what the kid's mother told her, but failed to talk to the kid or even find out if the kid existed. Absolutely ridiculous. That whole scene seemed like something from a parody movie.4. The cop. Does he have nothing better to do in his job than to keep chasing down the mother? First off, how does he find her at the airport? Then why attend a university lecture with the mother when you could just call the professor? Then later, when we find out he's married to the mother, why didn't the other cops mention the fact that it's pretty stinking weird that she knew where the body was buried? And this is to say nothing of the creepiness that he essentially planned to manipulate this woman to be with him since childhood.This isn't even the full list of issues with this movie. With more rational characters (and no ridiculous professor segment), this could have been a much better movie.",Mirage

He was supposed to remember Vera as the first time alteration happend with Vera and in 2nd time alteration it was Nico who instructed himself via TV. So Nico forgeting Vera seemd too much clumsy pothole that was unnoticed by the writer. Disappointed.,Mirage

This film is a very bad sample of its kind. It really tries hard but can not help being boring. I really don't believe all the 'fantastic film' comments are real.

227,mich_c-44867,very interesting if you are not bothered by the plotholes,7,15 April 2020,"The movie overall is interesting and the twist at the end is something I didnt expect. Though some questions were answered in the movie, it left a big plot hole.
the answered questions I had:
1. If the cop is the husband, why did no one react when she was acting crazy? it explained later on that the cop talked to the doctor beforehand.
2. It looks too easy for people to impersonate someone at the airport. Well, depending on the culture of the country, probably.
3. Why is it too easy for the cop to abandon his duties by releasing Vera after she was arrested? She is his wife, so probably given the privileged.
4. Even if you are a cop, you cannot just give away peoples address even if they are your family? again, this can only be answered by people in their country.Questionable plots:
1. The cop talk about his life infront of Angel looks kind of awkward. I don't think anyone would open up just like that.
2. The professor is definitely a solipsist, if not, she is full of s***.
3. What is with the 72 hours? Who came up with that and what is the rationale?
4. The boy just reported a murder and police did not even check the house or use a luminol test or anything(like calling the family) to confirm what the boy is saying but apparently, they were able to check the credit card transactions(which could be done by anyone) of the murdered wife in a short time(which I think requires a subpoena to check).
5. And the biggest plot I think is when Vera woke up and found herself in bed where everything is back to normal. She went to see the camera and it is not there. It was never there in the first place. So if it was never there, how could she have warned the boy to not go out. Which brings us to square one. The boy is not warned, he gets killed.Overall, I enjoyed it.",Mirage

I don't really know much about the actress, Adriana Ugarte (from The Time In Between tv series) . But I do know about Álvaro. He is from one of the best shows on Netflix. It's called Money Heist.

Great story with several plot lines that come together successfully at the end. The actors did an amazing job. It's very difficult for me to not find anything negative, but I really can't. Excellent.

252,qingyuehuaying,A film deserves contemplation.,9,1 April 2019,"The setting of the triplicate narrative lines which share multiple overlapped parts without any disorder blows my mind, but the film's merits are more than this. When Vera insisted on retrieving her daughter from another dimension and jumped from the balcony in front of Nick's eyes, it is hard to say there's any difference of intent as of which she decided to save Nick's life through the old TV. The two acts both derived from humanity which makes a distinction between animals and us. Although Vera could choose to abandon the whole life which had thoroughly vanished in the objective world and only remained in her memory as if an illusion, the bond between she and her daughter is much more than a fake thing. There is profound feeling- the pure love towards a specific person- which cannot be removed from her heart forever. In fact, no matter in this film or in real life, we all have uncountable possibilities of how to spend our lives, to choose whom to be our partners, to give birth to which child, to do which kind of work, and so on- all of these are full of uncertainties. As to Vera, she could have other hundreds even thousands of possibilities of lives, and she could have other daughters and sons. What truly matters is the feeling inside rather than the fact outside. Those possible- children hadn't affectional bond with her, but the specific girl in her memory had. What is true? It is a difficult question which has been asked and explored by countless philosophers and scientists and still had no exact answer. How to define life's continuousness and certainty? It may need to take more effort to work through, but ""justice"" and ""love"" which make us more human, or, more civilized, may permanently not be neglected and underestimated. The material world will step to its own end- the same destiny as us, but there must be a transcendental world which is permanent and indestructible, and the parts which connect us to it will be the final reality. Maybe I can believe this film told us ""not to cling to the concrete story of a life but to stick to the principles which make us be us."" Vera did precisely this kind of thing, as results, she had turned her life upside down: she saved Nick, retrieved her baby, discovered her husband's betrayal and turned in the murderer. The director left us an open-end, but we can conjecture that she would divorce and married Nick, and indeed, brought her lovely daughter with them. She rewrote her life by her humanity.",Mirage
253,loucctx-08016,Great and thought provoking time travel movie,10,24 March 2019,I was curious when I saw the preview for this movie. I am a huge fan of time travel movies and thought this film showed promise. I immediately became immersed into the various plot twists as well as the excellent acting. Some have commented how this movie makes the audience think outside the box and thus requires an open mind to fully appreciate the movie. I strongly recommend anyone that is a fan of time travel genre to give this movie a chance,Mirage
254,geraldpalomares,One of the best movie I've watched in a long time,10,25 March 2019,"I love how Oriol Paulo took a concept that has been exploited over and over but found a way to revamp it and tell a fascinating story. The story unfold with a series of clever revelations that kept me on the edge and smiling. The ending is particularly genius and put this movie in my top 10. The photography is exceptional and the acting of Lara Sendim is perfect. Overall, a great movie like everything Oriol Paulo does.",Mirage
255,jamirsentiamong,A brain jerker movie,9,27 March 2019,"A purely original concept and keeps u engaged from the begining till the end. Been following Oriol Paulo's directions and he's unbelievably one of a kind. Many indi film-makers will benefit from his style, n veterans would just become another fan of him. Few directors have remade his previous movies n have commercially done well too. This movie makes you believe!",Mirage
256,brianna_streeter,Superb!,10,28 March 2019,Mirage has been one of the best films I've seen in a long time. From the beginning I was intrigued and was left with my jaw to the floor by the ending. Beautifully written.,Mirage

258,dianemoodleydbn,Fantastic storyline,9,2 April 2019,"Finally a movie that has me on the edge of my seat, I had no idea what was going to happen next unlike most movies that are coming out where you have an idea or can predict what the plot is.I absolutely loved this movie , the acting complemented the storyline, superb!!!
I have my fingers crossed for a sequel.",Mirage
259,laurytuxx-47142,Amazing movie. Worth every minute,10,4 May 2019,"My first time review here and this movie deserves to be trending all over the places.
So creative, dramatic, intense.. You just don't want it to end. I feel sorry to those who won't get to see this masterpiece due to lack of popularity. Let's spread the word about this movie!",Mirage
260,marjanmilosavljevic,Oriol Paulo you are genious!,10,4 March 2020,"He did it again. Oriol Paulo you are genious! Every movie that he make, when you watching it it is like reading the book.Can't wait for next movie.",Mirage
261,randraafat,I'm in love,10,7 June 2019,"I LOVE THIS DIRECTOR his movies are literally awesome. One of the best movies that I've seen, it makes you enchanted with every moment..Not a repeated story. The cast did a great work.",Mirage
262,orfeasbak,Very smart,8,31 August 2019,The whole concept was very fascinating especially if you are a fan of parallel universes or time traveling,Mirage
263,rgp666,I saw this movie 18 years ago!,3,19 April 2019,"And his name is ""Frequency"".
I'm like another character in the movie, traveling in time to see exactly the same again. Storm included!
Connections between present and past through old devices (radio / camera), which modify the story but not in a way that is convenient for the protagonists, so they will have to give new warnings to the past to modify the present in a positive way (thanks once again ""Back to the Future ""!). Obviously, always against the clock and solving the murder.
A pity, this director was doing a very good career. I hope he comes back on the right track.",Mirage
264,marcovignola-59553,Very bad story,4,22 April 2020,A film that promises a grand finale but in the end very disappointing. plot very simple and without any inventiveness .. too bad,Mirage

266,giogeorge,Amazing movie ! Suspans all the way,10,14 April 2020,"Not seen such a good movie like this in a while. Spanish cinema, great !!!",Mirage
267,alvarodelgado-38409,"Excellent plot, amazing cast!",8,14 April 2020,"This is my first film from Oriol Paulo. The cast is amazing! Alvaro Morte, Adriana Ugarte and Chino Darin really deliver. The plot reminded me the sort of things you will find in Netflix's 'Dark' , which is great too, if you like time-traveling sci-fi drama this one will keep you entertained 😉👍🏽",Mirage
268,seriosha,Too round,6,10 April 2020,"Of course we could all wish everything in life made sense. Yet, as life isn't like that, when a story makes sense everywhere it starts to make no sense at all. This is what I think of this movie: while writing the plot there sure was a point when one of the authors would have said ""and also now, what if...?"" and the other should answer ""get out of here, this thing is already too round and stupidly perfect and by the way maybe we should use more than 8 people in this story"".",Mirage
269,siddharthchaturvedi-62603,Must watch movie,9,31 January 2021,"I loved the movie.. all the characters, all the plots and everything was just perfect. The story is full of suspense, you may predict some parts but the ending is worth everything loved this movie. Specially the sound effects it was at its best.Must watch this one. MIRAGE",Mirage
270,annadely,meaningless,1,8 March 2021,"The worst movie I have ever seen. It takes you from one to the other. we were looking to understand who is what. when it was over, i was nervous.",Mirage
271,arimavro,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,9,14 March 2021,It was one of the best movie I have ever seen. If you like mind-blowing movies like inception or tenet you should definitely watch it. The director thought everything!,Mirage
272,jakaram,Very good movie,9,9 August 2021,Excelent movie. It has a perfect development of the events. A good scifi movie.,Mirage
273,mdswain-1,Excellent Movie,10,13 July 2020,This movie reminds me of Dark (another GOOD Netflix original)... It's perfect for a sci-fi junkie like me.,Mirage
274,jeff-sullivan,Frequency much?,1,18 December 2020,"I would have given a higher rating if I hadn't already Frequency.
Whole storyline is almost exactly like Frequency.
Mysterious storms, a race against time, a future being changed....",Mirage
275,artonion,An astonishing amount of plot holes,4,19 August 2021,"This movie has an astonishing amount of plot holes. I'm amazed that anyone read any part of this script and went ""yeah, that sounds like something someone in that situation would do, let's make this movie!"" Overall, the alternate universe time travelling genre isn't know for its quality and if you enjoy The Butterfly Effect (2004), chances are you may have a good time with this one too. Why anyone would rate this movie higher than 6 is beyond me.",Mirage
276,marthikacl,Bad copy,6,2 November 2019,"It's a bad copy from Frequency. The houses from 89 are incorrectly decorated, the kid in the present has so diferent facial features... All the little things that create a story are wrong.",Mirage
277,Estebantropo,Amazing movie!,10,25 March 2019,"Great characters, story and mistery! A bit predictable if you ask me, but totally enjoyable! Perfect for a saturday night at home with bae or friends.The time travel stuff it's well done, a bit of romance with a spin off, murder, conspiracy, mother love, psychotic sense... make your choice!Grab some popcorn, a blanket, turn of the light and have fun with this movie.",Mirage
278,rosh8111,"Plot more like ""Frequency""",8,6 June 2019,"This plot is more like ""Frequency"" movie and tv series, they all connect from a wired storm and butterfly effect.",Mirage
279,sm_cipi,Great movie,8,23 March 2019,"Highly recommended, I don't want to give any spoilers, must watch !",Mirage
280,kerriebr,Great concept but the plot lets it down,5,29 March 2019,"If you are up for some light entertainment from a great concept, Mirage has a satisfactory overall storyline. But don't expect too much from the details. There are many unlikely decisions made by the characters, leaving the viewer thinking ... why? I would love to see the basic elements of this story tweaked into a more believable plot. Doesn't tick enough boxes.",Mirage
281,leecharlesmills,Mind blowing from the start,10,23 March 2019,Brilliantly put together and to me it had a stranger things feel to it. I do like a good time travel story and this is up there with back to the future and the butterfly effect.,Mirage
282,nickypettit-532-852606,Great film from start to end,9,2 April 2019,"I loved this film, a cross between a more sophisticated version of Back To The Future and a less.confusing version of The Buutterfly Effect. I notice a lot of reviews here point out the awful English dubbing. I did watch the trailer which was awfully dubbed however if you go into the Netflix options and turn this audio option off and simply watch the film in it's original Spanish language with English subtitles it's a 100% improvement and allows the actors abilities to shine through. Thoroughly enjoyable",Mirage
283,mahemever,Great,10,1 August 2020,"Top movie in time travel series
Even better than predestination",Mirage
284,sushisara,She still changed too many things,1,9 January 2020,"In other time travel movies, if you change the smallest thing you get another job, another kid, maybe another life, yet, she changed the life of the man who introduced her to her husband ,he now has a step father and a happy mother but nothing changed at all which is very unconvincing.",Mirage
285,kankukevin,Totally awesome.,8,22 March 2019,"I have become a huge fan of time travel-ish movies and psychology thriller lately. in fact i would admit that the series ""DARK"" on Netflix is still my top five netflix original and you should totally watch it if you haven't already.
Anyway, i really enjoyed ""Mirage"", i thought it was well written. well shot and well acted. i was on the edge of my seat the entire time. its definitely worth a watch.",Mirage
286,leigh-801-48781,Fantastic,8,21 May 2019,Little slow to start but as the story develops along with the characters you are drawn in to find the truth. Even though this is dubbed its a great compelling movie that keeps you hooked to the very end.,Mirage
287,abdulmajeed-875-989484,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE,10,16 April 2019,"Its is one of the best movie i have seen in quite some time, the twist, the plot, what the girl did for her daughter spectacular one of the best movie ever, its not a movie which i will see again but the movie which i will see with my family just to show them how nice this movie is",Mirage
288,misho73,wooooow. amazing movie,10,24 March 2019,This movie is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched. A kind that gives u the chills the whole time. a must watch. so much under-rated.,Mirage
289,TheFuturesYellow,Great concept but lots of laugh out loud errors!,7,19 May 2019,"First of all, I think everyone should give this movie a chance and a second viewing too! I loved the concept of the storyline being a bit of a BTTF fanboy, this was done in an almost supernatural Spanish alternative!On first showing there are a few characters who aren't really focused on enough and there whereabouts get a little lost in the second half, but the pieces kind of fall into place later on.However there are lots of plotholes which happen quite obviously which makes the production feel a little rushed! One springing to mind is the picture of the ex-girlfriend scene near the start where the main protagonist claims to not know who she is, then later it turns out they had met on a double date...There are a few others which should have been ironed out before shooting, but overall a good storyline and well worth watching.",Mirage
290,Yanina_eoy,Ok but...,5,2 October 2020,"Wasn't chino Darin meant to be at least 10 years older than her?
That was the biggest turn off for me. He was about 10 in 1989 so how can he be the same age as her in the present?",Mirage

293,gjurcinoska_martina,A fantasy more than a thriller or mystery,5,3 April 2020,"Just wanted to drop a quick review : this is a completely fantastic film. Nothing is real in this film. It is an amusing watch, has some mystery in it, however it is more a fantasy than a thriller or mystery. If you want to keep it real like me, this is not the movie to watch.",Mirage
294,callrandy-19942,Utter Brilliance,10,1 January 2021,"I am not going to share anything from this movie because I don't want to spoil anything. This film is one of the most original and brilliant scripts I have ever seen. The cinematography was amazing, the acting was impeccable and stars one of my new favorite actors, Alvaro Morte from Money Heist. It is very rare to finish a movie and your first thought immediately is to hit ""play from the beginning!"" A masterpiece of writing and film!",Mirage

But this one was brilliantly executed story line. Wife and I usually end up discussing what was missed, what did he/she say etc but the story line and script was easy to follow and most importantly it made sense for its genre. No one vanished in to thin air, no one faded slowly in to thin air, no CGI, it was just pure drama, suspense and awesome acting.",Mirage
300,crihancosmin,Not like how you imagine,10,3 April 2019,Time travel? Not exactly! I never understood how it could possibly work. I still don't. Whats' impressive about this film is that is so well done that you forget the paradox in front of you. You see exactly the pain of loosing a child or a life that you knew. To see a life you might have had and so on. It's very well done. Not the SCI-FI but the acting. This is trully a good film. A must see. I wanted to see it for the SCI-FI part and now I highly recomended for the good film it is! Go see it!,Mirage
301,ajechavarria,"Good movie, follows same premise as Frequency",7,27 February 2021,"I'm reading all these top rated reviews and I have to agree, in part. The movie is entertaining enough. However, if you want to see this movie, I'd recommend also giving Frequency (2000; Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel) a shot. After all, Paulo's screenplay isn't THAT original, as some reviewers say. The premise is the same, with a a different story.",Mirage
