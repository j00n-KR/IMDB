0,Leofwine_draca,"A messy, disjointed black comedy over the top enough to be worth a look",6,12 November 2016,"Tobe Hooper's follow-up to his gruelling horror classic is a bit of an unwieldy beast, a wildly uneven sequel that disgruntled many fans. Having watched it, I'm inclined to treat it as a film of two halves: an excellent first followed by a disappointingly vapid second. The idea was good, but it's the execution where this film suffers.Things kick off well with a fine if unbelievable set-piece with a victim being chainsawed in a speeding car (I couldn't figure out why he didn't just hit the brake?). From then on in we're introduced to a whole new cast, with the only returning member of the original film being Jim Siedow's creepy cannibal cook. Caroline Williams is a sassy, appealing heroine and there's inherent entertainment value in the presence of Dennis Hopper, a vengeance-crazed ex-lawman determined to bring justice to the chainsaw family.Things simmer along nicely until the major mid-term set-piece, in which a couple of crazed psychos wreak havoc at the radio station. This marks the introduction of Bill Moseley's bad guy 'Chop Top', one of the most over-the-top villains ever seen in a film! Moseley goes way beyond the call of duty with his performance here and set himself up for life in various B-movies. He delivers his outrageous dialogue with aplomb and has to be one of the most sheer insane characters I've witnessed.Sadly, the plot ends at this point, and the film carries on as the two good characters follow the bad to their lair (hidden beneath an old amusement park, somewhat inexplicably). There's a lot of padding after this, and then a frenetic climax which features Hopper battling Leatherface in a chainsaw duel while Williams attempts to evade the clutches of Chop Top. There's the return of the old man (now VERY old) and lots of grisly gore effects courtesy of SFX maestro Tom Savini, who as usual we can rely upon not to disappoint. But the pacing has gone and there's a sense of just waiting for the film to end; essentially this is a black comedy and the favouring of the gross-out over the genuinely horrific does work against it. All of the CHAINSAW sequels are uneven, but at least this first one has genuine vision – even if it is only in the first half of the movie.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
1,SnoopyStyle,scary Chainsaw turns to camp,4,22 June 2016,"In the 1973 original, Sally Hardesty-Enright was the sole survivor. She became catatonic and the police did not find the perpetrators. Thirteen years later, mysterious disappearances continue. Red River Radio DJ Stretch/Vanita Brock (Caroline Williams) gets prank calls from two idiots who get run off the road by the chainsaw welding family. Sally's uncle former cop Boude 'Lefty' Enright (Dennis Hopper) arrives after years of investigation.The original was disturbing and actually scary. There were moments of real originality. This sequel turns the franchise into camp. The thing is that director Tobe Hooper intends for it to be funny. It's not by accident. It's a deliberate act and it's lesser for it. It's full of silliness but it's that funny. In the exchange, the franchise loses all of the horror. It's almost a spoof of the original. The only compelling creepy scene is friend L.G. stumbling around eviscerated. Everything else is camp. Even Leatherface is a love-sick puppy. If you expect a spoof, this may be fun. If you expect something like the original, this may sicken you.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
2,kosmasp,Funny? Funny how?,4,21 October 2019,"This movie does not take itself too seriously and depending on your own taste and threshold you may find its depictions of violence and self deprecating humor funny - or not. Now going full comedy with the very first sequel to an original horror movie is quite a bold step to take. One that surely other franchises would not have survived.This one however got over it or enough people liked it and wanted more of the dysfunctional family. If that is a bad statement of society is something for others to decide. In the end these are just movies. The extend of love horror gets does not mean fans are crazy (mostly the opposite is true, if you actually care to engage with them). Having said that, it does also not mean one has to pander or rate something better than one things it is. You may disagree with my rating and if you think the movie is better, it means you enjoyed it more, which is good for you (and I mean that)",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
3,gavin6942,"Some Great Ideas; Went on a Bit Long, Though",7,15 February 2007,"Years after the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, chainsaw massacres continue to plague Texas in a variety of places, but the police cover them up as ""accidents"". Dennis Hopper knows better, and tries to track down the culprit. With the help of radio DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams) he may finally have figured out the mystery.Many fans will say they enjoyed this film more than the original. Heck, even Rue Morgue magazine (the Canadian equivalent of Fangoria) bluntly says this is the superior choice. And you know, they are probably right: this film is more fun. And sometimes fun is the key to success.Tobe Hooper was originally just the producer, and only stepped up to be director after several ""career conscious"" young directors passed up on it. He worked on the script, though he says the script's humor comes from co-writer Kit Carson, who also incorporated some of the phrases like ""dog will hunt"" and ""music is my life"". Hooper saw his input as making the film ""true to the Yuppie-ism of the 1980s"" and notes it is satirical even in its poster, which mimicked ""The Breakfast Club"".Dennis Hopper in any movie is a good idea, but Hopper with chainsaws is really about as good as it gets. I will not lie to you: the chainsaw fight in ""Motel Hell"" is better than the chainsaw fight in this movie, but either way: you have dueling chainsaws and Dennis Hopper. I cannot stress enough how cool that is (and if you do not understand, you are watching the wrong genre, my friend).Leatherface was sort of goony in this movie, looking very non-frightening, and shaking his head and shoulders every time he lifted his chainsaw (for reasons I cannot even attempt to explain). But he was made up for by Bill Moseley (Chop Top) with his very odd character and immortalized line, ""Dog will hunt"". Immortalized if you listen to the Primus song, ""Jerry Was a Racecar Driver"", that is. Moseley is now a horror movie standard, but this is arguably his most notable appearance and what brought his specialty to the attention of horror fans.Bill Moseley got hired after sending Hooper a Betamax tape called ""Texas Chainsaw Manicure"". Although already in his 30s, this was only his second film, previously appearing in the little-seen ""Endangered Species"" (1982). That film, incidentally, had JoBeth Williams just after she wrapped ""Poltergeist"", which may have been what inspired Moseley to audition.The gore is surprisingly minimal. Few people die, and even though corpses get chopped up and faces removed, it is really not very creepy. Hooper says that special effects maestro Tom Savini was ""more than inventive in coming up with some bizarre and gory detail"".While the film is more silly than scary in many ways and has a weak ending, it still has some sort of charm about it. Watch until the first death. If you like it, keep watching. If not, this film is not for you. Most likely, you will find this worth your time.The Fox-MGM Blu-ray has a handful of special features, including two commentaries. One with Tobe Hooper and another with the actors. Anything and everything you would want to know about the film is available on the disc (although Hooper is not quite as talkative as some directors).",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
4,jboothmillard,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,5,19 October 2020,"The original Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a little low-budget masterpiece, besides this, the only other films I have seen in the franchise include the not-so-good noughties remakes, and the terrible reboot sequel Texas Chainsaw 3D. I didn't realise there were any previous direct sequels until I saw bits and pieces of this second film shown in the 2019 version of Child's Play, so I knew I had to watch it, from returning original film director Tobe Hooper (Salem's Lot, Poltergeist). Basically, set a decade after the events of the original, police found the corpses of the various victims, but have been searching for the killers ever since, with no trace. High school students Buzz (Barry Kinyon) and Rick (Chris Douridas) are heavily intoxicated and racing in their car on a desolate stretch of road in Texas, heading to the Dallas Cotton Bowl for a football game. They use their car phone to call and harass on-air radio DJ Vanita ""Stretch"" Brock (Caroline Williams). Stretch cannot convince them to hang up and is forced to keep them on the line. The two pass a pickup, and Leatherface (Bill Johnson) emerges, wielding a chainsaw and rips through the car roof. Rick tries shooting Leatherface, but Leatherface cuts through Buzz's head, causing the car to crash, killing Rick. Stretch has been left alone in the studio but caught the sounds of the teenagers' deaths on tape. The following morning, former Texas Ranger Lieutenant Boude ""Lefty"" Enright (Dennis Hopper) arrives at the scene of the crime to investigate Buzz and Rick's murders. Lefty is the uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who were victims of Leatherface and his family years earlier; Lefty has spent the last thirteen years looking into reports of mysterious chainsaw killings across Texas. He is contacted by Stretch, who brings him a copy of the audio tape that recorded the attack. He sends her away, leaving Stretch to reluctantly get radio coverage of a Texas/Oklahoma Chili Cookoff. The winner happens to be Drayton Sawyer (Jim Siedow), patriarch of the cannibalistic Sawyer family, who declares that his secret is having an eye for ""prime meat"" (obviously the meat is human remains). Meanwhile, Lefty shops for chainsaws at a local hardware store. He at first unnerves, then amuses the shop's owner (James N. Harrell) with his aggressive testing of the saws on a log. Lefty then drives to Stretch's radio station and asks her to play the tape on her nightly radio show so that the public, so that will listen to and believe his case. Drayton, driving home from his chili cookoff victory, overhears the attack on the radio, and demands his family go to the radio station. While preparing to leave for the night, Stretch is confronted by the deranged and sadistic Bobby ""Chop Top"" Sawyer (Bill Moseley). Chop Top taunts and freaks Stretch for some time, before being attacked by Leatherface. Her co-worker L.G. Peters (Lou Perryman) is apparently killed by Chop Top, who hits repeatedly on the head with a hammer. Leatherface corners Stretch and is about to kill her, but she charms him into sparing her. Leatherface returns to Chop Top and leads him to believe that he has killed Stretch. The Sawyer brothers then take L.G. to their home, followed by Stretch, to their new home, an abandoned carnival ground decorated with human bones, multi-coloured lights, and carnival remnants. Lefty has been following them, he arrives equipped with chainsaws and trashes the home before finding the remains of Franklin. Meanwhile, Stretch is trapped in the Sawyer home. She is found by Leatherface, who puts L.G.'s skinned face and hat on her before tying her arms and leaving. L.G. himself is still alive and frees Stretch before dying. Drayton finds Stretch and she is captured by the family. Chop Top scolds Leatherface after lying about killing Stretch. They torture her at the dinner table, trying to get Grandpa Sawyer (Ken Evert) to kill her, but Lefty arrives and saves her. Stretch flees and tries to find a way out, being chased by Chop Top, while Lefty wounds Drayton. Lefty and Leatherface get into a chainsaw fight, and Leatherface is fatally wounded. Drayton is dying and accepts he and his family have lost, so he takes a grenade from a corpse, and pulls the pin, with the explosion killing himself, Grandpa, Leatherface and Lefty. Chop Top chases Stretch to the top of a rock tower. Stretch finds the family's grandmother in a shrine, she grabs the chainsaw held by the corpse. She fatally wounds Chop Top, causing him to fall off the tower to his death, and Stretch shouts in triumph while swinging the chainsaw in the air. Hopper is okay as the mad former police officer, Williams does alright as the lead female, Siedow as the head of the family of cannibals is suitably creepy, and Moseley is laughably insane as Leatherface's brother, but why Leatherface been turned into a less sadistic character? There are no complaints about the violence and gore (which the original does not have much of), I can see why it caused some controversy, but the story and pace is uneven a few times, and I don't like a less aggressive almost pathetic Leatherface, but overall, it is a reasonable horror. Worth watching!",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
5,BA_Harrison,A wonderfully eccentric and unique sequel to the '74 shocker.,10,19 October 2006,"Twelve years after Leatherface was left dancing his chainsaw ballet on a deserted blacktop, director Tobe Hooper delivered a sequel, the not-too-imaginatively titled The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.Rather than attempt the impossible and try to top the level of terror achieved by his gritty, but fairly blood-free original, Hooper wisely tackled the follow-up in a completely different manner: the second outing for his cannibalistic clan utilised bucket-loads of Grand Guignol-style gore and black humour to help tell the macabre story.An opening voice-over reveals that after the original movie's events, no evidence of the killers or their hideout was discovered and, despite a spate of strange disappearances in the following years, the police still refuse to believe in the existence of a murderous cannibal family.Hooper then dives straight in with a terrific opening sequence that quickly sets the tone for the whole film: a pair of yuppies driving down a lonely highway meet the their gory fates at the hands (or rather, chainsaw) of Leatherface (Bill Johnson). Sassy Texan radio DJ, Stretch (Caroline Williams), who is talking to them on the phone when the attack occurs, records their death screams on the radio station's tapes. Extremely violent (one of the yuppies has the top of his head sliced clean off like a boiled egg!) and nightmarish in its execution, the beginning lets the audience know that they are in for an experience totally unlike the '74 classic.Stretch approaches Lieutenant 'Lefty' Enright (Dennis Hopper), a bible thumping lawman obsessed with finding the killers who slaughtered his brother's children, and offers him the tape as evidence that the chainsaw killers really exist. Lefty convinces Stretch to play the tape over the air which results in Leatherface and Vietnam-veteran Choptop (Bill Moseley) paying the DJ a visit.Stretch barely survives an attack at the radio station (by appealing to Leatherface's sexual desires) and, perhaps unwisely, she trails the maniacs back to their lair. Following close behind her is Lefty, kitted out with power tools and hell-bent on revenge and retribution...TCM2 combines the horrific premise of the original with the gaudy look of Hooper's Eaten Alive and the freakish fairground setting of his 1981 slasher The Funhouse. The result is a demented, dark, and delirious film that was totally misunderstood by critics on its 1986 release who, expecting a carbon copy of the '74 film, refused to accept Hooper's vivid OTT imagery or his twisted sense of humour.Unlike TCM, the killers (and some of the victims) in the sequel are grotesque caricatures, designed to repulse, yet also amuse: Dennis Hopper's Lefty is almost as crazy as those he seeks (he thinks nothing of using Stretch as bait) and is clearly missing a few marbles; Bill Moseley is great as Choptop, a more than capable replacement for Edwin Neal's psycho hitchhiker; Jim Siedow returns as a kooky cannibal cook who keeps the clan in order; and even Grandpa makes an appearancenow 137 years old and still a dab-hand with the lump hammer (not).Caroline Williams makes a great heroine: looking absolutely yummy in her tiny tight shorts (what a pair of gams!), she combines sexiness with bravado, and still manages to give Marilyn Burns a run for her money in the screaming stakes.Tom Savini's gruesome make-up is as nauseatingly realistic as one might expect and certainly makes this a film for those who love the gore. The catalogue of messy effects on show include the aforementioned head-slice, a nasty hammer attack, a 'face removal', assorted severed body parts, and a whole heap of guts and internal bits 'n' bobs.The 'Gruesome Edition' DVD also includes a couple of notorious deleted scenes which will be of interest to TCM fanatics: Leatherface and family attack some teenagers in an underground garage (this moment is saddled with some bloody but rather iffy effects and a dose of silly humour); and the family go to a cinema where they slice up a couple of women in front of movie critic Joe Bob Briggs (another bit of crap humour, wisely excised from the final film).If you are a fan of the original, please view this film with an open mind. Don't make the mistake of comparing it to TCM; judge it on its own merits and you will hopefully end up appreciating it for its many gory and excessive 'charms'.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
6,Quinoa1984,"well, at least it's better than the remake",7,10 July 2006,"Which maybe might not be saying much, as the one-line summary suggests. This was the first of the series of Chainsaw films that would follow with part 3 (Leatherface), and the first quasi-remake years later. And, perhaps my default, I found this to be the best out of all of them. Maybe that isn't saying much though- this is a trashy, wretched, violent mash of a horror film that injects in dark comedy that borders on being too-much of a crazy thing, while still keeping true to the delirious, paranoid nature of the first film. This time, as well, in one of Dennis Hopper's three films of 1986, there's a star anchor that is almost not even really there to give the film any more prestige than it could have. The film's real stars are the guys who have come back to play the family again- the father, the brother, and ol' Leatherface himself (this time Bill Johnson not Gunnar Hanson). And, of course, Grandpa is there too.Now, to be sure, the film's real enjoyments are those of it being so over-the-top and outrageous horror- one gets the sense already of what the tone will be from the opening when Leatherface uses his skills on a freaked out car driving alongside. The music in this scene is harsh and strange, and sometimes even the funniest moments there on in have a dangerous quality to them. The performance of the brother, too, with his wire-hanger obsession, adds some weird interest. Invariably, to say that the story itself is as good and tense as the first one is probably not true at all. This time it's got to do with Hopper's character, out for revenge for the deaths in the first film, and a female disc-jockey caught up in the delirium of cannibals and the insane production design. So, as a film really as 'guilty pleasure', I'd say it was good enough for what it was meant for- lots of still crude (even with a bigger budget) scenes of action and attack, and an un-hinged quality that makes most of the performances work well enough. But it's also lacking that gritty, immediate post-Vietnam war feeling of ultimate dread that made the original a classic of its kind.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
7,BandSAboutMovies,Perfection,9,18 October 2017,"n my Fangoria reading youth, there were two constants: Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the scariest movie ever and Tom Savini was the master of gore. If you put that chocolate into that bloody peanut butter, what would you get? And in a world where Freddy, Jason and soon, Michael Meyers would all get sequel after sequel, why not Leatherface?Two failed films into his Cannon Pictures deal, one would assume that Tobe Hooper felt the same way. And even though Chainsaw 2 would double its slim $4 million dollar budget, it wasn't considered a success by audiences and critics for years — similar to how Halloween fans just could not see Halloween 3 as a great film until the last few years.Whereas Chainsaw seems to be a nuanced film based on dread, mood and cinema vérité, the sequel is in your face, replete with tons of gore, overwhelming screams and saw noises and near slapstick moments. Maybe it's because Tobe Hooper, unlike nearly every other human being on the face of the Earth, saw the first film as a black comedy and this was just the next logical progression. For me, I saw Chainsaw 2 as a middle finger, an f you to the expectation that the film needed to be just more of the same. Ironically, Rob Zombie seems to have fallen in love with this film so much that he's filmed variations of it several times and even used some of the cast.Read more at bandsaboutmovies.com/2017/09/13/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-2-1986/",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
8,Coventry,"Same director, same title but a totally different style...",4,17 September 2003,"Sequels to absolute horror-milestones...That's usually a very bad idea ( anyone remembers the stupidity of The Exorcist II and the Howling II ? ). And the original from 1974 WAS an absolute milestone in the genre. Its cruel and scary style changed the horror industry forever. So keeping that in mind, my expectations towards this sequel were very low. But I must admit there were several elements about this production that made me give it the benefit of doubt...First and foremost Tobe Hooper directed again. Most directors don't feel much for making a sequel to their own masterpieces so I thought it was rather positive that Hooper returned. After all, he has proved he's able to make a masterpiece. Then I read Tom Savini himself was responsible for the makeup in TCM 2. If you know your horror, I don't have to explain you this is a guarantee some for good old gory and bloody scenes. And, last but certainly not least, the castlist was filled up with the name of a star. Dennis Hopper would play Lefty...the uncle of some of the youngsters who got killed in the original TCM.WARNING === SPOILERS COMING UP !! Now, after viewing TCM 2 a couple of times, I still don't know whether I should like it hate it. I'm a huge fan of the original but this is something completely different. I've heard some people saying that this is how Hooper the original wanted to be ! Well, if that is true he made an unintentional masterpiece and he should be thankful for that. This sequel certainly isn't bad, but it's disappointing if you expect something similar to the first. It all starts well, with another introduction by a strong and severe voice over but pretty soon it turns into a gore comedy with loads of blood, guts and crazy one-liners. The whole tight and creey atmosphere (which made the original so great) has gone. So has the element of surprise ! There isn't much of a storyline present neither...Lefty, a former Texas Ranger hunts down the maniacs while the government tries to cover it up. The psycho Sawyer-family has gone through some changes, though. Dreyton is now a respected citizen and every year he wins a trophy for making the best chili in Texas ( the secret is in the MEAT, he says in his speech. lol ). Being helped by a radio-dj, Lefty finds their house and starts a little demolition... END SPOILERS !!!Bill Moseley as Chop Top is probably the most remarkable character in TCM 2. He's an hyperactive little maniac and some of his quotes ( ""Lick my plate"") are very popular among horror fans. His background story interested me more and I recommend you to pay attention to that as well when watching it. I've always been a fan of Dennis Hopper, so I'm glad to see him star in a B-horror movie. The girl can't act very well, but she does leave a good scream-queen impression ! The way she yells would even make Jamie Lee Curtis jaleous... I have few complaints about the first half of TCM 2. It's creative and funny and a good change. The second half however is a failure, in my opinion. This half is boring and gore at the same time...believe me, that is not a good combination. You won't regret watching it, but if you're a fan of classic and scary horror, you should stick to the original. Everything that came after this sucks harder, though. We've got two more sequels ( among the worst movies ever made ) and right about now, we have an utterly pointless remake of the first...which I'll boycot :-)Favorite ""rewind""-moment...Dennis Hopper testing chainsaws in the story. He swings them around like they're umbrellas. The expression on the salesman's face is hilarious",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
9,Scarecrow-88,The saw is what we live by.,7,30 August 2006,"A direct reverse of the original, this sequel is a comedy(albeit a twisted one)masquerading as a horror film. There's never really a moment where you experience true horror. This film, thanks to a much larger budget, is too polished to get under the skin(..unless you are easily offended by cannibal jokes). I don't recall one genuine moment that haunts you or even scare you. Despite what happens to heroine Williams, you never feel like she'll not survive. Several of those key ingredients this film lacks is what gave the original it's punch and long-lasting status as a film that must be experienced by every horror fan. The film really boasts having Hopper in it..though, to be honest, he's coasting here. It's Williams who gets the camera time..well, her and Leatherface(..which can be a good and bad thing). Leatherface has all the aura of terror stripped from him here and he's more of a laughing-stock. His brothers torment him and we get an understanding of why he's so strange. The film has a tour-de-nuts performance from Moseley as the brother with a silver plate on his skull(..to add dimension, he often takes a hanger and peels off dead skin from his head, around the silver dome, to munch on)and tendency to use a dead corpse as a puppet to speak through. Poor Williams just gets a raw deal as she tries being heroic, going to ex-Texas ranger Hopper with a recorded taping of a murder by Leatherface and Moseley of two college partiers. Hopper seeks vengeance for the murder of a relative at the hands of the Sawyer family. Using poor Williams, he finds their creepy lair..an abandoned amusement park. Williams goes through pretty much the same as the original version's heroine. Her head is stuck over a bucket for great grandpa to beat over with a hammer. She gets her own friend's skinned face placed on there by Leatherface..and is made to dance with him! She has to fight through all kinds of hell to escape their lair after falling through a hole in the ground. This film is loaded with gore, lots of chainsaw stabbings(..we see Leatherface's guts hanging out as Hopper hacks away with his own chainsaw), and demented humor. It's overkill, but the blasted movie is so enthusiastic and over-the-top, the sequel becomes entertaining within all the madness.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
10,Hey_Sweden,"""I'm the Lord of the Harvest.""",7,24 September 2012,"Tobe Hooper follows up his legendary shocker with this dozen years belated sequel, which he'd always intended to be outrageous in a different sort of way. Things still get pretty intense, but there is a more blatantly humorous approach (albeit in a dark way): ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" is very campy stuff. Therefore, it may take more than one viewing to be able to appreciate it, as was the case for this viewer. Gone, also, is the suggestion of horrible violence, to be replaced by much more obvious, in-your-face gore supervised by makeup effects master Tom Savini. And he does some extremely impressive work here.The story has a nutty former Texas Ranger, ""Lefty"" Enright (Dennis Hopper) obsessed with revenge against the cannibalistic Sawyer clan, as he turns out to be the uncle of the Sally and Franklin characters from the first film. Lefty leans upon radio DJ ""Stretch"" Brock (sexy, husky voiced Caroline Williams) to air a tape she'd made of two dim bulb kids being slaughtered by Leatherface while tooling down the highway. This only angers the Sawyer family, who proceed to terrorize Stretch over and over again.One very effective element to this sequel is its visual design; things are taken to another level in terms of the production design, lighting, and set decoration, as the Sawyers have headquartered in an old run down theme park. The music score, credited to Hooper and Jerry Lambert, is decidedly more conventional than that of the first film, and the eclectic soundtrack includes tunes by the likes of Timbuk 3, Concrete Blonde, The Cramps, and Stewart Copeland. The early set piece on the highway is a great one, and the action in the old park takes on an unrelenting, nightmarish tone, although ultimately it's not quite as effective as the simplicity of the first TCSM.The acting is over the top from most everybody concerned; Hopper is a hoot in his unhinged performance, Williams does a lot of screaming (so much of it that it may annoy some viewers), Jim Siedow is delightful as the put upon Drayton ""Cook"" Sawyer, Bill Johnson (replacing Gunnar Hansen) gets to show us a different side of Leatherface, and Bill Moseley, in a hell of a breakthrough performance, is memorable as live wire Chop Top. Ken Evert takes over the role of Grandpa from John Dugan, and Lou Perryman is endearing as good ol' boy L.G.; his final scene with Williams is really fairly poignant.The screenplay, by L.M. Kit Carson, contains some gems of dialogue, and there's one very enjoyable jump scare during the confrontation sequence at the radio station.While the excesses of this sequel may not appeal to some tastes, they're bound to delight others. All things considered, this is a pretty good follow-up to a classic film, and is generally regarded as the cult favourite of the series.Seven out of 10.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
11,preppy-3,Easily one of the worst horror sequels ever made,1,17 April 2006,"According to this movie the killers from the original ""Texas"" were never caught and are still roaming around. The uncle (Dennis Hopper!) of one of the victims is hunting for them. For some reason the family sets its sights on pretty DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams). Pretty soon she has Leatherface running after her with his chainsaw. She's captured and then the film REALLY gets sick.Just hopeless. What the hell was directer Tobe Hooper on when he did this? It seems like he's trying to do this as a black comedy. The problem with that is that it isn't funny--just pretty sick. The opening attack is gory, violent and lots of fun...then the film slowly falls apart. The story rambles all over the place--jumping from unfunny humor and truly sick violence never finding a consistent tone. Hopper chews the scenery every chance he gets (was he rehearsing for ""Blue Velvet""?) . Williams is good but really...this film goes way too far in what's done to her. At one point Leatherface basically tries to use his (turned-off) chainsaw to have sex with her; at another point he takes the skin off of a victim and puts it on HER face! This isn't funny or scary--just sick. Hooper's direction is off too--no surprise there. His movies since ""Texas"" have been just horrible--""Texas"" was a fluke. (""Poltergeist"" doesn't count--Spielberg had that whole movie storyboarded before Hooper even got on the set!) I caught this at a theatre back in 1986. It was unrated (basically a self-imposed X) so (lucky me) I caught it in all its ""glory"". (I heard the R rated one is edited). I was sickened, confused and (by the end) bored. The very end was just SO stupid I thought they were kidding. Just dreadful. Let me put it this way--I'm a HUGE horror movie fan but this was so terrible I refused to see the third one that came out a few years later. Skip this one.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
12,poolandrews,I actually rather liked this mixture of horror/black comedy.,7,24 September 2004,"And for that I apologize to no one! Why do I like it, well firstly I should say a little bit about the films story. We open in Texas, with two idiotic yuppie annoying kids driving along in a flashy Mercedes named Buzz (Barry Kinyon) and Rick (Chris Douridas), they call a local radio station and wind the host Vanita Brock (Caroline Williams) up who goes by the nickname of 'Stretch', they also play chicken with a pick up truck forcing it off the road, which they find very funny. Later on that night they call Stretch again and start annoying her (and us, the viewer) again. Then they come across the pick up from earlier blocking the road, it backs up and lets them through but starts to chase them over a bridge, side by side. Leatherface (Bill Johnson) jumps up from the back of the pick up and kills them both with a chainsaw. All of this is captured on the radio and recorded. Lieutenant Enright (Dennis Hopper), know as Lefty to his friends has been trying to track the chainsaw killers down for years in revenge for his brother who was killed by them in part 1. He arranges an appeal for information in a local paper. Stretch see this and takes the tape to Lefty at his hotel, at first he seems disinterested, but manages to persuade Stretch to play the tape on air that evening so he can flush the killers out. It works and the chainsaw family of Leatherface, Chop Top (Bill Moseley) and their rambling and frankly plain annoying Father (Jim Siedow) hear the recording on the radio and go after Stretch, and in turn Lefty goes after them armed with a couple of chainsaws of his own. But will he be able to save Stretch and put an end to the chainsaw families murderous activities? You'll have to watch to find out!Directed by Tobe Hooper who directed the original, I thought Texas chainsaw 2 was a good film. Some of the black humour falls a little flat, especially Jim Siedow's head of the family character, he rabbits on about nothing in particular and is a little hard to understand, very annoying. The gore, by Tom Savini is good and there are one or two nasty sequences in there, someones head is cut in half with a chainsaw, someone is beaten to death with a hammer, there's a slit throat plus there's a pretty gross scene where Leatherface slices someones face off with an electric carving knife and you should see what he does with it afterwards. The script by L.M. Kit Carson keeps moving at a fair pace and kept me entertained, I liked it. Production values are solid enough and it has a certain Hollywood polish about it that was definitely lacking in the original, whether this is a good thing or not is up to you to decide. Apparently the film had a troubled production with infamous producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus supposedly messing around with it post production, there are some cut scenes floating around on a laser disc somewhere which I have seen and among other things include more killings and gore, would have been nice if they had left that stuff in there.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
13,Boba_Fett1138,Lightning very rarely strikes twice.,5,15 June 2011,"Everybody knew in advance that there was no way his sequel wasn't going to be as great or was going to have the same impact as the first movie. It must be the reason why they tried something new and different for this movie but this however really didn't worked out too well.Biggest disappointment the fans of the first movie will have with this sequel is that it's totally lacking as an horror. The tension and the atmosphere of the first movie, which was its biggest strength, is pretty much gone in this one and even the Leatherface character in this movie isn't as threatening anymore. As a matter of fact, he isn't even the main villain of this movie.But there are plenty of more reasons why this movie falls flat as an horror/slasher. For one they even added lots of comedy this time, as if they really weren't taking themselves that serious, which really goes at the expense of the tension of the movie.I even think Tobe Hooper never really wanted to make this sequel but got somehow forced to after failing to get his career as an established director of big Hollywood movies off the ground. Making a sequel to his own horror classic, 12 years later, was the only way for him to keep working and keeping his name in the spotlight.What makes the movie in itself also pretty bad is the fact that it are basically two totally different movies combined into one. The first and second half of the movie are quite different in style and tone. The second half of the movie is definitely more in style with the 1974 classic but unfortunately it still isn't half as powerful or gruesome.The movie still has a couple of great gore moments in it though. Moments that are mostly made great by Tom Savini's expert make-up effects. But other than that, there really is nothing that makes this movie distinct itself from other average genre movies, except for the presence of Dennis Hopper in this perhaps.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
14,view_and_review,I Still Have a Headache,2,5 November 2019,"Loud, noisy, obnoxious, irritating, and psychotic. That's how I'd describe this movie. It was headache inducing, mind boggling, and brain scrambling. Did there have to be so much yelling, screaming, and overall inanity? The massacre family--dad, brother, and Leatherface--were in constant incoherence.The main victim--let's talk about the main victim really quick. Why did she even pursue the massacre family to their digs? What was she going to do anyway? This is not like it was the days of cell phones where she could follow and call the authorities. At best she finds their hideout and informs the police later. At worst, she's their dinner. The risk was not worth the reward.And Dennis Hopper's character, what was his deal? He went after the massacre family armed with chainsaws!?! This is Texas man. Bring a gun. Heck, bring three.This movie was yelling, screaming, and bad decisions. Sounds like a frat party except bloodier.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
15,Aaron1375,This chainsaw movie is a bit strange and has a crazy vibe to it.,6,17 October 2006,"This one was made in the 80's and it shows. The music, the picture quality everything screams 80's. It also has a bit of a Italian zombie movie feel to it as well thanks to the music and the make up by Tom Savani...this movie just seems kind of weird. The only remaining cast member from the original appears to be the cook from the first movie and he plays his role about the same. Gunnar isn't back to be Leatherface which is a shame, but the guy who took his place is all right. The story has a ranger or something played by Dennis Hopper looking for the chainsaw family as his relatives were killed in the original movie. The location of our favorite family, underground in what appears to be a theme park of some sort making award winning chili and preparing meats for all those hungry football fans. And yes this one adds a touch of demented humor to the mix. A really nice looking DJ with great legs happens to record a couple of dummies being killed by the chainsaw clan and tries to help Hopper find them, he ends up using her to find them. I found this movie okay, but to many underground scenes and another dinner scene kind of drag the movie down a bit. I would have liked to see them out and about more like in the first gruesome kill. There is a cool chainsaw fight at the end in which I have read where people have complained it was to short, but I thought it lived up to expectations. I do think I prefer the more recent remakes, however, as they portray Leatherface as a lot more intimidating, here he doesn't even get a good send off.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

This is more of an 80s cheese-fest, deliberately campy and entirely insane. The same family of murderers and cannibals returns. They now live in an abandoned amusement park and are occasionally slaughtering victims for decoration/meat purposes. One of their murders (of two '80s-style douchebags) is captured live on the radio by a late-night DJ (Caroline Williams). A police lieutenant who has been on the chainsaw massacre case (Dennis Hopper) hooks up with her in order to fish for the murderers. Despite the film's general lack of acclaim, Hooper has a lot to be proud of with this movie. It's so crazy and over-the-top that I found it hard not to love. I mean, come on: don't tell me you couldn't watch Dennis Hopper go nuts with a chainsaw.

20,KineticSeoul,"Different from the first, but watchable",5,20 August 2014,"This one just didn't seem as raw and realistic looking, like some sort of documentary style horror/slasher movie like the first one. But it's still a sequel that is actually draws the audiences in with shock factors. And still carries on the elements of madness almost as much as the first one. After viewing this, I can tell why this has reached cult status. Not as much as the first one, but it still a horror/slasher movie that works. I think it's cool that they decided to do something different with this one, instead of it basically being a rehash of the first one. I think some critics bash on this one comparing it with the first installment. Mainly because it lacks that raw atmosphere and demented psychotic craziness. While it lacks in the realistic and raw element, it sort of makes up for it with certain weirdness that you either gonna like or will not. Overall, this is a bizarre and goofy sequel, with Leatherface doing a bizarre shake dance before trying to kill someone with a chainsaw while having a crush on a radio DJ. In another words Leatherface just isn't as menacing or intimidating as he was in the original. Despite that, this sequel is something to watch for the bizarreness almost to the level of the movie ""Dead Alive"". Just don't expect a serious tone movie, but a movie that revolves around dumb crazy people and a goofy chainsaw wielding psycho. It even has a one on one chainsaw duel.5.5/10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
21,thesar-2,Illegal Lefty Turn,1,1 April 2010,"What a violent, horrible, gruesome, pointless and definitely vile movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 was. I can't even increase this mess above 1 star even with the somewhat creativity in the sets and the change of ideas/scenery from part one. I won't allow any leniency to this piece of TRASH.Anyone that complains about the poor quality (including myself) of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels should know this takes the prize in rapid decent in quality. Sure, the movie's based on violence and the acts of the stupid (cannibalism is one thing, eating your own flesh from a hanger is just plaindumb), but beyond the blood, there's absolutely nothing. This movie is just stupid and completely evil. And I am not referring to the characters.The plot involves the family moving across Texas to wreck havoc and collecting bodies to producechili. Originally, when I was younger and saw this for the first time, this grossed me out. Perhaps, I've become immune, but this viewing just made it look silly.Anyways, a radio disc jockey (Williams) hears a killing and is persuaded by a renegade officer, ""Lefty"" (Hopper) to continuously replay the killing on tape on her show to draw out the bad family. It works! But to the near death of said radio employee.She's quickly introduced to the family of saws and it's up to chainsaw wielding Lefty to take down the family in an underground fantasy land.Seriously, this movie, this turd, is so full of plot holes, so full of stench it should never have been made. I only forced myself to complete the movie (I don't write reviews on uncompleted viewings of movies I watch) so I can report people need to stay away from this. I cannot believe the director of the classic original returned to direct this.There is absolutely no reason to watch this. Even if you're into this sadistic genre, there's hundreds of other films to check out. Ones with plot, acting, somewhat good dialogue, character explorationthis movie contains none of those. SKIPit's not even for the curious.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
22,lost-in-limbo,pure slapstick or horror?,6,28 December 2004,"A former Texas Marshall (Dennis Hopper) tries to track down the Saw family, after they killed his nephew and made his niece go insane and he uses a radio host (Caroline Williams) as the bait to do so.Well this film by Tobe Hooper is definitely a ridiculously over the top parody of the original, far less atmospheric and chilling than it's predecessor, but still quite diverting if your in the right frame of mood.Though some fans of the original really go out there way to bag out this mockery of a sequel, but I didn't mind the sudden change and weirdness of it, but true it never captures the originals rawness and realism that made it so unique and compelling.This time around the horror is replaced by slapstick comedy, especially the performances from the Bill Moseley as the crazy Chop-top and Bill Johnson as the sympathetic Leatherface, which a softer side of him is shown. There was humour in the original, but it was way subtler compared to the sequel. Dennis Hopper just looked pretty bemused in his role (probably wondering oh WHY?), taking it way too seriously and because of that I found him incredibly comical. Caroline Williams wasn't too bad as DJ Stretch, Jim Siedow returns from the original to play Drayton Sawyer the cook and Grandpa is back and much more livelier in this film, which kinda baffled me. All of the performances are hilarious in a bad way.Tom Savini supplied the gore and make-up and what I saw was good, with the great detail you expect to see from his work. Though I wouldn't have got to appreciate all of it, as the version I watched on cable felt like it was cut.Nothing more than a rehash of the first film, but playing for laughs than horror... though it does have its nasty bits.2.5/5",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
23,ericstevenson,Pretty typical,5,10 October 2017,"This movie's main flaw is that it spends a lot of its time just setting stuff up and not having any action. Yes, I know the original did it but here, it's a lot of stuff that doesn't seem relevant to the story. That being said, there are some good things here. In the end, we get to see a sword fight with chainsaws! Oh, and somehow Leatherface gets impaled. I had no idea he could come back from the dead. I thought this was just a normal series. Anyway, this had its good points and bad points. It does improve on the original on one aspect.The sets actually look nicer. I guess that's probably because this movie is twelve years later and they had time to improve on special effects. A lot of it is still a retread from the original film. I'm especially annoyed by them doing that same sledge hammer and head over the bucket routine. I didn't realize how prolific Dennis Hopper was. Of course he'd be in a movie like this!

24,CuriosityKilledShawn,Texas cheesecake,6,5 November 2012,"Hate me if you want, but I never understood the high regard for the first movie. Yeah, I get the grim documentary tone, and I respect that, but there is only ONE massacre with a chainsaw, and it happens off-screen, while the rest of the film is also virtually bloodless. Nah, it's not something I rate highly.This bizarre sequel only crossed my radar when I saw it on sale rather cheap and I was surprised by how much I liked it. Taking place 13 years after the first movie it opens with a couple of Yuppies being massacred with a chainsaw (sadly, the only chainsaw massacres in the whole movie) and the case promptly investigated by renegade Texas Ranger 'Lefty' Enright (the brilliant Dennis Hopper). The sound of the killing is caught on tape by radio DJ-type lady 'Stretch', who Lefty uses as bait to lure Leatherface out of the shadows. The trail leads to the labyrinthine catacombs beneath an abandoned amusement park for an epic showdown that doesn't really happen.The problem begins with the second half in which Dennis Hopper seems to wander off into a different movie and nothing really becomes of his character while Stretch runs screaming from a horny Leatherface. It's a bit disappointing in this regard, but the wonderful set-design and gore effects keep it interesting. I just wish that there was more fodder for the titular chainsaw.A lot of people consider this to be a spoof, but I don't think so myself. Horror movie-making had changed a lot by this point in the 80s. With slashers and the tools of their trade gaining popularity the genre moved away from gritty, grindhouse darkness and into something more colorful and mainstream (for better or worse). TCM2 is just a reflection of that. It's trash, but it's highly energetic and manic trash that's never boring, despite its shortcomings.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

26,callanvass,A headache inducing farce that has no business being a sequel to a classic,3,22 February 2014,"D.J Vantia ""Stretch"" Block is hosting a radio show when she is disturbingly interrupted by two sadistic hoodlums. Things get serious when sounds of a chainsaw and gunfire commence. It turns out, Leatherface is on the prowl and kills the two pranksters. Stretch smartly has the evidence recorded on tape. She decides to present it to a disgruntled Lieutenant Lefty Enright. He turns her down at first, but changes his mind. He convinces her to play the tape, hoping the killers will take the bait. I'm just gonna say this right from the outset. I detest this sequel. I wouldn't call the original a favorite of mine, but it definitely deserves it's reputation as a bona-fide horror classic. I'm really beginning to believe Tobe Hooper was a fluke (No. Poltergeist doesn't count) He hasn't made a decent movie since that one. This one is a cannon production, dooming it before it even began. Cannon has made some entertainingly cheesy pictures (Including one of my favorite movies Bloodsport) but to try to replicate the success of the original was a ludicrous idea. This is full off loud black comedy that gave me a headache. Too many things are for comedic effect in lieu of the terror we received in the original. A lot of people seem to like the opening to this movie, but I found it to be stupid. The first time I watched this movie, I knew I was in for a long 100 minutes or so after that opening. One thing I don't get, is why they didn't do a followup from Marilyn Burns character from the original. I would have love to see if she was over the ordeal or if she had become as nutty as a fruitcake from the incident. Instead of that, we get a half-cooked sequel that feels all jumbled. There is some gore. We get a head sawed in half, somebody is beaten viciously with a hammer, nasty human faces, self-inflicted lacerations and more. Dennis Hopper is by far the best thing about this movie. Purportedly, he hated this movie. This is probably why he hammed it up like no tomorrow and decided to have some fun with it. As a result, I had fun watching him as a chainsaw welding maniac. Wait until you see the scene where he buys a few chain saws. Caroline Williams has great lungs and can scream with the best of them. She did well with what she had to do. Bill Johnson is OK as Leatherface. I'm sorry, I don't think a guy like Leatherface should be falling in love. Bill Moseley never shuts up and annoyed the living hell out of me. I was begging for somebody to shut his trap. Jim Siedow is a caricature of his character from the first one, yelling way too much as well. (03.14.14) Update! I completely forgot that they explained in Texas Chainsaw Massacre III that Sally died in 1977 in a health care facilityFinal Thoughts: If you're gonna view this, consume a few beers before watching this one.

Add to that Dennis Hopper as a former US Marshall who is as crazy as the family themselves and you have a the recipe for a gory riot.Trouble is I couldn't take it seriously, it simply didn't feel like a TCM movie!

33,insomniac_rod,He's the Lord of the Harvest!,8,27 July 2006,"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" is a sui generis Horror movie, it's a whole different take on the TCM 1974 version from the black humor - Horror point of view. This sequel shares the most important situations with the original, like the ""torture"" dinner scene, and Leatherface's attacks.This time our favorite cannibal family escaped from their ""secret"" location to hide once again but this time in an abandoned Texas amusement park in order to continue their murder spree. But this time someone is hunting them down for various reasons. Lt. ""Lefty"" Enright, uncle of Sally and Franklin from part 1 wants to take revenge against the murderers of his relatives (techically Sally didn't die but it's never explained what happened to her until part 3). Lt. Enright is not alone because he has the Lord by his side, situation that offers many hilarious non-sense Christian/Catholic references when he's about to face evil. ""Lefty"" tracks down the Sawyers (yes, that's their last name, pretty clever! Sawyers = Saw) after Leatherface and Chop-Top provoked the accident and death of two drunken snobs. Unfortunately for the Sawyers, the murder they committed was broadcasted live on local radio. Thanks to the hot DJ Stretch and her ambition to get on prime time radio, Lefty manages to find the hidden location of our beloved cannibal family. After a series of unfortunate events for Stretch and L.G., Lefty faces the clan and takes his revenge in the name of God.As you can notice, if you haven't seen the movie, the plot surrounds Lefty's revenge and the new torture mechanics of the Saywers. But TCM 2 is more than that. This movie is filled with unique black humor and great gore. The scene where Chop Top smashes L.G.'s head with a hammer is a classical moment in 80's splatter manners. First, Chop Top hits him repeatedly with the hammer and yells ""Nam flashback!"", or ""incoming mail!"", then he takes the -presumably- dead body and escapes with Leatherface who minutes before sexually attacked (in a bizarre way) Stretch. The second scene of L.G.'s death is better. It's a confusing black humor moment with many blood! We see Leatherface ripping L.G.'s face with a knife and then puts in over Stretch's face, while they dance around. After that, L.G. still alive tries to help her to escape, and in a very weird scene it's implied that he wants to stab her with a knife.. it doesn't happens. That scene explains the whole TCM 2 concept : a bizarre Horror movie that mixes black humor.The whole Lefty dialogs are hilarious and cool at the same time. Lines like ""Lord, you show me the way, help me beat this stranger that was beside me"" , as he watches a creepy sculpture, is a weird moment in the series. Lefty displays these kind of lines through all the movie. The Christian-Catholic lunatic who takes revenge in the name of the Lord is truly a bad-ass. He manages to take down the whole Sawyer family except for Chop Top, who later finds his demise after a struggle with Stretch.Tobe Hooper apparently lost his mind or smoked something while making this movie but I really thank him for coming up with a version of TCM that has NOTHING to do with the original TCM that we love. Hooper mixed gore with humor and excellent performances. Bill Moseley delivers a memorable performance that has paved the road for actors who mix Horror with black humor. The man steals the show. He's violent, hilarious, aggressive, lunatic.. the man is a true talent. Dennis Hopper delivers also a weird but brilliant performance as the bad ass Texas ranger who keeps singing ""born in the noontime growing seeds of kindness , brining in the sheaves""... He's the best character to face the Sawyers in the whole series. Jim Siedow also delivers a fine, hysterical performance. Die hard fans love the man. He's excellent in both TCM movies. Bill Johnson delivers a new performance for Leatherface with goes with the tone of the movie. An okay performance. Caroline Williams also gives a perfect performance and the fact that she's hot doesn't hurt! Watch TCM 2 to witness one of the best Horror comedies of the past 20 years. This movie won't let you down in the gore or entertaining factor. Some fans of the original seem to have this sequel but I think that it deserves a chance as a stand alone version of the 1974. I'm a huge fan of both and I watch them as two different movies even that they share the same characters and almost same situations.TCM 2 is a clear example of the greatness of 80's Horror.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
34,Anonymous_Maxine,Dog will hunt!,3,3 November 2004,"Disclaimer: Do NOT try to remove your hemorrhoids with a chainsaw. It will NOT save you a trip to the hospital.(spoilers) OK, let me tell you why the Texas Chainsaw sequels don't work. The original film is slightly exempt from this, but when you have someone who is screaming and wiggling so much that you wish she would just get killed so she'll shut the hell up, you have lost your ability to scare. Doesn't matter how good the sets or costumes or actors are, if the audience is holding their ears, you have a problem.The first sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is meant to be nothing other than a bigger version of the original, this time fictionalized, and beefed up with the star power of Dennis Hopper. Not that the original was non-fiction. As you know, it was really based, very loosely, as it were, on the inhuman antics of Ed Gein in the 1950s, the same demented nutcase that inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. Sounds like a fun guy.Unfortunately, as is all too often the case with horror movies, this one comes off more as a sick comedy than a scary movie. Granted, there are horror movies that purposely come out like that, such as most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a movie that caught people off guard because of its simplicity, its unknown cast, and its rough, documentary feel. In Texas Chainsaw 2, every single little bit of that is lost.The set, once we eventually get underground, looks like they rented the Indiana Jones set, festooned it with randomly placed naked light bulbs, furniture made out of human bones, and meat hooks, and had Leatherface run around swinging a chainsaw. The atmosphere of the movie has completely lost the claustrophobic feel of the original by vastly expanding the size of the set, much of which looks like a Christmas tree crossed with an esophagus, and there is just too much hooting and hollering for it to be scary. The only thing more irritating than the killers is their victim, 'Stretch.'The movie starts off with a couple of high school caricatures zooming down a desert highway, screaming at each other at the tops of their lungs about the sheer magnitude of the party that they are on their way to. They decide to swing into oncoming traffic to play chicken with someone driving a pickup truck, instantly making me eager to see them get killed. Doesn't matter that Leatherface is in that truck, anyone who plays chicken with a random driver because they're driving around drunk deserves to get killed. And if it takes place in a movie, they deserve to get killed with a chainsaw.So not only do we have to endure the hooting and hollering of these two jerks, but they call a radio station and we are asked to believe that this station's phones get completely tied up if someone calling in refuses to hang up. Sure, this is rural Texas and 1986, but are we to believe that even out there and back then, there were radio stations with a single phone line and without the ability to cut off the callers? At one point the clueless tech guy is frantically pushing buttons and pulling levers, trying to figure out how to clear the line. Given something so stupid, however, you know it was there for a reason, so that they could record the phone call as the kids get chainsawed on the other end. Speaking of which, the same kid that swerved into oncoming traffic at full speed finds himself stopped on a bridge as that same pickup truck sits blocking both lanes, and he frantically screams 'Are you crazy?!?' out the windshield while his idiot friend in the passenger seat offers such heroic tips as 'Just keep driving!' and 'Get outta here!' Good thinking'! Speaking of driving, not only can they not outrun a pickup truck traveling in reverse while supposedly holding the pedal to the floor in their Mercedes, but in the shots that show Leatherface standing and swinging his chainsaw, they are literally traveling all of 5mph.Dennis Hopper plays the uncle of the kids who were killed in the original movie, sort of a rogue detective out of his jurisdiction and showing up at the scene of the two kids' murder. The police refuse to jump to conclusions, but Lefty (Hopper) is sure that it's the same people who killed his nieces and nephews. Hopper makes a GREAT redneck. I generally am truly disappointed when actors take on fake accents, but Hopper does this one so well that you would swear he's lived in the south his entire life, it's just too bad that he's saddled with this idiot character.At one point, Stretch, the radio station DJ, shows up at his apartment, which, needless to say, is flooded with drunken rednecks wandering the halls with their arms around each other, and tells him that she has an audiotape of the murder because the kids called in just before they were attacked, and he sends her away! What the hell is that? Later he has a change of heart, but only wants to hear it if she'll play it on the air. The logic of the characters' actions in this movie is not starting off on the right foot. Then later, as Stretch hangs in a pit about to fall into the demons' lair, you might say, he tries to save her with a brittle, dried out arm bone. Clever.There is a lengthy horror scene inside the radio station, which looks like it doesn't know if it's supposed to be a radio station or a horror movie set, so better just be a little bit of both. It's got its vast storage of records stored safely behind an open door, with a heavy steel door guarding the cleaning supplies. A burglar's dream, you might say. We get a scene where Leatherface is assigned to kill Stretch, but when he finally gets through that steel door, he starts chainsawing a tub of soda cans sitting in ice, which have no reason for being there or for being chainsawed, until finally Stretch screams, 'Are you mad at me??' and my eyes glaze over for the remainder of the film.There's an effective scene where Leatherface puts Stretch's friend's freshly removed face over hers, supposedly to help her escape, but for the most part the underground portion of the film is a tired rehash of the original. Sure, it's bigger, there are more Christmas lights and more chainsaws, but essentially it's exactly the same thing, just without the surprise. They even replay exactly the same dinner scene from the end of the last movie, the most unpleasant scene in the entire movie. Lefty decides that he is so intent on delivering swift poetic justice that, rather than stock up on as many guns as he can carry, he buys three huge chainsaws and straps them to his body, and then runs screaming into the house, yelling and cutting down wooden supports as the family tortures Stretch. In Commando Arnold bulldozes into a weapons store and loads up on boatloads of guns and knives and explosives. In The Terminator he does the same thing, with the added bonus of killing off the proprietor before leaving. Lefty could have paid homage to both of those films, establishing Lefty as a good guy since he actually paid for his. But why saws and not guns? The grandparents, as is to be expected, are a hideous, hideous spectacle. Grandpa's 137 years old and still likes to hammer young girls on the head, and grandma spends her time in a wheelchair upstairs with a chainsaw on her lap. We are treated to a finale atop a huge rock outcropping that is so fake that it almost turns the movie into a comedy all by itself. There is at least one or two shots where the underlying chicken wire is nakedly visible.We get some sort of variation on the ending of the original, since the conclusion is almost a mirror image, in that the girl becomes the chainsaw wielding maniac rather than looking at him out the back window of a passing motorist, but I'm not sure what line of discussion led to the conclusion that this would be a cool way to end the film. Is this supposed to be the setup for a sequel? The family's dead, but now there's this girl who has caught chainsaw fever and will now carry on the legacy?",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
35,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The sequels!,8,15 October 2004,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1985) was the first sequel documenting the Sawyer family. Tobe Hooper made a cheesy and gory movie that's not meant to be taken seriously. Unfortunetlly, many people and critics unwisely compared it to the original and it didn't do as well as it should have. The filmmakers had more money and better special effects to play with. They took full advantage of it and made a true pop culture classic.The cook, Leatherface and Chop top (hitcher's twin brother) are all part owners of a chili and barbecue business. The Cook is the only one who makes public appearinces (he's the only normal looking one of the trio). Dennis Hopper makes a return to Hollywood in this film playing himself (he's been doing that a lot during this time period). A fun movie filled with buckets of blood and grue. The performances are over the top and the writing is witty and full of one-liners and groaners.if you love the first film then you'll enjoy the sequel. Tobe Hooper is still the man and he can make an excellent film whenever he wants to (and if he has a decent budget). The first of his three Cannon Films productions. All three of them are excellent and worth watching (too bad the company went bankrupt and collapsed). Highly recommended.A+Tobe Hooper makes a cameo appearance as an angry hotel guest",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
36,atinder,Not the worst in the series,4,2 July 2011,"This basically makes a mockery of what the first film was all about. I am of those who fell in love with the original and hail it as one the best horror movies out there.This movie did have really good opening scenes the two teenagers in Car calling up Radio station and having run, they are cut and they call again few hours later and they heard screaming on Radio as Leatherface is killing them. (This has some good amount of gore in that scene.That was only worth watching scene from the whole movie, I did not like anything after that scene, rest of the movie just flat and I hated Leatherface in this movie as was he like teenager in love or something.The from the whole cast in this movie is Not great but really good, the acting dose a lot worse after this sequel.I did not really understand the ending of this movie all, it shame it didn't carry on to next one.This movies is a least worth watching once4 out of 10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
37,drownnnsoda,Lousy Follow-Up To A Landmark Horror Film.,5,27 August 2004,"When I saw Tobe Hooper was directing this, I was thinking ""Okay, this should be decent, it's the director of the original"". Boy was I wrong. This movie didn't seem like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film at all, it was just some plain, corny, gory flick. One reason is because a lot of it was taken place in a radio station, so the isolation and helplessness that all the other films contain is gone. It seemed like half the movie is Leatherface and ChopTop chasing this radio host around the radio station, which got old really quick. Then it turns out the family's home is a maze of caverns that was formerly a Texas state national park, each tunnel being decorated with lights, furniture, and corpses. The biggest problem that I have with the film though, is that it lost all similarities with the original film, which I consider to be the best horror film of all time. It's much more comical, and much less serious. The powerful, grainy, realistic aura of the original film is completely lost, this film is more of a quirky freak show of the Sawyer family. It doesn't match up with the terrifying original.Bottom line is, Mr. Hooper lost what the rest of these films had - the sense of isolation in the Texas country, and the serious, realistic attitude that made the original movie so scary. This film is in my opinion the worst sequel of the series. If you're going to see this, just don't expect anything close to the original. I think that may be the reason I didn't like it as much, I had no idea that it was so different. 5/10.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

It's seems that Hooper wanted to make fun of his original film and make it different. Dennis Hopper did definitely did this film for the money but Hopper seems to be enjoying himself in some scenes.

39,dworldeater,The Buzz Is Back!,10,12 January 2017,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a great horror sequel and is one of my favorites in the genre. The film is totally bonkers and as such is a black comedy splatter masterpiece. Chainsaw 2 is a great follow up to the first film and is much different. The story continues with The Sawyer family. There is not only large doses of dark humor, but also heavy helpings of state of the art gore.(courtesy of F/X master Tom Savini) The film is completely insane and very unique blood splattered entertainment. Bill Mosley gives a legendary over the top performance as lunatic Chop Top. Dennis Hopper also gives an iconic performance as revenge seeking Texas Ranger Lefty Enright, which is also one of my favorite performances of his. The film has great quotable dialouge and is a very creepy, brutal and hilarious horror classic. Chainsaw 2 is one of my all time favorites and is essential viewing for horror fans.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
40,Witchfinder-General-666,Great Sequel to the Brilliantly Gruesome Original,7,19 July 2007,"Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" of 1986, may not reach the genius of the ground-breaking original 1974 original, but nevertheless, it is a great, blood-soaked, and often funny Horror flick. While the original TCM was one of the purest Horror films ever made, the sequel is more of a black Horror Comedy that occasionally borders slapstick. Nonetheless, it delivers genuine creepiness, delightful gore, and many other great qualities. Number one: Dennis Hopper. Who else could fit in the role of a hard-boiled cynical Texas Ranger as Hopper does. One must give it to this sequel that some scenes are really as morbid as one should hope, and some sequences really are hilarious.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!Vantia 'Stretch' Block (Caroline Williams), who hosts a Rock'n'Roll program on a Texas radio station, is annoyed when two drunk idiots call her show and refuse to hang up the phone. Things quickly get interesting, when the two callers are sawed apart by our friend Leatherface and his freak brother on a freeway while live on air. Hoping for a jump in her career, Stetch decides to show the macabre tape to Lieutennant 'Lefty' Enright (Dennis Hopper), A Texas Marshall and uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who had been victimized by Leatherface and his demented cannibal family in the 1974 film. Lefty has been hunting the cannibal maniacs ever since, desperately following any clue...As mentioned above, the casting of Dennis Hopper is one of this movie's best qualities and his character Lefty is responsible for most of the film's strongest and most hilarious scenes. I also liked Caroline Williams as southern beauty Stretch, she may not be the best actress ever, but she was the perfect scream-queen for this movie, as far as I am considered. Lou Perryman plays the redneck radio station assistant LG way over the top, but this is exactly what fits in here.Both Leatherface and his equally crazy brother are played by different actors than in the first movie, the only cannibal family member played by the actor from the original, is the family's sleazy and disgusting father who has in the meanwhile become an award-winning cook (due to 'quality meat'), played by Jim Siedow again. The fact that Leatherface is played by Bill Johnson instead of Gunnar Hanson doesn't make much of a difference, since he's wearing his lovely face mask all the time anyway. Ken Everett, who plays Leatherface's brother Chop Top does quite a good job being an extremely creepy and disgusting freak. Chop Top, who is obviously what the equally disgusting hitchhiker from part one (then played by Edwin Neal) has become, is great fun to watch, especially for his morbid and disgusting habits. Many things have changed since 1974, the cannibal family's morbid little house has somehow turned into a huge cave palace of necrophilia, for example.The great gore effects are another quality, which doesn't surprise since Gore-icon Tom Savini was responsible for make up and effects.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" doesn't equal the innovative brilliance of the 1974 Classic, which was, without doubt, a milestone in Horror movie history, but it is a highly entertaining mix of nasty Horror and black comedy. People should definitely see the original before seeing Part 2. As far as I am concerned, the sequel is a must-see for Horror fans.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
41,aidanratesmovies,What a mess,2,24 September 2021,"Incredibly loud, gorey, and absurd- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre tries to take a very different stab at its cannibalistic family of characters- with somehow even worse success than last time. I honestly hated this movie, which surprised me- not just because I hoped for a better film after being disappointed with the first one- but also because the beginning actually had promise. Sure it's campy, but the opening to this film was actually fun to watch- unlike the rest of it- which is just pure rubbish. The last hour and 10 minutes of this film are absolutely treacherous to watch as the pacing changes drastically and becomes a total mess of a film. Moments seem improvised and run on too long, the cinematography is horrendous and its obsession with showing as much gore and grossness as possible gets old real fast. The acting from Caroline Williams isn't horrible, but her oversexualized and thinly written character hardly makes for a compelling protagonist- and the supporting actors are honestly quite a chore to watch act on screen- especially Bill Moseley who is just about the most annoying character i've ever witnessed in a film. Jim Siedow is also quite horrible in his role, and even though he doesn't have quite as much screen time as the other cannibal characters- he does manage to bring the worst to every scene he is a part of. In the end, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 could have been something fun at the very least- but instead its an absolute trash heap of a film and one I hope to never sit through a minute of ever again.My Rating: 2/10.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
42,TOMNEL,"Though it gets progressively stupider, this still manages to be entertaining throughout.",6,28 September 2008,"Dennis Hopper as a crazy cop who doesn't care what anyone thinks, and wants revenge for the death of his nephew, now is on the trail of Leatherface who's back 14 years after the first film. This is what the back cover wants you to think this movie is about, and though it's technically true, it's stretching also stretching the truth a bit. Dennis Hopper is first credited, and is in the movie, though his screen time probably amounts to 15 minutes or less in total, with a character introduced to be the protagonist, but ending up just being a supporting actor. This has no affect on the quality of the movie, but a little more Dennis Hopper would have been appreciated.It's been 14 years since the first murderous mayhem of the first film, and now after an unexplained decade plus of no killings, Leatherface and his wacky family are back. Two kids are killed while calling in to a radio show, and the host, ""Stretch"" (Caroline Williams), has it on tape. She wants the police Lieutenant ""Lefty"" (Dennis Hopper) to listen to the tape, so he suggests she plays it. This attracts Bubba ""Leatherface"" Sawyer (Bill Johnson) and his crazy brother Bo ""Chop Top"" Sawyer (Bill Moseley) and they come to the radio station to pay Stretch a visit. Chaos ensues and it's up to Stretch and Lefty to save the day, and themselves.The acting is pretty good for what it is. Caroline Williams is fine at acting scared and Dennis Hopper is good at acting like he knows what he's doing. Everyone else is over the top crazy, which is stupid, but produces many laughs. The direction is quite good and clear, with well done action scenes. It's the writing that fails. The script gets stupider and stupider as it goes along and by the end the intelligence of this already mentally deficient is completely gone.This was very unique for a slasher film, in that it wasn't even a slasher. There was some violence, but there are really only two characters, so thank goodness it wasn't a slasher, because it would have been the shortest one of all time.Why does everyone have a nickname? Lefty, Stretch, Chop Top, Leatherface, Grandpa...why must every character be called by a nickname? Talk about repetitive writing.Overall, this isn't very good, but it's also not too bad. It's your average horror film, and a worthy follow up to the first film.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. R for violence and language.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
43,a_chinn,"Decent sequel is wildly different from original, but also the same.",6,7 May 2017,"Disappointing sequel to the classic original film is still good, but nowhere as shocking or frightening as the original. This sequel catches up with the Sawyer family years later, now hold up in an abandoned amusement park. The story goes through the story paces of the original, with the film's heroine having to endure seeing friends killed, a demented dinner scene, strange interactions with Leatherface, and an eventual escape. The big difference between this film and the original is that writer/director Tope Hooper focuses a lot more on black comedy, which was certainly an element in the original, but it's much more in the fore than it was in the original film. This sequel also features a tremendous amount of gore courtesy of special effects legend Tom Savini (that's either a good thing or a bad thing depending upon your perspective), which actually earned this film an X-Rating upon it's initial release. Another added comic element is Dennis Hopper playing a crazed Texas Ranger who's hot on the heels of the Sawyer family and looking for revenge because he's related to wheelchair bound Franklin from the first film. Bill Moseley is a real standout as Chop- Top and is probably the most memorable part of this film (and I'd forgotten that his line ""Dog will hunt!"" was sampled in a Primus song). Overall, this film is is pretty entertaining for horror fans, though nowhere as scary as the original film.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
44,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Another average horror sequel that has good and bad parts with a bittersweet aftertaste,5,1 February 2015,"Sequels in general are hard not to be ignored and they are also very well known for not satisfying audience's expectations. So far though, horror film franchises are the most prone to failing at being better than their initial entry in cinema. For one reason, it's understandable if the founder left the project entirely because then the sequel may not be in the best hands to carry the story. That's not the case here. Director Tobe Hooper, the man behind the first movie comes back to direct his long awaited sequel that almost seems like he forgot what made his original so horrifyingly stimulating. But he didn't forget, Hooper admitted that he wanted this entry to be less serious. And for what it shows, in some ways it is goofy but its dark humor doesn't always save it.Taking place 14 years later, audiences are introduced to Lefty Enright (Dennis Hopper), a man looking to find the cannibalistic Sawyer family who killed his brother's kids and friends from the first movie. To Lefty's dismay, trying to convince the police that the killers exist hasn't been going well. Fortunately for him, he meets a radio host named Stretch (Caroline Williams) who happened to record one of their killings over a live broadcast. With that, Lefty asks Stretch to help him make the public aware of the current threat. As an entry continuing the story, it does have some key moments that show thought did go into it, but overall there's less plot than before. Of what seems to be a subplot to expose the Sawyer family is then abruptly dropped for Dennis Hopper going on the hunt himself. What was even the point of making him apart of the police department if he decided he was going take matters into his own hands?There are some intriguing moments that screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson does include in this entry but not much of it feels completed. For continuity sake, Carson accomplished that. He not only makes reference to the original verbally but physically as well so that shows he had the right idea. As an interesting token, Carson also sheds some light on the Sawyer family. Specifically, that Drayton Sawyer (Jim Siedow, the 'ol pop) is a renowned chili cook. This is some of the dark humor because the audience realizes what Drayton belongs to but the characters don't. Another weird side note is that audiences get to see Leatherface actually display what almost seems like a little more humanity than before (almost). This key moment occurs whenever Leatherface is around Stretch. It's these elements that show Carson had some appealing ideas but only some of these character threads are fully realized. There are still some things that don't make sense though. An example of this is Bill Moseley, who successfully replaces Edwin Neal's role as the hitchhiker. How'd he get so horrid looking? No explanation for that. Dennis Hopper as Lefty isn't all the most believable because of his straight face performance. However, there are times where he blows a gasket and it's entertaining to see. Caroline Williams as Stretch doesn't play much of a memorable character. She does show some courage at times, but mostly she's screaming widely to the point of ridiculousness. Although Jim Siedow was the only original actor to return for the Sawyer family, the entire group still acts as if they were apart of the first movie. Bill Moseley copies Edwin Neal's performance nicely, Siedow had no trouble reconnecting with his original character and Bill Johnson who replaces Gunnar Hansen as Leatherface still looks terrifying. The camera-work was largely forgettable throughout. With an extended running time by 17 minutes from the original, there were only a couple shots that look good with the lighting. Everything else was a rather mishmash of ideas. It's as if Tobe Hooper didn't have much of a direction on how he wanted anything to look this time.The only other good aspect to this horror film is the violence. With practical effects master Tom Savini helping, the kills are bloodier and the props are much grosser. Gorehounds should enjoy the grossness. As for scariness, it's not much of scarefest because audiences have a clear idea of what the Sawyer family is all about. The music provided again by Tobe Hooper and additional composer Jerry Lambert doesn't waste time in ditching the atmosphere so cleverly crafted from the original. Instead of incorporating bonesaw noises, chicken squawks and what sounds like clanging kitchen tools, has been replaced with the all around generic synth piano. The notes are frantic to induce panic and scares but because there's no atmosphere to the tune, it sounds largely uninspired and bland. Even for its conclusion, which felt rushed to begin with, feels almost nonexistent or effective in its delivery. Like other average horror sequels, it has a number of scenes that proved its writer had the ideas but could not completely stitch them together properly. The lead actors are middling in their performances, the music has no atmosphere and the story has a thinner plot than the last. The only things worth mentioning are its ability to still be gross in its visuals and the minor unfinished character threads.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
45,vengeance20,Sucked,1,9 October 2012,***Contains Spoilers***After watching this sequel I was absolutely thrown back by miles! It was totally crap & also a massive spin off after the speech at the beginning of the film which gave somewhat of an indication that it was continuing the story line from the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. It was just terrible & I wouldn't recommend you see this as it literally just didn't look scary or even sinister. It wouldn't have bothered me so much if they didn't make it look stupid & more of a comedy. Even if it meant completely different characters it wouldn't have been so bad as long as it was done in the same style as the first.All in all terrible film.,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
46,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Better than its reputation has it,6,5 November 2008,"While nowhere near as good as the original, this much maligned sequel is better than a lot of people claim. After fourteen years, the chainsaw killers have relocated from south Texas to Dallas area, and are now ... wait for it, wait for it ... the most popular caterers in town, having even won an annual chili cook-off two years running, with their ""unique"" recipes of meat. When a couple of drunken, idiot college students crank call a late night disc jockey on a local radio station immediately before being sliced and diced by the chainsaw killers, and the DJ records audio of the killing (shades of Blow Out?) Enter Dennis Hopper who, while overacting outrageously, convinces her to play the tape of the killing on-air to draw the killers out into the open, against the advice of the station manager with the phlegm problem. Unfortunately, that's where the plot runs out, and, after a good first half, the pacing slows to a crawl in the second half, and it was also undermined by a rushed post-production schedule, which allegedly prevented further editing and effects-work. This was intended to be a satire of Motel Hell (which was a satire of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) complete with climactic dueling chainsaws, and the over-the-top slasher movies so popular in the 1980s, which is not entirely successful, but holds up better than a lot of the films from that time, and really captures the late night radio/ cable television feeling of the mid/ late 1980s. Our introduction to Chop-Top, both genuinely creepy and intentionally funny, was probably the best scene in the movie, very well done. It seems almost like something out of a David Lynch movie. The final scene has the heroine yelling and waving a chainsaw, after having dispatched the last(?) of the chainsaw family, just as Leatherface did at the end of the first movie. She had become exactly what she was fighting, and then, oddly, the movie ends with a bubbly little pop tune played over the closing credits, which should have been a sign to people that this was not intended to be taken seriously, as a straight sequel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but basically a satire based on itself.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
47,slayrrr666,A Classic in every sense of the word,10,30 December 2006,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" is easily the best entry in the series.**SPOILERS**After a series of accidents on the highways, Lieutenant 'Lefty' Enright, (Dennis Hopper) fears a repeat of before, and DJ Stretch, (Caroline Williams) and her producer L.G. McPeters, (Lou Perryman) come forward with evidence in the case. Trusting his instincts, he gets her to play a tape of one incident over the radio which attracts the attention of Chop-Top, (Bill Moseley) and Leatherface, (Bill Johnson) to the station. Stumbling upon their hiding place with leader Cook, (Jim Siedow) she is held captive in a massive underground lair until Lefty mounts a rescue effort to get her back. Deciding to also settle an old vengeance against the family, he fights to both set her free and settle his score.The Good News: This really surprised me with how good it really was. One of the greatest things about it is that it has a fun atmosphere present. From the simple storyline to the amount of action to the sick displays around at the ending, this movie simply screams good time. Right from the opening chase scene, where the family chases and chainsaws a car and the passengers traveling along a highway bridge, it sets an incredibly ominous tone that is equally spread throughout the rest of the movie. The attack in the radio station is one of the highlights, due to the fact that practically everything happens in there that could possibly happen. There's a great chase through the library stacks, great gore with a kill involving a hammer to the head, one of the best jumps possible where Leatherface comes roaring out the darkness with chainsaw blaring and one of the greatest and most suspenseful scenes in the genre. Trapped in a room with a large ice-chest, the attacker stops when he realizes the victim is covered in ice water. What happens afterward is incredibly sexual and very tense, but the fact that a chainsaw is present there makes it all the better and all the more memorable. There is another fantastically sick scene later on, where Leatherface, using an electric knife, slices off the face of one of his victims, takes it still dripping wet with blood, and places it over a characters face and proceeds to dance with them. It's great in it's concept and comes across as really disturbing and quite memorable. The gore in here is quite over-the-top and comes from so many great deaths. There's a guy bashed repeatedly in the head with a hammer, a guy who is still able to walk even though the skin of his face and other parts of his body have been peeled off, a throat slashing with a straight razor, a head chopped in half, and a chainsaw wound through the gut and out the back. There's piles of skinned corpses and body parts laying around on the floor, and with intestines stored inside a giant barrel, there's so much additional blood and guts on display in here. There is also a really spectacular underground labyrinth, which looks like the ruins of a hotel turned into a slaughterhouse with bizarrely placed corpses sitting under sun-lamps, at dinner tables, suspended on wires, all amid a bewildering maze of chandeliers and Christmas lights. Whenever the film is set there, it's impossible not to like it, and becomes another great factor about the film. What needs to be said about the chainsaw sword-fight at the end, which is really spectacular and brings a special extra to this. All in all, there is a large amount to like about this one.The Bad News: I really have a hard time finding stuff to dislike in here. This was a really enjoyable film that had tons going for it and really nothing I could find wrong. The one thing that even remotely bugged me was that the black comedy may not always be funny. It's such a change from the original that it's distracting to those expecting an all-out creep-fest. Other than this, there isn't anything in the film that's wrong.The Final Verdict: It was surprising how good this one actually was, and with so little against that's also very easily overlooked, this is one of the very best entries in the series and one of the better sequels made. Fans of the first one will love this one, and general horror fans will want to check it out as well.Rated UR/NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
48,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2""- A hilarious and off-beat horror-comedy...",8,30 August 2008,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" is director Tobe Hooper's (and writer L.M. Kit Carson's) sequel to the original horror classic, and is the cinematic equivalent of not sleeping for three days straight and then watching your favorite horror movie with a group of friends. You are not totally aware mentally, and everything washes over you in a new light, oftentimes with hilarious results.Yes, this time it is more comedy than horror, which I personally loved. While I hadn't seen the original at the time of seeing this entry, I was able to get right into the story.Basically, a radio host (the sexy Caroline Williams) and a Texas Ranger (Dennis Hopper... yes I said ""Dennis Hopper"") who happens to be related to a couple of the victims from the original film try to contend with Leatherface and his cannibalistic (and dementedly hilarious) clan. Well, I mean, there is more to the plot than THAT, but overall, that is what's most important in this film.The film is a slow-build, and it really isn't until the halfway point that it picks up and maintains a steady spiral into oblivion. But don't think the movie boring- writer Carson injects quite a bit of life into the story, and makes the characters fun and very interesting to watch. He also has an ear for dialogue and knows how to make even the most minor of moments shine. Never before would I think a line of dialogue such as ""Hey, I built you a french-fry house!"" actually make me like a character and root for him, but Carson's quirky character and Hooper's fun direction make it happen.But no review of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" is complete without a mention of the one character that everybody loves- Bill Moseley as ""Chop-Top"", a supposed Vietnam Vet and brother of Leatherface (or, as we learn his real name, ""Bubba"") with an exposed metal plate sticking out of his head (supposedly from a war-wound) and sickly pale skin. Yes, Chop-Top has some of the most amazing and gut-busting lines of dialogue I have ever heard, and Moseley shows his talent for acting, making him horrifying and hilarious at the same time. One of the best things to happen to Horror-Comedies ever.There are plenty of surprises in the story to keep you reeling, and great ""silly"" performances by talents like Hopper. Basically, once this movie gets going, it sucks you right in and won't let go.Oh, and it also has some great gore, and superb performances by the likes of Bill Johnson as Leatherface and Jim Siedow as the Cook Drayton Sawyer, among others.I can't help myself with this one- an 8 out of 10!",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
49,punishmentpark,"Sacrilege, again, but...",4,17 November 2014,"This review is a sequel to my review of 'Psycho II'... In a short period of time did I watch two sequels to movies I deem absolute classics in the horror genre. Why? I'm in the middle of working my way down a slasher list I found somewhere, and these came up. So now I find myself comparing sequels to originals, ánd sequels to sequels... But I'll stick to this one here, while I might add some to my review of 'Psycho II'.First off, this isn't a slasher, just a straight forward splatter movie - Tom Savini's work is thoroughly enjoyable once again. It's sort of a do-over of the original, with an added love interest for Leatherface and a somewhat religious Rambo cowboy seeking revenge for Franklin (remember?). The new 'farm' is a dilapidated amusement park, partly subterranean. And, yes, grandpa shows up, too, alive and 'well' and even big grandma is there. Hooper went all out to make it work, and it almost did... except for that 'damned' original - it's sacrilege, I tells ya! Still, there's fun to be had with the family's struggles and 'Stretch' stretching and screaming beyond limits (her final shot is a clever combination of Leatherhead's and Sally's finale in the original). Dennis Hopper's part was okay, nothing else.So here's 'leniency part two': 5 out of 10.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
50,capkronos,"A loud, hyped-up, hectic, gory mess...but still entertaining.",6,30 December 2003,"I might be stretching it a bit giving this critically blasted sequel 6 out of 10, but it deserves it for sheer audacity and entertainment value, not to mention the priceless performances, remarkable set design and great Tom Savini make-up FX, which were enough to deny this an R rating when released and cause some distribution problems.Dennis Hopper (who was in BLUE VELVET the same year!) turns camp king as Ex-Texas Ranger Lt. Lefty, brother of the Sally and Franklin characters from the original. He's out for revenge against the cannibal clan for what they did to his family, while radio DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams, who is a lot of fun) simply tries to survive after she airs a radio broadcast that p1sses them off. The psychotic father (who makes award winning chili out of human flesh), Leatherface and the 100-and-something-year-old grandpa are still around, plus new member Chop Top (Bill Moseley), who has a metal plate in his head, suffers from 'Nam flashbacks and does some disgusting things with a clothes hanger and a lighter. The cannibal clan hideout, which is hidden underground beneath an amusement park this time, is a marvel of skeletal decor, hooks, cobwebs, tunnels and blood oozing walls. In fact, everything about this movie is taken to insanely outrageous proportions, and it drops the straight horror and sly black humor of the original for more blatant shocks and in-your-face comedy, which explains the critical hatred. Nonetheless, I think TCM2 would be an enjoyable watch for most horror fans.The franchise continued with the disappointing LEATHERFACE (1989), the atrocious TCM: THE NEXT GENERATION ('94) and then the popular, and surprisingly watchable, 2003 remake of the original.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
51,PimpinAinttEasy,A precursor to House of 1000 Corpses .....,7,14 August 2016,"Dear Rob Zombie, I bet you were inspired by the antics of the redneck characters in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 when you wrote House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects. You made a truly great work of art with the Devil's Rejects. In its own way, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is also a great work of art. The nihilism of the psychopathic redneck family grates on your nerves after a while. Dennis Hopper appears and disappears. His alcoholic cop character deserved more space. Caroline Williams was easy on the eyes. It was too gross for a mainstream American film. I was not offended by the gluttony which the villains indulged in. But it did seem like the Tobe Hopper got carried away by the schlock. Not that it wasn't amusing. Bill Moseley was hilarious when he first confronts Caroline Williams. The two loud party goers were quite amusing and their make up was creative. The film's set design deserves special mention. Rob, you borrowed the worst attributes of this film and made a damn good movie with The Devil's Rejects.Best Regards, Pimpin.(7/10)",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
52,Maciste_Brother,Amazing Grand Guignol Horror Film!,8,5 January 2003,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 when it was released in theaters back in 1986. I loved this horror flick then. But everyone else hated it. Critics trashed it. Even many horror fans, of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre or slashers in general, hated it and dismissed it. Now after a decade or so after its release, TCM 2 is now a bona fide cult movie.There are so many things to point out why TCM 2 is a stand-out. The first and most important thing to point out is that back in the 1980s, horror films were reduced to simple slashers. TCM 2 is totally different than the plethora of slashers that many horror fans expected to see, which is one reason why many horror fans didn't get it. The body count is extremely low in TCM 2 compared to the Friday the 13th or Elm Street flicks. But that doesn't mean it's not violent. No, it's VERY violent. But the violence in TCM 2 is more engrossing, shocking and even at times funny, and in turn less acceptable than the unreal violence found in many slasher films. Because of the amount of violence and violent imagery, films critics trashed TCM 2, pointing out how the first film didn't rely on gore and violence to scare the audience.I love Texas Chainsaw Massacre as much as I love TCM 2. I understand what the critics were saying. Unfortunately, they didn't get the point of the violence in TCM 2. While TCM is a sweat inducing TERRIFYING horror film in the first order, TCM 2 is a ""GRAND GUIGNOL HORROR"" horror film in the first order. In TCM 2, Hooper creates a vast canvas of baroque imagery, where we watch the insane and gory story unfold before our incredulous eyes. I'm amazed that critics missed the whole difference between TCM and TCM 2. It's odd that critics will rave about Peter Greenaway's ""THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER"" which is a twisted drama in the the Grand Guignol style, but didn't see TCM 2 in the same way. It's probably due to the fact that TCM 2 is a sequel to a quasi-legendary horror film and everyone expected the sequel to be the same as the first movie.I give credit to everyone involved with TCM 2. They actually TRIED to do something different: different from the equally great TCM, different from the increasingly boring horror films of the 80s. And in my eye, they've succeeded. There are so many memorable scenes in TCM 2, some of which are the most amazing horror moments ever put on screen (when Leatherface tries to put the scalped face on Stretch, the scene when Stretch finds her friend sans face, etc). And there are so many quotable lines too. TCM 2 is also a very funny film (""Rain, rain, rain, rain..."" Choptop says as he checks out records at the radio station).TCM 2 is not perfect. The ending is abrupt. And the chainsaw fight at the end is too short. Dennis Hopper is a bit hard to take as a ""hero."" But he does play the ""twisted hero"" right. It's just difficult to see him fighting big and burly Leatherface. BTW, the very last image of TCM 2 is Strecth dancing with a chainsaw in her hands at the top of that amusement park structure. In the original film (and the original video release), we can see cars and trucks driving by on a highway in the distance. On the DVD, they cropped this shot and we don't see the traffic anymore. Personally, I thought it added a LOT to the whole surreal aspect of the film. Like the world was continuing on with its relentless pace, no matter what had just happened that night. I wished they didn't crop this shot on the DVD. Oh well...It's a shame few people ""got"" TCM 2 back then. After reading the reviews at IMDb and at Amazon, it's great to see that some are finally ""getting it."" For anyone who's game, watch TCM 2. You'll be squealing in horror and laughing at the insanity of it all in equal amounts.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
53,gedikreverdi,"It's extremely nasty, gory, bizarre and cheesy and I love it",8,7 October 2021,"It was gory, nasty, bizarre, sick and cheesy at the same time. Sally is the sole survivor and she's now catatonic and they couldn't find the macabre murder house. Lieutenant Lefty wanted to find out the cannibal family because the paraplegic guy that went missing in the previous film was his brother and the radio deejay Stretch wanted to help her with the calling record on tape of the two obnoxious boys that got killed by the cannibals with chainsaw while they were on the phone.The two ended up in the tunnels of terror in which our cannibal family lived. The scenes looked so macabre and amazing which is something I didn't expect. Bubba made her new deejay lover wear her workmate's face mask and then they re-enacted the same dinner scene with the immortal grandfather but the lieutenant showed up enraged after finding his brother Frankie's dead body in the wheelchair.We don't know what happened but the butcher man who looks more normal than bubba and the guy with a metal plate in his skull found a hand grenade and blew up the place. The deejay (who's a very bad actor btw) climbed the tower and at the top there was the grandmother and she killed the metal head and danced with the chainsaw.Although it was too cheesy at times but it was so gory, bizarre and weird and I even like it better than the first one.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
54,baumer,"too much weird, not enough chills and macabre",6,22 January 2002,"May be some small spoilersTobe Hooper and John Carpenter have proven over the years that they have one very definitive thing in common.  They both shocked the film world with one of their dark, and eerie takes on monsters and death and they have since struggled to live up to that sententious billing bequeathed upon them after their early success.  Carpenter has never quite managed to duplicate his stylized efforts of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, nor has Hopper managed to emulate anything near the panic and paranoia he introduced us to with Leatherface and his notorious saw in 1974.  Hooper's had valiant yet failed efforts with flicks like Poltergeist, Funhouse and Lifeforce, but his attempt to re-capture the fans predilection of the first Chainsaw Massacre with this vapid attempt is nothing short of a pure disappointment.Texas Chainsaw Massacre did something that very few films have been able to do.  It took you inside a killer's mind and a killer's dwelling and showed you the sheer audacity of their life and style.  No other villain, including Jason, Michael and Freddy can lay claim to this.  What Hooper has tried to do is further the story by taking you deeper into the family of these crazed people.  I think that on paper this must have looked like a good idea but when executed it comes off as insipid and dull.  We have probably all seen the first one, I can't imagine anyone seeing this film without having experienced the first, so what we see here is Hooper trying to give the audience some feel of the first.  There were many disturbing scenes in the first film and in this second one we revisit some of those scenes and in some cases those scenes are basically reinacted but with a different actress.  I can only assume Hooper was trying to propitiate his loyal fans but in the process he may just have alienated us.  Let's face it, Marilyn Burns will never be forgotten as Sally and long before Jamie Lee Curtis came around, Marilyn may have been considered the scream queen.  Here, Caroline Williams does her best Marilyn Burns impression and Hooper tries to recapture the horror of the dinner table scene but it just doesn't work. Many of the elements of the film don't work this time around and I think that is because for some reason you just know that there is help on the way. Somewhere, Dennis Hopper is lurking with his chainsaw and he is going to come to the rescue.  You know that grandpa is 137 years old and he is not going to have enough strength to whack the heroine over the head with the hammer.  Somehow you just know.  In the original, you didn't know.In the original, Sally was all alone.  She was her only salvation.  If she wasn't going to come to her own rescue then no one was.  You were scared f or her, you were terrified for her and you felt sympathy for her.  I really didn't feel anything for Stretch in this film.  I somehow just knew that she was going to get away.Comedy also makes this film a downer.  There are too many one liners in here and it looks as though Fred Krueger and The Sawyer family may have traded scripts after a while because what was nothing but frightening shots of sadistic people doing sadistic things is now more like a stand-up comedy than it is a horror film.Another problem is that Bill Johnson plays Leatherface and he is not nearly as intimidating nor is he as physical a presence as Gunnar was in the original.  Gunnar Hansen was a massive, mean looking guy and he frigthened me.  But here, he is more like a pussycat.  Not good for a film that was lionized in people's minds and opinion, due largely to Gunnar's portrayal of Leatherface.TCM2 is not all bad, there are some twisted scenes involving Caroline Williams and Bill Mosely, who plays Chop Top.  They share a chase scene that was trying to emulate the chase scene with Marilyn Burns and Edwin Neal from the original.  And while it was decent, again, it just falls short of it's target because we have seen it all before.All in all, this is a failing effort but it is worth seeing if you are a fan of the series.  The original is head and shoulders above this one and the third is quite a nice improvement, but just try to sit through this one and see what you think.  There are some nice homages to the first and you have to give Hooper credit for that....just not too much credit.5 out of 10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
55,IonicBreezeMachine,"While an almost complete tonal 180 from the first film, Tobe Hooper gives us a bloody entertaining time with viscera and laughs galore.",7,11 October 2021,"14 years after The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the murderous cannibal Sawyer family consisting of brothers Drayton ""The Cook"" (Jim Siedow), Chop Top (Bill Moseley), and Leatherface (Bill Johnson) have abandoned their isolated country hideaway and have taken their hunt for meat on the road. When a pair of the trio's victims calls into the radio station of radio D. J. ""Stretch"" (Caroline Williams) she ends up recording the sounds of chainsaws and gunfire. Eventually Stretch meets up with former Texas Ranger turned vigilante Lefty Enright (Dennis Hopper) who is hunting the Sawyer family for revenge for the death of his Nephew, Franklin and psychological trauma of his institutionalized niece Sally. Stretch shows Lefty the tape and while initially hesitant to team up, the two agree on a plan to broadcast the tape to trap the Sawyer family, with Stretch seeing this as an opportunity to make a name for herself. Eventually the plan works with Stretch caught in the middle between the crazed Sawyer family and the crazed Lefty who will take them down at any cost.The final of three films Tobe Hooper did for Cannon following the hit Poltergeist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (aka Part 2) was born from a cynical desire by producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus to just make a similar film to the last one but on a bigger budget. Tobe Hooper rather than make a straight horror film, made an elaborate darkly comic farce (originally to be titled Beyond The Valley Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The film was not well received by critics or audiences of the era with critics (again) lambasting the film for its violence and gore, while audiences didn't like the shift in tone from the gritty approach of the first film to something more comedic. Even Dennis Hopper at one point claimed this to be the worst film he'd ever been in (before changing it to Super Mario Bros. Later). While it was probably a mistake billing this as a ""part 2"" and would've been better served by being titled Beyond The Valley Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is such an audacious and ridiculous exercise in excess that it's honestly hard not to go along with it.From the opening with its more self-aware soundtrack and broad stereotypical chuckleheads ripping down a highway shooting at random signs, it's made clear this is not the same approach as the original. The movie takes itself about as seriously as a Tex Avery cartoon (albeit with more gore and lasting consequences) and the creativity that goes into the chainsaw based shenanigans is a sight to behold. Caroline Williams makes a great heroine bringing along with the typical scream queen prerequisites and acerbic wit and humor that fits well with the character, and Jim Siedow, Bill Moseley, and Bill Johnson are enjoyable as The Cook, Chop Top, and Leatherface making playing themselves like a gory sadistic version of The Three Stooges. But easily the best part is Dennis Hopper playing unhinged chainsaw wielding Texas Ranger, Lefty Enright, and Hopper doesn't just chew the scene, he chainsaws and devours it. Every moment Hopper is on screen the movie gets that little extra ""oomph"" that rises it from entertaining to schlocky b-movie epic, Hopper's performance in this movie is almost Ash in Evil Dead levels of over the top entertaining and that's not a statement I make lightly.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is best experienced if you know what you're in for. If you go in knowing this is more a funhouse mirror parody continuation on the first film you'll get what you paid for and then some. If you go in expecting a spiritually faithful follow-up to the original you'll be disappointed. While not every bit of the movie lands and the climax does drag a bit with some of the Chop Top based elements, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is an enjoyable entry in comedically skewed splatter films.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
56,mentalcritic,The first of many incompetent remakes...,1,13 April 2007,"In 1974, Kim Henkel and Tobe Hoober scraped together a bare amount of cash in order to film what would eventually be released as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. An odd title, to be sure, since only one of its characters was killed using a chainsaw, and four victims hardly constitutes a massacre. Still, in spite of being distributed to theatres on prints that barely looked better than the home videos that would appear later in the decade, Chainsaw became an almost instant cult classic, with viewers expressing amazement at how restrained the film seemed to be. Indeed, the original Chainsaw shows that in a clash between the power of suggestion and the power of gore, the former will always create a more horrifying film. Assuming one knows how to execute it properly, that is. Unfortunately, Chainsaw 2 is little more than an attempt to recreate a past glory with little regard to the circumstances of that success, or the changing circumstances that the mid-1980s had brought. One almost pictures a writer trying to tell Hooper and Carson that the days of the drive-in are over.It would be all too easy to blame director Tobe Hooper for the non-event that follows, but that would be taking the easy way out. Hooper had previously gone to glory with such works as Salem's Lot and Poltergeist, so one must wonder if the screenwriter is not to blame. In contrast to all the sequels and remakes that would follow, Chainsaw 2 attempts to vary the flow of the film a little by introducing a few unique locations and subplots. In so doing, however, it also creates a few questions that remain difficult to answer, even when one remembers the film was set in 1986. The ability of two men to storm a radio station and attack a DJ raises the question common to many a B-grade horror film, namely where the police presence is. To its credit, Chainsaw 2 more or less fails to follow the tired old cliché of lining up a group of interchangeable teens for the villain to chop to pieces. Instead, it follows a completely unhinged Dennis Hopper on a quest for revenge, and Caroline Williams on a senseless ride around various locations.One vital component of the original that none of the sequels or remakes have ever got right is Leatherface. In 1974, Gunnar Hansen created a character with a myriad of subtle micro-movements that terrified audiences as much with his bizarreness as his chainsaw. He was frightening because one could look at him and see that there once was a human being inside. By comparison, Bill Johnson, and every Leatherface that has followed since, was a robot. The repertoire consists of Walk To Point A, Chop Victim A, Walk To Point B, repeat. Whereas Hansen quite obviously delved into the mind of his character in order to create something three-dimensional, Johnson is just there. And this only serves to highlight how ineffective Jim Siedow, Bill Moseley, and Ken Evert are without a strong Leatherface. In the original, the men playing the family were incredibly creepy, and their dinner-table scene terrifying due to the dynamic they had with Leatherface. In Chainsaw 2's copycat dinner-table sequence, they are merely annoying.In another example of how the clash of cultures results in a weaker film, the helpless damsel portrayed by Marilyn Burns in the original is replaced in this sequel by a proto-feminist everyone keeps calling Stretch, portrayed here by Caroline Williams. Much like Marilyn, Caroline looks as if she would weigh a hundred pounds with sand filling all of her pockets. This is not a problem if one knows how to structure a story around the character, but Chainsaw 2 even proves a letdown in this regard. The most ridiculous scene in horror film history comes toward the end, when it becomes clear that writer L.M. Kit Carson is still asking how he can ape the glory of the original Chainsaw. After watching Gunnar Hasen's iconic chainsaw dance in the original, Carson apparently thought this would be a good scene to recreate with the heroine. Never mind that the original dance was done by a man who stands close to two metres tall and looks like he weighed about two hundred and fifty pounds naked. The result is a ridiculous shot in which the question on everyone's mind is whether Caroline is swinging that chainsaw, or whether the chainsaw is swinging her.And that is pretty much the problem that every sequel and remake to Chainsaw has suffered from. It does not help matters that in the same year, a sequel to a much higher-budget horror film took the story not only in a whole new direction, but into a whole different genre. Throughout the running time of Chainsaw 2, an amazing temptation to ask where we have seen all of this before keeps mounting. This must have proved incredibly frustrating to Tobe Hooper, who at this point was starting to fill his resume with a long list of trash. Nobody else here even proves remotely worth remembering, with even Dennis Hopper's performance coming off as recycled from somewhere else. When I read about the original idea Hooper and Henkel had for a sequel to Chainsaw, I honestly wish that I could have seen that particular project realised. Unfortunately, the 1980s soon gave way to a culture in which everything had to be played safe, and this meant the demise of innovation in all horror franchises. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is just an early example.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a one out of ten film. It gets four bonus points for the ridiculous attempt at a chainsaw dance, but loses three for all of the annoying or phoned-in performances that precede it. Definitely not a keeper.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

58,MrGKB,This is what sequels are meant to be...,7,1 May 2007,"...something that takes the original in new and interesting directions. ""TCM2"" does exactly that.I'm quite amazed at the poor rating of this highly entertaining dark comedy here on the IMDb. I can only imagine that ""TCM"" purists are offended by Tobe Hooper's refusal to duplicate the grimness of his original classic, thus the inordinately high percentage of ""1"" votes, but who can say? I note with interest the small cohort of females 45+yo who must all be friends of Scream Queen Caroline Williams, as well as the relative dearth of votes for this second entry in one of the most enduring franchises in the horror genre. Perhaps last year's DVD release will eventually help this title gain a few points as more people are exposed to this currently maligned piece of Grand Guignol.No matter. ""TCM2"" stands up quite nicely as a representative of the 80s zeitgeist, particularly in the form of Bill ""The Devil's Rejects"" Moseley's Chop Top, the whacked-out vet of the Sawyer family. Reams could be written regarding how his character reflects on the situation of Vietnam veterans a decade after the end of that benighted war, but this isn't the place. Suffice to say, Moseley blesses us with a memorable performance that outdoes Ed Neil's Hitchhiker in the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" ""TCM2"" is loaded with some classic imagery and setpieces that stick in the brain long after the film is over: Leatherface's probing of Stretch's superb legs and cutoffs-clad pudendum with his overtly phallic chainsaw; Chop Top's incessant and disgusting self-grooming; the patchwork skinning of L.G. McPeters (played by ""TCM"" assistant cameraman Lou Perryman with great likability) in all its gory glory; the subsequent mise-en-scéne with Stretch wearing L.G.'s face like a Halloween mask; Leatherface with a chainsaw through his gut, still mobile and dangerous; a maddened, triumphant Stretch doing the chainsaw boogie; and, just to top things off, one of the weirdest sets ever seen in a slasher film, comedy or no. Production values are remarkably high, centering on the awesome makeup fx work of splatterking Tom Savini, who was fresh off some amazing work on George A. Romero's ""Day of the Dead."" In addition to the above-mentioned actors, ""TCM2"" sports a somewhat restrained but still scene-chewing Dennis ""I am ubiquitous!"" Hopper as the vengeance-seeking, twin chainsaw-wielding ""Lefty"" Enright (get it?), who would soon be reveling in the notoriety of a trifecta of memorable performances (""Blue Velvet,"" River's Edge,"" and ""Hoosiers"") that would forever cement his reputation as one of the edgiest (and best) character actors in the business. Also of note is the return of Jim Siedow, the only carryover actor from the original ""TCM."" His portrayal of Drayton ""Cook"" Sawyer is a twitchy, cantankerous, picaresque marvel, and it's a shame he was never able to parlay it into a decent film career, although I'm sure the Houston theater scene is glad he didn't.Bottom line: if you're looking for a repeat of the original classic's nerve-wracking tension and horror, you'll be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you're willing to let auteur Tobe Hooper and his screenwriter, L. M. Kit ""Breathless"" Carson, have their way with taking Hooper's creation in a totally different but still demented direction, you will be amply rewarded. ""TCM2,"" unlike last year's dreadful ""prequel,"" should be a part of every gorehound's DVD collection.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
59,TOMASBBloodhound,More equals less.,4,5 October 2008,"A dozen years had passed since Tobe Hooper's classic film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was made. And you would have thought that Tobe and company would have had time to conjure up a worthy sequel. This time they'd have the money that would allow them just about anything they wanted to create on screen. But after watching this disaster, one cannot help but be reminded of the old adage that ""sometimes less is more"".The original film was shot in four weeks under brutal conditions and with a budget that must have run in the tens of thousands of dollars. This time the scale is larger, and most of it obviously shot on actual sets. Tom Savini was on board to provide some disgusting gore that the original lacked. They even had an experienced star like Dennis Hopper to give top billing to. How could this film have missed? Well first of all, the tone is more comedic than frightening. This film is not at all frightening, nor does it seem to be trying to be. The original had a few moments that may have provided a chuckle or two, even if by accident. But it is painfully obvious that nobody is really that concerned with scaring the audience here. Even back then, they had to have known that gore alone is not scary. At the most it only provides the audience with discomfort. So this sequel lacks the suspense, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and basically all of the tension packed into the original. Not a good way to go, Mr. Hooper.The cast is not bad. You wish Hopper would have a more carefully defined role than that of just an ex(?)-lawman trying to avenge the death of the wheelchair-bound Franklin from part one. Hopper was seeing a career resurgence at this time, and maybe they just figured he'd provide even more zaniness as he battles Leatherface chain saw to chain saw. Hopper would go on to state that this was the worst film he ever made. Jim Siedow is the only returning cast member from part one, and gone is the edginess from his earlier performance. He and Bill Moseley are only going for laughs. Bill Johnson is an active and menacing Leatherface, but here he's made into too much of a sympathetic character by the third act. Caroline Williams is decent enough. She appears to have had a physically demanding role, and she sure knows how to scream.Go ahead and watch this film if you must. Especially since the Red River football weekend is coming up very soon! But by the time these creeps are chasing Ms. Williams around the bowels of a deserted amusement park, you will be disappointed. You will miss the tension, the atmosphere, and most importantly the scares from part one. Tobe Hooper's career had begun to slip by this point, and this film did him no favors.

It is really impossible to top such a significant thing, and director Tobe Hooper knew that when he decided to go back to Texas for another adventure of the cannibal family.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" follows Stretch (Caroline Williams), a radio host in the limits between Texas and Oklahoma who one night tapes a phone call that is the first proof of the existence of the legendary maniacs of the infamous Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Without knowing what to do, she goes with Lieutenant ""Lefty"" Enright (Dennis Hopper), a retired cop who is on a personal hunt for the psychos as his nephews were killed by the cannibal clan 14 years ago. Lefty is decided to finish the Texas Chainsaw Massacre once and for all.Instead of attempting to repeat the magnitude of his masterpiece, Hooper decided to use a different approach to the movie turning it into a violent and unmerciful parody of the horror films of the 80s, complete with powerful gory violence and over-the-top set-pieces. Sadly, apparently nobody understood the joke and the film was bashed and unfairly ripped apart as many were expecting a movie on the vein of its predecessor. Still, the sequel works very well on its own terms and it is as entertaining as the first one is scary.With a superior budget and the aid of visual effects genius Tom Savini, Tobe Hooper is able to create powerful scenes of violence that pushes the boundaries of what was allowed on a mainstream feature of its time. Adding more black humor to the movie this ""Chainsaw"" is definitely a product of its time and while nowhere near to the scares of the haunting first movie, it makes up for that with pure sheer entertainment courtesy of Jim Siedow (returning as the Cook) and Bill Moseley as Chop Top. Leatherface (Bill Johnson) is back too and his role is extended showing Hooper's true intentions of having him as a somewhat innocent, but still dangerous and violent killer.It's obvious why the film may feel as a disappointment, as it relies more in comedy than in horror, but the story is cleverly devised and just as the first did, it makes an exaggerated and harsh critic to the dark aspects of American society. The over-the-top gratuitous violence contrasts with the subtler approach of the first one, but in the film's context is very appropriate. Savini makes a very good work and it is definitely one of his works of the 80s.Dennis Hopper and Caroline Williams are a bit average on the lead roles. Hopper makes a good interpretation but sometimes feels uninterested. Williams gets carried by the character and makes an exaggerated portrait of her role as ""scream queen"" in the movie. On the other hand, the cannibal family is at its best with Siedow completely owning the screen and Moseley in a very funny role that looks like the Hitchhiker of the first one completely on acid. Johnson as Leatherface is less menacing than Gunner Hansen, but actually that's what Hooper intended in this story, so it is safe to say that he did a good job for the most part.This sequel to the 70s masterpiece certainly will disappoint fans expecting a movie like the original, but those just waiting for a hour and a half of fun that doesn't take itself too seriously will find a terrific experience. Tobe Hooper may not be a great horror director, and he definitely won't be able to create another movie of the magnitude of his praised debut; but ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" is a fun quality flick that horror fans should not miss. 7/10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
61,stamper,The guy that did the original now brings me this?,3,9 June 2001,"I do not want to sound harsh, but this is total crap. This is not a good horror film and it is even worse if you consider it is a sequel to the GREAT Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is nor scary nor intense as was the first film. This is just bloody. Blood with which they try to make up for bad acting and directing. Making up for a cheap 1980's production of a film that can never be reached.STAY AWAY!3 out of 10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
62,The_Movie_Cat,"""I'm bringing it down!""",3,16 December 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSEighteen months ago I posted a review on the IMDb raving about how great the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (8) was. Since then I've seen it again and realised my initial opinion was wrong - it's even better. Most genre sequels are trash, but, with Part 2, it's rare to find one helmed by the same guy. Director Tobe Hooper was behind a classic in 1974, he's behind garbage here.
The original had artistic subtlety - this has a man driving a car at 90mph with a semi-severed head squirting blood in the air. 1974's underlying sense of devilish black humour is here promoted into incongruous, dumb-ass comic relief. The cannibals' home this time around is a vast underground cavern, adding a sense of the operatic grotesque. This sounds far better than it actually is, however, and it's quite rubbish on screen.
What's someone of Dennis Hopper's calibre doing in bilge like this, uttering lines like ""Hell. Hell's exactly what they raised""? When a film's classiest dialogue is ""lick my plate, you dog dick"" you know this isn't exactly a Shakespearean tragedy. Into this Hopper's character is projected as a detective figure, thrust into a world of hillbilly radio stations and 80s pop music. (The credits list a ten-song soundtrack). Helping Hopper is Caroline Williams as ""stretch"", who escapes harm time and again to be the heroine. As it's obvious from the start that neither she or Hopper will come to harm; every peripheral ""character"" merely potential victim, then there's no tension whatsoever. Sole interesting bit is when Williams falls down a hole, which reminded me of Alice, but was doubtlessly unintentional. Williams does do better than most in a film where all are encouraged to overplay, and not in a good way. Nice legs, too. It's still a pretty thankless role, though, and she never gets the chance to really lose herself in it like Marilyn Burns did.It's not scary; it doesn't even try to be. There's no atmosphere, no attempt at coherent storytelling. There's no isolation this time either, the cannibal family have taken to travelling to the bright, heavily populated city for their victims, which is nowhere near as dramatically compelling. And as the ""heroes"" don't function as victims, then the cannibals have no narrative function as villains. This time they're cast as loveable anti-heroes, with Leatherface given a minor part given that he doesn't speak. He's now played by Bill Johnson, who looks stupid in the role, and uses his titular saw as sexual suggestion. Freud need not be troubled.
Production values are actually fairly decent, which is, oddly, a negative point. The low-key griminess of the first is what really made the movie. This is just a (relatively) glossy piece of insignificant tat. Tom Savini's make-up is too comic book like for this kind of material, and the excessive gore is completely inappropriate. Fortunately, Chainsaw isn't a film that's known for its sequels, making this virtually forgotten. When the story was taken up four years later for Leatherface (6) it notably ignored the events of this one altogether and acted as a direct sequel to the first. Texas Chainsaw Massacre III was an okay if not great movie, and it's always nice to see Ken Foree. Following suit in 1994 was Return (3, repackaged under the classy title ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"") which is arguably the worst of the entire series. A moronic, twenty-song youthfest, it too ignored all prior sequels and had Leatherface recast as a crossdresser. As the family were no longer cannibals and were the most conventionally normal interpretation, then it also allowed for quite sadistic violence against women. Far from pleasant.However, Part 2 still remains fundamentally, if not artistically, the worst of the sequels. It's difficult to describe just how bad the experience of this film is unless you see it for yourself. It ultimately serves no purpose whatsoever - it's not interesting, it's not funny, It's certainly not scary and it has nothing to say. Being the sequel to a horror classic only makes it worse - absolute, interminable tripe and a complete waste of celluloid. 3/10.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
63,fernandoschiavi,"Part 2 is the opposite of the previous one, full of blood and mutilation, to be sure, but it lacks the horror of the original and the desire to be taken seriously",4,31 July 2021,"Continuing a classic must be a thankless job! Film History has already proved how difficult it is for lightning to strike twice in the same place, however much the original set the rules for success: Exorcist 2, Hellraiser 2, Psycho 2, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and countless others can serve. As an example of productions that were extremely inferior to the first film. It must be even more complicated to continue a work that you created yourself! Imagine the weight of responsibility of George A. Romero (in Awakening from the Dead) or Sam Raimi (in Evil Dead 2) when they decided to make a sequel to their classic movies!! If the results, for the most part, are inferior, what can be said of Wes Craven and his dreadful Gang of Sadists 2, a feature that practically insults the original work, and Tobe Hooper, with the terrible Chainsaw Massacre 2?Released in 1974, the original feature represented the final phase of the hippie movement - whether in the colorful look as opposed to the grainy image and the gloomy mood or in the destruction of the peace and love label - by presenting a car trip by five friends to visit the grave of the grandfather of Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns, in the best performance of her career) and her brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain). A ride to a psychopath and a stop at a slaughterhouse are the harbinger of an encounter with a family of cannibals and a confrontation with a monstrous and insane figure who uses a chainsaw to tear his victims apart. Hooks, hammers, skins and human parts serving as props, and the completion of absolute horror at a macabre dinner set the tone for a daring filmmaker's frightening and violent menu in a moment of full inspiration. Added to the crimes of Charles Manson, on the agenda in the early 1970s, and the grotesque Birthday Macabre, by Wes Craven, The Chainsaw Massacre made a sour exhibition of humanity and an example of this is in the figure of the greatest antagonist and the first icon of the genre, Leatherface, materialization on the screens of one of the worst assassins in American history, Ed Gein. He was not known for the number of murders committed, but for the way he handled the remains, using them as parts of his furniture. With such a context, you can understand why the film easily fits into the list of the best horror productions of all time.Thirteen years have passed. Tobe Hooper figured he could go back to his roots, updating the nightmare into the new phase of cinema known as terror/comedy. It was in this setting that Hooper decided to revisit the family of cannibals, developing the pathetic Chainsaw Massacre 2, from a script written by L. M. Kit Carson, who had previously written Wim Wenders' praised Paris, Texas. Carson and Hooper said that the basis of the original was black humor - who knows where they got that! So they believed that the sequel should accentuate that humor and gore, in a satire of the excesses of the 1980s. Part 2 is full of blood and mutilation, to be sure, but it lacks the horror of the original and the desire to be taken seriously. Here there is no lack of excess violence, blood, humor, bizarreness. Although it's not a trash movie, it has a lot of trash style, either because of the exaggeration or the humor.The time jump is 12 years. In the already common guttural and explanatory opening of the events that carry the film, the narrator explains to us that Sally, survivor of the previous film, managed to escape and told the police in detail all the facts of the worst night of her life. The authorities decide to investigate, but when they reach the indicated location, they do not find such evidence. The case, then, remains for ""that's right"", gaining prominence after the bully Lefyt (Denis Hopper), Sally's uncle, decides to avenge the death of his nephew Franklin, one of the victims of the bloodbath in the previous film. Before meeting him we are introduced to the final girl of the time: DJ Stretch (Caroline Williams). She works at a local radio station and while her program is broadcast, she is harassed by two young men who call to make fun of them. What makes everything unpredictable is the persecution suffered by the boys. Towards a football game, they are attacked on the road and Stretch is a witness, along with the listeners. Is it a joke or have they really been wiped out by what seems to be the sound of someone wielding a chainsaw?Hooper's cartoon character requests the broadcast audio and, from the recording, continues towards the investigations that permeate his revenge, which takes us to a macabre park full of horrible scenarios, stronghold of the family of degenerate cannibals. Like all possible excesses in a disheartening and absurd script, Stretch's story intertwines with the other events and what follows is a festival of nonsense, shallow characters, dragging narrative and all the elements that a horror film cannot have, including an anticlimactic development.Here, Tobe Hooper kicks the bucket by making this creation a negative of the original material, embracing everything the new period asked of the slasher subgenre. The difference is that the commander applies his unrestrained style to the last consequences, using either absurd sexual metaphors or internal conflicts to be externalized with abundant bestiality. An uncompromising cinema, like the vile example of Leatherface rubbing the chainsaw between the legs of the new final girl when he meets her. Caricature of the previous one, it doesn't even work as a parody. Chaotic art direction, costumes and assembly, with Savini's work as the only salvation. The special make-up and gore effects were created by Tom Savini (Friday the 13th, Dawn of the Dead, among others...) who said he was disappointed by the cuts made in one of the most violent scenes in the film, where the family killed a group of people going to the football stadium. The violence presented in the sequel is greater than that of the first film, with a lot of gore and heavy scenes, but without the same impact. One of the best scenes is one where a guy gets knocked over the head and has his skin peeled off. The number of deaths is one of the lowest in a horror film, besides the guy who has his head cut off at the beginning, the film only has ONE death, only one...If before the family avoided leaving their victims to prevent the police from investigating the crimes, in the continuation, in addition to Rick and Buzz, the radio host is left behind for being thin (!!!). In other words, if the intention was discretion, how would they avoid any controversy by supposedly murdering the DJ after she decided to provoke them? Sure enough, a big investigation would take place and Lefty's ideals would be proven! You can see how much the script has major flaws, becoming worse in the second half, with the introduction of the insane family members and clowning taking over the production once and for all. Stretch decides to follow them, unaware that Lefty does the same. They arrive at a circus, with the display of bodies as part of the attraction (!!!), where the radio host will fall into a trap and will be saved once more by Leatherface, while Lefty will decide to destroy the environment, especially when faced with a corpse in a wheelchair, believing it to be Franklin. In addition to Leatherface and Chop Top, the family comprises cook Drayton Sawyer (Jim Siedow, reprising the role) and mummified grandpa. And there is still space for the apparition of grandma, on an altar in the style of Friday the 13th - Part 2.Even without part of the skin and exposure of the flesh in some parts of the body, in addition to head hammer injuries, L. G. is still inexplicably alive! He helps Stretch free himself before the final sigh, when the radio host decides to assume that she loved him. Leatherface, aka Bubba, will have another romantic moment with the girl, putting the skin of LG's face on it. And starting a macabre waltz. Lefty will later encounter the killer in a deadly chainsaw fight; and Stretch will have to face Chop Top through the circus caves. Moralistic speeches, catchphrases, dinner with corpses, dancing with the chainsaw... make up The Electric Sierra Massacre 2, in a worse version of the original film.At first glance, Tobe Hooper's film might even guarantee some fun for some brave ones. However, the assessment gets worse with each new attempt, as crude details surface - including Leatherface's uneven posture - and the script presents its problems. For a long time, I believed the director had done a poor job in response to pressure from Cannon, until I read some interviews in which he praises his own driving and proudly displays his creation. And it's not the only one: Incredibly, Chainsaw Massacre 2 is considered by many people as superior to the original, achieving cult status.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
64,ersinkdotcom,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" still ranks as my favorite sequel to the original",8,28 May 2016,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" holds a special place in my heart as a horror fan. As a teen, I would go to my father's during the summer. I used this time visit him and the rest of my family in the area. During my downtime, I would catch up on movies I wasn't allowed to watch living with my mother. Many of the these were, of course, in the horror genre.One of my favorite memories was watching a double feature one night with my father in the summer of 1987. We went to the local video store and rented ""Psycho 2"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2."" A funny side-note is that I had never seen either one of the original films. ""Chainsaw 2"" had a profound impact on me, as it was the first truly graphic and gory movie I had seen. It also had a far sicker sense of humor than what I had witnessed in other horror / comedies like ""Fright Night"" and the likes.Revisiting ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" in its new 2K digital transfer was an interesting experience. The movie still holds up over all these years. There's nothing quite like seeing Dennis Hopper battle Leatherface in an epic chainsaw duel. Imagine Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader brandishing chainsaws instead of lightsabers and you get the idea.Caroline Williams' screams rival those of Fay Wray's in ""King Kong."" I can't think of any way she could have improved her performance, from her Texan accent to the epic Chainsaw dance at the end of the movie. She is quite the trooper and deserves all the credit she gets as a scream queen being covered in bloody goo and dirt for much of the film.Dennis Hopper comes alive as a police officer looking to avenge the deaths of his family and end the chainsaw massacre once and for all. He quotes the Bible and sings church hymns while destroying the lair of Leatherface and company, adding to the dark zaniness of the movie. He plays the role relatively straight where many other actors would have hammed it up.I was very surprised upon re-watching ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" that there's no nudity. There's suggestive material throughout the movie. However, there's no actual sexual situations or topless women to be seen. That's a big surprise to anyone who grew up watching horror movies in the 1980s. I think there might be a pinup picture in the background of a couple shots. Granny Sawyer's decomposing dead body is shown sans clothing, but there's no detail in the body parts.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" still ranks as my favorite sequel to the original. Its combination of tension and wild violence with over-the-top black humor still stands as the blueprint for most of the gore fests we get today from folks like Rob Zombie and countless others. Thanks to great practical effects, on-location shooting, and Tom Savini's masterful makeup and prosthetics, the film stands the test of time and is a great example of a well-executed sequel.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
65,acidburn-10,Horror Comedy Factor Doesn't Work,5,20 March 2008,"I just didn't like this movie very much at all, first of all it nearly ruins the reputation of the first one which was a classic, and they just completely changed the tone from the original as well. The first one was a low budget shocker and what do we get for the sequel a bigger budget horror comedy mess. This time around the crazy family is no longer real and brutal, they have become cartoon characters. Most of the humour falls flat on it's chainsaw, the Chop Top character (expansion of the Hitchhiker character, I hear he might be his brother) is suppose to be a hoot, too bad his endless rambling grated me, Leatherface falls in love what a load a crap, the cook yells all the time and chainsaws become phallic symbols. Seeing Leatherface do pelvic thrusts with his chainsaw or running on the spot like Road Runner is just absurd. Capped with a finale that seems rushed, a scene lifted from the first one and a silly last frame this movie fails on most counts. On a plus side though and the only plus side of this movie is Dennis Hopper who is a treat as the chainsaw wielding Savior, despite being great he's definitely ruins his career by choosing the rubbish to star in. I've only ever watched this movie once and that was enough.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Tom Savini's make-up effects are superb including on Leatherface's mask, this movie also made the star of ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses"" known as Bill Mosley into a cult horror actor icon. The film was released by Cannon Pictures but was threaten with an ""X"" rating for it's graphic violence and subject matter but was released without a rating.

This one was such a let down, which if released in 86', I almost certainly would of had a higher opinion of it. One plus in this film, was the presence, of a revenge seeking cop, played by the wonderful Dennis Hopper, which among so many great performances, he was only nominated once for an Oscar. We have a radio lass, who receives a couple of prank calls, one of them not so much a prank, by these two young lads, who are pursued by Leatherface, in their car. In the other vehicle, a ute, in the back, stands our bloodthirsty madman, operating the chainsaw. So when the cars draw level, we have quite a hairy scene. The radio lass teams up with Hopper to take down these freaks. We do have some quite genuinely terrifying scenes, that take place in an underground lair of Leatherface's. A sort of trophy room, but not as much gore as you'd think, but when presented, it's genuinely grisly. I just feel somehow I got short changed here.

Like a Jerry Lewis bit with gore. No thrills or fear. Just gaping awe. And not the kind you want either.Jim (RIP) Seidow did the best job here. No coincidence he was the only original to appear too. A bit of down-home charm mixed with malevolence. Hopper chewed scenery with abandon. And Caroline (stretch) was just a random figure to center it around.

Sadly, the movie has pacing problems and it's more shocking than scary. Feeling of dread is absent this time, as our heroine is practically safe from Leatherface, while others don't feel like a much of a threat. In it's own way, one could call this movie a good one, and it isn't bad, it's just that it's not good enough for me to really enjoy. It doesn't know what it wants to be, a horror or a black comedy and the result is very weird. Still, it's at least a nice satire if not anything else. I give it 6/10!

76,skybrick736,Texas Chainsaw Massacre II 5/10,5,18 July 2015,"Tobe Hooper comes back to direct a sequel that follows the events of the initial Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. Although we see Leatherface and Jim Seidow's role as ""The Cook"" return in the storyline, it was actually the newcomers characters who were the most interesting. If it wasn't for the star-power of Dennis Hopper and the desirableness of Caroline Williams, this sequel would have totally stunk in my opinion. The writing was really awful, especially hack in the beginning car chase and cook-off. Usually, a horror film is either great in the beginning and fades off or starts slow with a great ending. With TCM II, it's a first for me to say that a few scenes in the middle of the film were the most entertaining.The film lost a lot of grittiness and distinguishing characteristics that the predecessor possessed. It didn't tie itself well to its roots and I felt this was a really rushed attempt that could have been a lot better. Part 2 did enough though to hold my interest and I found myself not being too critical of the ending scenes even though it's pretty bad.

77,theshadow908,This was a mistake,1,8 August 2006,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 picks up 12 years after the original film. Dennis Hopper stars as Sally and Franklin Hardesty's uncle. He is searching for the family of cannibals responsible for their deaths so he can have his revenge. Meanwhile, the cannibalistic family goes after a radio DJ who accidentally recorded a murder. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a cult classic, and since Tobe Hooper returns to the director's chair, you might think this would be a decent sequel. You'd be dead wrong.When Tobe Hooper directed the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, he did it on a shoestring budget. It ended up being a cult classic, and the low budget gave it a style all its own. He was given a much bigger budget for this sequel. What he does wrong is take his big budget and try to make it look as low budget as the first film. This doesn't give it style, it makes it look ridiculous. The other big problem is that this movie was turned into a comedy when it should have been horror. The family is now a bunch of bumbling fools, including Leatherface. Leatherface was originally an inhuman killing machine, but now he has mercy toward a woman he's supposed to kill because he's horny. The plot and dialogue are absolutely ridiculous.The acting is atrocious. Dennis Hopper is usually okay for a b-movie actor, but he is especially bad in this movie. The female lead, who's name I can't remember, is pathetic. As I said before, the cannibalistic family is played only for laughs now, and it's really stupid.Overall, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 doesn't touch the original film, or the remake.

He however uses her as bait and she is taken by the Chop Top and the gang. He then has to try and save her before she becomes dinner. After the intensity of the original, that was probably impossible to top, Hooper decided to go with a comic leaning this time, some of it works some of it doesn't, but by the end i was just about persuaded it was fun. Hopper is naturally OTT, he doesn't quite sleepwalk through the film like others have stated, but he also doesn't really excel either.

Their newfound success may be cut short, however, by crazed Texas lawman Dennis Hopper, out to avenge his niece and nephew who were tortured and/or murdered 12 years earlier. Pretty much dismissed by critics and audiences alike upon its initial release, this bizarre, offbeat horror-comedy has developed a rigorous cult following over the years, and has slowly been rediscovered by many who ignored it earlier. Filled with sarcastic jokes lampooning America's obsession with pop culture, social status, war and violence, the movie is a far cry from the terrifying (and only subtly satiric) original.

80,Danny_G13,"Not good, not good at all",4,21 March 2005,"Sequel to seminal classic fails to emulate anything the original succeeded so brilliantly at.OK, so it *is* a sequel, but by no means do they have to be weak. Godfather 2 and T2 are examples of movies arguably superior to their older brothers (In the case of Godfather 2 I dispute this, but will play devil's advocate in the name of argument) and cases in point that sequels can build on the first movies in positive ways. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is not an example of this in action. Everything about this movie is significantly inferior to TCM which truly makes you ponder why a genuinely huge star like Dennis Hopper would have got caught up in such vacuous trash.TCM2 is set 14 years after the events of the previous massacre, with the brother of one of the victims now posted as a small-time cop who gets involved with a new case which seems to be a re-emergence of the old killings.He enlists the help of a radio DJ (Yes, really) to take on the family of cannibals, and in going to their lair acquires 3 chainsaws of his own (I'm not making this up) to fight them and gain revenge.Put plainly, the movie is pretty ridiculous.It tries everything and ends up succeeding at very little. The first sign of just how bad it is going to be is actually during the opening credits - the 'horror' music which accompanies the titles is unintentionally amusing. You can almost picture the musician's exaggerated gesturing as they emphasise key notes...Once into the movie it's an episode right out of The Munsters (Gory Edition). Stupidly OTT characters hammily forced by b-movie acting which is quite insufferable for the duration. Comedy is tried here and it's quite embarrassing to witness. Seeing LeatherFace's bizarre 'mating dance'-esque routine is laughable. Is that supposed to add anything to this story?Then add a general lack of gore and you have a pseudo-lighthearted failure at a splatter flick. There's no real suspense here, there's no twisted disturbing content, there's no real sense of foreboding. It's like this movie is a parody of TCM1 and not a funny or good one.It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but any picture which makes Dennis Hopper look both ridiculous and a bad actor is clearly not going to contend for Oscars.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
81,ragingbull_2005,How to screw up a remake,1,16 November 2012,"14 years have passed since the events of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 2 guys are heading down to a small town in the same state and they call a local radio station. They are troubling the RJ when they are attacked by two guys in a pickup wielding a chainsaw. This is recorded on tape. There is a sheriff who comes for investigating the case. He has personal stakes in the investigation because his relatives were killed in the first part by the cannibals. The killers attack the RJ at her radio station and then all hell breaks loose. I had high respect for Tobe Hooper. The first part of TCM is for me an iconic movie. It was ages ahead of its time and totally blew me away. He also directed the very disturbing Poltergeist. However, after 1981, his career was in decline and this must be the very nadir. The expectations from a movie which is sequel to such a landmark are bound to be high. However, this is not a victim of high expectations. The production values are nearly zero. The acting is laughable. The script can be written on the back of your pinky finger. The thrills are absent. Leatherface, the terrifying chainsaw carrying assassin has been reduced to a sappy lover over here which is frankly unbelievable. Dennis Hopper, as the sheriff, is in the worst role of his life. The cannibal family is more irritating than terrifying. When the franchise was rebooted in 2003, it was great that this catastrophe was not referred to. I cannot give negative marks on IMDb.

83,Thrashman88,A Total Waste Of Talent,3,14 March 2004,"Someone here said that Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 was a ""misunderstood"" film by all accounts. Let me set the record straight: TCM2 is a BAD movie, period. But Why? Why is it such a bad movie if its original creator, Tobe Hooper, was behind the cameras again??? It's hard for me to say how bad this movie is, since I like Tobe Hooper, LOVE the original TCM and am a gore hound, fangoria-reading freak myself. But the facts are there and they can't be denied. It's tough to beat the visceral aggression of the original; when I was young and saw TCM, I almost thought that it was really a picture based on a true account (now I know it was ""loosely"" based on the Ed Gein case). There is very little actual ""gore"" per sé on the original, but the visuals, sounds and convincing acting made it the classic it is...in other words, I actually believed what was going on. In TCM2, Mr.Hooper tried to make a ""horror"" comedy, but failed miserably. The dark and deviant humor of the original is NOWHERE to be found this time around. Now it's just ""dumb humor"". Not even make up guru Tom Savini, with his extreme make up fx tricks could save this turkey. The acting is beyond redemption. Even Dennis Hopper looks silly as the ""hero"", looking to avenge some of the first TCM characters. And the stretch character (this sequel's equivalent of Marylin Burns) is just plain unbelievable (it's NOT a compliment). Her acting is not that bad when she is not being chased by leather face, but once she is on the run, her screams and her gestures look totally fake, as if she were in some SCARY MOVIE episode. What's more sad is that, TCM2 actually starts out good; the outlook of the movie was interesting for the 1st 40 minutes. Unfortunately, after those 40 minutes, it all goes downhill with stupid situations and not believable acting. Granted, there's more gore on this one than on the 1st one; Leatherface's first victim gets his head sawed off in half in a very gruesome Savini effect. But even with this, the movie doesn't work. What worked on the 1st one is that you BELIEVED tha characters and the situations were, in some way, believable. Remember the psycho guy in the first one? The one that gets run over by a truck at the end? Well, the guy's ALIVE in TCM2!!!Albeit, with a metal plate as part of his skull. How come he SURVIVED getting run over by a Mack Truck?!?!? The ""Grandpa"" guy looks better 13 years later! He must've taken some sort of rejuvenating potion or something! And the ending is just plain atrocious. Get this down: TCM2 does not scare, does not make you sick and does not make you laugh. It's a movie that could have been developed into something really sick and frightening, but it didn't. It seems the ""big budget"" of this sequel was completely worthless. It seems Tobe Hooper tried to make a ""black Horror Comedy"", in the vein of EVIL DEAD or even RE-ANIMATOR, but failed miserably. Watch this turkey ONLY if you're a Tom Savini fan or want to know how bad a sequel can be. 3* out of 10*.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Nuanced tension building is replaced with ""more is more"" theatrics. This may have inherently less artistic merit, but it does follow through on an intention that's impossible to ignore. In a way, maybe this always should have been the tone, as no one ever expected subtlety from a movie called Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It gets to the point quickly then proceeds with a relentless bludgeoning of blood and gore. Not achieving the comedic brilliance found in the excesses of the Evil Dead franchise, but thankfully not succumbing to the trappings of self serious torture porn.

87,happyendingrocks,A misunderstood and much-maligned sequel that isn't nearly as bad as you've heard,7,15 April 2011,"One's enjoyment of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 will largely depend on the ease with which you can judge the film on its own merits and divorce your criticism from any comparison to the legendary classic that preceded it. There's no question that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most truly scary and horrifying films the genre has ever been graced with, so any sequel is pretty much pre-destined to be a lesser experience. However, if you can manage the seemingly impossible task of forgetting all about TCM and focusing solely on what this film brings to the table, you will be forced to grudgingly conclude that while Masscare 2 doesn't venture anywhere near the heights of Tobe Hooper's original macabre masterpiece, this unnecessary sequel is still a fun romp in its own right.The tone here is so far removed from the movie it reprises that it's hard to believe that Hooper was once again sitting in the director's chair. While Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a relentless and brutal tour de force of terror, Part 2 inserts a black humor sensibility that discards any pretensions of this being a strictly horror-based vehicle, and shifts our entire view of the cannibalistic Sawyer clan. This time out, the family doesn't come across as a hideously deranged group of killers, but rather as somewhat goofy collective of sadists whose tastes for violence veer closer to the physical comedy of The Three Stooges than to anything in the fright flick canon. Admittedly, this shouldn't work as well as it does, but a brilliant performance from Bill Mosely, who handily steals the show, straddles the fine line between gruesome and giggling and keeps the film from sinking beneath its playful facade.The plot is fairly ridiculous by any standards, and when the impetus for lead heroine Caroline Williams to be stalked by the saw-happy band of lunatics is her repeatedly playing an audio recording of a brutal murder on her radio show, we know right away that we're going to have to suspend our disbelief to swallow this one.Hooper's direction is surprisingly keen considering the radical departure he's overseeing, and he keeps us wondering exactly how far into the realm of absurdist comedy the film is going to reach until about the midway point. When an amusingly manic Dennis Hopper straps a pair of chainsaws to his hips like six-shooters and charges into the meat-loving family's lair screaming like Rambo, it should be abundantly clear to even the most jaded viewer that the film isn't going to bother to take itself seriously, and we shouldn't either.Despite the heavy emphasis on morbid funnies, the film does throw a few solid scares into the mix, and these jump-inducing moments arrive precisely when we've let our guard down, giving them unexpected and jolting impact. There's also a fairly generous amount of gore, and the effects work of Tom Savini adds immeasurably to the horror quotient.Unfortunately, Savini's skills aren't called upon very often here, and even when they are, the MPAA did a particularly thorough job of forcing much of Tom's artistry to linger on the cutting room floor. Only a couple of scenes recall the gravitas of Savini's most infamous work, and while it's certainly not his fault that his creations were so severely neutered, his name in the credits writes a check that the heavily-trimmed final product can't cash.Still, the film does deliver some grotesque elements, and it's far bloodier than its predecessor. It's also a bit more twisted in its own quirky way, and Leatherface's amorous attachment to Caroline Williams provides some demented moments that are almost uncomfortable to laugh at. The sequence where our ""hero"" presses his decidedly phallic chainsaw against Williams's crotch assuredly skirts the bounds of bad taste, but the scene that sticks out most in my mind is one in which he covers her face with the flayed skin of her friend and playfully dances with her in a room cluttered with severed body parts.Williams is excellent here, as is Hopper, who seems to be having a ball hamming it up and wringing every bit of mirth possible out of his one-dimensional archetype. Bill Johnson is equally fantastic as Leatherface, and he manages to convey a multi-faceted character through his nuanced grunts and facial expressions, no easy feat when all we see of him are his eyes and mouth.The sprawling subterranean set where the final action unfolds is an impressive and well-realized creation that provides an audaciously epic upgrade from the humble farmhouse in the first film. Dicey loopholes inevitably arise (if the family travels from place to place to keep their crimes undiscovered, would they really have hauled the body of Franklin, who they killed over a decade before, to their current location, where Hopper finds it?), but those who admire set decoration will have a lot of fun pausing the frames and taking in the vast minutiae on display in the background.The climax, where Hopper and Leatherface duke it out with dueling chainsaws like a pair of swashbucklers, is by far the most widely referenced aspect of the film. Most detractors point to this scene as the stupidest part of the movie, and they're clearly right. However, considering that the bulk of the film revels in a parody mindset, I actually can't think of a more fitting way for it to conclude.Yes, there clearly shouldn't have been a sequel to such a perfectly essayed snapshot of horror. But Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is an inherently enjoyable offering if you accept it on its own terms. There's no denying that it's an entertaining film, and since it practically announces its separation from the original from the opening frames, we can't accuse Tobe Hooper of failing to realize his vision, however skewed that vision might be.Give this troubled production another look, and, more importantly, give it a chance.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

I do enjoy it as see some of the good things about the film such as the gore brought to us by Tom Savini is top notch, the direction from Hooper is pretty good as well. I am not 100% a fan of how Leatherface is portrayed in the film though. I much prefer Gunnar Hansen's portrayal in the original than Johnson's in the sequel. He was scary and menacing in the first one. Here, he kind of to me is the butt of a few jokes, not really scary and is played for laughs.Anyways, if you enjoyed the original give this one a shot.

90,Toronto85,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,7,29 June 2011,"TCM 2 was definitely not as serious as the original film, but it had a lot of charm to it. It begins in Texas (of course) with two young men driving along the road. They call a local radio station which is when we meet our leading lady Stretch (Caroline Williams) the DJ. While on the phone with the guys, Leatherface murders both of them Stretch manages to hear the chainsaw in the background. The police try to make their deaths seem like a simple auto accident, but when a former Texas Ranger Lefty (Dennis Hopper) sees the accident scene, he knows it was more than an accident. And when Stretch gives him the audio tape of the murder, he realizes that Leatherface has struck again. Once the infamous Sawyer family catches on that people know of their crimes, they trap Stretch in their sick twisted maze of dead corpses and rotting flesh.Chainsaw 2 was made at a time when it was competing with the Krueger/Myers/Vorhees sequels. So it had to live up to the modern day slasher film, that means more blood. It's a lot more gory than the controversial first TCM. In this one, you literally see a guy get skinned alive, his face is almost peeled off for Leatherface to use as a mask. Oh and the family is explored more in this sequel. Jim Siedow reprises the role of ""The Cook"" Drayton Sawyer. He now sells chili to the fine people of Texas. He proclaims at a local cook off that it's his special secret recipe. Take a guess what he uses to make the chili....Yeah so as you can see, TCM 2 is a little more morbid and comical in a black comedy sort of way. The maze that Stretch gets trapped in near the end is an old amusement park that the Sawyers are living in. Very creepy set they built for it as well. The acting is pretty good for this one as well. We also discover Dennis Hopper's character is related to Franklin, the man in the wheelchair from the first TCM. Nice little connection. All in all, a decent sequel to a 70's classic. It's not as memorable as the first or even as good, but a fine slasher film nonetheless.7/10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
91,swedzin,A dumb madness,4,2 October 2013,"I don't get it. I just don't get it. What happened? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is a really good horror film, and it is considered by many as one of the best horror films ever. I mean, it's right there at the top ten horror films, if not even top five horror films. And this kind of film deserves a decent and worthy sequel. And we got this. It's just a bad idea. It's badly written, with dumb, annoying, one-dimensional characters and the movie itself doesn't try to scare us, but rather to make us all go nuts from the sheer annoyance. And the thing that it hurts the most is the fact that it was directed by Tobe Hopper, the director of the original. Really? What happened? Tobe, alongside the writer L.M. Kit Carson ruined the original just like that.Take a lot at the plot, a radio DJ Vanita aka 'Stretch' (played by Caroline Williams. Caroline was pretty good at her ""screamy, scared girl element"", though I think she was also pretty hot there), accidentally record the murder of two hoodlums, by Leatherface. And then, there's a former sheriff played by Denis Hopper (OK, Hopper is a great actor, but I don't understand how the hell he ended up here. He was good, no argue there, but I think that this film was a waste of his talents), who is interested for Vanita's audio murder tape. Also, he is uncle of Sally Hardesty and Franklin Hardesty (the original film characters) and he demands a revenge. And from the moment when the murderous family finds Vanita, therefore begins a dumb, annoying madness, that simply makes you wanna tear your TV apart, asking yourself what a hell is going on with this film? It's loud, it's over the top, while in the original, we have the same thing happening, but the amount and style of madness in the original was good, it was scary and insane, makes you want to be scare some more but here it just repels you. The other things as musical score, editing they were solid, in their own horror element. Other actors as Jim Siedow (another actor from the original film, the older brother of the family, who now runs a successful business with the hamburgers, made from human flesh bad idea, if you ask me). Siedow's performance was annoying and cartoonish here. I expected, when I first saw him, to be more darker, more developed. But no, this guy was straight from the cartoon. And as I recall, he was far more convincing in the first film, here he decided not to give a damn, although he gave us an solid amount of insanity performance. Bill Moseley plays Chop-Top Sawyer, an extremely insane and annoying character. No development, nothing scary about him, he is Joker wanna-be. Bill is a good actor, but damn here he was just badly written. I have this little theory. I think that the character of Chop-Top is actually the hitchhiker from the original film, because there was no mention of him before. Or, he just jumped as the new ""Sawyer family"" character out of nowhere This is what I don't understand, who the hell is he? Where did he come from? Nothing is explained. And we have Leatherface (played by Bill Johnson). The only developed character in the film. The actor Bill Johnson fitted pretty well in the costume and in the trademark mask, giving his imposing height and mass, although constant mumbled yelling irritated me pretty much. Here we see Leatherface has developed an emotional love response to our leading lady. Well, that is interesting difference.HERE COMES SPOILERS: I think that there are some dumb stuff that I just can't I just can't resist not to tell you about it. Vanita and sheriff Lefty (Hopper) made a deal for Vanita to play the murder audio tape to attract the killers. And he would come to rescue her, armed with chainsaws yep that's another thing, Hopper is armed with three chainsaws, one big, two smaller ones. Only to have an epic duel with Leatherface. Why he just didn't go on with his Frank Booth performance? That would scare Sawyer family. Now, about that idea, about playing the murder audio tape that was the dumbest idea ever. And if you are thinking right now, ""what would your idea would be?"". I don't know, I really don't know. But that idea almost killed Vanita and she could also get fired for that damn man. Tobe Hopper could figure out something better to lure the killers out. And the ending the ending is so without climax, it's truly disappointing. I will not spoil for you more but you just get really no informed about the ending.SPOILDER ENDS Don't watch this film. Only if you want to link the original and other films, go ahead.

Somehow, a truck in reverse is able to drive straight(backwards) all the way down a bridge while keeping pace with a speeding sports car, while Leatherface stands up in the bed, sawing through the car and killing people.

Who is buying stuff from them or interacting with them, thinking these guys are even remotely normal?11)Instead of bringing a gun or sneaking in, Hopper brings like 30 chainsaws(so he can have a Star Wars saber duel?) and screams 50 ft. away from the hideout to announce he is there. He then cuts random beams that should have collapsed on his head and harmed him.12)How is grandpa still alive at 137? Must be the superb health coverage offered by his troglodyte relatives and their sanitized retirement home environment? Laughably ludicrous. It is as if they could not decide if this was to be dark comedy or scary horror. It translates to a gory mess that is so stupid you can't help but shake your head and laugh. Apparently there were obvious miscommunications, as the studio wasn't happy.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
95,lnvicta,Hooper's stylish directing saves this from being an unwatchable schlockfest.,5,29 June 2015,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a terrible film. I knew going in it would be nothing like the original and was completely fine with that, but this movie goes out of its way to be as ridiculous as possible. The genuine scares from the original have been replaced by awkward comedic bits, from the cannibal family's bickering to Leatherface making silly faces (yeah, they had the audacity to turn Leatherface into a punchline). It's just embarrassing, and this is largely due to an inconsistent script. The first act sets an ominous tone from its premise of hearing a murder live on the radio and the radio host being terrorized by the same murderers. Then the second act is silly, borderline cartoonish with Leatherface acting like a hormonal teenager; and the third act tries to pay homage to the original by recreating the dinner scene almost exactly as it was in the first (but not nearly as effective) combined with an admittedly cool chainsaw duel between Lefty (Dennis Hopper) and Leatherface, then closing with a somewhat thrilling final struggle for the heroine to make her escape. Then it closes with another ""homage"" to the original and then credits roll and a cheesy '80s pop song ensues. If not for the second act, it had potential to be an engrossing story and potentially disturbing (the gore is still top-notch) but the drastic shifts in tone make it virtually impossible to become immersed into this overtly fake, cartoonish world.Thankfully, Tobe Hooper's directing makes even the dullest moments of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 aesthetically pleasing. The location and set design is perfect - the underground lair with brightly colored lights juxtaposed with rotting corpses and leftover entrails is oddly unsettling, and the scenery during the final moments of the movie is hauntingly beautiful. Hooper knows how to make these scenes look as gritty and urgent as possible. Dennis Hopper's Texas ranger was also a welcome addition. He was related to Franklin of the first movie and is out for revenge on these hillbillies so he buys the biggest chainsaw he can, then storms their lair screaming his lungs out like a lunatic.What ultimately killed this movie for me (aside from the script) is the lead actress. She is just awful. You can't take anything she says seriously because of how poorly she delivers her lines, and her screams are so forced and annoying I was practically rooting for Leatherface to chop her head off. Her relationship with Leatherface is also forced and awkward, but maybe that was the screenwriters' attempt at comedy. There are a couple laughs in this movie, and by that I mean two; three max. Something about the bombastic chainsaw duel is undeniably exhilarating, despite it not being fleshed out to its full potential.There is some fun to be had in this movie, but you have to suffer through a lot of stupidity to get there. I have no idea how sequels continued coming out after this, and I can even empathize why they would want to make a ""sequel reboot"" with Texas Chainsaw 3D, but that was even more abominable than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's true sequel - this - and this is pretty darn bad. This movie is for Leatherface completists only.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Anyway let's get down to another review of horror madness from the dead, lol.The original 1974 cult (never go to Texas) classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a large hit and still remains in our souls of being one of the most bone chilling, shocking horror films of all time. It is my third favorite horror film and I treasure it for it's memories of disgust but intelligent scares. That was Tobe Hooper's good and only really scary film.Now the his sequel ""The Buzz is Back!"" isn't a bad sequel at all though it really falls on the lines of the original as Tobe decided to go to a more comedic root instead of sticking to the horror ones. The horror roots were put back into the third and fourth though they are way beyond crappy.Moving on I'll point out the good and bad plotters for TCM 2.The good: The acting is still good especially Bill Moselsy who played the insane, cannibalistic f***ed up Chop Top who loves his dead corpses. The only returning character (s) is Dawerer (I think that's his name) and he still did a good job. Dennis Hopper also did really well and the back up actors were average.The kills aren't great though there bloody enough. 1 point there.The music also had a weird feel to it and the humor was contained well and there were enough scenes to make me enjoy this film a lot.The bad: The only problem I had with this film was that even if the humor was average and contained well, it sucked that Tobe Hooper took it to a different level and the scares are no where to be found. That's the only major problem other wise.....6.5/10 (It's another good slasher film if your bored and it has the right amount of enjoyment leaking out of it) I would watch this awesome sequel than wasting my time on TCM 3, TCM Next Gen and TCm the Beginning.

97,Vampenguin,Nightmarish comic book come to life!,8,5 June 2006,"This film is a lot of fun. It forgoes the gritty realism of the first film for over-the-top gore and comedy, with crazy characters and bizarre situations aplenty. The end result is more like some sort of nightmarish comic book come to life than a slasher flick.Let me start off with the characters. Dennis Hopper is great as usual as Lefty Enright, uncle of Sally and Franklin from the first film. He's completely obsessed with finding the killers responsible for their deaths. He gives a great performance, going from 100% badass near to first of the film to certified lunatic as it near the end. The Sawyer family is even more over-the-top. Leatherface and Drayton (AKA The Cook) return from the first film, crazier than ever, and are joined by brother Choptop, who puts the rest of them to shame in terms of craziness. Bill Moseley plays him superbly, in what is easily one of best and most over-the-top roles. I didn't particularly care for Strech, the heroic late-night radio DJ, but she was well acted and served her purpose.The plot was much better than the majority of slasher movies, but I think it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. I didn't even read the back of the DVD before I watched it, and I really think that helped my experience.Last but not least, the gore! The first film had almost no on screen gore; it left it up to the viewer's imaginations. This is the polar opposite, throwing buckets of blood and body parts at the audience as often as possible. One of the greatest horror effects gurus, Tom Savini, was behind them, so you know they had to look awesome.All in all, I really enjoyed this film. It's brutal, it's insane, and it's a lot of fun.8.5/10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

The `plot' concerns a former Texas marshal (Hopper) hunting the Sawyer family 14 years after the original, while an ambitious radio DJ (Williams) is victimized by the crazy chainsaw family. Filled with revolting gore, this movie completely trashes the legend of the original for the sake of buckets of cheap-looking fake gore and typical 80s slasher film mentality.

99,shaun98,Better than expected,6,11 June 2002,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**
The second ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" film is one of the better horror sequels of the 1980's. Given the generally low quality of genre films from the period, especially sequels, that's not usually saying a whole lot. Nonetheless, despite its flaws, it's certainly worth the effort for horror fans. It's not as good as the original: that is asking too much; it was an unique, one-of-a-kind film, one that is perhaps best left alone. Still, the sequel does not tarnish its memory. On the contrary, it revitalizes the concept with a fresh approach. Director Tobe Hooper realized that even he would be hard-pressed to outdo his own groundbreaking film, so he wisely takes the material in a whole new direction altogether. The first ""Massacre"" was a grim, bleak horror film; the second is an over-the-top dark comedy. There's much more gore than the original, but it's so bizarre and frenetic that it's impossible to take seriously. It's done with so much panache that we can't help but hop on and go along for the ride. The funny thing about it is that it actually does a decent job of making Leatherface sympathetic. This odd plot thread starts with a symbolic chainsaw/phallic symbol sequence that is absolutely priceless; it's intense and bizarre, the way a TCM film should be. So the guy's not evil, just misunderstood? That's right, and it works. He is actually capable of thinking of another human being as more than just fodder for the meat-grinder. No wonder this guy is killing people; it's his only outlet for sexual frustration. Makes sense, in light of some of his father's comments.
What can I say about the acting? It's all over-the-top, like the movie itself. You get to see an insane Dennis Hopper in a chainsaw duel with Leatherface; how can you go wrong with that? Absurd, but compelling in a bizarre way. Hopper can always be counted on to spice up a movie, and he certainly doesn't let us down, although he's equally effective in his quieter moments. Likewise, Jim Siedow and Bill Johnson are clearly enjoying themselves as members of the nuttiest family on the planet, and Bill Moseley is so uninhibited it's surreal. In contrast, Caroline Williams provides a center of normalcy as the heroine--until she also loses it all in the end.
This is not an unqualified recommendation, though. the first half-hour is fairly tedious, with little action to break the monotony. I know that some scenes were removed for time and content reasons, but the film does suffer for that. From what I hear, they originally depicted some more Leatherface action, which will hopefully find its way into a future special edition. As it is, the film is rough going at first, then it thankfully picks up with a terrifying sequence. From that point on, the pace rarely flags, although it gets a bit exhausting after a while. Hooper hadn't lost his touch.

101,mrush,This is one of the good ones,8,8 April 2006,"Of all the hundreds of horror films I've seen this is one that has always been among what I consider the best.Now it doesn't have the sheer impact of terror of Tobe Hooper's first one because we sort of know about the chainsaw ,of course,but Hooper still manages to freak you out, nonetheless.Part 2 isn't a rewarmed version of the first one.In this film the crazy killer cannibal family is running a catering business,and winning awards for it,no less.Let's just say their secret is the meat.Dennis Hopper plays a lawman on the trail of the insane family and his character is only a shade less crazy than they are.Hopper is absolutely great in this film and we are treated to some wickedly gory special effects by the great Tom Savini.The duel between Leatherface and Hopper is a legendary scene while the Old Man prattles on underneath the table on which they are dueling with chainsaws.This film is an original.No other film I know so well combines terror,horror,gore and craziness .It also has it's share of memorable lines.Tobe Hooper created a masterpiece with this film but sadly it seems to have been overlooked by many folks who may just consider it a crappy sequel without ever having watched it.Yes the horror genre does contain many crappy sequels,including parts 3 and 4 of this series, but this film isn't one of them.Tobe Hooper served up a delicious meaty meal with this film and true horror fiends lapped it up.Now it's your turn.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
102,jamhorner,Sawing into Stardom,5,7 December 2007,"This sequel, unlike the original classic, was like an acid trip with extra acid. Not that I'm saying it was horrible or that it was the best thing to hit horror cinema, what I am saying is that it seemed a bit too cheesy and b-movie-ish. It wasn't scary as much as it was disturbing, but at the same time it seemed like a comedy and there were many points where it was a bit too over the top. The acting was descent, the cinematography (special effects and lighting) where way over the top, the plot was worn out and the scares were replaced by some good laughs. It was not the original and it had far more impossibilities than any other Tobe Hooper film I have seen. In this case, Texas Chainsaw 2 was okay and worth watching.First off, the acting was okay, it wasn't Oscar worthy but it certainly wasn't the worst acting I have seen. Bill Moseley, who plays Chop Top, does a real good performance capturing the demented and mentally damaged war veteran who has an obsession of transforming the theme park into NamLand. Ken Evert, was okay and did a somewhat good job recapturing the personality of the grandpa from the original, but in this movie he ads a bit more comic relief (i.e. the people he cuts up is used for award winning Chile). Dennis Hooper, whom I'm surprised to see, did a fairly silent and random character that is out for revenge. Now, giving the fact he was brilliant in Easy Rider, this film was a step below his acting career. In the movie he seems a bit over the top (when he goes nuts with the chainsaws), and at points seemed as if he did this for fun. In this film, Leatherface was not a maniac that had faces resemble his personality, but seemed more like a young boy who has fallen in love and throws temper tantrums. This reworking of Leatherface, to me, proved to be a disaster and a step below the personality of the original killer.The plot is vastly different from the original; basically a radio hostess hears a brutal murder over the phone and is later kidnapped by the very same cannibalistic family. A renegade cop searching for redemption is proved to find the culprits even if it means destroying the entire place with duel chainsaws in a spaghetti western style showdown. However, some of the stuff that could have been vastly scary or disturbing turned out to be a bit funny and gross. They try to bring back that iconic scene from the original with the old man and the hammer, but this one backfired and proved to be comic rather than horrific. Some things that made this plot line seem a bit too unnatural was the use of some extreme impossibilities that was used in this film. Examples like: standing up on a car and killing people in the other vehicle with chainsaw, a skinless man walking and talking and having two huge chainsaws hanging from a belt. They seemed so cheesy and out of the blue that it was enjoyable. It was just way different from the original and I guess that is okay.The one thing that I really like that the other one did not have was the extreme use of camera angles, lighting and tone of the film. These aspects were so over the top that it made up for some of the poor audio and music. The lighting, especially at night, were very colorful and high contrast and seemed to have come straight out of a comic book. In the radio building there was a high contrast of shadowy reds when Moseley's character appears, even higher tones of red and splashes of green when Leatherface appears. In numerous hallways there was dim lighting with obtuse red, green, yellow and blue shapes and oranges in the main dining hall. I think that by utilizing the lights, it really made this movie atmospheric and haunting. The camera angels (mostly seen in the radio station) where amazing and uses a wide variety of zooms and pans. Some of the best pans and trucks were seen in the ""cave"" where this family lives and one the best zooms is when it zooms out of the dinner table and the girls is crying. With the camera angles, this movie had a bit of a zest to it that I don't see that often in movies of this magnitude.Overall, this movie was not the worst thing I have ever seen, nor was it the best thing I have ever seen. There was an equal balance of good and bad aspects of this film ranging from bad acting to excellent cinematography and it had a vastly different plot, but was executed wrongly. I enjoyed this film mainly because it was different that your average cannibalistic family tale, this one seemed a bit more on edge and acid driven. Of coarse, it did not frightened me the way I initially hoped, but it did strike me as being very theatrically disturbing and seemed as if it came from the mind of a drugged out hippie. I would recommend this film to any horror fan, partly because its trip and an experience that I think al horror fanatics should be aware of. It's one of those movies it's famous for being famous, and the first of its kind in along sad history of Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels. (I hated Texas Chainsaw: Next Generation). It's just a fun and wacky film that nobody should miss.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
103,legendaryunderdog,Dennis Hopper Vs. Leatherface... Who Da Thunk it?,8,2 August 2007,"I actually found this movie entertaining and funny at the same time. Dennis Hopper (the usual man with a past problem who needs to clean house) plays a great role as 'Lefty', the radio DJ chick also provided some entertainment, at least if not visual entertainment (ladies are cute what can I say!) Leatherface becomes more'Human' in this movie, the guy who keeps lighting a coat-hanger on fire and then keeps picking at the back of his head around his metal plate and eating the dead flesh, now that guy was a 'different' kind of cool. He was definitely one funky mother I can tell you that.

104,GTeixeira,"Underrated, surprisingly worthwhile sequel to one of horror's best",8,22 October 2013,"I rarely find horror sequels worthwhile. They tend to be nothing but an endless repetition of the original, as if they are fearful of trying something new and not only not reaching a new audience but also losing the original's fans. So, I was suspicious of this; more so because of how great the original was.Maybe it's the fact Tobe Hooper returns and is in control of the film (something that obviously wasn't the case in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist'). Hooper is good enough a filmmaker to know that he couldn't top/repeat the sense of realism that made the first 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' so powerful, so he instead dared to take a different approach: he takes it easy and satirizes itself. Whereas the first TCM was extremely real, suspenseful, and surprisingly not very bloody/gory, 'Part 2' is high on blood, gore and an horror atmosphere that, while far from realistic, is still very effective. Yet, the film never takes itself too seriously; it is full of a dark, macabre and self-satirizing sense of humor, with very twisted and even depraved gags and an omnipresent black humor even in the more 'serious' parts.Of course, it sometimes exaggerates (Dennis Hopper often overdoes on the insane acting, and I found Chop-Top rarely funny), or even become severely inappropriate/deranged (Leatherface's confrontation with the DJ, for example). However, it is nonetheless fun most of the time (the chainsaw fight must be seen to be believed).All in all, it is a very good horror film that has been far too (and unjustly) vilified. It is well directed and thought-out, never taking itself too serious but never fully falling into the absurd/laughable category of horror; while far from the original's level, it is a very worthy sequel.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
105,terrible2,Gory Sequel Galore,10,3 June 2005,"As in the case with the ""Evil Dead"" series, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this sequel better then the original. Director, Tobe Hooper, must have had a bit more of a budget in order to land the likes of Dennis Hopper as ""Lieutenant ""Lefty"" Enright"" as our deranged hero. The film centers around ""Stretch"" (Caroline Williams) as a disc jockey who accidentally records an audio tape of a chainsaw massacre in progress from some listeners. Of course, our favorite murderous family wants the tape and will do what it takes to obtain it. This is where the film really takes off. ""Bubba"" or ""Leatherface"", whichever you prefer is played by Bill Johnson, who does a fine job behind his mask of human flesh, but my personal fav has got to be ""Chop Top"" played brilliantly by Bill Moseley. The two gruesome brothers set out on a chainsaw rampage, that includes a mixture of slap stick and one liners, all the while splattering the screen with enough blood and guts to make even the the truest horror junkie blush. The ""Chainsaw"" films that came after this one could never match it's humor or gore. It has remained in my top five horror flicks, since it's release.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
106,jake-179,The most unsafe way of using a chainsaw I have ever seen,7,26 December 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The guys in the car at the beginning call the radio station, and the radio station cannot disconnect the call unless THEY hang up?  What kind of phone system does this radio station have?  They should really upgrade!  The punk guys in the car are having a SUPER good time as they drive aimlessly across the country.  It is light when we first see them, and their death scene comes at night, but they are STILL howling and laughing hysterically because they are having a SUPER good time.  Those guys have a lot of energy!  When the driver gets his head cut in half, little drinking fountains of blood squirt out of his exposed brain.  I thought that was super funny looking. Couldn't they have just stopped the car?  Bill Mosely playing the part of Chop Top is very entertaining.  That guy is hysterical as he uses a hot coat hanger to scratch away the skin over his metal plate.  That was really disturbing.  You definitely get a feeling for that character as having picked his head for a long time.  He made me laugh out loud when Leatherface hits his plate and Mosely croaches on the floor screaming, ""VIET NAM FLASH BACK! VIET NAM FLASH BACK!""  That was SUPER funny!  Also funny, the crazy side-to-side dance that Leatherface performs with the chainsaw above his head.  He does that dance a lot when he could be sawing people instead. He keeps missing his opportunities to saw people because he is busy dancing side to side.  My friend DJ (Donnyzona on this site) can perform this dance with great expertise!  It is quite a disturbing sight!  Also hysterical is the part where Dennis Hopper purchases some chainsaws.  He tests the saws out on a log outside the store and HACKS the log as if he were using an AX! Somebody needs to explain to him that the chainsaw was invented to eliminate the AX CHOPPING motion!  You can just stand there and gently push the saw through the wood.  You should not chop at the wood!  That is bad for the saw!  But it made the shop owner very happy!  He says, ""OH MY ACHING BANANA!""  After narrowly escaping Leatherface and Choptop, Stretch chooses to chase after them on her own at NIGHT.  Seems like an IMPOSSIBLY bad idea that the character would not have actually done that.  That leads her down to their ""lair.""And this is the part of the movie that is somewhat intriguing.  At that point in the movie, the story takes on a mythological aproach to the story. This is the classic ""Prometheus versus the Minotaur in the Labrynth"" scenario.  You will find that many horror movies use this premise.  The best adaption of this premise in a horror movie is the original ""ALIEN.""  In this movie, Stretch (who is hot) is lost in this abysmal labrynth, a long intertwined maze of tunnels full of horrors and inhabited by ""The Family."" Leatherface, Choptop, Chilly dad, and Grandpa are in there and they have the distinct advantage of knowing the ins and outs of that place.  Through this maze Stretch is hunted down and exposed to various trials and horrors. The psychologist Sigmund Freud was particularly fascinated by this mythic scenario and stated that the Minotaur Maze comes from deep within the human psyche.  It is a way our subconscious deals with the trials of daily survival and lifetime adaptation as we mature.At the end of the movie, we are treated to a display of complete disregard for proper operating instructions concerning the chainsaw.  Dennis Hopper does battle with Leatherface, chainsaw versus chainsaw, and they hack away at eachother as if they had swords.  I think the chain would probably break! I thought of the old swashbuckling movies as the two of them did battle on top of the dinner table.  Leatherface again does his pattented chainsaw side-to-side dance and it proves to be the death of him.  Because Dennis Hopper, instead of dancing, siezes the moment to stab the chainsaw ALL THE WAY THROUGH Leatherface.  However, Leatherface continues to fight!  He is hard core!And, of course, to round out the pyschological terror and make some sort of character arc, at the end, Stretch masters the chainsaw and uses it to kill Choptop.  In fact, after killing Choptop, she does a little chainsaw dance of her own!Now, I will comment on part of the movie that really impressed me! Choptop's death scene.  I am refering to what appears to be one heck of a great STUNT!  Choptop falls off the top of a tower and ROLLS down a SUPER STEEP ROCK FACE and directly in to a METAL TUBE.  This fall appears to be about 20 or 25 feet.  I was IMPRESSED!  This did not look like a dummy! That looked like a STUNT GUY did that STUNT!  Anybody ever try to do their own stunts?  Let me tell you, that looked SCARY!  If you don't SMASH YOUR BRAINS ON THE ROCK, then you will most likely SLAM in to the corner of that tube!  You have to hit it just right, and that stunt guy rolled over BACKWARDS on his way DOWN!  That is amazing!  If that was indeed a stunt, and not a dummy, I am super impressed.  It looked like a real stunt guy, so I am going with that.  But it appears to be such a scary stunt, I don't know where they found a stunt guy to do it!  It seems like kind of a shame, because that scene is over so quick and no one seems to care about that stunt.  That was a good stunt!Overall, this is a fun horror movie.  I laughed a lot, but it has some really disturbing parts too!  Such as the part with Grandpa trying to brain poor Stretch.  That was disturbing.  Not exactly a ""date movie.""  Also the weird part where Leatherface chainsaws beer cans and sprays Stretch with chainsawed beer.  That was just strange.  If you have a sense of humor, you will probably be entertained by this movie.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Imagine if ""Jaws2"" was actually a musical, with Roy Scheider tap-dancing thru half the movie. That just doesn't work as a concept. And neither does TCM2 as comedy.Even worse, the comedy isn't funny. It's bad. I mean, terrible.

This was the first ""unrated"" film I ever saw in the theaters in 1986, and I have to admit seeing it because it was unrated. I was not disappointed, either, it is a very entertaining ride. Yes, the production was definitely rushed, and maybe even too-much time had elapsed since the original in 1974, but we'll call this one ""family""--warts-and-all! First: a lot of the plot is just stupid, especially the subplot with Dennis Hopper, the brother of the annoying-asshole in the wheelchair from the original. Frankly, the guy in the wheelchair was so annoying, it's hard to empathize with the Hopper character, since I'm glad his brother got-killed. :0) The chainsaw between the heroine's legs was pretty sexy, too. I did think the recording of the radio call-in was well-done, though, it was very disturbing. The film also boasts some excellent-gore by Tom Savini, including a scalping and a character losing his face to Leatherface.Again, the ""yuppie-prologue"" was great in 1986, but does look a little dated today, although there will always be assholes like that who die in the Tobe Hooper universe. That makes it OK. But like a number of good horror films, it somehow rises-above all the ""problems"", and still works. It mixes humor and horror well, and there were a number of times it was hard to look at the screen. I also liked the chili-judging contest section, which was a real hoot, and more of Hooper's commentary on animal-cruelty (apparently, some vegetarians LOVE this aspect of both films). Like most Tobe Hooper films, it looks well-lensed and composed, especially the underground-den of the cannibal family, is damned creepy. The true standout is actor Bill Mosley's performance as ""plate-head"", he's what makes some of the classic moments in the film. He's funny AND creepy-as-hell. If he reminds me of anyone, it would be Tex Watson of the Manson Family, and there are a few submerged-references to them in TCM2. His best-line: ""Awwwwww, Leatherface, you done' ruined my Sonny Bono wig!!"" He's the best, and on-par with Jeffrey Combs as a horror character-actor, just sublime.It's good to see Tobe Hooper doing hardcore-horror again (I loved ""Toolbox Murders""), and I hope to see his ""Mortuary"" soon, it sounds excellent and funny like this one. If there is one thing that distinguishes Tobe Hooper's films, it is his oddball sense-of-humor and physical humor in horror. It's almost like combining elements of Lon Chaney with Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Some balk that you can watch the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a comedy, but it's true--it's pretty-funny, and relatively bloddless! This one will make you laugh, even as you cringe! Tobe Hooper makes films about what scares him, and he copes with it through humor. Besides, the audience has to have some kind of outlet for material this strong. This is where he is similar to Stuart Gordon, who also ultilizes comedy to give us all a break from the horror! I have heard rumors that the theatrical and video-cuts are incomplete, and that Hooper had a much ""wetter"" cut of the film, but that the producers and distributors balked. I'd sure like to see that! The MGM DVD is passable, and has a good transfer, but just offers the trailer, which is paltry. Still, they at least offered it widescreen, which is its best presentation.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
113,drahulrajjsd,Tobe Hooper's 80s Classic!,10,27 March 2018,"It's 8.30pm over here, on the 27th of March. Today is the birthday of one of my favorite horror icons, Ms. Caroline Williams. To celebrate, my special feature of the night will be a movie that she's very well known for; the movie that made her into a massive horror icon. It is the original sequel from the late great master of horror, Tobe Hooper, and it is one of the best sequels and films ever made: 1986's, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. It's a sequel that never gets old, and I just absolutely love watching it over and over again. There is an unforgettable performance from the amazing and iconic Caroline Williams, as a radio DJ, Stretch, and I find her character to be very bold, brave, and beautiful. This is also the movie that made Bill Moseley into a massive horror icon, for his funny and menacing performance as Leatherface's brother, Chop Top, which I find to be very cool and hilarious. And, as well, there is an unforgettable performance by Bill Johnson, as Leatherface, with him licking his lips, the way he moves, and the way he's swinging around his chainsaw. There are also awesome performances from late legends, Jim Siedow and Dennis Hopper. It's a horrifying sequel with the mixture of romance and comedy, plus you've got super-cool 80's hits and mind blowing special-effects from the Guru of Gore himself, Tom Savini. It's more than just a masterpiece of a feature, and I feel Hollywood should really be doing a direct sequel to this chapter, and mainly bringing back both Caroline Williams as Stretch, and Bill Moseley as Chop Top Sawyer, rather than wasting all their talents and time on remakes, prequels, etc.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

115,Sorpse,Best TCM sequel,10,23 February 2013,"currently there are 6 TCM movies out and this movie has yet to be topped. it is in my opinion the best sequel to TCM. Every other film in this franchise has basically been a remake of the origonal with slight changes and TCM2 is easilly the most origonal. SPOILERS First of all they change the setting, instead of taking place at a house this one is in a abandoned cole mine. I thought this was a great place to have the hideout and allowed for some original scares. Another change was the characters. Of course we have the famous leatherface character but for the only time in TCM history (including the following 4 sequels/remakes/prequels)there are actually some likable characters. The sheriff was badass. The scene of him having a chainsaw battle with leatherface who is battling with a chainsaw through the stomache was awesome. Also just the scenes of the sheriff holding the duel chainsaws was great. The female lead 'stretch' also did a great job. in horror movies a lot of the time we are treated to sub par acting but the actress who played stretch did a very good job. A returning character was grandpa who came back for the essential dinner scene and looks uglier than ever, One other notable moment was when stretch is forced to wear the skin of her coworker who wakes up and has a conversation with her while she wearing his face! this was cool stuff. Even better is when hes doing his signature 'spit' so you are reminded who the guy with no face is haha. Again i say this is by far the second best chainsaw massacre after 6 installments. The ending was super cool too with stretch standing atop the mine swinging the chainsaw, memorable stuff.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

117,spencer-w-hensley,Nowhere near as good as the first but watchable and decent for a sequel,7,26 June 2021,"The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film I personally feel did not need a sequel.For a low budget film it was well done and its cliffhanger ending was satisfactory enough that the movie didnt desperately need a follow up.However in the years since its release the film grew substantially in popularity so a sequel for better or worse was inevitable.Surprisingly this sequel is decent enough although much inferior to the original.It's never boring and the story has enough steady pacing to keep you involved.Dennis Hopper, although not giving a bad performance I feel is miscast here. His role although he is top billed is underdeveloped and more backstory of his character would have made a better movie.Hopper was very much a hit and miss actor considering the projects he chose later in his career and 1986 was certainly one of his busiest years ever as he appeared in this, Hoosiers, Blue Velvet and River's Edge.Sadly this particular script is one not really worthy of his talent as his role could have been played by just about anyone. Keeping in mind he was also nominated for an Oscar for Hoosiers the very same year this film sadly does not utilize him as well as that one did.The rest of the movie is decent enough if not a retread of the original. But again I was never bored which is why I mildly recommend this sequel.There are many better sequels out there to be sure but there are also many, many worse. I would take this second installment any day over Rocky IV and V, Grease 2, Speed 2 (another sequel to a popular movie featuring Hopper coincidentally), and Caddyshack 2.Does that make this a great movie? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Yes. If you want to turn your brain off and kill some time with a passable sequel this will satisfy.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

With great over the top performances and more gore than the first film, and the only TCM movie to feature an actor from the first film, this should have been the last TCM movie made. I also thought that this film had that same feel as the original 1974 classic. I guess that a lot of people get lost in the humor of the film, but I also thought that it helped set the pace. The only thing that I find wrong with the film was the fact that one of the people had been hit with a hammer many times over, and after his face had been cut off, he still is alive.

121,meurernick,So Much Fun,8,10 October 2020,"I love watching this movie. A total 180 from the original 1974 film. In my honest opinion, I didn't really enjoy Leatherface/Bubba in this film. In the original Gunnar Hansen was a hulking monster of a man who you would scare you just by looking at you. And while he did have some comedic moments, like putting on the different masks to look ""pretty"", he was still terrifying. In the second film, Leatherface seemed way too dumb and incompetent, and they tried to make him too likable. A character I did enjoy though, was Chop Top. The fact that Bill Moseley was such a huge fan, Tobe Hooper basically couldn't say no to him being in the movie is so inspiring. Chop Top was extremely uncomfortable and funny to watch. Picking at his scalp and eating it, talking about how important music is. He's hilarious and has quickly become one of my favorite characters in all of cinema. Dennis Hopper was funny as well, especially with his ""bring it all down""! He was also a good character, because he had a very good method for hunting down the Sawyers. Drayton and Grandpa Sawyer both added more comedic and scary moments. The close up on Grandpa's face was kind of horrifying. The last character, Stretch. I really enjoyed Stretch as a character. She was strong, smart, funny, and didn't take anyone's s**t. I just think there was just a bit too much screaming. I really enjoyed the production design.

123,DevastationBob-3,Dumber than you'd think,1,28 October 2006,"Potential SPOILERS ahead.When I'd first heard of this movie, it was described to me by my cousins as the scariest and creepiest movie they'd ever seen. So it always had a place in my mind as a movie to avoid. However, when I finally did catch it, I have to say I disagree.This movie was incredibly stupid. Every scare is telegraphed, nothing is a surprise. Leatherface dances around more with the chainsaw then cutting anyone. It's really idiotic. The performances aren't much better than your local churches haunted house on Halloween.First, we're supposed to believe a radio station can't hang up on a caller unless the caller does first? I think the FCC would have something to say about that. It'd be impossible to censor any obscene calls that way. Also, what exactly does the tape reveal that Chop Top and Leatherface need to show up and silence the girl about? Some screams and a chainsaw noise. Yeah, that really points out their identities and existence. A damn autopsy would reveal the cause of death was power tool. Beyond that there's NOTHING linking them. Texas is a damn big state. And as the prologue indicates, after the first girl was found alive, the authorities found NOTHING to prove the events had happened. Plus, they could have just torched the place when they left the girl if they really wanted to be sure.I watched it a second time last night, and I have to say it's gotten dumber.

For a decade, Taxes Ranger ""Lefty"" Enright (Dennis Hopper) has been trying to chase down the cannibalistic Sawyer family that killed his brother Franklin 12 years ago. With no help from the local police. Lefty with the help of a local disk jockey, find the Sawyer's underground butcher shop and take matters into there own hands.Tope Hooper returns to the helm to tell another chilling story and the evil Leatherface and his overpowering chainsaw. The main story was written by L.M. Kit Carson and it was released by the now bankrupted company Cannon films. This film was banned in some country's for 20 years for it's gore and graphic violence, but only two people get killed by the chainsaw in this movie and it's gore isn't as bad as some of the other movies I've seen. The recent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" made in 2006 was a lot worst then this, the gore which was shown in that film made this one look like it was G rated. But I guess they had different rules back in 1986 when this film was released to the public.The Taxes Chainsaw Massacre 2 isn't as good as the original. The bigger budget, cheap scares, length and it's comedy was the major flaws in this movie which could had been a lot better. The film does lag half way through once they enter the underground butcher shop.

127,butterman_1999,Rare uncut work print VHS version sheds light,7,18 October 2017,"**** WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS **** I apologize in advance if I am unable to offer any details concerning the nature of the VHS tape I am about to review, since I am writing this while at work..That being said, ""TCM 2"" as widely seen in its truncated format is a true testament to everything which was wrong about 80s gore horror, and censorship through the MPAA (Motion Picture Aputators of America). I recall how my brother had read up on this film in horror magazines, and our subsequent disappointment when having finally rented the highly edited censored VHS release, about a year after it's theatrical run. For the longest time, I knew the film itself had been butchered into it's widespread version and that so much was left out, much to the chagrin of gore hounds and those who expected at least a semblance of a follow-up to the 70s original classic.For all most people know (based on what version they have been exposed to), this is quite simply bad movie, heavily edited by studios and distributors.Years after I had long forgotten about how horrid a censored film this was had passed, an ex-friend of mine managed to pick up for me at a yard sale a widescreen version of the film on VHS tape. This was not the same widely seen version of the VHS tape we had seen collecting dust in good old video rental stores (anyone remember those?) and so at first I thought it was a well executed bootleg of sorts. After a long pause I decided to watch it since, at the very least, I had never seen it in widescreen format.To my surprise (especially since this was in no way advertised in any form) it turns out that the version of ""TCM 2"" on this tape was what most people would have referred to as the ""workprint"" version. Running at just about 2 hours, it featured most of the usuable uncensored footage never seen before, finally making the film ""make sense"" (if that is at all possible with such a film!). Add to this, again un-advertised, that after the feature, a series of additional deleted footage is present, included that of the infamous Leatherface goes after an entire team of college football players. However, as opposed to the included re-inserted footage in the film, these bonus scenes are of an atrocious quality, looking as though they were filmed on portable video Equipment of the era.In conclusion, my opinion of the film itself was changed after that viewing, and finally I was able to appreciate the deviant, unhealthy, and downright visually and intellectually/morally disturbing vision of Tobe Hooper, since this version is probably closer to what he had originally intended rather than the butchered beyond comprehension version most of us have been exposed to.Afterthoughts: The early Y2K DVD re-release of the film is the edited version (as the widespread commercial VHS release), and apparently this ""workprint"" or ""uncut"" version on VHS remains unreleased. It's a shame because it elevates the film from a badly executed parody of the original to an actually semi-disturbing film with more gore to please that target audience.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

He arms himself with three chainsaws and infiltrates their underground hideout after Stretch is kidnapped. It seems that Leatherface has a huge crush on her, and apparently wants to keep her alive despite the protests of his brothers. Lefty finally arrives at the lair of the murderous psychopaths ready to exact his revenge. But the evil cannibals aren't going to go down without a fight. Let's rev up the chainsaws and go at it! This followup to one of the greatest horror films of all time takes a completely different approach than the original and I, for one, completely respected that. It's hard to capture that kind of magic twice in a row. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 is gorier, more action packed, and way more humorous. This movie is filled with several scenes of slapstick comedy which, in my opinion, serve the film very well. Lefty, played by the always excellent Dennis Hopper, is one of the coolest horror film protagonists ever and his determination to bring the demented Sawyer family down is what kept me so entertained while watching this awesome flick. He and Caroline Williams have great chemistry. I also thought that Bill Johnson was a great Leatherface (though he comes nowhere near Gunnar Hansen) and loved seeing Jim Siedow reprise his role as Drayton from the first movie. Chop Top (played by genre favorite Bill Moseley), an extension of the Hitchhiker character from the original, is a really fun character and stole every scene he was in. I really loved the underground tunnel setting as well. This film isn't without its flaws (that ending seemed rushed and was way too abrupt) but the groovy chainsaw duel during the climax of the film more than makes up for it.

There were times when I really thought it might be going somewhere, then there were moments that I thought were stupid or goofy. I believe this movie is meant as a parody of the original TCM. I liked some of the humor in it, particularly the scene where Dennis Hopper goes to the chain saw store. I can't help but think that the movie could have easily been better than what it is, since there is some good material in it. I liked the idea of Stretch getting a murder on tape at the very beginning of the movie, and this putting her in danger. That's a pretty good idea, but there's so many strange moments in it that seem to take away from it.As it may sound, I'm still trying to sort out my thoughts on this movie.

And not just any amusement park, it has seemingly endless lattice of tunnels and brightly-lit caverns underneath. It's hard to feel afraid of what is clearly a bad movie set.THE VILLAIN: I'll start with Leatherface. In TCM1, Leatherface is a barbaric violent villain, a sick effed-up killing MACHINE. Here, Leatherface wields his chainsaw at a 'pretty' (?) girl, falls in love with her, and becomes a BIG OLD SOFTY. He turns into Ludo the Lovable Oaf from ""Labyrinth"" (or, for Harry Potter fans, Grawp). I'm sorry but WHAT THE ****? Is this a horror movie or a children's film??? THE HEROINE: Stretch is a radio DJ who wears little denim shorts but as the face of a goat. She is also the stupidest heroine I've ever met in a horror film. She actively pursues the villains to their base, with no plan and without contacting the police, and falls right into their hands. It's hard to care about her suffering when she so clearly deserves it for being such a fool.THE HERO: Dennis Hopper, like his female counterpart, also decides to take on the villains single-handedly. He buys a bunch of chainsaws and goes after them on his own. Yep - strapping a few chainsaws to your back like Rambo is a GREAT survival technique.Now, I love horror movies and I LOVE horror sequels - even bad ones.

135,dung_rat,A moderate black comedy...,5,15 January 2002,"It is generally regarded by most that this is but a mere shadow of its former self.'TCSM 2' is a disappointing horror film yet it does work surprisingly well as a black comedy. The film appears far too 'polished' compared to its predecessor, which was renowned for its grainy and dark visuals.Many people actually perceived the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' as a kind of macabre sort-of-comedy. In fact, I remember when it was finally released in the UK a few years ago; I was one of the only people squeezed into a small local cinema who wasn't laughing at it. To be honest I found the killings in 'TCSM' rather harrowing. Perhaps many thought it was funny to see 'Leatherface' blunder about the place making a bizarre series of (what can best be described as) 'squeals'!Tobe Hooper appears to have picked up on that particular trend and 'TCSM 2' is a decidedly postmodern film; comprising of many elements from the original and several other horror films. It is indeed a type of pastiche yet it contains too much comedy to be labelled so. The fact that it seems to be mocking itself and its predecessor means that it is parodic.Also, unlike the original, the killings in 'TCSM 2' are shown in their full splendour. While Hooper opted to use a series of close-up shots of people being killed in 'TCSM', here, we are not denied that privilege. The opening killing where a man has the top of his head sliced off with a chainsaw just goes to prove this: and the fact that this wound results in blood spraying almost relentlessly is quite disturbing, if not somewhat hilarious.    
I didn't give this film a particularly high grade ('5') but it isn't as bad as some people have made out; at the same time though, it isn't a patch on the original. The film is alive with cheesy one-liners and harsh language. Jim Siedow's performance as 'Cook' is goofily amusing. I agree with some other people who have commented on this film; Dennis Hopper is adequate enough but he appears to be out-of-place. It's a real shame that Gunnar Hansen (who I had the pleasure of meeting 2 years ago) wasn't playing 'Leatherface'.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
136,imad_jafar,A definite classic!,7,8 February 2010,"This shocking - and bizarre - sequel to director Tobe Hooper's own 1974 original is one of the greatest slasher films of the past thirty years. It has, however, been overlooked by both critics and fans, who, in the past, have detested and misunderstood it's rich combination of insane black comedy and harrowing horror. Perhaps they were expecting another disturbingly suggestive nightmare like the first ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" - this just seemed so immature with it's scenes of explicit violence. It's zany style, coupled with Dennis Hopper's maniacal performance, is, however, a masterstroke that Hooper manages to pull off surprisingly well. The movie bursts with inventive Gothic satire and an unrelenting energy so powerful that it deserves to have it's own position as a landmark fright flick. This is one slasher film that is a must-see for any true fan of the sub-genre.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Hopper was pretty smart up until near the end when he makes one fatal and stupid mistake. Spoiler Alert!!!!!?Leatherface was boring also not the least bit scary and even the violence was more comical then graphic or shocking as it was in the original film.The ""comedy"" was laughable and felt misplaced making this already nonsensical mind f!*# deranged film feel even more messed up.The ending is hilariously bad and just like most of this film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.This one should have never even saw the light of day not even Hopper normally reliable could save this one.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

It's a very different film than the first - some defenders of it think that you have to judge it on its own terms. Okay, I am, and it's awful. I like good horror movies. I even like bad ones that are fun to watch. This is just painful. It's not scary, it's not even that gory, and it ain't funny either. It's all screams and blaring chainsaws...not my idea of fun. Dull, plot less and pointless.Does it make me feel like I'm losing my mind watching it? Yes. Does that make it good? Hell no. Avoid at all costs. Seriously, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
139,Joshua_Penczek,"""Dog will hunt!""",6,30 September 2018,"I saw this film in my early teenage years and absolutely hated it. Years have gone by before I finally saw it again for a second time just last night, and while it's certainly not better or anywhere near close to being as good as the original, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 really isn't that bad of a movie. Many have expressed negative feelings towards the goofy comedic tone, but I personally didn't feel too much of that in the film. Even years ago I remember the film being much sillier and even slapsticky than it was just last night. To me, the film is certainly tongue-in-cheek and doesn't take itself seriously, mostly with Dennis Hopper's bombastic climax, but it's still layered in horror, darkness, and disturbing imagery. Scenes where Leatherface forces a girl to dance with him while she wears the skinned face of her best friend like a mask are remescent of the nightmare-like trances from the first. The character of Chop-Top is also a nice addition to the film, and I found his introduction to the movie where he rambles on about nonsense for 10 minutes while picking at his scalp with a shirt hanger to still be in the same macabre vein as the first. In fact, most of the characters are pretty well written and acted, with the exception fin Dennis Hopper, who is easily the worst thing about this movie and a complete waste of an excellent actor. Hopper later went on to claim that his role in this movie was the worst of his entire career, and I can certainly see why he'd say that.Tobe Hooper has had a very lackluster career; in fact, I might even say he's only ever made one great film, that being the original TCM. This film proves that he still had an understanding for good camerawork and sudden thrills, like a scene where Leatherface leaps from darkness in the middle of a 10 minute dialog scene. The original was full with some of the best scares in cinematic history, while this film only attempts it once or twice. It's disappointing because the few times it tries to scare, it genuinely works, and it makes you wish there was more of it.Also, the film just ends. No resolution, no epilogue, it doesn't even finish the climax. It just ends. That gives it a sort of grindhouse feel, but it's still quite underwhelming. Overall the film is a lot more horrifying than most make it out to be, but it's still not as near as horrifying as it should be. I feel like a few tweaks could've made this movie really good, maybe even a close companion to the first, but it distracted and differed from Tobe Hooper's vision of the film.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
140,Tippy_Cup,Meh.,5,22 July 2008,"I'm a REALLY big fan of the original TCM, I hadn't seen this for a while so I got it out today, and just finished watching it.From the very outset I knew something was wrong as the voice over, is reading the fill in a little too fast. It kind of makes you realise that the whole film came about in the same way. The ideas were put to paper a little too fast, there wasn't enough time just having it sit in the writers head growing, and becoming refined.The nest part of the intro, the ten minutes with the frat boys shooting signs and then playing chicken with the wrong hill billies, was awful, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth that pretty much sticks around for the rest of the movie. The tone and pace of the whole sequence is so different to the rest of the film, it just doesn't even fit in right, and a much better re-introduction of the maniacal family was really in order.The comical bits were pretty stupid, as if that was the direction they wanted to go in, it should've been very dark humour...It could've been very disturbingly funny. The end scene in the original with the grandpa trying to bludgeon the girl with the hammer is pretty powerful, one of the few scenes in any movie that scares me a little, it feels like your in the same messed up situation. The end scene in this is just....meh.If the film was more dark, the final shot in this, mirroring the final shot of leather face in the first. Again would've been powerful and really effective.Bill Moseley asking if the tape was from the Rambo 3 soundtrack was retarded, not just because the movie only came out two years after this (I just looked that up, didn't know it off the top of my head), which could've still made sense and is not necessarily a goof. But it doesn't make sense that the family would know what Rambo was, as they are segregated from society and only the dad interacts with other people.I liked the chilli cook off idea. That worked well with the black humour theme, it's just too bad everything else they tried didn't.Once again Tobe Hooper shows of his ability to shot the exterior's of buildings really well. Actually I think many of his shots in this were good. Just the script killed it self.5/10",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
141,Seamus-25,A bit of a laugh,5,24 January 2002,"I didn't expect much when I started watching this at 2am one morning but I was a little surprised to find it's not so bad. The acting is way over the top from all fronts (with the exception of Caroline Williams who plays Stretch). The story is very silly but quite funny at times. Dennis Hopper although supposedly in a leading role is not really in it much - his action mainly off screen (you hear him going buck mad with a chainsaw) - no the best actor for me was the guy who plays the brother with the metal plate in his head (I can't remember his name)-  he seemed to relish the over the top style and played it with gusto. The set design was quite incredible in the final scenes with lots of interconnected rooms and pipes making Leatherface's house look like a adventure park under the ground. The film is a comedy with added gore as opposed to a horror movie with added comedy - if you see it with this frame of mind you may enjoy it more.
I gave this a 5 - Interesting film - not great but not terrible (unless you hate gore)",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
142,Tics,The Saw Returns.,4,14 February 1999,"The sequel to one of the, in my opinion biggest horror movies of all time. And it really sucks, not just as a sequel but as any kind of movie. It is really bad but it still got good actors, some good scenes and a little gore. Returning once more is the cannibal family from the first movie. Two guys heading through texas call the local radio station to wise-off and are soon killed by the family. The radio host meet up with a revengeful police officer (excellently played by Dennis Hopper) and together they go after the family.The cook, grandpa and of course Leatherface return for more cannibalistic horror. But the movie turns really boring, it tries not to be like the first movie and because of this it doesn't grow to any plot. It just feels stupid and some of the scenes are direct copies of the first movie. Stupid and not a bit interesting.

144,ashleybrownmedia,Terrible.,2,26 October 2013,"I had just watched last year's (2012) Texas Chainsaw and Netflix recommended I watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, as the original was undoubtedly a classic of the genre I agree and settled to watch it - the fact that an actor of Dennis Hopper's calibre was in it made me think it might be even better - even though we all know that often horror sequels are no good.What I sat through was quite frankly terrible. I'm by no means a prude when it comes to cinema, I have see countless B-movies and schlock films but this, well, I just couldn't enjoy it at all. What is it that is so bad about it? Well, to put it quite simply, this is actually in the horror/comedy genre and not in the 'its so bad its good' way. Why on earth they would possibly want to make the sequel to what was such a gory, dark and disturbing film a comedy is beyond me. All I know is that it doesn't work at all.Basically two drunken losers, who are driving to a party, call into a radio show and won't get off the line. The presenter ends up hearing them die at the hands of the Texas Chainsaw family and for some reason she thinks this tape of random sound effects will help the police. She meets Hopper's character - a Texas Ranger who is hot on the trail of the family due to some family member's murder. The two have very little screen time together but still try and work together to sort things out.Having said that there are two scenes that are actually disturbing - one of them is when Grandpa is trying to hit the Radio Presenter with a hammer and the other is when she finds her friend LG towards the end. But you'll see what I mean if you are unfortunate enough to watch this.So yeah, there we go a horror comedy that isn't funny and might have worked with a better script and the realisation that it would be better suited as a straight out horror piece.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

I gave it a 3 out of 10 because it is just disappointing the the original, in the original they let a girl get away and shouldn't that girl have told the police about the murderers? The thing should have been all over. If this was a sequel it should have been about the beginning of it all. Not into the future. The movie just made no sense. If you get the time right, Leatherface was 34 in the first movie, if this movie takes place 13 years later. He should be 47. So they been at for 17 years? How did they go from a house to an abandon circus. Did they move? So did they just leave all the other dead body parts in the other house and drive in their truck? They snuck in the circus and moved there? How did they get their victims? More people wanted to sneak in or did Leatherface come out of the circus and look for victims. In some scenes in ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2"" you can see Leatherface comes into houses and cars to kill his victims, then he brings their bodies. Then he butchers them at the circus. So it's a bit stupid. In the original people would go INTO the house and die. In this movie people would be kidnapped.Overall the movie sucked.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
147,MALPRACTICE,Sad that so few understand this films utter greatness...,10,12 October 2001,"When Tobe Hooper gave us his second vision of TCM, many fans were buzzing with excitement... by the time it was released they were split in many sects, not quite understanding what they had witnessed. Was it a new film? A tribute perhaps? Could it ever live up the cult following the original had garnered? Well, it not only lives up to it but also etched its own special place in horror history. With Tom Savini's incredible effects and Hoopers masterful and creepy scene progression this film showed why the 80's were such a fun time to be a horror fan. Let me be straight about this: It IS NOT PART 1! It could never be that film, and quite frankly why would they revisit it? You can never re-capture that kind of raw ferocity unless you totally re-made the film, and what fun would that be? Instead Hooper took a low monotone and brooding soundtrack, coupled with a heaping helping of psycho sexual tension, some very dark comic moments and made one hell of a sequel. Dennis Hopper is good here, but Jim Siedow and Bill Moseley really steal the show giving a Psychotic and hilarious tone to several crazy scenes. Not to be outdone, Caroline Williams shows why today's horror films are so lame... they don't have a real scream queen! She really puts in a great performance. Bill Johnson is great as Leatherface too, he may not be Gunnar Hansen but at the same time he's his own Leatherface, and a damn good one at that. Lastly Savini's FX is top Notch, and really sets the tone with its quality workmanship. All in all its not for everyone, but for those horror fans who do ""get it"" its a special treat not to be missed.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
148,antoinecatry,Correct and much worthier of attention compared to other sequels,7,15 January 2009,"With these lines, I classify TCM 2 as a good and pertinent sequel. I was a 12 year old full of acne when I first rented it at the nearest videostore and completely ignorant at the time of the first one because French cultural institutions were still very reticent towards shocking works-of-art. I recently re watched TCM 2 on DVD and, in possession of many elements of comparison between the 2 films, I am not afraid to put it on an equal level of quality next to its predecessor for the followings :1) It is a motivated and consistent sequel : the murderous and cannibalistic family is still on the loose. An atrocious series of crimes remained unpunished, which justifies the part of Dennis Hopper, uncle of the Hardestys. 2) The way he accomplishes his vengeance brings laugh, the lone and mystic ranger way, like an angel of retribution with God and saws on his side. The change of tonality was severely criticized but let's face it, had Tobe Hooper filmed the same first-degree tale of horror, fans would have been much harsher. This mixture of western and horror makes it an original and entertaining sequel. So please don't crucify the creator too much ! 3) As in the first one, analysis can be added to pleasure. No matter what savagery the Sawyers commit, they are still victims of recession, unemployment and automation, not just plain psycho-killers. The introduction of Chop Top, Viet Nam veteran brother to Leatherface, constitutes a real point of interest : the superimposition of one tale of historic horror to another one in film. This, in my opinion, refutes any accusation of trivialized violence. Last but not least, the impossible romance of Leatherface simulating a penetration with his saw rather turns him more into a pathetic than crude individual. We would almost sympathize. 4) Some touches of macabre and amoral humor are really enjoyable : the chili contest won by a certain ""Sawyer"". Would we realize it if we were fed human flesh ? Would we savor it if we were told it was a secret of longevity (cf 137 years old Granpa Sawyer) ? This disturbs and amuses at the same time the horror fan that I am. As a conclusion, in spite of its commercial failure of the time, this film deserves reconsideration in memory of an age long forgotten, when horror films were not all merely franchises targeted to sex freak teenagers. Ever since what has followed TCM 2, there has not been a single ounce of creativity or interest, apart from a few gore novelties and demonstrations of free sadism : TCM 3 is not about the same family, TCM 4 is just terrible, the 2003 remake and its prequel do not mention cannibalism and clumsily try to tell the youth of Leatherface without any explanation about how he came to be what he is, pointless. TCM and TCM 2 form an efficient diptych to spike a night of boredom or weary tranquility. If you have not seen the others yet, don't waste your time trying !",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

150,rexdaugherty,Solid chainsaw sequel,10,25 March 2007,Let me just start off by saying this is a really good sequel to the original. Bill Mosely as chop top was great. That is probably my favorite character in the movie. I also like the cook a lot as well. The reason I didn't like as much as the first or third Texas Chainsaw Massacres is it's not quiet as hard hitting as those films. But the film works really for what it is which is a very dark comedy which another I reason I don't like as much as parts 1 and 3. Is the film good? Yeah it's damn good. Is it as good as the original? No but none of them are. This film is just said a very good and solid sequel in the series.,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

(SPOILER) The grandpa hammering scene, the chainsaw duel, the Lefty demolition, Leatherface's love, Chop Top himself, are Trash in concept. As for the chainsaw duel, here's a bit of physics: conservation of angular momentum makes the chainsaw unwieldy to swing, so the duel would be quite tough in real life.

The main issues with this from a production point, the original's charm came from its low budget and use of a 16mm camera, while 2 had a much higher budget I guess with a 35mm camera and looks as slick as a 70mm camera. The acting performances for the most part are from season performers where the original they were for the most part just starting out just as Tobe Hopper was. I understand that Cannon released this movie and did a complete re edit. This in itself would explain all the problems that everyone has found with it, and I would hope to find a director's cut of this movie some day.

153,madscientist2787,Humor,7,14 June 2006,"The description of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 sounds like a recipe for an unarguably perfect horror sequel. The cannibalistic family are still up to their usual hijinks, and Dennis Hopper stars as an ex-Federal Marshal who has sworn revenge for the deaths of his brother's kids in the first film. There's a bigger movie budget this time, allowing for the family to relocate from their farmhouse to an labyrinthine underground lair beneath a cheesy tourist attraction which looks like something out of a Mario Bava film. A screenplay by L.M. Kit Carson (Paris, Texas) and makeup effects by Tom Savini. The first death in the film is a 90-mile-an-hour car chase/chainsaw-induced head wound set to Oingo Boingo's song ""No One Lives Forever""... now look me in the eye, and tell me that that doesn't sound better than Citizen Kane? As fate would have it, though, this film is actually completely terrible. It's about as far removed from its predecessor as Killer Klowns from Outer Space is from Psycho. I don't know how, or why, but some idiot somewhere decided to play this film for yucks. Presumably, their reasoning was that it would be too hard to try and outdo the original in terms of grueling ferocity, so they opted instead to mix the gore with slapstick. It might have looked good on paper, but the filmmakers amped the goofiness up to eleven and it really all falls to pieces.Replacing Edwin Neal in the role of The Hitchhiker is Bill Moseley, who is 1,000,000 times more irritating here than he is in the overrated The Devil's Rejects. Prancing about, picking his metal-domed head with a rusty coathanger (don't ask) and giggling manically like an evil Jimmy Fallon, he embodies about everything that is wrong with this movie. Well, just about everything, because then there's also Leatherface. Gone is the unstoppable, ruthless killing machine we all know and love, and in his place, we have a puppy-eyed, Quasimodoesque lunkhead with a strange preference towards dry-humping young women with the aid of his chainsaw instead of chopping them to bits without hesitation. I can only assume Hooper was going for some kind of Blue Velvet parody here... which brings us to Mr. Hopper. Even when he's tearing around the family's lair, slicing everyone and everything up with his chainsaw and shouting ""I am the Lord of the Harvest!!!"" at the top of his lungs, he still looks bored and confused. ""One for them"" indeed.Amazingly, this film actually does have a substantial fanbase. Many of them insist that anyone who doesn't like this film could only be an unpleasable complaint-artist who wouldn't be satisfied with anything that wasn't exactly like the original.

Having said that, I find it hard to believe the bashing and bad reputation treatment this film has had from the critics and many viewers.I think Hooper did very wisely when he didn't try to duplicate the first one's very disturbing and authentic feel. Instead, we have way more light hearted and comedy-based film that is like a roller coaster ride through some very tasteless violence and morbid fun. And still, while this is a horror-comedy, it still succeeds in surprising you from time to time and pulling the carpet off from under your feet, just when you thought it was safe to laugh.Please, people; take this film as it is, by it's own merits.

156,zuccozoid,Leatherface in Love??,2,6 January 2010,"The original TCM_1, like the original JAWS, should never have been ""remade"" or recycled. TCM_1 was a product of its time, and truly inspired. It relied on claustrophobic atmosphere, believable characters and implied violence. Very tough to watch with the lights out - especially alone. TCM_2 is simply ridiculous. Gone is the nightmarish claustrophobia, the shadows and sense of impending doom. This sequel goes for ""black comedy"" but instead makes a parody of itself.We get way, WAY too much of the crazy jabbering bad guys, especially Chop Top, who never shuts up. The villains' dialog is almost vaudevillian in its oneupmanship of pseudo-clever lines. Leatherface literally falls in love with our Heroine. They repeat the entire Grandpa's dinner scene from the original.Since this was supposedly about our cannibal clan (hiding in an abandoned amusement park) capturing and killing people to make chili they serve at state fairs (!) wouldn't it've been cooler to have the baddies force our Heroine to EAT it - rather than repeat the same scenes from the original? Nothing here except a lot of gore, noise and bombast, all amounting to nothing.To be fair, we're not in HOBGOBLINS territory here. But the final shot, with our short-shorts babe doing a chainsaw jiggle dance - makes me wonder what the heck they were smoking.George Romero (with a lot of help from Dario Argento) made a grand leap from the bleak horror of NOTLD to DAWN, with sharp social commentary, and the humor, such as it is in DAWN, is well placed: it's NOT a comedy.All of TCM_2 should have been left on the cutting room floor, so to speak.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

I taped this movie a year ago, and since then, I must have seen it over 80 times! I only realised that when a year had passed, I had watched the film 9 times that day. Secondly, ALL of the actors in this movie did a BRILLIANT job. I think Dennis portraid a brilliant character, a little insane, but a great character, I won't go into too much info about how great his acting was, because he admitted he gets a bit spooked when people say he was great in his movies(also mentioning this movie). Caroline Williams; Wow! A brilliant actress that brought courage, sexiness and humour to the film, and that's just talking about the character she played! Bill Moseley; What a hoot! Great guy. I've talked to him a few times, and he is great. Great humour and...a weird prescence he delivers. Jim Siedow, I have to say I prefer him in this movie compared to the first. 1) He has more dialouge, 2) His character has a name, 3) His character has a lot more meaning. And Bill Johnson, he delivered a great threatning role as Leatherface. Great job done. When I taped this film, they cut out all of the good scenes, you could even see where there were cut scenes, it missed out when Stretch was cornered by Leatherface and he pressed his chainsaw against her thigh, it missed where ChopTop, Leatherface and Drayton slaughtered a gang of yuppies in a parking lot, and where Leatherface slaughters Joe Bob Briggs.

The original Texas Chain Saw Massacre has always been one of my favorite horror films, and I was expecting this film to be a typical poorly made sequel. To my surprise, it was actually fairly entertaining. Although the beginning is slow, it quickly picks up, but doesn't seem to know where it is going, becoming more of a comedy than a horror. At times, the film is able to capture the emotion and intensity of the original. However, other times I was rolling my eyes at the stupidity of some of the scenes. Not to mention some scenes that were directly remade from the original. In the beginning, I thought Caroline Williams was a poor choice to play the main victim of the story, but she definitely proved me wrong, sometimes even reminding me of Sally from the original.

159,aaaa,God awful,1,3 July 2004,"This movie isn't funny, isn't amusing, and is simply painful to watch.  I only had some interest in it after reading some reviews here that claimed the movie wasn't as bad as some made it out to be, or that it didn't live up to the original, but held up on its own as a different take on the story. Well, rather than flesh out the strange details of the first movie, TTCM2 rewrites nearly everything, and the details that are brought back are simply repeated ad-nauseum.  Rather than an interesting, more detailed view of Leatherface's family, I found characters who were repetetive, annoying, and even boring at times.  The best part of this movie is the opening text, which treats itself seriously.  Then, immediately, we're warped into 1986, complete with goofy acting and ridiculous clothes.  The characters don't act, they just yell their lines at the top of their lungs.  And the incoherent Leatherface appearance at the beginning should have been enough warning that the entire movie would be this unwatchable.The movie isn't scary, but it does go out of its way to make you feel uncomfortable.  House of 1000 corpses is a far, far tamer movie, and is actually an enjoyable camp-fest compared to this drivel.  I thought the character chop-top would have some redeeming value, as one of his lines is sampled in a Primus song, and the actor that plays him seemed fairly proud of himself for playing the character in the House of 1000 corpses DVD interviews.  Instead, I find a character trying desperately to be funny and psychotic, and coming across as nothing more than stupid acting.  If you've seen Dumb and Dumberer or other comedies that try too damn hard to be funny, so hard that no sublety or believability is left, then you have every last character in this movie.The acting is intolerably dumb.  Every last scene is a gruelling test of endurance.  I don't care what drugs you're using, they won't get you through this film.  Your ears will bleed from hearing everyone shout their lines badly into the camera.  I can understand sub-par sequels.  i can tolerate bad movies.  But this is far worse than bad.  This is god awful.  It looks like it was directed by retarded sixth graders.  This does no justice to either the classic movie or the remake.  Why I listened to reviews on this site claiming it was at least tolerable, or simply misunderstood, I'll never know.  This movie is not enjoyable, and has no redeeming quality.  It adds nothing.  Not only is the acting bad, it's tainted with 80's style.  It does not age well.  There is no immersiveness here, only a film that tries too hard to be funny, scary, dramatic, action packed, and interesting, and fails on all counts.I would rather open the movie case and find it filled with vomit than watch this.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

161,poisontheewell,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen!,1,27 March 2003,"I went into this film with good intentions. Although the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was hokey and low budget it was a fine horror film and had good characters. The family was terrific. However, this movie was downright awful. I am still in awe of the badness of this film.First off, what happened to their house? Somehow they went from a little home in the middle of nowhere in Texas to some sort of underground death theme park. It didn't make any sense and it was stupid. Leatherface falls in love with the DJ or some small radio station and one of the family members has a METAL PLATE in his head. There were too many unintentional laughs in this movie to make it worth your while. At times it was downright awkward watching this movie.I think the script for this movie must have been about 3 pages long, because everything anyone said was just repeated a hundred times over and over again until I wanted to shoot the TV. In this movie the family isn't even exciting. They are annoying and pathetic and the one guy with the metal plate just laughs throughout the entire movie. It's awful. Everything about this movie it awful.The real kicker for me though was that in the first movie Leatherface was never reffered to as Leatherface, because his real name is Bubba, but his family in TCM 2 actually called him Leatherface. I couldn't handle it.Whatever you do, don't see this movie. It was just horrible. Worst thing I have ever seen.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
162,king_jack_the_wicked,More yummy than Drayton Sawyers award winning chili.,7,27 October 2003,"Doesn't it bother you when you read these reviews, both of fans and of ""pros"". An opinion is one thing, I have one, you have one - we all do... but what about the people who seem to take it too far, too serious. That was the case with this movie I do believe. People dogged it and killed it in reviews, it was a great horror movie, what were you expecting GONE WITH THE WIND?The first movie came out in 1974 introducing the world to Leatherface, chainsaw slaughter, hillbilly hobbies and the vision of Tobe hooper. None of which impressed me much, I did have a bit of a place in my heart for Bubba ""Leatherface"" Sawyer - still think he is one of the best things to happen to horror films. Tobe Hooper, however is not something I feel that's added much to horror, in fact Texas chainsaw and its impact WERE all that anyone felt from him. FUNHOUSE, INVADERS FROM MARS, LIFEFORCE were all dull and forgettable and POLTERGEIST was a perfect film, but it's so obvious that Spielburg directed that film just let Tobe hold the camera. I have watched almost every film of Tobe's in the last couple days with the exception of the 3 I don't have. I decided that I wanted to watch different directors; Raimi, Carpenter, Craven, P. Jackson, Romero, etc. and try to feel which one really spoke to me most - just as far as direction goes, not story or anything else, but enjoying everything about it as I watch.
TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 was one of the first movies I ever bought back in the very late eighties or early 90's. One of the first 10 movies I bought and now I have thousands - so maybe it holds a place in my heart for that fact, all I know is I like it alot.Tobe's direction is nothing amazing as I expected, but don't get me wrong he's not bad, just simply not unique. The story was not scary but not many films are. Gunnar admitted that when he played Leatherface in the first film that he based him on a mentally retarded person. Given a fact like that and seeing how his family were hillbilly lunatics it was hard to take it very seriously, so when I hear people complain about part two being more funny I have to argue that that was the only way to make it. If they had tried to make Leatherface really mean it would've been totally unbelieveable. His murder skills and madness were taught to him, he simply didn't know any better, so making him a killjoy slasher would've been wrong.
The cast of this movie was great. The guy with the metal plate in his head was wonderful - All you Primus fans out there might remember the song ""Jerry was a Race Car Driver"" from the SAILING THE SEAS OF CHEESE album in 1991 where a sample of Chop Top saying ""Dog will hunt"" can be heard. I am sad Gunnar Hansen didnt play Leatherface in it, but the guy who did wasn't so bad. Dennis Hopper in this movie is still somewhat of a shock to me, but he was great in it. The female dj ""Stretch"" is not a very familiar face, even though I have seen her in a few other horrors - is it just me or does she remind you of Laurie Metcalf (Jackie from ROSEANNE).Last but definatley not least the wonderful Jim Siedow (Drayton Sawyers), he was in the first Texas massacre also and just really has more depth than any one person from these movies. I can say I don't wan't to taste his chili though, made of only the finest human meat. Draytons encounter with Lefty (Hopper) will be one he, nor his ass will ever forget.The battlefields and radio station and even the bridge made for great settings. Fun to watch all the murder and chases and such go on there and if nothing else watch this movie to see people sword-like fighting with huge chainsaws - Thats Entertainment!With all that said and out of the way I will get back to my original point about this being a horror movie, a sequel at that, given an X rating for violence and it's a slasher movie - some of us like it, some like me, love them. When I go to buy a horror and it shows a guy holding a chainsaw on the box, I know what Im getting, I go home and I enjoy it - some are better than others, some downright SUCK! but I knew what I was getting and didnt expect it to be a life changing film.I am sick and tired of people dogging horror movies. It never stops....You know if it cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make and is directed by James Cameron that it's gonna be massive, you know if Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks is in it that it's gonna be massive, and you also know that when you get a movie like this what you are about to watch, so if you know you're going to hate it, then don't watch it and come here and put it down, unless youre a horror movie fan and have earned the right.FREDDY V/S JASON, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 and movies like that have lead the box office this year - so maybe critics, movie companies and everyone will see that horror is what the fans want and have always wanted. We've got to keep horror on top and maybe movie companies will start dishing out money for horror film makers and start promoting horror more, one can only hope.TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 - the kind of horror movie I like 7 out of ten stars",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
163,robertcrabtree3000,"I don't know about you, but I LOVED it!",9,24 April 2004,"I believe THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 is the best sequel in the""chainsaw"" series, needless to say it one of my favorite movies of all time. I think it is every bit as good as the original. It is the best sequel because it was directed by the Master of Macabre and Mayhem: Tobe Hooper, it also explainswhat happened to Sally Hardesty from the first after she escaped Leather-Face: when that guy in the pickup truck helped her get away from Leather-Face andhis saw, she was sent to the hospital. There, she told the doctors that she ""broke out of a window in hell,"" She babbled the most bizzare story anyone has everheard: A family of modern, cannibalistic hillbillies in an isolated farm house, chainsawed fingers and bones, chairs and funiture made out of humanskeletons, her brother and her friends captured and hacked for barbecue. After she told her terrifying tale, she sank into catatonia (she fainted from fear). So, the police launched a month-long man hunt. Despite a painstaking search, they could not locate the mad house. No crimes, no evidence, no bodies, no Leather- Face, no nothing.13 years later, a couple of fun-seeking teens are driving down Dallas, Texasand call a famed radio DJ so-named ""Stretch."" They continue to harras her over the phone until they are attacked on the road by a certain masked killer with a chainsaw, Leather-Face, good to see you again! Stretch records the screaminga buzzing of the saw and takes it to Lt. ""Lefty"" Enright. Lefty is the half brother of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, and when he heard about Sally and hernightmarish story, he made it a life mission to track down Leather-Face andcompany and kill them to obtain revenge (how dramatic). So, Stretch and Lefty team up. Lefty asks Stretch to broadcast the tape with the massacre on it onpublic radio so that the public (and of course, the police, who don't believe Lefty about his sister's ""Chainsaw Massacre""). Drayton Sawyer (the cook from theoriginal) hears this on his radio and sends his 2 cohorts, Leather-Face andChop Top (the hitchhiker's late brother) over to the radio station to kill Stretch. But when the killers get there, Leather-Face FALLS IN LOVE with Stretch anddecides NOT to slice her into pieces. I think this element is good, because it shows that Leather-Face has something that most other killers and slashers(like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers) do NOT have: EMOTIONS. Leather- Face may be a murderous idiot, but at least he knows what ""love"" is. He""molests"" her with his saw, try finding THAT in WEST SIDE STORY.When Leather-Face and Chop Top leave, Stretch follows them to their ""home.""Which is an underground layer beneath an amusment park (that's why thepolice couldn't find them). She also meets Lefty there, too. When Stretch falls through a trap door into the Sawyer's layer, Lefty breakes out some chainsaws of his own, he bought two small ones and one really big one much like Leather- Face's. So, the vengeful lawman enters the Sawyer's layer to rescue Stretch and of course, punish the Sawyer family for what they did to her sister!

164,Pupkin-2,Dodgy,5,15 October 1998,"The sequel to the texas chainsaw massacre is quite a disappointment, it's intentions are honourable enough in that it does not want to retread territory of the original.  Unfortunatetly this is the millstone that hangs around the film's neck = it tries to be so diffrent and diverse to the original that it just ends up a jumbled mess.Tobe Hooper cannot decide whether to direct the film as a straight out black comedy, a homage to the first or a pastiche of the first.   It is imaginative film making we see at work here however, it is incredibly flabby,  undiciplined,  self indulgent film making as well.

165,donmunk321,What was Hooper thinking? Why turn gold to dirt?,5,11 January 2013,"I am big fan of the original and the character Leatherface but this was just poorly done. The original was creepy and intense where as this sequel went a different approach, a tongue and cheek slasher...should have stayed with the original format, fair play they tried something different but to me that like wearing gloves on your feet. They had a good story with a bunch of creepy characters and just turned them into cartoon versions of themselves.Leatherface did not sit well with me at all. I love the character Leatherface but in this version he was very badly portrayed, would say the acting and directing are responsible. He just seemed like a caricature, almost like they was trying to hard to show you his slow mentality, too much lip licking and that stupid little chainsaw dance he done every time he was chasing someone. They should have tried a more subtle approach, rather than he keep doing the same thing throughout the film, yes we get the point he's retarded, we are not. Choptop was a horrible addition as well, he was annoying always repeating himself, chanting and again he seemed like a caricature, this time a badly done clone of the Hitchhiker from the original, I think they are suppose to be brothers but still does not make it acceptable to have a badly done version of the Hitch hiker repeating things that neither were funny or creepy, he was bugging the hell out of me. Even Drayton and Grandpa did not come off as creepy and well.Dennis Hopper was believable and not bad and so was the leading female. For a 80s slasher it's not bad, some good gore scenes, acting overall not too bad, except I was really disappointed by the villains portrayal in this movie, really spoilt it for me.The ending was pretty abrupt and seemed a bit unfinished.Not the worst but not the best either. If you are looking for a simple 80s slasher to give a watch this will do the job but if you are looking for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre experience you will more than likely be disappointed.

In difference from the cult first film which become by the ancestor of a genre and has generated numerous continuations and imitations, the sequel has turned out with a strong bias in «a black comedy» balancing on the verge of a trash. Well, where you still will see fight on Chainsawes between Leatherface and the sheriff? It is worthy of it, that it have looked! And an episode when the sheriff chooses to itself these most Chainsaw for forthcoming fight is simply hilarious. Though blood in a film like many, but rather bloody episodes of all, perhaps, two: in one scenes, one of members of a family a hammer has smashed a head to the employee of radio and an episode rip up a stomach Chainsaw. And this with the fact that I looked the full version of a film designated as «gruesome version». Nevertheless, the film has turned out in my opinion very quite good: It very dynamical, especially since an episode when Leatherface with brother to be declared on dismantling on radio station – from this point on in general begins a high-grade drive to the end of a film. Here I looked without coming off. It is necessary to tell about actor's works especially. Actor Dennis the Hopper which became popular enough actor in America after a cult film «Careless goer», all film goes with the most serious look, but thus, does amazing acts, and looks impressively. But the actress of Carolina Williams became a film star. Actually the most part of screen time is taken away to it, instead of Leatherface. By the way, the actress who at the moment of shootings was 29 years, looks it very not bad in all senses that is called, will handicap many young. She also plays pretty well, and very nice in itself. Though nudity with its participation in a film is not present, it is compensated to that the actress all film goes in super-short shorts and . In a film there is one episode when art of the director to create full erotic scene from anything, has proved to be in all beauty – in one of episodes of Leatherface gently drives switched off Chainsaw on the bared foot of Stretch, and then rested Chainsaw to it in pubis simulates sexual intercourse. Yes, it's worth seeing! to Make from Chainsaw phallus a symbol such it is necessary to think up! Tob Huper unequivocally talent. And victorious dance of Stretch with Chainsaw in hands in the film ending unequivocally makes impression original anthem of a bloody victory! It is a pity that Carolina Williams did not become the well-known actress though the data at it, in my opinion, all were. By the way, in the third part of a serial - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3, Carolina Williams has seemed in a tiny episode without words (will look the third part – pay attention on reporter at the very beginning of a film), probably to show communication between the second and third part of a serial.

I must assume this person accidentally switched the DVDs in his/her cases before he/she watched the movie.The first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a low-fi, gritty, dark horror film that left a lot up to the imagination and had a generally creepy vibe throughout.  The atmosphere was great--a family of murderous cannibals, who even make furniture out of the limbs and skeletons, and Leatherface wears masks made out of skin.  The hitchhiker gave a truly great performance with one of the snidest smiles I ever saw, and Marilyn Burns has the best scream I've ever heard.  Not a super-intelligent movie, no, but really atmospheric and dark.This movie is just pure cheese.  I am sure some of it was intentional (Chop Top was obviously inserted for comic relief, except I'm not sure what we're being 'relieved' from, since it wasn't scary), but I'm wondering how much wasn't.The film takes the gore up thirty notches, but most of it is cartoonish and stupid, proving more gore doesn't mean more thrills.  Gunnar Hansen is out as Leatherface and his replacement looks like he's trying to do the Funky Chicken while he plays with his chainsaw, and he seriously looks like Quasimodo.  Two kids making harassing phone calls to a radio station get sliced to pieces (or at least rubber cutouts of them do) while making the call, and the radio DJ Stretch plays it on the air, prompting a visit from Leathermodo and Chop Top.  Leatherface spares her, instead attempting to get her off with his turned-off chainsaw (I am not making this up, I swear). They kill her partner, who they later skin, and leave, and she follows them, where she lands in a body pit.The remainder of the film is lots of screaming, hollering, and yelling, and Dennis Hopper does his best Barney Phife impersonation, while Drayton Sawyer (the cook) seems to do a complete 180 from his character the previous movie (wasn't he the squeamish one when it came to killings?)I can't believe what a huge dropoff this is from the first movie.  some bits are so bad they're hilarious, but if I want to watch a 'so bad it's good' comedic horror film, I'll watch Evil Dead 2.

Kinda,5,30 June 2021,"It's hard not to have high expectations for a sequel to a classic like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" especially when the original director is back. But The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 has no intentions of being a true ""sequel"" or follow-up to the original film, opting for a darkly humorous and almost cartoonish direction.Whether you enjoy this film depends entirely on if you can get on board. The first scene, where Leatherface mows down a duo of obnoxious teens, had me hooked. But slowly, the film tests my patience with self-indulgent directing and acting that lingers far too on innane jokes and the pace suffers for it.That being said, both Dennis Hopper and Caroline Williams ground the films with performances that are both compelling and believable. Dennis Hopper even gets a chainsaw battle with Leatherface, a highlight of the film.So only watch if you have the highest tolerance for zany, off-the-wall humor mixed in with your exploitation flick.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

This idea was awful and I think that the movie it's a little overrated, even if is chronological perfect. 5,5 is a good rating but the movies is an awful sequel. Also I did't like that Leatherface and his brothers died at the end. And what happened to Stretch? Did she got crazy after the events of this movie.

The title is misleading, it has nothing to do with the first one except the main character, who, on a side note, plays more of a clown than a sick killer.
Nothing is put well together, although the first 20 minutes do give that feeling. After that time everything falls apart and the most hilarious thing about this movie is the sheriff, who's more of a psychopath than Bubba himself.

191,YakuzaElite1980,Let god have mercy on those who made this film!!!,4,28 December 2006,"For years I heard about this movie. Never fully bothered to rent it or pick it up I was always bitter considering that I was a huge fan of the original and the remake. And when I heard that it was to be released on DVD as an unrated version I was ecstatic. Well, to my amazement, the movie is a total let down. After all of these years of waiting what rests in my hand can fully be justified as garbage. Now, I do say that some of the film has high points, but the overall tone is just horrendous.First of all, Dennis Hopper's performance is terrible. His vengeance attitude is the laughing stock of this film. I can hardly believe or be pushed to accept that he is a man of revenge. To me he is nothing more than some jackass running around with a chainsaw. Nothing he does compels you to believe or feel pity for his character. The rest of the cast performance is on the level of cheese or way below it. Leather face, while being an eerie force in the first film with no remorse has been turned into a weak sissy. On top of that he makes absurd gestures with his chainsaw that will make you laugh and leave nothing to the imagination. The father character has gone from a controlling figure in the first film to downright foul mouthed. The corny acting tarnishes this movie so much, that you can barely hold yourself from laughing. The plot is none existence, the buildup is long and tedious, and the movie goes on such weird directions its hard to believe that this movie is a sequel to the first. Gone is the mystery and suspense, and raw tone. Instead we get nothing but almost two hours of why and how come.What a shame, I really thought that this movie was going to be good. I had such high hopes. The colorful and cheesy direction, bad characters, and a bastardization of a franchise to the a level unlike any truly make The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 one of the worst films ever.

I guess Tobe Hooper was trying to make the sequel as different from the first film as possible but it just ended up an insult to the genius of the original. First of all, the plot is pathetic and ridiculous. Hero ""Lefty"" asks for the help of a radio DJ ""Stretch"" (what's that about?) to help him put an end to the murderous family's rampage. Dennis Hopper is just embarrassing as Lefty and is completely miscast in the role, he is just not believable for one second, and the feeling that he doesn't really care is very clear. My main problem is with Leatherface, he is a completely different character and seems wimpy and pathetic. He is not scary in the slightest and spends too much of his time whimpering. The scene where he is getting aroused by Stretch and puts the chainsaw between her legs is one of the most cringe-worthy scenes I've ever seen. Everything that made the original TCM terrifying and disturbing is gone in this shabby sequel and the acting is awful. It's gory yes, very very gory, but that doesn't make it good. The only decent thing about this film is the opening scenes with the two guys in the car, which made me think it might actually be half good, but sadly I was very wrong indeed.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

It's unbelievable that this film was banned. Yes, you see a lair where body parts are hanging and that seems to be made from mud walls mixed with thousands of skulls, but it's more laughable than anything.The dialogue, what VERY little there is, is forced. There's virtually no conversation between characters, other than one crazy yelling at the others and most of the characters mumbling to themselves.The actual violence is virtually non-existent. You see a lot of chainsaws waving around, but there are few deaths.And the production values are just good enough to not be bad enough to really enjoy this for how terrible it is. (The one high point is the initial scene where the two boys are ""racing at 90 miles an hour"" across what is apparently the longest bridge in the world, while Leatherface, standing in the bed of the truck that is simultaneously BACKING UP next to them and staying beside them, is, from the appearance of the beans passing behind him, traveling at approximately 15 miles per hour.)If you're looking for any of the elements that make a horror film great, or so bad that it's really good, skip TCM2.

Cool.,9,3 December 2007,"Flying along on a highway 2 vehicles, a truck in reverse hauling ass and a couple of irritating drunk punks energized to the point of annoying .. until a chainsaw grinds through the steel to carve off the top of one punks head. His hands grasping the air at nothing,the blood squirting, the terror in his friend's eyes as he watches and their car crashes bringing an end to the blood-filled misery. I wonder if Stretch (the radio DJ)could really envision the sight that she had just heard. How long did the passenger lay there watching his life end.. In real life everyone involved would have sh*t their pants or had heart attacks. Pretty terrifying stuff. A man getting his head bashed in with a hammer by a deranged,cannibalistic Viet Nam Vet. And then his face peeled off while he's still alive and put on the face of the girl he adored. She wore his face (Dead Skin Mask) looking at him as he looked at her wearing his face .. How f*ing bizarre is this... A woman fleeing up flights of stairs and various platforms of an amusement park skeleton with a man chasing her slicing her legs and body with a straight razor. That sh*t really really hurt. As she reaches her limits and she chainsaws her pursuer (Chop-Top)and he falls down the spiralled abyss into nothingness. She screams in rage swinging the chainsaw bloodsoaked and terrified. The look on her face and the fear and terror and rage her eyes... imagine going through this .. Similar to the ending of TCM the original (though it was Leatherface)and the anger and the chainsaw buzzing in the air as it swings and the screen goes black and it's over. (Didn't hear/read anyone making this contrast). Some pretty sick stuff lol Stretch and her rage filled expression ,pushed past her emotional limits of survival ..

Cinematography, the dialog, the acting and the special fx are all done very well and helps create a very demented view of a particular families values. The absurdity of the film kicks in immediately as the two preppy dbags encounter Leatherface. The mask behind the mask was a neat touch to a great and surreal introduction scene of our antagonists.There are truly weird moments, Leatherface and his crush with the main heroine, chili cook off, Choptop at the station (creepy amazing scene), the old guy going nuts as Dennis Hopper tests out his new chainsaws. There are some very funny lines and not in a bad dialog way.Plenty of black humor and pokes fun of what the genre has become since he blazed the trail with the original Texas Chainsaw.I highly recommend this film to horror fans especially, that might be bored with the usual stuff.

There's something captivating about all that mayhem and outrageousness. Everything but the violence is played up for laughs particularly Bill Moesley's over the top portrayal of Chop-Top, Leatherface's brother. Speaking of, Leatherface's character has undergone a serious transformation from the sexually confused transvestite cannibal from the original to a sex crazed teenager embarrassed about his weirdo family and fixating on Caroline Williams's DJ heroine character. Tom Savini's make-up also deserves special mention as does the state of the art production design.

It's rare when you see a film so elaborate, constructed so rich with visual detail that you get a great sense of atmosphere (the underground setting), but also so terrible in ever other way to cause one to stop and ponder the extent to which films could be made bad all the while cognizant of the fact that it takes many ""professional"" individuals collectively to take on a project such as this. Basically I ask why? How?OK. Maybe it isn't THAT bad.  I remember renting this with 2 of my friends a couple of years ago.  Disbelief abounded.  That is the best way I can express laconically the reaction to the sequel to the cult classic TCM. Disbelief as to how the characters could be so corny, the dialogue so bad, the plot so incredibly paper thin.  In all honesty, it was so bad it was hilarious, and we have since, on many occasions, recalled some of the films's more memorable scenes such as the one in the beginning when a poor young college boy gets a generous portion of his head sliced off by ole Leatherface himself, despite the fact that he's behind the wheel of a speedy 4x4 and you would think that he would do whatever it took to prevent his brain from being hacked open like a ripe apple (like maybe ducking).  Also, the acting by the lead actress was decent.It was nice I guess to see Dennis Hopper in this film, but I would seriously question his sincerity if he told me personally that the TCM2 was just the dignity injection that his career needed.1 out of 10.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

203,mrdirector16,AWFUL!!!! Saturday Night Live does Texas Chainsaw (But THAT Might Have Been Okay),1,11 July 2020,"This has got to be one of the worst sequels EVER.I can hardly believe how TERRIBLE it is.
I would not be surprised if it came to be after writing two sentences on a napkin during a blackout drunk binge at the bar.
Every scene is crap, and every scene is stretched out to be at least twice as long as any good judgement should have allowed.Embarrassingly unfunny, shockingly inept in all departments. If the intention was to spoof itself, the execution, pacing and content derailed all potential for actual enjoyment from me.
Why go with slapstick attempts at comedy anyway when following up what so many find to be one of the great horror films ever made? I don't feel that way about the original, but I do suggest to horror fans that most any random unknown horror film pick would be more satisfying to you, or most any black comedy for that matter.The first one is competent and disturbing. This sequel is mind-dumbingly bad, and it's clear from the very first second, with the weak caricature acting and lack of any logic, and with road signs that look like grade school kids made them for a grade school play. If things like that were deliberate, which I'll go ahead and say that they were, that kind of humor never developed effectively or consistently, and if the ""it's spoofing itself"" nature (which this movie's defenders claim it has) was so brilliant, it would be full of those kinds of choices. But it's dull, stupid, slow, thin, and annoying.
I have no idea what Tobe Hooper was thinking, but it floats in movie purgatory, whatever genres it was trying to meld.
This, I suppose, is so bad that it has to be experienced to be believed, but that is no reason to waste your time.
Some of the worst acting and dialogue and attempts at comedy and/or horror I can remember ever watching.
Even Tom Savini's work is weak and lacks imagination and full believability.
Maybe about 3 minutes around 45 minutes in is okay, when Leatherface give his new ""mask"" to his new crush, and then the brief revelation right after he leaves. The only moment close to horror in the entire thing. Surely not enough to justify wasting your life. The final 20 minutes just repeats the first one in a new setting. Her screaming is completely terrible, and repeated like 50 times.
I guess the very last shot is kinda okay, but, again, why bother.
Avoid, or just watch to see how bad a movie can be. It's B.A.D!!!!!!!
The only saving grace is that Tobe Hooper made another film that came out the same year, ""Invaders from Mars"", which is bad in a different way, but a masterpiece compared to this hunk of junk. Truly ZERO or HALF A STAR. For the record, I really wanted to like this movie.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
204,mistergarret,TCM on crack *SPOILERS*,5,29 July 2004,"*SPOILERS*To better understand this film, I'll refer to other characters we know. So you know where I stand, I enjoyed TCM 74, give it a 7/10. It has its ups and downs. I haven't seen TCM3 or 4, but I think the 'remake', if you want to call it that, is one of the greatest horror films of all time.Basically, this film is the crackhead version of the original. I'll use and analogy I thought up while watching TCM2 to help you better understand it.Imagine two brothers, of about college age in the 70's, one somewhat intelligent, the other I see in my head as being like Brian from 'Half Baked.' Anyways, the intelligent brother writes 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and knows it has flaws, but still is a good amateur work. So he decides he will read the script to his brother one night, and see what he thinks. However, his brother is heavily intoxicated, and as the script is read to him, he's not absorbing very much of it. When brother 1 done reading, he asks his brother 2's opinion. Not remembering much, and being to embarrassed to say 'read it again', he just says 'that was good' and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is born. Assuming brother #2 still hasn't seen the movie, we'll jump 1986. Bored one night, while trippin' on acid, brother #2 decides he'll re-write what he remembers of his brother's story. He spends all night writing, and comes up with 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'.Now that you have the general idea, I'll break it down piece by piece. Tobe Hooper wrote and directed both films. He made TCM2 because he felt no one saw TCM for what he wanted it to be. It was supposed to be a comedy, but people found it scary rather than funny. So Hooper figured he'd show everyone what he was trying just so everything is properly expressed. Many of the scenes are reminiscent of the original, and the dinner scene is all but completely replicated. The characters have changed for the weirder. Chop Top is a crazier more perverted version of the hitchhiker. He's just the tag along, but still is interested by everything his two brothers do. Drayton is about the same, maybe a little more adventurous. Leatherface is however, very emotional, gets confused easier, is much more childish, and is surprisingly portrayed as the 'nice guy' out of the group. He actually helps the heroin escape.One thing that really stuck out is how this film is much more graphic than the original. It makes you realize how clean the original really is. Anybody who ever found it shocking, this film exploits how it was all in you head. You get out of the original what you put in, and that's probably why most people find the original boring. I was just surprised to hear the characters using profanity, seeing gore, hearing sexual innuendos, it didn't seem to fit the TCM atmosphere. The gore wasn't graphic, the language wasn't strong, and the sexuality wasn't to perverted, but it all stands out.In conclusion, I'd say I enjoyed the film, but most people wouldn't because it's the 'so stupid its cool' thing. I can compare it to Jack Frost, although I hated Jack Frost. The humor isn't that dull though, there's a little more substance to it. Some aspects don't line up with the original's story, as the hitchhiker is still alive, the home has been relocated, the MO's are different, etc, but if you can just chuckle and say 'whatever' you'll enjoy checking out this flick. Nothing special, but interesting.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
205,Bob_Balaban,Tobe Hooper's Masterpiece,10,27 May 2006,"In 1974, director Tobe Hooper and writer Kim Henkel set out to make a pitch black dark comedy entitled: ""Headcheese"". They intended the film to be PG rated comedy, but they ended up making what some see as the most horrifying film of all time which they retitled the more effective ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Now, while they did create a brilliant film which most now see as a classic, in their intentions, they did fail. Twelve years later, Hooper enlisted L.M. Kit Larson (Wim Wender's great ""Paris, Texas"") to write him a sequel to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" appropriately titled: ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". Larson's screenplay was witty, satirical, and much, much more violent than the original film, which contained much less violence than it is known for. To bring the gore Larson wrote in his screenplay to celluloid, Hooper teamed up with the wizard of gore himself, Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead, Maniac). Savini's gore looks great and at some points is truly gruesome, thanks to the great cinematography by Richard Kooris. Kooris' cinematography a bizarre yet beautiful feel the original did not have. The age make-up on the grandfather character is also considerably better than in the first film. The music as well, which in the first one was much more avant garde and ultimately bland, here is exciting and really fun.While Bill Johnson is certainly no Gunnar Hansen at playing Leatherface, this is made up for in the supporting roles, especially those by Bill Moseley (""The Devil's Rejects"") and Dennis Hopper (""Easy Rider"", ""Land of the Dead""). Hopper's character of an insane sheriff hunting down the Leatherface clan is great, but appears to have a much more complex layer to him than the other characters. All in all, the performances do add to the insanity of his brilliant film.

Literally, somewhere between when Dennis Hopper puts two miniature chainsaws in his holsters (that are evidentally made for miniature chainsaws), and when that stupid, pointless, retarded guy who scratches his head with a clothes hanger (WHYYYYYY) is throwing records around for no stupid reason, my friends and I just began staring blankly at each other...come to think of it, I don't even remember if we finished it. I could go on for days about how terrible this movie was, as well as how irritated I am knowing that at least 233 people in the world considered it to be a 10/10. I warn friends and people on the street never to watch this. I want to tell the entire world, but I can't. Now, who am I, and why should people care what I have to say? I don't know. I consider myself quite a well-broadened fan of movies. I have seen thousands, and I am going to school for film. This. Is, without a doubt. The worst. If you still insist on seeing it, then do so. But make sure you have no valuable objects lying around when you do, because you may end-up throwing them in a fit of rage. Terrible doesn't even describe this.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
208,timmyross,"Leatherface and the boys are back.....and this time, they're slaughtering for laughs!",5,22 October 2016,"As I reviewed before, the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is one of my favorite horror films of ALL TIME. It was gritty, raw, and realistic, and as I explained on that review, it seemed like it could have REALLY HAPPENED as many of the promotion of the film had marketed it as being a true story. Everything about the first TCM I love and there will NEVER be any complaints from me about anything in that film.I had not seen the first sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2, until I was about 18. The film was BANNED where I live and was not released until around 2006. Finally, I got to sit down and watch it when it played on late-night TV. Overall........I enjoyed it.The film takes place about a decade after the original. Lieutenant Enright (portrayed by the great Dennis Hopper) is a relative of Sally and Franklin Hardesty from the original film who has made it his life mission to find the killers and bring them to justice for murdering the invalid Franklin. After two young college kids are killed by Leatherface (this time played by Bill Johnson), Enright becomes convinced that they were murdered by the same killers, as the local radio DJ, Stretch (Caroline Williams) recorded their death cries, along with the sound of a roaring chainsaw, on her radio program. ""Lefty"", as Enright is nicknamed, then goes and arms himself up with numerous chainsaws in his quest to hunt the serial killers down in a bloody battle of revenge! Now, I can understand why many fans of the original did not take too kindly to TCM2. It completely diverts itself heavily away from the original film. The realistic documentary-like feel is lost, and instead, Tobe Hooper treats us to a black comedy of gory mayhem. When I first saw this movie, I must admit, I thought it was quite dumb. The terror and suspense that kept my interest piqued in the original was all but lost. However, it was then when I slowly began to realize......it was MEANT to be dumb. Tobe Hooper knew that he could never outdo the original TCM, so he tried something a little different this time around. The entire cast is new, except for the late Jim Siedow who reprises his role as Drayton/The Cook, who is the older brother of Leatherface and the gang. We also get to meet a new member of the serial killer clan in this film, Chop Top (Bill Moseley), who we discover was away fighting in Vietnam during the events of the previous film. The hitchhiker also has an appearance in this sequel, as a now decaying corpse his twisted twin brother carries around.At the end of the day, I still enjoy this film. Sure, it doesn't even come near the greatness of the original, but it is great in its own unique way. Thus, this would be the reason why it too has gathered its own cult following in recent years.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
209,brians-16549,I Guess Tobe Hooper Needed The Money.,5,11 October 2021,"Why else would he ruin a perfectly good horror movie ?The original was a classic, like Night of the Living Dead.This version is cheap and somewhat disappointing to those who wanted more of the original's greatness.I would say that there hasn't been a movie on the scale of the original Texas CM until Rob Zombie came out with The Devils Rejects, but even that did not come close to the mark.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
210,Lord_Gruul,One of the worst films I've ever seen,2,17 October 2019,"I felt like I was being insulted throughout most of this steaming pile of garbage. The thing to understand about this film is that it is a straight comedy. The problem is 90% of the jokes and gags are unfunny.I wanted to try to evaluate this on its own merits outside of the context of the first film. That's simply not possible. No one would have watched this turd if it wasn't for the first film. That being said, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 takes the creepy characters from the original and turns them into the three stooges.I cannot suspend my disbelief enough to believe for one second that these imbeciles have been able to build and maintain a barbecue business, let alone one that relies on capturing and butchering people without anyone finding out. The first film had a setting and characters that would have anyone weary of taking a trip to Nowhere, USA. This film features three morons performing slapstick routines in a cave that looks like they reused the set from the Goonies or an Indiana Jones film.Dennis Hopper's character is the only redeeming quality of this film. The scene in which he goes chainsaw shopping and the chainsaw duel are the two stand out scenes of the film. The opening scene works well also but after that the film runs out of gas and not even Dennis Hopper can keep the engine running.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
211,BastardOfDogs,Dennis Hopper hates wooden beams,3,27 June 2020,I give it three stars instead of one only because its only redeeming quality is Dennis Hopper spending half the run time angrily chainsawing wooden beams and dueling Leatherface in a chainsaw battle.,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
212,felipefigueiredodandrea,"believe It or Not, It's from Tobe Hooper.",1,14 September 2020,"I couldn't even believe It when I saw this movie was produced and directed by the original creator Tobe Hooper. That guy is a crazy cocaine addict motherf#&! that's for sure. The only good thing about the movie is that It plays 3 seconds worth of The Goo Goo Muck, by The Cramps. One of my favorite songs ever. How can anyone think this is the best of the Chainsaw-movies is just beyond me.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
213,tim-williams-6,Just finished watching this for the 1st time and.......,6,5 January 2008,"I have to say that I was fairly disappointed but not surprised. At first I couldn't see where Tobe Hooper was coming from. It took him 11 years to come up with a sequel and what he has made does not compare to the original, in the way of FEAR! No, he definitely played this for laughs and it shows, but tried to make up for it by employing Tom Savini to pile on the gore and Dennis Hopper for comedy value. Having said this I did enjoy it. The little nutcase with the coat hanger was suitably f**ked up (quite a good scene with him and the DJ when they first meet). Leatherface this time round was by no means scary! What really bugged me was his impression of a limbo dancer every time he'd smash through a wall or a door, close to his victim. This is a silly little sequel, but well worth watching. I read the review of this from the Radio Times which I usually find pretty good value. They view this film with very high regard  very odd. When you first start reading it it's as if your reading a review of Apocalypse Now or something. You think they must have got this wrong, but as you read on you realise that they are talking about the same film!",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
214,arvidstromberg,Nauseating- yes. Scary- no.,4,12 May 2003,"After the success of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a sequel was about as unexpected as the sun rising in the morning. Fair enough, sequels can bring some addition to a movie experience, even though most sequels (at least in my view) fail to live up to their originals. This is not one of the good sequels.In The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, we meet Dennis Hopper as the near-deranged and vengeful Texas Marshall, who uses a local radio DJ (Caroline Williams) to find the murderous family from the original film. If you call that a storyline, then sure. I call it nonsense.After watching this hack-and-slash-blood-spurting-everywhere feast, I felt quite sick to my stomach. I was however never the least bit scared. The movie is littered with gorey details I hesitate even to write about, and this initially has some shock effect. But after a while even that disappears. You -however horrible this may sound- become used to seeing people mutilated, covered in blood or eaten as supper every two seconds for the films duration to the point that it becomes boring. All that is left is a feeling of nausea, paired with the depressing thought that people actually spent time and effort making this movie.Qualities? Well... Dennis Hopper is in it. I guess that is about the only good thing I can think of, although you should NOT watch this movie hoping for a normal Hopper performance. He, like everything else in this film, is just pale and insignificant compared to the generous serving of blood and violence.As I recall, my first thought after having seen this movie was: ""This is the sickest thing I have ever seen"". I suppose that warrants some sort of recognition. I do not disapprove of movie violence, nor am I a stranger to watching horror films. I feel that violence and shock effects can be quite effective- after all, its better just to see it on screen rather than people experiencing it in real life. I have seen plenty of violent and brutal movies as well as more subtle horror in my day. But this movie has no justifications for its violence, other than that it somewhat takes your concentration off the bad acting and lack of story. To sum it up- you are better off not having seen this movie, and the only reason to see it is so that you can tell your fourteen-year-old friends that you have seen it. No-one else will be impressed- more likely depressed on your behalf.
I will however make a recommendation: if you are looking for something violent with a humorous twist paired with a healthy dose of self-distance, I heartily recommend Lord of the Rings-director Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"" (1992). It has most of the qualities this film lacks.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

216,YahiaShowgan,the worst movie i ever watched,1,27 August 2016,"The first ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movie was excellent, so we started watching this one expecting something great! the movie was awful. i didn't understand if it was supposed to be funny or scary, either way it did a bad job at both. it looked like a 10 dollar budget scary movie that was unsuccessful, i think it was meant to look like that, don't really get why. i recommend watching it so you appreciate all other movies much more. *SPOILERS**SPOILERS* let me give you some examples of how much the movie sucks: 1. there's a scene where leather-face tries to murder a woman and then ends up falling in love with her when she says are you good. 2. the place where the cannibal family keep all the meat is a never ending dungeon that is as big as a country. 3. someones face gets hit for a few minutes with a hammer and he manages to survive from that, gets his face removed and don't look like he experiences any kind of pain until he suddenly drops and dies. *SPOILERS**SPOILERS*",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
217,Slainmonkey,Misunderstood Masterpiece,10,23 July 2006,"I'm curtain that almost no one will doubt the the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre film is a horror classic, however the second has been a source of strong debate of if it was a worthy follow up or a massive disappointment. When if was first released it wasn't very well received for being released over a decade after the original not many people cared about seeing a sequel to it anymore and for those die hard fans who did felt put off because of how it took a very different approach then that the original did. The first was handled in a realistic and gritty manor, where as TCM 2 went for a very bizarre and surreal setting with a strong theme of dark comedy behind it like many other horror films of the mid 80's. However some regarded this as what killed the movies where as others feel it what made it great.I personally the that as one of the films strongest attributes. Despite having some similar scenes to the original the film had a completely different feel to it. This was good because it didn't feel like it was made just to live of the original like the Friday the 13th sequels, it was good entirely on it's own merits.While much of this film was based around dark humor it still managed to have moments that was actually scary. In this film they go into more depth into Leatherface's personality. It showed that he was capable of sympathy and other emotions and showed him as more human then what we got to see in the original and frankly made him a scarier character then what he was in the first and the film in general (particularly in the second half) had a very eerie atmoshere which even managed to last through the humorous scenes which make this the only film that managed to be scary and funny at the same time. However it was not as scary as the first.The other strenghts were that it was very quickly paced.....in the original the lead up scenes were boring...there is on question about that but even the lead up scenes often have some entertainment value and the second half of the film was literally non-stop. The other thing is that for an 80's horror sequel the acting was good and to top it off the special effects where done by king of splatter 'Tom Savini'. So there is a lot to like.If I liked this film more then the original is hard to say but he two films both the strengths in different ways and were both classics in my eyes. The first for being raw and powerful and this one for having a stronger story and faster pace. This is why Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a misunderstood horror classic that deserved better treatment then it received.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
218,ultraslainmonkey,Better then the first,10,3 December 2004,"I know many will disagree but I personally found that this film happens to be the best of the series. Now I was a huge fan of the first film but I must say that is very different styled sequel was even better. This films my not have quite have the intense atmosphere of the original but it as so many better qualities.1. The characters stood out from one another, unlike in the first where you only found out that Sally was the main character because she was the one who didn't die.2. The special effects in this film was amazing.....well it previous didn't really have many.3. The story comes together very neatly and one thing leads to another, in the first they only start getting kill because the stupidly walk into Leatherface's house.4. There actually is a plot this time.5. Leatherface was a better character in this one because it expresses how he is messed up, not in words but in Leatherface's actions, However in the first he is just a guy who wares the skinned fleah of others as a mask and chases people with a chainsaw.In many ways the 2 films shouldn't be to the first compared because the first is based on gritty realism when the second is a surreal tale that far stretches the realm of possibility and I find very bordering on being a fantasy tale rather then a slasher film. Due to that fact this film will make people either love it or hate it....I personally love it as you may have guessed and this happens to be my all time second favourite film (after Braindead aka Dead Alive). I recommend this filmhighly but take into account when you see it that there is a good chance it may not work for you.If you like this film I also recommend ""nothing but Trouble"" or ""House of 1000 Corpses"" however neither are as good.All in all I give this film 10/10!",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
219,s-aguiar,I can't believe it is from the same director!,3,14 January 2006,"A bad, bad sequel! Tobe Hooper was drunk when made this movie! The first TCM it's a masterpiece compared to this. Maybe those who like trash-bad movies would like this one. Penned by LM Kit Carson (director of Hopper documentary ""The American Dreamer"", and writer of 1984's ""Paris, Texas""), the film finds the inbred cannibalistic family of the original (though few of the original cast, including Gunnar Hansen, could be tempted to return) now residing in a cavernous underground lair, venturing above ground only for the odd slaughter. Hot on their heels is equally deranged former Texas Ranger Lieutenant Enright (Hopper), a relative of the youngsters long since butchered by Leatherface, Grandpa, and co. Enright finds an unlikely ally in plucky local disc jockey Stretch (Williams) whose suspicions that the local chilly contains prime meat of the long pig variety has the chainsaw wielding Leatherface (here played by Johnson) knocking on her door. Long since denied a certificate of any sort by the BBFC, appearing now in a director's cut version, this is the first time that the film has been released in the UK on any format. Gratuitously violent, and none too subtle (it lacks the subversive qualities of the original) it's also undeniably funny, maniacally energetic fare with a liberal smattering of enjoyable set-pieces. A committed post-comeback Hopper, whose career since the heady heights of ""Apocalypse Now"" had re-reached a state of permanent flux, is a hoot. However, admirers of the first film may be in for a disappointment.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

First of all, let me say i am a HUGE horror movie/TV show fan. I have seen many horror movies and most of them from 1990-2014,some are really good, but most use shitty CGI and all that, which can get boring, and annoying at how bad they do it. This film uses none of that. Yes, it might have been the early years for CGI, but they don't use it. They use makeup and props. As i said before, i remember this film being good, a 7 out of 10, but know coming back to it, a 10 defiantly. I wish they had this on DVD in JB-HI-FI or something like that. I can say that this is my favorite horror movie out there! I would pay $60 dollars just to get this on DVD. Hopefully i find this somewhere to get.

While the original was gory, over the top, and sometimes chilling, TCM2 is in a whole different category of films.  Hooper does an incredible job poking fun at himself and his original ""horror masterpiece"".  TCM2 is black, morbid horror that will appeal to those that can appreciate movies like ""Re-Animator"", ""Dead Alive"", ""Army of Darkness"" in spite of their gruesome elements.While some scenes are genuinely creepy and may give you cause to check your closet before going to sleep afterwards, for the most part the movie plays more to those that find oddball cannibals and serial killers funny in a twisted sort of way.In it for the gore: skip this one and check out the original.Can laugh morbidly at a sociopathic guy who scratches his exposed metal plate with a coat hanger and eats the little bits of scalp that comes loose: rent this one and enjoy.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Overall this movie is good in its own way because it is not trying to be as good or better than the original its kind of a spoof or satire of the original and thats what makes it unique and stand out and there is no point in comparing this to the original because they are both totally different movies but still share the same characters in my opinion it is a good movie in a strange way because it shows that a ton of effort was put in by the actors and behind the scenes because all the characters are believable and the sets and lighting in this movie gives it its own kind of style so i would recommend this movie to people who like dark humour and are fans of the franchise.,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
