0,SAMTHEBESTEST,Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami rocks but the movie Sucks because of non-cinematic & unconventional life of Jayalalithaa.,5,11 September 2021,"Thalaivii (2021) :
Movie Review -While looking at any biopic, i always seek for inspiring tales and socially-challenging characters. To be frank, a star's life or any politician's struggle is not what i find fit for it. Instead, i would love to know the story of an underdog who has done tremendous work in his life or someone whom i can call legend in that field. Jayalalithaa's life can be viewed in two parts, one is her film career and second is her political career. In Thalaivii, the writers have tried their best to trim it and settle down for 150 minutes or so, but have failed considerably to understand the cinematic perspectives of the story. Her pre-political life looks so cold, dry and soulless and that unconventional affair/love story with MGR never found any ethical meaning. Thalaivii will take you into a boredom in the first half but fortunately the second half is powerful so, it becomes an Average Watch overall.The film is about Actress and Politician Jayalalithaa and her career, love, struggle, fights and almost everything any masala script can promise. Actually, the problem appears in the unconventional life of her by the time it starts looking conventional, it's too late. The first is about her film career, her bonding with her mother and her love affair with Superstar MGR who is already married twice. I don't see how that makes too much sense to showcase unethical character like this with so much of proud? Let her political career be the reason to be proudly presented. And that foeship with RM Veerappan was damn too outdated. The same script could have been crafted better and then i might have felt the greatness of her character. However, i had feelings for her in the second half and even though it was lot more dramatic than needed, i still quite had tears at couple of occasions.Kangana Ranaut as Jayalalithaa an actress is not that good but as a Politician, she has nailed it. Those early days of her career didn't have much varities so i can't blame Kangana for looking Kangana only on screen. Later, in the second half Kangana gets those varities and blossoms like a matured actress. Arvind Swami as MGR looks like MGR, especially with that white Cap and Black Goggle. His accent sounded little dull here and there but otherwise he is fantastic. Raj Arjun plays RMV and what an amazing act he present. Though, his character sucks big time, he as actor never looked out of it. The supporting cast is okay, nothing too great nor too bad.Thalaivii is stretched by the songs which were necessary for the commercial purpose but doesn't really leave an impact. That Bharatnatyam song was grand and lavish but the audio sounded underwhelming. Dialogues are fine, sometimes dramatic but mass oriented where one can clap and scream. The screenplay is terribly slow in the first half but better in the second half. Vijay's attempt to glorify Jayalalithaa's life on screen might please her die hard fans but for neutral audience and classes, this story has got nothing much interesting. Those people can watch it only and only for Kangana and Arvind's performance, rest strictly Average.RATING - 5/10*",Thalaivi
1,Fella_shibby,"Boring movie with abysmal editing, awful cinematography n appalling acting. Aditya Pancholi rings a bell? Rofl.",1,31 October 2021,The lead actress is an epitome of overacting.The lead actor looks like a boiled potato.So many genuine negative reviews posted by prolific reviewers got deleted n so many fake positive reviews posted by paid trolls (check their profile history) are flooding this site.53 times my reviews of this pathetic movie got deleted by paid trolls and i am loving it cos my reviews are givin em sleepless nites.,Thalaivi

4,nadkarnisumeet,Kangana's Thalaivii is worth a watch.,8,26 September 2021,"Thalaivii review :After Bellbottom last week, here's another theatrical release coming to OTT in just two weeks. I guess no one is willing to risk the theatres yet so this kind of hybrid format will continue for sometime.As for Thalaivii, it is a well executed biopic on the heroine turned Chief Minister Jayalalitha tracing her incredible journey from a novice to a winner. Its way ahead of the web-series Queen released on MX Player last year.Kangana Ranaut playing the titular role, delivers yet another knockout performance. The Roja (1992) pair - Arvind Swami and Madhoo - play Mr and Mrs. MGR. Arvind is truly the surprise package of the film and his resemblance to the real MGR lends a realistic touch to the pivotal character. The movie sequences between him and Kangana are sure to generate nostalgia amongst the MGR- Jaya fans. Nasser is impressive as ever playing MGR's friend turned foe Karunanidhi.Finally, Thalaivii is worth your time and money. It has splendid performances and an inspiring story to tell...Dont miss!!P. S. After watching Thalaivii, I would recommend Mani Ratnam's Iruvar (1997) to those who haven't seen it yet. It will complete the Jaya saga perfectly.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Thalaivi
5,katyayan-12892,Decent Movie,6,9 October 2021,"Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told.",Thalaivi
6,tushargupta-27286,Politics drama,5,26 September 2021,This movie is totally awesome and nice .Kangana Ranaut acting is totally awesome or amazing.,Thalaivi
7,sriramthestranger,Good drama!!,8,12 September 2021,The fictional biopic goes on the theme of 'women empowerment' and has delivered it quite convincingly. The casting is too good and everyone has given their best performance. The interactions between J and Samuthrakani take the scenes to next level. Dialogues from Karky esp. For Karuna's character is just brilliant. Good entertaining film adaptation!!,Thalaivi
8,MandalBros-5,Very STRONG. Kangana 💥,9,9 October 2021,"Thalaivii began with the strongest dialogue of the trailer. The rest of the film continued on the same form, it didn't become slow for one bit. The movie was full of brilliant moments and the performances enhanced this moments even more. The background music shined in every moment.Both the lead specially Kangana amazed us again with her strong portrayal of Jayalalithaa. She was perfect for this role. I think Kangana will win her 5th National Award with this in the next year. In the supporting cast I loved Raj Arjun. Dialogues were another strongest point of this film. Finally, the movie is very strong, emotional & also inspirational.Available on Netflix (Hindi).© MandalBros.",Thalaivi

11,rahul000994,Kangana Ranaut & Arvind Swamy Pay A Resounding Ode To Jaya-MGR's Poignant Love Story !!!,7,29 September 2021,"An iconic figure in Indian politics, Jayalalithaa's political journey is known to most. Director Vijay attempts to unravel her icy cold persona and look at her as a woman passionately driven by love. Make no mistake, a woman's fight for self respect and battle against patriarchy are integral to the story. However, what lies at the heart of the tale is her unconditional love for MGR, despite the societal contempt of her. She faced the wrath of his loyal followers, who deemed their extra marital relationship as illicit and a disgrace to his noble reputation. As days turned into decades, they became each other's strength and weakness. Bound by the heart, the purity of their love stayed intact even as murky politics, power struggle and people got hellbent on parting the two. The scenes where they indulge in phone conversations without uttering a single word but letting their silence do the talking are heartbreaking. The film essentially works for its poignant love story.Perceived as the 'other woman' in MGR's life, who got things easy for being his blue eyed girl, Jaya had everything but respect at the beginning of her political career. Despite being cornered and humiliated time and again, she marches on with her head held high. Her relentless fight to earn her place in the society forms the crux of the film.Kangana in the titular role channels her inner rebel and unflinching self assurance to make a point - she plays second fiddle to no one. A classic case of her screen character imitating her real life in a way. She renders a powerful portrayal of a lovelorn woman who keeps rising like a phoenix from the ashes. She elevates the formulaic script with quiet determination and powerful presence, cleverly not mimicking Jaya but getting the tone and nuances of her character right. As a woman scorned by people for loving fearlessly and feeling deeply, Kangana is outstanding.The actress finds a perfect companion in Arvind Swami as MGR, her mentor, the wind beneath her wings. He brings in a certain calm to the storm that engulfs Jaya. Swami is impeccable in his mannerisms and body language. There couldn't have been a better actor to play the Tamil screen icon and people's leader.Dialogues are painstakingly written and hit the right note. ""Mahabharat ka dusra naam jaya hai"" sums up Jaya's life perfectly. In a scene where Jaya tells her ailing mother that people only remember you when they need you, her mother righty argues, ""Bina Matlab ke log bhagwaan ko bhi yaad nahi karte."" When Jaya is told that everyone reveres MGR and that she is no different, she says, ""Krishna ko sab pasand karte the, phir bhi Radha ki sab mein ginti nahi hoti."" Neeta Lulla's costumes are detailed and effective. From conical bras of the 60s and 70s to the winged eye makeup, bouffant and vintage props, the recreation of a bygone era is decent if not specific.Thailaivii pays a resounding ode to Jaya-MGR's poignant love story, a relationship without labels. The political aspect feels talky, half baked and one-sided. What eventually stays with you is the story of a woman who defied the odds and wrote her own destiny.",Thalaivi
12,maanikroda,Kangana Ranuat will definitely get 5th National Award for Thalavi!,10,2 October 2021,"Smt. J. Jayaylaitha popularly know as AMMA will be so proud of everyone who made this film possible.Shardhanjali first of all.Second, why this movie got low rating just 6/10, isn't just a about Kangana Ranuat's haters but Amma haters also.I wrote in the beginning that she was honoured with AMMA title. Amma is widely know in North India as Mother or Ma or Muma. She was that. She had a grip that was unending.Till now I think something related to my work life, whenever I'm in a dilemma, I do remember her.Coming back to this movie which apparently number 1 in Netflix is in itself vouch that people do appreciate AMMA and the character of Kangana Ranuat.Coming to the movie, I didn't think for just a fraction that the one performing the role was Ms. Ranuat. She did perform the role as AMMA. I was really in sync with her acting and her putting weight was the highlight for me. MGR, Karunanidhi and Ganesan did good job.If you check my history, I normally don't give any movie 10 ratings but this film is something different.",Thalaivi
13,madanmarwah,Kangana plays Jayalalitha well in this biopic,6,25 October 2021,"This movie can be best described as a political biography and is therefore different from a conventional film in the sense there is no villain, no comedian, no vamp etc etc. Those having an interest in politics of South India and having knowledge of the political and personal lives of Jayalalitha and MGR may like this movie. ( In the movie MGR is made MJR and DMK is made TMK). Also they are best qualified to comment whether the movie does justice to personalities of the characters or to the events depicted. Since I do not belong to this category, I can only evaluate how well the film is made from the script available.The movie has a slow narrative with few exciting moments in between as it unravels the events as they took place. There are the usual games of dirty politics and the changing power equations. Two scenes stand out. One where Jayalalitha is man handled and molested in the assembly and second at MGR's funeral where she is not allowed inside.The movie provides a great opportunity for Kangana Ranaut to showcase her talent as she essays the role of a brave lady who by sheer ambition and grit rises from a film actress to the level of the state chief minister. All this as she braves all odds to make a prominent place for herself in the male dominated political field. She is humiliated in the assembly, vows vengeance, fights for her self respect and faces the anger of MGR's followers due to her extra marital affair with him. Arvind Swamy as MGR has also played his character well and the make up has helped him considerably. Their love for each other has been shown nicely with some delicately presented scenes.The movie may be found heavy and lacking in entertainment by some audiences due the nature of the storyline and the absence of conventional box office trappings.",Thalaivi
14,sanjubhat,Great cast .. awesome direction .. strong content!!,8,27 September 2021,"#sanjuzzreviews
The film depicting the transition of an actress into one of the most powerful politicians in India has been portrayed very well. How she breaks the into the male dominated political arena and beats them at their own game is what makes the film entertaining to watch.Kangana steals the show as her portrayal of Jaya. Arvind Swamy is back with a bang with his restrained performance as MGR & Naseer stands strong in his portrayal of Karuna, the strong and wily opponent of Jaya and MGR.Madhu, Bhagyashree & the others lend valuable support to the lead cast. Direction by Vijay too is worth a mention.Special care has been taken not to hurt feelings of the powerful politicians who play central characters in the film.An out and out woman oriented film with strong content, great ensemble cast and direction. With a runtime of 2 hr 10 mins Thalaivii is definitely worth a watch.Pls go with an open mind without going through too many negative reviews and you will enjoy the movie. Adios 🙂",Thalaivi
15,rajnot,How to screw up a good plot in 2 hrs,2,30 September 2021,"Wow, worst movie been made on Jayalalitha. Kangana sure knows how to screw up acting in her own style. Zero emotions and stupid acting and thin plot.Even one can skip it in OTT. No wonder, why it was quickly released on OTT.Skip it and save your time.",Thalaivi
16,sumanth-05484,Nice One,8,11 October 2021,Nice acting by Kangana Ranaut and Aravind swamy . One time Watchable.,Thalaivi
17,shvmbanerjee,Not an Autobiography.,5,17 October 2021,"Lesser of a biography, and more on the love life of Jayalalitha. For a movie on a Chief Minister, and an influential figure, you should have utilized the time and have added crucial things in between. At best, it classifies as a romantic movie.",Thalaivi
18,navendu_krishnan,Thalaivi - A good movie,8,11 September 2021,"Thalaivi - A good movieWhat I loved : Casting & Acting of Kangana, Casting of Aravind Swami, Nassar
AL Vijay's unexpected good direction
Dramatic scenes made enjoyable without lag
StoryWhat I hated : Aravind Swami's acting, Shivaji Ganeshan's casting with an unknown guy (eventhough he appears only for a minute, that was a totally nasty casting)
Songs were below averageOverall felt good, plus after watching a movie in theatre after a decade !",Thalaivi
19,Sidney101,Truly captivating,10,10 October 2021,This movie was totally captivating from start to finish the level didn't drop. There was only one known star in the film for me everyone else was unknown to me yet I was gripped all the way. Truly amazing performance from Kangana I was in awe of her performance. She really is a remarkable actress.,Thalaivi
20,cooldwijen,What is wrong with all the haters,9,7 October 2021,It is a solid 8 star movie. One extra to counter balance the haters. It is a gripping tale of Jaya amma acted so well by Kangana. Leave your bias aside and watch it. You won't be disappointed.,Thalaivi
21,srd-30659,A great disappointment,6,26 September 2021,"It is rather Kangana, not Thalaivi. She is unable to come out of her screen.Comparison with web series Queen is inevitable. The drama is missing here. Script is patchy. Sound is mainly a shriek.Queen cleverly restricts the film life part, Thalaiva merrily celebrates those Bollywoodish dances around the trees.All in all huge disappointment from Kangana who is otherwise good actor.",Thalaivi
22,ashishbgm,Movie is Horse S**t,4,1 October 2021,"Four stars for MGR character. Either make it filmy or bring realistic touch or don't make these kind of movie. Trying to appease everyone, they have made her fairy god. To be frank, she was responsible for breaking the alliance with BJP and made Atalji lose the prime minister position. Don't show her all sweet character, she was fierce and foxy sometimes. But definitely she was responsible for bringing many motor companies to Chennai and making it known as Detroit of India. Kudos to the development she made.",Thalaivi
23,rosheenkan,Entertaining and Fantastic Potrayal,10,10 September 2021,"Kangana potrayal as Jayalalitha is awesome and win our hearts. Not only that, thanks to Karky and Vijayendra Prasad screenplay and Vijay direction, the film is watchable and her career best act. Defintely it is a must watch. Don't miss it.",Thalaivi
24,sanjeevanwar,Expected a better biopic,5,27 September 2021,"Anwar Says: Ammu to Amma and her regular tussle with male counterparts consumed three- fourth of the screen time. It was certainly difficult to show Jaya's 20 years journey in 155 minutes, but director Vijay ended up translating this biopic into a hush- hush movie.A movie made by convenience, it started where he wants and ends where he desires. The inner conflict or strength of these giants in Indian Politics have hardly been shown. Some of the sequences have been so exaggerated and dramatically told that audience feel uncomfortable, particularly the throwing out of Jaya out of Vidhan Sabha .Kangana Ranaut was the right choice for the role and she tried to live with the character but lack of lips sync is apparently visible except when she speaks English. Arvind swamy also tried harder to copy the mannerisms of MJR but in vain. The worst hit is Karunanidhi, played by veteran Naseer .Overall Thalavi was unable to reflect the original state of Tamil Politics and the cult figures Jayalalitha, MJR and Karunanidhi. I would have loved to see the much talked about Jaya's wardrobe, her shoes collection and her controversial relationship with Shashikala .#netflix

26,shaeshatriashwin,Thalaivi The Iron Lady,10,10 September 2021,Review: Itz an honourable Biopic of Indian IronLady. A very heart warming PanIndia Movie this Year. What an acting by Kangana actually she lived in this movie. Arvind Swamy magic and Screenplay visual are so realistic. Full marks for story and Direction. Really a Must watch Film only in theatre.Verdict : Blockbuster in Tamil & Hindi (PanIndiaFilm),Thalaivi
27,coolhunk55,Overacting shop. Left midway!,3,12 October 2021,The movie doesn't create any impact while watching and that's why had to leave it halfway. Kangana is a good actress but all she has done in this role is give some gyan and overact. The other thing which her character portrays is that she is just using others for her benefits. I don't think that's how Jayalalithaa was. She was a strong figure. Kangana definitely doesn't fit in her shoes.,Thalaivi
28,premsinghps-18289,The Best tribute to Jaylalita,10,10 September 2021,"If you really want to see, how a biopic should be.. this is the best example.. Kangana portrayed of Jaylalita is outstanding.. Arvind swami did justice to his role.. supporting casts are also in thier best.. highly recommended..",Thalaivi
29,nickraman-27699,Thalaivii : Kangana hits the ground running from start to finish,8,30 September 2021,"Note: This is NOT a dubbed film. This is a bilingual shot in 2 languages, Hindi and Tamil & dubbed in Telugu.What does that mean? It means the talkie portions are show twice in each language. Thalaivii however has portions retained in Tamil (mostly the recreation of MGR/Jayalalitha scenes), but if you've seen Nadigaiyaar Thilagam (Tamil dubbed version of Mahanati (Telugu), it plays exactly the same way where Savitri scenes are recreated from Telugu, despite being dubbed in Tamil.)Another stroke of genius is the screenplay by Mr. Vijayendra Prasad. This man needs no introduction from penning films for his son, SS Rajamouli (Bahubali series, the upcoming RRR and others) as well as the last decent Salman Khan film I enjoyed, Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Prasad's story of Jaya's rise from Cinema se CM tak (as the film suggests) plants masala-like moments in the screenplay that really illustrates Jaya's change and persona growth.Right from the 60s era of cinema, note the moments where Jaya says Namaste to everyone besides MJR (Arvind Swami, in what is another master stroke of casting) in the name of respect up until the final scenes of the film. Brilliant book-end! There are other great moments sprinkled throughout the film and I don't want to play spoil sport in this review to list them out.This is one of the most ""pan-india"" friendly bio pics I've come across and it's not that easy to transcribe or adapt the culture of Jaya, Tamil cinema and Tamil politics for the Hindi audiences. For many of the Tamilians, the stories seen in the film may be of redundance, but for those unaware of Jaya, this is a great chance to experience that culture without going into ""self-indulgence rabbit hole"" zone.This is Kangana's best till date (yes, even better than Manikarnika.) She sinks her teeth into the persona of Jayalalitha and lives through it. Wouldn't be surprised if she garners another National Award win because she deserves it. Next is Arvind Swami, an excellent portrayal of MJR if not better. Nasser (as Karunanaidhi) is simply superb. Credit given due to most of the supporting tamil artists who have given their best in their Hindi lip sync despite being voiced over by a different artist.I don't understand the low ratings for the film (whether they are attributed to Kangana's politics or the hatred), but I would set that aside and watch off the film. As Vijayendra Prasad said, he couldn't imagine anyone else doing it besides Kangana and I couldn't agree with him more.",Thalaivi

Mostly concentrated on the love story between MGR and Jaylalitha. Kangana did ok. She didn't do anything speciaI. I only liked the perolformance of Arvind Swami. He didn't tried to do any show off. He remain calm. And performed brilliantly. Movie tried to show how Indian make politicians God. And this probably the reason why our country is in such a bad state.

48,singhnisha-00494,Worth a watch,9,18 October 2021,Fantastic acting by Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami. Just a simple depiction of a tough lady's life. Very sensitively dealt without dramatic over the top drama/story or acting.,Thalaivi
49,indrajitbagal-83079,Watch for Arvind Swamy's MG Ramachandra performance ! Superb acting !,8,12 September 2021,"Lead actress's performance was ok but I think the real plus point of this film is MG Ramchandra's character played Arvind swamy. His screen presence, acting and dialogues made the film watchable.Editing was the worst part of film, scenes were cut abruptly. Direction and screenplay was average. Songs were below average.",Thalaivi

54,gee-s,Fascinating!,9,10 October 2021,"When the trailer was out, I only gave it a cursory watch and forgot all about it. Also happened to see some reviews that sort of wrote this movie off. Though I also noted that these were the same reviewers who went out of their way to send praises to Farhan Akhtar for Toofaan even when putting down that movie.What started off as a time pass watch of a new movie on Netflix quickly demanded attention. This was the story of a woman the nation knew yet did not know. Admittedly there is more to the life of the fascinating Ms. Jayalalithaa. A lot more than what can be covered even in 3 hrs of movie time. She was someone who commanded equal attention in her achievements as well as her controversies.I have not been a fan of Kangana Ranaut's tendency to land herself smack into the midst of one controversy after another but it was hard to discount or dismiss her acting as she effortlessly moved from one scene to the next. She has come a long long way from when she started in the movies.With an acting powerhouse like Arvind Swami essaying the role of MGR, it was an easy duet. The key supporting cast in the likes of Raj Arun and Bhagyashree did justice to their roles while other close confidantes like Sasikala were not key to this narrative.The movie did devote a good amount of time to the time before Jayalalithaa found her way into politics and while that was relevant to her growth and personality, it cost length and time and could have done with more edits.I did not spend a whole lot of time reading the reviews in here but personally enjoyed this movie and the ending only made me want for more. That is pretty telling for a movie that was 2hrs33mins long.",Thalaivi

Infact the most downgrading has come from Tamil viewers of the film..including me..who likes to watch a movie in its original language...and hell no kangana FAILED MISERABLY in speaking Tamil.. she couldn't even move lips properly... AMMA deserved better... I don't know what the director and production house were snorting but if they were just banking upon vicious, venomous viewer bank of kangana , then they calculated it wrong... Most of the people despite their political leanings go to watch cinema of all kinds...and they search for good acting , direction in the movie...but this movie had none... kangana can act ..no doubt about it..but with her over-confidence she overract all the time...and its not biographical in any sense...most scenes as I say are presumptous...far from reality. Yes Bollywood is bad..but kangana, an actress , is no alternate to Kareena or Deepika or Bhumi. Yes Bollywood is bad..but Kangana, a kinda director, is no alternative to KJo, Anurag basu or Kashyap.

This is my first south Indian movie, it is so refreshing, I doubt if I'll ever watch bollywood again. The script is tight and well woven, actors have performed very lifelike, Kangana floors the viewers with her mind blowing performance. Arvind Swamy does his part of aging actor cum politician so life like and amazing. Others such as Bhagyashree and Madhu had small parts but did full justice to their parts. Stunning movie, it stays in the mind long after it is over. Must watch for the performances and story, and Jayalalitha's life story is intriguing. Ending was top notch.",Thalaivi
77,bothambhai,Absolutely rubbish movie,1,2 October 2021,"A totally disengaging, garbage movie. Pathetic acting, I think Kangana needs to quit while she is ahead and join politics full time. She has lost her entire craft, which is surprising. Her last few movies although they have flopped she at least tried to act, the problem is lately I see, she has resorted to cliched acting.Do not believe in all these paid for max ratings, this movie is not worth wasting your time.

I watched this movie until they show MGR coming to the studio... Please Ms. JJ was not that arrogant and she was just landing her feet in movies and anyone and everyone knows MGR was bigger than a hero and everyone wanted to act with him, that includes Ms. JJ. And here in this movie they show as if her ass is stuck to the chair and don't respect the legend. That totally put me off, not only me even my little girls said ""dad let's change the movie, it's showing crap"".Please be realistic and not portrait the actor but the Person who you are trying to portrait. Even in that first scene, she was unnecessary shouting or mimicking like she is getting hurt please that was one bad acting. My kids act better. I was disappointed that I am not able to see Arivand Swamy, Mr. Nassar and Mr. Samudrakani just because of the main actors stupid acting, maybe later on she might have acted better but if a book start is not good we tend to not complete it, that's how movies too if the start (acting) is not perfect then we tend to watch worse movies with better acting.",Thalaivi

94,ar-reviews,An ad film to launch Kankana into politics,1,10 October 2021,"Aravind Swamy as MGR was great. That's it, tgat was the only good thing about the movie.The movie like Manikarnika is an attempt to launch Kankana into her political career. The first half talks about Jayalalitha's life as an actress and her affair with MGR. Since this doesn't do much for Kankana's political career, it is executed as a chore and is extremely boring to watch. The second half where she becomes Thalaivi you can see a little more heart in the effort. But the propaganda of the lead actress is so evident I could not look past it into the movie.Lastly, Jaya was a great leader but she was corrupted too, I grew up watching news of the raid of her house where luxury goods were stashed. We have a duty to the nation and next generation to be truthful in political biopics so that yesterday's mistakes are not repeated. It's irresponsible of Amazon and Netflix to air a movie filled with propaganda.",Thalaivi

99,write-to-balaji,Watch it for MJR,6,10 September 2021,"Went with anticipation of watching the legendary performance of Kangna in the role of one the Politician who I admired greatly.As in all Female centric movies, the expectation from Arvind Swamy was a second fiddle role, with no much scope of performance.But the movie surprised me by delivering the exactly opposite goods.Scene after scene Arvind Swamy delivers delightful performance, not once did it look like a parody.Even Jaya's character looked convincing in the earlier part of the movie where her character is being developed, but it fails to hold and build the intensity till the end to culminate into a dominant & larger than life persona that the Ex-CM of Tamilnadu was.Its an irony that in a biopic of Dr. Jaya who rose to power breaking the shackles of Patriarchical dominance, the male protogonist effortlessly manages to do dominate the proceedings. The Title should have been Thalaivaa instead (on a lighter note).The blame should only go to the writers for not giving any depth to the title role, where Kanagna could unleash her prowess.Also, the dialogue delivery (in original Tamil version) seems superficial and lip sync is very unconvincing. When your eyes and other facial muscles doesn't speak the same language as your lips then you get something like this. Kudos to her for trying her best, she should stick to Hindi where she can deliver the punch in such roles.",Thalaivi
100,nitishpuri-ce-89,One of the best movie from Kangana,10,28 September 2021,Hats off to the cast and crew of Thalaivi. You guys have made a marvel. Kangana again stole our hearts away.

I never understand why production houses constantly miscast when it comes to biopics. Kangana Ranaut is a decent actor but totally out of her element here. It's a disaster from the word go. Please, please use the right actors for the right roles.",Thalaivi
107,tapanmozumdar,"Old wine, one bottle",5,11 September 2021,"If you have liked Mani Ratnam's #Iruvar, you will find Thalaivi overwhelming. In Iruvar, all characters were relatable and grounded, except Aishwarya Rai, who was ethereal by design. So. If you are looking for humanization and subtle nuances of the famous and controversial personalities in their daily lives, please do not watch #Thalaivi. Kangana is no Mohanlal.#thalaivi is intended for the large screen audience that digs in hero worship. Fellows (I included) that grew ear concealing hair and shouted 'jioooo' whenever Amitabh appeared on the screen in the seventies. People who laid prostrate on the roads that MGR or Jayalalitha passed through. This is period drama, in its best moments. It reminded me at times of Jatra Paala, a Bengali popular form of stage performance. It tells more about Kangana, who didn't care to show any shade of a South Indian demeanor, than Thalaivi herself. Kangana's acting seems to be fabricated using the threads from Manikarnika. When she plays younger Jayalalitha, the heroine, she doesn't look the part. As the character grows older and she gets to mouth Amitabh-esque dialogues, she seems more at ease.Storyline picks up incidents from Jaya's life that establishes her as the female protagonist in a male dominated political bastion of the South, more like Kangana has been to the Khans and the Punjabi clans in Mumbai. It carefully avoids the darker shades of the characters and conveniently ends at the scene of Jaya becoming the CM. It's more like 'Making of Jaya', a documentary by the party loyalists. It didn't have to tread the difficult terrain of Jaya's post CM overtures.Technically, it's a regular film. Music is forgettable. Script and dialogues are predictable. Arvind Swamy and Nasser try to look the parts and mostly succeed. Their characters are sketched from the sepia distance of the newspaper readers of yesteryears. I didn't get much meat there. With Bhagyashree and Madhoo, it's more of nostalgia. Actor who stands out is the one who plays antagonist Veerappan, MGR's aide.Biopics are homage or demonization in this country, not really a 360-degree view. Can't blame the producers. It more reflects on us as a country and people. Cinema is an industry and sustains livelihood. It can't risk the wrath of bhakts and fanatics. This film is crafted to avoid controversy while characterizing a highly polarizing person. It does its job.",Thalaivi

123,prathmeshn1992,Solid!,8,30 September 2021,A good story is backed with subtle acting. Kangana has played the role of Amma very well. It's a must watch movie. Arvind has classically portrayed MGR and sadly Naseer Sir has not shared much screen.,Thalaivi

Watching Thalaivi, I didn't realise when Kangana ended and Jaya took over.If the Draupadi scene really happened in TN assembly, the movie showed it beautifully.A tad melodramatic maybe, but one has to give that allowance for South Indian cinema.Kangana is simply brilliant. Coquettish and starry eyed at the outset, loyal and respectful towards the latter part.And the aura around Jaya never diminishes.Sad that Jaya had to spend the last year's of her life in prison.Terrific movie.",Thalaivi

The narrative is way too simple and does no justice to what would be complex characters in real life. The movie does not show the shades of grey in the lead characters (which are bound to be there), and tries to whitewash Jayalalitha into the perfect hero who can do no wrong.The music is even worse, and sounds like no one put any effort in making the sound track.All in all, one more biopic that is poorly executed.",Thalaivi

159,marinarebecca,"Totally Predictable, Avoidable",3,13 September 2021,"I wouldn't call it a worst film and all. But after a good Film, Series and multiple stories and adaptations. I didn't think the film had anything new to offer. And even what was offered was choppy, mismatched, no flow, no connect. There is not much larger than life moments on the screen.The small act in changing room is something I enjoyed. Kangana did look the part (except in the younger phase), but she couldn't do justice to the Tamil version, the lipsync was awful specially in songs. Even important sequences had to be shown in wide only. That mirror scene I actually can't see Ranaut even trying to mouth the words. I would congratulate her for the Bharatanatyam part, eventhough not perfect, it's very tough to pull off.Arvind Swami is able to capture your attention as MGR, he is able to convey his bondage and make him sorry for him (he connects better on an emotional level) but the script falters leaving you confused. Samudrakani leaves an important performance. But the film did feel incomplete, when it's a film to touch the emotions of the people, somehow it lacked depth.I wouldn't call it waste, worthless, terrible but I would call it avoidable. It wasn't necessary to make this film with no new angle.",Thalaivi

I don't know what makes me worthy of writing about such a great soul. I am so proud just to even know her through this movie. It is definitely a brilliant work of art but hard to digest it as film, as I saw the life of my favorite inspirational idol unravel before me.Salute to Kangana ranaut & Arvind Swami who lived this their roles, brought back to life, the two true legends, cherished by all. Kudos to all supporting actors!Each scene is so etched in my heart as it is flowing with sentiments, drama, romance, at one point where Jaya becomes Amma I couldn't control my tears. I became emotional after a long time. Thanks to director A. L. Vijay who cleverly crafted all the time lines of Jaya and MGR. It was quite a difficult task I believe. Music by G. V. Prakash kumar was melodious and soft. All the credits go to the writers from bahubali movie in which lies the life of the movie.The lovely Cinematography by vishal vittal gave an interesting freshness to each and every shot which made the golden Era come back to power. It was almost as if i witnessed the entire story happen right before my eyes.It was so nearly compiled. Title sequence was too emotional to handle. Interval block deserves a special mention as much as the climax which made me satisfied and smiling.You will forever live in all your hearts and mine!I miss you so much!Rest in Peace J.

The movie spans from 60-90s and that particular era is spot on throughout the entire movie. The language, clothes, the colours keep changing according to the decade.

240,pachapaassaravana,Dissappointed screenplay,2,14 September 2021,I expected many historical events of J. Jayalaitha in Tamilnadu politics. Nothing is there. The movie shows the life of jaya from 1965 to 1991. Director written the story very cautiously. He don't want to script the real disputes between jaya and MGR.

It's a must watch movie.As usual Kangana is terrific in her performance. Not just Kangana, Aravind Swamy and his secretary too hDone given very good performances.The movie has a very good grip and it will hold your attention till the end, especially because of Kangana's portrayal of different phases of Jayalalithaa's eventful journey. And for someone who is not much aware with Tamil Nadu politics this gives a pretty good insight. For the first time I was really able to understand who Jayalalithaa was and how strong lady she was.It would have been great to watch this movie in a theatre, but had no other go and had to watch it in Netflix. It's given that if this movie would have released with all the good number of screens, it would have easily crossed 200 crores.",Thalaivi

252,abhishek_worship,Simple yet Stunning,10,11 September 2021,"I watched this movie in a theatre in Perth Australia and the theater was half full. Last week I watched a Hollywood(won't name it as people will get triggered) and the theater just had 7 people, that too on the first Saturday of that movie. This movie is simple yet stunning. No Nepokid can match Kanganaranaut 's talent. She is a powerhouse. 10 stars out of 10 just for Kangana and this movie . The makers of this movie should take a bow for releasing this movie during this Pandemic when the Khans, Roshans , Kapoors of Bollywood are hiding. Even in their short roles Reginaa, Poorna, Madhoo and Bhagyashree leave their mark. Arvind Swamy as MGR is too good. Watch this movie in theaters with your family as you won't feel embarrassed as there aren't any scenes focussing on the navel of the actress or the sweat on her body or her physique, nor are there any scenes focussing on the right shorts of the actor, and yes there are no titillating inserts, for that one can always watch OTT shows.",Thalaivi
253,priyanka-05673,Good one tone watch...a bit too long,6,7 October 2021,The movie in a bit too long by today's standards. But decent story narration and acting was also good by Kangana and Arvind Swamy. But at some point you feel that every Kangana movie becomes a Kangana movie only... The actor cannot be greater than the movie.,Thalaivi
254,kandainderpal,Bad Bad Bad. Waste,1,13 September 2021,"A prententious movie starring self proclaimed queen of cinema resulting in garbage. Too boring. Kangana should stick to whining and venting in front of media, she displays better acting skills there.",Thalaivi

Because of social media some movies having good story line get bad rating and an average movie get higher rating. Social media influence. Well must watch this epic movie.,Thalaivi
258,dr_footswitch,Pretty good and insightful movie,10,18 September 2021,"The movie interestingly portrays the life of late Jayalalitha, the actor turned politician of Tamil Nadu. Hard to capture all her nuances, but the director and the lead actor Ms Ranaut have done a commendable job in bringing her to life for the not so well versed like me. Good work by all concerned with the movie!I don't know why the mischievous repetitious hateful and politically motivated comments have been allowed to hijack this site to share movie reviews. They need to move to some proper place to air their views; this one's not it.",Thalaivi

I'm sure it's Kangana's haters responsible for the low ratings. But seriously, what movie and what a screenplay. You forget that it's a movie and get so engrossed into the life of Jayalalita. And Arvind Swamy is really cherry on the cake. The hard work of the entire team is visible.",Thalaivi

262,yankyash,Amazed to see the effort put in my Filmmaker,8,9 October 2021,I am really amazed to see how well the filmmaker tried to recreate Jayalalitha's life on screen. IFSC purse it's a team effort and it seems everyone has done great job. I have never watched any of Jayalalitha's songs or movies.. but when checked back... such an amazing job recreating everything.. the entire journey is beautifully captured. Very slight difference in Real Vs Reel Thalaivi. Except for the very last scene .. Kangana has looked so convincing in every look. She is BRILLIANT as always. Arvind as MJR is also superb.,Thalaivi
263,lalatenduu,Kangana has done justice to a difficult role,10,12 September 2021,Impersonations are always difficult. And that to when you do to one of the biggest personalities of a political background. Kangana is one of the biggest name in the Hindi film industry but Tamil Film industry has its own fan base. So it was really really difficult for Kangana to impersonate the biography of Jayalalitha. But she seemed flawless. She should be given credit along with Vijay sir.He made the character of Jayalalitha alive again.,Thalaivi

Let alone someone who resembles her.The movie was so dragged out and yet it only managed to scratch only the surface of her story.Aravinda did a good job but he was not enough to carry the movie.I wanted to see Jayalalitha instead I only saw Kangana doing her thing.

The love doesn't have to be dirty, the love doesn't have to be only in one kinda relationship, the love can be cherished from distance, within boundaries, in admiration & respect, it can lead to a lot of strength & power, it can be felt in the way you stand for each other, it doesn't have to be about sleeping together.Standing ovation to Kangana & Thalaivi team for bringing a purity in this movie.And ofcourse, Kangana's unwavering attitude in real life was the core of this movie - the way she gained weight to truly imbibe jaya, the way she looked, spoke & showed both sides of Jaya is respectful.All in all, I appreciate the storyline, the acting, the dialogues, screenplay & every character of this movie.

This is brilliantly plotted I would say. To show a political and personal life of a such legendry human ""Jayalalithaa"" without going out of the line without hurting anyone sentiments was an incredible job. If people like only fake movies like Mimi which only show cooked up and underatedly written on the sensitive topic of adoption, then I cannot say anything.

The performances are stilted, and a complex life is depicted one-dimensionally. Kangana Ranaut was the worst possible choice to play the iconic Jayalalitha, a sorted, dignified lady who stayed calm and powered through even in the midst of adversity. Even so, she was no saint, and the movie is too cowardly to go onto those aspects of her life. Truly a waste of time, especially since the very same story has already been told and told better.",Thalaivi

464,avdheshrana-45789,Such a nice movie to watch,10,11 September 2021,"Nice to watch such a wonderful movie in theater after long time..
Thalaivii - probably the best part of the narrative of the political history of Tamil Nadu. The film is more than politics. It is about a woman's relationship with a man whom she considered everything and her incredible work towards the people of the land who fondly called her Amma. The writers of the film waste no time in establishing that dishonouring a woman would always lead to destruction - Ramayana or Mahabharata.Kangana and Arvind act like the two sides of the same coin - with the same ease and effortlessness. Kangana and Arvind are a delight to watch together. They recreate many iconic moments from MGR and Jayalalithaa's popular movies and prove that a relationship needs both love and acceptance to nurture. Thalaivii surprises you with its story as it cleverly centres the whole politics around the achievement of one woman.",Thalaivi

522,ravi-71549,Wow Flawless,10,12 September 2021,"Kangana's acting was brilliant. To act in a way that it's not too much yet it should look original is a not everyone's cup of tea, atleast none of the present bollywood actors know it. To hate someone like Kangana who has the guts to speak the truth is understandable becoz truth tastes bitter always and not everyone can accept it. But why showing hate to her movies. This is brilliantly plotted I would say. To show a political and personal life of a such legendry human ""Jayalalithaa"" without going out of the line without hurting anyone sentiments was an incredible job. If people like only fake movies like Mimi which only show cooked up and underatedly written on the sensitive topic of adoption, then I cannot say anything. And she didn't simply win ""4national award"" this is for the people who says her to quit acting. I would recommend you people to stop giving reviews on movies as you don't know to criticize good movies.",Thalaivi

Wow this means all these critics were bought by the producers or kangana??😂 is this a joke going in or what!! Thankfully response is quite good 82% bookings on book my show can be seen and yes this is a perfect theatrical release, this film deserves to be watched on big screen. Screenplay written by vijayendra prasad sir is so good it will not let you even move from your seat for 153 minutes it will keep you tied. Acting is top notch kangana as jayalalitha steals the show but arvind swamy as MGR is a treat to watch even supporting cast has done a phenomenal job and you can even relate to them. Direction keeps you tied. Songs and bgms will take you to the 80s vintage era. The Bharatnatyam song wow what a song dude in theatres it goes to another level and chali chali is also a beautiful song. My personal favourite melody was teri aankhon mein. Movie has many wooww moments!! From my side you MUST watch this film. Amma deserved it🔥",Thalaivi

The music is beautiful, it compliments the movie and scenes instead of being odd to the whole experience. A must watch! Miss at your own risk.

Let's practice what we preach and boycott any person associated with Bollywood because they have murdered SSR. Kangana Ranaut is the biggest opportunistic woman I have ever seen. First milk a fan base out of Sushant because her films are going flop since 2016, then shake hands with the mafia after all the nautanki is done and got her sarkaari chaaploosi award, she is saying Sushant should not have 'committed suicide'.

I'm all In with North Indian actress to portray South Indian lady. Kangana did well on the dance. But you are missing one thing, Jayalalitha speaks Tamil, the dub, lip movement from Kangana ruined it. How she carried herself throughout out the movie is good.

619,anandchand-88032,Brilliant,9,11 September 2021,"Finally watched Thalaivi movie in theatre. Watching movie in hall after 2yrs.I would rate 4/5 and 9/10
MGR death scene is so good projected. Last half will give good goosebumps. First half is full of Jayalalitha dance moves/ film act that were exactly recreated and romantic angle were shown.second half is where politics starts and MGR death. Lots of dialogue from Mahabharat.Since it was 2hrs movie,they tried to rush so many good scenes which felt incomplete to me. I feel Tamil audiences will understand this movie better than north audiences as the political factor is between Karunanidhi and MGR and background of Jaya. Acting wise everyone gave justice to there role. The director has selected each and every character exactly matching like MGR, Karunanidhi, Jayalalitha, Indra Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi etc. He has successfully created the 70's era of Tamil cinema and a Very beautiful depiction of some of the most important events in Amma's life.Go for it. You wont regret!!",Thalaivi

656,vallathnarendran,Kangana is par excellence,9,12 September 2021,What a versatile and brilliant acting by both Aravind Seamy and kangana. Of coz a biopic has its limitations. When a known story is represented and that too before a section of the audience who know the story inside out and another section to whom the story is quite unknown it is difficult to make it impressive and attention catching to both group.

3 days agoA very inspiring film about the life of Dr. J. Jayalalithaa ji. The story of the very strong lady who faughts against patriachy and made her mark. The film totally did justice to her character. Kangana Ranaut is at her best, It can be said that this is the most challenging role for her till date and she has done fabulous work. She really lived this character.Arvind Swami is too good as Mr. M. G. R and his on screen chemistry with Kangana is wonderful. Also to mention Nassar and Raj Arjun they did wonderful act.G. V. Prakash Kumar's music and score is top notch and I had goosebumps moments. The cinematography, set design, Camera work and the costume by neeta lulla is a treat to witness on big screen. Really enjoyed watching this film.A. L. Vijay is the best director his work is excellent.

He stole the show.Nasser as Karuna...silent but a powerful role.RNV Samuthirakani ...calm and composed...his eyes speak...great acting skills.Thambi Ramaiah a very humble pillar of support to the main character ,so naive but a touching character.Madhoo as Janaki Amma and Bhagyashree as Sandhya Amma...have played their roles well. Happy to see all of the beautiful heroines in one movie.Well written script...heart soothing dialogues...jaw dropping cinematography...music by GV PRAKASH...every single song and the bgm score flies like a feather in one's heart...
Every single frame has been directed so well...an eye to detail...Madras recreated in a very realistic manner...the director has taken INDIAN CINEMA to a different level which reaches the International audience too,proving that Indian Cinema has the best directors who work hard,every drop of sweat is their blood which they shed when directing every single movie. And i believe director Vijay has shed blood and tears from the time the movie was discussed till this day of release.Thank you Director Vijay for giving the society a wonderful movie during this pandemic period.The movie will reach great heights.Congratulations to every single person on screen and behind the screen.I pray to God that the National Award for the best movie of the year goes to Thalavii and the crew.Happy GANESH Chathurthi!",Thalaivi

She has admitted to this many times. Sadly, as an actor, she is unable to detach herself with her real personality. The arrogance, the rudeness, the castigator she is in her real life, is seen in her character in this movie. The worst is her dialogue delivery. It is un unbearable, in fact painful to watch.

She was the best choice for playing this role as she herself is lot like JJ, bold and determined in a world where women are not given much respect. She brings out JJ's mannerisms and strong attitude.The language is a barrier to playing the role of a regional politician and the dubbing may have been flawed in places, but the essence of JJ's personal and political persona was played very well.",Thalaivi

To act in a way that it's not too much yet it should look original is a not everyone's cup of tea, atleast none of the present bollywood actors know it. To hate someone like Kangana who has the guts to speak the truth is understandable becoz truth tastes bitter always and not everyone can accept it. But why showing hate to her movies. This is brilliantly plotted I would say. To show a political and personal life of a such legendry human ""Jayalalithaa"" without going out of the line without hurting anyone sentiments was an incredible job. If people like only fake movies like Mimi which only show cooked up and underatedly written on the sensitive topic of adoption, then I cannot say anything. I would recommend you people to stop giving reviews on movies as you don't know to criticize good movies.",Thalaivi

Kangana has shown to the world that if you have talent, you can change the rules.Kangana portrays the late Jayalalitha, who is young and vulnerable in the 1st half, and determined and has a goal in the 2nd. She showcased both these phases beautifully.This movie isn't like Sanju, which is meant to whitewash someone's image. You see the character making wrong choices & paying for it.

When you see her you dont see Jaya but same Kangana you saw in past movies and mediocre acting. In addition to that, the makeup/prostetic were bad and it literally blocks any facial expressions.The only good thing about it was Arvind Swamy's MGR.",Thalaivi

1291,sankhamukherjee,Need a Second Part,10,13 September 2021,"Thalaivii... much waited movie. Because I love political drama movies. When I saw Thalaivii I felt very happy that regional director made a superb decision to make biography. First of all Kangana, she nailed the character and delivering an awesome performance. May be the movie is not in the box office big collection row but it will be remembered to all of us. It is a perfect time when we should decide whether a movie for big numbers or a movie for best performance or both. If you saw Rituparna Ghosh Bariwala you definitely picked Number two; best performance. I am not a big fan of Kangana but I must admired her capabilities. And this movie definitely need a second part where I want to see the roller-coaster life of Jaya. Lots of wishes from kolkata.",Thalaivi

1294,abhipuec,Cancel culture will lead us nowhere,10,13 September 2021,"Sad to see political biases in clear portrayal. Cancel culture in full display.I thought it was 8 or 8.5/10 but seeing the hateful reviews I need to give it a 10 though it wasn't a 10, nor a 9. For me, both Kangana and Tapsee are good actors irrespective of their political views. Their dedication towards their craft is appreciable.Kangana's acting is very convincing and real. Story premise, screenplay, direction is also decent. Jayalalitha was definitely a very enigmatic character and this movie surely does put some good light over that. Definitely an entertaining movie.",Thalaivi

1300,navreenbrar,What is up with Bollywood's obsession with overdramatized biopics with songs?,1,16 September 2021,"The first half of it was literally so boring that I was scrolling through my phone to get to the good part and to be fair it did get exciting but predictable in the second half of it. I just ended up being disappointed. Kangana is a good actor no doubt but she just could not embody the role of Jayalalitha.1. I clicked on Jayalalitha's biopic and all I saw was Kangana being a weird version of herself. She was just doing her thing which doesn't work in a biopic.2. Glad that they showed the harassment but where were her achievements and all that she did for Tamil Nadu? They made a movie on a political figure and forgot to dive into the political parts. They also missed so many parts of her life! What a disrespect!3. I don't know how to explain this but north and south have very different cultures that influences our behavior in life. Due to that Kangana just stood out very weirdly and I had high hopes everything looked awesome from first look to trailer but in the movie whenever she acted it just felt 'north like'. Which is a major reason for Aravinda's success in this.4. The background score! It was so hard to focus on the movie because of it. So annoying, watch it once and you'll know. There are so many reviews out there that gave it 10 stars which is so crazy.5. The speech- oh God it was so stupid. Kangana doesn't know Tamil and the lip sync was bad. It just ruined the movie for me.6. They had so much interesting stuff to work with but instead they decided to make it a commercial movie by overacting, cutting out the intense parts and adding awful music and casting a big name from bollywood instead of someone who knew Amma and who could've done her role a justice.All in all, it was not at all a good biopic and I hope someone will make a BETTER biopic of her because she deserved it. Maybe next time cast someone from South India and preferably someone who resembles her? And maybe make a realistic biopic instead of overdramatizing it and adding music. Her story doesn't need dramatizing it already is such a fascinating one that'll hook in the viewer. Do better guys.",Thalaivi
1301,ankit_bassi,The best movie of 2021,10,11 September 2021,"Must watch.wonderful acting, screenplay and a lot of hardwork by the team.",Thalaivi
1302,beeper-74900,Excellent acting and Brilliant Actress in most difficult Role,10,13 September 2021,South India is the only region in India where Politics mix well with movie stardom. Jayalalitha once a dancer and actress in Tamil movie became a successful politician in south India and rose to become the chief minister or head of Indian state. This reminds me of Ronald Reagan who became Governor of California and then President Of United states. I don't know if Kangana has any political ambition but her earlier views on politics may surprise many. We wish her best in her endeavors and make her country proud of her.,Thalaivi
1303,piyuusshh,"LOL all anti nationals are giving 1* here to show the movie is bad, but its actually 10*",10,14 September 2021,"Another National Award for Kangana Ranaut!Kangana mesmerises with yet another powerhouse performance. She is simply superb as Jayalalitha, and does more than justice to the character.
