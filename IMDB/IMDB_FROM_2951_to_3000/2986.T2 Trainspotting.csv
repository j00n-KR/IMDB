0,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, but very superficial",5,27 February 2019,"I was never a huge fan of the original TRAINSPOTTING - I find REQUIEM FOR A DREAM to be a much better anti-drug movie - so I wasn't too fussed about this sequel either. As expected, it's another case of style, style, style over very little in the way of real substance. A series of random vignettes play out depicting the sad characters of the original some 20 years later, with lots of lazy direction in which music is used to evoke emotion rather than strong writing (the soundtrack is admittedly good, but that's beside the point). The script is littered with profanity but no depth, and the actors get little to do, although I did enjoy seeing Robert Carlyle as the hard man again. It's not a bad film, but there's little to think about or discuss afterwards.",T2 Trainspotting
1,SnoopyStyle,echoes of the past,6,14 September 2017,"It's been 20 years. Mark 'Rent Boy' Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns from Amsterdam to find Edinburgh changed. He reconnects with Daniel 'Spud' Murphy (Ewen Bremner) and Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson (Jonny Lee Miller) after giving them £4000 to make up for his betrayal. Simon has been pimping out his girlfriend Veronika and blackmailing her clients. When a client goes to the police, the guys seek help from former girlfriend Diane Coulston (Kelly Macdonald) who is now a solicitor. Spud has been struggling with heroine and daylight savings time. Meanwhile, Franco Begbie (Robert Carlyle) has been in prison all this time. He escapes and when he runs into Rent Boy, he intends to get his revenge.There is an exuberant energy to Danny Boyle's original. The actors were so young and everything heightened. It is a desperate, devastating, memorable, and fun journey. There are unforgettable scenes. This one is an echo of that past. An echo can still be compelling. Many of the characters are back and we get a nice visit with them. They renew their relationships. It just doesn't have the same power. It is a few steps down. While the characters return, the sense of place and time is disconnected. In a way, the characters are out of place and time. The world has passed them by and they are collapsing on themselves. It's sad and fitting. They are fading and so is this sequel. It's definitely not as shocking or groundbreaking anymore.",T2 Trainspotting
2,Horst_In_Translation,You don't need to know the original to enjoy this one,6,10 March 2017,"This is ""T2 Trainspotting"" or ""Trainspotting 2"" or ""Porn"", a British movie from 2017 that runs for slightly under 2 hours and was written by Danny Boyle. of course, this is the sequel to the 1996 film ""Trainspotting"" and 20 years passed in real life and 20 years also passed in the story here. But we'll get to that later. Boyle is an Oscar winner now and the writer is once again John Hodge, who adapted the Irvine Welsh novels for the screen here. For the 20-year-old original film, Hodge received his only Academy Award nomination so far. But lets take a look at this modern movie now. Despite the pretty massive runtime I already mentioned, it never drags, or almost never. It takes a little while to really develop an interest in the story and characters, but this is maybe also because I don't know the 1996 film. As for this one here, I think my favorite performance came from Jonny Lee Miller, even if Ewan McGregor fans may disagree as much as those who love Begbie and Spud. So it is certainly nice that Boyle got all these people back in again for this sequel. Kelly Macdonald has a one-scene performance too.This film was pretty gritty and intense to watch and even if you (hopefully?) do not identify with any of the characters in here, it's easy to care for what will happen next to them, the good and the (way more frequent) bad. Carlyle turns into a pretty nice antagonist the longer the film goes and Spud is probably the most likable of the bunch. This movie is definitely a good mix of crime drama and comedy, as there are always moments that will have you laugh out loud, like the ways in which one character gets out of jail, or the entire scene in a bar where the two protagonists just want to steal a few credit cards, but are told to perform on stage. This was maybe the most hilarious part of the film. I think all the actors gave good performances in here too. Nothing ever felt fake and stale and that's certainly a good thing. But I still think this is more of a film that shines through its writing and honestly, I also felt Boyle's direction was extraordinarily well done and I'd have been perfectly fine with him receiving a nomination at the Oscars again, but it was not the right film I guess for that. Or is he only eligible for the 2018 Oscars? I am not sure. Anyway, if he keeps that level, he will pretty soon, no doubt about it.Finally, as I already wrote in the title I have not seen the original ""Trainspotting"", but it's a gap I plan to close at some point in the future for sure. This sequel here got me certainly curious about that older movie. It's not that I would say I have to see it right away, but I am pretty curious about the characters' past. Of course, there were some spoilers in this new movie, but I don't think it is a problem as Boyle and Hodge made it in a way where you basically get all the information to enjoy this 2017 release as a stand-alone movie as well without knowing that the 1996 film even exists. ""Trainspotting 2"" is a success, no doubt about it, carried by Boyle's strong vision from start to finish and while true greatness is a rarity, the overall outcome is engaging and engaging during the entirety of its 2 hours. See it.",T2 Trainspotting
3,Prismark10,Less to choose,6,15 October 2017,"T2 Trainspotting is a stuttering choppy trippy sequel made 21 years after the original film and lacks its offbeat dynamics because the central story is not strong enough.Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns to Edinburgh 20 years after ripping off his friends. He says he had a health scare but his friends are not in a forgiving mood and life has not moved on much for them.Sick Boy also known as Simon (Jonny Lee Miller) still does drugs as well blackmailing people who uses the services of his Bulgarian prostitute.Spud (Ewen Bremner) managed to get off drugs and then went back on them. He has reached the end of his tether as he contemplates suicide.Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is in prison, still a violent psychopath but one with a plan to escape from jail.Simon and Renton plan to raise money to start a sauna which will masquerade as a brothel. However both know they will likely rip each other off, with Begby on the loose looking for revenge it is only a matter of time they cross paths and try to run away from each other.Danny Boyle went on to great things in the last 20 years including winning a best director Oscar, but this train rather hit the buffers.",T2 Trainspotting
4,kosmasp,Terminator still the ultimate T2,7,8 July 2017,"But that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie. And the marketing trick (I'll call it that) was pretty neat. Most people still think of Terminator when they read T2 (by the way that movie is coming to back to cinemas apparently in 2017 in a 3D version). So this dives in to where the other Trainspotting left off.Of course many years after, as the actors have aged too in that time. But we do get familiar faces and new relationships between the characters. We also get a new female lead. I have to admit, I was looking forward to see the one from the original back on, but I reckon they had other plans. She is mentioned of course. It's not as crazy out there as the original, but it still has its moments (some are spoiled in the trailer). I thought it was good enough with a good story and character arc. Some dialogue is almost incoherent, which is on purpose if you're not completely familiar with the accent ... but you know about this, if you know the original",T2 Trainspotting
5,jboothmillard,T2 Trainspotting,6,5 February 2017,"The original Trainspotting was a huge phenomenon in 1996 and has become incorporated into British popular culture, it was exciting to find out that twenty years later there would be a sequel, based on the original Trainspotting book and its sequel, Porno, by Irvine Welsh, directed by Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, The Beach, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours). Basically Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton (Ewan McGregor) has returned from his home in Amsterdam to Edinburgh, since the death of his mother (Eileen Nicholas), Renton's father (James Cosmo) has been living alone. Meanwhile Daniel ""Spud"" Murphy (Ewen Bremner) continues to struggle with heroin addiction, which impacts on his long-suffering partner Gail (Shirley Henderson) and their son; Simon ""Sick Boy"" Williamson (Jonny Lee Miller) works as a landlord in pub the Port Sunshine, which he inherited, but continues a sideline doing dodgy deals, blackmailing and growing cannabis; and Francis ""Franco"" Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is serving a twenty- five year prison sentence, he is denied parole for his violent temper. Renton finds Spud attempting suicide, he saves him but does not get an immediate welcome return, Renton wants to help Spud overcome his heroin addiction and reconcile with Sick Boy, who remains angry at Renton for his betrayal, stealing the money twenty years ago. Sick Boy initially pretends to be happy to see Renton, but they have a fight, until eventually Renton gives Sick Boy £4,000, his share of the money stolen. Begbie purposely hospitalises himself to make his escape, he briefly reunites with his wife and son, before visiting Sick Boy, Begbie wants revenge on Renton, so Sick Boy goes along with the ruse that he wants to help him, Renton meanwhile has Spud start exercising as a way to cure his heroin addiction. Renton decides to stay in Edinburgh, he explains to Sick Boy that his marriage is ending and was only returning to Amsterdam to move out from the house his wife owns, he also tells that he suffered a heart attack months ago and he has a stent. Sick Boy wants to establish a leisure club at his pub, so he, his ""girlfriend"" Veronika Kovach (Anjela Nedyalkova) and Renton travel to Glasgow to the Orange Lodge to pickpocket the assembled crowd, the unsuspicious landlord refuses to let them leave without a song, so they improvise a song about the Battle Of The Boyne in 1690, with the ""there were no more Catholics left!"" They access the accounts they can with the many stolen bank cards, using the assumed pin number 1690, Sick Boy and Renton make a presentation to the Scottish Parliament to secure development funds for the club. While on the run, Begbie burgles houses, taking his son Frank Jr. along, but his son aspires to attend college, he sells the stolen good to successful ""businessman"" Mikey Forrester (Irvine Welsh), while there he steals bags of Viagra tablets. Begbie take some of the Viagra tablets and goes into a nightclub, Renton and Sick Boy are there celebrating, while in the toilets Renton and Begbie accidentally meet, Renton is chased into a car parking centre, but eventually manages to escape Begbie, who is left with an unwanted erection. Begbie visits Spud to find out where Renton is, he finds Spud is writing about the group's past exploits, Veronika comes to visit Spud, Begbie uses her mobile to message Renton and Sick Boy into a meeting at the pub. Spud was able to move the funds for the pub into Veronika's account, she offers Spud half of the money, but he refuses it, knowing he would spend it on drugs, so he sends his share to Gail and his son Fergus (Kyle Fitzpatrick). Renton and Sick Boy arrive at the pub, Spud is in time to warn them that Begbie has set a trap, Begbie arrives and a fight ensues, Simon is knocked unconscious and Renton is chased to the roof, Renton falls and is caught in cables, he almost chokes to death, Begbie watches, but he is attacked by Sick Boy and Spud, Renton is saved, and Begbie is knocked out by Spud before he can fire a shotgun. In the end, Begbie is put in a car boot and driven back to prison, Veronika keeps the money she stole to return to Bulgaria and reunite with her son (Emil Bonev), Spud begins a career as a writer, his writings form the basis of a book which Gail names ""Trainspotting"", Renton and Sick Boy reconcile their friendship, and Renton moves back into his parent's house. Also starring Kelly Macdonald as Diane and Inside I'm Dancing's Steven Robertson as Stoddart. It should be mentioned that the title Trainspotting comes from a scene that never appeared in the original film, where the friends were in a trainspotting and encountered a drunk, so it is good to see this scene appear in this sequel to explain that fact. McGregor remains brilliant as the smart-aleck former junkie, Carlyle is still stunning as the unhinged, enraged psychopath, and the returning supporting stars are also great, Boyle's direction still has enough flair and intelligence, it is not so much much about the ins and outs of drug-taking, it is more about the difficult relationships between the characters, and the impact that time has had on them, there is still hard-hitting material, but plenty more laughs to be had along the way, and another memorable soundtrack, a most worthwhile black comedy drama. Good!",T2 Trainspotting
6,paul_haakonsen,A sequel that wasn't overly necessary...,6,9 June 2018,"This movie was actually something that caught me by surprise, as I didn't know about it prior to finding it by sheer luck.The first ""Trainspotting"" movie was definitely unique, so I had high hopes for the sequel.However, it was slower paced and had a much less interesting story in comparison to the first movie.They took way too long in between the two movies, so this sequel feels obsolete already and seems rather pointless.""T2 Trainspotting"" has some good acting from a nicely cast ensemble of actors, and it is nice to see the original actors return to reprise their characters. It was of course nice to see Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Ewen Bremner and so forth to perform here and brining more insanity to the screen. For me, it was a particular treat to see Robert Carlyle back, because his character was by far the most interesting in the first movie.Adequately entertaining for sure, but nothing outstanding here in this sequel.",T2 Trainspotting

8,Theo Robertson,Belated But Brilliant Sequel To The Brit Cult Classic,8,16 March 2017,"The original TRAINSPOTTING remains a legendary British film . There can't be a Briton who is unaware of it . How well regarded is it abroad you ask ? Let me put it like this: Whenever I'm in an Indo-Aryan land and someone asks me where I'm from the conversation goes something like this ""Hey my friend where you from ?"" ""Scotland . Have you seen Trainspotting ?"" ""Oh yes . Jason Statham"" I'm always flattered to be mistaken with an action hero and it's a very easy mistake to make confusing me with the star of THE TRANSPORTER since we both have the exact same hairstyle but there's no way I'm going to say I'm from the land made famous by Mel Gibson and his cries of ""Freedom"" so I have to explain it's the film about Edinburgh junkies starring Ewan McGregor , Robert Carlyle etc . Cue more and more perplexed looks from my indigenous host In short despite its legendary status in this country it's not as well known as Brits in general and Scots in particular like to think . Much of this might be down to Danny Boyle being the kind of director who doesn't really make commercial films for an international audience even though the world fell in love with SLUMDOG MILLIONIRE . There's also the other element of why wait 20 years to do a sequel ? It's almost like a once highly regarded band bringing out an album of cover versions , almost an official admission of ""We're not even trying here but we want your money for old rope"" If like me you went in to watch T2 with this thinking then you'll be very surprised . The things you liked about the original are recreated here - the grotesque black comedy , Carlyle's psychotic performance are cloned so perfectly you'd think it started filming the day after TRAINSPOTTING stopped One thing I thought this sequel improved over the original is that it's clearly filmed in Edinburgh . Many of the exterior shots are of obvious Edinburgh locations such as Muirhouse , Clerk St , Cable Winds , Grassmarket etc . There is a very obvious fly in the ointment to all this and that is because it's set twenty years after the original (Late 1980s) the white elephant trams wouldn't have existed at this point in time . Despite this small anachronism if you loved the first film you will love this one One puzzling thing about its release is why did it get released just after the cut-off point for the award season ? John Hodge was Oscar nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay in 1996 and unfortunately it seems the distributors didn't seem to have enough faith in it to at least try to receive some awards . This is a pity because I had faith in the production and Boyle and co have repaid my faith by making what may well be the best British film of the year",T2 Trainspotting
9,grantss,Great follow-up to a brilliant movie,8,24 February 2017,"20 years after betraying his friends and running off with (almost) all the money from a scam, Mark Renton is back in Edinburgh. It is his first time back since the events that split him, Spud and Simon apart. He looks up Spud and Simon but their lives are hardly much better than when he last saw them. Spud, after getting his life together, has seen it all unravel, to the point that he is suicidal. Simon is running his father's loss-making pub, in between bouts of blackmail. Meanwhile, the fourth person in their caper of 20 years' ago, the psychotically intense Begbie, is in jail. He has no intention of staying incarcerated and revenge is foremost on his mind...The original Trainspotting was brilliant. Funny, gritty and harrowing it dealt with the issue of drug addiction in a suffocatingly intense yet humorous way. It wasn't just about drug addiction but friendship and, ultimately, about a crime caper and betrayal. Directed by Danny Boyle, who directed Trainspotting 1, Trainspotting 2 doesn't have the grimness of the first movie, as the drug addiction side is hardly a factor. For me, that is what made Trainspotting 1 a masterpiece, the way it covered drug addiction in a realistic yet humorous manner. T2 is more about friendship and the after-effects of T1's betrayal, resulting it being more of an action-revenge sort of movie. Plot is good, though there are some contrivances and inconsistencies. Quite emotional at times too, as we see some loops from T1 closed, friends reunited and 40-somethings taking stock of their lives.Humour-wise, T2 is great, and as good as, if not better than, T1. Some very funny scenes and dialogue.Not essential that you've watched T1 to follow and enjoy T2, as there are enough flashbacks and other clues to fill you in on what happened in T1. However, watching T1 before T2 certainly would help the experience. There are plenty of side-references and subtle nods to T1 and these enhance the enjoyment of T2.Overall, a great movie, though not in the same league as Trainspotting 1. Very funny at times, with a good plot and some interesting themes.",T2 Trainspotting
10,george.schmidt,The boys are back in this welcome sequel; one of the year's best films.,10,30 March 2017,"T2 TRAINSPOTTING (2017) **** Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller, Anjela Nedyalkova, Kelly Macdonald, Shirley Henderson, James Cosmo, Pauline Turner, Scot Greenan. The boys are back - Scotland's bad boys that is in this welcome sequel to the indie classic about four friends whose drug habits got them into a crime that ended poorly for three has them reunited when Renton (McGregor) comes back home for the funeral of his estranged mother and finds his buds Simon aka Sick Boy (Miller) and Spud (Bremner) more or less the same but with grudges and smack still in the mix, and a vengeful Begbie (Carlyle) busting out of prison for murderous score settling. Based on Irvine Welsh's novels, John Hodge's screenplay echoes the original perfectly as well as filmmaker Danny Boyle's sharp directing skills intact. Fine acting by the foursome and a nice, canny turn by Nedyalkova as Sick Boy's love interest and partner-in-crime the film has underpinnings of genuine poignancy (largely due to a bittersweet performance by Bremner) and a great re-hash of the Choose Life speech by McGregor that hits the floor running. One of the best films of the year.",T2 Trainspotting
11,ferguson-6,catching up,6,23 March 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sequels are big business in Hollywood these days. In fact, it's not unusual for sequels to be announced even before the premiere of the first! At the other end of the spectrum we have cult films which carry the added pressure of not disappointing (or worse) their rabid fan base. Such is the case with Trainspotting from 1996. So the big question is  can the much anticipated follow up generate the frenetic pace and enjoyable discomfort of the first? Director Danny Boyle (and his Oscar from Slumdog Millionaire) is back at the helm, and re-joining him is writer John Hodge who is once again working with the main characters from Irvine Welsh's source novels. Of course what has the fans excited is the reunion of Ewan McGregor as Mark Renton, Ewen Bremner as Spud, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy Simon, and Robert Carlyle as Begbie. Despite high expectations and fear of disappointment, it's difficult to imagine the fans not having a blast with this second go round. Sure, the boys are a bit older – but to say they are much wiser, would be stretching things farther than these off-kilter blokes already do.For reasons never really made clear, Mark returns to face the fellows he left high and dry some twenty years ago. Perhaps it's guilt and he accepts that he deserves a good ass-kicking, or perhaps he simply realized he didn't belong anywhere else. Simon has an attractive new partner named Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova), who seems to be the one generating whatever income the couple has. Spud is still struggling mightily with his addiction, while Begbie is planning a quite painful escape from prison.The reunions happen separately and slowly throughout the film, and each carries its own awkwardness. These guys are all similar to the guys we know, yet nobody's quite the same. It's not until near the end when all four share a scene. However, getting to that point involves everything we could hope for: flashbacks, quirky camera angles, flash-cut edits, familiar music blasting, and exaggerated sound effects  in other words, all of the style from the original (only with a higher budget).Also making return appearances are Kelly McDonald as Diane (only one scene), novelist Irvine Welsh (this time buying stolen goods from Begbie), and the always great Shirley Henderson as Gail, whose single line of dialogue is pitch perfect. It's nice that Ewen Bremner gets such an interesting and unexpected path in this sequel, and we can't help but smile at director Boyle's tributes to David Bowie, Stanley Kubrick, and of course, his original Trainspotting. You may ask why and in what form, but it's clear all four main characters have decided to ""choose life"". The next cult favorite up for sequel treatment is 1982's Blade Runner, which likely faces an even more challenging journey to satisfy fans from 35 years ago.",T2 Trainspotting
12,FlashCallahan,21 years later.........,8,29 January 2017,"This was such a risk. Making a sequel to probably the most iconic British film of all time. Trainspotting was an important piece of cinema when first released, because it was released at a point when Britain was going through a change.Designer clothes, Brit Pop, generation X, Blair, technology becoming more important than a person. I was very lucky to be at an age where the film called to me. I was nineteen when Trainspotting was first released, and it's remained in my top ten films of all time since.T2 is a very good, Boyle has achieved the impossible by getting the cast back together and putting in performances as visceral and humanistic as they did when the cast were fairly new to fame. But this film made them household names, and I guarantee these are the characters that they will be remembered for.Story wise, there really isn't that much going on other than people wanting revenge, betrayal, and realising that no matter how nostalgic you are about the past, it cannot take away the pain of the self realisation that your days are numbered.And this is where the main problem with the film lies, it relies way too much of referencing the original, showing flashbacks, referencing very iconic scenes (although the scene where Renton is climbing through a hole in the exact same way he climbed out of the toilet is genius), it just keeps reminding the audience of why that film has become a crucial part of modern culture.Carlyle steals the film, and he's as scary and as monstrous as you remember him. Every scene with him in is perfect cinema, and it does make the other performances feel a little stilted. Bremner is the foundation of the films narrative, and a scene involving him and Begbie reliving the past is touching, and terrifying.the final third has a wonderful Bladerunner feel to it, and Boyle has flashes of genius in the film.The toilet scene where two characters realise whom one another are is tense and frustratingly hilarious, and a set piece involving Renton and Simon improvising a song is a wonderfully funny moment.It's not a bad film by any means, I really enjoyed and in all fairness it could have been a complete disaster. But it references the original just too much, it would have been fine without them, We see the film because we care about the characters, they are like old friends, and you always wondered what happened to them.Now you know.",T2 Trainspotting
13,deloudelouvain,Nothing compared to it's predecessor,6,12 July 2017,"I remember watching the first Trainspotting twenty years ago. I remember how much I liked that timeless movie. I thought Danny Boyle did an outstanding job in that time. So I was very excited about watching the sequel after twenty years. But all in all it was disappointing. I just sat it through. Maybe I had too high of expectations but during the entire movie you have that feeling that it will never get better or even close to the first Trainspotting. You can't really blame the actors, that aged very well, because they just play their roles like you should expect of them but the story this time is just not as entertaining. Too bad because it had potential to be another classic but unfortunately this one won't be a classic. I remember watching the first one over and over again. This is not going to happen with this one. Okay to watch once but that's about it.",T2 Trainspotting
14,siderite,"Amazingly nostalgic, good, but not even close to as good as the first",8,1 December 2017,"I loved the first Trainspotting movie and I waited a long time before I gathered enough courage to watch T2. Is it good? Would it ruin Trainspotting for me? Is it a sequel, a remake, a thing of its own?In the end I liked it, but all I can compare it to is a remix. It's like various scenes and sketches from the first movie were moved around in order to create the narrative of the same people 20 years later. I didn't feel that there was enough character development, but a lot of nostalgia about the first film and Scotland from two decades ago.I liked how they wrapped it all up. If Trainspotting was a great gift of a movie, T2 feels like a very nice gift wrapping. People who liked the first film will like this one. People who have not seen Trainspotting will understand nothing.What I didn't like was the entire Veronika thing. It felt forced and not really relevant. They were the four musketeers, the lost boys, there was always a girl, but it was about them. Her character felt superfluous.Bottom line: enjoyed it, I am glad I have seen it, but I hoped for something different, something fleshier, grittier, more personal. The first film ended up on a hopeful note. After a lot of nostalgia, this one kind of ended up despondent.",T2 Trainspotting
15,Hellmant,"A really well made sequel, as far as sequels go (20-years later).",9,14 April 2017,"'T2 TRAINSPOTTING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Danny Boyle's sequel to his beloved 1996 cult classic 'TRAINSPOTTING', reuniting all of the original cast members (more than 20-years later)! It was also once again scripted by John Hodge, and based on the books 'Trainspotting', and it's sequel 'Porno', by Irvine Welsh. The story revolves around Mark Renton returning to Edinburgh, and attempting to make amends with the friends he betrayed 20-years earlier (in the original film). It's filled with nostalgic clips from the original movie, serving as flashbacks, and Ewan McGregor, Johnny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle all reprise their roles. Kelly Macdonald returns for a cameo appearance, and Anjela Nedyalkova joins the cast. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been a hit at the international Box Office as well. I enjoyed it quite a bit.After stealing the money Mark Renton and his friends stole together, 20-years earlier, Renton fled to Amsterdam with it, and he's been living there (unhappily) all of this time. He returns home to Edinburgh to try and make amends with those he betrayed, and he finds Spud (Bremner) still addicted to heroine and trying to commit suicide. Mark is able to stop him, and he then attempts to get Spud to quit drugs as well. Sick Boy (Miller) is now running his aunt's pub, while he's also addicted to cocaine, and blackmailing others with his Bulgarian girlfriend (Nedyalkova). He also still holds a big grudge against Mark, for stealing his money decades earlier. Begbie (Carlyle) holds the biggest grudge though, and he breaks out of prison wanting revenge.I'm not a huge fan of the original film; I've only seen it once though (when it originally came out) and I don't really remember it that well. This sequel definitely refreshed my memory, through it's many flashback scenes. I have friends, and family, that love the first film though, and I'm sure they'd probably find this sequel to be very nostalgic, and possibly somewhat emotional. I was really moved by it, and (like I said) I'm not even an obsessive fan of it's predecessor. I'm sure the first film is probably better, but this sequel is still really well written, acted and directed. It's a really well made sequel, as far as sequels go (20-years later).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/213917579",T2 Trainspotting
16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"As successful as any sequel could hope to be, and generally fine",9,29 January 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Twenty years after he double crossed his friends and made off with all their ill gotten gains, Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns home to Edinburgh to make amends with his them, including Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), who's getting by doing sexual extortions with his Bulgarian girlfriend, but has plans to open his own sauna cum brothel, and Spud (Ewen Bremner) whose simple minded nature has scuppered his chances of living a drug free life and is on the verge of suicide. But just as Mark has returned to settle the score with his friends, so the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle) escapes from custody, and the scene is set for a cataclysmic showdown from which nothing will be the same.In a time when sequels to successful franchises, or even just cult hits, are becoming ten a penny, the always on the cards Trainspotting sequel is one that fans have justifiably had to wait a long time for. Rather than being something that got made just to try and flog a dead horse, the advent of time has worked well here, since it's far more interesting to see how these characters have gone over the course of twenty years than it would have been just a few years afterwards. The course of time has also allowed for a film to be appreciated in its own right, rather than being compared to the first film, with the older characters now more sober and reflective, in contrast to the high energy, in your face relentlessness of the first film.That's not to say that the film doesn't have it's own slant to take on the modern day world, most notably with Renton's 'choose life' speech from the first film modified to include Facebook and reality TV, and it's just as relevant and insightful but, like everything else, just slower and more considered than in the first film. It also comes more toward the end of the film than the start of it, which just goes to show how more slow and considered Danny Boyle wanted to make it. Even the pulsating soundtrack from the first film is used here in a more gentle way, including a maudlin use of Born Slippy.While it's all very interesting catching up with these guys in the first half, the second part loses focus somewhat, and it starts to meander without any solid story and ends up dragging on slightly. But it's still a worthwhile, satisfying update, full of sly nods to its predecessor, and a sobering contrast between the energy and expectancy of what could be and the downbeat, depressing reality of what becomes. ****",T2 Trainspotting
17,paul2001sw-1,Tourists in our own past,7,27 February 2017,"'Trainspotting', Irvine Welsh's grimy, blackly comedic novel about the Edinbugh underworld, famously became a cult sensation in the 1990s; and reached a wider audience through Danny Boyle's high-energy film version. Many years later, Welsh wrote a sequel, 'Porno', and now, Boyle has also followed suit, although 'T2: Trainspotting' is only partly based on that second book. More to the point, at one moment, the character of Sick Boy comments that he feels like a tourist, visiting his own past, and in some ways this observation is at the heart of the second movie: after over 20 years, this is a more sentimental film than its shocking predecessor, and some of that sentiment is extrinsic, as the film plays off the audience's desire to know what happened next. This doesn't all work: presenting Welsh's novels as supposedly the work of the character Spud meets the scriptwriters' desire to tie up loose ends, but it's unnecessary and not entirely plausible. It's also a bit disappointing to see that it isn't actually filmed in Leith but in a more generic, imagined setting of urban decay (giveaway: there are no passenger train lines in Leith any more). It's still a lively film, and those who haven't read the books will finally learn where the title comes from, but the very fact that the protagonists have survived to some extent undermines the fundamental bleakness of the original. No-one who watched that film will fail to take some pleasure from the sequel; but as with many second takes, it's unnecessary where part one was essential.",T2 Trainspotting
18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"By all accounts this should've been a disappointment, yet here we have a sequel that not only matches the quality of the original but, for me, even surpasses it.",8,26 November 2017,"What 'Trainspotting 2 (2017)' does so brilliantly is maintain a consistently dramatic thematic through-line that believably builds upon the fallout from the events that shaped the first film's ending. Each of its fantastically drawn characters deals with the past twenty years in very different but equally valid and expertly expressed ways. The belated sequel also stands head-and-shoulders above others of the kind in its inherent ability to deftly handle the references to its predecessor that come with the territory of such an endeavour. By amalgamating these callbacks into the very DNA of its story, the flick ultimately crafts a tale brimming with beautifully melancholic nostalgia, a heartbreaking yet stomach-twisting inevitability and the almost tangible sense of what might have been. Although it arguably, in some small ways, changes the essence of a couple of characters (Begbie in particular), the feature displays a remarkable understanding of its source material. It never makes a notable misstep, actually developing all its key players far more than they ever were in the original 'Trainspotting (1996)' and making them much more relatable in the process. Ultimately, it's a funny yet poignant piece which is more focused than its predecessor but still retains some of its occasionally eclectic hyperactivity, striking an impressive balance between the two differing styles to create what now seems like a highly logical and equally necessary continuation. As if all that weren't enough, it's also superbly directed, introducing an energetic visual splendour to its urban Scottish setting, and supremely entertaining. It's incredibly interesting and amazingly engaging. I actually think I may prefer this film to the first. 8/10.",T2 Trainspotting
19,bowmanblue,Lust for midlife crisis,10,19 February 2017,"There were few people more excited for a Trainspotting sequel than me. I was a mere eighteen-year-old film studies student when Renton first sprinted down the high street and was bundles over by security guards. It was no exaggeration to say that the film was part of my youth. But no sequel ever came. Rumours about spats between Ewan McGreggor and director Danny Boyle filled the internet and, despite a novel 'P*rno' having been written, it never materialised onto the big screen. Until now. It was excited in a way that was partly tinged with nerves – after all, how many sequels really even come close to the original? I was so pleased to see that this one does.Trainspotting 2 (or 'T2' as it's also called) is a true sequel. However, I can see that some people may not approve. It's the same and it's not. It follows the exploits of the main characters we saw the first time round, only (like me!) they're older, slower and not necessarily wiser. I've thought long and hard about how best to sum up Trainspotting 2 and I can only conclude that the first, starring youngsters as it did, was – as with all the youth – fast-paced, manic and hyper. Whereas, like us middle-aged Volvo drivers, Trainspotting 2 is a slower, more thoughtful affair, now not dealing with mad youthful exploits and, instead, concentrating on mid-life crisis and the regrets that come with looking back at your life.Trainspotting 2 is not Trainspotting. If you're expecting a re-run then you will definitely leave the cinema disappointed. What you have here is a 'what happened next' story. If you imagine the first Trainspotting as something like a 'war movie' i.e. it was an action-packed event with explosions everywhere. Then, if you were to make a film about the stars of this fictional war movie twenty years later, we wouldn't see the war/battles again. Instead, we'd see what happened to the soldiers when they returned home, left the army and their life as civilians. This is what you have here.Whether you love or loathe the sequel will depend on your expectations. I was ready for a new film and this is what I got. However, it also plays homage to its own source material and there are few sequels that have so many nods back to the original. Don't expect the same again, just expect awesome performances and slick direction from the surviving cast members. If I had to make one criticism, it would be about Ewan Bremner who played 'Spud' – he does come across as a little cartoonish. However, he's still as endearing as ever and, despite his character's failings, he does serve a purpose and the story wouldn't be the same without him.I haven't said much about what happens. That's because you shouldn't need to know how it all plays out to enjoy spending one last outing with these anti-heroes. This is the way sequels should be made. T2 is excellent (just like its Terminator sequel).",T2 Trainspotting
20,lesleyharris30,"A Very Fresh, Solid Sequel,",8,15 February 2017,"T2 Trainspotting is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. As far as sequels go, it is incredibly fresh, there is no sign of it trying to copy or mimic the original movie. It really does try and succeeds at being its own thing, Danny Boyle clearly had a vision for this movie and achieved it stupendously.I did find the nostalgia to be a bit too much. I have no problem with it being used and it was obviously necessary, but it was a bit too frequent, dwelling on the events of the first movie instead of trying to carry its own original story very often.The cast is what makes this movie. The four boys reprise their roles so effortlessly that you would not believe that its been twenty years since they stepped in to the shoes of Renton, Begbie, Spud and Simon. They apply growth to their characters, not simply mimicking what they did in the original, it is truly believable.It's a rare sequel that stands on its own and has a fresh, interesting plot. Well acted, directed and written, T2 Trainspotting is definitely worth the watch for fans of the original and anyone looking for a good drama. Renton returns home to reunite with the people he let down 20 years ago. Best Performance: Ewan McGregor",T2 Trainspotting
21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,18 June 2017,"T2 TrainspottingYou can always tell someone is an ex-junkie by the way they always chew on a hypodermic.Not as easy as smoking, the former users in this comedy did quit heroinfor a while.Returning to Edinburgh 20-years after fleeing with cash he and his mates scored in a heroin deal, Renton (Ewan McGregor) reconnects with the one least likely to kill him (Ewen Bremner) first.Violent encounters with Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) come afterwards. Following the reunion, the foursome work on a plan to secure a business loan for a brothel. But some seek to settle old debits.This sequel to the 1996 cult classic finds the same cast and director, Danny Boyle, returning for a second hit. Unfortunately, that entails removing everything pleasurable about the first and injecting the characters with boring 21-century cynicism. Ironically, with today's safe injection sites, heroin use is practically encouraged. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",T2 Trainspotting
22,Bored_Dragon,Overrated and unneeded,6,28 February 2018,"I have the impression that the crew of the original ""Trainspotting"" movie wasted all their money on heroin, so they hyped comeback to take more money on the old glory and fan's nostalgia. I can not say it's bad, cause it's not, but compared to first one... in fact, it can not be compared to first one at all. Same actors under baton of same director bring same characters twenty years later. They are good characters and the acting is great, but neither the story nor the direction are not even to the knee of the original. It's worth a look, but I will never repeat it, unlike the first one in which you can enjoy countless times.6,5/10",T2 Trainspotting
23,The-Sarkologist,Revisiting the Past,6,26 February 2017,"I'm still in two minds about this film. In one sense it continued to demonstrate Boyle's brilliance as a film maker, and also answered a number of questions that were left unanswered from the first film, such as why it was called 'Trainspotting'. However in another sense I felt that the first film was complete in and of itself and really didn't need a sequel. However, after being impacted the way I was by the first film, and also being intrigued by the trailer (which also reminded me that I hadn't seen the first film) it went without saying that I was going to see this one. Mind you, I seem to be pretty hit and miss when it comes to predicting which films would be packed and which wouldn't, and a part of me expected that on this opening weekend I was going to be fighting for a ticket. Turned out that I wasn't.Anyway, as we know from the last film, it ends with Renton heading out of London carrying a bag containing twelve thousand pounds, and with Begby being arrested namely because he is smashing up the hotel. So, the question is raised, especially twenty years after the conclusion of the first film, is what happened to them. Honestly, I really don't think it is a story that needs to be told, and a part of me was not actually expecting all that much when it came to this film. However, it turned out that I was actually quite surprised – T2 actually goes a lot further than simply 'what happened to them'.In a way T2 is more about the past as well as the future – rather than simply showing us what happened to them we also go back in time to see where they came from. In sense, the first movie introduced us to a group a junkies, and all we saw them was as junkies. Okay, much of the film was about Renton attempting to shake his habit, but in other ways we didn't see much beyond their immediate lives. I guess this is the key to both films – when they are junkies there is nothing beyond the immediate now, and nothing beyond that next hit. In a way there is no past, and the future is only as much as it takes to get high – existence is meaningless.Twenty years later and suddenly we are in a different world. Another aspect of the original film was that Renton couldn't escape the habit because he couldn't escape his friends, and the only way he escaped the habit was not just through some tough love by his parents, but also eventually walking away from those friends. Now we see a different Renton, a Renton who has returned to Edingburgh not just to seek out the past, and to look for a new future. In a way what the film seems to do is to flesh the characters out a lot more so they actually become real people as opposed to just junkies.Another thing that jumped out at me was how time passes. In a sense twenty years has passed and each of the characters seemed to have completely missed those twenty years. Renton was in Amsterdam, Spud was, and still is, a Junkie, and Begby is in Gaol. The only person that seems to have done something is Sickboy, though his life seems to revolve around scrapping whatever money he can get together to support a rather expensive cocaine addiction. In a sense life has suddenly passed them all by – sure, Renton may have chosen life, and it was a life that needed to be lived outside of Edinburgh.However, it is interesting how we look at the nature of addiction – everybody is addicted to something, and as Renton tells Spud, to get off the heroin one needs something to replace it, and what he does is that he replaces it by becoming a fitness junky. Sure, back in the day they spoke about choosing life, yet looking at the world twenty years on, that life that one chooses seems to be little different from the life of the heroin addict where we spend our lives trying to get our hands on whatever money we can to make our lives as comfortable as possible, yet realising in the end that this life we are pursuing is just as empty as that of the Junkies.",T2 Trainspotting
24,Reno-Rangan,To face a revenge threat!,5,24 August 2017,"Okay the first film was good one. Then I thought it was unnecessary to make a sequel for it. But someone clarified that it was not made outside the novel to make money. It's indeed adapted from the sequel book of the original film's source. Though coming out 20 years later was the disadvantage. Except some praises it had received, particularly by its hardcore fans, it was average at the box office and I thought same as well.I did not like the story. It was just a random drag, not knowing what direction to head. That's until the third act, and once all the three main characters come together, so it gets interesting with something. Like surviving from from a revenge threat. It was the actors who saved the film. Otherwise, it is not even an average as I consider now. I don't think retaining the title was a good idea, but I think it was just for its fans. Or else, a new title name would have done a decent justice to what it had narrated.As I know, this is the director's first ever sequel and he's not getting better since his Oscar win, a decade ago. Especially the last two flicks, despite based on the very good subjects. Definitely no to the T3. Instead, I want another Oscar nod film from him. This would have been ever worse if somebody else would have made it. Yet, a watchable film, only if you had liked the first. So just think about it before going for it after seeing only positive words from a few people.5/10",T2 Trainspotting
25,tomgillespie2002,A welcome send-off to a beloved ensemble of characters,6,29 May 2017,"As we are frequently reminded during the course of T2, it's been 20 years since Danny Boyle's iconic and culturally eye-opening Trainspotting. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his cronies, in a monologue no doubt quotable to anybody who was a teenager in 1996, famously decided not to choose life, and instead were on course for a wasted existence of heroin addiction and crime. The main question asked by this sequel is: Was it worth it? The group fans were so eager to see back together may have less hair and more body fat, but they have finally put aside personal squabbles (McGregor and Boyle made up after the former was overlooked in favour of Leonard Di Caprio for The Beach) and worked around ongoing contracts to reunite. While T2 struggles to find a consistent tone and somewhat falls apart during its final act, it will no doubt put a smile on any fan's face.The fragility of male machismo and the sudden emergence of middle- age are key themes running throughout the film, constantly harking back and reminding the audience with sly nods of how much fun these guys were 20 years ago. Trainspotting began with a skinny, pale- faced Renton running from store security, but here he runs dead-eyed on a treadmill. Although it would seem that Renton successfully put himself on the straight-and-narrow in Amsterdam after robbing his friends blind at the climax of the first film, he finds himself compelled to visit his past after suffering a medical scare. Returning to Edinburgh, not much has changed. Simon, aka Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), is still running scams, now with his Bulgarian 'girlfriend' Veronica (Anjela Nedyalkova); Spud (Ewen Bremner) lives alone and is hated by his embarrassed son, successfully getting himself off heroin before making his way back to it; and the psychopathic Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is behind bars serving a 25 year jail term.Irvine Welsh's sequel to the hit novel, Porno, has been talked about as a film adaptation ever since the first film struck so many chords with its audience. T2 is not this adaptation, but instead takes inspiration from Porno, as well as unused material from its predecessor, to create an original story. A straight-forward follow- up would not have done the fans justice. The cultural impact was so significant that Trainspotting played a big part in many young people's lives, to the point where just to hear the opening few seconds of Lou Reed's Perfect Day or Underworld's Born Slippy could transport any 30-40 year old back to their youth. Boyle knows this, and teases us in a scene where Renton re-visits his childhood home and fiddles with a record player. The stomping drums of Iggy Pop's Lust for Life pumps out before he suddenly takes the needle off the record. In that split second, the excitement comes flooding back. Yet T2 isn't just a trip down nostalgia lane, it confronts you with the difficult question of whether or not you are where you thought you'd be when life seemed more care-free.Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle infuses the sequel with a modern energy, opting for a more colourful palette made dirtier with digital grain. It contrasts the films' two different styles by slotting in actual scenes from the original, often juxtaposing events happening now with the characters' memories. The main conflict revolves around Begbie's escape from prison and his learning of Renton's reemergence in Edinburgh, as well as Sick Boy's resentment of his former best friend robbing him of his share in the drug deal gone right. Begbie uneasily shifts between comic relief and genuine antagonist, and Boyle seems unsure what to do with the character. The biggest revelation is Bremner's Spud, who is still the most sympathetic reprobate ever to emerge from Welsh's text. Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge ingeniously find a way to make him front and centre, turning this into his story, and Bremner's performance is truly heartbreaking. A mishandled climax and a lack of development for Veronica means that T2 falls way short of its predecessor, and this will perhaps not have the same impact on any audience members who saw Trainspotting outside of the '90s. But for those of us who did, this is a welcome send-off.",T2 Trainspotting
26,TheMovieDiorama,Trainspotting 2 is a competent and nostalgic fuelled sequel that feels slightly underwhelming.,7,25 February 2018,"Having only watch the original for the first time this year, it's safe to say I'm not part of the cult following. Having said that, I really enjoyed it for its bold and provocative portrayal of drug consumption. The characters were memorable, direction solid, hilarious moments...fortunately the sequel maintains that. Twenty years on after the betrayal in the first film, Renton returns back to Edinburgh where Sick Boy, Spud and a revenge driven Begbie wait for him. Wanting to start a business, replenish lost friendships and relive the past. Trainspotting 2 really does depend on nostalgic flashbacks, that is both a positive and a criticism. To start with though, Danny Boyle yet again directs an entertaining flick. A big fan of his directing, his contemporary camera technique (tilted angles, freeze frame transitions etc.) really suits the urban style that he is attempting to convey. A zany mixture between a Hollywood film and a British TV show, yet it works. Fortunately, he retained the same aesthetics from the first film. Flashy onscreen effects, zoomed in shots of drugs to intensify the scene and a dance/trance soundtrack. Underworld's ""Born Slippy"" is embedded within the soundtrack to highlight the nostalgia even more. The characters are as memorable as ever. Renton is filled with regret, Sick Boy is fuelled by hatred, Begbie just wants revenge and Spud...well he is just loveable. Incomprehensible, but loveable. All four leads were consistently great and found their performances to be entrancing. Why then, when the credits rolled, did I feel slightly underwhelmed? The constant hold and embrace of nostalgia deters from the current story. Clearly harking back to a more memorable and prolific film in an attempt to enhance this sequel, but if anything it just made me want to watch its predecessor again. Flashbacks are fine, but when it is constant it just feels jarring and tedious. This certainly isn't as hard hitting and controversial either, its tame approach may put people off.",T2 Trainspotting
27,Tweetienator,Boyle did Better Stuff,4,21 May 2017,"The main question left for me after watching T2 - why Mr. Boyle did bother to make this movie at all!? Well, I don't hate T2 but I don't love it either. More or less the whole movie left me indifferent and slightly bored. To sum it up: T2 felt to me like the Star Wars franchise - technically superb but without the reminiscence to the old trilogy (respectively T1) there is not much left. T2 is not really bad but no new cvlt and imho too mediocre to bother a lot about it. Maybe T3 will play in a retirement home and the old guys are waiting happy to get their dose of anti-depressants and the highlight of the day is how many times the guys are able to pinch the butts of young nurses. This could be a more interesting extension of the series. If you care to watch you will not die of boredom, but you won't see a masterpiece either. Trainspotting I will rewatch again, T2!? No need for it.",T2 Trainspotting
28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Nowhere near as special as the original, but a thoughtful return to these characters",7,2 July 2017,"Not all movie characters are worth revisiting 20 years later, but somehow it seems fitting to check in on Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) from Danny Boyle's exceptional indie film ""Trainspotting"" based on the book by Irvine Welsh. Watching their characters navigate their drug addiction to find meaning in life had a surprising resonance to it in the '90s and it only makes sense to see how they made out in a world that's changed a lot in two decades.""Trainspotting"" adapter John Hodge pens this reunion using some material from Welsh's follow-up book, ""Porno"" though the story is mostly original. Renton — going exclusively by Mark these days — returns to Edinburgh for the first time since betraying his friends and leaving the country. He encounters Spud, who is still struggling with addiction, while struggle to do right by his wife and kid and eventually Sick Boy – going exclusively by Simon — who is still living on the edge and running a pub as well as something of a blackmail operation with his girlfriend/partner, Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova). The two confront their feelings after all these years, while in the meantime, Begbie escapes from prison, still a slave to his anger.A lot of ""T2 Trainspotting"" wrestles with unresolved issues directly resulting from the first film's ending. Anyone unfamiliar with the original will find the entire exercise of this movie pointless as a result. Boyle and Hodge are most interested in having the characters come to terms with their past choices and how those choices have affected the current state of their lives. None of them are happy, even Mark, who seemed to have figured a way out of the junkie life. Otherwise, why would he return to Scotland?As a character study following up on these character, ""T2"" is fairly profound and interesting. Hodge and Boyle each contribute to moments of nostalgic reflection (the present day action takes the group back to old locations from the original, for example) and we end up feeling rather invested in the characters righting their personal ships this time around. The themes are mature and complex, even amidst some of the newly created hijinks, like when Mark and Simon go to a loyalist pub to steal debit cards and end up on stage for a song.On the whole, however, ""T2"" doesn't have the same verve as its original, edgy and subversive predecessor. Boyle employees a lot of similar technique in the editing to recreate the original's rhythm, but it comes off more as being done out of necessity and homage than enhancing the elements of the sequel's story. There are moments with clever technique, but the ingenuity and imagination — the energy, really — of ""Trainspotting"" isn't there this time around. So the real value of this sequel comes in revisiting characters and connecting with their modern-day struggles.That said, ""T2"" doesn't fail in the way that many sequels and reunion films do. When those films are being made, the thinking tends to be ""what story or series of plot mechanics would bring these people back together to do something with similar entertainment value to the last time?"" ""T2"" answers those questions but the film doesn't seem overly concerned with them. The plot is not the driving force of the movie, but rather the sum of where all the main characters' personal stories have led them (with the helpful convenience of Begbie escaping prison at the exact time Mark has returned to Scotland).If nothing else, ""T2 Trainspotting"" offers some closure. It provides a rare opportunity to see film characters grapple with the evolution and impact of their problems at one point of their lives at a later point in their lives. So often sequels introduce new problems that ignore the past, but ""T2"" takes a holistic approach. People who loved ""Trainspotting"" for the style rather than the characters will surely be let down to some extent, but most fans of that film will at least find that the making of this sequel was justified.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Is this one better than the first? No, of course, not. But what were you expecting, as the bar was set high with the original being such a sharp and punchy masterpiece. This however is a great sequel, where the time span pays off, a sequel, well worth the wait. This is a kind of more serious film, mainly due to the murderous intentions of an escaped and enraged Begbie, someone you don't wanna give bad news to. There are some things that make this one better than the first, but what I really like about this one, is that it's a different kind of movie, from the 96 original. The catalyst has Renton returning, to a revamped and toury Edinburgh to face the music, as just learning the passing of his mother, ""who in her own right, like her son, was also a drug addict"", or is it, that's it's just time, which as I understand it, is more the latter reason. He doesn't receive a warm welcome, obviously, and that's from all his mates. Sick Boy, who now owns a pub, is still profiting from his illegal and productive exploits, where he's graduated to much higher criminal, and dangerous activities. He's in cahoots with his hottie, Slovakian girlfriend, who runs sex blackmailing schemes. Their latest venture, where they bring in a new party (Guess who?) involves turning his pub into a bordello, this watering hole's facade, at night, beautifully shot as if in the middle of nowhere. This scam attracts the dangerous attention of a competing enterprise. Spud has just descended to a rock bottom and a pathetic existence, where Renton's return could just be his savior. Kelly Mcdonald, aka Diane is only in one scene, and is now, would you believe, a lawyer, who tries to fix up a mess, Sick Boy, has landed himself in, at the request of Renton. I'll be honest, I liked this film more than the original, very much in the admirable fact, it's different from the first, the whole show, not falling into repetition as if similar or clone bits from two Tarantino films, etc. Even if you haven't seen the first, you'll still like this one. The older actors deliver and retain their roles wonderfully, heralded of course, by the great McGregor. From it's treadmill slipping opening to it's ending of Renton's room tunnel shot, strobing ensuing, this is a fresh and originally exciting piece of work, of course nowhere near potent as the first. But the message delivered here, modestly throughout, is that of forgiveness, a moral which has been depicted many times in movies, despite an adverse Begbie with an insistence to kill, and who we also learn has a family. A few less freeze frame shots, wouldn't of hurt, coming across as stupid, and sometimes, disruptive.",T2 Trainspotting
31,paul-allaer,"""Hello Mark, so whatcha been up to... for 20 years?""",7,25 March 2017,"""T2 Trainspotting"" (2017 release; 117 min.) is a sequel to the landmark 1996 film ""Trainspotting"". As the movie opens, we gradually reconnect with the original cast and characters: Mark returns to Edinburgh, having lived in Amsterdam these past 20 years but now facing a failed marriage; Simon is getting by as a blackmailer, with the help of his Bulgarian girlfriend (or is she?); Spud lost his job due to missing the Daylight Savings Time change; and last but certainly not least, there is Franco, who learns his request for early release from prison is once again denied and now is determined to do whatever it takes to get out. And thus the wheels are set in motion... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this sequel reunites director Danny Boyle with the original cast members Ewan McGregor (as Mark), Ewen Bremner (as Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (as Simon) and Robert Carlyle (as Franco), taking stock of what has become of life 20 years later. When doing a sequel to such a landmark movie, the question of course is: why? What compelling reason is there to revisit these deeply flawed yet somehow endearing characters? The honest answer seems to be that there is no true compelling reason, other than to simply see what these characters have become. It takes quite a while for the movie to find a driving story line (revenge of some sort against Mark for having taken off with the £16,000 at the end of the first movie), but more importantly to reflect on the fact that 20 years have gone by, just like that. When Mark first reconnects with best bud Simon, he sneers ""Hello Mark, so whatcha been up to... for 20 years?"", ha! Mark is now 46, not 26. The movie flashes back to the original on a number of occasions, leading someone to comment to Mark ""You're a tourist in your own youth"". The movie is of course set in and around Edinburgh and feels like an ode to the city (when Mark first returns, he cannot believe all of the changes to the city since he was there 20 years ago). Beware: the characters speak in full-blown Scottish accents, and I must admit that on multiple occasions, entire sentences passed by over my head as I couldn't make out head or tails. Like the original, the movie's photography is pure eye-candy, and there iare tons of great song placements (most prominently: Blondie's ""Dreaming"" and Queen's ""Radio Gaga""), and it won't surprise you when I tell you that it all culminates with, of course, Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"" (in a new mix, and playing over the end credits).""T2 Trainspotting"" opened this weekend on 2 screens at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally, much to my surprise (less than 10 people in a large auditorium). Maybe my sense of anticipation (which was huge) was out of line with the general public's. If you loved the first one, you won't be disappointed with this sequel/reunion, although truth be told, neither does it bring anything anything new as such. Just watch it for the great performances.",T2 Trainspotting
32,subxerogravity,"It was OK, If you're looking for it to be more than that, too bad.",7,18 March 2017,"It's an OK movie. Don't really need to see the first one to like the second one, as it's about four people reconnecting with each other after twenty years, and most of the story's content is like that. Although, most of the plot does revolve around what happen in the original movie and is implemented with the idea that you did see the first one as Mark stupidly returns to his old stomping grounds knowing he stole money from his ""mates""(As they say across the pond) and you can only imagine what happen afterwards.The Franco character was the most interesting to catch up with. Despite spending most of his time in jail since the last movie, he seemed to have the most interesting situation to come back to, with a wife who did not truly miss him and a son who's becoming a man far different than the one he is as Franco has the same mentality he had when he got locked up, that no longer fits.When we last left Mark, it seemed like he was going to do something more with his life, but as it turned out that was not the case as he has some what of a mid-life crisis when he realized his life sucks.While Sick Boy (Now preferring Simon) and Spud seem to be stuck where they were Twenty Years ago (It happens, especially when drugs are in the mix).T2 does not seem as lively as the originally, but in many ways this makes perfect sense, as the movie is all about getting older, and the type of person you are in your Twenties vs. who your are later in life.It has it's amusing moments, but it does make me question weather Danny Boyle made this sequel simply for nostalgia reasons. He does not seem like that type of filmmaker, yet this movie falls into the great sequel trap as I felt not enough has changed in the past twenty years and I was expecting more.Although I did like how the film making was done to reflected how these characters have not changed. Using a lot of camera angles and other tricks Boyle did in the very first movie.I like the first movie, but not that much to really care about T2, but it did make me wonder what would happen next to these guys. For those of you who did love the original that much, I think you are in for a little bit of a let down.http://cinemagardens.com",T2 Trainspotting
33,jtindahouse,Less dark than the original but equally brilliant,8,10 December 2018,"The original 'Trainspotting' is one of the darkest movies I've ever seen. It's not for the faint hearted, however it is an incredible film there's no doubt about that. A sequel being released over 20 years later is a bold move, but in the case of 'Trainspotting' it's one that I absolutely love because there was certainly more story to be told about these characters.I would venture to say 'T2 Trainspotting' is less dark and more funny than the original. It certainly does have some dark elements to it, but for the most part things are a lot less grim. It's a very clever film too. The humour is very subtle in a lot of instances (you'd rarely find an American film made like this in that respect) but when you click on to what is being implied it is quite hilarious. Also I love the concept of 'Spud' potentially being the author of the novel. That is bloody genius it has to be said.All the actors are again in incredible form too. Robert Carlyle is particularly magnificent (although you almost need subtitles for his character at times as his accent is incredible heavy). The direction from Danny Boyle is also a thing of beauty. It's a great looking film from start to finish and every scene is laid out masterfully. I had a truly great time with 'T2 Trainspotting' and I think most people that watch it will too. A definite must-see film.",T2 Trainspotting
34,RodrigAndrisan,The film is good,8,3 February 2017,"The story is not extraordinary but the acting is first class. In fact, everything seems realistic, as in life. Except those dream scenes which are intertwined in an inspired way with what appears to be reality. Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Ewen Bremner and Jonny Lee Miller are all four very good. Anjela Nedyalkova in the role of Veronika is a very pleasant surprise, young, fresh, beautiful and talented Bulgarian lady. The soundtrack is the music that I like too, especially BLONDIE and QUEEN. Well, I would have used some JIMI HENDRIX, IAN DURY, PINK FLOYD, ROLLING STONES, OZRIC TENTACLES, WEATHER REPORT too. To be understood better, the first film has to be seen (or to be seen again).",T2 Trainspotting
35,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,30 August 2018,"OK...it may be bias, Trainspotting was one of my favorite movies, and one of the better, if frustrating, books I experienced in High School.And, I really want to avoid any hints towards the plot as....it might kill a lot of the humor for those that haven't seen it. So excuse the vagueness, but after watching it, you might see where its necessary from an entertainment not a twist standpoint.So...the bad: It is NOT ""Porno"" which breaks the heart because, well, ""Porno"" was absolutely hysterical, right down to why it had its title.That being said, the draw is the cast. Trainspotting was one of those ""how the hell did they make this book into a coherent movie"" movies and in many aspects ""Porno"" would have been easier, but would certainly still fit into that mold. So it's likely better that T2 didn't follow the book.Anyway, the joy is just seeing the crew back together again, the chemistry is still there, it's totally an ensemble cast and that was really the principal draw to the first film as well. I don't want to give away the plot, but the cast just works so well together, they know their characters and live them. And the characters are delightful to watch.I sort of feel that they could have thrown any script at them, and so long as the cast and characters stayed the same...the film would have been thoroughly entertaining. It doesn't hit as hard as the first film, but everyone has aged and it's still....brilliant.Really, you're watching it for the cast and characters, and it pays off in sheer entertainment.",T2 Trainspotting
36,Stevieboy666,Overdue sequel that doesn't quite deliver,6,20 May 2018,"Trainspotting was one of the best films of the 1990's, as a party loving 20 something at the time there were so many things about it that I could relate to (not heroin though!). And it was a film crying out for a sequel, what happened to those characters? Well two decades on and we find out.
I never for a moment expected this to be on par with the original. And it isn't. This may sound harsh but I felt that A-lister McGregor just went through the motions, even the great Robert Carlyle wasn't the Begbie of the original. The soundtrack of the original was fantastic, the same can't be said for the sequel. There are a few funny moments here but again they can't compete.
Like so many people I have waited a long time for this film and it's quite good, but also somewhat disappointing. I could watch the original over and over but doubt that I'd give T2 a second viewing.",T2 Trainspotting
37,alindsay-al,A great sequel,8,11 February 2017,"After having recently gone back and watching trainspotting recently I was really excited for this film, and I really enjoyed it. The premise is after 20 years Mark Renton returns home to Scotland where his three former friends simon, spud and begbie are waiting for him. Ewan McGregor returns to the role of renton seamlessly, he plays him so well that you believe he is really just playing himself. His chemistry with the rest of the cast was great and I really enjoyed watching his character. Jonny lee miller plays simon in this film and he is great, his relationship with mark really develops in interesting ways in this film and I found him to be a very good character. Ewan Bremmer plays spud and at first I did question why they bothered to bring him back as his character isn't really involved that much. But as the film progresses he becomes much more important and you do care about the lovable spud, he is the most innocent of the group so you automatically feel a bit sorry for him. But the best part of this film is Robert carlyle returning as begbie, he is even crazier in this film then he was in the first if possible. He is so funny to watch on screen that you love to hate him, but at at a point you do kind of somehow sympathise with him in this film. I also liked the addition of the character of veronica who was a great new character for this film. The story of this film has a nice progression from the last one, it is good to see all of the characters affected by the events of the last film. I also liked some of the narrative hear mainly that come from the first film involving the whole group. However, my main issue of the film is that there are way too many story arcs going on and the fact is some of them aren't even resolved by the end of the film which really bugs you. The script is great with some really funny real dialogue that makes these characters fun to watch and feel real. Also when the dramatic dialogue is needed it works for me. The style of the film is very unique and outlandish like the first one but it works. You see these characters situation and it makes sense some of the situations they are in. But I feel like I mentioned before there is a good 20 minutes that could be cut from the movie and it would really help the movie. Overall this is a great follow up from the original film and if you were a fan of that you definitely should see this film.",T2 Trainspotting

39,kirbylee70-599-526179,20 Years Later,9,15 August 2017,"Believe it or not it's been 20 years since the movie TRAINSPOTTING unleased itself upon the movie going public. At the time the movie was one of the most talked about films of the period. And yet you rarely hear anyone talk about it since then. It was controversial, it was upsetting and it was one of the first major films director Danny Boyle made. Since then he has gone on to direct SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, 127 HOURS, 28 DAYS LATER and STEVE JOBS. The actors involved have gone on to bigger and better things as well. And now, 20 years later, they have all reunited to tell the continuing story or this group.If you missed the first film or know nothing of it, it told the story of Marc Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his friends, a group of heroin junkies bent on crime. Included in the mix were his best friend Simon ""Sick Boy"" (Johnny Lee Miller), waste head Spud (Ewen Bremmer) and the ultra-violent Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Their drug fueled antics and hallucinations are the stuff nightmares are made of. By the end of the film the gang had stolen a load of money that Renton took off with, leaving only a portion for Spud.T2: TRAINSPOTTING has Marc returning home. His mother has passed away leaving his father home alone. He meets up with Spud as Spud has gone off the wagon again. Marc tells him he needs something to switch his addiction to, something like running or boxing, just something else to focus on. He then sets out to meet with Simon.Their reunion goes pretty much as one would expect at the end of the first film. Fist fly, bottles are broken and curses are exchanged. Simon was left behind with nothing and now owns the pub his mother owned falling on hard times since the area has degraded. On the side along with his girlfriend he tapes well to do men with her in an adjoining motel room and then threatens them with blackmail. The two seem to make up and Marc reveals he is back home after living in Amsterdam after failing at marriage and with a job ending there. But Simon has other plans. Still holding a grudge he sets in motion a plan to have his revenge on Marc.As all of this is unfolding Begbie sits in prison, meeting with his attorney in the hopes of getting parole. When it is denied, he escapes and heads home. He recruits his son, now in his late teens and attending college, to help him in a burglary. His view is that the boy should be following in his footsteps and setting aside dreams of school.Begbie eventually runs into Simon which Simon uses to his advantage. He lets him know that Marc is back in town, telling him he'll make sure he gets his chance at him. In truth, Simon is playing one against the other. On Marc's end, he recruits him to help change the pub into a brothel, something that helps Spud as well since he seems to be a natural decorator and assists the reconstruction.As with the first film the plans made by each and every one of these characters falls apart at one time or another. The question becomes will they be able to see past that indiscretions found in their history together or not? Will they forgive and forget or will plans of destruction fall through? And as the movie progresses, much like the first, you wonder just who if any of these friends will survive.To begin with Boyle has done an amazing job of pulling together all the elements needed to tell a story effectively and in an entertaining manner. Visually the movie is stunning at various times, a testament to Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. Moments in this film may stick with new recruits to the films like the first one did with a generation ago.All of the actors are at their best here, playing roles that were new to them 20 years ago as if they never left them behind. Each has gone on to so much more and yet here they are again. Interestingly enough in the extras a discussion among them with Boyle has McGregor talking about how he didn't know if he could be the same character again coming from Scotland since at the time of the first film he had only been away 3 years. Then he says he realized that much like he had been away so had his character.There will be moments that might offend some and certainly moments that will upset a few viewers. If you're willing to give this movie a chance you'll find that it has some hilarious moments (it is considered a dark comedy) and some touching moments as well. By the end you'll hope you're still around, and all involved as well, to see if they can carry on the story in another 10 or 20 years.",T2 Trainspotting
40,Kdosda_Hegen,What a great sequel.,8,9 May 2020,"While the original was all about the craziness and ""fun"", the sequel is a more serious approach to the story, characters grew up and now it's more of a drama, while still being a fun movie.",T2 Trainspotting
41,dierregi,Nostalgia is the past edited with only the good bits,7,2 July 2017,"Like some fans of the 1996 movie I feared the worst for this ""sequel"", but I was pleasantly surprised. Renton & co. have chosen life (Spud not so much, but he will change his mind) only to discover that middle age is not much fun.Being young - even as an addict - gives the feeling of the future wide open and endless possibilities. You can waste time trainspotting, and waste some more tomorrow. Then one day you wake up, you are 46 and not much time left to waste. Also, not much in terms of achievements. That is Mark's situation and his attempted cure is to be a tourist in his own youth.We travel with him and the experience is bittersweet. The only new character in the cast is a bit of a cliché, the smart Eastern European hooker Veronika, who likes all the boys and has a heart of gold (at least... for somebody). From a visual and musical point of view, no breathtaking surprises, but still a decent job. I just found disappointing to hear only some notes of the original music and a very nostalgic use of Blondie and Queen. The moral of the story? Younger generations are as ruthless and exploitative as the older ones, so be prepared to fight.",T2 Trainspotting
42,valleyjohn,Boyle unable to recreate Trainspotting vybe,6,26 May 2017,"I think Danny Boyle was on a hiding to nothing when he agreed to make a sequel to the iconic Trainspotting movie. How could he ever make it as exciting , edgy and original as the first movie? The answer to that is he couldn't. T2 catches up with the four ex ( or not) junkies 20 years later. Renton returns to Edinburgh after a long exile in Amsterdam, and he soon reunites with his old pals Sick Boy and Spud . As he tries to help Spud kick his heroin addiction and gets caught up in a scheme to open a brothel with Sick Boy, Renton is targeted by the sociopathic Begbie , who wants revenge for him stealing money off of him. I so wanted to love this film. I tried my hardest to get into it but it just wasn't happening. I'm not a fan of Ewan McGregor anyway . I think he lacks screen presence and it's is no different here . Ewen Bremner over does it with his exaggerated impression of Spud and it's annoying. Johnny Le Miller and Robert Carlyle are excellent and it's only when Begbie and Sick Boy are on the screen that I found myself enjoying it. There is one very funny scene when Renton and Sick Boy find themselves in a Loyalist social club and have to sing for their supper and it's a highlight of what is ultimately a disappointing follow up.",T2 Trainspotting

I enjoyed the reuniting parts along with the new material added in to keep up with the new generation with the late 90s vs the late 10s! It was interesting! I also liked the classic slogan from the first with the ""Choose Life"" line & how Renton mentioned Choose Facebook, Choose Twitter! I like that part! Begbie the psycho returns to get revenge on Renton all those years! It was a great reuniting film with a great new story- line! I think this sequel proves that even after 20 years, it still has the edge & dark twisted humour the gritty 96 version had!

45,valadas,A film of our time,6,5 March 2017,"Yes very modern in terms of society and experience. You must have seen Trainspotting one to understand this movie. I haven't seen it (yet) but I know the story. Mark Renton, after being cured of drug addiction emigrated to Amsterdam where he got a normal job and led a honest life. He returns now to Edimburgh and outskirts after many years and meets there again his old friends of drugs and delinquency. Their welcome is however a mixture of cordiality and hostility sometimes very violent with hard aggressions because he had run away with all the money obtained through a robbery by the four of them and that should have been divided among them. This story is formally and technically well told by a series of images and sequences in a overwhelming succession with sudden cuts and frequent flashbacks intermingled with the current story that sometimes are not quite explained or understood and mostly with the intention of introducing a bit of sentiment in that violent universe. In fact most scenes are characterized by extreme physical violence and hard core language.

47,Troy_Campbell,Choose belated sequels. Choose returning cast and crew. Choose T2.,7,24 February 2017,"Choose Life. Choose a sequel arriving 21 years after the original. Choose returning cast members now in their mid forties. Choose an Oscar winning director returning to his roots. Choose energy, flair and big brass balls. Having toyed with the idea of a follow-up ever since Trainspotting spoke to an entire generation of disenfranchised youth through drugs, anti-materialism and just not giving a crap, filmmaker Danny Boyle waited over two decades to round up the gang and see if they could recapture the magic. Considering the classic status afforded the original—thanks in large part to how well it holds up even today—the bar was probably too high to ever clear, but Boyle and co undoubtedly give it one hell of a shake. Centred on Mark Renton's (Ewan McGregor) return to Scotland after stealing a large amount of cash from his pals 20 odd years ago, we are slowly reintroduced to our core group of druggies, thieves and menaces to society. Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) has moved from heroin to cocaine, funding his habit through a blackmail scheme; Spud (Ewen Bremner) has lost his family thanks to his addiction to skag; Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is still a nutter, hell bent on getting revenge against Renton. There's a certain level of comfort hanging out with this band of familiar misfits and Boyle, fully aware of this fact, revels in their interactions; unfortunately this comes to the detriment of the plot, which is a rather flimsy commentary on regret, nostalgia and living in the past. Whilst there are no moments that'll stick in the memory like the baby hallucination or the toilet deep-dive from the original, Boyle still delivers a visceral, intense and hugely unpredictable experience like so few directors are capable of. There's a well-judged amount of snark rippling throughout too: social media, fitness centres, corporate desk jobs, reality TV and other modern day staples are all targeted, especially in the film's showcase 'Choose Life' monologue sprayed with gusto by McGregor. T2 Trainspotting falls short of besting its predecessor in both social and filmic relevance, yet the passion and ambition of all involved, plus an amazing soundtrack, ensure it's an exciting and engaging watch.",T2 Trainspotting
48,PimpinAinttEasy,Pure nostalgia .....,8,16 June 2017,"Revisiting some films and books are like meeting your old friends for a drink. So when Danny Boyle announced his sequel to Trainspotting (one of my favorite films and books), I was very eager to watch it.Mark Renton has a heart attack on a treadmill and decides to visit his old friends in Scotland. Spud is on the verge of suicide. Sick Boy is managing his old aunty's pub while blackmailing squares by shooting videos of their sexual escapades. He is also in love with a Bulgarian prostitute. Begbie escapes jail and comes to meet Sick Boy. The old crew is back, but they are older. Life is passing them by. They all get together for one final heist. But Begbie has other plans. The film did not disappoint. It has many poignant and laugh out loud scenes that are comparable to the original. There are also many nods to the first part. Parts of the film are almost like a music video. As the audience, you feel like standing up and dancing. The pulsating start with the joggers on the treadmill jogging to Shotgun Mouthwash, the scene at the pub with everyone singing along to Radio Ga Ga and Renton and Sick Boy's antics at the Protestant get together all remind you of the original.But there are many mediocre scenes as well. The final confrontation with Begbie was annoying and poorly written. At times, I got the impression that the film tried to overtly remind me of the first part. It is definitely a sequel that lives off the reputation of the first part. It does not stand very well on its own.All the actors are excellent. Though Robert Carlyle deserves special mention as the force of nature that is Francis Begbie. The soundtrack was also pretty good. Prodigy's remix of Iggy Pop's Lust for Life was very catchy.A couple of frames deserve special mention. The circular green light that shines on a bar table with a half drunk glass of beer. And the part where Renton is walking towards Sick Boy's pub and you get a view of the pub from the distance. I liked the lighting in that scene.",T2 Trainspotting
49,antoniotierno,Too much focused on the prequel,6,3 March 2017,"Boyle's film is addicted to its own nostalgia, or as one character calls it, ""being a tourist in your own youth."" For Renton, it's about going home; for Begbie, it's about revenge; for Sickboy, it's about being stuck in your aunt's old pub in a city hooked on '80s nostalgia nights while European subsidies and waves of gentrification obliterate the past. (To say nothing of the fact that the tourist board's girl-in-a-kilt at the airport saying, ""Welcome to Edinburgh"" is really from Slovenia.). There are some bravura Boyle moments, such as when Sickboy's apartment turns into a football stadium, or Spud's cold turkey finds Bremner (the best performer of the lot) silhouetted like Nosferatu on the peeling wall of his squalid council flat. Time has not diminished the director's love for a variety of shots and angles. However there's too much nostalgia and too much looking back..",T2 Trainspotting
50,maurice_yacowar,Addicted Scottish outsiders reconvene after 20 years.,8,4 April 2017,"Here's where Coleridge's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" kicks in. We have to believe the four ""heroes"" of Trainspotting survived for another 20 years. This film tells us they did so we have to accept that, however improbable that may be. If we don't there's no movie — and that would be a loss. The sequel is a rewarding, touching return to those four fascinating Scottish outsiders and their varying attempts to escape their drug addictions. T2 retains the original exuberant nihilism. Renton's exhortation parallels his first film's opening: Choose life. Choose Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and hope that someone, somewhere cares. Choose looking up old flames, wishing you'd done it all differently. And choose watching history repeat itself. Choose your future. Choose reality TV, slut shaming, revenge porn. Choose a zero-hour contract, a two hour journey to work. And choose the same for your kids, only worse, and smother the pain with an unknown dose of an unknown drug made in somebody's kitchen. And then... take a deep breath. You're an addict. So be addicted, just be addicted to something else. Choose the ones you love. Choose your future. Choose life.The plot centres on Renton's return and his three mates' response to him having run off with their drug deal money 20 years earlier. He had paid Spud, who blew it on heroin, but Sick Boy wants to score a deeper revenge than his cue-stick attack. Begbie escapes jail and tries to kill them all. Age has brought the three lads to hunger for a dignity that they don't have much chance ever to get. Sick Boy tries to move up from his seedy pimp-and-blackmail career to running a classy sauna-cum-brothel on an EU urban development grant — until a powerful pimp elbows him out. Renton is squeezed out of his London financial job and succeeds as a real estate agent until his old mates sink him. They can't leave their laddish ways easily. Begbie returns to his wife and grown son, who prefers his college ambitions over joining Dad in his work. Begbie's hunger for vengeance gets him back in jail. Spud has lost his wife and son to his heroin habit but by the end of the film seems on some road back. Sick Boy's woman Veronica encourages Spud to write out his colourful anecdotes in his speaking voice — which will turn into the successful Irvine Welsh novels on which the film were based. Renton survives.Memory is a key theme in the film. The past is an actual presence when Renton's mother's shadow appears behind the empty kitchen chair, on his return after her death. In another scene Spud moves unleashed from his shadow — or vice versa. The last shot turns Renton's boyhood bedroom into a continuously expanding tunnel from which we hurl away as if on a train, like the engines that fill the transporting boy's wallpaper. The flashbacks to the first film flesh out the characters' root in their past and struggle to emerge from it. When the men return to the highlands in memory of the dead Tommy, Sick Boy rejects the nostalgia: ""You're a tourist in your own youth. We were young; bad things happened."" Sick Boy can't escape his infant daughter's death any more than Spud his self- destructive addictions and Rentpn's nagging dream of normalcy. In contrast, the precocious schoolgirl of Renton's one-night stand has matured into a still insightful, expensive lawyer. But the four men have sadly failed to outgrow their old selves, though Renton has made the best stab at it. As Spud articulates their failures, ""First, there's an opportunity. Then... there's a betrayal."" Under Danny Boyle's direction this sequel takes advantage of the opportunity the first film and its ardent following provided — without betraying its values, spirit and energy. If the excremental vision is toned down slightly it's to salutary effect.",T2 Trainspotting
51,rockman182,T2 Trainspotting (2017),7,21 May 2017,"I wasn't always a fan of Danny Boyle's films until I saw Sunshine and he blew me away with what turned out to be one of my favorite space films. Then he came out with Slumdog which was generic trash but later redeemed himself with Steve Jobs (mostly due to a wonderful script by Aaron Sorkin). I unfortunately can't remember what I thought of the first Trainspotting so I didn't really look forward to the sequel although I would still check it out because I'll watch literally everything. After viewing the film I've got to say its quite good and I find myself wanting to go back to the original just to see which is superior.The film takes place 20 years after the incidents of the first film. Renton is trying to reunite and make amends with his old friends. Spud is down out of luck and suicidal. Sick Boy has set up a blackmailing business along with his prostitute girlfriend. And Begbie escapes prison and is out for revenge against Renton. Its quite easy to pick up on what's going on in the film even if you can't remember the first. This film would actually rank quite high in the filmography of Boyle.The film uses many callbacks to the first film in soundtrack, style and quite literally in the picture. The film utilizes flashbacks and transposing of incidents from the first film into the current frame. The film is un-apologetically fueled with crass language, sex drugs, and violence; its basically you would expect from the film. Its nice to see Robert Carlyle in something that's not that shitty Once Upon a Time show, he's a talented guy who should be in more good things.The film is entertaining from start to finish. The characters are great, memorable and unique in their own ways. There's a lack of Kelly Macdonald in the film but its all good since it thrives in other places. I think the finish of the film is nice, its a great tribute to the first film. I also really liked the entire scene with the updated ""choose life"" speech. I think if you're a fan of Trainspotting you'll be quite pleased with this product. The story has enough life for a third film even to cap off a trilogy.

Still, because drug use can have long-lasting effects, the Trainspotting sequel is an important part of the whole narrative.Unfortunately, as is the case with these types of sequels, the story didn't change at all. After all, if it worked once, what's to say it won't work again. T2 Trainspotting continues to glamorize the party lifestyle of sex, drugs, and rock and roll in a visual style that's fun to watch. Of course, what was a little interesting about this sequel is that it was almost self-aware of what it was: a hit of nostalgia. One of the most expensive and profitable drugs of our current society is nostalgia, and this film hits it right on the head. The occasional rants from these characters, Mark Renton's (Ewan McGregor) being the best of the set, turn a harsh light on a film industry that can't manage to do anything new.While the themes of drug recovery, rehab, and relapse are still present in this film, albeit, via different characters this time around, it's interesting how old habits can die hard. Some of the consequences of the first film played out a bit in this one, but overall it had the same ending. There were brief references to the outcomes of the drug lifestyle throughout this film, but nothing ever seemed that significant to these characters. They didn't care about abandoned children, broken marriages, or legal troubles. They only cared about their next high, be it from Viagara, adrenaline, or plain old cocaine.A self-aware and almost identical follow-up to a great film, I give T2 Trainspotting 3.5 stars out of 5.",T2 Trainspotting
53,rbrb,The 3 (4) Stooges meet The Naked Lunch,8,19 August 2017,This is a fabulous black comedy with a cutting edge of seriousness.It is a sequel to a famous original but can stand on its own even though some viewers may take a while to get into the rhythm of the picture.The story is about a group of loser drug addicts and their adventures and treacheries.Super acting.Great music.Funny and sad.8/10.,T2 Trainspotting
54,Ruskington,A watchable but totally unnecessary sequel,5,16 April 2020,"T2T starts off ok; the original cast look great, the Edinburgh landscape is perfectly atmospheric and the music is good (I mean it's not a patch on the original soundtrack but that would be close to impossible). There are plenty of great one-liners and some strong comedic acting from the adorable Ewen Bremner. Jonny Lee Miller and Ewan McGregor give solid performances and Robert Carlyle, while still a bit over-the-top, is just as intimidating and maniacal as he was 21 years before.Sadly though, it gets progressively worse as it goes along. The plot is weak, unimaginative and uninspiring. The acting starts out ok but gradually becomes cliched and melodramatic. The choppy editing and the insertion of social media graphics make it a bit of a visual headache and the soundtrack just seems like it's trying too hard to recreate the feel of the original. The Veronika character is a very convenient and totally unrealistic part of the story and just feels like lazy uninspired writing. The closing scenes with the trains flashing by in the background felt like they were produced by a Hitchcock-inspired college student. And as for the finale, it was about as predictable and unsubtle as it's possible to get.There are some logistical issues too. Does Spud, a junkie since the 90's who was so despondent about his addiction that he tried to take his own life, suddenly become clean overnight without much of a struggle simply because his old friend rocked up and took him out for a jog? Is it really that easy? It certainly didn't seem that way for Renton back in 1996. And how exactly does somebody escape from prison, go back to his family home and remain undetected for weeks on end? Where exactly where the police looking?Plot band-aids aside, the biggest issue for me was the constant referencing of the original movie. Trainspotting ended perfectly in my opinion; there was absolutely no need to tie up any loose ends or provide long-winded dialogue about how affected everyone was by what happened. Is £16,000 split four ways even that much money to be stressed out about? Would Begbie really have been stewing on it that much for so long and have murderous intentions?If I was watching this as a stand-alone film I probably wouldn't mind it that much. The setting and characters are very engaging and it's laugh-out-loud funny at times. But it's very difficult to separate it from the original and Trainspotting is an all-time classic of British cinema which now feels a tiny bit tainted.",T2 Trainspotting
55,joebloggscity,A Lust for Life remains for the old friends 20 years on,6,18 March 2017,"It's been a long wait for this, a sequel which few thought would be made. For those too young to have been around when the original came out, you can't really imagine the impact that the initial film had in many ways. On music, reading and films for the time, it was like a shot in the face, a wonderful time.Irvine Welsh had penned a sequel and prequel book but this film is nothing like either so this new film takes its own route. We have Renton returning back to Edinburgh, and finds that everything but nothing has really changed. Only Spud/Murphy is still a junkie, but his old friend Sickboy is still up to scams, and as for Begbie, well he's as hellbent on getting Renton as ever.This film isn't the same as before. The first film is really a commentary around the life of the gang stuck in a ruthole around heroin. This film though isn't centred around that. In some ways it's nothing like the original. The characters are the same but not the structure or struggles. Kind of feels a bit like ""Lock Stock"" style of writing.The film also is very referential to the first, to the point it felt like as if all they wished to do at some points was just reshow the original.Regardless, it's still a very fun movie, guess my expectations or hopes were too high. Couldn't have expected too much, but the characters bring back memories and they are as loathsome and lovable as always. The story is often predictable but you still go along with it.Settings were pure old school blue-collar Scotland, and the scene in the loyalists pub will have people in Scotland and Ulster laughing their heads off as they will understand that better than anyone else. It was classic.I enjoyed it. Doesn't dent the memory of the original, and builds on it but doesn't challenge it.Worth a watch if you very much enjoyed the first film. A fair follow-up.If they wish to do another one, and there is still is scope to do so, then I hope that this time they don't wait as long.",T2 Trainspotting
56,dave-mcclain,"""T2 Trainspotting"" is better plotted and more accessible than the original, but maintains the first film's rebellious spirit.",7,15 April 2017,"Danny Boyle has gotten the band back together! The director of the 1996 cult classic ""Trainspotting"" has again worked with that film's screenwriter, John Hodge (again working from the work of novelist Irvine Welsh), and reassembled the main cast members from that earlier film for ""T2 Trainspotting"" (R, 1:57), a sequel that was two decades in the making (in terms of the plot and the actual shooting). However, this script is mostly Hodge's original work, being only loosely based on Welsh's ""Porno"", his 2002 sequel to his 1993 novel ""Trainspotting"" (but the script also mines some material from that first book). Regarding the cast, Ewan McGregor is back as Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton, Ewen Bremner as Daniel ""Spud"" Murphy, Jonny Lee Miller as Simon ""Sick Boy"" Williamson and Robert Carlyle as Francis ""Franco"" Begbie, with James Cosmo and Kelly Macdonald appearing in two scenes each, respectively, as Mark's dad and Diane.Of course, over the previous 20 years, much happened in the lives of these characters – and the real people associated with the first movie. The original ""Trainspotting"" was only the second feature film directed by Boyle, but he went on to direct ""28 Days Later"", the Oscar-nominated ""127 Hours"" and he won the Best Director Oscar for the 2008 Best Picture Oscar winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"". After Hodge's Oscar nomination for his ""Trainspotting"" script, he continued to collaborate with Boyle (on ""A Life Less Ordinary"", ""The Beach"" and ""Trance""). The four main actors in the sequel were also each very early in their feature film careers in 1996, but have all racked up big accomplishments since. McGregor went on to star in over 50 more films, including ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Moulin Rouge!"", the ""Star Wars"" prequels and 2017's ""Beauty and the Beast"". Bremner has appeared in over 30 more feature films (including ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Pearl Harbor"") and numerous short films, TV movies and TV series. Miller has done over a dozen more films and several TV series, including ""Eli Stone"", ""Dexter"" and ""Elementary"". And last but certainly not least, Carlyle went on from ""Trainspotting"" to star in ""The Full Monty"", ""The World is Not Enough"", ""28 Weeks Later"", ""Barney"" and the TV series ""Once Upon a Time"". But, it's where these actors' ""Trainspotting"" characters went after 1996 that concerns us here, so The sequel opens similarly to how the original began – with Mark running – not through the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland, but on a treadmill in a gym in Amsterdam. That's where he settled after stealing all the money he and his friends got from pulling a job at the end of the last film. He is gainfully employed, he's married and he's heroin-free – and has been since he left Edinburgh. His former childhood friends aren't doing as well. Begbie is in prison until he finds out that he has been denied parole (again – due to his violent tendencies) and hatches an escape plan. Spud has been working off and on (construction and miscellaneous other jobs) and he has fathered a child, but the mother is trying to keep him away from their daughter due to his ongoing heroin habit. Spud just wants to see his little girl and her mother happy again – and to get clean, but is failing on both counts and has become suicidally depressed. Simon is running his deceased aunt's pub – and a sex/blackmail scam with his young Bulgarian girlfriend, Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova). Oh, and he's moved on from heroin to cocaine. Except for Spud, these guys may not be going by their childhood nicknames anymore, but grown up they definitely are not.Mark decides to come home (at least) for a visit and not everyone is happy to see him. Spud blames Mark for ruining his life. Mark tries to help Spud get clean and healthy, but that proves challenging. Mark visits Simon who feels the need to work out some aggression over that stolen money from so many years ago, but then Mark and Simon start hanging out and even talk about going into business together. Meanwhile, Begbie makes it home and reunites with his wife (Pauline Turner), with whom he finds he is unable to have sex) and his college-aged son (Scot Greenan), whom dear old dad is trying to pressure into joining him in a continuing life of crime. Begbie's family issues are causing him to be very frustrated and angry, but that's nothing compared to how he feels when he finds out that Simon knows where Mark is. Fans of the original film will remember that when Mark stole the gang's money, Spud was upset and Simon was furious, but it was Begbie who tore up a hotel room. Given that history, the moment when Mark and Begbie are once again face to face is very eagerly anticipated by the audience.""T2 Trainspotting"" is better plotted and more accessible than the original, but maintains the first film's rebellious spirit. The thick Scottish accents are still hard to understand, but Boyle gives us subtitles for the first couple scenes while our ears tune in. Also like in the first film, there are drugs, profane insults, scenes to make you gag and nudity (male and female), just less of each of those things. What this film has more of is anxiety – regrets about the past, difficulty adjusting to the present and deep concerns about the future. And the shared history of these four men is lurking in the background for all of them, as we see in the sets and scenery, flashback scenes (some from the first movie and some newly filmed), and especially in Mark's angry ""choose life"" monologue that he launches at Veronika. With all that, and filmmaking as creative as in the original, ""Trainspotting"" fans will likely be pleased and ""T2"" may even create a few more. ""B+""",T2 Trainspotting

58,tonypeacock-1,Sequel syndrome lessens the impact of this Trainspotting,7,28 February 2017,"I went to see this film with fond memories of the original Trainspotting film from 1996. A black comedy that focused on the Edinburgh drug culture that had a fantastic soundtrack and excellent performances from its main stars Ewan McGregor, Ewan Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle.T2 carries on the events some twenty years or so after the original film and the first act of the film is more nostalgia. Interesting and depressing at the same time as we see what has happened to the characters in those intervening years. Be it a custodial prison sentence, children, a new life abroad and detoxification, continued substance misuse and crime. We also see how Edinburgh itself has changed with the introduction of a new tram line through its main Princes Street core and the hideous looking Holyrood Scottish Parliament building.It is only as the film progresses that more 'comedy' elements liven up the dreary atmosphere of the nostalgia. A short George Best montage with the obligatory goal against Sheffield United raised a few chuckles. Where as the first film had a substance misuse backdrop the subject changes slightly to a pornography backdrop using elements of Irvine Walsh's 'Porno' book. The sequel to his original Trainspotting novel. Director Danny Boyle again successfully makes some quite dubious characters likable such as 'Spud' played by Ewen Bremner.The film like its predecessor has a good soundtrack including the John Barry 007 Theme and ties together many plot lines after many years. I would highly recommend watching the first film to have more of an understanding of some elements of the second. To watch it blindly would lessen its impact.",T2 Trainspotting
59,brankovranjkovic,T2 Trainspotting – British film making gets a shot in the arm (PUN),9,31 January 2017,"Directed by Danny Boyle, who also directed the original. The first film was released way back in 1996 and was the film that launched Ewan McGregor's career, this sequel has been made in the same vein (PUN). A Cert 18 has been awarded due to the violence, sex and especially drug content. The original cast are reunited and we get to see what has happened to the 4 lads, who in the original didn't care about their futures, who are now 20 years older and now men regretting their past.With plenty of references to the original film, this doesn't have the impact of the first film, but is still a very gritty emotional drama that very cleverly integrates some iconic flashback scenes from the first film. The most memorable scene for me was the Ewan McGregor 'Choose life' monologue scene (Brilliant!). Spud steals every scene he appears in. At various times we hear him quote lines he has scrawled on numerous dog-eared pads. ""First there was an opportunity, then there was a betrayal."" It turns out these scribbles are the basis for the first film (Genius!). The last 10-15 minutes becomes very dark, almost horror in its atmosphere. The occasional very strong Scottish accents might make it difficult to understand if viewed outside UK, however might also lead to an Oscar nomination for ""Best film in a foreign language"" category. (excuse my attempt at another PUN). This film would be appreciated if you're old enough to have seen the first film 20 years ago. Recommended.",T2 Trainspotting

62,joachimokeefe,The ultimate pop video,8,28 January 2017,"20-year reunion of the original characters (and cast). We last saw Renton (MacGregor) ripping off his mates for £12000, though he did leave £4k for Spud (Bremner). What's at stake, then? Divorced Renton returns to Edinburgh from Holland, and perhaps he shouldn't have. The main suspense consists in what will happen when Begsbie (Carlyle) catches up with him, though Sick Boy (Miller) has his own ideas for revenge.That's the plot, such as it is, and it's impressive how four characters are followed without the pace slacking. Danny Boyle's typical use of overt digital FX and strong musical sequences make T2 very easy to watch, and there's a good balance of action, tragedy and hilarity. If you don't know Scotland, you may not pick up on some of the acute observations, and i you're looking for ""I, Daniel Blake""-style social realism, you won't find much. T2 is a caricature, but an accurate one. A satisfying ending, and plenty of great sound and visuals.Feminist credentials not great, but it was always a lads' movie.

Now that I've seen her, I think, I'm not disappointed because I did not expect anything, but it could have been a pleasant surprise.The film only has something of interest, when it remembers moments of the first part. The rest of the film is entirely left over.It is not only that the script is bad, it is that it has nothing to tell. Of course, it is well prepared for the third part.The first part had a lot of hook. I had claw. The metaphors were very good and in addition, you saw things that were very strong and well carried. In this, it is like an evil substitute, who has no girl, who has no moments of interest.The actors are simply hanging out because they have to do the second part. There is no passion in them.Photography is nothing special.The management is incredibly unsuccessful. The planes are all crooked, the problem is that if you twist some, you give it strength, but if you twist all, you get bored. There is a moment even Ewan leaves the screen. He does not know that he has nothing to say and he is very bad at it.In addition, many planes end in pause and being too flat, boring and slow. It has many moments of effects that a film like that does not hit anything.

So that's where I'd leave it after the first hour, but this does get better, with some very nice scenes (well not 'nice' of course), but it still never quite shakes the nostalgia trip, with many of the characters feeling dialled in and bloated, especially Robert Carlyle's Begbie who is largely unwatchable compared to his visceral 90s portrayal. Ewan Bremner's Spud however really works being elevated from his bit part existence, but still this is a far cry from Boyle's first shot in the arm.",T2 Trainspotting

So it was with mixed feelings I was going to see the second film 20 years later, it better not be sheit, and it most definitely wasn't.This is a great film, that looks back to the former film and really carries the mood into the new life of Renton, Sick Boy/Simon, Spud, Begbie and more. This is a an older, more mature film in many ways and yet it still has a lot of scenes that is still the same old crazy gang worthy, stupid ideas, wild fights, all the feelings of a good bro-mantic comedy/drama (love, hate, anger, betrayal) to mention a few.If you saw Trainspotting back in the day and liked it, for whatever reason, the craziness, the weirdness, Edinburgh, what ever reason, this will take you back to the same place.

67,PyroSikTh,Not Sure Why They Bothered,6,29 January 2017,"I was quite excited to see what Boyle and the gang could deliver with a follow-up.Disappointment. Disappointment is what they delivered, if I'm honest. Let's just get this out the way first before I attempt to judge it on it's own merits; it just didn't feel like Trainspotting. Sure, all the characters are back, but Spud was the only one that really felt like the older version of his younger self. Renton is bland, uninteresting, and looks far too polished thanks to a now world-famous Ewan McGregor, Begbie's stint in jail seems to have robbed him of any sense of intimidation (ironically thanks to not being scrawny any more), and while Sick Boy's bleach-blonde hair and failed entrepreneurial mannerisms are still intact, he lacks the smarm from the first film (possibly forgivable considering the twenty years that have passed). Then there's the lack of narration, interspersed flashbacks, and a restraint in how much it actually decides to show, and it pretty much lacks any of the things that made the first film so revolutionary, and instead gives way to a much more traditional and Hollywood- polished film.But judged on it's own merits? The story is a little lacking, bar a few choice moments and sub-plots. The first act is entirely focused on showing where these guys have been for the last twenty years. Renton is back from Amsterdam with a wedding ring on his finger and a story of ill health, Sick Boy has been pimping out his girlfriend in order to blackmail wealthy individuals with a particular fetish that's not all that shocking by today's standards, Begbie's been couped in prison, and Spud lived a happy life with Gail and their son, until he lost everything thanks to British Summer Time and reverted back to the life of a junkie. It takes quite a while before they all band together; Renton, Sick Boy and Spud endeavour to create a ""sauna"" in a pub Sick Boy inherited, while Begbie is out for violent vengeance against Renton. As stories go, it's a little underwhelming, and ultimately boils down to spoiling the perfectly profound ending of the first film through over-explaining.It's not a complete failure though. Begbie's place in the story adds excitement and tension, and thankfully stays true to his character, but is ultimately a little superfluous and coincidental (he manages to break out of jail the same time Renton returns?). Spud's sub-plot is by far the most interesting, the most heart-felt, and the most powerful. He was a little pushed aside in the first film, but he welcomes a lot of great development the second time around.Humour-wise, again it has it's moments, but is otherwise a little underwhelming. Renton and Sick Boy's song about a conflict in 1690 is certainly an entertaining highlight, and many of Begbie's scenes are bathed in a cruel sense of light- heartedness, but in all I didn't find myself laughing all that much. Satirically it's lacking as well. It tries to poke fun at middle aged men in a modern world they don't fully understand, but it often feels like being whacked over the head with a 2x4. Renton's updated 'Choose Life' speech, for instance, lacks any resemblance of sarcasm or subtext and pretty much just spells it out for you.Musically it's a bit of a mixed bag, and I mean that literally. It attempts to strike a smooth balance between those iconic tracks of the movie twenty years ago, as well as injecting some music a little more modern. Iggy Pop's Lust for Life and Underworld's Born Slippy return, but not as you remember them; the former remixed by The Prodigy, and the latter slowed down and warped. For modern music there's a selection ranging from Wolf Alice to Young Fathers, and just to appeal to the older viewers and their nostalgia there's a heavy dose of Pet Shop Boys, Queen, and Blondie. Ultimately though, none of it is nearly as iconic or memorable as it wants to be. The modern tracks are bland and forgettable, and the old tracks are so overused they've drifted into cliché. Honestly, the remixes were the best part of the whole soundtrack, embodying the very notion of the old, modernised.T2 isn't a complete trainwreck. Judged on it's own merits it's a well-made film that tells an interesting, if slightly underwhelming tale of middle-aged men in a modern world they don't understand. The last twenty years haven't been kind to this group of friends, and the next twenty don't hold any promises either; ""He gave me thirty years. What am I supposed to do with thirty years? Two or three I could figure something out, but thirty?!"" At the end of the day, T2 can't decide if it wants to be it's own thing, or be a direct descendant of it's predecessor. It wants to break away with a new format and new sensibilities, but can't stop itself from pointing out the connections with blunt-force trauma. I give T2 Trainspotting a disappointingly average 6/10. If I ever watch it again, it'll purely be for Spud's sub-plot, which was actually brilliant.",T2 Trainspotting
68,Cinemaniac1984,Definitely well worth taking a trip on the nostalgia train after 21 years.,8,28 June 2017,"I wasn't so sure how T2 Trainspotting was going to turn out given that it's been 21 years since the first movie was released back in 1996. As it turns out, it was well worth bringing out a sequel to the iconic classic. The original quarter of Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle make a welcome return to their old roles.Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns Edinburgh, Scotland after he stole the money from his friends 20 years ago and is now making a living in Amsterdam. While back in Edinburgh, Renton decides to visit his old friends including Spud (Ewen Bremner) who is still struggling with his heroin addiction and his personal life is falling apart after he loses his job as a construction worker and is now estranged from his former wife Gail (Shirley Henderson) and son. Simon ""Sick Boy"" (Jonny Lee Miller) is running his late aunt's pub that is barely making money as well as dabbling in blackmailing men with his Bulgarian girlfriend Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova) by filming them in sex videos. Little do they know, Begbie (Robert Carlyle) has escaped from prison after having been there for the past 20 years and all of his applications for parole have been refused due to his violent behaviour.T2 Trainspotting explore what the quartet have been up to for the past 20 years. This film takes a trip down the path of nostalgia and you find out all the highs and lows that they all have been through. We are also treated to the ""Choose Life"" monologue that has been updated to fit into today's theme of modern technology. Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle do well revisiting their old roles. Ewan McGregor is always brilliant and shows that Renton somehow gets dragged back into his old life despite leaving it all behind many years ago. Ewen Bremner is a stand out by showing that deep down Spud still has a good heart despite the drug addled hardships that he has endured for a majority of his life. Robert Carlyle does no wrong as Begbie who is more unstable and violent and unsurprisingly deserves to be in prison. Jonny Lee Miller who is more well known as a charismatic leading man in many TV shows nowadays does well turning back the clock as the deceitful and selfish Sick Boy. Also returning in small roles include Kelly McDonald, James Cosmo and in small flashbacks Kevin McKidd and Eileen Nicholas.Danny Boyle is the only one that was instrumental in bringing back the old gang and is also the only one that could resurrect the spirit of the old movie. Here, he does this perfectly.I will admit that Trainspotting set the bar very high and it's not an easy task reaching the high standard that was set. T2 Trainspotting, while not a groundbreaking sequel, excellently hops onto the nostalgia train and picks up where the first movie left off. Many sequels go one better than the original movie, many do just fine revisiting old ground, and some crash and burn. T2 Trainspotting does very well as a sequel, and was well worth watching.8/10.",T2 Trainspotting

Danny Boyle's casting of Ewan McGregor as Renton sat extremely uncomfortably with his characterisation in Irvine Welsh's mind-blowing source novel. The stage adaptation that featured both Ewen Bremner and Susan Vidler was much more mind-blowing and credible than the movie.A public schoolboy from Creiff simply did not fit my vision of an, albeit relatively educated compared to his peers, junkie from West Granton.The low budget special effects were largely corny. The baby on the ceiling? Come on.The filthiest toilet in Scotland? With crystal clear water? Come on.But the music was outstanding and it clearly nailed a cultural moment (I hesitate to say zeitgeist).So, my expectations of a sequel, especially of a cult youth movie, twenty years on, were hardly sky high.They should have been, because in my view this is everything that Trainspotting was not.""Choose Life.

"" Renton's cynical rant in the original is a sardonic take on the AIDS campaign that fitted so perfectly with the drug addled HIV capital of Europe moniker that Edinburgh 'enjoyed' in the mid 1990's. The city's unique needle-sharing skag culture had contributed to a minor epidemic, and choosing life was not a decision, merely a potential outcome. This underclass had zero control. Zero choice. Only Renton (who at least had supportive parents) had the wherewithal to escape; not just from the vicious circle, but from the country itself. Set up with £12,000 of his mates' money, the proceeds of a London drug sale that he had, admittedly, part funded (That gets overlooked and is a slight plot-hole for me.) he escaped to Amsterdam and a new life. That he chose.T2 opens on Renton's return to the Promised Land, an Edinburgh where the airport meeter greeters are Eastern European. A family without his mother (he didn't make the funeral). A Leith that is part-gentrified, although Sick Boy's Salamader Street flat symbolically overlooks a massive scrap metal yard, the graveyard of dream cars. A metaphor for life's finite span.The movie (very) roughly adapts Welch's Porno, but with many flashbacks and additional scenes from the Trainspotting novel that could have been in the original (not least the scene in Leith Central Station).The budget is six times the original and it shows. In good way. the cinematography bristles from start to finish (Anthony Dod Mantle) and the script bristles with comedy and tragedy in almost equal measure. The scene in the King William Bar (1690) is a classic.Not all the characters have fared as well as Renton.SickBoy, although lithe (thanks to the Charlie) owns his Aunty's boozer (the beautifully named Port Sunshine - Hibees ya bass) it's a doss house and in need of investment. His Bulgarian girlfriend Veronika is the only new character to join the fray and cleverly plays the tart with, half, a heart.Spud's still a, now suicidal, junkie.Begbie's still a bampot on the run from the jail.Spud, Sickboy and Renton join forces to turn the Port Sunshine into a cultural heritage landmark in Leith attracting considerable public investment. (For cultural heritage read brothel, sorry, sauna.)It turns into a hilarious revenge thriller with Begbie on the rampage.In a turnkey scene Renton sits with Veronika in the fancy Harvey Nichols Forth (sic) floor restaurant. He reminisces on the Choose Life soliloquy but reframes it, every bit as cynically, for 2017.""Choose Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and hope that someone, somewhere cares  Choose reality TV, slut shaming, revenge porn. Choose a zero-hours contract, a two-hour journey to work. And choose the same for your kids, only worse ""This is the point of the movie. It's not about nostalgia as so many reviews have said. What was great about the foursome's life in 1996? Absolutely nothing.No, this is about regret and the search for middle aged redemption. A new opportunity to escape the cycle of despair that the trio (Begbie couldn't care less) have immersed themselves in.It's an echo of the 1996 dream that, for Sickboy and Begbie, was stolen from them in that London hotel room. But you know, deep down, it's not going to work out. Is it?Danny Boyle and John Hodge have created a monumental movie. Poignant, funny, beautifully nuanced and reflecting (not nostalgically) their acknowledged masterpiece of 1996. The weaving together of three generations of the key characters' respective lives is effortless and the music mirrors that extremely subtly.Ewen Bremner is the real star with his beautifully sad performance as Spud. Ewan McGregor has grown into Renton's skin and can finally be forgiven the original miscasting. Robert Carlyle's Begbie just manages to steer clear of caricature, and delivers moments of high camp scariness.The whole thing is a blast.Go see it.By the way, credit to Harvey Nichols for granting the rights to use, and adapt, their outstanding shoplifting commercial as part of the movie.",T2 Trainspotting
70,coreyjdenford,Hop onto the nostalgia train,8,27 January 2017,"This review of T2: Trainspotting is spoiler free**** (4/5)""They may be twenty years older when trying to reconnect but they are still none the wiser"", was the quote from director Danny Boyle when promoting T2: Trainspotting that may be so but they have still moments of seriousness. They still have the emotion, the same taste or even the same mindset as they try to remember their time from 20 years ago. When Boyle announced that he was going to direct the very long-awaited sequel to the original 1996 cult classic, based on Irvine Welsh's fifth novel Porno there was a lot of controversy from fans of the first one; how would they do it? Where will it go? Does it need a sequel? Can you make a sequel after this long? Were the first few of their many questions that they asked, but when the release was announced it soon turned into one of the most anticipated British film sequels of all time. But is it as good? The film opens with Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) living in Amsterdam, dreaming of the past and all the good times he had with his friends, Begbie, Sick Boy and Spud, all those times they shared jokes and even had the odd bit of drugs. Then we transfer to Edinburgh, to Frank Begbie (Robert Carlyle) currently spending time in prison. Through to Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) an owner of one of the top bars in Scotland, then we spend with Spud (Ewan Bremner) who is trying to get back with his wife (Shirley Henderson) and kid, but also still goes through the addiction to heroine he had all those years ago. The arrival of Renton back at Edinburgh, they suddenly become happier but they also question him to see what he has been up to ""Hello Mark, so what have you been up to for twenty years?"" Sick Boy asks him towards the start of the film, it's a question that feels as if it's never going to be answered – seemingly hinting that we will never know what he has been up to. He does start to answer, stating that he had a job, a wife and a couple of kids but he is then interrupted by Boyle's transitioning to another character. It's a slightly disjointed opening to the very long-awaited sequel and it takes a while for the film to recover from it, but what happens after that during the second act slightly makes up for it. With Renton and Simon (a.k.a Sick Boy) trying to reconnect after years apart, it takes a while granted but when they finally join they are up to their previous shenanigans what essentially made the film's predecessor manic, but it goes of that style and tries to go a little more serious there are a couple of zingers from each of the characters, whereby Trainspotting had an insane amount of hilarious moments it's sequel veers away from it, it's as if these twenty have entirely changed these people. However their friendship falls with the return of Begbie who wants to reconnect with Sick Boy and Spud after spending years in prison but with Renton he still remembers what he did to him all that time ago, he wants revenge after being betrayed out of a lot of money, meanwhile Spud comes up with a new hobby to right stories of their time together, it's a way for him to come off the drugs and hopefully to get back with his wife. This starts to affect him dearly when he remembers one of his friends. It's a slightly blunt look back at the past as there are only a few fresh but short flashbacks of each of them. There are times when T2: Trainspotting riffs on the same aspects as its predecessor, especially one moment when Simon's partner Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova) wants to hear what Renton's mantra ""Choose life"" means, he states the many things that she could choose, it's a moment that is short but it brings back a slight feeling of nostalgia, yet there are many moments through the entire film that do that, though it's a blunt force of nostalgia that runs throughout there are many times when we feel it. In the second act it is a bit muddled as it tries to make up for the disjointed moments in the opening, the third certainly makes up for it, this is when it becomes the sequel we've all been waiting for. It becomes a little manic, there are many funny moments, some sad moments and there are some moments within the third act that bring back a lot of nostalgia, there is even a stunning shot of the three friends, going back to their former lives. It's fair to say the third act is the best part of the film that couldn't have come more timely. Sure enough T2: Trainspotting isn't anywhere near as manic, funny or as good as it's predecessor but there is still plenty here to enjoy for Boyle's first directed sequel, that time that we all waited is worth it as this film fills the twenty hole left from the first movie.VERDICT: Boyle's first ever sequel isn't as good or as manic as it's predecessor but there is still plenty here to enjoy, it's sometimes funny, it's sad and best of all it's a nostalgic look back to the 1996 cult classic, one of the best movies of 2017 so far.",T2 Trainspotting

I liked how the film keeps looking back at the original ""Trainspotting"" while at the same time making fun of the characters' chronic nostalgia (and ours). Sure the energy and freshness of 20 years ago are dead and gone, but I was positively surprised by Boyle's refined, yet sharp and imaginative visual direction in a few shots.",T2 Trainspotting

What a trainwreck this was. If you told me the person who made this never watched Trainspotting, I'd believe you. Unreal. The characters have nothing in common with the original guys.

74,renegadeviking-271-528568,T2 Trainspotting review,8,29 February 2020,"Sick Boy's 'Unifying Theory of Life' is certainly proven true in T2 Trainspotting. Our favourite Leith scamps had it - whatever 'it' was - and they've lost it. Now that the magic and indestructability of youth has dissipated, Renton, Simon, Spud, and Begbie, now middle-aged, have little to show for the last 20 years. Caught in a bleak cycle of regret, misplacement, bad choices, a search for something to replace addiction, and fruitless efforts to 'choose life', they search for fond nostalgia - reduced to being, as Simon remarks, 'tourists in their own youth'.A crossroads for each character sees them all returning home to Edinburgh with debts to pay, unfinished business to take care of, and a lot of baggage. With new and old faces popping up, Renton (Ewan McGregor) is home, escaping from a life in Amsterdam that has crumbled around him. 46-years-old and lost like a lone child in a supermarket, he goes back to the only place that resembles home in the hope of righting wrongs and starting again. He chose life, but it turns out life is harder than he thought it would be.Another lost soul is Simon (Jonny Lee Miller). Desperately clinging on to his playboy charm, youth, and looks, and trying to convince himself that he's still cool and business savvy, he, too, is struggling with what to do with his life. As much as Renton and Simon could kill each other at times, they also can't live without each other. And together they resort to their old life of seedy, money-making scams and dodgy dealings that could see them getting into more trouble than they ever expected.Spud (Ewen Bremner), resembling a baby-faced old man now more than ever, is utterly adorable and hilarious in his heart-warming fondness for his long-lost friends, his childlike sentimentality and sensitivity, and his inherent goodness. Arguably the only character out of the four who is truly good at the core, Spud's story takes a heart-breaking and seemingly hopeless turn. Still a Leith junkie - popping pills, sniffing powder, and injecting heroin - Spud is still very much stuck in a cycle of behaviour, dreaming of the days when youth offered a vessel through which he could plunge into oblivious and forget about the real world. For fans of Irvine Welsh's Porno (2002), which T2 Trainspotting is very loosely based on, you can expect to see the same new literary side of Spud that features in the novel, but with a dramatic and very clever twist towards the end.
T2 Trainspotting (@T2Trainspotting) January 25, 2017As for the man, the myth, the legend, Francis Begbie (Robert Carlyle), he's out of prison. But when I say 'out', I mean he's escaped. As terrifying as ever, Begbie is on a rampage to track down the man he's been plotting his revenge against for the last two, cold decades in an Edinburgh prison. And his opportunity has finally come.The showdown between Rents and Franco, the ultimate square-go 20 years in the making, is everything we could've hoped for. With Spud and Simon on hand to intervene, an adrenaline-fuelled dual takes place, filled with fist-clenching, literal mouth-gaping moments. It is at this point, too, that we see the film's tense, most shocking moment as a life quite literally hangs in the balance.With a soundtrack - dare I say it - better than the last, a greater depth of emotion and sentiment, T2 Trainspotting is not Trainspotting. As Diane (Kelly Macdonald) predicted, the world has changed, music has changed, even drugs have changed. T2 Trainspotting is a whole other film, a whole new animal. The film stands alone as a reflection and a fitting tribute to its predecessor that grows old but doesn't quite grow up with its legion of adoring fans. Dealing with issues of masculinity, adulthood, parenthood, and getting old, T2 Trainspotting offers audiences a detailed background of this dysfunctional family dynamic that is steeped in history, loyalty, betrayal, and, somewhere underneath it all, love. With moments of memorial for lost friends and a look back at darker times, T2 Trainspotting contains several flashbacks and parallels to the original in a film that is somewhat self-aware of the incomparable legacy it is part of.#T2Trainspotting stars Ewen Bremner, @mcgregor_ewan, Director Danny Boyle, @jonnylmiller and @robertcarlyle_ at a photo call today. pic.twitter.com/7RZczIspMIT2 Trainspotting (@T2Trainspotting) January 25, 2017The performances delivered by the original cast are superb, with Ewen Bremner, in particular, serving up an exceptional portrayal of everyone's favourite catboy. In a story of bitterness, ghosts of the past, and new hope in a new plot with tears, surprises, and massive laughs, filmgoers and diehard Trainspotting fans alike are in for a treat. Director Danny Boyle hasn't tried to create a cheap, copycat version of the original - something everyone will be thankful for. He's done something completely different. T2 Trainspotting is truly original, unmissable, and deserving of following in the footsteps of Danny Boyle's original phenomenon that is rightly adored the world over.",T2 Trainspotting
75,v-56289,what went wrong?,5,3 April 2020,I love Trainspotting.. But this was not even close to the original movie.. I can't say it was bad.. but I expected similar crazy- funny.. but it was just weird - nostalgic..,T2 Trainspotting
76,kaptenvideo-89875,Still a damn fine junkie movie in its own right,7,20 March 2017,"What's with the title? Everybody knows that T2 means only Terminator 2 and this kind of abbreviation should not be used in other cases! But the movie itself is not bad, not bad at all. Most of all a sequel and fan service to modern classic Trainspotting"" (1996), still a damn fine junkie movie in its own right, which flung Ewan McGregor and director Danny Boyle to international movie career-dom. It also certainly helped the other stars such as Kelly Macdonald, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner – but they have stayed relatively less known to wider public, especially just by the name.I don't want to reveal too much about the events but the Renton is back home and tries to make up with the old buddies that he robbed blind before leaving for good 20 years ago.So, the gang is back, ready to give choosing life another go. If you care about the first movie, you will probably like the new one too. If you don't know the characters and faces, then it's probably harder to hop on the Scottish city youth working class junkie"" train and instantly care about the main characters and their quarrels.But everybody behind and in front of the camera gives their darndest best to make you like the material, and they succeed. The result has enough action, humor, suspense, and depth to be recommended for newcomers also.Both Trainspottings"" are partially based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh. The 1996's movie was a straight-er adaptation, the second one uses a bit of both the original novel and the sequel Porno"" to create something new-ish. It would be fair to call the result an action comedy that stands on its own, but keeping the original's sense of black comedy intact, and the characters of course. T2"" may not look much like the Trainspotting"" but it feels so fresh and captivating that that's not gonna be a problem. We will get all kinds of tongue-in-cheek nods to the original experience but the visual style is exciting and modern, as it should many years later. Boyle truly is one of the more interesting directors working today, as his countless fans would gladly agree. .I've read many of Welsh's books, including Trainspotting"" and Porno"". I've also seen all of the movie versions (excluding Ecstasy""), with the favorite being The Acid House"". I feel that T2"" is the most un-Welsh-like adaptation so far, and it strays from the novel, but it's not a bad thing because the movie makers have managed to carve out something new, fresh and interesting. There's less of doing drugs in T2"" but somehow there's an even sharper sense of what drugs can do to a person and relationships in the long run. The deeper message is sharp: if you don't find a meaning to your life, there's not gonna be much of a life for you in store.Acting is fine all around but I especially like how much Carlyle as the notorious Begbie has changed. He seems even more reckless, horrifying and dangerous than before – up there with cinema history's greatest bad guys surely –, but there's also a new unspoken dimension of sadness and unlived potential which the actor translates and brings to the screen. It's a masterful performance and actually the emotional anchor to movie as a whole.So all in all, this is a good example of a sequel done right. I did not exactly need this but am surely glad that they made it anyway, and with some conviction and purpose. It will not stay in memory as long as the predecessor but it's well made in every aspect!",T2 Trainspotting

78,gallagherkellie,Jumbled Mess,5,3 June 2017,"The plot was at times confusing an not well written. The first movie was amazing, one of my favourites, and I was excited to see this one. I was let down, the acting was good and it was great to see the same characters and where they are now, but that's about it. Worth watching to see what's been happening the last 20 years but don't expect much.",T2 Trainspotting
79,mistoppi,Perfection!,10,17 February 2017,"It's been a while since I saw Trainspotting. While it's amazing and fun and all, it's also super rough. I still love it though, and it's one of my favourite movies of all time. I actually own a copy of the novel in ""English"" but since actual English isn't my first language it's super hard trying to read an entire novel written in dialect. So I haven't read Trainspotting, so I can't really say if Trainspotting is as good as the book, and I also haven't read Porno, so I don't know whether or not T2 Trainspotting is anywhere near the original.I was a little worried about a lot of things. First of all, character development - for better or worse. 20 years is a long time. If the characters would've seem pretty much same people, it would've felt awful. But it seems there has been some kind of development. It's not like they are over their issues, no, they are pretty much just as bad as they were or maybe worse. Did anyone get better? Probably not, but that's better than everyone staying the same.I went to the cinema thinking well I can't give this movie 10/10, since I gave the LEGO Batman Movie and Tom Of Finland 10/10, it would be an overkill. But when the movie was ending, I started thinking... was there anything wrong with it? Not really. The story is great, so very thrilling, and so much fun. When I think about what it's about, I can't summarise the actual plot easily. It's basically just a revisit to the story, but it's also so much more than that. The original movie had such a perfect ending, but it leaves the audience wondering. T2 Trainspotting gives us the closure we need. But like it's mostly a nostalgic trip, and definitely a good one.It's amazing to see how the cinematography both hasn't and has changed. There are so many shots that are very similar to the original movie - clearly on purpose. Still there's something that's new, just like with the story and characters. The shots and the editing, lighting and colours are all brilliant. Mixture of old footage and new on is also amazing, especially on a big screen where you can so clearly see the difference. The cinematography is so very enchanting and I loved it very much.. I especially loved the effects where the shots froze. .(Unless the movie was just lagging. I hope not, because they were very effective)But what I love most about this movie was the soundtrack. The music was perfect, it was so amazing. The only thing missing was Iggy Pop's Lust for Life (there was a remix tho), because I just kept waiting for it, but it didn't play. Still that doesn't matter. The sounds in this movie were amazing and the music was so well chosen and so effective, and just simply astonishing.I really loved this movie, more than I thought I would.",T2 Trainspotting
80,Gresh854,Contains That Golden Material That Made The First One Such A Masterpiece,6,7 April 2017,"Going into Trainspotting 2 I had very high expectations considering I love the original masterpiece also directed by Danny Boyle. Typically I don't go into films with high expectations but I did with Trainspotting because I honestly didn't know how to feel about the making of this sequel. I always thought that Trainspotting worked as a singular film and never needed a sequel what-so-ever. So going into T2 I was like, ""OK if they're going to make a sequel to Trainspotting it better be damn good and not just be a nostalgia-trip rehash of the first film. Luckily I can safely say that T2 Trainspotting is everything I could ever hope for in a newly told tale of the old Trainspotting gang. I have but a couple of knit picks with this film which I'll get into later, but overall I honestly had a blast watching T2. This film contains all the smart movie tricks and turns that the first Trainspotting did, but manages to stand on its own as something else. T2 goes in depth about time jumping within people's lives; about what makes certain promises or betrayals different 20 years later. I was extremely surprised to see that this film was able to handle such a unique subject and put it into a very contained, but moving and intriguing film, that's really just centered on a couple of people's lives. Right now we are living in a world where Hollywood is remaking older classics, and making tons of sequels to films we love that never live up to their titles. T2 is a fantastic example for Hollywood, of what to do when making a sequel to a beloved movie. Quickly I'll get it out of the way that seeing the old gang (Renton played by Ewan McGregor, Spud played by Ewen Bremner, Simon played by Jonny Lee Miller, and Begbie played by Robert Carlyle) was pure cinematic gold. Although the gang has a very different relationship within' this film compared to the first Trainspotting (considering this is 20 years after the first time this gang was together, and because of other plot points that I won't get into in case you haven't seen the first Trainspotting), it adds a new addition to something we have never seen the gang deal with before, which makes this movie differentiate compared to the first film. Something that was absolutely lovely to see again was the usual Trainspotting tropes. The unique editing styles, the brilliantly written dialogue, the heart pounding electronic music, and the unique visual styles were such a treat to see once again in T2. Throughout the film I never felt as if the film was slow paced or uninteresting because you are always so intrigued into these people lives, even though they are essentially the world's definition of ""losers"", but I strongly feel like that's what makes T2 and the predecessor so special. It makes you care so much about these people who you never want to be, and kind of look down upon. Now the few flaws I have in the film are a bit nit-picky. They didn't hugely affect my enjoyment of the film and never quite bothered me that much but they are however flaws. There is this new character they add to the film named Veronika, and all though Anjela Nedyalkova (Veronika) acts great in the film and has some good moments, she felt unnecessary. She kind of felt like she was just in the movie to be this ""character"" that wasn't in the first one, and while like I said, she does do a fair job in the film, I feel like she could've been cut out and it wouldn't have affected my enjoyment of the movie. Also even though some of the nostalgic callbacks to the original film are awesome, they sometimes can feel a little too heavy-handed and overdone, particularly a certain one that happens towards the end. Other than that, I can honestly say that I truly loved T2 Trainspotting. It was everything I could hope for in a sequel to a cult classic, and I can't wait to see it again and pick up the Blu-Ray. I'm going to give T2 Trainspotting a grade of a solid A, and a IMDb score of a 9/10.",T2 Trainspotting
81,supermaggie,No worthy sequel to one of the best movies ever + no good movie on its own,5,8 March 2017,"I have loved the first movie for over 20 years now (yes, I also still have my walls plastered with posters since then) and it is one of the movies that will always be on top of my list and a heavy influence for me in any respect of life, and - don't get me wrong - I was overjoyed that a sequel was made and I still am, but I can not at all agree with the positive reviews at all. What I expect from a good movie and from a Danny Boyle movie in particular and also from any sequel, is, that it can stand on its own and be entertaining on its own. T2 Trainspotting does not do this at all. It is a revival of the first movie at times, but most of all it makes clear, how good the first one was and how bad the second is. Or maybe bad is too harsh a word. Let me elaborate: growing old is bad, there is no sugarcoating it, it is. When you get older, you escape into memories of the past where things were better/cool/cooler, where you were better/cool/cooler. Nothing really gets better with time. And then there is rumors about one of the ultra-cool things from your cool past being continued - and you jump for joy, because it is the promise that there might be a chance that something cool might take place now/a new cool thing, and the old(er) guys can still be cool and pull it off - and then: disappointment, they cannot. It's the confirmation of your fear and the destruction of your hope. T2 got nothing on the first movie, it's not creative, not wise, not funny, it doesn't rock, it doesn't shock, it's just there, reminding you that all hope is lost. It makes sense for people who liked the first movie and who care about what happened to the characters, but the answer is not entertaining or satisfying but dull and bleak. And if you do not know or like the first movie, T2 does not make any sense at all. I did expect much, much more, this is NO worthy sequel, no worthy Boyle movie, this is grave robbery, desecrating the memory of a perfect piece of art and adding nothing new/good/worthwhile. And don't let me get started about the brothel-BS. I was looking forward to this, but it was not worth the wait. Gracious 5 points for the opportunity to meet the characters again (and I am not talking about Begbie, there could have been much less scenes with/about him IMO), but it's no fun seeing them where they are now (just confirms: some people never win, like Rod sang: some guys have all the luck some guys have all the pain - if this is the message/point of the movie: well-done). No person who watches this installment first is gonna want to see the original/first movie or understand, why people liked/loved the first one. This will not win new fans and not even please all old fans. Very sad/disappointing",T2 Trainspotting
82,pivic,"Carlyle sparkles, film's too much of a bad caricature of itself",6,1 March 2017,"This is more a film, I think, which is about aging and repeating your past than anything else. Sure, the characters are older, but I cringe a lot as Boyle has chosen to have them repeat some of their ""fave lines"" from the first film, 21 years later, for no apparent reason.The slow parts move best, for example, where Renton visits his father, despite that one being sappy. The ""new girl"", basically a Renton, doesn't bring much to the table.However, Robbie Carlyle steals the show; where Ewen Bremner's ""Spud"" previously did, by being a comedic maestro with his movements and druggy cadence, he is now converted into a caricature of himself - and yes, I am aware that druggies who have been on dope for more than two decades tend to turn into caricatures in more ways than one - while Begbie offers more. A lot more.Carlyle's acting is so strong that even Begbie's most obvious characteristics - e.g. as displayed where his son stands up against him by wanting to go to college to learn hotel management instead of joining his dad in a life of crime - turn interesting. He's a tour de force.Still, while this film is interesting and entertaining, it is too much of a parody of itself to become a truly interesting introspective. And the plot turn at the end was really a bit too tell-tale and boring to me.",T2 Trainspotting

I like Spuds character arc, Begbie was still scary as hell and Sick Boy was fun. What hacked me off most was Rentons character. The lovable hero of the first film who you rooted for is now a scheming, unlikable person who is a crim and uses people with little afterthought. I do think they ruined his character. The plot was messy also. I think T2 was worth doing and it was nice to see these guys back on the screen but I would recommend there not being a T3.",T2 Trainspotting

87,Padreviews,8.5/10 Choose T2 Choose Edinburgh,8,2 February 2017,"Very good , better than you'd expect . In fact it was brilliant :) A lot of films that have a sequel many years after are a pale attempt at replicating a masterpiece . This isn't one , this actually fits seamlessly into 1996 Trainspotting . The Gang of Four are back and so is the crime wave ,sex and narcotics . Danny Boyle really has pulled this off . The characters are so endearing in their own way and the occasional edit inputting scenes from the original Trainspotting was brilliant . The cinematography was exceptional with constant juxtapositioning of the beauty of old Edinburgh against the concrete monstrosities of the 60s tower blocks and the redevelopment of the industrial leith against it historic past . The acting was superb across the board , Ewen Bremner standing out just slightly above the others though Robert Carlisle deserves a mention for being frightening in every scene . It was good to see Kelly Macdonald and Irvine Welsh in cameo roles too .The addition of the Bulgarian beauty Veronika as a strap on massage mistress brought in parts of the follow up novel PORNO whilst the finale sets up the possibility of T3 as the story goes full circle . It starts with an opportunity ....and ends with a betrayal .",T2 Trainspotting
88,koofasa,I really wanted to like this movie,5,29 October 2019,"I loved the original Trainspotting movie. That was back when Danny Boyle, Ewan McGregor, and Jonny Lee Miller were all doing top notch independent film. They took risks and showed us a world we never would have otherwise seen. Remember how skinny Ewan got to play a heroin addict? That world they showed us really did exist and that's why we all bought it. Then these key people went on to do more mainstream projects and they lost their edge. This movie has its moments but it's mostly a disjointed story that holds your attention for only a few minutes at a time. Sometimes I would lose interest in the middle of a sentence. The movie doesn't seem as Scottish as the first; it doesn't feel as authentic. The Scots accents start out strong and then fade back to EU English within a single scene. It's probably because the world they are trying to show in this sequel no longer exists or never existed.",T2 Trainspotting
89,Semisonic,"The world has changed, the misfits are the same",8,5 June 2017,"The first Trainspotting was a movie that defined a generation. A generation rebelling against the social conventions and choosing self-destruction instead. Twenty one years later, the once familiar characters return, so that we can see where that rebellion has led them.You might say that the sequel was unnecessary and it's a step down. It's a step down alright, but making that step has an important meaning attached. It shows us all that even for those who ""choose life"" as a mockery, the life still continues. In that sense, confirming that the pack of misfit heroes from the first movie lasted that far is a great sign of hope for those rebelling against the foundations of life today. Hope that this gamble doesn't need to be fatal.However, T2 is by no means a manifesto its predecessor has become. The first Trainspotting's ""choose life"" was a truly powerful message, a statement of rejection of the contemporary values due to their utter vanity. People were betting their lives on that rejection, and that alone was putting them at the avant-garde of the modern art, winning the hearts and minds of millions.What T2 poses as its message is not a defying challenge to the society, but rather a distress call of the helpless ones who failed to find their spot in this world. Those who aren't young anymore, not strong enough to swim against the current and not smart enough to have found a safe harbor. Right now their manifesto is nothing more than a bunch of reflections about the modern world from a bunch of sad and tired losers. They wish they could embrace the social values of the contemporary world - those values they once rebelled against - but nobody grants them that chance, so instead they are forced to parasitize - financially and conceptually - on the people they used to laugh at, yet are jealous of their current superficial wellbeing and shallow happiness.Strangely enough, however, T2 bears much more hope for redemption than the image of the grinning Mark Renton crossing the bridge at the end of the 1996's film. Because, however worn out and disillusioned, the former rebels aren't running anymore - and being able to confront their inner demons and looming father figures from the past is worth more than one could imagine. If Trainspotting was the quintessence of escapism, then T2 is the epitome of homecoming. And maybe, for the first time in a long while, the weary souls can be in peace with themselves. That notion alone is enough reason for T2 to exist.",T2 Trainspotting
90,BrickNash,Choppy and inconsisnet,5,6 August 2018,"Trainspotting was a defining film for me. It came out in my final year of school and it played a big part in making me want to be a filmmaker.This sequel, although stylishly shot, really doesn't come up to the original's standards, and it's mostly down to the suspension of disbelief being broken through inconsistencies.Begbie suddenly has a family who have sprung up from out of nowhere and I just didn't buy it for one second. The character of Veronika is charming, but she just feels like a hastily re-written replacement for Diane and it would have been far more nostalgic had Kelly MacDonald taken that place as Diane in the film, becasue it seems like most of the conversations that Renton and Veronika have were meant for him and Diane.Apart from that, the pacing feels quite choppy and inconsistent. Bar Sickboy and Renton, the guys don't really hang around together than much in the film, and now that Begbie is pretty much the villain of the piece he is almost totally removed from the group for the majority of the movie, so all that original chemistry feels fractured.Add to this the story about building a sex sauna just isn't interesting and it doesn't come near the original film's pure character struggles with the heavy drug element.It's not a bad film by any means, but it lacks the absorbing grab factor of the original, and while there are moments of greatness, it's just lost in a pretty bland story with weak motivations and a inconsistent narrative, most of which feels forced. It felt like they had a decent idea but had to re-write bits and then cram it in to a sub standard reason to have them all together again.Worth a look for sure, but for me it falls short.",T2 Trainspotting
91,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Why?,3,12 October 2018,"It is such a shame that many directors choose to film sequels of truly great movies, spoiling the memory of the original ones and ''T2'' is the best example. I am an ardent fan of ''Trainspotting'' and I firmly believe that is one of the contemporary masterpieces of the big screen. I also believe that it is also one of the rarest cases when the film is better than the novel, Danny Boyle's take on the book written by the Scottish author, Irvine Welsh was a brilliant, colorful and animated version of the novel. So, as you can imagine, I was more than eager to see the continuation of the story, 20 years after the events of the first film. The result was one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I've experienced the last 5 years. The movie is supposed to be based on the second book in the ''Trainspotting'' series, titled ''Porno'', though the story and the plot are almost entirely different and in the largest part seems like a caricature, a parody of the original characters and atmosphere which captured me immediately in the 1996 film. Honestly, I feel that I have the obligation to warn all hardcore ''Trainspotting'' fanatics who expect a repetition of the original film's success. Similar attempts on rebooting legendary stories should be avoided by all directors in the future.",T2 Trainspotting
92,bastille-852-731547,As Great As Its Predecessor,9,1 April 2017,"I'm a big fan of the original ""Trainspotting,"" and was naturally excited when it was announced that a sequel would be in production. That said, I was somewhat hesitant that it would be a generic cash-grab. Thankfully, I can confirm that the sequel is excellent--just like its predecessor--and is as fresh, modern, and darkly funny for current times as the original was to audiences in 1996. The acting is very good throughout, particularly Ewan McGregor playing Renton again. However, the best things about the film are the little 'nuts and bolts' that make Trainspotting what it really is: the cinematography and juxtaposition of images, the unique tone (black comedy mixed with darker themes,) the uniquely Scottish sense of humor, and the music. All of the above enhance the movie, but the film truly becomes great by how relevant it is. Renton and his friends feel a mix of hopefulness and pessimism, but their struggles and concerns have adapted to the times. The film comments considerably on modern life and the ways that things have changed since the first film was released, which makes the nostalgia even more powerful and impactful. The sense of cynicism here is blunt and honest, but wry laughs still come through. The film is also very entertaining as well, and the plot is executed very well--especially considering how clearly everything ties into the first movie. All in all, this was an excellent sequel that served not only as entertainment, but as a lens of nostalgia through strong performances, dry writing, and a bitter realization of modern times. Very highly recommended for fans of the original. 9/10",T2 Trainspotting
93,dougmacdonaldburr,Good Not Great,7,1 January 2019,"For all of it's flaws the first Trainspotting was great. The second is good, but, it fails to reach the same heights. Watching a bunch of pseudo intellectual scumbag heroin addicts is kind of entertaining when they are in their early 20s, but, when they are middle aged it is mostly just sad. I never really like Spud, the harmless heroin addict with the heart of gold, but, 20 years later he is even more pathetic, and I cannot find sympathy for him when you see how his actions affect the people he loves. Renton is cool, but, he is still a complete dick. All he does by returning is bring chaos and hurt his so called friends. He is not a good person at all. The character I like the most is Sick boy, but, he is a jerk too. The Bulgarian woman is very cute, but, she doesn't really add anything other than that. Robert Carlyle plays a great psychopath. His character actually has the most self awareness. The others are all narcissistic degenerates who ruin the lives of everyone close to them. Begbie at least knows he is an evil psychopath. However, this self awareness does not excuse his actions. He is a terrible person. This film really doesn't offer anything more than charming performances, nostalgia and updated style. That being said, all of that is more than enough to keep it entertaining. So overall this film is good, but not great. If you liked the first one, you will probably like this one too.",T2 Trainspotting
94,diand_,Caught in the past,6,22 February 2017,"Picking up several years later, Renton returns from his hideout in Amsterdam to make up for his lost years with his friends and of course pay them back (without rent by the way). What follows is a trip down memory lane meeting up once again with all the characters plus a Bulgarian younger girl to introduce a new part in the story.What is really good about the movie is the very imaginative, fast and quirky visual storytelling, often noticeable in small scenes: a lift getting on screen numbers for example. This is a trademark of Danny Boyle, and it is further enhanced by the really outstanding work of longtime collaborator and DoP Anthony Dod Mantle.It also interesting to see how times have changed and the surveillance state made its introduction: Mobiles that can be tracked, and also shots from observation cameras are used in the movie. The ""Choose Life"" narration is repeated in a modern, adapted version. And this is a movie where the soundtrack finally gets proper attention. From the opening song Shotgun Mouthwash by High Contrast to the excellent Prodigy remix of Iggy Pop's Lust for Life, very effectively used in the end shot.Was it a good idea to make a sequel from this? The audience expects more of the same, and definitely gets it here. The plot is nearly identical with another twist. But can the director bring something new that isn't explored already? In the end the answer is generally no and here and there yes, and we end up with a movie where not only the characters, but also the viewers are caught in the past.",T2 Trainspotting
95,joshbarton15,T2 Trainspotting is definitely a sequel worth the wait,8,28 January 2017,"A lot has changed in the twenty years since Trainspotting was first released; Danny Boyle has gone on to become such a diverse and exciting director, the four leading men of the ensemble cast have each had varying successes throughout their careers and well, Edinburgh has developed into somewhat more of a nicer area than it was back then.There has been a lot of hype surrounding T2 Trainspotting as it's the sequel to one of the best and most quintessential British films ever made however, is twenty years too long of a gap between the films? The answer is a resounding no because T2 Trainspotting is such a different film from the first and that's what makes this sequel worth being made. Twenty years since he betrayed his friends and left Scotland £16,000 richer, Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns to Scotland to make amends with those he wronged. He finds Daniel ""Spud"" Murphy (Ewen Bremner) still addicted to heroin and Simon ""Sick Boy"" Williamson (Jonny Lee Miller) setting up blackmail targets in order to make money.There's one face Renton is keen to avoid in particular and that's Francis ""Franco"" Begbie's (Robert Carlyle), his psychopathic friend who certainly hasn't forgotten the betrayal and is keen to teach Renton a lesson.Twenty years is a long time, especially in film, so it was always a bit of a mixed reaction when I first heard a sequel to Trainspotting was actually being made. On one hand I was sceptical because there's been so many sequel that have left it too long and just ended up being nowhere near as good as the original, and on the other hand I was enthused by the news, particularly with the fact that both Danny Boyle and the original cast would be coming back. I mean, doing a sequel to Trainspotting would just be criminal without these guys.It would have been easy and pretty poor of them to just make the same film they did twenty years ago however, like in most people's lives, things change. It makes for a much more interesting sequel as Danny Boyle delivers a film that reintroduces us to these familiar characters yet quickly informs us that, most of them, are living much different lives than before. Aided by a brilliantly dark screenplay from John Hodge, Boyle's T2 Trainspotting is a similarly energetic beast to the first.The film's visual appeal is again attained through sharp editing from Jon Harris and some creative cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle, both making it very clear that this is unmistakably a Danny Boyle film. I mentioned the energy of the film before and while it moves along at a fast pace, I like how it's notably slower than the first film, mirroring the diminishing energy levels of the characters in comparison to their youth.Coming to the performances, T2 Trainspotting possesses four leads who clearly want to do justice to the original film that put them all on the map. Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner all do a great job with Hodge's screenplay however, the real stand out performance comes from Robert Carlyle as Begbie. Carlyle has always been an underrated actor and he really is brilliant in this film, harnessing the psychopathic side of Begbie's personality and running wild with it throughout, combining with Boyle's filmmaking to great effect.T2 Trainspotting is a worthy sequel that, while not besting the original, brings something new to the table and takes us on another ride with these much loved characters from British cinema. The only gripe I had with the film was their choice not to use Iggy Pop's version of Lust for Life to close out the film, which would have made much more sense instead of the cover version they chose to use.",T2 Trainspotting
96,barbagvido,Actually a lot more awesome than I expected it to be,10,15 September 2017,"T2:Trainspotting is a sequel to a 1996 film Trainspotting. The first one told a story about a group of young junkies ruining their lives, but this when gathers them again, 21 years later (yes, they somehow survived that long). And now they are back for new adventures, only this time without drugs.Whenever a very critically acclaimed movie that is regarded a classic gets a sequel, there are reasons to be concerned. It might ruin the original's legacy, it might be just a pointless cash-grab, it might be a copy of the original, it might be a lot of things. Thankfully, T2:Trainspotting is none of these things. An extremely unpopular opinion here (please don't hate me), I liked this even better than the original. They both kinda tell the same message, just in a different way. The first one was more like ""Don't do drugs because this is what will happen to you."" while this one is more like ""Don't do drugs, because there are way better options."". That's why I found this movie to be kinda beautiful and actually pretty heart-warming. Especially with the whole idea of being ""high on life"". People should actually live by that today. One minor flaw I had though was that the same hyperactive and weird direction and editing didn't work as well with this story. Since they are no longer junkies we don't really need that ""drugged"" feel of the first one. It's not as excessive, thankfully, but it's there. And while it didn't drag the movie down, it's noticeable.Still, let alone that minor flaw, this is a beautiful sequel with a beautiful message. While the first one might have made you feel sick, this one will make you feel very satisfied.",T2 Trainspotting
97,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Does anybody even care?,5,19 August 2020,"I don't understand the point of this film at all? For people who saw the original some 20-odd years ago, there is no need to give us constant flashbacks as we are perfectly aware of what happened back then, thank you very much, and for people who are new to the story altogether, it has no relevance or reference to anything!Large parts of the film felt like a retrospective attempt to gain reactions such as 'oh yeah, I remember that', while forgetting how much the past is firmly embedded into our memories anyway. And I don't need reminding because I can watch and enjoy the original Trainspotting whenever I want, so, I'm guessing the target audience is people just like me, check that, but with no brain or long-term memory capabilities, which really confused me.Also, the film went nowhere in its attempt to revamp the original and attempt to outdo it, which begs the question, why didn't they give us a new film with all these great characters and memories and simply move on to something new? Why so patronizing and quaint? It was a weird experience for me.I want to say something majorly positive about this film, but I can't really, other than to reiterate how sacred things from the past should be left alone. Directors and producers have helped to ruin franchises like Star Wars and Alien in recent years through blatant cash grabs, and this is no different, but even after my moans and misgivings, I can't be too harsh on it because it's hopefully just a one off and wasn't totally crap, plus it was nice to see some old faces again. But such wasted potential.",T2 Trainspotting
98,anthonyf94,Time goes faster for criminals,7,5 October 2019,"Lot of year's after the first chapter, ""Trainspotting"" returns for a new adventure, lived in the same world of drugs, violence, urbanity and betrayals. In general, I don't like a lot sequels made with a big distance from the first movie: often they are just a commercial use of the myth created by the initial work. For""Trainspotting"" it is in this way for half: for example, I think that's too fast the way in which the main character reaches his old friends and forgets the hate between them. This makes me think that maybe the atmosphere of the first movie remains intact if we consider that story closed forever: this sequel could simply haven't been done. But if we want to see the positive points of this movie thought as something a part from he other film, we could find the most interesting part in the signs that time leaves on this people and how the juvenile mythology build in the first movie is easily deleted for old criminals that can't manipulate really the world that they have in front of them, as in the first movie a rock energy could transmit. Especially Franco, the real antagonist of this second chapter, has his problem with the relationship with his son and his wife most than with justice. And all the characters live a tired lottery of possible betrayals among all of them, as a nonsense of actions thought as magnificent in their criminality but in reality poor and slow.
In conclusion, nothing special, but a good movie, that's better to watch not to much with the idea of the first chapter.",T2 Trainspotting

100,midas-jacobs,Choose life. Choose a movie. Choose a good sequel.,7,2 March 2017,"Renton goes back to Scotland to revisit his old friends.Danny Boyle also went back to direct this film, after twenty years. Boyles directing as exactly the same as in the first film, and was very fun to see in our modern time. It's nothing that you see these days, and probably won't see again, but with Danny his films. He was also very creative from a visual standpoint. The use of color was eccentric and the angles he filmed at were weird, but also created a good- looking shot. What I also liked was how he utilized shadow. He used it when Renton goes back to his old house, and sits at a table, but without his mum, because she had passed away. Instead of having nothing there, it was made to look like her shadow was sitting there. Of this use of shadow are a couple of scenes. Danny Boyle also utilized what I think was a beamer very creatively. He used this to tell a story that one character was narrating. I found this to be inventive and this too made for some good looking shots. The editing as well was fantastic. It was weird at first, but throughout the film you get used to it. At times there were jump-cuts, which I didn't like. The freeze frames were a bit troublesome in the beginning, but after a while I started to appreciate their value. The soundtrack was just like the original film: fantastic. Iggy Pop really works with the theme of the film. Now what I didn't really like was that the emphasis wasn't really on the heroin anymore. This was one of the better parts of the previous film, and felt like it was its ""character"" on its own. Don't get me wrong, there still is an overabundant of drugs in the film, but the emphasis didn't lay in that category. What I did like was that they re-used some scenes from the first film and recreated shots. They also referenced the first film a lot (the dirty toilet, the gun with which they shoot in the park in the first film), which I like and is something fun for the ones who've seen the first film to look for. But by doing this they really search for support in the nostalgia factor, something the movie might support quite a bit on.The acting was good. The main actors (Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle), were fun to be seeing there iconic characters again, but at times I felt that their acting didn't hold up to what they did previously. They were still pretty good, nonetheless, but just didn't reach the high notes I was hoping for. Robert Carlyle was probably the best out of the whole ensemble as Begbie. You could see in their acting that the cast had a ton of fun making this film, which also translated to the screen. This time around we didn't only have the original cast, but also Veronika, played by Anjela Nedyalkova. She was just OK, nothing really spectacular. The script was the main problem of this film. What once was the height of the first film is now the lowness of this one. The dialogue was very weak and at times. There were some good lines, but those were mostly used in the trailer. The monologue of the origin of ""Choose Life"" was good and so was the line ""You're just a tourist in your own youth"", which practically describes this film very well. I also can't deny that there were a lot of funny moments. They didn't always make sense, but I got enjoyment out of them. The chemistry between Sick Boy, Renton and Spud was still there, and Spud's character hadn't really changed except of becoming a more broken person, which was pretty painful to see. The story was pretty messy and they just forget about some items, like the lawsuit on Sick Boy. I think that that was just an excuse to reintroduce a character from the first film: Diane. It was fun seeing her again, but because of the little screen time she got and the useless screen time she got, I don't really get why she was in the film, other than nostalgia. The story went all over the place and lacked focus on certain aspects. There's just a lot going on and it keeps on branching of into side-story lines, which didn't really help with keeping the story good. I did like the idea that Spud wrote ""Trainspotting"" himself, which was a fun addition to the film, even though it was one of the many branches. Now was this film good? Yes. But I was quite disappointed. Maybe I was expecting something similar to ""Trainspotting"", I don't really know. The film supports heavily on the previous film and its nostalgia, whereby I'm not really sure if it can stand well on its own. The story is messy, but it was very well and creatively directed and edited, accompanied by the iconic, well-chosen soundtrack. That's why this one gets a 7.2/10.",T2 Trainspotting

102,M_Exchange,Much darker than the first one (if you can believe it),7,29 March 2017,"The '90s were best represented by songs that had dark, depressing lyrics that were concealed by catchy, uplifting melodies. On TV, even ""Seinfeld"" featured misanthropic, mean people who somehow made us happy regardless. To that end, Trainspotting was the essential movie of the '90s. It was often dark and cold, yet the image of Ewan McGregor as Mark Renton chuckling as he tries to evade the police or smiling as he walks away from ripping off his friends is the most prominent impression that many of us have from that film.But this film is mostly humorless, and even its few bits of comedy are glib and dark. I repeatedly wondered if it was really a continuation of the characters' story or Danny Boyle's manifesto about aging and life itself. When Renton speaks, there is barely a trace of the sarcasm and irony that he had in the original film. He just tends to lay things out in bleak terms, and the film's cold ending seems to bear out everything that he says.There were very few laughs to be had in this film, and there was no epiphany that any of the characters had that would have countered its dark undertone. One might argue that near the end one of the characters seems to change-- until he tries to kill someone. Throughout the movie, and especially at the end as depressing images of hoary elderly men were interspersed with youthful people, Boyle seems to hammer home a theme relentlessly: you are *trapped* in the boring, soul-crushing process of aging, and even if you rediscover your youth and break free from it temporarily, it will grab you by the throat again eventually. I want to believe that he applied this message only to the bad characters who made bad decisions in the film, but I get the feeling that he applies it to everyone in the world.6.5 rounded up to 7",T2 Trainspotting

Perfectly executed and deftly-made sequel that for once, is completely worthy of the original film. T2 picks up 20 years after the original story, and we find these 4 friends are living the old saying ""Everything changes, nothing changes."" But much like the first film, the plot takes off right out of the gate, and never lets up. The story picks up with Marc Renton (Ewen McGregor) returning to Scotland to pay off some old debts, literally and otherwise, and finds the old gang are still living the same kind of hard-scrabble lives as before. They are just trying to get by by getting over, and doing poorly at it. It soon becomes clear that even after 20 years, these guys have little more then a series of failed relationships, estranged children, and hard time to show for everything they've done. Their bleak futures have simply been exchanged for an even grimmer present, and indeed when Marc first sees Spud again, the latter is busy trying to put an end to his own painful existence once and for all. Marc finds he has a reason to be there - to prop up Spud long enough until he can make it on his own - and that leads to an even greater subplot involving Sick Boy (now an owner of an unsuccessful pub) and Begbie (on the run from the cops). I was expecting to be disappointed - sequels - but I loved this. All the members of the original cast were eager to sign on to do this, and it shows in their edgy performances. The characters ring as true as ever and are if anything, done even better in this then the original (and why not? They've all had 20 years to come back round again after all!) A great sequel to one of the best black comedies of the 1990's - if you loved T1, this one is not to be missed.",T2 Trainspotting

I have also read the novel which is the sequel to the original Trainspotting novel, Porno. So I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately it is not a great film. Its very loosely based on Porno. In that it is not at all. The film has been made for fans of the original film. If you haven't seen the original then this film will make little sense. There are nods and flashbacks to the original. However so much time has been spent on referencing the original that they forgot to make a decent film. It doesn't really tell you much about what has been happening to the characters since the original film. It doesn't really wrap up their stories. It really is a bit pointless and a bit of a mess.

It was a cultural master piece, the music, fashion, the poster. Being a film poster designer at the time we were all in ore or how ground breaking & cool that poster was.This is by no means a bad film. I just think it shouldn't have been made.The constant nostalgia references are tedious. Begbie's character is a total parody, so much so that I cringed when ever he was on screen. The soundtrack was easily forgettable too. And why oh why did they have to keep playing remixes of the old tracks? Again, tedious.As for the choose speech, a total cringe festival.They should have made more of the brothel idea.Some films are best left as master pieces. This should have been left to the one film",T2 Trainspotting

Doesn't feel like Boyle/Welsh/etc put in as much work as they did on the first one, and as a result this feels watered down, less calories.The biggest problem is the sloppy abrupt ending. The story falls apart an there's a lot of strands left hanging. Spud and Veronica steal the money? OK... but surely there's going to be consequences? Why aren't we shown the reaction of Sickboy and Renton? The money was a (poorly explained) government grant, so there's presumably going to be a huge investigation into the theft? How do Spud and Veronica expect to get away with it? There's quite a few other plot holes too. Why aren't the police looking for Begbie at the home of his wife and child?!!! Why do Renton and Sickboy casually get into the car of the rival brothel-owner? Doesn't it seem a bit suspicious? What do they intend to do with their project after this encounter? Also if Spud is an excellent forger, why does he have such abysmal hand-writing? Surely you can't forge a signature without learning a little bit of pen control? These aren't big problems, they could be repaired with a couple of extra scenes. Seems lazy.Also the soundtrack is simply not as punchy and ambitious as the first movie.Feels like Trainspotting Lite.",T2 Trainspotting
109,velvoofell,Trainspotting Most Wanted: Age of Ultron,6,28 January 2017,"The Thug/Junkie Avengers in a Time Capsule of Fast Food Pathos.Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting 2' goes all in on a nostalgia ticket and bets everything on that being the reason for audiences wanting to come and see this ""universe"" again. And ""universe"" in the modern Hollywood context is correct as the film has more in common with ensemble superhero movies and the recent 'The Muppets' film than the agitprop storytelling tradition the original was birthed from. As Disney studios own those two cinematic ""properties"", Trainspotting 2 is a ""Disney-fication""Mark Renton returns to the Edinburgh of Trainspotting - not necessarily current Edinburgh - to make his peace with those he robbed and, well, seemingly reacquaint himself with a life of threat and squalor his new middle class life in Holland denies him. Sick Boy is his first port of call and then a visit to a Gollum-esque Spud (Bremner) Essentially, with a prologue scene profiling Begbie's escape from jail, the ""team is getting back together"". Like Avengers or the Muppet film where fan sensibilities pushed Thirnandbthe Hulk or the felt-fabricated puppets together, the invisible ""audience desire"" to see this troupe of thugs and junkies together apparently motivates Renton. The unsteady performances of Miller as Sick Boy and Mcgregor's phoned-in-from- Hollywood Renton, only emphasise that Carlyle and Bremner seem to take their characters to a place of real investment. Even if caricature prevents Spud from being truly sympathetic and Begbie truly scary. The group have to journey to a Glasgow orange lodge for a truly funny scene ending with them nipping back along the M8. There are a collection of entertaining, set-piece moments and sketch-like ideas like this, linked by a slight ""well, what we gonna do next?"" plot that surrealist-satirist modern Scottish comic Limmy would leave on the floor at idea stage. The film's flow is that, though, of a standup comic. And what they could not film comes out in a forced ""choose life"" speech given by Renton in a wine bar. Appropriately for Mcgregor but incongruously for Renton, this is done the way Obi Wan described the Force to Luke. ""Choose Life"" has been invested with such lunch box branding import. Indeed, as Bill Hicks used to ruminate at the end of his shows ""what's the point here, let's find a point!"" The film decides it is Spud's journey that we have been following and he is given his own ""soon-to-be-on-a-t-shirt"" revelation that in life ""there is opportunity then there is a betrayal""Cartoonishly murdered from the original Welsh literary sequel ""Porno"", 'Trainspotting 2' only truly had that as its source and this rushed, fan-serving production although entertaining the way a greatest hits album is, said nothing to me about my (Scottish) life. 'Trainspotting' gleefully sugar coated thug life and despair with the darkest of comedy. 'Trainspotting 2' is a likable but indulgent mess that responds to what the original film became rather than what it was about.",T2 Trainspotting
110,johnplocar,A solid enough sequel to the original.,8,21 May 2017,"I love ""Trainspotting"". I made it pretty late in the game finally getting to see that movie; it wasn't until about 2012-2013 that my best friend at the time showed it to me. When I first saw it I couldn't comprehend it, it was so much all at once to me that I didn't know what to think except that I knew it was special and it stuck with me for quite a while after. Now I've watched it a number of times and I can firmly say that I love it. It's an insane drug odyssey that is dark, surreal, funny, smart, disturbing, unpredictable, inspiring, gorgeous, disgusting, quirky, haunting and just simply amazing. In my opinion, it's easily one of the best films to spawn from the 1990s and even beyond that.After finally seeing this sequel I can comfortably say that it is really good. Maybe not as great as the original, but it is a solid follow-up that I thought was a really enjoyable sit. Don't expect the exact same story again only taking place 20 years later, this does its own thing; and because it does its own thing, also don't expect quite the same tone either. This movie at no point gets quite as dark or as chilling as certain sequences from the first movie. Although it does have its dark and sleazy edge and it works for this movie very well, it's not going to make me have nightmares any time soon. While the first film was a fast paced, drug-fueled nightmare; the sequel is much slower and is somewhat of an allegory for nostalgia and how it can be detrimental reliving old times. The film explores that there is such a thing as looking back at terrible times in a positive light. Especially in terms of what Rent and the gang interpret to be the ""good 'ol times"" since it gets them rolling down some slippery slopes again. Since they can't help but to get caught up in their reunion they find themselves in plenty of hairy situations that sometimes are hilarious and other times intense. Particularly the tense moments come from Robert Carlyle's character, Begbie. Carlyle is absolutely phenomenal in this role just as he was 20 years ago and he does not miss a beat. For me, he completely steals the movie every time he is on screen; he is a madman that is equal parts hilarious and frightening. Yet somehow the film was able to humanize his character a bit with how he is portrayed at failing to relate with his family. There are some pretty great scenes in this movie; such as a chase scene involving Rent and Begbie, or a speech that Rent gives to a new friend in a restaurant about how she should ""choose life"", and the climax that I was really not sure where or how far it was going to go. It has really smart and terrific writing scattered throughout with great acting to match. I was totally on board with following Rent meeting back up with Spud and Sick Boy; or rather 'Simon' as he goes by nowadays. I liked watching these uneasy friendships mold back together again over the course of the movie, yet still remain unpredictable if their loyalties are truly genuine. Rent is specifically being revealed to be dealing with his fair share of woes since his departure and I liked learning more on what he's gone through since leaving his addictions behind for the last 20 years. And it fleshes out his story and the fact that he's hitting somewhat of a 'mid-life' crisis. Coming to the realization that he has to face the music, quite literally, that things aren't the same as they used to be anymore and they never can be, nor should they be. Making his reunion with his old friends feel that much more toxic. In regards to any negatives I may have about this movie, I suppose that it could have cut about 10-15 minutes to make it a tighter narrative. Maybe I think that since the first film is such a tightly edited 90 minutes, so because of that with the sequel being nearly two hours long I felt there were some brief lulls that I wasn't necessarily bored but I was getting eager for it to just get where it was going already. I just believe that some of the places it went didn't particularly add much and could have been cut is all. Aside from that I honestly can't think of anything else wrong with this movie. Maybe I would have liked a bit more closure with some of the characters, but at this point I'm nitpicking.Even though the pace is vastly slower than its predecessor, it still is a fun and pretty quick sit. The acting is all around fantastic, the story handles being a 'nostalgic' sequel astonishingly well and clever, the cinematography and direction is stylish as with most of Danny Boyle's films are. Although this film doesn't have exactly the same style as the first, it does have flares of its spirit and plays with that in parts. This movie has a good amount of heart, largely provided by the Spud character, to go along with its cautionary themes about ""bad nostalgia"". This movie hit a lot of the right notes for me and I think it's worth checking out. Do I think it's on the same level as the first ""Trainspotting""? No, I don't think I can go that far; at least not at this time. But I still recommend it for being smart, funny, interesting, heartfelt, entertaining and is easily one of the better films I've seen so far this year. If you love the first film then I think you'll enjoy this one as well. Just don't expect much retreading here.",T2 Trainspotting
111,BillSims28,"Wittily recaptures the spirit of the original, though sometimes unoriginal",7,19 February 2019,"90s classic 'Trainspotting' is easily the greatest film to star both Ewan McGregor and a dead baby. This solid homage picks up 20 years later, in an increasingly globalised Edinburgh, checking in with all the old favourite characters. It may not bring much new to the table, but it's certainly won't disappoint fans of the original and is often a riotously entertaining time.Returning screenwriter John Hodge's script is brimming with wit and as sharp as ever, balancing some pitch black humour with moments of tender drama. There are genuinely hilarious sequences, including the standout Catholic song scene. The biting satire of its 1996 predecessor is also still evident, especially in the incisive updated 'choose life' monologue.It's clear from the delicate intimacy with which he explores the central characters that Danny Boyle still has a lot of passion for this world. Jonny Lee Miller is a highlight amongst the cast and has a lot more to do this time, able to explore the 'Simon' side of his character as well as the 'Sick Boy'. McGregor is still wonderfully versatile and Robert Carlyle his same snarling deranged self, whilst Ewen Bremner is the film's primary source of pathos as the earnest Spud.Aside from the iconic principal quartet, Anjela Nedyalkova has a large role but is not quite as developed as she could have been, nor are many of the other supporting characters. This is visible in other aspects of the film as well: it is heavily reliant on the original, and often derivative of it. In total though, it's an enjoyable time. 70/100.",T2 Trainspotting

The boys have grown up now, but still find themselves more or less doing what they did back then. You have to love how Ewan McGregor and Jonny Lee Miller did not seem to have aged, but I think the biggest surprise was Robert Carlyle's character, Begbie, who once again showed beyond doubt to be the powerhouse of the group.I found myself going back to rewind several scenes from the movie. One of the scenes involved Begbie chasing Rent Boy who was hanging by the roof of a car while ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was playing heavily in the background. That's when I saw Boyle's touch of class and I knew in that moment I was watching a master at work. The camerawork with the car's side mirror and the frenetic close-ups were just on par in that scene.The editing was great as in all of Danny Boyle's films, especially the scenes were they guys were tripping on drugs, a very good use of lenses and projectors.""T2 Trainspotting"" is a sequel that had to be made and it turned out fantastic.

Nothing really exciting happens and everything feels old and already done. There's so many flashbacks to the original Trainspotting that the movie almost doesn't feel original.

T R A I N S P O T T I N G (2017)The sequel to the original masterpiece of a film 'Trainspotting' (1996) by master filmmaker Danny Boyle, this is a great film too. Full of nostalgia, surrealism, awesome-awesome music and 'masterclass' performances by all the actor. This is a MUST WATCH film.I do not know why but I kept getting emotional and teary eyed watching this film. Set literally in a small part of the world in Scotland, it is full of human emotions that chokes you. 'Spud' trying to commit suicide really did me! How empty and hopeless he was feeling was superbly conveyed by Ewen Bremmer, his expressions, his body language, his eyes, the odd way he spoke, everything about his performance is out of the world.'Begbie' played by Robert Carlyle is the 2nd most amazing performance in the film according to me. 'Begbie' is a beast, you look at him and you get scared. Even if he is in a good mood, you'd be scared. And this is because of how he is played by Robert. But then in the pre- climax we suddenly see him in a totally different light for say a minute and you are suddenly drawn to his insecurities and inferiority complexes, you realise, you come to know why he is the way he is. His last interaction with his son makes you understand and makes you believe that there is still a little bit of a human being alive in this beast. Amazing, amazing performance!Ewan McGregor as 'Renton' and Logan Gillies as 'Simon' really didn't have much to do, they were efficient in what they did. Their characters were quite simple and not much was required from them 'performance wise'.Anjela Nedyalkova as 'Veornica' was a delight to watch and she was also very efficient with her performance. Again she didn't have much to do!Danny Boyle on the other hand has everything to do with this film. He has managed to create magic in this film. Cinematic Magic with touching human emotions and a warm, fuzzy feeling of nostalgia. For some reason I was really able to relate with all the characters, I could understand and see their angst and psychology and see the reasons and logics for their actions perfectly. And all of it made sense.I loved how Danny used surrealism in this film, he did the same and much better in the first film, but still the magic was there. Great music, great cinematography and superb editing has made this one of my most fav films immediately.My ratings: 9/10 ********* MUST WATCH!!!!",T2 Trainspotting
119,DJKwa,The long gestation has produced a more mature and effective sequel,8,19 March 2017,"Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie are back! Twenty years after bailing on his friends and running away with their money, Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns home to Edinburgh after a stint of normal life as an accountant in Amsterdam. Ready to face the music from his old friends, Renton finds that while some things have changed since his departure, most has largely stayed the same. The opening reintroduces the characters by way of a 'Where Are They Now?' sort of reveal that, by focusing on the characters individually, splits the narrative into a bunch of different subplots. Spud (Ewen Bremner) is still struggling with a heroin addiction. Simon AKA Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) has extended his con artistry to black mail, recording staged trysts with his Bulgarian girlfriend and extorting targets with the salacious footage. And what about Begbie (Robert Carlyle) and his violent temper? Well he's in prison, of course. Juggling each of the characters' narrative threads proves a little too unwieldy and the film sags at times in contrast to the tightly packed original film, which also had a leaner and more energised 90 minute running time. It's only in the second half when Begbie escapes from prison and plans to exact revenge on Renton that the narrative achieves a forward momentum that comes close to matching the wild, unfettered spirit of the original film.While the sequel lacks the madcap energy of fleeting youth that the original 1996 film possessed, it trades it off for a more world-weary maturity. The junkie, slacker lifestyle dies hard and with the characters now middle-aged, there's pervasive cynicism at the heart of the film. What was once youthful frivolity has metamorphosed into a state of arrested development and the film ruminates on the dangers of living in the past. When the crew return to the Scottish highlands to remember their fallen compadre, Tommy, Renton says that they are there as an act of remembrance. Simon on the other hand doesn't see it the same way. ""Nostalgia, that's why you're here!"" He retorts. ""You're a tourist in your own youth."" The message is clear for these perennial drifters, fraudsters and addicts; as long as they cling to the past they'll never be able to truly grow up. It's a mature outlook that feels like a direct result of the film's long gestation. So perhaps the two decade wait was intentional as Trainspotting 2 is all the better for it.",T2 Trainspotting
120,CinemaCocoa,"Lacking a voice of its own, T2 is a nostalgic love letter only",6,13 April 2017,"More of a nostalgic love letter to an industry shaking movie of the 90s than anything powerful in its own right.Mark Renton, clean of drugs for twenty years, returns to Scotland in a bid to reconnect with his old friends and unsurprisingly finds them all as awkward and deprived as they had always been.While Irvine Welsh's book Trainspotting had sequels (no, I've not read any of them) it comes as something of a surprise that a sequel to 1996's ground-breaking British adaptation would arrive now. Certainly, it is one thing one cannot shake when watching Danny Boyle and the returning cast's new endeavour; is it all too late? The bid to recapture lightning in a bottle is something Hollywood at large is desperate for these days: Star Wars, Jurassic Park, the wayward Ghostbusters and Terminator franchises, all determined to relive the creative spontaneity of the late eighties and nineties. One would have thought Boyle and co. having created such a controversial movie back then wouldn't succumb to the same ethos. Sadly, at its worst, the perplexingly titled ""T2 – Trainspotting"" (can I please just call it Trainspotting 2?) is nothing more than a wandering, convenient, self-indulgent nostalgia trip, containing little to nothing of the tone or theme the original relished so darkly within. The realisation of this occurs when Renton (Ewan McGregor) just starts on a revised monologue on ""Chose Life"", completely left-field, unprovoked, middle of the film, not internalised and including an explanation on why he did the monologue in the first film. No! No, you are ruining the magic! The overall story doesn't feel as tight as before. It wanders and characters commit to things, do things and say things that should surely have consequences (and certainly would have in the original's intense realism) but apparently coast through it all without concern.With a soundtrack not living up to the original's (or even Boyle's own reputation) you are probably thinking: ""Wow, Cinema Cocoa did not like this movie!"" right about now. It is more a disappointment. I would have liked more on these characters and their struggles with modern life; to see a perspective of Scotland and Britain in the new millennium. I think I counted one or two fractions of scenes that addressed this, but in no way was it a overarching theme. It is still a well made movie. Totally reliant on working knowledge of the original film, regardless of its flashbacks to old footage, but the actors are having a blast here. Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller probably steal the show, while Ewen Bremner is also having the time of his life as Spud. In fact the only one who seems to be coasting a little is McGregor, but playing the literal straight man isn't the most exciting material. In fact perhaps the most grounded and compelling moments come from Bremner and Carlyle unexpectedly! It did get a lot of laughs and does have some memorable moments scattered throughout (especially a scene involving the year 1690, that's all I will say!)But one cannot shake the notion that in twenty years time, Trainspotting 2 will not be considered a milestone in cinema history, certainly not for British film history. Compared to its predecessor, this film plays it remarkably safe! Whether this is due to desensitisation or not it is hard to tell, but it feels like all of 1996's controversy has been sucked out, changing what was once a drug-fueled riot into an nostalgia-powered, almost morose, revenge movie.Big fans of Trainspotting will appreciate seeing these characters return and the memories it lavishly and deliberately pulls up, but if you have no knowledge of the history then you will probably find it a funny film but little more. Personally, I wanted it to be more impactful; I wanted it to be socially challenging and gut-wrenching like the original, as much as I enjoyed seeing the energy these actors still have!",T2 Trainspotting

The acting is generally very good with the 4 main actors putting in a decent performance but the situations the characters get into are just silly and devalue the film overall.The T2 rarely gets to the heights of the original film, it lacks bite apart from the 'choose life' scene, which stands out for all the right reasons and has the feel of a film I would really want to see.The score of the original film is a classic and T2 very much takes its cues from the original, it feels nostalgic but feels slightly lacking some how.I may be being rather harsh on T2 Trainspotting.

125,Marthian80,Excellent sequel to the classic 90's hit,8,27 February 2017,"When I heart a sequel was being made to one of my favorite movies, I was a bit skeptical. The original Trainspotting had a great ending, with the four friends going their separate ways. But then I saw the trailer, saw some positive reviews and I got more curious. Turns out this is a very entertaining and well-made movie.The movie opens with introducing where the four main characters are now, twenty years later. We see Begbie (Robert Carlyle) still in jail and although he's gotten old, he has lost none of his fiery temper. Spud (Ewen Bremner) tried to quit the junkie life and live a decent citizen life but he keeps falling back to his old habits and cannot even keep track of daylight savings (because when you're on smack, who cares about daylight savings?). Simon / Sick Boy (John Lee Miller) lives a chaotic life of light criminal activities, has traded heroine for cocaine and tries to get a relation going with a young Bulgarian girl named Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova). And finally we meet Mark (Ewan McGregor) again who lived in Amsterdam for the past twenty years and decides to go back to the only place he can call home. He goes to see his old palls Spud and Simon, but can they forgive him for running off with the money twenty years ago? And can he still connect with them and call them friends after all these years? This movie is all about the characters, and they did a very good job at giving these four people twenty years more content. With the first movie in mind, you could easily see that these characters ended up where they are now. The actors also have a lot more experience now and it really shows. I was impressed with both Ewen Bremner and John Lee Miller portraying their roles as Spud and Simon respectively. While Spud is still the focus of most of the humor, he also brings a lot of drama to his role now and does that very well. I personally liked Robert Carlyle better in the first movie, but he still has some great moments where the old hot tempered Begbie shines. McGregor was outstanding in the original but while he does a good job, he was not outstanding in this one. But perhaps that is more because the rest of the cast was so great. The film also looks gorgeous and is filled with flashbacks to the original that blend over very well in present time. There are lots of hilarious scenes (the 1690 Battle of the Boyne remembrance party is my favorite) and subtle nods to the original (a disgusting toilet in a club for example). The soundtrack of this movie is also fantastic, with excellent present time music, a few old tracks and a few remixes of iconic songs from the first film. Finally I like how this movie holds a mirror to everyone who grew up with the original. What have you been up to for the past twenty years? Do you get on with the times or are you still stuck in the past? Do you also keep talking about how great life was in the 80's/90's to millennials? The movie tackles present time issues also, and I loved Renton's updated 'choose life' speech: 'choose Twitter, Snap-chat, Instagram and Facebook. Post a picture of your breakfast and hope that someone, somewhere, cares'.This movie is definitely a must see for everyone who grew up with the original, but also with enough material to keep the new generation glued to the screen.",T2 Trainspotting
126,dsalouk,Comes blazing right out of the gate non-stop,10,18 February 2017,"T2 Trainspotting is everything the original was, and more. From the kick-start, it comes out with an incredible soundtrack, perfectly synced to a number of perfectly created shots to bring life to an environment of wretchedness, lingering since the first. 20 years on, T2 follows the same characters and their lingering personalities, still dwelling on the past. Stuck in the grey drudgery of Edinburgh, the audience is invited to life in the pub, in the club, at home, with friends, past lovers, past hobbies. Only to be lead to new homes, new lovers, new hobbies, new ventures, and crazy escapades, all wonderfully providing nods to the original. Glorious are the days when the same cast and director come back to breath life into a seemingly ongoing project. Danny Boyle not only recreates the magic, but creates some truly inspiring scenes brought to a pinnacle point with the help of Ewan Mcgregor and Robert Carlyle. Carlyle's character is truly an intimidating figure, bent on revenge and chaos. He epitomizes the short fuse, ready to blow at a moment's touch.T2 Trainspotting is awe-inspiring, grungy, intriguing, and to a tone of constant excitement. Rather than focus on the themes of drug abuse, it diverts to betrayal, friendship, and all that goes with it. The film is a rare delight, guns blazing the whole way right up to the end.",T2 Trainspotting
127,ronin1138,Ewen Bremner steals it,7,21 July 2017,"Twenty years ago Trainspotting presented characters you responded to in equal measures of liking, disgust or humour. But it was Spud that resonated most strongly with me, just felt sorry for him like he was the real victim. This new film its the same but somehow more so. Ewen Bremner's Spud is such a sad and pathetic creature but likable. His biggest weakness is his naivity and how Ewen breathes Spud is an acting masterclass.Good film.",T2 Trainspotting

130,joshteggert,Danny Boyle and co. are back and on top form with a superbly worthwhile sequel to a film you thought never needed one,9,8 February 2017,"21 years after Renton (Ewan McGregor) walked away with a heap of cash taken from his closest friends, Spud (Ewen Bremmer), Begbie (Robert Carlyle) and Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), the tensions couldn't be higher on screen. The same can also be said, more relevantly, for the cast and crew: too often have we seen solid standalones ruined by their cash grabbing, flimsy sequels recently, but ""T2: Trainspotting"" recaptures the flare of the original and crafts it into something fresh and exciting, whilst still attentively rooted to the foundations of the previous cult-classic.Most importantly, ""T2"" tackles the inevitability of aging fantastically. The greatest fear leading up to the release of this highly anticipated sequel was that Boyle would desperately try to cling on to the generation-defining youthful buzz of ""Trainspotting"". Whilst that same thrill is remarkably present in this film, the acknowledgment that everything has changed is arguably ""T2""'s greatest strength; Boyle never relies excessively on ""Trainspotting""'s success and provides us with a wonderfully creative sequel, similar in construct with the original, but assured in its own right.The characters excellently embrace the time gap as well. Spud is by far the most compelling of the four as the narrative unfolds, despite them all having their own respective standout moments. Bremmer charmingly transforms his vulnerable character into one that we find ourselves entranced by as the film develops, which is credible also to John Hodge's magnetic screenplay, loosely adapting Irvine Welsh's 2002 sequel ""Porno"". Hodge expands the way in which the audience perceives each character as he did in the original, shamelessly exposing their flaws and then immediately contrasting them with each person's more pleasant aspects.This does however result in a slightly mixed tone at times, for example, Begbie is constantly shifting from comic relief to villain. Furthermore, the female characters from the original are neglected, and while Anjela Nedyalkova's enigmatic performance as Veronika in this film partially compensates for this female absence, the film does suffer because of this. Although, ""T2"" makes it clear that this story is all about exploring the longstanding friendships of the four now middle-aged men and how their time apart has impacted their dynamic when Renton suddenly returns. ""First there was an opportunity and then there was a betrayal""; a phrase that spurs the plot along loosely throughout. The way in which the characters feelings regarding this statement is sound, with the relationships as complicated as one would expect, yet also relatable in terms of the justification behind each character's personal approach to dealing with the mess that Renton left behind.It is not as sharp or forceful as the first film, but it is certainly the ideal sequel to it. It won't be as era characterising as the original either, but ""T2"" is worthwhile in every sense, an impressive and hugely enjoyable instalment from Danny Boyle.",T2 Trainspotting
131,ben06,"Choose life, choose not to watch this movie....",3,15 May 2019,"First this is nothing like how the book lays it out... The unbelievably stupid part of the plot begins with a now clean and fit Mark Renton falling off a treadmill then casually and fearlessly heading back to Scotland from Amsterdam to drop in on the people he ripped off to pay them back...
They forgive him almost immediately after 20 years and he tells them that he's getting divorced, and he foresees himself getting made redundant from a company he has been in for 20 years (just like that) also, apparently after 20 years there's noone else who he can hang out with but these guys and no other job he can do.Somehow Simon and Renton then go onto a scheme of pickpocketing an entire pub in a bid to steal debit cards where everyone has the same pin number then get money for a brothel that Simon wants to run oh yeah they also end up singing.Moving onto one of the main characters. Begbie. Who somehow is stabbed straight through the liver in prison is taken to hospital and then walks casually out while headbutting a doctor in full view of everyone in Broad daylight then tries to reunite with his family and rope his drip of a son who is doing a diploma to become his accomplice in crime.Plot then gets even more ridiculous when Simon needs a lawyer for getting busted for extortion they end up gaining an audience with business investors and giving an amazing speech despite Simon having a criminal record and being under investigation for extortion and Mark not being in the country for 20 years.Moving on they then after commemorating Tommy for dying of heroin decide to regress back onto the same drug that ruined their lives and which they had kicked for 20 years subsequently end up in a nightclub, all of this despite Renton having a new pacemaker in his heart.Begbie, of course being nearly 60 is also in this nightclub and winds up pulling within minutes of walking of in and heads in the same toilets as Renton to pop viagra... I mean you couldn't make it up.... Ended up turning it off before throwing my laptop out the window... Choose life... Choose not to watch this film..The plots just wildy unbelievable and ridiculous and pretty much rubbish.",T2 Trainspotting
132,sprichnichtzumir,Heartwarming,10,23 December 2020,"This movie is pure love. The atmosphere and narrative feels very different compared to the first movie but not in a bad way. In the first movie, the main subject was drug addiction and the things it does to people, in this one is friendship over time and nostalgia. The characters are just perfect, I've never seen characters like this before, they're not so impressive, they're just very original. The soundtrack feels good, the ending is great, the action scenes are well done. The story it's just okay, but still, this is 100% recommended.",T2 Trainspotting
133,jcdugger,"Great movie, but...",8,5 May 2017,"Making a sequel to the unique and very original Trainspotting was never going to be an easy task. Danny Boyle and the team did a great job with it for the most part though, terrible name (T2) aside of course. It ""felt"" like Trainspotting and they had many of the old characters back. How they inserted quick shots/scenes from the original was poignant and well done. Overall, I'm glad they made the movie and it will be a welcome addition to my Blu-Ray collection. However, I did have some issues with the final product...Before I begin, I'd like to remind you I gave this a 8 out of 10...it is also a unique movie like the original and I certainly enjoyed watching it. Though I must say, I do wish the movie had a different story-line and had left out a few implausible scenes/situations. Maybe this stuff is in the book Porno and they wanted to follow that, I'm not sure. But I can't help but be disappointed by the direction to movie took in a lot of ways, despite giving it a 8. (Spoilers ahead). For instance, they had Begbie escape from prison at the beginning...after losing out on his parole. Why not just parole him and send him on his way into the public? Instead, they go through a ridiculous scenario in which Begbie escapes a crowded hospital by doing the old and tired ""knocking someone out in the hallway and switching clothes with him off-screen"" routine...something that I'm sure has never actually worked in human history beyond movies and TV. On top of all this, the cops never even check the house where his wife and kid live, as Begbie easily shacks up there. Also, the cop who was watching him while in his hospital bed must take the longest #2's his side of the Pacific Ocean! Begbie talks the cop into leaving him un-handcuffed while the cop goes to take a duke...then apparently before the hospital is put into lock-down by cop who wouldn't have been gone longer than 15 minutes, Begbie un-tethers himself to all the wires he's hooked up to, he roams the halls looking for a spot that is empty so he can knock someone out, knocks that person out, removes and changes clothes with his limp body (would be a very time-consuming task, especially while one person is limp and the other is injured), then casually walks out...all before the cop is done with an on-duty #2?! Come on. Then later Begbie (in an implausible way) meets Renton - who's a runner in his off-time now - and a foot-chase begins. The much older-looking Begbie, who's just coming off a 20-year stint in the clink while the younger Renton has been training this whole time, somehow keeps up with Renton during the long chase. He then stabs Renton in the arm. This arm gets no attention the rest of the way, despite what looked to be a pretty serious injury...he's fine the next scene. All of this should have been re-written. Which leads me to Spud. Spud, if you haven't seen the movie, is no longer the happy-go-lucky Spud...he's suicidal and becomes, get this, an author! Whatttt?! Again, a re-write here would have been preferred. And, also, now Sick Boy has a coke problem but doesn't do heroin anymore. Trainspotting was kind of about, you know, heroin! 3 of the 4 barely even mention it anymore...they do more coke and drinking than anything...and by the end, none of the 4 are hooked in any sort of way. Spud seemed to drop his 25+ year habit after a long jog and a nice talk. Why did the filmmakers decide on the unnecessary and unlikely change of heart towards the characters and heroin? This is Trainspotting!What should have been done instead? I think Renton should have came back because he ran into a illegal money-making situation like his mates did with Mikey Forrester 20 years earlier. Maybe a plan to rob a warehouse where he somehow found out heroin was being stored there. He would decide to come back to town and meet up with the three old mates and relieve his guilt, offering them a deal where they make up the 4000 pounds plus a heck of a lot more in exchange for their forgiveness. This would have been a great start to a fun sort of story (fun like Trainspotting was fun to watch). And you could have ended it a million different exciting ways. Instead there is a lot of depression and regret and guilt by the characters and it weighed down the fun factor in my opinion.Overall, I was just so glad to see the old characters back. And despite the flaws, it's an interesting movie to watch, an alternate sort of take to Trainspotting. It's a really good movie that really could have been a great one with a little better script.JD",T2 Trainspotting
134,noirink-12054,it's all right,7,2 March 2017,"It is nice to see the Boys after such a long time together again. I was never expecting that this sequel exceeds its predecessor. It could have been a good movie with some nostalgic moments.But I was very off put with the constant flashbacks and reminders on all those famous scenes from part one. Why? Whas the director afraid the movie would not stand out enough without them? Off course I liked to see some occasional nods to trainspotting one, but for my taste they where way to much and they robbed the film its own right to stand for it self. More: They gave the movie some odd cheapish moments. Sometimes it looked that the movie rather likes to swim in self-references than telling the actual story.And in my case that was exactly the reason why I went to this movie. I wanted to see how Spud, Renton, Sick Boy and Franco evolved and how the movie tells us their story further. I saw the first Trainspotting a dozen times, I do not need a constant reminder how cool it was.It's a sequel with some witty moments, good actors and I had a nice time but it also has no real memorable moments to me.",T2 Trainspotting
135,jsmith98-1,"A Good Sequel, But Hard To Live Up To The Original.",6,30 March 2019,"This is a good sequel but it doesn't live up to the first movie. It's supposed to be 20 years from where the original movie left off. The problem is that this movie is not as emotionally charged as the first movie. I just didn't get that ""appalling, stomach churning cringe"" factor from the sequel that I got from the first movie. The original movie was so good that it was hard to watch. There where many moments in the original movie were I felt like I was going to have to get up and leave the theater. In my opinion, any move that I can't stop watching, no matter how hard it is to watch, makes for a great film. The disgusting scenes are apparent to those who have watched the first installment of this series. There are many scenes in the original movie that should be enough to keep anyone from getting hooked on heroin or other opioids that cause withdrawals and are generally injected.T2 is not by any means a terrible film, but just okay. The soundtracks for both of these titles are outstanding to those of us who are ""Gen-Xers""! I didn't see this one in the theater, but purchased it when it came out on Blu-Ray. I don't feel it's a waste of time, but you need to watch the first movie to get the idea of how much these two movies are different from one another. I also feel it doesn't live up to the original movie as it doesn't make me get that, ""I can't stop watching this, but I feel like I want too"" feeling that the first movie gave me.The first movie in this series made me feel a wide range of emotions that I didn't know that I had the ability to feel from watching a movie. They ranged from absolute disgust, to feeling nausea, to depression. It's a great movie as it is extremely hard to watch, but you can't stop watching it no matter how hard as you try. I've seen my fair share of drug usage and I'm not in the least bit naive about the consequences of real life addiction. But the fact that this first movie was so hard to watch is why I feel it is a lot better than the sequel in my opinion.",T2 Trainspotting

The gritty style of Danny Boyle retains its presence in the movie, however T2 looks so much more pleasing and become a heart-warming feature, even though the disgusting world of drugs and addiction still remains, the film now shows it in a completely different style, highlighting different values across the characters and that even the scummiest of them can redeem themselves through life.The Film begins with our well known protagonist, Mark Renton, as he returns to the origin of the first film - Edinburgh. The stunning city visuals, shining from a new light, are almost incomparable to the gritty Edinburgh in the 90s, however the characters still manage to find the places and areas where everything took place beforehand. Deciding to visit his old friends Simon and Stud, Renton gets himself into a tricky situation, realising that even though he was missed, his friends do not think of him highly after he left them to suffer, stealing most of the money from their drug job back in the 96'.The film introduces new characters, but mostly focuses on the old and the original characters, who bring back the nostalgia of 20 years having gone by. Although Mark looks as though he has a better life and its' all for the best, he too is still messed up, as are all of our other characters.The new iteration of Trainspotting is a lot more aesthetically pleasing to watch, as the shots follow the precise rule of thirds and show well-made stylistics, retaining the gritty style of Boyle's original Trainspotting (1996) and yet bringing in so much more with the information that is given to us. Even though it is still a hostile film about the harsh realities of life and drug addiction, the film does not intend to alarm the viewer all the way throughout.",T2 Trainspotting

140,gricey_sandgrounder,It's as if they never left,8,27 January 2017,"Sequels long after its original is always risky business. Especially one that I did not think needed it. But director Danny Boyle is back with a follow-up to one of the most influential British films of all-time.I had only seen Trainspotting for the first time several years ago. I remember being quite impressed by it, despite me never going nuts for drug-related films. I was more interested by the style of film- making and well developed characters. It also contain one of the most distressing scenes I have seen in any film.21 years later, and now we see where the lads are now. I saw the trailer to see if it's going to be worth it, and I was surprised how good it looked. Some of the dialogue I was hearing sounded like we were instantly back in this mad environment. With the trailer doing plenty to get me intrigued, I had pretty solid hopes for a worth sequel.Amazingly, I felt it managed to all come together. For something that I'm sure Boyle holds very dearly to his heart, you would expect him to never go near this work again. Especially when he has never done a sequel before. But we are now here, and I think everyone did a grand job. I did not get the sense that the makers made this for an easy box office return. I felt it was there to be an actual follow-up to the events from 1996, which is fantastic to see. The tone is definitely being aimed at the people who grew up with the original. With that in mind, it will be interesting to see how it works to the generation that are of the age the cast were in the original, and see if it can relate to a broad age range.The gang are back, and all four of them were great in their performances. Honestly, it was like they had never left. Ewan McGregor holds the film well as Renton, has many strong moments and you can tell he is enjoying getting back in the saddle. Roberty Carlyle continues to be as hilarious as Begbie was back in the day. Ewen Bremner as Spud shines the most for me, was given great development and became such a pivotal part of this sequel. I was really surprised to see Johnny Lee Miller give a great performance, as it is only recently that he has got back into movie acting after being busy with a TV series.Another thing some sections of the audience like to see with sequels, is the level of nostalgia. The use of that and memory was cleverly done. It felt like it meant something, instead of just making us think ""I'd rather be watching the original"".I have only very minor negatives. There were moments that felt a bit scattered at times and did not feel that well connected to the main story.I was not expecting this to be so enjoyable. Boyle and his done have done a great job by keeping this a down-to-earth story and making feel like it deserves a second installment. I think what the films big strengths are, is what made the original so successful. The characters are still as memorable as ever, the writing is sharp and funny when needed, the visuals are engrossing and impactful, and the soundtrack is strong. They also managed to make the film worth seeing for people who haven't even seen the original, which was impressive to see.When you think about it, a lot of Danny Boyle's work is about friendship, and this one is no different. I will continue to be excited for his next project, after making what will probably one of the big surprises of 2017. What a start to the year!Rating: 8/10",T2 Trainspotting

I loved the first movie and it was exciting to see all the characters back on the big screen and it really felt like each actor hadn't missed a beat with each of their respective characters, especially Robert Carlyle who is incredible as Begbie. I'm glad Spud received a bit more of a focus in this movie as I really do Ewen Bremner and everything he brings to these movies. I felt T2 delivered more on the comedy side of things as there was some well scripted dialogue that kept you chuckling but the first Trainspotting was a lot darker and grittier and quite a bit of that wasn't transferred to the sequel, a great watch nevertheless.",T2 Trainspotting

143,showmethemoviescontact,T2 Trainspotting,6,10 February 2017,"An immensely challenging sequel to produce; Danny Boyle's reprisal was never going to satisfy old fans and newcomers alike.After twenty years, there would be obvious ambiguity in how to go about writing and directing this cult-classics' sequel. 2017 is brimming with sequels of both original movies and installments to well-established series; thus this may be a recurring issue in the near future. T2 Trainspotting is very clearly a movie made for the fans of the original, for people who loved the first film but haven't watched it in years, and have fond memories of it. This film preys upon the fact that some people will be so wound up in their own nostalgia that they won't give this film the independence from the original it needed.T2 struggles to declare itself a story of its own; literal scenes from the original Trainspotting are shown to portray a reflection on the past repeating itself; but all that this shows is an unwillingness to write a completely original plot. It is likely Danny Boyle did this to appease fans, as going in a completely different direction would then annoy those who are devoted to the first film.The story has a great premise; the Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns to Scotland and meets with the lovable Spud (Ewen Bremner) and best-pal Simon (Jonny Lee Miller) once again - much to their initial disgust. Not long after, the return of Begbie (Robert Carlyle) fills the plot with more drama than a soap opera. The events that take place are mostly for comedic purpose, under the premise that the audience already know the characters (fair to assume, but not taking into account standalone viewers). A specific scene in which Simon and Mark are forced to perform a song in a loyalist pub had me laughing out loud in the cinema; so often the attempts at making the film light- hearted were received with a good response.That being said, one of the things about the original is that it wasn't light hearted in the slightest. The characters were the only thing lovable about the film, not what happened to them necessarily, whereas T2 swaps this around - the environments were far more ostentatious in this film, bright neon lighting and fewer disgusting and dull backdrops make for a more optimistic view in this film - quite the opposite of what the original was about. It seems in trying to appease the fans of the original and placing the same characters in a repetitive-yet more flamboyant setting has managed to stray from the roots of what made Trainspotting great.T2 could have been set anywhere provided the main characters still acted in the way that they do, and that's a shame - every piece of Trainspotting was necessary to put together the plot that was made.Despite all of this - T2 is a good film. It's not a great film, but it certainly isn't awful either. Its' greatest failing is that it can't decide whether to create an entirely new story - which would abandon the roots of the original - or to re-hash Trainspotting - which would be total cowardice. The film does the worst of both worlds, in that it doesn't have a great deal of original thought but it also doesn't capture what the first film did. On its own merits, T2 is a funny film; and it is enjoyable to watch. I didn't leave the theatre as disappointed as I would have anticipated, and the film didn't fail to put a smile on my face during. Despite the 20 year gap, the actors clearly haven't lost track of their alter-ego's nature - the performances were great and the chemistry that the actors had was immense, with a gleaming nod to Robert Carlyle.I can still say I recommend T2, its not like the original in terms of quality or theme, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. I can make an odd comparison to another sequel, Aliens, in that both T2 and Aliens are very enjoyable, but both films also spoil the point of their predecessor in a sense.",T2 Trainspotting

I'm glad I did as although there are flashbacks in T2 I think you need to be very familiar with the original to get it.I was worried they would be treading old ground or it just wouldn't live up to the reputation of the original.

Its there's any fairness in the world Ewan Bremner will get a supporting actor nomination - hes great.This film doesn't shock in the same way as the original - but it doesn't try to shock for the sake of it. Its full of humour - its really quite funny. There was lots of laughter in the cinema.Its well made. Fast paced. Heart warming.

145,movieguy96,A walk on the wild side of soul-searching,10,25 July 2020,"Whilst not the irrefutable classic that the first film was, I do think T2: Trainspotting is in some ways superior, chiefly for its psychological themes. It serves as a poignant mediation on life and wasted potential, as compared the original where it was more about capturing the zeitgeist of 90's rave culture and drug epidemic amongst the disenfranchised youth. Now we see our protagonists as mere shadows of their former selves, chewed up and spat out, not necessarily as a result of society but by their own vices; their addictive 'live fast die young' lifestyles having caught up with a vengeance. The abuse they've inflicted on themselves are made all the more evident and tragic by age. They physically look ravaged by time, left pondering on what was, and what could have been. Indeed, one of the best lines in the movie comes where Sick Boy tells Renton that he's a tourist in his own youth. All through the movie the tormented characters struggle to reconcile with their feelings of guilt and resentment.Director Danny Boyle and scriptwriter John Hodges wisely sidestepped the temptation of having the boys team up for another drug deal, or some far-fetched contrived storyline which would've only served for dramatic purposes. Indeed, T2: Trainspotting is way more theme-driven than plot-driven; there's virtually no plot to speak of, apart from something to do with Renton and Sick Boy attempting to convert an old dilapidated pub into a brothel as part of some 'get rich quick' scheme. This isn't a criticism though, and it's obviously intentional to put more focus on the characters. Whilst Trainspotting didn't glorify the excesses of drug use, its juxtaposition with the beating vibe of the 90's club scene reminds us of the temporary highs that come with it, such the euphoria and the sex and arrogance of youth. Fast forward to the present, and what was then 'cool' now seems so distant and immaterial, our 'heroes' doomed to live with the repercussions of their own failures and foolishness.Each of the characters are forced to confront their own demons through the course of the movie, something which up till now they've tried desperately to suppress. It's this spiritual journey, rather than anything literal, which makes T2: Trainspotting linger in the memory more than the first film, and it's credit to Boyle/Hodges that they've lost none of their verve in letting that unfold.The prominent alt-rock/indie pop soundtrack (coupled with the vividly visceral direction) lends itself perfectly to the angry disillusionment which our characters find themselves lost in. There was one critic who criticised the ""choose life"" scene as not being as effective as its use in the first movie, something which I completely disagree with. We see Renton in a swanky restaurant surrounded by the material wealth of charlatans who have, on the face of it, accomplished something with their lives and seem perfectly happy conforming to societies expectations. Renton then launches into a increasingly emotional breakdown of his disappointment with life; the superficial irony of todays society taking a backseat to the futility of his own rebellious youth. As the speech goes on we see the raw emotion as he contemplates what he himself has accomplished and his existential torment. This is a stark contrast to Renton's voice-over in the first movie, Iggy Pop blaring in the background. He had arrogance on his side then, committing morally reprehensible crimes, and on the run from the authorities, but we cheer him on nonetheless. It's the contrast between these scenes which typifies why I feel T2: Trainspotting has a more profound effect overall.The entire cast is commendable but it's probably Robert Carlyle's Begbie that leaves the most lasting impression. He takes more centre-stage here, and if possible seems even more monstrous than in the first film. The years of incarceration have festered feelings of unresolved hatrid towards Renton. He has the look of a brute, someone consumed with pure spite and frustration; a toxic menace to everyone he encounters. In the end he almost reaches something of an epiphany, making peace with his family before facing a destiny of his own making. He knows what he is, and what he always will be (something made clear when he tells his son not to follow in his footsteps). Carlyle displays these different facets to his character with alarming authenticity.The most impressing thing with T2: Trainspotting is that its tonally spot-on. We know the characters are almost beyond redemption, but yet it's tragic without being maudlin and dull. In fact it's more comical than Trainspotting, pointing out the absurdities of their lives as they continue to fumble while somehow attempting to redeem themselves. It's like a quirky character study. Eventually, everyone ends up virtually where they were at the start (or in a clearly better place, in Spud's case), only this time there's no false pretensions about where they're heading. There's a certain sense of optimism in that.",T2 Trainspotting

147,Luke_was_a_terrorist,20 years worth the wait...,8,17 June 2017,"Most sequels, especially nowadays, are made more for an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the original rather than being made because there is another genuine story to tell with these characters. This is not the case for Trainspotting 2, this story most definitely falls in the latter.Trainspotting is one of my all time top 5 favorite movies, and I have waited 20 years to SEE a sequel. I was hyped but skeptical when they announced it, as sequels nowadays tend to be pretty bad. But Danny Boyle and the original cast have done something really special, they have come up with a near perfect reunion and goodbye for these characters. Blending the (literary sequel) ""Porno"" into it and not making it into a direct adaptation was the smart move (just as giving the original movie a clearer narrative was). Not only is it a great sequel, but it's a great movie (which few sequels strive to be)However, the 1 things that is absolutely killing me is this.... the original trainspotting was set in the late 80's. This movie takes place 20 years later yet it is present day 2017, it's 30 years later.",T2 Trainspotting
148,christonr-64261,Choose remakes. Choose re-imaginings. Choose sequels. Choose reboots. Choose life in 2017.,5,24 February 2017,"Following in the recent trend of dated sequels, reboots and kick-starts (literally and figuratively) here Danny Boyle's 90s cult classic gets a final shot in the arm; loosely hanging its narrative and character development around Irving Welsh's literary sequel 'Porno' and trying to circumnavigate a world two decades older – and wearier – than its predecessor (despite the book only giving way to nine).All of the familiar faces are back – and those who aren't are at least in some way alluded to or given a not-so-subtle nod – but now generally referred to by their given names: Mark (Renton), Simon (Sick-Boy), Danny (Spud) and Frank (Begbie). And generally speaking, T2 is very much a nostalgia piece, revisiting all of the iconic imagery, scenery and/or moments which made the first movie so overtly unique, refreshing and unforgettable: from the worst toilet in Scotland, to parallel chase sequence moments, to snarky comments about the danger of underage girls; this follow-up seems almost determined to create an abstract sense of reflection. We as an audience are offered the chance to relive and reminisce on past glories in much the same way as the characters on-screen are. The misanthropic tone is a far cry from the jubilant anger of the first incarnation however and McGregor's lengthy 'Choose Life' explanatory diatribe (citing more modern pitfalls of Facebook, Twitter and ""Slut Shaming"") is the only real moment in which any character fully engages and communicates a sense of circumstantial disillusionment. On a positive note, the character development of Spud – who emerges as the primary, sympathetic protagonist – is excellent; despite what feels like a somewhat-forced, Hollywood-friendly, conclusive arc for Ewen Bremner's dim-witted addict. Overall, it's a serviceable enough cap tip to the original, but truthfully lacks the bark or bite to have the modern day resonance it craves (and the original so easily garnered).",T2 Trainspotting
149,carolinajh,I hate this movie,1,19 April 2019,"The first movie was an amazing triumph of sadness, societal degradation, drug use, emotional dissidents, and attempted retribution only to be completely unfounded in the second movie. None of the characters from the first film largely better themselves, and only to prove they are the degenerates we saw through out the entire first film without a redeemable trait amongst them.I hoped to see at least a modicum of hopefulness in one of the characters, but none of them learned from their mistakes. I was very disappointed, and wished I had never bothered. The nostalgia of this film ruins what anyone would've loved about the first film.",T2 Trainspotting

Should have stuck to the plot the books take. Why the writer of this believes he/she is clearly better then Mr Welsh, the author is beyond me. There really was no need to create an entirely new storyline. Ok for the sake of a film, certain things may need to have artistic or creative license, but to almost completely create a new story without any homage to the original plot the books take is just an ego trip IMO. This film isn't funny, it doesn't have any real iconic soundtrack apart from the end track! and smacks of an exercise in money making at the expense of a film that should have been a million times better.

I can't see anyone who hasn't seen Trainspotting enjoying it. It's not bad either, but it lacks everything that made the first movie so good, the energy, the edge, the tightness. I liked it because I like the first movie, I like these characters and here they are, all back for more antics. Where this movie is clever, is that it actually is all about the characters coming to terms with their past. Nostalgia. Remorse. The impossibility of turning back the clock. Even the new character, Veronica, which, by the way, is very good and doesn't feel tacked on, is here to help the characters do this. The movie is also interspersed, not only with footage from the first one, but also with flashbacks from the characters' childhood.I don't think I will re-watch T2, at least not in the near future, but I spent two enjoyable hours and didn't feel cheated, even it wasn't as unforgettable as the original Trainspotting.",T2 Trainspotting

The cast and director Danny Boyle do their best to make a more than decent sequel of a cult movie.

156,Habus,A DVD Bonus Material,5,24 February 2017,"That's what this is. It really feels just like a DVD/Blu-Ray bonus material for the original Trainspotting. Now don't get me wrong, Danny Boyle and his crew did quite a good job, it was really interesting and sometimes funny to watch the fate of the four main characters from the cult classic. But that's the point - Trainspotting was basically about life and death around heroin addiction. T2 is just about those 4 guys from the first film. Like an extended version of a film. Of course they tried to fit in the ""choose life"" message for the current standards, but it failed to meet the merit of the original, it's just floating there without any clue to hold on. Also I can't imagine how this movie would be judged by somebody, who haven't seen the original Trainspotting. I guess it would score pretty low, because T2 builds on the contexts from its predecessor. So yeah, for the Trainspotting fans quite enjoyable, for the rest probably not. I give each star for Renton (who's running in the fog), Spud (who is trying to fix his life), Sick Boy (who's just a sick boy making out his living the sick way) and Begby (who shouts ""Cunt!"" most of the time) and of course one star for Danny Boyle for bringing back a huge portion of nostalgia.",T2 Trainspotting

Well I watched it with some of my buddies who saw the original in the theater and we all agreed. It was great. Its a a dark movie like the original but it works. I found it interesting that when Renton meets up with Diane, its not what i expected. No Hollywood type get together. But a blunt meeting (wont get into it) and than its over. The music also was great. Loved the way they not only added new songs, but sorta did little changes to the original soundtrack but slipped them in from time to time in the movie. I'll say this, Begbie has to be one of the best bad guys in the movies in the last 20 years. Lunatic would be saying it nicely. Overall, one of the best sequels I have seen.",T2 Trainspotting
160,andrewrmiddleton,Beautifully and inventively shot rush of adrenalin,10,10 January 2018,"Don't be under any doubt that T2 is very underrated as a standalone piece of work. It's a beautifully and inventively shot rush of adrenalin.Robert Carlyle gives another masterful performance as the psychotic, yet ultimately more self-aware, Begbie. Ewan Bremner is also excellent in re-creating the hapless and hilarious Spud. What the movie does extremely well is stay true to and connect with the original, but in a mature and non-convoluted way. Just like the original it opens at a frenetic pace, with Renton sprinting and a high energy track blasting in the background. But this time it's on a treadmill in Amsterdam, to the incessant pounding of the addictive Shotgun Mouthwash. We instantly know and feel that this is the contemporary part of the same universe.If you're familiar with Scotland, you'll also know the significance of the Eastern European greeters at the airport, Sick Boy's Bulgarian prostitute girlfriend, and Renton riding the tram through Haymarket into Edinburgh. Renton is experiencing the changes to the country, for better or worse, since he left 20 years ago.A various points throughout the movie, we flash back to connecting moments from the original, and even to connecting moments from the distant past that we've never seen before but somehow feel we have. Nostalgia is a significant part of the movie, but not in a way which feels forced or tacky. It's about connection to the past, and the characters self-assessing the courses of their lives.Obviously based on the novels Trainspotting and Porno, there isn't a standard movie plot structure. And why should there be? In my view, this would have detracted from what the movie is - a window into the current lives of the characters we know and love, and a sharing with them of their analysis of the courses their lives have taken over the past 20 years and of their insecurities about their legacies.There's a depth and artistry to this movie which would be missed by the ordinary movie-goer.

But this is a new low here. Even ""The Beach"" had more of a story and at least some good scenes. This has nothing except one of the worst soundtracks in film history, songs so bad and uninteresting, I couldn't believe my ears. The screenplay makes no sense: No motivation by any character makes sense, plot development is not logical, the whole movie has no real point or even a reason to exist. And it's far too long. The genius of the original film was the great editing and pacing, which is totally gone now at 2 looong hours. Instead of fast-paced fun we get endless nostalgia and flashbacks to the original film, which makes the badness of the new film even more visible, because the original had so much greatness to offer. I really can't understand people who like this. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Since it didn't play more than 2 weeks in my town, I'm not the only one, who didn't get what he hoped for...I only gave it 2/10 because of some inventive cinematography. Don't bother.

Gone are the days of creativity and originality that gave birth to classic movies like trainspotting in the past.Worst part: The plot is so paper thin it might as well have been written for a cartoon.

There is an underlying savage viciousness to the humour which doesn't let you down and it is as good a follow-up as you could possibly expect. The under-achieving of each character lends a bitter-sweet quality that retains all the edge of the original but contributes so much more.

But someone clarified that it was not made outside the novel to make money. It's indeed adapted from the sequel book of the original film's source. Though coming out 20 years later was the disadvantage. Except some praises it had received, particularly by its hardcore fans, it was average at the box office and I thought same as well.
I did not like the story. It was just a random drag, not knowing what direction to head. That's until the third act, and once all the three main characters come together, so it gets interesting with something. Like surviving from from a revenge threat. It was the actors who saved the film. Otherwise, it is not even an average as I consider now. I don't think retaining the title was a good idea, but I think it was just for its fans. Or else, a new title name would have done a decent justice to what it had narrated.
As I know, this is the director's first ever sequel and he's not getting better since his Oscar win, a decade ago. Especially the last two flicks, despite based on the very good subjects. Definitely no to the T3. Instead, I want another Oscar nod film from him. This would have been ever worse if somebody else would have made it. Yet, a watchable film, only if you had liked the first.

But in this case I have to mention that T2 meets expectations for those who loved the first one.The movie old characters are all great in this part, Chemistry is still there and the story has passed as in our real life. The movie also displays perfectly changes in society and scenes, Scotland appears more modern and improved and this is specially delivered in the opening scene when Ewan comes back.The movie displays also a lot of trubites to the music of first part and to characters generation, David Bowies disc, Iggy pop, Radio Gaga in the club ... etc. At the same time delivers new tasted followed by the young generation.In my opinion, the movie has only one weakness, the story itself, I think that while it succeeds in reflecting the developments in the characters life and Scotland, It still has a quite weak story !! What is the Climax in this movie ?!!So, in conclusion, great movie for all the nostalgic, with great performances and reflections of the characters society.

174,mike-3905,A Worthy Successor,8,7 January 2018,"Having just finished T2 I can pronounce it a worthy successor. I first read the book (which I thought fairly dark) as a young man in the 90s then saw the movie and thought it relatively lighthearted and funny. T2 is in the same vein and hits all its marks just as Mark says. The updated ""Choose Life"" monologue is excoriatingly on-point. The film is worthy in its story, its visuals, but particularly in its perspective. It allows the viewer to reflect on early choices made in the heat of the moment, and on the importance of ""character"". All the characters grow up a little bit, but not as much as you'd hope. Spud is still a loser but he is the childlike heart of the story to Renton's intelligent yet impulsive grownup. Diane is also worthy of mention, remaining an aloof and cool super-ego, the person Renton wishes he could be. In the Netflix age this could easily have been spun out to a dozen hours (which would have eclipsed the original movie) but does well to tell its story in the alloted time.Finally: read the books.",T2 Trainspotting

I must have seen it a dozen times at least. The original was reshown on UK TV a few weeks back and after not watching it for years I was surprised at how well it still stands up, simply a fantastic film in so many ways. So we were pretty excited about the sequel. You know that feeling when you sit down to watch a film and after 15 minutes or so you get a sinking feeling of ""uh"", and there's this instant transition from excited expectation to ""how long before this finishes before I can move on with my life?"" It wasn't BAD, there were definitely some inspired scenes, the 1690 bit was brilliant, Spud with the bag on his head, but there simply wasn't enough to hold it together. Some of the dialogue was poor, and the interaction between the female lead and the rest of them was leaden and clunky. I'm not sure if it was her acting skills or the script she was working with. Begbie could have saved this film, and his opening scenes were very promising, but at some point he just fell flat, again, a lot of this down to the scripting. He simply wasn't scary any more. Ewan Bremner as Spud, however, shines in this film and I hope this gives his career a resurgence. My overall feeling was one of disappointment, everything seemed flat, forced and a bit second rate. I have the feeling this might be one of those films that gets better on the second watch, but I think, in general T2 misses the mark by a long way.",T2 Trainspotting

Choose watching history repeat itself. Choose the slow reconciliation towards what you can get, rather than what you always hoped for.
-Renton (T2: Trainspotting)The Big Chill (1983) is the story of a group of college friends who reunite 15 years after graduation to mourn the death of a friend. It is, to me, the quintessential film of the Boomer Generation at middle age.
The Big Chill is about entering the time of consequences. At 40 your opportunities to reinvent yourself are starting to run low. Sure you might learn a new language or start a new business, but you probably aren't going to be a rock star or doctor.
At 40, the choices you made in your 20s are either paying off, or it is time to dig in and make life what you want it to be.

________________________________________
Choose life.
The best-known section of the original Trainspotting is Renton's ""Choose Life"" speech. It was a cynical take on the 90s branded, packaged, consumerist world.
The film's ending has Renton deciding to choose that version of Life after all. For a generation that could not see how to get off the ride, buying-into-buying seemed one of the only solutions.
T2, then, is the cost of this choice.T2 Trainspotting picks up 20 years after the first film with Renton returning to Edinburgh for the first time. The life he (literally) bought into at the end of the original film has gone off the rails.
Unsure of how to move forward, Renton is going back to the beginning. Simon (Sickboy) ridicules Renton for maudlin looking-back.
""It's just nostalgia! You're a tourist in your own youth. We were young; bad things happened.""
This mirrors my favorite line from The Big Chill. Tom Berenger's character Sam chastises his friends with the line ""So what's the thrust here? We were great then and we're s*** now? I don't buy that.""
Renton and his former mates are stand-ins for my generation. Now middle aged, Generation X is at that turning point. Squeezed between the over-achieving Boomers and the impatient Millennials.
It's time to buy-in or get out.
Again.Renton updates the Choose Life speech to express a feeling of being left out and passed over. In a world where everyone has a voice, is anyone listening?
The new version again attacks the consumer culture, this time represented by iPhones and cheap imported clothing. Twenty years on, society is still structured around committing commerce as the path to happiness.
________________________________________
At middle age, Generation X is asking many of the same questions we did in our 20s.
Do we choose from an updated menu of consumer goods and a social media that sells us as their product?
Or can we get off the ride? Opt out?
Choose life.",T2 Trainspotting
179,RaveReviewerzzz,20 year wait for this train crash of a sequel!,1,29 January 2017,"The original Trainspotting was One of the most stylish, iconic, shocking and funniest films of the 90s decade - now its back with the same cast and director and based on a novel by the author of Trainspotting. What could go wrong - well everything really. This film is a lazy sequel where the only good points are the nods it gives to the original. Anyone who hasn't seen the original will wonder what all the fuss is about as T2 is like a cheap TV movie. No humour, average acting (at best), forgettable soundtrack and weak story. The original was imaginative, almost artistic- well it was about heroin after all! T2 in comparison felt like a cobbled together load of weak comedy sketches. By the end I couldn't have cared which characters lived or died. This sequel I predict will be soon forgotten about and then we can all get back to talking about how great the Trainspotting was. Danny Boyle has made another dud film although I'm sure he'll earn lots from us nostalgics. Choose life - choose another film.",T2 Trainspotting
180,rocky_pch,Not the greatest but better than most sequels.,8,31 January 2017,"Not quite as nostalgic as some people think, this film keeps the fanwank down to a minimum and keeps us fairly engaged with the lads and lasses. I was particularly glad to see the chapter ""Trainspotting at Leith Station"" finally make it to the big screen and was one of the most jarring omissions from the original film. Without it, Begbie's character was quite one-dimensional and the title made no sense. With it, T2 makes more sense and elicits more sympathy from the viewer. The idea that Spud is committing all these adventures to paper and Gail's ""idea for a title"" was nice and places the book in the proper context. Good, not great. More worthy a sequel than many a X-Men film I could mention.",T2 Trainspotting
181,Ntara-1,Don't believe the critics...this is a masterpiece of a sequel,10,13 June 2017,"I was thoroughly impressed with this sequel. It was exciting, surprising, and took some turns that no one could have predicted. I don't know what all these negative reviewers were expecting. Did you just want to see a bunch of mid-40s junkies all getting together to do the exact same thing they did when they were in their 20s? That would have been boring as shite. There is character growth (and without spoiling anything) in some places I would have never guessed. The movie almost had me in tears at certain moments. This was not just a reboot for the sake of getting some money from a successful movie. This was an honest to the original piece of artwork that anyone with an open mind who liked Trainspotting would enjoy thoroughly. Outstanding soundtrack, wide variety of emotions expressed, and best of all (in my humble opinion) the cinematography was out of this world phenomenal. Choose Trainspotting 2.",T2 Trainspotting
182,smcdonald-23418,Choose Trainspotting 2!,10,29 January 2017,"This film as absolutely fantastic. I was drawn in & completely involved from the very first scene to the very last (as someone who gets easily distracted in a bust theatre, that's saying something!). It is the first time in years I have been to a cinema showing where there was a round of applause and cheering when the credits rolled!It has a heftier dose of comedy in than the first - some of the humour is very dark as typical of Irvine Welsh, other bits of humour are much lighter. Some bits of humour might bypass non-Scottish audiences (particularly scenes from a social club in Glasgow), but most will be enjoyed by all. Some humour is in direct reference to the first film, which generates a nice feeling of sharing 'in-jokes' with the characters, although this hand is never overplayed/relied upon.It has heartbreakingly tragic elements to it, and I feel it gives a much rounder impression of all of the main characters this time. You get to see more of/different sides to Renton, Spud, Sick Boy & Begbie - some sides more or less likable depending on your own take on each character. The film has a lovely way of weaving the lives of the characters together - pre-Trainspotting, post-Trainspotting; Trainspotting 2 and what may come after Trainspotting 2. For me, it makes a really tragic observation on how we were all once innocent children, and how our choices and those of others can conceal that fact; but deep down, that innocent child in all of us remains. We can change our circumstances and behaviours, but can we really change who we are?This film will make you laugh, cry, wince, reminisce, balk, feel frightened, feel hopeful & hopeless. If you loved the first film, you'll love this, I'm sure. If you haven't seen the first one or don't remember much about it, do yourself a favour and watch the first again to get maximum enjoyment out of it. I'm so glad they waited 20 years before doing it again - it would not have had the same impact had it been earlier.",T2 Trainspotting

185,mholtebeck,Not as good as the original,5,2 December 2017,"The original film had such a great pace, but the plot was really simple. It was based on Mark's hopelessness and trying to control his addiction. It was dark and wonderful. From the very beginning it draws you in with the toilet scene.This has none of that. The plot is complicated with 5 characters having their own stories that only merge by force. I watched the movie, and still don't know why Mark went back to Edinborough. And if he did, why did he look up his old mates. He doesn't seem to have any strong affinity for them. It's believable that Begbie would be in jail, but it's not believable that somebody would tip the police off to his whereabouts. The first one he was an annoying psychopath who was their friend. Now he is a dangerous man.The biggest problem is the pacing and convoluted plot. The first film had a basic plot, and the characters interacted with Mark. I watch it and lose track of time. This has multiple plot devices, but I looked at my watch halfway through and wanted it to move on I wasn't vested in the plot. The angles and film devices seemed forced, so it did't work.As a sequel to the original, it was fine, but it fails as an original story.",T2 Trainspotting
186,viper-57726,Superb sequel,10,1 March 2017,"Was great to see a film that was a bit smaller in scale and not focused on action set pieces in the cinemas, especially a sequel to one of the biggest cult hits to come out of Scotland; so I was already going in with high hopes and really wanted to like this.Fortunately it delivers, a few minutes in and any concerns this would be a let down just melted away. It's a perfect balance between progressing the story and nostalgic nod to the original, reminding us how crazy the gap between these have been. It's great they held off until the whole cast would return, even down to minor characters which is just excellent as no aspect of the plot suffers due to a loss of one of the cast. The plot actually benefits from the time, namely due to the antics of Begbie in the first film.This film has enjoyed a fair few glowing reviews so I doubt scouring the IMDM reviews is required to convince anyone to go see if they are already thinking about it, just go for it and you will get what you hope for; strong story, excellent acting and once again played out to an amazing soundtrack. Can't really fault this one at all with how well it balances the humour, tension and more serious aspects just like the original and in some ways surpasses it, thus why the 10 star rating.Enjoy!",T2 Trainspotting
187,lrtb-34348,Trainspotting ... after 20 years,10,29 July 2017,"I am a fan of the first Trainspotting, so, just to not put myself down, I tried to not expect much, after all, 20 years ahead of the first movie, and a second part ... I didn't know what to expect.First time I watched Trainspotting, I was around 18 years old, now I am 34 years old, and I can relate even deeper with the characters. A bunch of grown up losers, just trying to have a life. When I was watching this movie, I had the same feeling as when I read Bukowski, a feeling of my-life-is-f#$@%d-up-but-at-least-I-am-not-the-only- one. The feeling of nostalgia is there, but the movie is not based in nostalgia, it can even be seen as a stand alone movie, without watching the first one. Yes, there are some flashbacks, and some moments that get connected, if not repeated, to the first Trainspotting, but, this is what is expected of a second part, specially a cult movie that many of us grow up with. The acting, the OST, the plot, everything is perfect. And the characters are the same as the first movie, but grown ups ... ... This is Trainspotting, 20 years after, including the ""choose life"" talk. Just that, and as-perfect-as-that ... 10/10",T2 Trainspotting

There were many insides from the first movie and I loved that, but there were long moments and the story could have been better. But the photography of this movie was off the chart, I really loved it, it sells you nostalgia! The first movie ends on a good note: that you can come out of a bad lifestyle and things will get better BUT the second movie kills it when you realize that Renton f*ck up his life all over again and he doesn't even need drugs to do so.Overall, the movie is great if you are a fan without any expectations.",T2 Trainspotting

It wasn't the film I wanted it to be, and it definitely wasnt the film it should have been (Porno) - BUT.My God I was wrong.I don't know what changed, or what made me want to give it another go but I'm very glad I did.The film brings is upto date with the main characters of the first film is such a well thought and done way. None of them have made a particular good job of getting their lives on track, and that's OK. Because, how many of us have?It's a truly thoughtful look at what it means for a bunch of friends that once meant so much to each other and then lost track and meet up again. The bad vibes are all there, the good memories.The memories and nostalgia the film evokes within itself is amazing. Spuds role especially, that - That's just pure genius topped with a giant 'I've think I've thought of a title"" shaped cherry.I see many bad reviews of this film, and get it. I really do. I personally told as many people i could to avoid this film if they had any love for the first one.And now I feel like I've done them a disservice.Please, give this film a second chance and don't expect it tell you the story you want.Let it tells its own story because it definitely deserves the chance.",T2 Trainspotting
191,ben-812,"As good as it could be, but far from great",6,1 February 2017,"""Porno"" wasn't a great Irvine Welsh book, but at least it introduced new characters and updated us on the whereabouts of the original Trainspotting crew. The ""prequel"" Skag Boys was to my mind much much better.The problem is, Porno couldn't really be filmed, as it concentrates on the filming of pornography. So instead, some elements (but not many) of it have been lifted to make T2, but most of T2 is ""original"". It's around 5% Porno if that.However, I'd estimate that maybe 10 minutes in total of T2 is direct samples of the first film. Sure, have a bit of it in there, but we all know that T2 is a sequel of a film famous enough to have stuck in our memories. And I felt that constant referring back was after a while unnecessary, and intrusive.There wasn't a single scene in ""T2"" that could hold up to anything in the original. Not one.Look, I'm glad I saw it, but it's not something I'd really watch again more than once. Some films are classics because they are of their time: Trainspotting; Pulp Fiction; the Big Lebowski; Withnail and I. Trying to do a sequel for any of them is going to be a pointless exercise, you could never do one that holds a candle to the original.What Boyle and co have tried to do in ""T2"" could have been much worse; but it couldn't have been much better either. The past is the past, and we should leave it there.",T2 Trainspotting

I just joined the train at its second stop so to speak.And I was blown away! I saw the first Trainspotting (after the T2 Trailer came out, which i loved), I liked it...but nothing more. (I will probably get a lot of hate for saying this ) Critics and ""seasoned"" cinema goer alike are all saying that they were hoping for more. That the T2 can't live up to the original. I believe that to be a whole lot of emotional ballast keeping them from really seeing T2 in all its glory.Reason why loved it so much: The Characters. Nothing to add. Everybody knows that.The Cinematographie. It has been a long time since I saw a motion picture that kept me on the edge of my seat not only because of the story but because of the amazing an creative camera work. Every shot incredibly inventive, amazing and simply beautiful.The Soundtrack. Left the Cinema, bought the soundtrack. Nothing to add.Ewan McGregor.

But this is not the case with Trainspotting 2, Danny Boyle did a brilliant job! You are there 20 years later but you never let, but you kind of did leave.......It brings you up to date on where everyone is now and what led to it, the characters have matured but still retain character traits and personality.

195,akarmiotis-94922,T2 is the perfect footnote to a masterpiece,8,5 March 2017,"T2 Trainspotting is a powerful but complicated film. On one hand it continues the story of Renton and his crew with a natural progression of both character and tone, capturing the essence of true nostalgia as both we, and the characters, are trapped in the first films events. On the other hand, this very nostalgia threatens to minimise the audience for this new feature, making it difficult to enjoy if you don't have a passion for the original masterpiece. The film is more an extended epilogue than an actual feature.While the first Trainspotting was told purely through the eyes of Renton, this film chooses to focus on each of the group separately and slowly bring them together as they begin to mend their broken friendship. While giving the film a sometimes fractured feel, this tactic does work in fleshing out all the characters and giving them each a drive lacking in the original. This is particularly true of Spud who is given a redemption and focus that makes him arguably the protagonist over the often selfish Renton. The focus too has changed from heroin addiction to simply self-destructive behaviour; they continue to flee from the pull of normal society but with age their methods have changed and their youthful rebellion has turned to a matured apathy.Intertwined with the original film, T2 revisits specific scenes and compliments them with an awareness that accurately capture the sensation of memory. Each iconic moment is looked upon with a melancholy that will touch the hearts of those who grew up with the film. However, this very thing that makes the film wonderful is also its greatest flaw; caught so much in the past it never truly stands on its own and will only ever be a companion piece to the original. Without an already strong investment in the lives of Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie, the film is nothing.Director Danny Boyle continues to show a flair for visual and masterfully blends serious subject matter with surreal visuals of such beauty that your eye is never uninterested. So many scenes drip with a stunning neon glow that gives the mundane a mesmerising quality and sucks you into the filmic world instantly; even more so as these sparks of surrealism no longer come from the end of a needle but the characters own spiralling sanity.Strong in character and visuals, T2 Trainspotting is a brilliant follow up that brings the iconic cast full circle, taking a realistic approach to what life would be like for them 20 years later rather than being a simple re-tread of the original. While incredible, the focus on the past and memory also keeps it rooted firmly in nostalgia and stops it from becoming iconic in its own right.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",T2 Trainspotting
196,zenophobe,Blew my expectations away. Loved every minute of this movie.,10,27 May 2017,"To be honest I didn't go out and see this movie when it was first released because I expected it to be a letdown as most sequels are. The start was a bit shaky because I got a bit frustrated that I wasn't able to pick up on every bit of Bigby's dialect and language and then I remembered that much like the original, you have time if you love this film to dissect it later. You remember it's the cadence and the flow of his speech and a few key words that help you get the gist. After that the movie just carried me away. I loved all the story lines that ran in so many different directions before you figure out the truth of what is really happening with our beloved characters. The music was outstanding just like it was in the first film. One character who is deceased in the first film is missed... I feel bad for Kevin McKidd not to take part in this glorious reunion but they made a nice homage to him. There is another central character that I really wished had more of a role in this film but I can understand the way the story is crafted that there really wasn't any room for her to make more of a contribution than what they have her doing. Sorry for the rest of you who didn't like it, I felt so strongly about this film I made the rare instance of trying to write an actual review and not just put my ""points"" down just so some others might take the chance on it and not be discouraged by the negative or dismissive reviews.--- Oh yeah, I also popped a piece of my favorite Delta9 espresso crunch before I watched it, that always helps how much I enjoy my films as well but it never misleads. I know I will continue to watch and love this film in future years much as I do with the first one.",T2 Trainspotting
197,thegreathealer,The train may be 20 years late but thankfully no derailment,6,3 March 2017,"Robbed of its Britpop relevance, instant pop cultural immortality and the kind of soundtrack that shuffle playlists were made for, T2 was already heading for the kind of sequelitis backlash that many who witnessed the seismic impact of the original justifiably feared. But the truth is this 21 Years Later sequel suffers only from unfair comparison to what is arguably one of the finest British movies ever made. Wise to the fact that both cast and iconography are both more than two decades old, screenwriter John Hodge and director Danny Boyle instead channel that oh so resonant subtext of the male friendship movie: namely, the inexorable slide towards middle age and a past littered with disappointments and regrets. Cherry-picking rather than adapting Irvine Welsh's own 2002 sequel, T2 struggles to have the same visceral hit of its predecessor. Instead what unfolds is a tale of recriminations, returns and revenge, as Renton (McGregor) comes home after a failed marriage and failed business to an Edinburgh largely unchanged since he fled with the proceeds of a heroin deal that forms the cathartic heart of the sequel. Fellow trainspotters 'Sick Boy' Simon (Miller) and Spud (Ewen Bremner) have led equally directionless and spiritless existences; the former now stinging affluent sexual deviants with the assistance of newcomer Veronica (Nedyalkova) while the latter beneficiary of Renton's £4,000 payoff from the first film has instead continued a life of addiction, failure and abject fatherhood that leaves him contemplating suicide until the intervention of his long lost friend. Once the fisticuffs and long repressed violence at Renton's betrayal are worked out of Simon's system, the pair hatch a scheme to embezzle enough money to open a brothel with the assistance of a £100,000 small business grant. Meanwhile, psychotic loose wheel Begbie (Carlyle) hatches a personally injurious scheme to break out of prison (having killed a man who reminded him of turncoat Renton in the interim period) and seek fatherly bonding with a son whose maturation has occurred in his absence. When news gets to him that the friend who robbed him of thousands is back in town, events escalate to a tense conclusion wherein sledgehammers are buried and the ties of old friendships are stretched to breaking point. T2 is never less than engrossing, even when shamelessly replaying the golden moments of its forebear like a greatest hits compilation. Likewise some of the scathing and pitch black humour of the original is instead traded for easy laughs and even some awkward set pieces (Renton and Simon trying to escape a pub they're about to fleece by riffing a spontaneous musical number is particularly cringeworthy and should have been cut at script level). But the goodwill generated just by seeing these four characters breathed into life again mostly allows T2 to escape a more damning appraisal. And this is very much a boys' film, as the proliferation of female characters in the original is here reduced to the aforementioned (and admittedly excellent) Nedyalkova and cough-and-spit cameos from Kelly McDonald and Shirley Henderson. Boyle's visual flair from the original is here more self-plagiaristic than innovative, and like its middle-aged miasmic subtext the film is somewhat baggy and punchdrunk around the middle. Still, it's hardly the titanic mess that many predicted, and at best it reminds one of the heady days of the mid- nineties, when Cool Britannia and New Labour once promised before never delivering.",T2 Trainspotting
198,pjonline66,Don't choose T2,5,8 February 2017,"Before you read any further I wish to disclose the fact that I am not the biggest fan of Danny Boyle. Although he has released some exceptional work throughout his career I consider him to be an overrated Director who has a disproportionate amount of awards and nominations under his name in comparison to the general quality of his films. As a British critic this seems to be a very unpopular opinion amongst the establishment and I wish to convey the fact that I do perhaps approach his films with a higher level of critique than others as a result. I guess you could call it an 'anti- establishment' stance against his popularity.I am not for one moment suggesting Boyle is a bad Director I just personally do not see the merits of the highly critically acclaimed Slumdog Millionaire or 127 Hours for example. My primary issue with his work is that he handles extremely difficult subject matter with a ironic or sarcastic tone. This tone seems to permeate its way through his work and it simply doesn't sit well with me. I would suggest the work of Shane Meadows for example is far superior when tackling social issues in the UK but unfortunately Meadows does not have the brand name that Boyle boasts in the world of cinema today.Having included the disclaimer above I do however consider the original Trainspotting to be Boyle's greatest work and it is rightly afforded cult status amongst its fans (of which I am one of). I never thought for one moment this text would be fertile feeding ground in this age of sequels and remakes but I was proved wrong as 2017 has brought us T2 Trainspotting. The original cast and Director have all come back together with a new story to tell and although I was approaching this title with a level of scepticism I was hoping that the team behind the original would have enough talents to produce a strong follow up.T2 follows Ewan McGregor's character Renton as he returns to Edinburgh for the first time in 20 years after leaving his friends with nothing. Understandably his old friends Simon, Spud & Begby greet Renton's return with a mix of emotions and the story is focused on his re-integration into a world that he had left.The original Trainspotting exhibits a wonderful mix of pathos, heartbreak and comedy and still holds up today as a unique piece of cinema. The original works for me as there is a sense of hope amongst its protagonists. They are addicts living a turbulent lifestyle in Edinburgh but they have their whole lives ahead of them and redemption is a distant yet constant figure on the horizon. T2 however seems to strip away all of the hope and optimism and focus solely on the misery and plight of its main characters 20 years on. This is extremely difficult to watch as we have developed an affinity with these characters from the original title and yet this film seems to suggest that you are always doomed from the outset no matter what changes you make in your life. In fact you begin to lose the sympathy you had for these characters in the original as they are still making the same mistakes in their middle age! I couldn't help thinking that the plight of the lead characters is wholeheartedly deserved in this sequel. They are not the lost victims of the Edinburgh drug scene anymore. They are simply criminals.This unfortunate development of the lead characters coupled with Boyle's sarcastic tone lends itself to a bizarre mix of extremely disturbing scenes with comedy. This time however we do not find their plight funny at all as it seems they are all destined to continue living bleak miserable lives. Is this a statement about the state of Scotland in today's society? Based on this portrayal the Scottish certainly wouldn't be better off if they left the UK....Admittedly this is a stronger outing than your average sequel or remake. It is clear that everyone involved in this title wanted to make a genuinely strong follow up to the original instead of 'cashing in' but unfortunately it simply doesn't work. I was left depressed and disappointed when leaving the cinema. I am sure there is a good film somewhere here but Boyle completely misses the mark.",T2 Trainspotting

201,JeffTheBadger,Choose life. Choose T2 Trainspotting,8,30 January 2017,"Choose Life. Choose cinema hype for nostalgic films. Choose sequels that you don't expect to be as good as the first but hoping for at least something new. Choose walking into the screen with a mixture of excitement and dread. Choose sitting in your overpriced seat with your giant bank busting popcorn and your toilet trip inducing gallon of drink. Choose all this and you won't be disappointed T2 Trainspotting is a continuation of the first film with a 20 year gap in-between. All the boys are here: Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), they're back in Edinburgh and ready for the next chapter of their lives. If you have not seen Trainspotting before, watch it. Not just because it is a good film but you need to remember the first one to properly understand this one. Then you need to immediately put it out your mind because this is definitely a sequel, not a re-hash of what was. The characters are older and because of this they are different to how they were, their lives are different, their relationships are different, their motivations, their attachments, everything has changed, you have probably changed too and yet many of the situations and scenes have a very familiar feel to them. Links to the past, little nods here and there to both the first film and real life are strewn throughout but never feel forced.As you would expect from a Danny Boyle film, the style is great and each scene has a purpose whether it is to remind the viewer of who these people where, or show them where they are heading. It is true the story is not as hard hitting, but then how could it be? And yes, Begbie is a bit of a caricature now and not quite the man he was in the first instalment but you know what? That's OK. Any failings or let downs are immediately made up for by something else. Something good. The story touches on so much it just keeps you engaged. Friendship, love, betrayal, regret, hope, despair, danger – it's all in there, in spades! This is a good film and possibly more importantly, a great sequel.

202,jacintafortunata,Disappointing - a sequel to a cult classic is not possible perhaps,5,13 February 2017,"Gosh I didn't like it much... adored the first one - but one of the few things I did like about T2 was the nostalgic factor - for myself.. not only did I love the movie and the energy it had, and how of its time it was etc.. its a classic.. so it took me back to times when i watched the first one - and what was going on in my life then.. the nights out we had - tunes from the soundtrack were in the charts at the time - great memories.. Otherwise I found T2 so melancholy and flat; it didn't have the energy or humour of the 1st one.. the story line was crap.. the actors lacked enthusiasm - even when they did get the loan.. there was no energy about them.. Also I think that some of the references back to T1 were sad attempts to instill some life into the movie - but most of them just made me cringe.. Fecking hate Begbie's - regardless of his role.. loved spud(that was the one part about the story line I did like) - he was about the best actor in the film.. and the ladies hardly got a look in.. apart from veronica. And while it was nice to see the old head's - it would have been better to bring in some fresh actors.. the only one was Veronica of any significance.. added to the staleness. I still don't regret going to see it - I had too.. but I guess classic's can't be followed up.. leave them alone and the legacy they left behind.. like Whitnail and I etc.. It could have been a good movie in it's own entity - with a better story line - it was a well made movie in foundation. But if Danny Boyle wanted to make another movie he should just have gone ahead and done that - and left Trainspotting alone!Just MY opinion. 5.6/10",T2 Trainspotting

However, T2 Trainspotting is very good. It isn't a great film, but it is a very entertaining and satisfying sequel. The film is directed immaculately with gorgeous shot compositions and fantastic acting. However, in all honesty, the film feels a little pointless. Why did we need a sequel to Trainspotting?

Thank you.I was nervous, you were nervous the cast were nervous...is it worth the risk of ruining an iconic film with a sequel?We need not have feared T2 has it's own story to tell. It has ruined T1 for me a little as I'm now thinking T1 was but the mere prequel to the main event of T2:Trainspotting.At no point did I think we were watching anyone other than the same characters of 20 years ago, not Obi Wan, Sherlock, Hamish Macbeth or Julien-donkey boy...in truth I forgot they were actors...I was watching Renton, Sickboy, Begbie and Spud.Spud. How could you do this to us Danny? You made us fall in love with him all over again...""Spud never hurt anyone""...well many a girl will have shed tears for Spud like me over his story...and this is his story.You said ""it's based loosely on Porno"" but in truth it probably is non more far removed from the original novel as the first film was. Like the first film the screenplay takes out the bits in the novel nobody would ever want to see on screen and compacts events and characters brilliantly.I'm glad the film did not end like the book...the Mark and Simon relationship needed to be mended, deserved to be mended and right it was.You were right to wait twenty years for the sequel...it worked...but the third film does not need to wait that long please!T1 = Like a shot that makes you get up dancing.

It is what you hope it will be; tough, gritty, witty, funny, sad and yet hopeful. Great character development throughout, Carlyle and Bremner in particular are fantastic. Great soundtrack, keeps up the tempo of the film and places it in time. Yes, each film stands alone but together they seamlessly capture the passing and loss of time. This is where the film really hits home with 40 & 50 somethings. To get the full benefit of T2, revisit the original first. It was so good I sat through the credits, a sure sign that a film has hit the mark, quite and emotional roller coaster for a 50 something.",T2 Trainspotting

211,ghykal-343-903350,Seriously?,5,30 March 2017,"What's up with all the rave reviews?Look, it's not the worst movie ever made, but it's one of the most pointless. The first was a force of nature that gripped you from the beginning and took you on an adventure in a world foreign to most of us. And it was hilarious, filled with unforgettable scenes and belly laughs. This sequel is a nostalgic, where are they know, look back at the main characters from the original.It starts out choppy, never picks up a real driving force, and kind of meanders around until it finds a way to end. Begbie is supposed to be the villain that makes this thing move, but the rest of the crew aren't stupid kids anymore, and the fear he instills in the other characters just doesn't seem genuine. The Veronika character seems so forced. There's no groundwork laid to set up her relationship with Sick Boy or Renton. Her character is just too wise and put together to be a hooker hanging out with this sad lot of old junkies.Trainspotting had a compelling dynamic based on doomed friendships of young junkies, and the attempt to escape the impending doom by the protagonist. There was a force driving the movie from start to end. And there were non-stop laughs along the way mixed in with junkie philosophy and trippy drug-fueled scenes. That's all missing in this sad sequel, which walks in the footsteps of its predecessor, half-heartedly mimicking it. I wish I had just watched the first one again instead.",T2 Trainspotting
212,GroovyDave1973,Brilliant follow up,10,28 January 2017,"20 years on we find Renton in Amsterdam with a job, wife and running addiction, but with looming divorce, redundancy and the death of his mother he heads home to Edinburgh.Begbie in jail plots an escape, Sickboy is involved running a pub and a little extortion and Spud is still caught in the cycle of recovery and relapse.The pace of this film does not match the first, it is a much more nuanced, pedestrian pace but does have it bursts of exhilaration.Nostalgia plays a big part with flashbacks and nods to the original, but it is a lot more than a nostalgia fest, our players have evolved and matured at least in part and there can be little denial we are watching the same characters that captured our hearts over two decades ago.The Renton/Sickboy relationship is central to this sequel, but it is Spud's story that will capture your heart. When money threatens to once again present an opportunity for betrayal between Mark and Simon Spud steps up to take away the temptation.Spud takes to writing down personal stories and looks to collate them into a book and everyone who read them has an emotional response even Begbie.There will be plenty of detractors to this sequel, no doubt already armed with the hackneyed ""Not as good as the first"" but this is a story in it's own right and if Danny Boyle's intention was to make people happy he has surely been successful in that regard.A great sequel to a brilliant original that demands a third instalment...I just don't hope we have to wait 20 years for Trainspotting 3!",T2 Trainspotting

This film has excellent cinematography with inventive and creative shots, and precise editing that evokes whatever reaction it is going for to the maximum. Danny Boyle has exploited the medium of film perfectly with the visuals and audio combining to create a piece which really emotionally impacts you. It was funny, it was dark and it was a journey.

215,jordansanders-92728,T2 Trainspotting (2017) - The Boys Are Back In Town,6,13 October 2018,"Remember 'Trainspotting'?
Of course you do. Exploding onto our screens way back in 1996, Danny Boyle's iconic film blew audiences away and in the process managed to gain a loyal cult following and firmly cement it's place in the hearts of film fans everywhere.Yes, this seemingly simple little tale (adapted from Irvine Welsh's 1993 novel of the same name) of drug culture and urban life among a group of young friends in Scotland struck a chord with a disgruntled nation, still reeling from the 80's and still seething with hatred and anger towards Thatcher's Britain.
Glam rock, skinheads and discotheques had been replaced by seedy nightclubs, dance and house music and, of course, the use of hardcore drugs to nullify the pain of modern day life.Step forward Danny Boyle, armed with an absurdly talented young cast, a killer screenplay and a fantastic soundtrack to match, crafting not just one of the finest British films of the 1990's, but one of the finest British films period. It really is nothing short of a masterpiece.As always, though, the film did have it's fair share of critics and detractors, there were those who found it distasteful and accused it of glamorising drug use (though quite how they came to that particular conclusion I'll never know, that's akin to accusing Billy Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend' (1945) of glamorising alcohol addiction), but despite their best efforts, nobody was able to prevent it from becoming a smash-hit and rightfully securing it's place in the annals of British cinema.In essence, 'Trainspotting' became more than just a film, it became a statement, almost a cultural movement of sorts, a symbol that the youth of this great nation were taking matters into their own hands and, for better or for worse, controlling their own destiny.
Not only did the film manage to relate to audiences, it also managed to sum up the collective mood of society in the UK at that time and the characters (fatally flawed but never judged) resonated with movie-goers everywhere, both young and old.So of course, one was never going to be enough, as soon as the credits rolled at the end of the first film, we wanted more. Needed more. We needed to know what happened to these characters and how their lives transpired...
Did Renton finally manage to kick the habit and start a new life for himself with the money he stole?
Did Spud use the money left for him wisely and start anew or did he just flush it all down his veins?
What about Sick Boy? Did he hit the big time with another of his grand schemes to strike it rich or was he still stuck in the same rut as always, dreaming of a better future and contemplating where it all went wrong?
And then, of course, there's Begbie. No doubt incarcerated after the events of the first film, did he use prison as a platform to re-evaluate his life and turn over a new leaf or has he spent the last 20 years, stewing with anger and resentment, just plotting his revenge?These were questions that have plagued us for years and as time wore on and the cast and crew aged, the rumour mill continued to churn, but it began to look less and less likely that we would ever see a sequel and thus get the answers we've demanded for so long.Well, after 20 years, we finally got our wish.'T2' opens in very much the same fashion as the first film, the urgent beat of music snapping us out of our slumber, gripping us by the collars of our shirts and commanding our attention from the off. Cut to the inside of a pristine, modern day gymnasium and the first character we are to be reunited with is of course Renton, who just like in the first film is still running. However, he has traded running from security guards and police to running on a treadmill.
It's a glorious metaphor, perhaps suggesting that no matter how much you run, you won't get anywhere, you can never escape the past and inevitably it will always catch up with you, one way or another. And this is exactly what happens to Mark here, plagued by thoughts of the past he comes crashing to a halt, falling face-first onto the treadmill and is sent flying across the room. Lying there on the floor of the gym, the stark realisation sets in, the time has come for him to return to Edinburgh and face up to some past demons.What follows is a rushed and uneven (though necessary) opening sequence as we are reintroduced to the films four principle characters and we discover their fate and where they are today.
Mark 'Renton' (Ewan McGregor) has been living in Amsterdam since his previous betrayal, Simon 'Sick Boy' (Jonny Lee Miller) is an extortionist, making money by blackmailing wealthy businessmen as well as running a pub, Spud (Ewen Bremner) is still a heroin addict, his addiction causing him to now be separated from his wife and estranged son and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is still locked up, though after a cunning (and cringe-inducing) plan to escape makes his way back to his wife and son (who knew?), still intent on vengeance against Mark, who had wronged him so many years before.From here on out, the story unfolds and without giving too much away, Sick-Boy manages to convince Mark to join him in one of his clever money-making schemes, Spud, now suicidal, struggles with life and Begbie finally catches up with the man who ruined his life. So ultimately, the big question is, is this the sequel we've all been waiting for or is it little more than a disappointing exercise in digging up the past? Well unfortunately, it's closer to the latter. It's not a bad film by any means and it's apparent from these early sequences that a lot of love and effort has gone into recapturing the magic from the first film, but unfortunately it's also apparent that is a task easier said than done.A large part of Trainspotting's brilliance stemmed from the youth and energy driving it. Back then, Danny Boyle was an emerging young talent, eager to impress and make his mark. Nowadays he has become a household name, he has been to the very top rung of the filmmaking ladder, hitting the big-time with films such as '127 Hours' (2010), 'Steve Jobs' (2015) and most importantly 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008), and this shows, but not in a positive way. He gives his all in trying to recapture the zest and zeal he brought to his beloved original, but experience gained ironically hinders him from hitting those same high notes he did back in '96.
Not that it's badly directed, Boyle has proven time and again just what a talented director he is, but the over-stylised and polished feel he brings to this sequel just seems out of place.
It's as Sick-Boy himself quips in the film: ""I'm tying hard Mark! I'm not feeling anything!""'Trainspotting 2' can never be accused of not trying, it really does try. In fact, it often tries too hard for it's own good, but despite all the effort, we're just not quite feeling what we should be.
The relationship between Simon and Mark is still as engrossing as ever and it is their exchanges which really drive the film forward and there really are some wonderful scenes to be found amongst the clutter. The best of which comes midway through the film in which Simon and Mark find themselves stuck in a protestant pub and have to improvise a song about 'The Battle Of The Boyne' in order to circumvent an assured beating. It's one of the few sequences which truly encapsulates the heart and spirit of the original and plasters a huge grin across the faces of every Trainspotting fan in the audience.
Other highlights include a passionate rant about George Best, an ingenious split-screen shot in which Mark and Begbie are unknowingly sat beside one another in separate toilet cubicles and Mark's updated 'Choose Life' speech is well-written and brilliantly observed, if not a wee bit forced.However, there is very little in the way of substance or plot and as the film wears on it, this becomes more and more the case and it gradually loses it's way, descending into a Guy Ritchie-esque crime/comedy caper-come-revenge flick, which, in theory, there is little wrong with, but it's just not what we'd have expected, or indeed wanted, from a Trainspotting sequel. The gritty realism and brutality of the original is sacrificed here for over-the-top fight sequences and comic relief. We are offered up plates of nostalgia at the expense of depth, but in truth what we really wanted, was a little bit of both. There are plenty of subtle nods and references sprinkled throughout to help satisfy the die-hard fans among us, but once the end credits roll, more viewers than not will be walking away feeling just a little underwhelmed.But, despite all that has come before, it's the closing song that really sums up everything that went wrong with Trainspotting 2: The Prodigy's remix of Iggy Pop's classic 'Lust For Life'. It is a commendable and worthy effort, doing it's utmost to rejuvenate and revamp the past, but despite it's best efforts, it just can't hold a candle to the original's brilliance.So watch T2, revisit a few old friends, but just don't expect them to be precisely as you remember them. They, just like you, have had 20 years to shape and change themselves and they may not be exactly what you were expecting, but then again, isn't that the point? Times have changed and unfortunately, this sequel, much like the protagonists lives, is not quite how we imagined or hoped it would be...

216,StonedCrow,Decent trip down memory lane,7,30 December 2018,"I have been avoiding this film since release, as feedback from friends wasn't positive and I didn't want to sour what memories I had of the original. Yet, thanks to Netflix, I have finally gotten around to watching it.No, this film isn't amazing but neither is it overly bad. It is very much a film for fans of the original, especially those who were of/around age in the 90's when that film launched to phenomenal hype. It will not disappoint that demographic but the edginess of the original is gone, as you might expect 20 years after the fact. Maybe I was more naive back then, but the first film felt almost dangerous; in a good way, of course, but that is certainly missing here.Still, the acting is solid, the characters, feel and setting are familiar; and the film is paced about right. I would advise anybody not acquainted with the first film to skip this one though, or at the very least watch the nineties offering first. I can imagine T2 would be a very bland and slightly turgid experience for someone not already familiar with these characters and their story. I just can't imagine how one could fully enjoy this film without having seen that.For me, as I suspect it was for the cast and crew, it was an enjoyable trip of pure nostalgia, as I was 15 when the original was released and had to wait until the VHS back then to see it.T2 wasn't as boring nor as needless as I was led to believe.Give it a go......",T2 Trainspotting

But in T2 he struggles. Maybe all those years as an Americanized Sherlock Holmes has dulled his skills? This movie seemed more like an excuse to give Jonny Lee a starring comeback because of his TV notoriety. Robert Carlyle is always good...but too much is too much. His character(Frank) is so unlikable, that it overpowers the story. Once again, because of his success(?) on American TV, this seemed like another effort just to cash in on star-power. Unfortunately even Rumplestiltskin couldn't turn this one into gold. Ewan McGregor...the central character(?) is relegated to a supporting role, which I didn't mind, especially when he was supporting Spud. Danny (Spud) is the saving grace of this film...delivering an awesome and moving character from start to finish. Unfortunately, drug use isn't pretty, and it doesn't deliver enough strength to carry the movie. The entire story is simple, but weak...not enough twists and turns, relying too heavily on Frank's revenge again. The music is a big part of this...the soundtrack to the original Trainspotting is an all-time classic album...but this film lacks the power and excitement of the first. Even the flashback scenes don't invoke the proper nostalgia, leaving you really trying hard to remember why you liked the original. I'd say T2 is a must see for any Trainspotting fan. It answers the ""where are they now?"" question and partially completes the story. But only partially, since it doesn't satisfy. Don't watch this movie expecting to be satisfied.

For people like me who were 17 when Trainspotting came out, and who watched the movie up to 10-20 times in the following years and probably 30 times over the last 20 years, T2 is simply about reflection of the past 20 years. I cannot remember that someone did such a movie experiment before. Already the cast shows it, McGregor the superstar, well and the others, some also somehow successful in the film business, other less . T2 shows the quite disappointing development of the main characters and makes you, the audience, thinking about yourself, your goals 20 years ago, your achievements.

I was so excited to see all the old characters again that I was about 30-40 minutes in before I realised how poor it is.All the creators had to do was make a movie of Porno, which was the sequel to Welsh's book Trainspotting. T2's story is loosely based on parts of Porno but without the new characters.As noted in its Wikipedia entry, the film is 'self-referential' to the original, in that the creators have taken certain scenes from Trainspotting and tried to echo them.

The characters have been re-introduced 'most triumphant'ly, and just when they started to actually interact, 'the end' arrived. The whole plot from ""Porno"" was missing which would've been fine by me if it had been replaced with another plot, which it HADN'T. The movie... has no plot. Yeah, right!Then it took me another while to understand why Mr Boyle would do that to us. That's when I finally added 2 and 2. And here comes a piece of conspirology. My debut in that genre, in fact.We know that fans have been bugging Boyle for years with the sequel requests. We know that it had a lot to do with nostalgia. We know that nostalgia is quite unproductive unless we build on the past. And that's exactly what Boyle has shown to me. The stupidity of going exactly BACK. The movie was MEANT,CONCEIVED,PLANNED to be empty. To show the fans that when you require a rehash/replay/onemoregoatit, THAT'S what you usually get.

223,CPTrey,An absolute jumbled mess,2,3 April 2018,"I was floored by Trainspotting when I first saw it in the late 90's. It was fresh, original, edgy, brilliantly written, sharply directed and very well acted. Certainly a lot to live up to. So when I heard there would be a sequel, I was surprised to say the least. It didn't seem to warrant a sequel, particularly given how much the cast and crew has achieved since the original 1996 release. But in the hands of Danny Boyle, and with most of the original cast returning, I felt I should at least give it a chance. And once again, I was floored. This time by the jumbled mess that is T2. The story begins with promise: Mark Renton returns home to a widowed father, and seemingly tries to make amends for past wrongs. That's where the whole movie completely falls apart. Unfortunately, this is only the introductory scenes.From there, the story goes in several inexplicable directions at once. Sick Boy is elaborately blackmailing people with the help of Veronika, a character who literally makes no sense. She is maligned and used by Sick Boy, but also industrious with a strong business sense. Meanwhile, an imprisioned Begbie plots an elaborate prison escape, only to live with his wife and son for a while (?) and at no point does anybody track him down at the first logical place they can look. His career driven son then goes on a home invasion with Begbie for some ""father/son time."" Spud has nothing to live for and is disgusted to see Renton when he miraculously breaks down the door and saves Spud on his last breath. Mark ruined his life, but is also happy Mark is back in his life. He considers a career in boxing. I could go on, but it only gets more confusing from there. Alright I will - Sick Boy decides the perfect revenge is to ruin Mark's life, and at one point conspires with Begbie for help or something. At which point Begbie becomes a T-1000 and makes killing Mark his sole purpose. And remember Veronika? She steals the money they are wired - oh yeah - Mark and Sick Boy get a small business loan to open a brothel - so she steals the money, but not before helping Spud write a novel. And as a last act of kindness to Spud, whom she just met and has no allegiance to whatsoever, gives him a bunch of money at the end......because....nostalgia for the first movie? Speaking of nostalgia - Diane is back as a lawyer for one scene. It honestly felt like someone with a vague recollection of the original wrote the film as they went along. Given the stark contrast in reviews, I am also not 100% sure the positive and negative reviewers saw the same movie. The one I saw was a jumbled mess (can't stress that enough).

226,mamis62,"Conventional, unfortunately",6,27 March 2017,"I loved the first movie. I knew the sequel couldn't live up to its energy and originality, but I was still disappointed by this film. It just felt conventional, as if the filmmakers wanted to tell stories of what the characters SHOULD do, rather than what they WOULD do.Oprah Winfrey tells people to be their best selves; what I liked about the original is the filmmakers had the courage to show people being their worst selves and living with the consequences. This film felt too clean, too Hollywood. It felt like a movie made by people with money and attorneys and brands.If you loved the first you'll want to see this one, and you may not be as disappointed as I. But I have a feeling you'll find it hard to remember anything that happened in this movie a year from now.",T2 Trainspotting
227,dominic-brock,"Choose Trainspotting (And my God, what a choice!)",8,27 January 2017,"It's not often I go to the cinema to watch a day-one screening, but my love of Irvine Welsh and the previous Trainspotting film meant I just could not resist.This film is a wonderful show of friendship and Begbie's psycho temper which encapsulates left over stories from the first book and large portions of 'Porno' the following book.I'm pleased to announce that all characters still have that beautiful chemistry featured in the original and work to provide scenes of pure comedy genius and others of emotion and absolute anger. The film really lives and breathes nostalgia of its predecessor, as well as showing how, even if we all change on the outside, we are still the same on the insides. We all make the same choices in life over and over.My only complaint with this film is that it didn't feel as slick as the first film. This is probably because of the vast improvements in cinematography which you'd expect considering there's an over 20 year age gap. Transitional shots mean you're waiting that little bit longer, but you are probably looking at some of the best views Scotland has to offer in that time.To sum up, I'd have to say this film is essential viewing for anybody who's seen the first film or read the books. There are so many references which you'll pick up on, leaving you with a wry and joyous smile throughout. For anyone else, you need to watch the original film first (and understand Scottish for anyone reading not in the UK), but I assure you that this film will not disappoint. It's textbook Danny Boyle packed full of nostalgia",T2 Trainspotting

To fully enjoy the film and get the most out of it you have to be a fan of the original. It's not a film that needed to be made but it's still a decent flick.

229,RobertoHigor,A nostalgia trip with old friends.,7,24 May 2017,"T2 is a movie that only exists to provide a nostalgia trip and a revisit to the trainspotting characters and catching up with their lives.This movie is a revisit to old scenarios, musics and characters that you like. It's more of a friendly reunion than a meaningful thing. Some of the scenes feels like it was only made so that the actors can have fun doing it, instead of telling a story.If you want to revisit the first movie without watching it again, You'll probably have fun but without any memorable scene. I found the editing and the visuals great in some scenes, having the parallels to first movie but unfortunately only reinforcing that the movie doesn't stand on it's on and depends on the first one for lack of original content.. I enjoyed the movie but the story not so much.",T2 Trainspotting
230,stefhavermans,Don't choose this movie.,5,30 May 2017,"This movie caught my eye very fast, as I'm a fan of the first Trainspotting, and I couldn't wait to give the sequel a chance.There are a few things I like about the sequel to a classic and I will start with these. The feeling this movie gave me was quite nostalgic. The movie feels a lot like the first and some of the actors ooze talent in small proportions. That's it. 2 positives. Now let's get to the parts where the movie bored the crap out of me.The feminine actress, who played Veronica... She's horrible. Her acting is horrible, and her role in the movie illustrates how weak the plot is. The amount of screen time she gets, without her actually fitting the bigger picture or having any sort of chemistry with the main characters is ridiculous. After watching about a small hour of the movie, you begin to wonder when the plot is actually going to thicken. But as I already mentioned above the plot is weak and development is very slowly. Well, it's actually paper-thin. The movie constantly needs to make flashbacks to the previous one to create screen time. Conversations are weak, things are a lot less abstract and the chemistry that made the first movie great lacked.The quotes feel forced. Choose life, Choose SnapChat. Choose Facebook. How is this not cringe worthy? The Snapchat scene in the car was also very cringe-worthy. The movie tries to hard to be authentic and get the nostalgic feeling, it just forgets to get the plot out.Also, where the f*ck is the police? Franco has been escaped out of jail, sleeping in his own bed, visiting his own house and threatening his wife and son. The police are sleeping in a car around the corner ? The parking garage also clearly has cameras, so it would be very hard to believe no one called the police after the accidents which happened...To conclude. The movie is bad. Is it horrible ? Nope. Is it likable? For some people the nostalgia will compensate for the lack of story. Will i watch it again or advise it to someone ? Definitely not... Being a big fan of the original Trainspotting, this movie disappointed me beyond all expectations and I've would rather have no sequel if I knew it was going to be like this.",T2 Trainspotting

We are given a blow by blow introduction the original cast. I was waiting throughout the movie to actually give a damn for anybody. It left me cold, and I was one waiting with anticipation for T2. I don't know if it was the director, the writing or the acting. Someones to blame. Even throughout the movie, the original soundtrack is hinted but nothing solid.

I knew it wouldn't (couldn't!) live up to the original film but it left me feeling a little disappointed... but not - perhaps - for the obvious reasons.The cast, acting and cinematography were first class. No issues there. It was the story line and to a lesser extent the script. The original Trainspotting contains a beautiful mix of tragedy, fantastic music, black humour and the occasional bit of senseless violence...When they wrote T2 they decided to just come up with ways to try to pay homage to T1 and forgot the plot to the book Porno (the sequel to Trainspotting) pretty much entirely. They also lost most of the (admittedly very dark) humour and a lot of the plot devices became fairly predictable.It was never going to have an easy time of things - T1 was such a seminal film that following in it's footsteps was always going to be difficult. So I don't want to be too critical of T2 - it was still a good film. It's just that they missed a lot of potential there to make it a lot better than they did. And the material was given to them in the book Porno - they just decided not to use it for some reason...",T2 Trainspotting

This film is about forgiving, forgetting, friendship, helping others and getting old. This film shows that friendships last forever, and that the quicker you forgive and forget - the greater friendships. It shows how live changes as us beginning to get older.

243,ghamilton-04250,Grieving and Mourning in Port Sunshine,6,31 January 2017,"Never done a film review before, but felt compelled to put something down.. As 44 year old that grew up in Glasgow and left in early my early 20s I always had an infinity with Welsh's novels. Through the nightmares of marabou stork, the spiraling world of Detective Bruce Robertson and the exploits of 'Juice' Terry. But it was with Trainspotting that it all started. And even with the early stage shows I was hooked on the dark world of welsh's grim characters. By the time I heard that the film was underway I had already moved to London and was eagerly anticipating 'the arrival' from the posters. I came out of that first showing a bit bewildered. That's not an image of 'General Franco'. Mikes Foresters a wimp (sorry Irvine!) Renton from the stage is now the 'catboy' and where is second prize and the others? But as a film, the characters, the pace the and the lines.....'He's always been lacking in moral fiber..."" But' he knows a lot aboot Sean Connery' 'That's hardly a substitute!!' And the music score, from IPs intro lust for life through to pulps mile-end. It just worked, it so worked. It was not the book, couldn't be. It was something and it was genius. fast forward 10 years later I'm waiting for 3 hours in the rain outside a bookshop to get a signed copy of 'Porno'. And I loved it. So you can imagine the Anticipation I had when Boyle announced the return of Granton Star express and the first of the trailers started to appear. for 2016 I forget Bourne, Rogue in the sequel world one nothing else mattered and Stupidly I had built things up in my head to a level that that was never going to to be matched. I was actually starting to dread it following the 'premier' comments that it does not disappoint. But as I sat there and watched things unfold from early on it felt labored and disconnected. I just so want this to work. I'm trying trying to force myself to love it, we trundle into the 1690 episode and what's Scotsman doesn't love a good sectarian joke & with sick-boy on the ivories. But it starts going downhill again an by the time we reach Marks updated choose life monologue it's there because it's expected. Nothing spontaneous and it's like the words are even dubbed. Where's this going? Spuds now looking more like the author of the skag boys and Franco has now started to monologue #nocuntleavesheretillwefindwhatcuntdidit. I'm losing this next minute we're going to see Mark 'hypnotising chickens.' Amidst the final scenes we get a glimpse of a school playground and there's young kids that we start to recognise as once friends and I'm getting a bit choked up when the curly haired blonde kid appears in a freeze frame. it maybe tommy it may not. But it starting to feel like a funeral and I just want to leave the cinema now. Is it the film, the stark reality of my own life in a mirror through addiction, bad choices and lost youth? Should it never have been revisited in the first place, are some things so good you should never ever go back? 2 hours after leaving the cinema I'm now sat watching there them running out of WHSmiths down princess's as opposed to choosing mind numbing spirit crushing game shows... just made it worse. Days later and I'm still haunted by the film. What's up with me? I'm not reading this from other fans?

I am a huge fan of trainspotting, as are many, and the last thing I wanted to do was have to resort writing a review (this is my first and probably last) just to get the terror out of my head and the taste out of my mouth. I came away feeling like I'd been to the funeral of a friend of 20 years instead of the christening I was expecting. To attempt 'Porno' was obviously too much but even a nod to it would have been nice instead of nods to pulp fiction (get naked scene), goodfellas (car boot scene) and the worst of all The shining (mirrored room scene).

Competently filmed and acted, but not overall a great movie because of the script. I love the original, I've seen it a dozen times at least. This film relies on the viewer's nostalgia for the first without coming up with anything original, and despite my love for the original it failed to get me into it. The plot manages to feel meandering without much even happening, probably because it's paced terribly. Renton comes back to Scotland after 20 years, checks in on the characters, then tries to make money before escaping being murdered by Begbie. That's it, everything, the entire plot in one sentence! I couldn't sum up Trainspotting so quickly. This movie also has no real message or moral, aside from one line of dialogue which tries to shove feminism down your throat. Trainspotting had a very nuanced albeit cynical critique of society, not this one. I've never seen just a masturbatory piece of film before.

It's no where near as good as Trainspotting, the soundtrack if there is one is weak and doesn't add anything to the film. It's basically a load of three minute comedy sketches with little in the way of comedy, joined together on the basis that they were all once in a great film. Clips from the original film are not shown for long enough. The best story is Spuds, Ewen Bremner recreates the character as if he was 20 years older, but with the strange body moves and his amazing Scottish accent just like in the first film, Beggbie is no longer scarily menacing, he just swears more. So very disappointing but given the hype, the premier in Scotland and the countless appearances of the films actors and Danny Boyle on TV, Radio and press over the last few weeks it seems that poor films need this type of promotion to get some return on investment and some bums on cinema seats.",T2 Trainspotting

250,teguesln,To say I loved this movie would be an understatement. Brilliant.,10,23 February 2020,"This movie hit me really hard, without being over-the-top.
As many have said, it's a very different movie from the first, clearly made by a more mature director.
Back in the day, although I loved the music culture surrounding the first movie, I couldn't actually finish watching the whole movie. I got to the baby (when it was still alive), knew what was coming and had to stop watching.When the second movie came out, I knew it was going to be important for me to see it, so I forced myself to watch the whole of the first movie first before getting to the cinema to see T2. It traumatised me, honestly. I hate heroin with a passion, even though I'm very familiar with recovering addicts through a long history with other 12-step programs. That scream that the mother of the baby lets out - so horrible.This second movie - it just spoke to me so much. I've never been an addict in those ways but - I'm the same age as those characters and as an artist/musician, still at ground level and in fairly precarious circumstances. I just felt this movie had so much more depth, realism and maturity than the first one, and was really true to life. If you want to see a real version of where they'd really be at, this is believable enough.Of course I loved all the detail of the ways it was shot and FX, (eg. the George Best projection on the car driving back from the 1690 heist); and the very last scene (Renton's bedroom) was brilliant and an amazing way to end. I loved the way sound and music was used, beyond the soundtrack songs themselves - the slow winding up of Born Slippy slowed down which symbolised the old addiction response coming back to life re: memories too painful to endure, (end of the memorial scene, when Renton confronts Simon about what he did); and that Eno track Blue Day used when Renton wakes up on the billiard table, are two moments.But most of all - I absolutely loved Spud portrayed by Ewen Bremner. I loved the arc Danny gave him. Thank God there was that redemption as it would be bleak otherwise. It was a really great twist at the end, and so happy to see Spud, who is so loveable in this movie, find his talent and (at least in this canon) promise of a happier life going forward.I hated the heroin scene in this movie (thank God there was only one) although once again the projected deer were so effective, but at least Spud didn't use with them and just watched. I cared more about him than the other two so I could live with that.Ultimately, this movie made me go to Edinburgh. Three different times, actually (a long journey, from Australia!). I had to see where these characters lived and see Leith more closely for myself.
The city is absolutely amazing (even though filled with tourists from everywhere but Scotland) - you don't really see how amazing it is in the movie, although you see Arthur's seat, you don't see the scale of the old town and castle looming over everything and the gothic monuments/architecture everywhere. The newer city, built around the old, built around Arthur's seat. In such a small gathered-in area, really.And I loved Leith (even though it seems to be going through gentrification and massive development right now at the Pilrig end), and other suburbs I spent time in.So if my response is anything to go by, I'd say the film's a big win for British tourism.
I loved Danny's and John's take on where these characters are at now, obviously. And for me this is far and away better than the first film, even though I appreciate the first was more - groundbreaking from a filmmaking and storytelling perspective - this one was much realer for me and much closer to home. The first I found more sensational and gratuitous in treatment of heroin addiction. This one wasn't.Thanks Danny, you changed my life with this movie. Ewen I love you :-)
and please all of you don't make a third movie based on the new Irvine Welsh novel with these characters because no way am I down for seeing a movie where Spud dies (which I think is what happens in that book?). Please just don't do it.",T2 Trainspotting

253,darkod-1,As good as sequals go,7,8 January 2018,"Let's get the obvious in the clear right away - it cannot be compared to the original Trainspotting. For my generation, that was teen / adolescent in the nineties when it came out, Trainspotting was an instant classic - the story, the visual experience, the characters, the music. It survived the test of time as a one of those ""generational"" films that never goes out of style.Admittedly, T2 is trying very hard to establish the atmosphere of nostalgia - occasional flashbacks, sappy scenes where characters reminiscence the events from the first film. However, if we are honest with ourselves, nostalgia is the inevitable part of growing old. These characters are at a turning point in life, faced with the overwhelming burden of failure - as husbands, fathers, friends and individuals in general. Lifelong of fighting their addict past, trying to put together pieces of broken life. But, this is where this film actually shines - the representation of the demise of these characters is truly realistic. Their fall is never ""sugar-coted"" or softened; they are not given the ""ride into the sunset"" happy end. They are forced to (literally in the final showdown) look themselves in the mirror and face their failures. And this is exactly the charm of this movie - it gives you the loughs with the similar tone of dark humor that was present in the original, while creating that sour taste in your throat of watching people scratching at the walls of their lives trying to escape the misery of their past that is still haunting their existence. People who are not fans of the original will probably not appreciate it, younger audiences might be bored by it, but fans of the original who are similar age as the characters, who loved the original back in 96, might enjoy the throwback ride to Trainspotting dark humor lane for a farewell with the characters that left such an impression on us 20 years ago.",T2 Trainspotting
254,scrapbuster,"Not as great as it could have been, but definitely not as BAD as it could have been",8,18 October 2020,"Maybe it's partially nostalgia, and my love of the book(s), but I found this film fantastic. It certainly has problems. It's not mostly just based on Welsh's novels Glue, and Skagboys like people expected, although it has many elements from those novels. It also includes subplots that weren't in the original 1996 film (i.e. the explanation of Begbie's backstory, which is why the novel was called ""Trainspotting"" to begin with).While some subplots felt unnecessary or out of place in a Trainspotting film, and some things felt, for lack of a better term, ""tacked-on"" for sake of nostalgia and including characters that really didn't need to be there - not that I didn't appreciate seeing them back again, but it did feel somewhat unnecessary.The film was great, in my opinion. It probably could've been better, but it DEFINITELY could have been much, much worse. It doesn't live up to the original, but that would've been nearly impossible, seeing as it's such an incredible, beloved film.

It is member berries to the max, constantly referencing the original picture in a way that made me think they just didn't have anything original to say, nor a real point to make. The story line is unbelievable, the characters are super flat and their interactions stiff.

Danny Boyle wouldn't have much scope for excitement if all the cast were reformed or in rehab, so I liked how the characters ended-up, it was quite believable. Not everyone can change.As is the case with many modern sequels to classics, the film provided enough for fans of the original Trainspotting to refer back to, for example the soundtrack had many of the original songs tweaked and some characters made short cameos.

Go watch the original again.So we have Sickboy/Simon, who's doing a decent job of blackmailing folk, but from the original yeah that sounds about right.Spud, is still on heroin again sounds right, I read a review saying after a run he was off it, who said? Just never seen him take it...Begby, prison for 20 years sounds spot on, the break out was far fetched, but has happened in lesser programs.The interesting thing about Renton, is that he is clean, and throughout the film never gets back on the skag...For me it's the perfect progression for all of the main characters, put the nostalgia in and we have the perfect sequel, not as good as the first but pretty damn close. Before people criticize me for 10 ratings I don't hand em out regularly 3 so far 2 being Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.Remember guys, you're not doing what you did 20 years ago.",T2 Trainspotting
259,davidrichardson2010,Trainspotting T2. A worthy successor to Trainspotting 1 for the modern audience,8,22 May 2017,"Trainspotting, 1996. The first film was released at a time of transcendence between the vintage world and the modern. I was 16 back then and to say that the first film was popular with my generation is under cutting it somewhat. It was one of the defining films of my youth. So, hard act to follow, how did they do? That's for you to choose but for me it was not bad, not bad at all!The first thing i noticed was the colors. The palette of soft greens blurred and darker yellows and browns instantly took me back 20 yrs to T1. The movie people had done their homework on getting the vibe right. If they hadn't this updated version wouldn't have been worthy. From the first few scenes the love put in shines through the awesome soundtrack. We are treated to some very good music throughout.These positives were bolstered by good performances from McGregor and Carlisle but for me Johnny Lee Miller was the stand out. The character Veronica could have had a bit more screen time I thought though.The story was a little short paced in the middle third but I kept thinking this is becoming predictable and to my surprise it didn't. I was treated to an enjoyable time while viewing because it wasn't. You can see the folk that made it didn't just want to re create the first film and some new ideas are noticeable. One small gripe I had was that I felt the content had been watered down nanny state style a tad. Maybe that's to cater for the modern more PC savvy audience but to me the shock value in some of the first films scenes are what I remember from it the most. Who remembers the segment where Spud has his er...accident? I thought maybe this sequel should have added just a little more. That said though there was plenty to like.For me one of the best things from T1 was Rentons speech in the Born Slippy tune that accompanies that first one. If you share that feeling there will be a moment in T2 that you will definitely enjoy. I will say no more :)So what's become of Begby , Renton, Sick- Boy and Spud? Well as is for us all time has caught up a bit with our guys but some things are still unforgivable, still fresh and not forgotten. The heart beat the drives this movie is revenge and they do a good job connecting the 2 eras especially considering there's a full 2 decades between them.T2 is A good watch in all aspects and I would recommend it. It has good actors, an interesting story, great soundtrack and at times is very funny. but!... if you haven't seen it i would suggest you may want to watch T1 first. Of course it's entirely up to you to choose.....""Choose your future, choose life!""",T2 Trainspotting
260,Paul8033-65-566407,Choose Life!,9,7 February 2017,"I remember watching the first one of these two and being blown away. MY expectations here were a little bit mixed. I loved that there were the original cast with a follow on from the story line, importantly not trying to be an updated version of the previous picture. My concern was that it would be a bit lame because the first one was just brilliant. I need not have worried if you even enjoyed the first you will be ecstatic over the sequel. I loved the references back to the previous that are woven in and through the movie. I thought some of the direction was inspired, like when Renton first goes back home and is sitting in the kitchen with his dad and the shadows on the wall tell of his missing mum. The way that 'Spud's' character has been developed is inspired and he is again almost the innocent in this. When he bangs Begbey up the side of the head with the toilet I immediately thought of the first film's toilet scene. Man honestly I could go on about this for ages but I'm too lazy. One thing to add is how BRILLIANT is Renton's Choose Life! monologue, man Ewan McGregor nailed that one, it is a cert to become a massive hit on YouTube.",T2 Trainspotting
261,jmatstjb,T2: Trainspotting,10,12 June 2017,"A dark, but necessary film. The characters in the film are as haunted by the ghosts of the last twenty years, as much as this film was haunted by the ghost of the original Trainspotting from 1996. But, I realized that was the point. What happens when you have the nihilism of youth wear off into the bleakness of an adulthood of wasted potential? As the pain of nostalgia gets too great, what to look for but distraction and escape. 20 years on from the first Trainspotting, I definitely have a different perspective. To now look at characters that have, or have lost children it is a different mindset. You can't just waste away your time looking for that next distraction or fix. You have to live and provide for another person's life. With the passage of time involved, I found this movie to be like life itself: it's dark, f##ked up, funny, inspiring, dreadful, but also perfect. And the Choose Life speech ... holy s##t ... enough said. I could use one of those speeches every 10 to 20 years. Also, the last minute of the first film was phenomenal, I thought the last minute of T2 was perfect.",T2 Trainspotting

They didn't over complete the storyline. Acting was strong, and it was complimented by a good soundtrack and visuals.
I felt the vulnerabilities of each character was brought out very effectively, and with a sense of underlying humour. I actually enjoyed the movie despite having quite high expectations having seen the first one.

They have taken the bad parts of the book and left out all of the good stuff, i.e. no porno. Just four miserable guys who are unhappy with their lives.

265,guzz_,Great film,8,4 August 2017,I'm writing this as I'm nearing the end of the film. Its not as expected a sequel with lots of drugs etc. Its more of a trip down memory lane. It's like going down the pub with old friends with whom you haven't seen for a long time and reminiscing about the old times. It make you think about what has happened to yourself over the last 20 years. This is probably more relevant to people of my age who first saw the first film back in 1996. ( I saw it 3 times in the first week of launch) . Its a great film in its own right and has lots of very clever reminders of the original film.( Some of which you may not have spotted from the first film). I may need to watch it a couple of more times to pick them all up. Great job and worth the 20 year wait for a sequel.,T2 Trainspotting

It's a shame that Irvine Welsh also signed this movie, as for Danny Boyle as well, but anyways he has been in crisis since 127h and making pointless movies is a new trend for him. They literally raped characters that brought fame to this movie, used them and trowed their glory to the dump of movies I will never wish to watch again. Don't you understand that new generations now wont watch original movie and will remain in acknowledgment that this is just another stupid junkie movie that elders watched because they didn't have other choice? In a nutshell, pointless movie, not fun, not educating, not anything...Dusan",T2 Trainspotting
269,mattjkav,"A quite different vibe to part 1, and undeserved of the bad reviews",8,9 June 2017,"I was the key demographic for the first film when it was released. I somehow snuck into the theater a few years shy of being 18 (and legal) to see it, and it had the same effect on me that it did on so many. The slick production, now-iconic soundtrack, grimy aesthetic, grim humor - it hit me hard (pun intended). Of course at that age, as gen-x cynical and world-weary as I thought myself, I was naive. Drugs were still novel, I was yet to see how dark and sad an actual addiction would look like. On some unconscious level I felt like I would live forever. A misplaced sense of my own intrinsic genius would allow me to balance an appreciation of the seedier, self destructive elements of the world with the actuality of my own inevitable personal success. As such, I walked out of Trainspotting 1 with a spring in my step. It was fun, fast, clever and a quick and temporary tour through some really ugly things. It was 'cool'. Sequels to iconic movies are dangerous, and there are many that I've avoided simply due to the knowledge that I'd rather not sully a great film's memory by adding to it a mediocre sequel. T2 was the same - I'd toyed with seeing it in the theater, but when that never eventuated, I was fairly unfazed. Tonight, feeling a little sleepless and lonely in my single room apartment, I stumbled upon a copy and thought 'why not?'. I knew that the reviews has oscillated between 'quite bad' to 'surprisingly good' but in a fit of downbeat nostalgia, I thought it might fit the bill. And it did.It wont be remembered with the reverence of the first film. I don't believe that Boyle made it under that assumption. It contains some great sequences, some similar (if familiar) visual effects, and a heap of well-integrated allusions to the earlier film. It doesn't have anything with the cut-through of the baby scene, the toilet scene, the (original) 'choose life' monologue. It is a more subdued, 'adult' and downbeat film. So - if you are a teenager who has recently seen the first film and are chasing the gut-punch intensity by watching the sequel, I can almost guarantee you'll fell let down. Conversely, if you've aged with the film, I suspect you'll find a good degree of resonance with the film. The genius of the film is how it manages to be a deeper, more emotional, more (god forbid) 'mature' take on life. At nearly-forty you probably don't party like you did in your 20's. Drugs are out, or few and far between. Meeting nubile 20 year olds is also out, or if not, feels seedy. You no longer find revolutionary new music weekly. IN fact, half of the songs on radio just alienate you. Despite the mixed blessings of this unforeseen middle -aged-ness you've found yourself shouldering, you are still a little haunted by what was, and what could have been. The wonderful moments of being young, the mistakes, the missed opportunities, the near-misses, the opportunities and betrayal. They don't leave you. If you can appreciate any of what I just wrote, you may (like I do) find T2 to be a very close second to T1. It's a real downer, but in a bittersweet way. Check it out.",T2 Trainspotting
270,isaacleonardovargas,Of course it would not have the same tone the original had!,8,22 March 2017,"I will start by saying that people who think the T2 will follow the same dark and shallow lives of the four main characters will be disappointed. I've seen many people complain about the point of the second movie, I'm sorry to say that 20 years have passed, and one must expect the characters to change/evolve in a way. They/we (who saw the movie years ago :)) are no longer kids, they battle frustration and despise for themselves and their choices in life.The movie is funny in its own -more light- than the original- way, and I do think that the portrayal of all characters was spot on, I would definitely believe that these same guys lived on 20 years and that was the result. The cinematography was excellent, it seems to me that a lot of love and passion was invested in this sequel by actors and director alike.Finally, the nostalgia. As a person who grew influenced by this movie and this generation, I can definitely relate to many things I saw and experienced in this movie, and in the end I left the theater thinking for many more hours about the movie and the characters. A satisfying conclusion.",T2 Trainspotting
271,acapuano,Awful,4,31 July 2019,"This sequel was disappointing, not only in respect to its predecessor, but also as a stand-alone film. The uninspired plot was clearly conjured up to play off of the nostalgia its audience would have for the first film, and it is executed badly. In the past 20 years the main characters have supposedly developed a lot, but seemingly uncharacteristically. It has none of the charm of the original Trainspotting, and the filming is arrogant; I'm sure the cinematographer was convinced he was a genius, curating a work of art. In reality, the filming is obvious and pretentious, constantly trying to be unique but completely failing and taking away from the scenes. The soundtrack was simply awful, some of the worst pop songs to assault my ears, when good music should be a very integral part of any film. The film seemed to want to scream ""This is 20 years later, SO MUCH has changed"" and tried to say this through a dedicated focus on technology which had nothing to do with the film whatsoever. I'm sure they got a fat endorsement for the montage in which Mark and Simon play with Snapchat filters. The full duration of the movie I could not stop thinking about how bad it was, I hated the film.",T2 Trainspotting
272,jamesmccarthy,Left me cold,4,22 May 2017,No warmth. I can't relate to any of the characters. I have no interest in any of them either. This movie was wery stylized but it has no heart. Such a missed opportunity.The last time Danny Boyle or any of them were on a train was probably before the release of the first movie and it shows.George Lucas syndrome all day long unfortunately.,T2 Trainspotting
273,dsumner-04263,The sequel that Trainspotting always deserved,9,10 February 2017,"Like many fans, I was extremely cautious about getting over-hyped about T2 when the announcement was made. The original novel is my favourite book, and the sequel Porno (while enjoyable) simply didn't hit me in the same places as Trainspotting and prequel Skagboys.Fortunately, Boyle was of the same mind and T2 throws out a tremendous amount of the source material while retaining key elements. Indeed, the novel's main plot which centered around Sick Boy and Rents producing a pornographic movie is almost entirely absent.Instead, we get a heartfelt examination of wasted potential. Trainspotting ended with Renton fleeing his junkie life and starting over in Amsterdam, a feel-good ending to an incredibly dark story. T2 returns him to Edinburgh, his 15-year marriage in pieces, his career finished, his mother dead, his former best friends still drug addicts and psychopaths, and his attempt at a better life ultimately a failure. With nothing left, he dives back into the pit of manipulation and drugs that he escaped from so triumphantly two decades prior. The stylistic choices of Boyle are as unique and pleasant as ever, the most notable being his extensive use of flashbacks to the original movie. This adds an incredible sense of emotional depth to the story's main theme of lost youth, particularly in one scene where Sick Boy, Renton and Spud return to the countryside (site of Renton's classic ""It's shite being Scottish!"" monologue) to collectively pay tribute to their dead friend Tommy. For a brief few seconds, they gaze into the distance and we flash back to Tommy walking the hill. This, for me, had more emotional impact than any other moment in the movie.Overall T2 is a reflection on a group of lives that, despite diverging heavily from convict to junkie to pimp to 9-to-5 married life, have all ended in mediocrity and failure. Where Trainspotting was a story of moving forward and choosing life, T2 is a story of wistful retrospection. The sequel could never live up to the magnificence and promise of its youth and, in a way, that's the whole point.",T2 Trainspotting

Independent and respectful to its predecessor while standing on its own merits as a great movie, art even, powerful maybe. 20 years on things have changed,mostly. It's funny,sad and mature above all else. Boyles directing is complemented with a great script and beautiful cinematography. On to the important aspects, the film plays cleverly With nostalgia without depending on it,giving the audience of the 1996 cult classic something to savor, while also standing independently as an entertaining and even inventive film. Performances are a solid as you'd expect, Robert Carlyle returns in a fantastic albeit expected performance as begbie. The film introduces the advancement in technology over the intervening years with inventive and clever special effects, however the original also boasted some amazing trick of the lens. Finally upon leaving the cinema one gets a feeling of bittersweet and sorrowful fulfillment, the characters we've come to know over the last 20 years hive us nearly two hours of nostalgia packed entertainment, yet one can't help but long for its energetic,frenetic and classic predecessor, no matter how good its sequel is, and it is.",T2 Trainspotting

All those bits were either a) left to the imagination or b) answered within 20 mins/the trailer to T2.The one genuinely massive scene was Spud watching his best mates shooting up, but that was somehow glossed over - kind of the whole point of T1, but forgotten in T2.Gutted",T2 Trainspotting

There are a few moments of brilliance but too few to carry the film which bears little to no relationship with Porno, though I suspect too much time had passed to make Welch's sequel book into a workable script - re-releasing Porno as the book which T2 is based upon is stretching the truth into an alternative fact. The music too is weak in comparison and the better tracks here having appeared in the original.

It was great to see all the characters on the screen again, they have not lost their personalities, that I was pleased with. It had the same familiar gritty feel as the original but I found the film to be rather lacking, empty and a series of short uninteresting or non entertaining scenes. Not the constant flow of the original, not that i really expected that but it would have been an easier watch. Really not sure about the soundtrack, a mixed choice of tracks such as High Contrast – 'Shotgun Mouthwash' which did not fit with the scenes and great well known tracks which did suit, you can't go wrong with a bit of Queen, Blondie or The Clash.

By no means a bad film, just a very tough act to follow.What I enjoyed most about the original was the seamless flow of the fantastic story line and the outstanding music choices.T2 came across as a stuttered plot, and disjointed story. In regards to the disappointing music, maybe that says more about modern music rather than poor choices from Danny Boyle.It was great to see the characters again after 20 years. All solid actors in their own right.I'm sure I will watch T2 again & enjoy it more on my second visit. As a movie standing by itself without comparison- it's fine. OK. Standard. Acceptable.

I will keep it short. There is no proper story line.Obvious lack of inspiration,everything seem unfinished,rushed,covered in nostalgia for old times. There is no flow and atmosphere that we remember from the first and for me only Trainspotting. On the top of everything there is a lot of ""reminders"" with the scenes from the first movie. In one word whole movie is based on nostalgia and doesn't keep your attention at all.Actors are to old to play these characters,there is no energy there anymore. Spud's character is the only one played with the same old enthusiasm. Veronica is new completely useless character,I have no idea what's the point of having her there quite frankly.

280,benthomas-49424,Disappointing,4,1 February 2017,"Trainspotting, the iconic film from my youth. I have been looking forward to the sequel with the eager anticipation of a junkie who just got their hands on some of Afghanistan's finest. As my belt loosened, I slumped back into the large leather sofa, glazed eyes fixed on the screen and full of warm contentment for the hit I was about to receiveIndeed 'T2' was a trip down memory lane - a contrived trip down a lane that meandered meaninglessly without any apparent beginning or end. A lane with more p(l)ot holes than the cobbled backstreets of Leith. To reassemble the original cast was a coup that ensured those who loved the original would flock to see the sequel and spend their cash to get another dose of the good stuff. But this time it was hard to relate to those same characters that had oozed so much charisma in the original. It felt like they were all trying just that little bit too hard, likely in an effort to atone for the distinct lack of plot and skittish direction this instalment offered.As the movie jumped from one gratifying, yet ultimately self-serving piece of cinematography to the next, it became clear that 'T2' lacked a thread from which to hang the heavily affected nostalgia that felt obvious, yet pretentious. The original appealed to the disaffected youth of the working classes and way beyond; the sequel felt like it had been conceived to appeal to the conceited masses who 'Chose life. a job. a career. a familyand that 3-piece suite' a long time ago - and it lacked substance as a result. Maybe I was too comfortable, drinking my large glass of Rioja on the comfy £16 sofa-seat to really engage – or maybe I was just too pisshed But as the anticipation waned, I realised this wasn't the real-deal. The injection of wonder I was hoping for turned out to be nothing more than a sugary-sweet placebo that left me disappointed and in need of more.

I suspect my high expectations come from being the same age as the characters in the film now and consequently the nostalgia factor comes into play.The film lacked laughs, the cringe factor that the original had in places and any connection to the characters and it would have been best not made.

The first film was just about action and setting the mood, the last was meant to teach us something. So if you haven't seen the first don't go to see the second one!I'd compare those two films as the first was witty and goofy and the second was dark, serious yet straightforward. You'll laugh as our main characters have their opportunities and still manage to f*ck up just because they are addicted to something, you'll see how their friendship is built on betrayal, you will see literally how the 4th wall will be torn down and you'll understand how Danny Boyle and Irvene Welsh were laughing over You the whole time.Yeah, you could say that how the second film is too linear but that is the point - they had to get the point across to addicts, to You! Of course they hid many deeper meanings and references from the first one throughout the whole film to get the point across even more clearer. And if you know that you don't like films with hidden symbols and meanings, don' even bother watchin' this shite.It is film about addiction and choosing because we are free... You are free!

It was never going to be better than the first one because that is a classic masterpiece. I found the characters like Spud more interesting and like they had a proper backstory. Spoiler!!Spud got fired by his work and that was the start of a slippy slope. His Girlfriend left him along with his Son being ashamed of his being a father. This then causes Spud to return to Heroin addiction which later results in Spud trying to kill himself with a paper bag over his head.

290,saramickhughes,Really???,1,6 October 2017,"Read the book it's very loosely based on, then watch the film again. Gutted. Book is awesome. Film is absolute rubbish. 2 hours of my life lost. Book is ""Porno"" Irvine Welsh. Really disappointed although Begbie getting his comeuppance at the end cheered me up. And spud being successful for a change. Book is pure genius like the first trainspotting film, sick boy gets ripped off again and Renton runs off with the girl. Please read!!",T2 Trainspotting
291,jamesalexander-87380,Whats the fuss about???,2,17 October 2017,The film has no real plot and just meanders around from start to finish. It is the most pointless film I have ever seen and I found it rather boring.I have not seen the original trainspotting which may have influenced my opinion but there is no way of getting around the fact that there is no real plot.Would not recommend watching as it is a waist of time.,T2 Trainspotting
292,ananbuban,Disappointment,1,22 October 2017,"We can see the routine application of the formula including some disgusting scenes blended with some nice cinematographic elements. Nothing more this time tho, no spirit. Watched first 30 minutes and had to stop, because it was boring unlike the first movie. Decided to watch the rest today, got disgusted totally.Another masterpiece brought down by *3 letters* media. I will not write that 3 letters here because will get banned regardless. Message is obvious for the ones who can understand. Stay off.",T2 Trainspotting
