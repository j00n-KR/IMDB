0,TheLittleSongbird,"A little too long, but original, sassy and smart, with an outstanding Hayley Mills",8,3 June 2010,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I do prefer it over the remake. The remake was really nice too, but this has a more special place in my heart. It is a little too long however, and there are one or two moments in the film that could have been less padded such as the interlude at the summer camp.That said, The Parent Trap is a really engaging film, it is sassy, funny and smart with an original concept. The film is really beautiful to look at too, lovely cinematography, costumes and scenery. Another nice component was the music, really tuneful and sweet and most of all memorable.The script is funny, sharp and smart, there is some witty dialogue and also some touching parts too. The direction is equally adept and skillful, David Swift also guided Hayley Mills through her Oscar-winning turn in Pollyanna the previous year.Then there is the acting. Hayley Mills is outstanding in the dual roles of the twins who try to reunite their divorced parents. I first encountered Mills in Tiger Bay, a very underrated film that is and she was just brilliant in it, in fact her performance in that film is one of my all-time favourite child performances. Let's not forget the other actors either, Brian Keith is fine as the father though he could have done with more material, and the stunning Maureen O'Hara is a delight as the mother. There's also Leo G.Carroll, who I am familiar with from his supporting turns in Hitchcock films like Suspicion and Spellbound, it was nice to see him again.Overall, I liked this film very, very much. Not perfect by all means but a delight nonetheless. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Parent Trap
1,bkoganbing,Let's Get The Folks Together,6,5 November 2008,"Looking at The Parent Trap over 40 years from when I first saw it in the theater I can see why it was such a hit in more innocent times. It's cute and clever and certainly fulfills a wish fantasy about kids from a broken home longing to get their parents back together. Looking at it now though, I wonder if Walt Disney might have been perpetuating a bad fantasy on a generation.This was Hayley Mills's second film and third with Disney and in The Parent Trap she takes her Pollyanna, doubles it, and brings it up to the beginning of the New Frontier. She plays twins, separated at birth, each going to live with one parent and neither knowing of the other's existence. They meet at summer camp and switch places the better to get to know the part of their life they've missed. It works out well for the one who goes with Maureen O'Hara, but the one with Brian Keith discovers that Brian's head is being turned by a mercenary Joanna Barnes on the prowl whose mother reminds her about California's beautiful community property laws.This means getting Maureen from Boston to California and revealing all in an attempt to put mom and dad back together again.Maureen O'Hara made her one and only film with Disney with The Parent Trap and in her memoirs she and Walt quarreled because her contract specified first billing. She did not like Hayley Mills being first billed. But she decided not to pursue legal action as Walt threatened to blackball her. He was powerful enough to do it and did do it to a few people. She liked her co-stars though and was especially fond of Brian Keith. There are a lot of laughs in The Parent Trap with the girls first not liking each other in summer camp. And later on Joanna Barnes goes on the camping trip to hell courtesy of the Hayleys. I've got to say no matter what else happens they helped good old Brian dodge a bullet in the form of Joanna Moore.But you know how many kids in 1961 and later on Disney's prime time television program saw The Parent Trap and thought that too could plot a good scheme to bring divorced parents back? I wonder how many were disappointed in that way.Part of the bad side of The Magic Kingdom.",The Parent Trap
2,Hitchcoc,"Hailey, Hailey, and More Hailey",7,8 December 2016,"There isn't much here that is new. We have a woman (who isn't a bad woman) invading the space of a couple of teenagers who are out to keep her away from their father. Hailey Mills plays both the girls (twins) with their tight curly blonde hair. They can barely carry a tune but they sing anyway, and that song has become part of the eternal movie culture. What happens is a series of tricks pulled on the unsuspecting woman (who really has no sense of humor so makes a good foil) to show that she and the dad have nothing in common. Some of what they do is downright cruel and mean spirited. I guess we enjoy it because we want the father to be happy too. Just a bit of fluff from the Disney studios.",The Parent Trap
3,mark.waltz,Disney avoids the run of the Mills!,7,15 July 2017,"Taking a cue from ""A Summer Place"" to appeal to both adults and teens, this Disney comedy is a charming reminder of what was once known as family night out. There's two Hayley Mills for the price of one for the teens (fresh from ""Pollyanna"") and the still sexy Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith as their divorced parents for the adults. This family affair busted up years before thanks to the inability to come to terms with their differences, and the decision for each of the parents to get custody of one of the twin girls, now precocious, boy crazy teens.Unaware that they have a look alike, the very differently brought up young ladies meet at summer camp where it's hate at first sight. Not seeing the similarity in their voices, they don't question that until they are confined together after getting into a cat fight. The two plot to switch places, one ending up in stuffy Boston and the other in sunny California, plotting to get the parents together after a long separation in an effort to rekindle the spark. But with daddy Keith on the verge of marrying an obvious gold digger (a delightfully bitchy Joanna Barnes), they must connive quickly!Disney rarely did better outside their big musicals than they did here, including a fantastic cast of character actors who are all unique and very funny. There's Cathleen Nesbitt as O'Hara's imperious mother, Charles Ruggles as O'Hara's henpecked father, Una Merkel as Keith's plain spoken housekeeper, and Ruth McDeavitt and Nancy Kulp as summer camp moderators. Leo G. Carroll stifles an amusing chuckle watching all the craziness unfold as the minister planning on marrying Keith and Barnes. Having often quoted her ping pong ball monologue from ""Auntie Mame"", I adored Barnes here, but then again, there's absolutely nothing to dislike. Well, that is except the song that Mills sings as a duet in the reconciliation scene with the parents. It instantly dates the film, but the sequences where the twins take on the nasty Barnes in the middle of the woods makes up for it. This has been remade twice, but for me, nothing bests the original.",The Parent Trap
4,gavin6942,A Disney Classic,7,10 January 2017,"Hayley Mills plays twins who, unknown to their divorced parents, meet at a summer camp. Products of single parent households, they switch places (surprise!) so as to meet the parent they never knew, and then conspire to reunite them.This is an undisputed Disney classic. And what makes it great, beyond just being a known classic, is how it appeals to a wide age range. There is something for the kids, but there are also some risqué jokes that may be better appreciated by adults. Some hanky-panky suggestions, for example.Sadly, I had actually seen the 1998 version first. I like that version, but I really wish I had watched them in order. There are also apparently a handful of sequels to the original, but I can't say I'm nearly as excited about them.",The Parent Trap
5,lee_eisenberg,"this movie has a significance for the era in which my parents came of age, but it's not the significance that you were thinking of",2,2 November 2013,"For the most part, I watched ""The Parent Trap"" just so that I could heckle it like Mike, Servo and Crow do the movies that Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank send them on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". I'm most proud of referring to the woman with the surname Robinson as the character in ""The Graduate"".But what this movie really represents is what was thought of as ""acceptable"" and ""decent"" entertainment. Before too long, the Beatles arrived, causing a torrent of movies and music that old-school people didn't consider ""acceptable"" or ""decent"". It got to the point where the ""unacceptable"" and ""indecent"" stuff got accepted as a general part of popular culture (good old parable of the leopards!). As in my parents' era, so in my era. ""Acceptable"" and ""decent"" culture used to be movies like ""Home Alone"", but soon it was ""American Beauty"".The point is, this is the sort of movie at which I roll my eyes. I see that there was a remake starring Lindsay Lohan. We all see what a wreck Lohan became.",The Parent Trap
6,ma-cortes,"Amusing , funny and entertaining family comedy with a sensational Hayley Mills",6,2 May 2007,"This is an agreeable updating from an E. Kastner's story , it deals about two twins little girls (Hayley Mills). When they are in summer holidays and after several antics each other , discover the surprise which they are twin sisters and then they plot change characters with their different parents (Mauren O'Hara , Brian Keith) who are disjointed since the divorce and the girls have been separately raised . The father is going to marry a young woman (Joanna Barnes) and the eleven-years-old girls scheme the parents reconciliation by making impossible life of the father's bride .The picture contains enjoyable comedy , humor , tongue-in-cheek and being pretty entertaining . This classical Disney comedy was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan and previously adapted to British cinema in a movie titled : ¨Twice upon a time¨ (1954) . Hayley Mills acting is sympathetic and amusing . Hayley plays two sisters and she makes it splendidly . Hayley starred two sequels for Television (1986, 1989). Susan Henning took on the role as Hayley Mills' body double for several of the twin shots in the film , as part of her contract, she signed away her rights to be credited . The screenplay originally called for only a few trick photography shots of Hayley Mills in scenes with herself; the bulk of the film was to be shot using a body double. When Walt Disney saw how seamless the processed shots were , he ordered the script reconfigured to include more of the special effect . Mauren O'Hara and Brian Keith are magnificent as parents in similar roles later starred by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid . Joanna Barnes as the unpleasant fiancée is very well , in the remake she played the bride's (incarnated by Elaine Hendrix) mother . The movie will appeal to family comedy enthusiasts . Rating : Amusing and enjoyable . Well worth seeing .",The Parent Trap
7,moonspinner55,"A bit brash and overlong, but otherwise extremely enjoyable",9,2 September 2001,"Pleasant whiff of an idea (twin teen girls--separated by their divorcing parents shortly after birth--find each other at summer camp and plan to reunite their folks) gets a big boost not only from the colorful players but by gorgeous photography and production (check out that home in California!). Hayley Mills is very persuasive as lookalike troublemakers Susan and Sharon--and if she gets a little shrill at times, that's OK because her manner is still very likable and, let's face it, she's adorable singing ""Let's Get Together (Yeah Yeah Yeah)"". Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are perfect as Mills' parents, the supporting cast is a wonderful collection of screwballs, and the finale (though it takes a while in coming) is very uplifting. An energetic and happy Disney enterprise, quite memorable and eons better than the recent remake. ***1/2 from ****",The Parent Trap
8,wes-connors,Walt Disney Doubles Hayley Mills,5,28 December 2010,"Pretty short-haired Hayley Mills (as Susan Evers) and pretty long-haired Hayley Mills (as Sharon McKendrick) meet at camp and discover they are twins who were separated at birth by divorcing parents Brian Keith (as Mitch) and Maureen O'Hara (as Maggie). At first, the thirteen-year-old girls don't get along, but they soon become fast friends. It doesn't take too much thinking to figure out the plot from here. The twins decide to switch places and bring their parents back together, since neither remarried. But, they must first stop Mr. Keith from marrying gold-digger Joanna Barnes (as Vicky Robinson)...After looking at Maureen O'Hara, I'd consider marrying her. After looking at Mr. Keith's California estate, I'd consider marrying him, too. So, I guess these parents stayed single because, at Ms. Mills deduces, they really do love each other. They sure fight like an old married couple. Why they separated their daughters, and hid them from each other, is inexplicable. While it's never revealed, the daughters must have spent many years in British finishing schools, without running into each other. The ""split-screen"" is very good, but Mr. Keith's hairpiece does not match properly. Okay, I'm marrying Hayley Mills.***** The Parent Trap (6/12/61) David Swift ~ Hayley Mills, Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, Joanna Barnes",The Parent Trap
9,BandSAboutMovies,Fun!,8,15 July 2021,"Based upon the 1949 book Lottie and Lisa by Erich Kästner, The Parent Trap is the kind of movie Disney made in the early 60s - sure, it's funny and financially successful, but it also has the kind of high quality that gets a movie nominated for two Academy Awards.Teenage girls Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers (both Hayley Mills) meet at Miss Inch's Summer Camp for Girls* and they hate one another near instantly. Their outright anger at the fact that one another even exists leads to a fight that destroys the annual summer dance, which lands them in isolation for the rest of the summer. That's when they find out that they are twin sisters who were split up by their parents, Mitch Evers (Brian Keith) and Maggie McKendrick (Maureen O'Hara, who only made one movie for Disney because they billed Mills over her). Yes, in the non-family court world of the Parent Trap, child custody is as simple as simply taking the child you want and never communicating with each other - much less letting the kids know their twin exists - ever again, which really feels like mental child abuse.But hey! Let's have fun! The girls decide that they want to see the other parent they are missing, so a haircut and some studying up on each others' lives goes down and before you know it, Sharon is Susan and Susan is Sharon. If this sounds kind of like The Patty Duke Show, well - they were cousins and producer, writer and creator Sidney Sheldon spent a week with star Duke and discovered she had two very different personalities, which led to his concept of identical cousins. Not to get super dark - I mean, I already talked about mentally abusing children, so why not, right? - but years later, those two sides of Patty's personality would be explained because she had manic depression. And yet a hot dog made her lose control!But I digress...As they switch lives, Sharon as Susan learns that Mitch is getting married to a younger woman who only wants his money (Joanna Barnes, who went to the same school and won the same poetry award as Sylvia Plath; a magazine article that she wrote convinced her to become an actress. In a neat moment of serendipity - which is not just the isolation cabin that Sharon and Susan work out their differences in - Barnes would play the mother of her character's daughter in the Lindsay Lohan-starring remake, which not only puts it in the same universe as this film, but supposes a monumental coincidence where Barens' character would meet two sets of families with two sets of separated twins. I am not good at math but I cannot even calculate how big of an improbably integer this must be). That's when the girls conspire to bring their parents - who literally seem like they want to outright murder one another, which means their arrdvarking must be volcanic and always make twins - back together.This movie has everything you want out of live-action Disney. An unreal situation in the real world. Songs by Richard and Robert Sherman. A love story. And plenty of sequels that didn't come out until the 80s and involved Sharon hooking up with Tom Skerritt, Susan getting down with Barry Bostwick and a honeymoon to Vegas. There's the aforementioned remake, a Disney+ series in production and more than one cover movies of The Parent Trap made in India, including 1965's Kuzhandaiyum Deivamum and 1966's Leta Manasulu, both of which star Kutty Padmini.*Mrs. Inch is Ruth McDevitt, who was bird shop owner Mrs. MacGruder in The Birds. You can also find Nancy Culp in a pre-Beverly Hillbillies role as one of the counselors.",The Parent Trap
10,michaelRokeefe,Original Disney double fluff.,5,21 July 2007,"Quite a novelty in its day. Looking at it now...sanitary and well...Disney; and I don't imply that in a bad way. Hayley Mills plays identical twins Sharon and Susan long separated because of their parent's divorce. Their parents being Mitch(Brian Keith)and Maggie(Maureen O'Hara), who down deep still have feelings for each other. The twins switch identities with the mission to get their parents back together. Standing in the way is Mitch's fiancé Vicky(Joanna Barnes); but one camping trip allows the twins to run her off. Heartwarming comedy for the entire family. Supporting cast includes: Charles Ruggles, Frank De Vol, Leo G. Carroll and Nancy Kulp.",The Parent Trap
11,AlsExGal,Probably the best of Disney's live action features BUT...,8,10 July 2016,"... is anybody else but me disturbed by the entire premise? Two people divorce, for reasons never spoken in the film, and they literally divide the child in half ala Solomon. One baby of their identical twin girls goes to dad (Brian Keith), and the other to mom (Maureen O'Hara). Not only in the first ten odd years of their lives does neither parent ever see (you don't know if they inquire via the other parent) the other child, they deny to both children the knowledge that they have a sibling! What judge would sign off on this deal? Wouldn't grandparents intervene or try to sneak a peak at the other grandchild in all of this time? Disney seems to have created a world where none of these questions are asked and the parents are free to write up any child custody agreements they care to arrange in a vacuum.Into this rather bizarre arrangement comes a summer camp to mess everything up. The two children end up at the same camp at the same time! Again, big screw up by the parents. One has been raised in upper crust Boston, the other on a ranch in Monterrey. Thus they have nothing in common but their looks. They cause trouble for each other with their pranks, until things escalate to the point that they are punished by being forced to live together in the same cabin in the woods. There they figure out they are sisters. So, now that they are each curious about their other parent, they decide turnabout is fair play and go back home to the parent they have never seen with each masquerading as the other.The thing that upends their plans is that dad is getting ready to remarry. Now every synopsis I have seen describes bride-to-be Vicki as a golddigger, but let's face it. It's not like Gerry Hall is marrying Rupert Murdock here. Dad is not that rich and not that old. He could live a long time and he could go broke. It was just a plot device to get the girls to reveal their switcheroo and thus get mom to fly to California and get the parents talking again, and to have an excuse for the girls not to like their stepmother to be, whose only problem seems to be that she is just not the outdoors type to be living on a ranch. And let's face it, the girls wouldn't like their new stepmom if she was Mary Poppins because she would be busting up their dreams of a reunified family.So how does this end? I'll let you watch and find out. I will say in the film's defense that it has a great two-tiered script with slapstick and adolescent humor for the kids and plenty of whimsy for the adults. The sentiment is genuine and not saccharine and the veterans in the cast give it plenty of gravitas, and kudos to Hayley Mills for making me forget that I wasn't looking at two different little girls. Just don't THINK too hard, because it ruins everything.",The Parent Trap
12,HotToastyRag,Darling double role for Hayley,6,25 April 2018,"The darling Hayley Mills plays twin sisters in the original The Parent Trap! Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith get divorced when the girls are babies, and in a bizarre custody settlement, the twins are split up between the parents. Each girl grows up with only one parent and with no knowledge of their twin's existence. Until summer camp. . . Hayley and Hayley notice a slight resemblance and put the pieces together. Then, to play a trick on their parents and, well, trap them into getting remarried, the girls switch places! In true Disney fashion, the pranks are pretty harmless and sweet, and the Maureen and Brian catch onto their kids' plans. But in true Disney fashion, the story manages to capture your heart anyway.I grew up watching the remake, so I think one's preference depends on the generation. The 1961 version is cute, but I remember seeing the 1998 version in the theaters, and it'll always be my favorite. If you didn't grow up in the nineties, you might like the sixties one better, so give it a whirl and see which one you like!",The Parent Trap
13,SimonJack,"A promising star, a good comedy and pioneering film work",8,26 November 2016,"""The Parent Trap,"" is the third film in Hayley Mills' young career, and her second with Walt Disney. She made her film debut in 1959 with her father, John Mills, in a British mystery-thriller, ""Tiger Bay."" Disney then signed her to a five-year contract. Her American film debut was in 1960 in ""Pollyanna."" After its success, the making of ""Parent Trap"" in 1960 proved to be a test for Mills and the whole Disney studio. Most people will know the plot of this film. It's based on a German story by Erich Kastner. Mills is delightful in her dual role as twin sisters, Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick. Beyond the strange situation of parents divorcing and separating their twin daughters shortly after birth, this film has an endearing story and a script to match it. The roles of her parents are played very well by Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith, as Maggie McKendrick and Mitch Evers. Mitch is the source of much of the humor. A fine supporting cast adds to the luster of the film, and a good amount of the humor. Joanna Barnes is very funny as Vicky Robinson, Leo G. Carroll is hilarious as Rev. Dr. Mosby, and Charles Ruggles is warmly humorous as the maternal grandfather, Charles McKendrick. Of course, the twins (Hayley and Hayley) are perpetrators of many of the humorous situations. Mills went on to make several successful films with Disney and the major studios until 1976. Her film career fizzled at the age of 30 after she married a director 33 years her senior in 1971. Roy Boulting's management of her career led to some poor movies. So, at an age when many stars are ascending the ladder and just beginning their best years, Hayley Mills' film career was all but washed up. She and Boulting divorced in 1976, but she never recovered even a part of her star status in film. She made just a few films after that over the years. Those were interspersed with appearances in several TV series, and her return to the stage. She returned for a sequel to ""The Parent Trap,"" a TV movie in 1989. Mills received no major acting awards or nominations beyond the mid-1960s. She was the last person to receive an honorary Academy Award Juvenile Oscar – in 1961 for ""Pollyanna."" She won a Golden Globe in 1960 for ""Pollyanna"" as most promising female newcomer; and she won the BAFTA award as most promising newcomer in 1959 for ""Tiger Bay."" She was nominated for Golden Globes in 1963 (for ""The Parent Trap"" of 1961) and 1964 (for ""Summer Magic"" of 1963). ""The Parent Trap"" is a popular film many decades after its making, and it will likely remain so well into the future, for three reasons. First is the timeless nature of the story. Second – Disney put it in settings that are still familiar well into the 21st century. And third, because of its technical achievements for which it remains one of the best film examples. This was one of the first films to use a single actor in two roles – as twins. A number of different techniques were used to shoot the twins. Disney special effects guru, Ub Iwerks, pioneered many technical advances in the film industry, beginning with the split screen technique in this film.It wasn't until years later that the public learned of a double who was used for the film. Susan Henning so closely resembled Hayley Mills that she played the opposite twin in all the scenes when only one was facing the camera. But, scenes in which both twins faced the camera, called for the split screen. These scenes were shot twice, with each girl switching roles. That meant complete costume and prop exchanges. In each shoot, the film is exposed only on the half in which Hayley is the character. Thus, when the film was processed, the two performers would be the same person – Hayley. There was much more detail to get this right and to match, and a 2002 bonus featurette with the movie goes into that. In it, Susan Henning-Schutte said she didn't mind being uncredited. She said she had a ball with Hayley and that it was a fun project for the whole cast and studio. Of course, no one knew all the details when this film came out in 1961, and audiences just figured it was the ""magic"" of Hollywood being able to shoot the same person as twins and putting it on the screen. For all that the public knew this film starred Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills. A modern Disney DVD release has two films – this one and ""The Parent Trap II"" of 1989. And, it comes with a separate disc that has bonus material. The short documentaries on the latter are well worth the time to watch. ""Caught in the Act: The Making of the Parent Trap"" tells how the film came about and was made. ""Who's the Twin"" delves into the challenges of filming the same person as twins. Another short is on the Sherman Brothers and the songs for the film. And, there's much more with interviews of stars and crew members, mixed with snippets of Walt Disney and production stills. It's a nice bonus for those who are interested in the art and craft of making movies.",The Parent Trap

Brian Keith is always a terrific actor & playing dad seems so natural for him as he does it again in Family Affair on CBS later. Maureen O'Hara is a great mom & it is difficult to every think of a film she was in that she wasn't good.Not only is this movie good entertainment, but the story is done at a leisurely pace which allows for most possible comic effect & also for most touching emotional strings as this film has a heart of gold to go with the comedy.In support, lets not forget Nancy Kulp (Miss Jane on the Beverly Hillbillies) & Leo G Carroll (TV's Topper & in Man From UNCLE) who provide some of the mass talent in this particular Disney film.",The Parent Trap
15,lasttimeisaw,THE PARENT TRAP proves to be a delightful confection when Disney is very much in its winsome wheelhouse,7,1 July 2019,"Not the Lindsay Lohan 1998 remake but the original Disney bonanza starring Hayley Mills, re-teamed with director David Swift from her breakout POLLYANNA (1960) one year prior, it is a wholesome family jewel that can appeal to kids and adults alike.But, there is a catch here, in order to pull off the identical twins separated at birth premise, a logical reason behind their parents' seemingly cruel decision of keeping a lid on the truth as if they never give a toss about another half of the twins, must be propounded, only the result is not quite satisfactory, temperamental incongruity is a way-too-facile occasion of their failed marriage, especially both parents lead a well-to-do and respectable life, respectively, severing their consanguineous tie is not something of their ilk's disposition.Anyway, enough of this reviewer's caviling about the set-up, 14-year-old twins Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers (Mills, with the help of Susan Henning as her body double), meet for the first time in the summer camp, after latching onto the fact (in a cabin named Serendipity!), they decide to switch places, Sharon visits California to stay with her father Mitch Evers (Keith), while Susan is hot to trot to meet her mother Maggie McKendrick (O'Hara) in Boston, by impersonating each other.Their tricks work wonderfully to warm the cockle of one's heart, belated union larded with heartfelt embraces and affections, only Mitch's housekeeper Verbena (Merkel, having a ball with her hilarious tight-lipped loquaciousness, but not without astuteness) senses something iffy when Susan's dog refuses to approach Sharon. But time is running out for the twins who are spoiling for getting their parents back together, as Mitch is bewitched by a sultry gold digger Vicky Robinson (Barnes), and soon they will tie the knot. The hurdle is inevitably, stemmed from a man's inanity, it doesn't need a keen eye to discern the motive of Vicky and her mother (Watkins, sporting a perfect hag voice), and truth to be told, a magnificent Maureen O'Hara is simply out of the league of a bungling David Keith (although he has a terrific comic bent to make Mitch somewhat more than tolerable, bar an incredulous pratfall that is too slapdash for Disney's standard).After Susan letting on the whole switch scheme, she and Maggie blow in at Mitch's domicile, and the girls will do anything to sabotage their father's pending wedding, but it is Maggie's guile that does the trick, and the rest is par for the course. But as soon as the girls' appearances are unified (by way of a simple haircut in the camp), their disparate personalities built ebulliently in the first half-hour (Mills proffers a convincing yet very subtle dual personae indeed) also harmonize into a sameness, for shizzle their parents cannot tell them apart, so does the audience, quite a misstep to erase their individuality and the zippy city-versus-ranch upbringing clash at that stage, plus, encouraging playing elaborate-looking pranks might partially and insidiously incubate the heinous bully culture which would have been rampant for decades and then some.In a nutshell, from Richard and Robert Sherman's chirpy titular song accompanied by its dainty opening credits and title cards scenes (two chubby Cupids sharing a kiss steals my heart), to its seamless construction of two Mills in the same frame, THE PARENT TRAP proves to be a delightful confection when Disney is very much in its winsome wheelhouse.",The Parent Trap
16,Rainey-Dawn,A Cute Family Comedy,7,25 June 2014,The story is one that a lot of people can identify with if they come from a divorced family with two loving parents and you want them back together again. Sometimes one or both of your parents will have a new romantic interest that you are not crazy about and want to get rid of them like the character Vicky Robinson (Joanna Barnes). So what are the kids to do? The thing to do is to trap both of your parents - trick them into getting back together! And that is exactly what Susan and Sharon (both played by Hayley Mills) plans to do - Parent Trap! This is a great family comedy film that is fun for all ages.

17,disdressed12,a bit too mellow,5,23 November 2008,"while i will say this movie is certainly family friendly,i didn't really like it all that much.i felt it was too long and slow.i think it could have been 30 minutes shorter without missing anything important.the acting is good,but i found the characters bland and uninteresting.Hayley Mills is is a decent enough actress,and it must be hard for one actor to play twins convincingly,which Mills does.but the movie is a bit too mellow for my tastes.I did like Maureen O'Hara as the mother.she stood out from the rest.Brian Keith was also good as the father.this is definitely a movie the whole family can watch.i did think it was a bit mellow,but to be fair there were a few fun scenes,and some catchy songs.my vote for The Parent trap is a 5/10",The Parent Trap
18,OllieSuave-007,Parents should see this!,9,11 February 2014,"The Parent Trap is, I think, one of the best family films ever made, and one of the best ones from Disney - having that pure, magical Disney touch. This fun story tells about teenage twin girls Sharon and Susan, who met for the first time at summer camp. Concocting a plan, they decide to swap places and try to bring their divorced parents back together.Though is movie is over two hours long, every moment in the film is intriguing and captivating, which captured my attention and I was not left bored at any time during the movie, from the twins concocting plans and course of events to reunite their parents to forest scene where the twins unleash of bag of tricks on the film's antagonist. The acting was great and I especially like the performances of Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara as Mitch and Margaret; they had excellent on-screen chemistry. Hayley Mills did a great job portraying both Sharon and Susan; I enjoyed watching the parts where they first found out they were long lost twins and how they adopted each others personalities when they decided to switch places to visit each other's parents.

The second version is a polished gem, about as slick as it gets, and while the supporting cast is solid, that film is 99% about Lohan and how cute she is. In other words, a star turn.This film is not so clearcut. At first you think it is about Mills (who, typical of the era, never provides any sort of backstory for her clearly Brit accent) but, as the film progresses, you suddenly realize that Mills is merely part of a larger ensemble cast.An ensemble cast that includes Brian Keith (about as stereotyped as a ""dad"" you can find in that era) and Maureen O'Hara.O'Hara, on closer examination, is not merely the ""mother"" in the piece, she is the star. She lights up all her scenes in a way that is obvious only when you consider the scenes she does not appear in.When the film takes a bold run at pure situation comedy (about the halfway point) it is O'Hara that makes that work, too.In short, this is a film which is neither as perfect nor as polished as its successor, but still has an awful lot to offer.Recommended.",The Parent Trap

The whole premise of each parent taking a twin after divorce with no intention of ever meeting again seems preposterous. It is never explained why the twins speak with a British accent when they were born and brought up in the US.

And, I, for one, found it absolutely impossible to believe that when Susan and Sharon were separated shortly after birth that their parents (getting divorced from each other at the time, with each parent taking only one of the girls for themselves) never, ever told that child about the respective twin sister that they had.I mean - Like, c'mon - How frickin' mean, nasty and petty can 2 divorcing parents get? Eh? For the most part The Parent Trap's story (a misguided mix of slapstick and sophistication) just didn't work very well.

I like the dynamic between the two, even if their characters aren't perfect; especially with the sprinkling of domestic violence from O'Hara's Maggie.The plot, which I had heard about beforehand, is certainly interesting.

28,a_chinn,Classic live-action Disney comedy still holds up,8,26 April 2020,"Hayley Mills plays identical twins separated at birth, who discover one another at summer camp and then plot to switch places in a ploy to get their divorced parents back together. The film is corny by todays standards, but it features incredibly warm performances that transcend the dated comedy. Mills is charming in the film's lead as tomboy Susan and prim & proper Sharon, though I think it's the adult performances that really shine, particularly from Maureen O'Hara as the very proper east coast mother and Brian Keith as the rugged western father. Charles Ruggles (""Bringing Up Baby"") is another standout as Sharon's east coast grandfather, as is Una Merkel (""Destry Rides Again"") as Susan's housekeeper/nanny, both of whom see through the girls' deception. Leo G. Carroll (""North by Northwest"") even has a funny small role as a priest who is about to marry Keith to a gold digging bride, which is the primary conflict of the film, the girls having to break up that engagements so dad can remarry mom. Written and directed by David Swift, who's made everything from ""Pollyanna"" to ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" to ""The Hugga Bunch,"" the film is lightweight fluff, but is unpretentiously enjoyable, though I will say the film seemed to feature more cigarettes and hard alcohol than I seem to remember in any other Disney film. But this unpretentious likability factor is a hallmark of most 60s and 70s Disney live-action films, whether it's classics like ""Freaky Friday"" or even lesser films like ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" or ""The North Avenue Irregulars."" The true test of the film's durability was my own children, who were captivated by the film and these are the same children who I've unsuccessfully tried multiple times to watch the original 1976 ""Star Wars"" and who found ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" merely okay. FUN FACT! Look for composer Frank De Vol (who did the music for everything from ""Pillow Talk"" to ""The Dirty Dozen"" to even ""The Brady Bunch"") as the boys choir director at the camp. Also look fast for John Mills, Haley's real-life father, in an uncredited role as a caddy.

30,Kamurai25,Thunderdome: Parent Edition,6,10 July 2020,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend if you've seen any other Parent Trap and not this one.This holds up surprisingly well: Hayley Mills did an excellent job playing both of the girls. I questioned it once, but I honestly thought it was two different people during the movie.That might explain why so much of the movie looked like green screen even though they established it was a real scene by interacting with it. It is also surprising how much 1961 green screen looks like modern 2020 ""true motion"" with a almost fake looking background.Yes, it is quite a gimmick to do a ""twins switch places"", though that's partly because of this movie. It would be one thing if there were just a lot of twin actors looking to make it in the business, but today's climate would claim movies like this were stealing jobs from twins.Though the movie is incredibly dated, it's actually interesting to see that 1950's motif where it was normal to have household staff still. The adults were a bit of a bore, it was the girl(s) fighting or getting along to antagonize the adults that really makes the movie, and that might be the big problem of it all. You have a young teen carrying the movie by doing double work, and the rest of the movie just doesn't feel loved. Sadly it shows the ethics of 1960's Disney.The movie is fun though, and while I doubt anyone is going to watch it over and over again, it is definitely worth a watch, if for nothing else than seeing a birth of a trope.",The Parent Trap
31,bkrauser-81-311064,Sometimes A Divorce Can Be a Good Thing,6,17 April 2012,"No doubt as a penance for releasing scores of animated films without cogent family units, Disney released The Parent Trap; a Hayley Mills starring, anti-divorce film that had to have felt dated on arrival. In it, a set of estranged identical twins meet by sheer happenstance at camp, trade places, and attempt to bring their divorced parents back together again. The plot immediately appealed to me, even though I had seen the Lindsay Lohan remake. It's a story about the difficulties of preserving the family unit, the unfairness of divorce on young children and the implications of love when faced with the practicalities of life. So naturally Disney sidesteps such themes to make a film as fluffy and unnecessary as a feather boa.Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating a little. The young Hayley Mills who had just started her Disney movie blitz is at her best as the likable twins Susan and Sharon. Both characters have personalities that are just developed enough to tell them apart but in case its too subtle one has a bad case of Long Island lockjaw. Their hijinks are fun, their humor agreeable and the end result is one of the more charming performances to come from a child actor.I'm actually quite concerned for these kids who have to deal with such narcissistic parents. Sure Disney glosses over the reasons why they got divorced in the first place but its easy to see their personalities are just too self-absorbed to be loving partners...or parents. If you're the proud parents of twins or triplets or sextuplets, you'd be able to narrow in on who's Justin and Dustin wouldn't you? That puzzle would be even less difficult if one of them had been a stranger to you for thirteen or so years but this all seems to be above their heads. Its only when one of the twins finally blurts out the truth that the families discover there's something rotten in the state of Massachusetts.The parents get even worse when they reunite and start exchanging rancorous chit-chat. The father (Brian Keith) you see is about to marry a much younger gold digger who, of course, exemplifies the evil stepmother trope we've all come to expect. So it only makes sense that the man's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara) takes a trip to the coast, unannounced, totting one of two Machiavellian moppets, making catty comments, and dressing in the man's bathrobe. She then prances around the grounds while he's entertaining in a twisted game of hide-and-seek. Once they actually meet up, they of course argue until she literally punches him in the face in front of their kids! By that point, the couple was one mimosa away from ""Thunderdome"".If either of them were smart they'd get a restraining order against each other and shuttle both kids back and forth between California and Massachusetts. Not an idyllic solution, but its better than living with ""The War of the Roses"" (1988) 24/7. But alas they do stick it out together in the end because everything is supposed to be cheery, rosy and bright. It's a Disney movie after all; there are no tears in Disney movies! I just fear that kids with divorced parents will see this movie and want to imitate it which is kind of sad when you think about it. Its a hard lesson to learn kids, but sometimes a divorced household is better than one where one parent's in the morgue and the other in jail.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",The Parent Trap
32,gftbiloxi,A Classic Charmer,8,8 April 2005,"Although the split-screen technique had been around for a decade or so, it was usually more noted for its failures than its success, and the actor required to play dual roles usually took tremendous heat for their failure to create two physically identical but distinctly different characterizations on screen. But with THE PARENT TRAP, with the difficult dual role resting on the shoulders of an extremely young star, Walt Disney struck gold. It would be the single highest grossing film the studio had released up to that time, and even some forty years later the baby-boomers who flocked to see it in 1961 regard it as one of their favorite movie experiences.But THE PARENT TRAP has a lot more going for it than mere nostalgia. The cast is really, really good, featuring the ever-likable Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in leading roles and a host of great character actors (including Leo G. Carroll and Nancy Kulp) in minor roles. And then there is Haley Mills. The daughter and sister of noted English actors, Mills was no newcomer to the screen when THE PARENT TRAP went before the cameras--she had even picked up an Oscar for her earlier Disney film POLLYANNA. Even so, this was no guarantee that she could pull off the feat of double roles, something that had daunted even the legendary Bette Davis. But she did.The story has been told so often that surely every one knows it by now. A wife delivers twin daughters--but shortly afterward divorces her husband, and each wins custody of one child. The children are raised without any knowledge of each other's existence... until they unexpectedly bump into each other at summer camp, put two and two together, and devise a scheme to get their parents back together again.Even today, and in spite of its familiarity, it's an amusing idea, and while the actual script is weak in spots the cast, and especially Haley Mills, makes the most of it. There's plenty of slapstick, lots of laugh-out-loud scenes, and enough charm to beguile all but the most cynical viewers. And Haley Mills clearly demonstrates why she was regarded as the single most gifted child actor of her era: although she plays both Susan and Sharon with the same edge of mischievous fun, they do indeed come off as completely different personalities.Of course, digital technology has left the old split-screen technique in the dust, and today its easy to see the flaws in the technique that weren't so obvious at the time. And the quality of the film transfer is not the best: while this isn't the worst transfer I've seen, it is full of artifacts nonetheless. Even so, the appeal of the story, the cast, and most particularly Haley Mills make up for a lot, and this Disney double DVD comes complete with a host of bonuses (including a making-of documentary and an audio commentary track by director David Swift and Haley Mills) that fans will enjoy quite a bit.If you were a fan of the film then, you'll remain a fan of it now.

I recently viewed this Disney classic again for the 25th or 30th time a couple of months ago and still found it supremely entertaining. Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are wonderful as the parents and Joanna Barnes makes her presence known as Keith's bitchy new fiancée, Vicky Robinson. Of course, it doesn't make sense that the father lives in California and the mother is from Boston and the twins spoke with English accents, or that nobody noticed, but I let that slide as a kid and I still do.

39,roghache,"Mischievous, lively, & fun twin antics, but a bizarre premise",7,31 March 2006,"I've always been a huge fan of Hayley Mills and grew up with her in this type of movie. Like everyone else, I always just figured it was cute and heartwarming, then got to thinking...and I see at least one other reviewer agrees with me.This Disney family classic tells the story of two twins, Susan and Sharon, whose parents divorced shortly after their birth. Each parent assumed custody of one of their daughters, so these twins have been unaware they have a sister. However, the pair inadvertently meet at summer camp, recognize each other (of course, they're identical), and decide to switch places by going to live for awhile with the opposite parent. Then the scheming but appealing duo embarks upon a mission to reunite their divorced parents, despite the fact that the father is now engaged to another (rather nasty and not at all suitable) woman.First, Hayley Mills is of course an absolutely fabulous little actress here, playing the dual roles of the sisters, Sharon and Susan. She's bubbly, perky, endearing, charming, and all the rest of it, plus makes you believe there really are two different girls. Also, the parents are well cast, with the rugged Brian Keith portraying the father and the beautiful, sophisticated Maureen O'Hara as the mother.However, I agree totally with another reviewer that questions...what kind of strange, cruel, uncaring parents would split up their kids like this? Talk about dividing assets! It seems these twins have essentially no contact or awareness of the non custodial parent, in addition to being quite oblivious that they have a twin sibling. Furthermore, it is incredible that these parents seem to want no contact with their non custodial child. Such a parent does not come across as very heartwarming to me, even if played by Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara! Thus, the basic premise behind this tale is beyond bizarre. Of course the cute antics of the twins get the parents back together in the end. If this estranged couple is so easily reunited, one wonders why they ever divorced in the first place. However, I could forgive this...we all want a happily ever after ending here...but not the splitting up your children in infancy business.Anyway, it's a lively, light hearted, entertaining little movie that's fun to watch, lots of mischievous pranks and so on. But as for a 'family film', it has some strange messages. Parents should discuss some of these issues with their own kids while watching it, whether or not they themselves are in a divorced situation. My own child did not grow up with divorced parents, but I would still have wanted to make it plain...this is Disney and makes a cute story, but dividing up your children like this, denying them knowledge of their sibling or noncustodial parent isn't remotely acceptable in real life.As far as the new 1998 version is concerned, this 1961 Hayley Mills one is a classic and perfectly fine just the way it is.

A great Disney adaptation, as they made them back then. I would highly recommend it to people of all ages, specially if you are a fan of Disney productions or the Lohan version. Even has a musical number! A ""yeah yeah yeah"" song before the Bettles?And for a 60s movie, the effect is almost seamless, as Walt intended. From what I understand, Disney was one of the first to use the ""travelling matte"" process to use the same actress twice on screen.

The ideal missing mother figure turns out to be a ""vixen"" as they say, full of villainess cunning and a will to punch others that impressively enough, the male lead who plays her ex-husband doesn't seem to mind.And rather the two ""cherubic"" twins turn out to be devilish tricksters themselves, really like bullies would be in other films, but the parents don't condemn them for it which is rather refreshing honestly.This is an unusual kind of Disney production, as it's from 1961, because it also has rather strong hints at sexual chemistry between the two previously divorced parents that isn't really seen these days. The lady in a bathrobe, the guy undressing the lady's apron, etc. Subtle but passionate and just not seen in Disney very much.A wholesome film that actually celebrates physicality, as well as sometimes rather strong cunning and tricking that can tiptoe the lie into hazard... such as trick the twins played on the fiancé they didn't like of leaving a trail of honey so bear cubs began to lick it off the sleeping lady in her tent....I liked the film, even though it's a little mature, but hopefully other young people who like to see parents being affectionate with each other will like too.",The Parent Trap

Mills doesn't make the twins distinctive though the special effects are fine and unobtrusive. The big problem with the film is that the adults are childish and unappealing and Keith and O' Hara don't belong together and what brought them together in the first place remains a mystery.

She plays twins separated at birth who meet and camp and decide to switch places and meet the parent they've never seen, and try to get mom (Maureen O'Hara) and dad (Brian Keith) back together. The result is a film that is very entertaining, funny, and touching. There are tons of memorable scenes, such as the girls meeting, the song and dance (""Let's Get Together"") scene, and the camping trip. The 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan is even better and more touching, as this plot works even better for a family film today, in my opinion. However, this original is very funny and definitely worth watching. If you've only seen the remake, this version may seem dated at first.

Year later I saw 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan as the dad of a young daughter this time I saw it from a different perspective.

Firstly, before I start ranting on how great the film was, I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed.The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to con-cock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again, trying to reunite their parents.The acting, scenery and settings, music score, unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards.My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece, but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion.I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments (especially the woods scenes). However, I did find the music a little bit too typical (very 50's-60's styled themed music, it sounded like anything else).Overall, I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it, but there's just something about the remake which I found more special, but then again if we didn't have this film, we wouldn't have the remake!!!

48,clydestuff,A double dose of Hayley Mills in an exceptional Disney gem,10,16 July 2003,"***plot synopsis in this review***Once upon a time, before there were Barefoot Executives, Computers Wearing Tennis Shoes, Strongest Men In The World, World's Greatest Athletes,  and Invisible College Students, there was a studio named Disney that believed in making good  live action family motion pictures.  They made gems like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Old Yeller, Pollyanna, Mary Poppins and this little gem called The Parent Trap.Not only do we get Hayley Mills playing dual roles with perfection, we get a great script by David Swift (who also wrote the script for Pollyanna and directed both films) that draws us in right from the opening credits (despite a somewhat obnoxious theme song vocalized by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello).  Add to this one of the best supporting casts Walt could possibly have assembled, and you have two hours plus of rollicking entertainment.When Hayley is on the screen with herself, the effect is uncanny, and you almost believe there are two Haley Mills.  These scenes are mixed with others where she interacts with a double, (the uncredited Susan Henning) and the combination works,  due in large part to Ub Iwerks who came up with the special photgraphic effects to make it all possible.  Remember, in 1961 there was no such thing as digital effects so this was a tremendous undertaking for it's time, not having been done to this extent before.You should know the story by now but briefly, it centers around two girls, Sharon and Susan, who end up in the same summer camp and discover that they are identical twins who were separated from each other when their parents divorced, each parent taking custody of one of the twin girls.  The rest of the movie centers on them changing identities, not only to meet the other parent, but in a wild scheme to get the parents (played by Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith) back together again.  Okay, so it is all far-fetched but it is far-fetched hilarity.Besides Hayley's performance, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are great also, with Brian Keith never being funnier as the father who always seems to be getting the worst part of everything.  Add to this a possible future step-monster played by Joanna Barnes, and Leo G. Carroll in a small but unforgettable role as a preacher, how could you go wrong?  Even if you don't like this type of film, it's worth a look to see it at least once in your life.This movie was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, and Natassia Richardson.  The update is equally fun, which just goes to show what a good idea they had in the first place.If I have a complaint it's not with the movie but with the Disney Studios. This is one of their films that was given first class treatment on DVD, one of the best I have purchased.  What makes this so maddening is that they can release a great DVD like this one minute, then rush out bad DVD transfers on fine films like Moonspinners and The Journey of Natty Gann.  I'm not asking that they release every film in a special two disc edition, but there is absolutely no excuse why they can't at least make a decent video transfer of some of their other films.  Just getting a decent copy of the films would be enough.  It's frustrating.Till Next Time, Next Class Please",The Parent Trap

Maureen O'Hara was into her forties here and puts her youthful competition in the shade in the sexy department.The one sad thing about this film is that thousands of divorced kids became fixated on the plot, on the idea of reuniting their parents. Luci Arnaz and Desi Jr. watched this a dozen times, dreaming of bringing Lucy and Desi back together (they had been recently divorced). Lucy finally blew up. ""NO MORE PARENT TRAP.

Her every line, gesture and expression was perfect.

51,estabansmythe,This will take you back,7,20 February 2006,"You already know this: this is great family fun. Get the gang together, throw a couple bags of popcorn in the wave, sit back and have a good time.The Big Surprise of ""The Parent Trap"" (1961) is that Maureen O'Hara is can be pretty unlikable through most of the picture. She's pretty much the same hellaciously feisty and fighting Irish witch that married John Wayne in ""The Quiet Man"" and who often only argued and fought with the poor guy.However, when she has her sane, loving moments with ex-hubby Brian Kieth, she lights up the screen and ""The Parent Trap"" blossoms.Bu of course, the film belongs to delightful little Haley Mills, who didn't stir any romantic feelings in me until three years later in Disney's ""The Moon Spinners"" which was her first romantic adolescent role when she fell for dashing young adventurer Peter McHenry and visa versa.In ""The Parent Trap,"" Haley pulls of the minor miracle of playing to herself (delightfully) as twin sisters separated at age one, with each of them going to one divorced parent. IMPORTANT FUN NOTE: Of course, the fact that Haley's totally British accent is undisguised in two girls who have lived all their lives in the US (one in California, the other back east) is to be blissfully ignored.Vets Una Merkel, Charlie Ruggles, Nancy Kulp, the always wonderful Ruth McDevitt, loopy composer/band leader Frank ""Happy Kyne"" DeVol and Leo G. Carroll add a special zing to the festivities.And the knockout Joanna Barnes is a particularly nasty Harpy who manages to get herself engaged to Keith, much to the dire consternation of the twin Haley's and O'Hara.

53,michellelocke007,still doesn't beat the original 1961 version *possible spoilers*,8,12 September 2010,one of Disney's all time favourite classics and beloved by many of all different ages. Hayley mills who quickly rose to stardom and recognition for her superb choice of roles shined in this family dramedy after twin sisters separated at birth after their parents divorce who took one girl each at birth. they would meet years later as teens at a summer camp not knowing the other existed. what ensues is hilarity at every corner and classic slapstick and physical comedy. mills is the perfect choice for the role as if she were born to play it and the added touch is her fun song performance mid-way through the film. i thought the film was perfectly cast and there was just great chemistry between all the actors. it's also nice to see that Maggie was portrayed as a fiercely independent and fiery individual who didn't take nonsense from anyone and stood up for herself. the script was expertly written without the story being overly sappy or melodramatic. plus there weren't any points where it dragged for too long or bored the audience. i didn't much care for the sequels that followed which also starred Hayley mills but as and adult. i recently saw the remake starring Lindsay lohan and it doesn't do it justice. you can't beat the original as it's always the first one you see.,The Parent Trap
54,chrisbishop5000,A Strictly Laugh Affair indeed! 123 Minutes of unfailing fun and merriment that certainly had ME laughing!,10,7 June 2007,"About five hours and forty minutes ago from this moment, I finished watching ""The Parent Trap"" with my mother downstairs after just over two hours of playing time and we were extremely amused - to say the least! I feel so glad for recording the film on ITV1 just last Christmas or else I'd have missed out. Believe me now, if YOU haven't ever watched it you'd be missing out too. I have not seen the 1998-remake and my mum keeps telling me and telling me and telling me that she recommends that I see that film too and after an extent this irritates me and how can I if I can't find the video it was recorded on? I know she's only trying to help though and I am moved by her efforts.She does tell me that unlike most tatty, tired remakes that one is just as good if not BETTER than this original presentation of a novel which appears to be French. Neither of us could wait to watch the movie this afternoon and, after my stressful morning at college and mum's own stress from keeping everything in order with her poor bad back, it certainly lightened our hearts.To think that the technology even existed back then in the early 1960s to use such special camera effects that give the illusion of not only one but a pair of Hayley Mills for the purpose of bringing the twins and their plan that was simply fate to life.Some minutes after the overture, at the dance party at Camp Inch, that huge - and I mean HUGE - fight between the twin sisters at the dance, I think, was destined to show its audience just how rebellious, secretive and malicious those girls can be; after all, it's not everyday on such a special occasion as a dance party at a Summer Camp is ruined by merely two girls who are so angry with one another that they start up an enormous catfight, knocking stalls over, breaking record players, getting food absolutely everywhere and causing one heck of a mob and even getting the headmistress involved! My god, most kids I know wouldn't dare, they'd feel much too threatened! But I still think that all of that just adds to the comedy of it all; that shocking kind of behaviour, the malice of those two young girls triumphing over the discipline of any adult - strict or slushy alike - just adds to all the unstopping entertainment! But I completely agree with my amazing mum when she says it's sad for Vicky, Mitch's wife-to-be, being treated with such disrespect! It is not in the least bit fair for her and, answer this, is it HER fault that Margaret Evers changed back to Margaret McKendrick because Mitch divorced her? The answer is obvious.I imagine Disney wanted to make Vicky mean, bullying and selfish and she is all those - though to an extent - because for the most part, the reason she had such a bad temper was simply due to the fact that she'd reached the end of her tether with those kids and so from the point of the camping holiday, both I and my mother sympathize the long-suffering future bride completely and it's kinda sad how she forced herself to leave the man she loved because of the behaviour of his two girls. Even when she threw a tantrum just like the twin sisters in throwing pots and pans all over the place and hit the pair of them on her way out, we sympathize her and can't really blame her either.Still, we also kinda thought, ""they're thinking, 'it was certainly worth that slap to get her out'"" and, to tell the truth, I couldn't think of a much better ending; Vicky to a degree got exactly what she deserved because she was not the nicest person in the world but they still felt bad about tormenting her, made that known to their parents & life turned out to be just as they originally planned. I, myself, have experienced the trauma of my parents divorcing one another at the minor age of 6 and I couldn't believe my dad was going to spend a most of every year yet to come abroad, away from his family and I know MY biological parents will not remarry ever again but I couldn't think of a better husband for my wonderful mother than the one she has now and the message to this comparison is that all families are different.At the end, one of the girls wakes up early in the morning and tells the other of a dream she just had... the second wedding of Mitch Evers and Margaret McKendrick in the garden of their house, all their friends and relatives attended and the twin sisters who are bridesmaids grin at each other as if to say, ""we've done it! Our plans finally worked!"" I highly recommend this outrageous, fun-filled, spirited two hours for those who feel they need a nice vacation from the contemporary action thrillers and horrors e.t.c and I think you may well find that the somewhat ""sad"" moments are not really sad at all - just endearing and sentimental that's all. The fun here is unfailing, take it from me!",The Parent Trap
55,babeth_jr,A movie that is close to my heart...,9,22 November 2009,"As an identical twin who was born the year this film came out, it for obvious reasons holds a special place in my heart. I remember watching it on TV as a little girl with my identical twin sister and we loved every minute of it! We could obviously relate to the incredibly close (yet at times frustrating) bond shared by Sharon and Susan, played by the delightful Hayley Mills. I don't think that you have to be a twin to have fun with this movie. It is a delight on all levels.Maureen O'Hara (at the height of her great beauty in this film) and the ruggedly handsome Brian Keith are perfectly cast in their roles as the twins divorced parents. A great cast of supporting players that include Charles Ruggles, Una Merkel, Joanna Barnes and Leo G. Carroll just add to the talent that went into making this picture. They just don't make movies like this anymore, family movies that are great for everyone to watch without being overly sappy or dull. It makes me long for the good old days.For a fun family movie night don't waste your time on the remake with Lindsey Lohan.

Their parents are divorced and they had decided to take custody of one girl each. They guess that since neither of their parents has remarried, they must still harbor feelings for each other. They each go to the other parent and plot to bring their parents together again. It is a simple story. The first half of the movie in very enjoyable. The scenes where the girls see their other parent for the first time are touching. But, the movie looses touch after the parents meet; it becomes noisy and meandering. There is an unnecessary plot-line of the father's (Brian Keith) engagement to a generic, gold-digging, young woman and the girls trying to get rid of her. Maureen O'Hara, as the mother, easily steals the show with her wit, grace and beauty. There are many good, well-acted supporting characters like the girls maternal grandparents, the sharp nanny and the flirty Reverend. The girls' personalities are well-written. The father gets the tomboy and the mother gets the more feminine daughter. But, Hayley Mills rather fails to bring the differences to life. She gives the same performance for both the characters but somewhat makes it up with her liveliness. It has good nostalgic value but does not really stand up if you are watching for the first time in 2010's.",The Parent Trap

There is nothing special, but it is from an era that is simple and not as flashy or bloated as most movies in the present.
The plot is straightforward they meet the switch places and then they bring their parents together.
The dad's girlfriend Vicky serves as drama and as a point it make the story more complex. More importantly it opened the door for a lot of the movie's comedy.
Halley Mills has a great performance and unless you are looking for it she looks like two separate people, I think it is a great accomplishment for 1961.
Obviously the setup is an obvious plot convenience, but that is almost part of its charm, it is silly.
It touches on the unfairness of children who live in a broken home. Divorce sucks.",The Parent Trap
59,kennethtownsend-97230,Great movie!,9,14 October 2015,"The movie The Parent Trap starts off with your main characters Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick. You first meet the two girls at a summer camp. From the most they set eyes on each other they hate each other, it might have been because they look so much alike. After pulling several pranks on each other the girls end up stuck in a cabin together! One stormy day they start to talk to each other and find out that Sharon only has a Mom and Susan only has a Dad! They put it together that they are twin sisters! They decide to switch lives so they can meet there other parent. They then try and pull there parents back together.The Parent Trap was a very family friendly movie. There were several times to laugh during the movie, but it definitely had a deeper meaning. This is definitely a movie to watch with the whole family. It was a very interesting story, that kept you not wanting to see it end. It is nice to know that they are bringing their family back together. It really shows the importance of having families together helping each other. I would definitely give this movie a good rating.",The Parent Trap

So much for the ""trap"", the ""parent"" part though, is pretty horrible. Their dad seems to be the worst dad on earth, probably the worst man too. How can any man not fall in love with MAUREEN O HARA the first time he sees her(after 13 years)?? She has to actually get out of her way to trick them to break their engagement?? And for a man who abandoned her and separated her from her child years ago (I assumed), let her kid be slapped by a stranger and did nothing about it, not to mention he's barely handsome and has no personality what so ever at all. That's just ridiculous. She should have been still mad at him, and he had too crawl on his knees to win her back. Actually she and the kids deserve better.",The Parent Trap
61,avi-greene2,This version of The Parent Trap is far superior to the remake.,9,3 June 2016,"I first heard of this movie when I was a very little kid and I grew up with a Disney Sing Along video that contained a song from it called ""Let's Get Together"", so when I was eight years old I was motivated to try out the full movie and my family and I rented the movie from our library. That was my first time watching it from start to finish, and ever since then I also rented it from my library again in 4th grade and on Netflix in 9th grade. From the moment I watched this comedy in 9th grade, I've always though to myself ""Wow, what a great film this is!"", and to this day I own the movie on DVD and there are many things I love about it. First off, I love the beautiful scenery of Camp Inch where the twins in the movie meet in the beginning, as well as Sharon McKendrick's beautiful mansion in Boston and Susan Evers' Spanish architecture house in Monterrey, California. What I thought of the acting was that Hayley Mills definitely aced playing the roles of the twins (whose names I mentioned earlier in my review), as well as the beautiful Hollywood actress Maureen O'Hara playing the role of Maggie McKendrick twenty years after her most acclaimed role, Angharad Morgan in the hit John Ford film ""How Green Was My Valley"". In my opinion, Mills played the role of the twins much better than Lindsay Lohan did in the new version of The Parent Trap. In addition to all the phenomenal filming and acting of this hit movie, I also love the music that the Sherman Brothers wrote like the pretty song ""For Now For Always"", and ""Let's Get Together"" (of course). If anyone is looking for a funny film to watch that combines phenomenal acting and engaging music, I recommend you check out this movie and definitely skip the remake of it with Lindsay Lohan.",The Parent Trap
62,Darryl-Gonzalez,"A PERFECT family film, well worth 2 hours!",10,17 January 2006,"This film is excellent! It's the story of two twins who were separated shortly after birth when their parents divorce. The twins (both played masterfully by Hayley Mills) accidentally meet up at summer camp 11 years or so later (each not knowing of the other's existence), and through a series of hilarious hijinks, realize that they are sisters and plot to get Mom and Dad back together again. This is a movie that reminds us that marriages, even bad ones, are worth working out and fighting for, a message that is missing in so many Hollywood movies these days. Look for really charming, Oscar-worthy (in my opinion) performances by Una Merkel (Verbeena) and Charles Ruggles (Charles McKendrick). ****SPOILER ALERT**** The scene where the twins first realize who they are and what happened is classic, and worth the price of a rental by itself. The dance number, ""Let's Get Together"", which the twins perform again later in the movie, is memorable, and you'll be singing it to yourself for weeks later! So, if you want to make a ninny out of yourself by not seeing this movie, it's none of my never mind, that's why I'm not saying a word!10/10 stars.",The Parent Trap
63,summer1111dg,Family fun,10,6 December 2006,"The Parent Trap, with Hayley Mills is one of the best movies Disney ever made. It has held up through time b/c it is a classically themed movie.Hayley Mills is a very talented child actress who more than holds her own in this movie. Despite being made in 1961, the magic of making Hayley a ""twin"" holds up well. I think that the first half of the movie, where the twins are at camp is way too long. It could have been cut by two thirds. It drags on for so long and all the viewer awaits is for when they switch places.Finally the switch takes place and the fun begins. I love Charles Ruggles as the grandfather! But the movie would have been far better without the awful grandmother character.Maureen O'Hara as Margaret McKendrick is perfect casting. A fiery, Boston beauty and she is more than a match for Mitch.Brian Keith, as Mitch Evers is great casting too. He is wonderful as the rugged, no nonsense father.

What neat things will I find in my stocking as I sneak downstairs to look in it? What will be in the next present that I open? Will I or won't I glimpse Santa sneaking around my living room? The greatest surprise of all is realizing that the little babe born in the manger is really the creator of the cosmos and of the very manger he is sleeping in.The Parent Trap is like Christmas. It brings smiles, joys and surprises. Imagine going away to summer camp when you discover someone who looks exactly like you standing in the lunch line. Who are they? And why do they have your face? You mean we have the same birthday? You mean we have the same parents? WERE SIBLINGS!!! What would you do in a situation like this? Why switch places with your newly discovered sibling of course.This film has as much intrigue as a James Bond film and as much mystery as an Agatha Christie novel, as the twins plot to get their divorced parents back together. It's great to have a film so blatantly say 'Divorce Really Sucks (the life out of families) And the Sixth Sense style surprises continue to show up throughout the film as the parents and those in the households on each side of the continent realize that the person they thought was one twin really was the other one.Sometimes when the revelation is revealed in a story, the interest level seems to flatten in the storyline, but not in this film. It maintains a high level of interest throughout the film. It's also interesting to note that in that the high quality special effects that were used in the picture were done in an age before computers were as sophisticated as they are today. It is really convincing that there are two Hayley Mills on the screen at the same time. I once did shot the same person on tape using two different hair styles and made it look like she was talking to herself as a different person. It's way cool to do if you know how to do that sort of thing. I also shot myself doing the 'Who's on First' routine.The movie has few flaws if any. At times I had trouble telling the two characters apart but that may be me and is not enough to mention as a real flaw. Some of the characters smoke cigarettes in plain view of children. I mean the horror of it. Overall I think cigarettes stink and are bad for children but I am not a smoking Nazi who would sponge all cigarettes from older films. There are some who would actually do this.Another neat little thing is how they talk about sexuality without actually talking about it. The innocence of a family friendly film is still intact with the reality of the meaning of sexuality and martial love weaved into the seams of the film. All of the actors are a delight to spend two hours with especially Hayley and the guy who played the minister. You also get to witness Hayley kicking the crap out of herself. It's rare you see a good girl fight on film. It's sexist that only men kick the crap out of each other and never women.Part of the reason I loved this film as much as I did in my reviewing of it, is because I was impressed and pleased that Disney could produce such a high quality, mature looking film. This film is not just good for Disney, its' a good film in general. Any Disney slapstick happens as a result of the story and not as a result to just get laughs.This is not worth a rental, it's worth buying and keeping and sharing with loved ones. Rent it by all means if you don't have the money to buy it. This film is Pure Movie Magic. Disney Gold: A warning: Don't be tempted to watch the sequel that is on the same DVD disc, it's bad as the original is good. If the original is Charismas, the sequel is Tax Day eve.",The Parent Trap

My response was along the lines of ""What a stupid, silly, comedy; I'm not going to go see that movie"".  Soon thereafter, my parents and I visited for a week with relatives in another city.  One day they took us to see; you guessed it; ""The Parent Trap"".  Fortunately, I was open-minded enough to pay attention to it.  I discovered that, instead of stupid and silly, the comedy was clever, original, and most of all, very funny.  And, of course, I fell in love with Hayley Mills.  She was so much more spunky and feisty than any girl I knew.  I loved that line ""We submarined her"".  Then there was that darling face with, still to this day, the cutest nose I have ever seen.I've had the video for years and watch it fairly often.

However....,5,5 December 2010,"When people watch The Parent Trap, I wonder if they ever notice, like I have, a certain undercurrent of cruelty that even got past Walt Disney's watchful eye.If you didn't catch it, let me point it out: Mitch and Maggie Evers get divorced and decide to let an entire continent separate them. This is realistic so far. But their breakup is obviously so hostile and nasty that one takes Sharon, the other takes Susan, and mutually decide that neither twin shall ever know of their other sibling's existence.This is bad enough on its own. But to add icing to this inedible cake, Mitch and Maggie choose to forget about their other child at the other end of the country. Why inflict this on their girls? They didn't ask to be born, let alone cause the split.Okay, okay, I tend to look a little too close at this stuff today than when I was younger. After all, that is the plot, right? And the twins resolve this parental problem, right? And Disney would never end any movie on a sad note, right? Despite my observation, I enjoyed the rest of the movie.

There is something about classic Disney movies that will never be done again, as they have their own uniqueness to them. David Swift did an excellent job with the script and direction. This is just an all around, cute, interesting and enjoyable movie. Hayley Mills was just awesome as was the rest of the cast. One flaw, though, is the English accent Hayley falls in and out of, but it's such a minor flaw that most people would either not notice or not care. It would have helped for Sharon to be from London (like the remake) instead of Boston. This film also displays beautiful homes and scenery. You can't help but truly care about the outcome of this film, even if it is a little predictable. I recommend this classic film, if family movies are your thing.",The Parent Trap
70,Wig-2,One of my favorites,8,15 December 1999,"This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood.  I loved watching the antics of the twins played by Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills, but you have to overlook a few issues and just enjoy the show.  Typical of many Disney movies in the 50's and 60's, there are two separate plots. (So it could be turned into two TV episodes!) The first is a story about how separated twins meet at summer camp and switch places.  The second story tells how they submarine their father's engagement and get their parents back together again.  One of the most interesting things about the first part is the contrast between the proper Bostonian and the free spirit Californian and how they deal with their new, unfamiliar surroundings after they've switched places.  (The scene where Sharon plays a classical piano piece, switching quickly to chopsticks when her father finally notices that she's never been able to play before, is too, too funny, but unfortunately was usually cut out in versions that had to fit into 2 TV hours.) That contrast disappears in the second part, however, and each twin acts like the other, even when they're not trying to fool their parents. (I would have expected Sharon to have screamed at the lizard sitting on the canteen.)I had always been puzzled why Mitch (Brian Keith) ever would have left Maggie (Maureen O'Hara) in the first place. And then, why would he ever be interested in snooty Vicky (Joanna Barnes)...and why he wouldn't have IMMEDIATELY dumped her for Maggie.But beyond these few puzzlers, it's a joy to watch.  And oh yes, Ruth McDevitt is a hoot!",The Parent Trap
71,sjdean,100% Perfect,7,26 March 2000,"Wow. I cant get enough of this film. Im not going to compare it with the 1998 version, because even though they have the same name and same basic plot, they are two different styles so how people can say one is better than the other is beyond me. But, the 1961 version IS better.
It has everything, comedy, romance, sadness, the acting is superb, not just from Hayley Mills, but you have Brian Keith as Mitch, and Rev. Mosby, 'Bourbon, Double, On the rocks'. I cannot fault this film and cant wait to watch it again.One of the best films ever made.",The Parent Trap
72,aashdon,A Favorite During My Tween Years,7,6 March 2011,"I first saw this movie on Sunday night TV Wonderful World of Disney in 1979 and was hooked. I bought the book at the school book fair and reread it a dozen times.My older sister had seen Parent Trap in the theater and knew all of the parts that 1970s TV had edited out.In the 1980s I finally got to see the whole film uncut on the Disney cable channel and finally got to figure out ""the little dolls signing the parent trap song"" my sister spoke of (there was 15 minutes I'd never get back)....Dorky animated cupids aside, as a kid I loved the movie's cross country saga. The camp cabin sabotage, the twins joining forces to prank dad's girlfriend.Although most kids will still enjoy the original movie's favorite kid moments of the punchbowl splashing into a chaperon, the timeless cake falling on Miss Inch's face, and Vicky's hissy fit, the movie's long pace might bore todays kids.Although some purists don't like the new remake of Parent Trap, I thought the remake kept the essence of the original story and updated it to match todays global travel, destigmatization of divorce, etc.",The Parent Trap
73,spletinckx,An endearing comedy with two enchanting Hayley Mills,8,26 December 2005,"The Parent Trap is a wonderful Walt Disney comedy. It allows us to benefit (in part thanks to the then revolutionary ""split screen"" technique) from a great performance by two Hayley Mills instead of one! The story of twin sisters discovering each other at a summer camp and trying to rebuild their ""broken home"" is very endearing. Yet, the emotion is well balanced with refreshing humor and quid pro quo situations. The cast is superb and it is worth mentioning the magnificent acting by the ever beautiful Maureen O'Hara and masculine Brian Keith. There is also a great appearance by Hitchcockien Leo G. Carroll in the role of a really funny Reverend. Still, center stage is Hayley Mills, 15 years old when the film was released, always funny, witty and really enchanting. Eventually, looking back at it now, The Parent Trap also, in my opinion, send us a feeling of nostalgia, like a frozen time capsule of the early 1960's.",The Parent Trap
74,Steve-193,EXCELLENT family movie. Fun and light-hearted.,10,28 September 1998,The Parent Trap is one of those ageless family movies. It is light-hearted and filled with down-to-earth humor. Without a doubt you will see this listed as one of those Disney classics.This is a must see for the whole family but especially for those children with the vivid imagination.Steve Kaden,The Parent Trap
75,allisondye,A classic fairytale,8,9 September 2021,"I've admire Hayley Mills ever since I first saw her in a Disney movie as a little girl. She delights me with her personality and style. This movie is an absolute classic in my opinion. And it's still technically impressive. Hayley Mills plays two people and yet no one would ever guess. The scenes in which she is in the same room with herself are seamlessly done even by today's standards.I said this is a classic but it's a fairy tale. I know personally a family with 5 children who loved the concept of getting their parents back together. They came away with hope in their eyes that this could one day happen for them. But it's often as realistic as hoping that they'll one day meet 7 dwarves in a house in the woods. Once you see a child look at you asking if it can ever be true for them, it makes the movie a little bittersweet.",The Parent Trap
76,blancd,One of my all time favorites!!!,10,19 September 2004,"I love the movie, always have. But then, why wouldn't I? Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, and Hayley Mills? Excellent cast. My parents took me to see this movie when I was a kid -- [I was born in 1955] so I wasn't too old and I totally loved it. I own the VHS and will probably have to buy the DVD, if I can find it.Joanna Barnes is the woman you love to hate -- god wasn't she just wicked and terrible in this movie? You just hate her!!! Calling Hayley - pet, in that exaggerated way. UGH! Brian Keith, god I just loved this man! Loved him in Family Affair too! Always such a good actor. [Some other favorites; Those Calloways, The Pleasure Seekers, Nevada Smith, and especially, With Six you get Eggroll.] Maureen O'Hara, what a wonderful actress. I loved her in this movie, but then love her in any and everything she's done really [some other favorites are; McLintock! and Spencer's Mountain].Cute, cute movie.",The Parent Trap
77,silvermander,Wonderful!!!,9,12 May 2007,"I re-watched The Parent Trap last weekend (watching Polyanna right now) and got to remember just how wonderful Disney movies were in the 50's and 60's. I know movie making and styles have changed, but our kids need to see the wonderful old movies full of love, caring, fun, humor and respect. They are great movies.The Parent Trap is heart warming and so revolutionary in its time of making. The split screen was so new but beautifully done. I like that they only used Lohan in the remake (holding true to the original) - which I think is quite well done, but it's not as good as the original.This is a great movie that should be revived and shown to kids - along with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Polyanna, etc. It shows a lost time in movie making. Even Disney doesn't make movies like this anymore, which is a shame.Watch this wonderful movie and watch it with your kids, you will all appreciate it as we did.",The Parent Trap
78,JenBluffheid,Spectacular!!!,9,18 June 2002,"This movie is one of the best sixties one out there. It is much better than the 1998 version. Haley Mills plays both characters to perfection (as always), and it has a great plot with unexpected twists and turns. You really should see this!!!~Jen",The Parent Trap
79,tony_morrow,A must watch!,10,6 June 2020,"Childhood classic, reeks of nostalgia. The effects for the doppelganger was way ahead of its time, considering it's 60years old.",The Parent Trap
80,ramick-1,"""A Superb Gem""",10,7 April 2007,"David Swift's directing must be the magic of the original (1961) ""The Parent Trap"", because both the 1961 and 1998 movies had excellent casts with for the most part the same story line, but the original is far far better than the 1998 version. Although I enjoy watching the 1998 version for what it is, I become totally absorbed into the original 1961 production for it seems effortlessly natural and realistic where as the 1998 production seems totally contrived. I cannot even give the 1998 version a pass for being contrived as a parody of the original. Naturally the styles from 1961 look a bit dated today but the entire original film is a superb gem. I hope you equally enjoy it should you have the opportunity to view the original 1961 production of Walt Disney's ""The Parent Trap"".",The Parent Trap
81,catislndr2001,A Classic among Classics,10,18 July 2006,"This touching classic is my favorite movie of all time. My parents divorced when I was very young and I had a sister less than a year older than myself. My biological mother was Irish and from the Cape Cod area of Mass, also my father moved to California as in the film. The movie is flawless in its depiction of a child's desire to get the family back together with the affection and belonging that ensues. Haley Mills, the ""other"" twin (I believe her name was Susan), Bryan Keith, Maureen Ohara, Leo G. Carroll as well as all the rest could not have done a better or more convincing job. I hold a very sentimental place for this remarkable film.",The Parent Trap
82,eeyore329,One great movie!!!,10,22 May 2008,"I love this movie.......have watched it a million times....have it on DVD and VHS......can practically quote the whole movie.......I remember the first time I watched it, while it was coming on I thought ""this is going to be boring""....boy was I wrong.......loved it!! ""Im so mad I could just spit"" is a common phrase here...its fun to quote the movie. The girls always doing something to make you laugh......a great family movie. These don't come around that much anymore. I always wanted to go to camp and meet my twin.....my mom says there is not one.......just seems like something fun to do.....a whole summer at camp.........my daughter is a girl scout, and she goes to day camp in the summer. I always joke with her about coming home as her twin. ""she doesn't have one either"" my kids like the newer parent trap movie, but this one is the best.",The Parent Trap
83,esr1,Why Remake it,10,1 December 2002,The 1961 parent trap is 10 times better than the 1998 version Hayley Mills is the better actress. The 1998 Film reeked and they changed the whole plot by adding in their own parts and destroying the dress scene in the 1961 version which explains how they get sent to the isolation cabin. There is no way Lindsay Lohan can even try to compare with Hayley Mills performance,The Parent Trap
84,dama_arwen76,Emotion sou,10,26 October 2018,"This is one of my favourite movie, ever!
It makes me fell as when I was a child and sow it for the first time. This film has something special, in a different and deeper way from lots of ""family movie"".
It's a cult that everyone must see.",The Parent Trap

86,kadeeq,Is this real true love?,6,7 December 2015,"Vicki exclaims, ""Are you inferring that I'd marry your father for his money?"" ""If the shoe fits, wear it,"" responds Sharon.The Parent Trap, filmed in 1961, is about twin girls that meet each other at a summer camp. The girls do not get along because they look like each other (as weird as that sounds) and get in trouble because of the games and pranks that cause mischief. The girls get sent into the same cabin as punishment. They have to learn how to work together for the rest of the summer camp. One day Susan and Sharon decide to converse with each other. They share information about where they are from, and things they like to do. Sharon shares that she lives with her mom, and Susan shares that she lives alone with her dad. After a few more comparisons, they realize that they are long lost twins. Sharon and Susan use the rest of the summer camp to get to know each other and their families. Sharon cuts her hair the same as Susan because they decide to switch places. Sharon takes Susan's place at home, and Susan takes Sharon's place. Sharon meets her father, Mitch, for the first time and comes to realize that her father is in love with another young lady named Vicki. Vicki wants to marry the twins' father because of his wealth. Sharon calls Susan and begs her to bring their mother to California so she can stop the wedding. Susan and her mother fly out to California so they can get this confusion resolved. Sharon and Susan plan to destroy their father's wedding plans. Sharon and Susan set up romantic dinners for their mother and father. Sharon and Susan's mother, Maggie, meets Vicki, she does her best to embarrass Mitch. Maggie does not want Mitch to get married to Vicki because she secretly still loves Mitch. Sharon and Susan do everything they can to stop all wedding plans with Mitch and Vicki. The family plans a camping trip and Vicki throws a fit. Vicki does not want Maggie to come because she is the 'ex-wife'. Sharon and Susan are disappointed when they found out that their mother will not be coming on the camping trip. They plan to prank Vicki on the camping trip because they know how much Vicki does not enjoy the outdoors. Vicki did not enjoy the camping trip with Mitch and the girls because of the pranks Sharon and Susan pull. Sharon and Susan had lots of practice at summer camp, so they were pros at pranking Vicki, and getting her to not like the girls. Sharon and Susan gained up on Vicki to make her leave. Vicki called off the wedding because she was fed up with the girls. Mitch, of course, picked his girls over Vicki. Maggie was secretly overjoyed with this news when they came home from camping. Mitch and Maggie end up falling in love for the second time. Sharon and Susan could finally live together without switching places.The climax of the movie is when Susan and Sharon find out that Mitch is wanting to get remarried to Vicki. The movie now has a problem, and it's now the screenwriter's job to come up with a solution. The girls tell their mother, Maggie, and she is not thrilled about the news. The screenwriter uses Maggie to notice the problem and fix it. Maggie drops little hints in the movie to show that she is still interested in Mitch. Does Mitch recognize those hints?Mitch does not recognize that Maggie still loves him. Mitch has to figure out if Vicki is the right person to marry, or if he truly loves Maggie. It was made clearly that Maggie has already made up her mind, and goes to visit Mitch to win his heart back. Susan and Sharon have decided that once they get their parents back together, they can live together and not have to travel to see each other. Susan and Sharon think that this is the answer to the problem. The twins don't know that getting back together after a divorce is not an easy thing. Mitch and Maggie would have to work out all sorts of problems to get it to work, and what if they don't really love each other? Susan and Sharon were very lucky because it works out for them.",The Parent Trap
