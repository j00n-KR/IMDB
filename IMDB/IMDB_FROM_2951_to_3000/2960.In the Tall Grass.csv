0,Leofwine_draca,Too little substance,4,6 October 2019,"I had some hopes for IN THE TALL GRASS, the latest Stephen King adaptation made by Netflix, when I saw that the director was Vincenzo Natali, of CUBE fame. I like CUBE a lot and feel that it holds up even today, but this new single-location film is singularly lacking. There simply isn't enough plot to last the running time, so a lot of this is made up of repetitive scenes of characters running around calling for each other. As for the scares, well they're typical haunted house-style jumpy moments so little of interest there. On the plus side, Patrick Wilson gives another entertaining performance, and the cinematography isn't bad, but there's far too little of substance for this to be of much interest.",In the Tall Grass
1,claudio_carvalho,The Intriguing Supernatural Field,6,11 October 2019,"While traveling to San Diego, Cal DeMuth (Avery Whitted) stops the car nearby a tall grass field since his pregnant sister Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) is sick and need to vomit. They overhear the cry for help from a young boy and decide to look for the boy in the field. Soon they realize the field is a supernatural place that manipulates time and space and there is no way out from the tall grass.""In the Tall Grass"" is an intriguing supernatural horror movie with a story based on a novel of Stephen King that recalls a creepy episode of The Twilight Zone. The conclusion is open to interpretation but if the boy succeeds to stop Cal and Becky, Travis will probably never look for them and consequently would be also saved. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Campo do Medo"" (""Field of the Fear"")",In the Tall Grass
2,nogodnomasters,Just follow my voice,6,15 October 2019,"Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) is expecting and her brother Cal (Avery Whitted ) is driving her cross country to San Diego without taking the Interstate so there can be a story. Her boyfriend Travis (Harrison Gilbertson ) is not expected to be a good father. They pull over by the Church of Black Rock the Redeemer. There is a cry for help in the tall grass. A child is lost in the grass and can't get out. Our couple goes in to rescue the boy as time and space become warped. Within the field is a large black rock with ancient carvings. They meet another couple and their son. They can't walk out.This is a film right out of the Twilight Zone.

3,kosmasp,Don't go in there,7,7 March 2020,"Stephen King - I should have known. All the ingredients are there. So as you can guess then, I have not read the novel this is based on. But I did like the basic idea/theme this is build upon. Actually the very beginning is very strong and that carries throughout the movie.While it does that, the movie itself feels like it loses a bit of traction, once every character and piece is introduced. I can only imagine (no pun intended), how this is written and how much plays in the mind of the reader. As a movie there are limitations, especially when it comes to one dimensional portrayals - or what feels like paper thin motivation at least. Still enough suspense here and overall a good horror movie.",In the Tall Grass
4,classicsoncall,"""The field doesn't move dead things.""",7,15 September 2020,"High growing vegetation doesn't seem to be Stephen King's strong suit, at least when it comes to movie adaptations. Of the thirty two films based on King's work that I've watched and reviewed (you can check my list on IMDb), 1984's ""Children of the Corn"" comes in at #29, while this one shows up at #31 when ranked in IMDb rating order, 2004's ""Riding the Bullet"" comes in dead last, with no pun intended using the word 'dead'.I think the problem might be that there doesn't seem to be any coherent logic for the death and revival of the characters in the picture. The time loop aspect of the story tends to confuse more than illuminate, while the religious connotations ascribed to The Church of the Black Rock of the Redeemer are somewhat circumspect. What's effective though is the way in which King takes a rather mundane subject and turns it into a horror show, much the way he did with a St. Bernard named Cujo. I have a feeling that the novella upon which this movie is based does a better job of eliciting the terror King attempts to convey, one which I haven't had the pleasure to read, but will now be looking for. There's something about the surreal imagery of the gnarled root-hands that doesn't come across on screen the way I think King might have conveyed with the written word.Still, it's Stephen King, and that makes it worth a look if you're a fan. You'll note that one of the things he does quite often is interject a nostalgic tribute to a song or TV show from his formative years, in this case a recurring tribute to the song 'Midnight Special' popularized by Creedence Clearwater Revival. It's a traditional folk song thought to have originated among prisoners in the American South, the chorus referring to a myth that if the light from the Midnight Special shone on a prison inmate in his cell, he would be released soon. With that understanding, the whole idea of escaping from the tall grass makes a lot more sense, and was a neat way for King to tie the fate of innocent travelers into a recurring nightmare .",In the Tall Grass
5,Tweekums,Will siblings Becky and Cal ever get out of the tall grass?,7,4 November 2021,"Brother and pregnant sister, Cal and Becky DeMuth are driving through Kansas on their way to San Diego when they stop by a large field of eight foot high grass. They hear the voice of a young boy, Tobin, calling for help. He is lost in the grass. Cal heads in, followed by Becky. She can't be more than a few yards behind him but they immediately become separated. They shout to each other but it seems the voices are constantly coming from different places... within the grass the normal rules of time and space seem not to apply. Walking through the grass they eventually meet Tobin and his parents and are shown a strange boulder in the middle of the field. Later Travis, the father of Becky's baby, arrives looking for her.This film, based on a novella by Stephan King and his son, has an interesting premise although it does perhaps go on a bit too long. The field of tall grass may be a fairly basic setting but it is highly effective. The way the grass closes in around the characters creates an impressive sense of claustrophobia which is only increased when they learn the normal rules of time and space don't apply. Tension raises nicely as the story progresses. At times it is more than a little confusing; that is clearly deliberate as it helps put the viewer in a similar frame of mind to those lost in the field. The acting is pretty solid; young Will Buie Jr is delightfully creepy as Tobin. There are a couple of gory moments but nothing too disturbing. Overall a decent enough low budget horror film that is worth a watch for horror fans.",In the Tall Grass
6,searchanddestroy-1,Night Shyamalan goes Picnic at Hanging Rock,8,5 October 2019,"This tremendous little creepy film is attractive enough to glue you from start to the end. OK, there is not real action, nor bloody or gore effects but who cares? I thiught about a Night Shyamalan stuff, as he did fifteen years ago: remember him in the 2000s, his golden years. And I also thought about Peter Weir's masterpiece: PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK too. Maybe it should have been better a little shorter, but that's my own opinion.",In the Tall Grass
7,Calicodreamin,"Creepy, but lackluster",4,7 October 2019,"While there was a definite creep factor to this movie, it lacked all around. The acting was okay, the cinematography was okay, the premise was okay. Im fuzzy on the actual storyline, different groups of people enter the grass which is a time loop controlled by the wildly maniac Wilson... who's being controlled by a rock. I'll admit I wasn't always sure what was going, people dead then alive, the time loop, the rock... it was all a bit much. Then about 3/4 in the whole thing collapses into utter weirdness.",In the Tall Grass
8,view_and_review,We Were Given So Much Yet Not Enough,6,6 October 2019,"""Children of the Corn"" already had me fearful of cornfields so I didn't need another movie to make me afraid of tall foliage. ""In the Tall Grass"" was just enough to make me wary of any dense herbage taller than me.Cinematically this was a beauty. The plot was a fascinating one to start but then came some problems. I liked the plot and the mystery of it until they started flirting with time loops. Once the little boy Tobin entered the grass a second time I knew then that we were dealing with a temporal loop to some degree. Temporal loop movies are fun but they always beg the question: which came first, the chicken or the egg.We're led to believe that Tobin and family were the first to enter the grass thereby luring in the pregnant Becky and her brother Cal. Travis came looking for Becky and Cal months later and was also lured into the grass. Then we find out that Tobin was first lured in the grass by Travis calling his name. BUT... Travis only knew Tobin's name because he'd seen him in the grass before. And hence the temporal loop problem. Who started it?Putting the temporal loop aside there were still a lot of questions. What was that stone? How did it get there? What did it want? How many people were in there?One of the biggest questions was: what was the real message here?Just hear me out.We have a pregnant Becky. She's on her way to San Diego but we really don't know why initially. Along the way there they make a stop and go into the creepy grass forest to rescue a boy. Throughout this tall grass experience we get some exposition.We find out that the father is out of the picture, the responsibility was too much for him. Somewhere in there (either before the father shows up or after) we find out that he wanted her to get an abortion. And we find out that she contemplated an abortion. She obviously opted to not get an abortion but she is going to San Diego to give the child up.This is not me making any type of statement for or against abortion, but I couldn't help but think there was anti-abortion/pro-life message in there. Why were they the ones stuck in the grass temporal loop? Then there were the images of the fetus being attacked by grass within the womb. And who could forget the scene where she's eating her baby. Almost as if to show that aborting or giving up your baby is equal in barbarity.You take all of that, plus the fact that Travis had to stay in the grass (bad guy because he suggested abortion and abandoned his girlfriend), and the fact that she decided to go back to Kansas instead of going to San Diego; I couldn't help but draw an anti-abortion conclusion. Either that or an anti-San Diego conclusion and that doesn't make any sense.I'm not saying that was the message, just saying that's how my brain works. I can accept someone telling me I'm way off base here. Also I'm not saying it made it a bad movie although that didn't help.The movie was eerie, chilling, claustrophobic, and hopeless but I wanted to know why. I know you don't always get answers, but I think I deserved more answers than they gave. This movie gave us so much and at the same time not enough.",In the Tall Grass
9,Wizard-8,"Not really terrible, but unsatisfying",4,6 October 2019,"As you probably know, cinematic adaptations of Stephen King's writings run all over the map, some being good and some being bad. This one kind of falls into the middle. It does bring with it a somewhat intriguing premise, one that occasionally brings in a good idea. Other good points with the movie include that it's acceptably acted and reasonably well produced. However, the movie eventually becomes tiresome to watch. Although it only runs 101 minutes in length, it feels much too long for its own good, and for a bulk of the time it just seems to be repeating itself over and over. The (mostly) unchanging backdrop just makes this worse. Also, while the movie does bring in a few good ideas, there are just as many (if not more so) unanswered questions. I do realize that a little mystery can be a good (and scary) thing, but the long list of unexplained things in the end seems to feel more like writer's laziness. This is some distance from being branded a terrible movie, but all the same I think potential viewers will be better off skipping it, even if they are Stephen King fans.",In the Tall Grass
10,Aaron1375,Basically if you replace the fog of Silent Hill with grass,4,8 October 2019,"The trailer for this movie made it seem like it was going to be interesting. I saw that and thought, ""I wonder what is going on in this film, I'm sure it will be an interesting story."" So, I looked forward to seeing it and now that I have, I have to say it was meh. The premise was interesting, the execution was lackadaisical and honestly, either Stephen King or his son must be a huge Silent Hill fan as this film felt like Silent Hill only less interesting. Also, going to say this now, it sure would have been nice to be given some hints as to what was happening in this movie!The story has a creepy brother driving his sister who is pregnant to San Diego. She ends up having to vomit so the brother pulls over to the side of the road where there is a field of tall grass. Within, the sister hears a boy pleading for help and at one point a woman's voice warning the brother and sister not to come in. They do and find themselves in the tall grass where things do not operate normally. The woman's boyfriend comes looking and he too, becomes trapped within the strange landscape of mud and grass and bad CGI effects (seriously, not that many death scenes, why not practical effects?) Can they get out and will they clue us in on what the whole reasoning is behind the strange field that entraps people within?The answer to letting us know is no. I notice something that happens in horror a lot that can ruin a film and that is revealing what is going on. A horror film too often reveals too much and it also oftentimes reveals too little. We have the latter here as this film gives us the viewers almost no information about what is going on. There is a rock in the middle of the field with drawings on it and the field seems alive, but why is never even hinted at. The bowling alley even suggests a town was once in the area and succumbed to the grass, but instead of leading to some sort of insight, it instead seems a pointless location that is one of the main things that pointed me in the direction of this being very Silent Hill like.So, thought it was going to be good, but just did not like being left in the dark. A field in the middle of nowhere, where there was apparently a town and people become lost within the tall grass and we get nothing and are just supposed to roll with it? No, sorry, does not work at all. Perhaps the book revealed something, but if not, I'm afraid Stephen King just plain wrote this with the whole idea of being lost in grass and there is no meaning beyond it. There was nothing beyond the thought process other than, ""Oh no, we can't get out of field"" and then add a few things to pad the story. You have to at least leave clues for the viewer to come up with something, otherwise, they are like the characters in this film, lost.",In the Tall Grass

12,siderite,"Good scary movie, not much else",6,29 April 2021,"The premise of the film is creepy and throughout the movie it doesn't lose its scariness. That being said, there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone and some of the supernatural mechanics make it even harder for anything to have any real consequence. From what I understand, the difference between the novella and the film is the ending and some extra characters, both superfluous or uninspired, as the scenes generated by the extra characters are quite boring and unnecessary.Bottom line: If you ignore the bland characters, the film is quite disturbing. However the choice of the plot to rob them of all agency makes the entire story pointless and the stuff they added to pad the content of the original novella doesn't help at all.",In the Tall Grass

14,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Disappointing King adaptation, that fails to make the most of its potential",4,8 October 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCal De Muth (Avery Whitted) and his heavily pregnant sister Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) break down near a large, grassy field. Suddenly, they hear a child's voice crying out from the grass, crying for rescue. Instinctively chasing after it, they find themselves lost in a labyrinth maze of grass, until Cal encounters a young boy named Tobin (Will Buie Jr.) who appears to be the child who cried for help. Eventually, he brings them into contact with Ross (Patrick Wilson), a man who claims to be his father. Eventually, Travis (Harrison Gilbertson), Becky's estranged partner and father of her unborn child, arrives on the scene, and all of them are plunged into a desperate battle for survival.Stephen King is truly back in business. Hell, we can even say we have Kingbusiness going on! After the phenomenal success of It, new adaptations of his works appear to be spiralling back out at the bucket load, with the new version of Pet Sematary released earlier in the year, the recent It Chapter Two (still in cinemas) and the upcoming Shining follow up Doctor Sleep (at the end of this month, I believe) and streaming giant Netflix don't appear to have their eyes shut to his appeal. And so we have this production from director Vincenzo Natali, which is a collaboration between him and a guy called Joe Hill.This is a typical King set up in every sense of the word, from the characters, to the location, to the framework of the story. I've seen so many adaptations of his work that I could picture how it's been written without even reading the novel. And as such, it sets a reliably creepy atmosphere and sense of intrigue and foreboding, with a small, centralized set of characters you can count on one hand. Sadly, though, none of them prove engaging enough or are developed in any way that you really care about any of them, despite Wilson's presence as the possessed madman, further hindered by a story that fails to make much sense or provide much in the way of a satisfying resolution.Probably the creepiest and most effective thing about it is the actual tall grass, with the fierce Indian chants coming from it, and the unsettling way it appears to fold over and trap whoever's inside it. But, when the scariest thing about your movie is some large, bending grass, what does that really say? **",In the Tall Grass

The film features good performances from the small cast, and has a constant foreboding atmosphere.However, as with most Stephen King penned stories, 'In the tall grass' went from creepy and interesting, to weird and mysterious, to bizarre. It's going to be really hard describing this movie to someone. Although it will be best to see it for yourself, I honestly can't really recommend the film. There are some genuinely creepy moments with effective jump scares, but ultimately the payoff just wasn't worth it.If you're into this sort of confusing storyline, rather watch the 2009 film 'Triangle', which was similar themed but far better.Would I watch it again? No.",In the Tall Grass
19,cruise01,Decent thriller with a flat story.,7,9 October 2019,"In the Tall Grass (3.5 out of 5 stars).In the Tall Grass is a supernatural horror film that has a little mystery with its story even though it is a little thin. The direction, performances, and some creepy moments is worth looking at. It may not be as scary but it does offer some thrills.The plot follows siblings Cal (Avery Whitted) and Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) who are travelling on a road trip. They come across a tall grass field and hear a scream for help. Sounding like a boy. They stop to search for the boy which they get lost in a neverending field. They come across something supernatural out in the field with some unusual activity. While Becky finds Ross (Patrick Wilson) who is also searching for his family.The plot is thin. There really is not much to the story. The concept and mystery idea about a field that people hear voices in. And the day goes by quick or it could be in there head that they are stuck in it for a long time. The film kind of is like The Shining but being in a grass field instead. There is some supernatural force in the center of the field that is causing people to hallucinate.The direction does deliver some thrills and a mystery concept. The mystery idea of people coming across dead bodies in the field which they may know. The idea of time travel is also at play as well. Without giving away spoiler of the plot. The climax gets a little creepy and weird with Becky trying to fight for survival. The ending will leave people asking questions and definitely one that will leave you asking about what just happened.Patrick Wilson was fair with his role playing Ross a family man. Laysla De Oliveira was good playing Becky, a young girl who is conflicted with her life while dealing with her pregnancy. Avery Whitted plays Cal who is a helpful and supportive brother to Becky. Harrison Gilbertson plays Travis who is Becky's boyfriend who is obsessed in searching for her.Overall, In the Tall Grass is a pretty fair film. It delivers some thrills and the mystery behind the field is interesting. The performances are good. The story is a little thin. It does lack some scares. The film could have been a whole lot worse.",In the Tall Grass
20,eddie_baggins,Another failed cinematic King outing,4,7 October 2019,"By now, we as audiences are well and truly aware of the pot luck style expectations that come with any cinematic Stephen King adaptation.From the highs to the very very lows, King feature film treatments can give us the very best and very worst of cinema, with new Netflix property In the Tall Grass one of those adaptations that shows promise but sadly falters in the majority, as its strange and unexplained concept runs out of stem early on in a visually arresting film that offers very little else in terms of memorability or recommendable aspects.Adapted from a joint project between King and his son Joe Hill, Grass is a uniquely constructed horror setting that sees brother and sister duo Becky and Cal DeMuth enter into a seemingly innocuous Kansas state field when they hear some cries for help on the side of the highway, only to find themselves battling an evil rock, time travel occurrences and a bloodthirsty Patrick Wilson, as the duo are joined by Becky's estranged partner Travis in a never ending grassy hell that has entrapped the group.Directed by Cube filmmaker Vincenzo Natali, who despite adding some nice visual verve to the film here and some wince-inducing acts of horror carnage is still struggling as a director to match the highs of his 1997 breakout hit, Grass starts out promising enough as we are kept on edge with the strange occurrences going on around the DeMuth's but as the runtime wears on and answers remain anything but forthcoming, it's hard to enjoy much of Grass's happenings when there's so little care to offer any type of specific information on what is happening or why it's happening.There's nothing worse than being spoon-fed information in a film like this but there's also something to be said in a negative fashion when a film cares so little for explaining itself and after 30 to 40 minutes of an abundance of grassy shots, characters running around aimlessly in a field and gross out violence that doesn't mean that much when characters appear to be stuck in an endless loop of horrors, Grass quickly becomes more of a chore to sit through than a ghastly enjoyable experience.It's an experience that feels like a missed opportunity come the end credits, for a Netflix original Grass has a nice professional feel to it and Wilson is having the time of his life playing real estate agent turned rock worshipper Ross Humboldt but the unique set-up of the film and central plotline never gets out of first gear, halting Natali's film in its muddy tracks.Final Say -Fans of green grass will be in for a luscious treat in Netflix's In the Tall Grass but despite a great start and some intriguing concepts, this is another addition to the increasingly large portion of forgettable Stephen King adaptations that failed to live up to their potential.2 abandoned bowling alleys out of 5",In the Tall Grass
21,TheMovieDiorama,In The Tall Grass is overgrown with flimsy dialogue and a premise that needed landscaping.,4,2 January 2020,"Stephen King seems to have an endless amount of material to adapt. So much so, that his son is mimicking the footsteps of his father by also writing horror-related fiction. When the two generations joined together to write a novella on a mysterious field, it should've harked back to King's legacy as the legendary writer he once was. Sadly though, despite the faithfulness to the source material, it's yet another King story unable to translate comprehensibly into a full-length feature. Two siblings, with one six months pregnant, stop outside an old church and venture into an endless field of tall grass when they hear a child yearning for help. This field however is enshrouded with a mysterious force that prevents anyone who enters from leaving, and so the two must survive the oddities of the tall grass before ""something"" or ""someone"" endangers them.Massive 'Triangle' vibes from this story, except its conceptual complexities are less innovative and more mundane. Past, present and future selves are lurking within the swaying echoes of the tall grass, conveniently outlining the rules and boundaries of the field's power. ""The grass won't move dead things"" states an embattled young boy, whom had been lost for days. ""The rock is the way out!"". Paradoxical in nature, this story had the capacity to be both atmospheric and tense, given the frustratingly claustrophobic environment. Alas, was not meant to be. Despite Wrobleski's stunning cinematography that encapsulated the natural order of the field through stylised motion, particularly when visualising the field to be a living entity of its own, Natali's one-dimensional screenplay forced certain characters actions and personalities to be questionably dull.The extent of characterisation can only be surmised by the pitch at which they shout for each other. For example, Cal continually shouting ""Becky? Becky? Becky with the good hair!?"" is the maximum capacity at which we feel for his character. Becky then shouts for ""Cal!"". Travis waltzes on in and shouts for ""Becky?"" and ""Tobin!"". Ross is just shouting at himself about real estate. His wife is the most expendable individual with nearly zero lines (shouting included!). And the dog had more screen presence than the majority of characters. The dialogue felt inorganic, starkly contrasting the entire premise. Yes, the performances were all functional with what the actors were given, although Wilson as always goes above and beyond. But it's not enough to carry a supernatural mystery that seeks to explain everything almost immediately. Unable to classify it as a horror, considering there was no legitimate threat/tension, although some eye-wincing gore was well-utilised.The third act commences and the plot's lunacy ramped up from confusion to diabolically non-sensical. Without spoiling it, stuff happens near a rock that resembled an incarnate of King's worst tendencies in fictional writing. Unnecessary ""creatures"" are added into the mix, ironically adding nothing to the story. Then, as all films featuring time loops end, the characters miraculously close the loop before it even happened. So, what's the point? Did they honestly learn anything from this ordeal to which they hadn't actually experienced? Urgh.It's abundantly clear that Natali was unable to stretch King's novella into a feature-length film, despite being a faithful adaptation. The technical excellence was dimmed by flimsy writing and limited characterisation that forced this supernatural mystery to be anything but mysterious. This is why we should all purchase a portable lawnmower, you never know when you'll be stuck eternally in a field with a giant ancient rock in the middle...",In the Tall Grass
22,Fella_shibby,I got trapped into this purgatory only after seeing Patrick Wilson in the trailer. Weak plot stretched unnecessary into 101 mins of boring grasses n wtf stone.,4,5 October 2019,"The trailer is enticing, the names associated is even more enticing.
I saw this only cos of Patrick Wilson. Stephen King's name wasn't suffice to pull me into this purgatory.
It is directed by Vincenzo Natali, the guy who gave us Cube, an awesome thriller. In this film he takes the similar concept from his previous movie Haunter which is decent compared to this.There is unnecessary repetitive scenes of a pregnant woman screaming, irritating scenes of blurred visions, 101 mins of jus grass swaying which gets repetitive n boring.

24,southdavid,Silly Sod.,4,18 November 2019,"This adaptation of a Stephen King/Joe Hill short story is intriguing in concept and occasionally execution but ultimately I came away disappointed.Brother and Sister Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) and Cal (Avery Whitted) head into a field of tall grass to try and rescue a young boy who's shouting for help from inside. Once inside, the natural disorientation of the field is enhanced by seemingly supernatural forces that separate the pair and work to keep them apart. Following the natural feelings of panic and frustration, Becky and Cal soon discover that they are not the only inhabitants of the field.Why didn't I like ""In the Tall Grass"". . . I suppose that I wanted more of an explanation of what was really going on, than the film was really willing to give me. There is an awful lot of expansion required here to get the film up to feature length, in fact apart from the characters and the location it's a very different story than the one it's adapted from. With all that opportunity created by the development it's unfortunate that the film manages largely to be so dull and repetitive. I feel like I'm supposed to do the work putting together what the rock was about, for example, and I wonder if I'm doing that more from what I know from other Stephen King stories rather than what I was actually detailed in this film.The performances on the whole aren't anything special. Patrick Wilson gets to ham it up a bit in his nice turn as the father of the lost boy, but the rest of the cast don't leave much of an impression. The visual effects are excellent, there's one decent ""descent into hell"" type shot that is outstanding and the audio mixing is pretty good (one of the rare movies where such a thing actually stands out).I was eager to like this, and there were aspects of it that I did, but they were undercut by tedious sections and unexplained elements. I don't think it was as awful as some of my fellow reviewers have, but it's definitely not good.",In the Tall Grass
25,jtindahouse,A stupid story with bland characters and nothing to redeem it,4,9 October 2019,"I remember 'Family Guy' once making a joke about how Stephen King just looks at an item in the room (in their example a desk lamp) and decides that will be the topic of his next book. It's kind of hard to argue with that when he starts writing about grass. At least when he wrote about corn back in the day he threw some evil children into the mix as well. The result is a pretty unwatchable film on this occasion.These are the laziest types of stories in existence. Nothing is explained and of course anything that you need to drive your story forward can and will happen. Time travel? Sure. Teleportation? Why not. And if a character dies in one scene, don't worry they'll likely be back in the next. Add in that the characters were about as bland as they ever come and you have yourself a pretty unenjoyable movie. In fact it is almost impossible to root for or care about a single character in this movie because less than zero time is spent building them up as characters.Even Patrick Wilson, one of my favourite actors working today, couldn't save this mess unfortunately - although I'll give him credit, he did try valiantly. There's just nothing good here. It's a movie that repeats itself over and over and has nothing to say about anything. It is as pointless as films come. I'm very glad this one came to Netflix, because I'm the sucker who probably would've paid to see it in cinemas and been very disappointed. Avoid this one.",In the Tall Grass

All evoking an almost primal, sense of dread. On the downside, it comes across as almost, esoteric, in a dark kind of a way. Catering to a certain kind of viewer, who likes things open ended, with allusion taking the place of a concrete plot.Regrettably, that's not me for the most part.

But the premise is intriguing enough, and before the third act there's some really solid idea floating around there, it's just not as tight as it should be. Patrick Wilson really is the reason to see this one, he's simply marvelous as the antagonist, I'll watch whatever he does.

33,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Concepts with a Creepy Setting,9,6 October 2019,"This was a film that kind of came out of nowhere. I did a news article on it for a site that I write for and I made the plan of seeing this. It really helped as well that a horror movie challenge I'm doing so that solidified the plan. I'm also a massive Stephen King fan, so seeing that he co-wrote the novella with his son Joe Hill, which also caught my eye. The synopsis here is after hearing a young boy's cry for help, a sister and brother venture into a vast field of tall grass in Kansas, but soon discover there may be no way out...and that something evil lurks within.We start this off with a couple in a car. Becky DeMuth (Laysla De Oliveira) and she's pregnant. The driver is her brother Cal (Avery Whitted). She gets nauseous watching him eat a burger and has him pull over. She throws up. Behind them is a church and they're next to a field of tall grass. As they're deciding what to do, Becky hears a boy calling for help. His mother tries to get him to stop, but he doesn't listen. The siblings then go into the tall grass to find him.It really takes a turn though as the boy's voice keeps changing position. Cal tells him to stop moving and the boy tells him that he's not. The siblings also get separated from each other. Cal does find the boy, Tobin Humbolt (Will Buie Jr.). He looks like he's been in here a while and is dirty. Tobin tells him that he'll help him find his sister, but that she's going to die soon.Also in this grass are Tobin's parents, Ross (Patrick Wilson) and Natalie (Rachel Wilson). Becky runs into Ross and the two of them go about finding their way. Things aren't as they seem and with Becky's condition doesn't help. The only things that they know are that when something dies, they don't move and that there's this weird rock in a clearing. Travis McKean (Harrison Gilberston) comes looking for Becky and gets caught in this same nightmare as well. Is there a way out of here and what is going on in the tall grass?As I started out to saying in this, I'm a big fan of King and I'm starting to get more in Hill. I think this has a really interesting concept. I grew up in the country for a good portion of my life and I'll admit, cornfields are scary. This tall grass is similar to that in it is taller than the characters and is disorienting when they get inside of it. Now clearly the cornfields I've been in, I can just leave. Making this supernatural is something that is quite creepy if I'm honest.Going from this supernatural aspect, this film features time travel/time loop/alternative dimensions, which is something else I'm a big fan of. I definitely am a firm believer that time is a flat circle and that we only think of it how we do is that it is the only way we can comprehend. We get this interesting thing where the film shows us Becky and Cal arriving, we see their story playing out, but then we get to see Travis as he shows up as well as the Humboldt family. The 'order' of events really had me sucked me. I'm so interested in this concept. If the movie wanted to explain a bit more, I could be down for that. I'm also fine with it as no one really seems to know aside from this giant rock is the reason so I can see not explaining it more with something that's cheesy.There are some deeper issues that are explored here as well, which if you know me is something I really like. Becky is pregnant and Travis is the father. We learn more about their strained relationship which I did enjoy. Cal at first seems like a good guy, but we slowly get the reveal of his character. Ross is much in the same way and I really like the madness he descends into. There's a slight issue of doing bad things and also some incestuous feelings.From there I'll move to the pacing. My overall feel is that it's good. I do think that is runs a tad long. With some of the things we keep seeing, trimming that to show us a bit more of the nightmarish things would have worked better for me. I do think that it builds tension as the panic sets in for these people. I also think that the editing is good in introducing us to the characters and transitioning the stories to be interwoven together. I did also really like the ending and how dark it really decided to go.That will then take me to the acting. I thought that Oliveira was fine as the main lead. What is interesting about this character is the growth that she is going through. We know that she is pregnant, which does raise the stakes there. The more that is revealed about her and this trip, we do get to see her grow into the person we need at the end. Much in the different way, Whitted is good as his character goes dark the more we learn about him. I thought that was also a fine performance. Wilson though is great. There really is something off about him from the beginning and I love the descent into madness he has. Gilbertson was also pretty solid and much like Becky, I like the growth of his character and decision he has to make. Buie and the rest of the cast were fine for what was needed as well.I'll shift this to the effects of the movie. I will start on the negative side as there were a couple spots of bad CGI. Thinking about it on the whole, there's not a lot so that is positive. There were just a couple things that happen where it took me out of it. The practical effects we get though are great and the location used is so creepy. This setting in the tall grass is so disorienting and creepy. The film is also shot very well, which definitely helps.Now with that said, I actually really enjoyed this movie. I thought there are some really interesting concepts here with the alternative dimensions and time loops that tick boxes for me. Going even farther than that though, we get the darkness of humanity as characters reveal their true selves. I thought that the acting really helps to bring that to life. I do think that the pacing and editing were solid, it was just a bit too long for some of the things we focused on. There were a couple of moments of bad CGI, but the effects on the whole are good. The soundtrack really didn't stand out to me, but it also fit for what was needed. I do think that this is a really good movie and I'll definitely need to check out this novella.",In the Tall Grass

41,petra_ste,All scares and no lore makes horror a bore,5,5 October 2020,"The very King-esque premise was intriguing and the ending decent but, as something of a King fan, this was mostly a disappointment. Here's the problem: ""anything goes"". It's a big issue with supernatural horror. Trying to explain everything like a math test is a tragic mistake but, on the other end of the spectrum, a random collection of creepy-but-repetitive vignettes isn't much better.Horror needs some kind of rules and lore to work. Not a rational explanation, no. But a framework for our fears, yes. Let's see other better works by King. Salem's Lot vampires are taking over the town but have to follow some rules (avoid sunlight, enter houses only when invited in). The creatures in ""The Mist"" may come from another dimension or not, it doesn't matter: don't go outside or they will eat you, but they can't materialize out of thin air or pass through walls. See what I mean?Here, the unfortunate protagonists enter a mysterious field and get trapped into a sort of eldritch maze/temporal loop. Some kind of evil rock lies at the center of it. Touching the rock turns you crazy and evil, except when it does not. Grass-faced people inhabit the place, except when they do not, and can attack/capture those lost in the field, except when they can not. People die but then other iterations of them appear alive again: when you realize they can try again and again after every failure and death, as in some kind of Lovecraftian Groundhog Day, the stakes crumble into dust. There is a rather horrific scene where a character meets her demise, is mourned... and then walks onscreen alive and well from another direction. Oh, okay.5/10",In the Tall Grass

44,kjproulx,Wasted Potential,3,29 October 2019,"Netflix wasn't known for producing great films when they first started but rather produced some great television shows instead. Nowadays, with films like Roma being up for best picture, Eddie Murphy making his return in Dolemite is My Name, and Martin Scorsese releasing his three and a half hour epic gangster film in The Irishman, they are nothing short of being all-in. Sadly, for every great film, they're still releasing a poor one as well, and that's the case with the latest Stephen King adaptation, In the Tall Grass. While it had a promising premise and some unique ideas, it never fully grasps where those ideas should lead. Here's why I don't think this movie is worth your time, even as a casual watch on Netflix.
Stopping on the side of the road during a long drive, siblings Becky and Cal venture out into a field of endless, tall grass after hearing the cry of a young boy. Learning that this location has much more going on under the surface, other characters appear and other-worldly things begin to happen. Playing with time and horror, this is a premise that has a lot going for it but ultimately fails. Sadly, another aspect that didn't help the wasted potential, was the fact that the cast just really wasn't all that good. That's saying a lot coming from me because Patrick Wilson actually gets quite a bit of screentime, and I usually love his performances.
Laysla De Oliveira and Avery Whitted lead this film for the most part until other characters begin to appear, and while I can see the potential for them in the future, I haven't seen either of them in a film before and it really does show throughout. I will cut them some slack though because I truly feel the biggest culprit here is the screenplay. I was shocked to see Vincenzo Natali's name all over this film, because Paris, je t'aime is a fantastic film by him and I also quite enjoyed his little horror film, Splice. For these reasons alone I was interested in In the Tall Grass, but his dialogue here could have really used some work. Even less of it and using the score to keep the movie ominous I believe would have helped, but that's just my opinion.
The absolute best thing I can say about this film is the fact that it's actually nicely shot from start to finish. Known for working on very popular shows like Fargo, Legion, and The Umbrella Academy, his extensive resume shines through here and is on full display. If an award had to be given to any aspect of this movie, it would surely be for the cinematography. If for nothing else, I enjoyed looking at this movie. Truthfully, I believe the camerawork is what kept my attention the whole time.
In the end, In the Tall Grass begins with a promising concept, but is bogged down by a confusing finale, subpar dialogue, a cast that deserved to be in a better film, and direction that was very off, which is really saying something, seeing who was behind the camera and story here. There's no way I can get myself to recommend this movie to anyone, except for maybe suggesting it to cinematographers who like to shoot horror films. Good in theory, but gad in execution.",In the Tall Grass

51,jwwalrath-227-85487,Makes grass scary,8,23 October 2019,"Based on the novella by the father-son team of Stephen King and Hoe HIll, this film continues the King tradition of bringing horror out of common things. In this case, long grass can be pretty freaky. There have been instances where people or children have gotten lost and died of dehydration in corn fields. The same principle applies here. A brother and sister end up lost in a field of tall grass and even before things start getting weird the film does a great job of showing the usual unpleasantness of being stuck out in the heat and the mud.The freaky stuff equally helps make this film. I don't know if I'd call this the scariest film ever, but it does a good job of being uneasy or uncomfortable. A fair part of this is the scares being subtle but when the nasty stuff happens: it is definitely memorable. There is one thing in particular you won't see coming.This is one of those horror films that plays a little too fast and loose with the rules of how things work for some viewers tastes.Director VIncenzo Natali (who directed Splice) has a good eye for visuals here. There are so many shots and computer and set designs that stand out. However, the computer graphics can be a bit obvious at points.Mostly decent cast, but the standout is Patrick Wilson. I won't go into detail, but he really gets the chance to play more of a character role than he usually gets. I did have issues with Will Buie Jr., the movie's only child actor. The issue isn't that he's a bad actor. He's given dialogue that just sounds too adult.

We have seen this hackneyed trope in a thousand other stories and movies, including King stories like Carrie, the Mist, Children of the Corn, and others. Enough is enough. This sort of character was interesting in Cary because it was actually relevant to the story and hadn't already been done a million times. In In the Tall Grass it is an eye-rolling cliche.Another irritating element in the movie is the inclusion of another tired old trope - nativist/paganesque chanting at different moments in the score, a cliche we have heard in a million other movies.This movie might be worth one viewing if you're looking for a way to pass an hour and 40 minutes, but it is not something I would ever watch a second time.",In the Tall Grass

With that said, I thought the concept here was really good. The idea was interesting and it had lots of potential. The filming of the grass was really cool and the acting was good as well. Unfortunately the movie is quite pointless. I can sum it up it in one line: people are lost in the grass and evil is all around them. That's it. There's not a real plot in here. What's the story? What's the background story? It's all very vague, some sort of ancient evil in the grass and that's it. It's a slow burner and it gets boring at times.

58,stevenrotherforth,Great concept poorly executed.,6,20 October 2019,"In The Tall GrassMaybe it's just me but don't you feel modern horror movies are high in concept but low in execution?
(And I don't mean execution in the physical sense!;)In The Tall Grass immediately grabbed my attention due to its simple yet effective premise.
Two young adults stop at the side of the road adjacent to a field of tall grass. They hear the cries of a small boy lost in the vegetation. They go into the field to try and find him and also become lost.
Boom! Simple as that!
Think 'Jaws' with grass.
Think 'The Blair Witch Project' but without the witch.
Whilst this movie starts out rather promising it like many of today's horror movies soon falls into madness.
What ever happened to less is more?
This is perhaps why I referred to 'Jaws'
Not seeing the shark was the most frightening part of the movie.
Not knowing what's going on is the most terrifying thing for those onscreen and the audience. Hence 'The Blair witch' comparison.
Why does Hollywood feel it has to over explain and explore everything?
The very fact that these characters are lost in a field that is obviously haunted is frightening enough.
Just let the audience go along for the ride.
Make us feel that we are there with these scared and confused people onscreen.
The fact that we don't know why these things are happening is much more terrifying.With strong central performances from its young cast we also get support from Patrick Wilson who was probably added to the cast to add a little weight to the project.
Whilst his performance is good his character was never really needed.
Instead focusing on the frightened youngsters trying to escape may have made for a more gripping piece of entertainment rather then the OTT path the film eventually takes down.
That said this film does offer much enjoyment. Mainly in the first half.What is most impressive about this movie is something I constantly bring up in my reviews of Netflix material.
Picture and audio quality.
This movie looks absolutely stunning.
Presented in Dolby Vision the image is crisp and vibrant.
Resolution is off the chart with a digital grain free image. Every blade of grass is rendered to perfection with HDR bringing out the subtle colour changes in the surrounding vegetation.
Night time scenes are beautifully lit with no loss of detail.
Skin tones look natural with every bead of sweat and dirt visible. The heat of the sun can be felt as the characters on screen perspire. This helping give a sense of claustrophobia as they become increasingly trapped
amongst the undergrowth.Audio quality is also fantastic. The Dolby Atmos mix is very effective.
The use of surround and height channels project voices all around the soundstage.
Because the characters can't always see each other amongst the grass this gives the audience the sensation that they too are lost within the confides of the field.
Many a time the impressive mix had me looking over my shoulder wondering where the voices were coming from.
Bass is used sparingly here.
This is a sound mix that impressed with it's wide soundstage.
It's not thunderous. It is eerie and unsettling.Overall 'In The Tall Grass'
fails as a movie. The concept is good in theory but is never utilised to full potential. But due to some wonderful 4K imagery and a sublime Dolby Atmos sound mix. If you are a fan of the genre and have a dedicated Home theatre system. This is a film worth checking out.",In the Tall Grass
59,TwistedContent,"Technically Impressive, Narratively Lacking - It's an Enjoyable Mixed Bag",7,4 October 2019,"This is the 3rd Netflix feature film Stephen King adaptation (Gerald's Game, 1922) and, for what it's worth, I think they can surely make some more. ""In the Tall Grass"" is not flawless, but it's entertaining, aesthetically pleasing & there's great bits in an otherwise mixed bag.A lot of people are and will call ""In the Tall Grass"" pointless or empty, and it's true that its biggest flaw is the near miniature plot. The story never leads to anything shocking, huge or, well, to nothing quite satisfying enough. The shallowness of the main story line is compensated with shabby side plots of some of the characters. Sadly, I have not expierenced the novella and can't do any comparisons. I've read a LOT of King though. Besides the story, there were other aspects that kept me watching & engaged. Compliments to the cinematographer and camera & sound crews - technically ""In the Tall Grass"" is a treat, the stylistic solutions add a lot to the atmosphere & the sound design is the kind that can give you goosebumps given that you have the hardware of a melomaniac. Besides the technical side of the movie the acting's also top level, as much as it could be taking into account the script & characters. You'll probably find yourself not caring for one or few of them, but if one thing's for sure it's that Patrick Wilson most definitely doesn't fail to entertain. The pacing is quite fine - the middle part might get slower but it picks up again.Overall ""In the Tall Grass"" is a mood piece, if you're not looking for a lot of substance, this is a good horror movie to watch loudly & in the darkness. I'll eat up any Stephen King adaptation and this one's grantedly above average. My rating: 7/10.",In the Tall Grass

61,Mike_Devine,Someone needs to mow this 'Grass',2,30 May 2020,"""Direct-to-Netflix"" is no longer an anchor to weigh down the perception of films, as many have proven to be high quality. But the low-budget adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one that probably should have been left as an idea in someone's head.'Grass' has a bunch of ingredients that are to be expected in a King story - a pinch of supernatural forces, a dash of gore, a bit of time travel thrown in for good measure and plenty of suspense. The problem is, the recipe used to concoct this film is not a good one. 'Grass' suffers from horrible acting (what happened to Patrick Wilson?), a confusing cadence and some unnecessarily unsettling scenes. But perhaps worst of all, 'Grass' lacks any real emotional connection with the characters involved. This complicates things and really drags down the potential of the story.It's definitely worth skipping 'In the Tall Grass' for superior frightening fare.",In the Tall Grass

Besides the artsy nature shots it delivers esp. In the 1st half a claustrophobic atmosphere. The frustration, the glimps of hope and than again the hopelessness. In parts it reminded me a bit of triangle however I found triangle way more more coherent,deep and suspenseful. Tall grass does quite some things well, however it falls into too many pieces (cult? Time travel? Science fiction? Gore?) whereas the initial idea something lures u into the green maze was strong and creepy enough to carry the movie. I would have loved to see more of this.

That's not to say the movie is bad or unrewarding - far from it... The story is tense, clever & interesting but by the time the credits begin rolling, you're undeniably left wanting more - concluding that the creative team behind it had only considered to scratch the mere surface of such potential instead of delving far deeper & fleshing out its ensemble.",In the Tall Grass
64,jamiedarlow-37510,Entertaining and gory!,6,27 June 2020,"Writer/Director Vincenzo Natali (Splice, Cube) has continued the line of impressive Stephen King films this year and it's not a bad addition at all! Based on King's and his son Joe's own novella, the story starts with a brother and sister Becky and Cal (Laysla De Oliveira and Avery Whitted) travelling cross country for a mysterious reason. Stopping for a break half way, they park up outside an isolated church with a huge cornfield directly opposite. A boy cries out for help among the tall grass and they go to investigate, only to discover that something else is with them in the field and their journey out will be harder than they thought... it's a great premise and for the most part executed really well here with the source material being respected as well as it being visually pretty powerful. It's certainly a treat for the eyes with the camera finding more playful ways to weave itself through the greenery. The performances are also good with Patrick Wilson putting in some wonderfully maniacal work. The theme of religion is prodded at and referenced in an interesting way although it never fully utilises its themes or subject well enough to transcend into anything truly scary. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining thriller with some good gory bits along the way",In the Tall Grass
65,DeBBss,Utterly Strange,5,4 October 2019,"In the Tall Grass is a very suspenseful, but strange film. It's a lot to unpack in such a limited movie where there's only five main characters and grass. This film definitely needs a rewatch to grasp all of the themes and foreshadowing, because this movie has a LOT of foreshadowing.In the Tall Grass uses a lot of suspense. Throughout the entire run time there is suspense, and it can be a little overboard. I think the suspense is what makes this film so strange, and I don't think it flat out ruins the movie. I've never read the book version, so I knew nothing about this movie going into it, and I still don't know anything about it after watching it. The climax of the film is crazy and confusing, but there is no explanation to what just happened, so you have to figure out what just happened by yourself. The cinematography is pretty good for a Netflix horror. It puts emphasis on the grass and it makes it feel as if the grass is a character of its own. I liked the atmosphere they created. It makes it feel like the grass is always hiding something, or something is in it. With an atmosphere like that, in makes the movie even more suspenseful. The sound editing is pretty good too, and it has to be good, as there is little music in the movie. When there is music, it's captivating with an eerie tone.In the Tall Grass is amazing technically, the cinematography, atmosphere, sound editing, and music is top notch; I have no complaints about it. What bothers me about the film is the lack of explanation. I know that there is an explanation if you look hard enough, but a little exposition won't kill anyone. In the Tall Grass is style over substance, and that's what ruined it for me. Overall, In the Tall Grass is an average movie in my opinion. There's no ""Correct"" review; some will hate this movie and some will love it, and there's reason why you could love it or hate it. I would recommend this film anyway, as it's better than most of the stuff Netflix has been pumping out recently.",In the Tall Grass

86,RhapsodyReviews,"Entertaining, But Too Confusing.",5,22 October 2019,"Review:
'In the Tall Grass' is a supernatural-horror film directed by Vincenzo Natali. It is based on novella of the same name by Stephen King and Joe Hill.
This is the third Stephen King adaptation to be released as a Netflix original (Gerald's Game, 1922). For what it's worth, I think they can surely make some more. The movie isn't flawless, but it's entertaining, aesthetically pleasing & there's great bits in an otherwise mixed and confusing bag.
The plot of the movie follows siblings Becky and Cal DeMuth (Laysla De Oliveira, Avery Whitted), who are travelling to San Diego so 6-months-pregnant Becky can give up her baby for adoption. While stopping outside an old church, the pair hears a young boy named Tobin (Will Buie Jr.) call for help from a nearby field of tall grass. Upon entering the field, the two soon realize that there is more at play than just finding the kid and leaving. The field is not what it seems.
I thought all the performances were good, which I am always happy when it's an unknown cast of people (aside from Patrick Wilson). I have seen better child acting than what this movie produces but Will Buie Jr. puts on some real creepy vibes with his character of Tobin, and I was impressed.
Where this movie loses a few points is the fact that it already a very confusing plot to follow, and by the end the movie nothing is explained. I don't really consider that to be spoiler, and I'm sorry if you do. Literally nothing is explained as to why or what is happening throughout this entire movie and that's very frustrating. It was entertaining, I will give it that, but if there is no purpose to what we as an audience are watching than what's the point?
Overall, I do want people to go and watch this movie and have a discussion about it. Maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way or maybe I missed something along the way. As I stated it is a well acted and entertaining film, but it leaves us as the viewer in the dark the whole time without any conclusion of what we just watched.

This however falls alittle of the mark. Its not a bad film but the plot seems leaner the spooks seem cheaper and the characters are boring. Plently of gore is shown through out the movie.

90,mirwais-orbit,"Intentions Are Good, But Fails...",4,15 October 2019,"When we think about Vincenzo Natali, we think about Cube. When we think about Cube we expect that Vincenzo would be the perfect one to direct and adapt In The Tall Grass coz the feeling that the characters are trapped forever in a loop is the same. So, the deja vu is pretty clear and obvious.Vincenzo would have been still the perfect one, but the problem about this production is that it probably takes the metaphors not too seriouly to a point that audience never gets the references because, like the characters, they get trapped in a loop of trying to understand things and solve mysteries that are pretty unimportant at first.For those who are already familiar to Stephen King's writing will know that religion, faith, mental and physical violence, family concepts and social issues regarding those references are the base of most of his creative process, bringing them to life as disturbing fantasy and horrifying icons.The church is there to represent heaven, the field of tall grass the purgatory, and the characters the sinners that get far away from their faith as deeper they dive in the grass, while they must discover by themselves what could finally bring them to a spiritual freedom. That's the basics, and the nuances lies among those major metaphors.The problem is that the movie never creates an honest dialog with the audience to make references clear. It tries hard to make it a tortuous gore flick instead. Vicenzo is too worried to impress the audience with horror elements instead of creating a relevant journey to a self redeeming conscious.The screenplay gets lost in itself like the characters in the grass. The icons, the metaphors and allegories are there all the time, but we never feel them and neither get connected to them.That's a shame because 1922, also based on a King's novel and also filled with the same elements, does it amazingly well. The director's intentions were good, but he loses the connection when he forgets that Stephen King is much more subtle and delicate constructing an entire ecosystem on his writing than Vincenzo does on the screen. And the most important thing, King always create a dialog with his readers.",In the Tall Grass

96,snowfre,An overall solid horror film that struggles slightly with plot holes and its length,7,5 October 2019,"So another Stephen King adaption is out, this time it's ""In the Tall Grass"" (which he co-wrote with Joe Hill not to leave anyone out). As with most of the recent King adaptions, it captures the overlaying spooky tone but has a few problems I struggle with. To start this off on the bright side, the acting is above the average performances in the genre, no one really stand out except Patrick Wilson. The cinematography is among the film's highlights together with the mysterious, confusing timelines. Several people are stuck in a large grass field in which they can die, only to be resurrected again with no recollection of what has previously happened. While the entire film leaves you with basically all your questions unanswered, what is most irritating are two things. One, if Ross (Wilson) gets completely mental by touching the big black rock, why didn't Travis (Gilbertson)? Does time corrupt the mind or were they both evil respectively good to start with? Second, who the hell were the grass people. Again, the film won't answer any questions. Not a single one. It was slightly too long in my taste but overall it's an entertaining experience and its originality and unique plot - and setting - is welcomed in a genre in which recurring themes and jump scares are too many.

Yet it is quite an interesting plot device in its simplicity, even though the film, like its protagonists, takes a lot of wrong turns.One thing that is an obvious criticism is that about half the film's script is people shouting each others' names. It gets tiresome.Then, there's the obvious problem: the idea is interesting, but how do you move past it and turn it into a whole film? The mystical rock and the church of the rock imply some background lore, but the church is criminally ignored in the film, while the rock turns into an over-symbolic demonic thing. The film could have benefitted from trying to make sense of this maze-plot; instead of random, vague evil-ness, somewhat unnecessary visions and -oof- grass-men (I chose to ignore them), I would much prefer it if finding the way out required making sense of and understanding the labyrinthine field. More in the vein of Cube, if you will.Despite these flaws, at least In the Tall Grass is based on a rather original concept, so I rate it with some sympathy - it's not great, but keeps the interest of the viewer.",In the Tall Grass

106,MoistMovies,A non-boring slow burn with childhood imagination,8,4 October 2019,"From the really creative director of 'Cube', one of the greatest scifi films made in my opinion.
The film maker has unfortunately moved primarily into television episode directing since then, with a couple hit n miss films in-between like 'Splice' which was so-so. Nothing living upto Cube. 'In the Tall Grass' in my opinion is his second strongest film now. Shot. directed and mostly written really well, follows a creepy Stephen king story.. what more could you need?The concept of this story reminds me (and I assume anyone who grew up in rural areas) of the many types of games you would come up with when you were young with a wild imagination. Yet with the addition of horror.So many make believe games you come up with as a child, put into a adult perspective. Can be made totally horrifying because death or injury is often the end result. The one even city kids would know and love would be stepping on parts of a sidewalk without cracks or lines. Or you brake your back/die/get lost in another world.. etc.
Forests and fields were a gold mine for these types of games and this film plays to that idea perfectly.The only thing that let the film down was some writing/plot hole issues that could've been filled quite easily in my opinion. The father of the pregnant woman not calling the police when he finds the car (not a spoiler dw) could have been supernaturally excused easily, but they just don't address it at all.
Some of the dialogue was kinda 'meh', but mostly it was good enough for this type of film.I really like films that don't fit in a stereotype of what most movies post 2010 have become. I think around that year the decline really began with original film makers. Probably earlier. But it's become very noticeable now.
It's worth trying films like this out and giving them a fair opinion, not steeped in cynicism. On a off day where the current world is bringing me down to much, I could've given this a standard 6/10. But that would be a mistake and not giving credit towards the successfully accomplished vision of the director for a story such as 'In the tall grass' .
Please give this movie a shot. Especially if you're sick and tired of most of the generic toeing the safe ground story writing type films.

109,metalrage666,This is what happens when you don't mow the lawn.,5,20 October 2019,"A brother and sister, Becky and Cal are travelling to San Diego to meet a couple interested in adopting Becky's unborn child. Feeling a bit car-sick, they stop alongside a field of tall grass opposite an abandoned church.
Soon after they stop they hear a young boy, Tobin, calling for help as he and his family are lost in the grass.
Venturing in, Becky and Cal quickly become disoriented and lose sight of each other. After a while both become more and more separated as the field seems to distort time and distance.
A while later Becky's partner, Travis is following them in his car and once he spots the car belonging to Cal parked in front of the church, along with several other abandoned cars, he pulls over and he walks in. Travis also finds that the field distorts time as he tries to keep the sun in front of him, but suddenly finds it behind him, indicating that he's lost as well. Travis meets up with Tobin and not long after stumbles across Becky and Cal.
Travis tells them that they've been missing for 2 months, but only a few hours from their perspective.
Travis puts Tobin on his shoulders so they can try and see a way out and they make for another abandoned building that was spotted. Along the way they come across Tobin's father, Ross.
Ross lures them to a stone monolith covered in strange pictographs half buried in a clearing and pressures the others into making contact with it so they can ""understand"" the grass and why they're all here.
Natalie, Ross' wife shows up and tells them not to listen to Ross and informs them she found Becky's desiccated corpse.
Ross kills Natalie by crushing her skull and the others race to the building they saw earlier which turns out to be an abandoned bowling alley. From the roof they can see they're not too far from the road.
Ross breaks in and once they all run off into the grass they become lost again.
The next day, an earlier version of Ross, Natalie and Tobin turn up at the church and hear Travis calling out. They then enter the grass and it's clear that everybody is in some kind of time loop. Travis realises the only way to break the loop is to touch the monolith. Once he does he locates Tobin and leads him out of the grass and into the church with instructions to keep the next newly arrived versions of Becky and Cal from entering the grass.
Tobin succeeds and this version of Becky changes her mind about her baby and decides to keep it. Travis then dies on his own amidst a number of other bodies in various stages of decay.This isn't a great film or anything particularly new but it's interesting enough to keep you watching right up to the end. The only real issue I have with this is that there doesn't appear to be any real explanation for why any of this is happening. I thought that once we ended up inside the old church, it may reveal some answers but no. We don't learn if the monolith is alien origin or a left over relic from ancient indigenous tribes. It clearly has powers but again it's not really revealed as to what they are or their purpose, so for me it was kind of a let down. It's not a bad story, I just wished it was a bit more polished and not with a ""left to your own imagination"" type of ending.",In the Tall Grass

122,pal05052003,A horror story about getting lost that is saved by Patrick Wilson's presence,6,31 October 2019,"A pair of siblings hear a call for help in a field of tall grass, and venture to help, only to know they may never get out. While getting lost in the forest can be scary, it is a challenge to make a scary movie about getting lost. So I was curious as to how this movie would turn out. I was impressed by the acting, though. Patrick Wilson, who plays a father searching for his family in the grass, steals the show every time he is onscreen. Now he is like the horror go-to guy because he is so believable as the average dude caught in supernatural situations. Another captivating performance is from Will Buie Jr, who plays the lost child and the pivotal character of the story. He can be both creepy and vulnerable. How he is able to switch from creepy to vulnerable and vice versa is a mark of his acting talent. While the first act involves getting lost, and slowing realizing how helpless the characters are, the story devolves into a love triangle story, where two competing male characters try to kill each other for the female protagonist. It is not exactly like that, but that is the gist of the story. The conflict between the brother and his sister's boyfriend helps drive the dynamic of the story but completely changes the tone set in the beginning of the movie. It is Patrick Wilson and Buie Jr, who pull the focus back on the story. Though it may not be the best horror, it is enjoyable. Some shots of the moving grass are creepy, but you really need to see for yourself to know what the movie is like. If you are a horror fan, you may like it.",In the Tall Grass
123,cappiethadog,Child of the tall grass,5,3 March 2021,"""Help me,"" a boy cries, from the tall grass. What do you do?Nothing scary can happen to you in daylight. The monsters only come out at night. That's what Alfred Hitchcock disproved in his 1959 classic film ""North by Northwest"", when Cary Grant, playing a New York ad executive, finds himself in the middle of nowhere, corn field country, bored but safe. A crop duster looms in the background. At night, irony of ironies, the moviegoer wouldn't be able to track its progress, as the aircraft's innocuousness, after a few beats, transforms into a shark's fin, as the crop duster's sudden descent towards Roger Thornhill resembles ""Jaws"", an attack from the cerulean blue of the sky; the clouds, looking more and more like spume.The brother and sister from New Hampshire, the same as most people, wouldn't think twice about not answering the plea of a child in distress. They're in Kansas, a town with no name, the midpoint of their cross country trip to San Diego. They pull into the parking lot of the Black Rock of the Redeemer, an abandoned church. The young woman crosses this two-lane highway, inching closer and closer to the point of no return, while recognizing that something's not quite right. There's a second voice, the mother, telling the original voice, her son, to be quiet. At night(Laysla De Oliveria), an expectant single mother, would have deeper reservations about leaving the relative safety of the open road. At night, this voice could belong to a ghost, or worse, the undead, but in sunlight, she lets her guard down, as well as her older brother, Cal(Avery Whitted), fooled too by the cloudless blue sky. Soon enough, though, when it's too late, the siblings will realize that they've just walked into a field of nightmares.Becky and Cal DeMuth were referred to as the ***** Twins by their doting parents, in the short story written by Joe Hill and Stephen King, even though their children are not twins. Becky was born nineteen months before Cal. From the short story collection ""Full Throttle"", Hill writes: "" 'Becky picks up the phone and Cal says hello,' Mr. DeMuth liked to say,"" which echoes another Alfred Hitchcock film, ""Shadow of a Doubt"", starring Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Playing a niece and uncle, respectively, both the young woman and older man are named Charlie, so ""Little Charlie"" likes to think of themselves as twins. Similar to the musings of the musings of Becky and Cal's parents, the two Charlies are thought to possess the same famed intuition that twins are famous for. In separate beds in different time zones, the Philadelphia-based uncle gets the idea to send his family back west about a forthcoming visit. The niece, meanwhile, is initially taken aback, then not surprised at all, when the clerk hands her his uncle's telegram at the Santa Monica branch of Western Union, where she was going to wire him an invitation to visit. Sharing one of the same themes as ""In the Tall Grass"", the uncle, perhaps, loves Charlie a little too much, when in the Newton homestead, Uncle Charlie slips an expensive emerald ring on his niece's finger. Coincidence or not, Becky and Cal, as aforementioned, are California bound, too.Vincent Vitali's adaptation of ""In the Tall Grass"", thankfully, changes the brother/sister dynamic from a mutual love to a one-sided affinity, steeped in taboo. Travis McKean(Harrison Gilbertson), the father of Becky's unborn child, in the Hill/King short story, is involved in a bizarre love triangle. Travis breaks up with Becky via text: ""If we get married will I have to say I DO to your bro too? He's always around sitting on your bed reading skateboarding magazines."" Travis adds that she should start a family with Cal. This ambiguity about their relationship, for the screen, is cleared up at the outset. ""What do you know about women's bodies?"" little sis teases big bro, seemingly oblivious to this crush, when he gives her some unwarranted maternal advice, as they tear down the lonely highway in their secondhand Mazda, whereas in the original literary source, Hill writes: ""Of course...together...oven."" Both the Teresa Wright character and Travis know that they're both dealing with sociopaths, harboring a dark secret. Inevitably, both sociopaths want their secret to die with them. Uncle Charlies tries to throw his niece off a train. Cal, clutching Travis' hand as he dangles off the roof of a barn, plays god, and lets go. ""In the Tall Grass"", for the most park, though, doesn't aspire to be a familial psycho***** melodrama; its aim, more or less, is to be an uncomplicated genre film. For starters, ""In the Tall Grass"" reimagines ""The Shining"" in miniature, but this time, tailor-made for nihilists. Tobin(Will Buie Jr.), the boy(who cried wolf, as it turns out), the Danny Torrance surrogate, is being hunted by Ross Humboldt(Patrick Wilson), his father, appropriately enough, a real estate agent, who married a woman not half the tiger mom as Wendy Torrance(Shelly Duvall), when his father kills Natalie Humboldt(Rachel Wilson) in the tall grass that recalls the maze at the Overlook Hotel. This grass is alive, just like the topographical animals that Stanley Kubrick decided against using in his 1980 horror classic, starring Jack Nicholson. The tall grass is a neat amalgamation of anthropomorphic plant life from both, the Stephen King novel and Kubrick's film adaptation.Interesting first shot; it's a God's eye view of the unsolvable verdant labyrinth. suggesting a POV shot from the crop duster's pilot in ""North by Northwest"". The agricultural aircraft forces Cary Grant to seek temporary refuge in a field of corn, the same crop Ray Kinsella(Kevin Costner), a farmer, who hears a voice(just like Becky and Cal) that propels the farmer into action, ploughing his maize for the sake of a dislocated baseball field. Not coincidentally, Becky and Cal DeMuth, both, walk like early-20th century ballplayers, the eight Chicago White Sox teammates accused of throwing the 1919 World Series, portrayed in Phil Alden Robinson's ""Field of Dreams"", based on the W.P. Kinsella novel ""Shoeless Joe"". Cal backs up into the tall grass like Buck Weaver(Mike Mihoan), the third baseman who cries: ""I'm melting! I'm melting!"" Becky, on the other hand, enters the field, uncannily, in the same manner as ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson(Ray Liotta), with a comportment that telegraphs inner strength, because unlike her older brother, she's facing forwards. The visual resemblance to ""Field of Dreams"" is no accident. The filmmaker cuts from the Joe Hill and Stephen King short story, a key flashback, crucial to understanding the expectant mother's hesitancy to keep the baby, rather than give the child up for adoption. When Travis calls it quits by way of text-message, Becky, at that moment, staring at her phone aghast, loses her ward, a major fail if you're babysitting. Becky get into the Mazda and scours her neighborhood before the burnt orange clouds of dusk give way to the moon and stars, an onyx cloak for lost children. Hill writes: ""When she drove past the baseball field a second time, the players had all gone home."" There's not black rock in the farmer's cornfield, but rather, a ""Black Sox"", the ghost of Shoeless Joe who emerges from the auburn terrain to ask his patron to throw him BP. Joe is a benevolent spirit, as well as his teammates, and the opposing ballplayers from Detroit. The moviegoer knows it's the Tigers because Shoeless Joe tells the farmer that he didn't offer Ty Cobb an invite. Cobb, perhaps, a man of corn, poses a potential risk to the writer's safety. Does Terrence Mann(James Earl Jones), whom Joe invited, ever make it back out alive?""Shadow of a Doubt"", according to most film scholars, was a foundational inspiration for David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"". Under the black rock, we see human sacrifices fighting against each other, like super-sized insects. They're the congregants of the Black Rock of the Redeemer. In ""Blue Velvet"", it's a well-manicured lawn, not a field of tall grass, where we see bugs devouring each other below the verdant surface.Lumberton has its secrets.The black crow knows what the robin knows.Becky knows.Cal knows.Travis knows.So does Jeffrey Beaumont(Kyle McLachlan), when he discovers Dorothy Valens(Isabella Rossellini) in the dark side of town.And in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", so does Charlotte Newton(Young Charlie), when Uncle Charlie takes her to a dive bar in the seedier side of Santa Monica.This is what they know.No matter how high you jump, you can't see the forest for the trees.",In the Tall Grass

Family A (mother, father and kid) is already in the field and can never find it's way back, because when you enter, you can never leave. This field has some sort of possibility to transport you wherever in the field it wants. Then family B (brother and pregnant sister) stops near the field and hears family A shout, mainly the kid, so they also enter the field to rescue them. The there follows a 1,5h running in the field with some weird timeshift where sometimes family A enters the field with family B inside, at a given time the boyfriend of the pregnant sister enters the field to see her dead, but a moment later she is alive.

Seemingly some of the people touched the rock. Ross did it and he already seemed like an unethical guy and he went on a killing spree. Seemingly the boy touched it and he was supposed to not come out of there but still he escaped. Travis touched it but it had a different effect on him. He didnt go devious like Ross perhaps because he realized his mistake of abandoning his unborn child. So the rock had different effects on different people depending upon their course of actions.

149,FixedYourEnding,A Hot Mess,5,14 November 2019,"There are very few good adaptations to King's novels (Pet Semetary, Stand by me to name a couple) but many others just don't transfer well to the big screen. This one included. Nothing in particular wrong with it, it just falls flat as being stretched longer than it should, unclear storyline, overuse of dark scenes and it becoming little boring at times. Unlike ""Stand by me"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"" which are short stories that were very successfully stretched to a full-length movie, ""In the Tall Grass"" is a novella that feels too empty for a 90 minutes feature. Even making things up like ""grass people"" (which are not in the original novel) does not help to stretch the story or give it any more meaningful sense. One of the few saving graces of this movie are fairy strong acting, considering this is a horror movie and the wonderful Laysla De Oliveria (as Becky). She definitely puts the 'hot' in this hot mess.
People will question what the ending is about, however it becomes a moot point when you realize the lack of character development makes you indifferent to who lives, dies, or why. Unfortunately at the end you are in 'whatever' land. When so many things happen you don't have any solid ground to stand on, it is possible that the novel need to be simplified to make it into a good thriller vs trying to complicate it even further.
If you are on Netflix and looking for something to watch this might be a OK choice, I will personally watch anything with the name Stephen King attached to it, but this is unfortunately not one of the best adaptations.
If you like this movie genre I would strongly recommend you check out ""Mother!"" (2017 film by Darren Aronofsky) having some similar elements but heavily superior story and moral and will serve as a much better use of 2 hours of your life.

The actors perform their roles
competently.It has a good plot, lack of explanationThis movie reminds me of another mystery thriller I watched over a decade ago called Triangle (you can look it up). It has a similar theme only this takes place inside a mysterious field of grass.I was confused by how the grass affected time and its passage for people on the inside and the outside. What I understood was that the people inside the tall grass were trapped in some kind of time-loop where they would keep dying again and again, with their choices mattering as to their fate. But it still doesn't explain
A few plot holes I noticed needs some explanation :1. I swear in the beginning Tobin touched the rock when he showed it to Cal. I thought you couldn't touch the rock without being stuck forever?2. Maybe not a plot hole but I wish they had repeated a cycle more than once. They warn each other about making better decisions but we only see the iteration where they make enough right decisions to escape. What about actually cycling back to the beginning or other bit?3. If there was a constant loop, why didn't Tobin stay behind to see if his family would come back through and he could stop them going in?I still like this movie but it's better before you start thinking about it too much. It's creepy in the moment and has great cinematography. The characters leave a lot to be desired though.",In the Tall Grass

However, if you finally admit your wrongdoings and decide to change that the rock is giving you another chance and a way out , for ross he was a lier ! That's why when he touched the rock he was corrupted, he was trying to sell lies and tell them that by touching the rock you will be redeemed! Tobin touched the rock but nothing happened to him because he is a child and didn't have any sins !! Travis touched it but because he admit that he was wrong about leaving becky and that he was a jerk by doing that the rock gave him a chance to save becky and his own son , this means that travis was able to break the loop , as a result becky changed her mind about giving her child to that family and decided to go back and not go into the grass , this means also that travis doesn't have to come to look for them in the first place because they are not lost ( the loop is broken ) and becky and travis will be together again and maybe live together!",In the Tall Grass

Netflix's horror shows/movies have been pretty much hit or miss with the latter being more frequent of late.We are introduced to two characters whom we soon learn are brother and sister. The sister being pregnant and experiencing morning sickness asks the brother who is driving the car to stop so that she can be sick on the side of the road. The only building nearby is an old abandoned church which is surrounded by a field of very tall grass as far as the eye can see. The two hear a boy's voice coming from the field begging for assistance and they soon learn that the boy is lost within the field and needs help to find his way out. So without a second thought the car is abandoned next to the church and brother and sister rushes into the field to save the boy.The first 15 minutes has a very Jeepers Creepers kind of feel, US MidWest brother and sister on a road trip and no other person in sight. Up until this point the acting is solid and the story is compelling pulling the viewer into the story.It is at the point where Patrick Wilson makes his entrance that the story slowly starts to unravel and it had me scratching my head a few times trying to figure out what exactly is happening. Even with pretty solid acting all the way through, the storyline is so poorly crafted and the viewer left with so many questions that this movie simply cannot be recommended to discerning horror connoisseurs. The director attempts some ""fancy"" camera techniques and CGI shots throughout but this just further adds to the disjointed feel of the movie.Sadly this is another King adaptation that fails miserably.",In the Tall Grass

196,sjalkarjadottir,a good movie ruined by key tropes,6,13 October 2019,"The movie itself is alright. Not the most innovative one .. but the claustrophobic environment supports the chronological scenes with raised stakes in terms of shock and terror. .. It is similar to walking through a labyrinth or one of those infinite mansions with too many rooms.What did ruin it for me were the unrealistically stupid communication tropes of the protagonists. So the protagonists have a car .. which they can stand on. They enter the ""field"" because they want to assist someone to get out .. who seems confused - but appears to be close enough for clear communication. So why not stand on your car for a perfect overview and tell the person to jump to make their own way out?Makes no sense for them to just walk onto what can only be assumed to be private property.But then ... there would not be a story (in most suspense/horror movies) - if protagonists acted reasonable with a clear head. So despite the initial idiocy of their decision making and poor communication skills that sometimes hardly extend beyond ""the pronoun game"" (for a married couple, they really dont communicate well at all) - it is a run-of-the-mill average .. but watchable movie. Not a waste of time but certainly not a classic",In the Tall Grass

208,sheldonnylander,A Stephen King Work That Doesn't Take Place in Maine?,4,8 October 2019,"""In the Tall Grass"" is a Netflix film based on a short story/novella written by Stephen King and his son Joe Hill. A little disclosure that I have not read the original story, so I can't attest as to how faithful this film is, so I'll be looking at the movie on its own merits, as few as they may be.We start with two siblings, Cal and a pregnant Becky who are travelling through Kansas (a plus here is that we have a story from Stephen King that does not take place in Maine) when they pull over to the side of the road when Becky gets morning sickness and they hear a boy calling for help from the tall grass field on the side of the road. They get separated from each other and realize that something weird is going on, that travelling in one direction doesn't necessarily mean travelling in that direction and time is out of joint. Others that they meet in the field are Ross, played by Patrick Wilson, his son Tobin, his wife Natalie, and Lisa's ex-boyfriend Travis.Alright, so as more disclosure here, I filled in the names of these characters after looking them up. I honestly could not remember their names, that's how much of an impression they left on me, with the possible exception of the boy because when we first see him he comes off really creepy. I mean, really, it's not so much that you want any characters to die because they're irritating. They're just so cookie-cutter and stereotypical that they leave little to no lasting impression.Another reason for this is that the audience can be a little too distracted by the grass itself. It does have a certain character to it, even if it's nearly impossible to figure out. But I found myself distracted trying to figure out the grass, how it works, its motivations, at the expense of the human characters.And here is where we run into another problem. Because most of the set looks the same, that being in the middle of a tall grass field, the filmmakers need to rely on a series of technical and visual gimmicks to keep the audience interested and focused. But they're inconsistent and stand out when they use them (for example, one consistent shot that is a 360 degree rotation). They don't feel natural. You see the gimmick instead of what the gimmick is trying to show you, although that's arguable as they're clearly proud of some of these visual effects. In addition, this being a horror movie, there are going to be jump scares, but jump scares are just about all there is for this horror movie.The conclusion is pretty meh and isn't really consistent with other parts of the movie from what we learn plotwise. All around, if you're really a Stephen King or Joe Hill fan and have nothing else to watch, go ahead, but for most people I would say not to bother.",In the Tall Grass

So I'm still kind of surprised that I indeed did like this movie! A LOT of plot holes and things unexplained, random stuff that kind of went nowhere, but I enjoyed myself. Child actor was good.And to everyone thinking they should have been able to find their way out by looking over the grass, that was explained and actually shown in the movie. Tobin on Travis's shoulders, for one. Becky and Cal jumping up to find each other.
And if I heard a young boy crying for help, I don't know if I could keep from not going in, as scary as it looked. I would figure I could surely find my way out. Plus, I believe the rock was sort of luring people in, don't you?And Travis went in because Becky had been missing for 2 months, presumed dead, so he was willing to take longshots when he saw her book on the side of the road. I'm sure he expected to find her dead inside, but at least there would be some closure.
Oh, the brother-sister relationship was unnecessarily a little weird. Made me a bit uncomfortable at times. They could have definitely handled that differently, unless they were actually going for Cal wanting Becky ""in that way."" Ew. Even though Travis confronts Cal that Cal is just scared to be left behind, it still doesn't account for his creepy demeanor and drastic measures.

237,screenotes,King on Grass,3,26 October 2019,"I think Stephen King really hates mowing lawns. He has managed to find horror in the lawnmower itself in The Lawnmower Man (1992), King appeared as a half man / half grass monster in Creepshow (1982) and most recently has had Netflix adapt his novella In The Tall Grass (2019). While Sunday garden maintenance can unnerve even the most stoic, it is a unique mind which can envisage a cast of characters getting lost in tall grass to horrific ends. Still, after so many decades of writing horror fiction, not all ideas can be as inherently creepy as killer clowns lurking in sewers.Having not read the novella and very quickly realising that the plot of the film indeed is contained within the title, my first question was how a 1 hour 48 feature film could be teased out of such a basic premise. The answer to this question quickly becomes less important than the question, why bother?A number of Stephen King staples such as family man turned rapist, incestuous overtones and dead dogs pervade a concentric mess of a story while the backdrop of just about every scene is (unsurprisingly) grass. Supernatural elements are introduced to advance plot points without adherence to any kind of internal logic, omitting a basic tenet of horror which made films like the Director's own cult classic, Cube (1997) such a success.The fact that the film is so visually boring is surely only partially the fault of Director Vincenzo Natalie. Lets face it, he didn't have much to work with from the screenplay. However, the complete lack of any tension is surely within his remit and not helped by the unceasing and unsubtle score.The answer to the question ""why bother"" is the same as the answer to the question of why there are so many recent Stephen King adaptations. It's the same as the answer to the question of why there are so many Tom Clancy adaptations, why there are so many Marvel and DC adaptations and why the concept of an ""unfilmable"" novel is now just a marketing tool.Dependability of an inbuilt audience has been a boon to risk-averse studios in the modern era and the bane of filmgoers who long for the lost age of mid-budget, original gems such as the aforementioned Cube. This dependability is in fact the seductive siren lure of mediocrity in opposition to which Netflix itself has been a beacon.",In the Tall Grass

250,Markyajv,Not what the low reviewers are saying it is.,7,28 October 2019,"First let me start out by saying that the low reviews on here that are saying that all you're going to hear or see in this movie are people calling out each other's names and not being able to find each other in a huge plot of long grass is 100% false! This movie is more of a supernatural Thriller in my opinion. If I had listened to the low reviewers I wouldn't have watched it and I almost turned it off because the beginning does start out that way, but what movie were people get lost in the woods doesn't start out that way?, but it goes in a completely different direction. The movie does not take place completely in the grass. That is not a spoiler. My take on reviewers is they like what they like and you like what you like and if you like it then that's great and if you don't like it then that's great but don't come on here and say that you watched something and it was one thing when it wasn't what you said it was that just came off to me as you didn't watch the entire film. Another thing that kind of gave me what might be deja vu is that this reminded me of a movie I have already seen problem is I can't remember the name of it but I remember watching a movie years ago where people were stuck in a field and they were trying to find each other and they would come out on one end and see their friends like down the road and they go back into the field.... Did anybody else have that feeling? Anyway give it a watch it was kind of cool wasn't the best movie in the world of course definitely wasn't a 10 out of 10 and it definitely wasn't a 1 out of 10.

Now because of this, let me know any differences about the novella; as for the movie, it was good. But for me there were a few flaws.
Here are positives first: acting, good. Casting choice, gotta love Patrick Wilson. A nice uneasiness in the first act.
Cons: the plot, what's going on? Don't get me wrong, I like mystery. A little vagueness makes me happy, but this felt a little overwhelming. The elements are cool, but man is there so much to take in. A woman having a baby, grass that can talk, okay. Time travel? Alien rock? Grass people? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down a bit! Need to play catch up, man!
Second, where's the tension by act 2? First 2 acts in my opinion should have unease; then the 3rd can have the final battle?

It's trippy and pretty original (if nonsensical), with some creepy sound design and the occasional weird set-piece.That said, it slightly overstayed its welcome.

Then they hear a cry of help from a boy in the fields and decided to put their noses in and help. And now they're lost.And in the fields where time is of no essence, a bunch of nosy people start getting lost and apparently die. There's a possessed father who killed his wife, a kid who lures them all in, and that weird rock that seem to consume everybody. Oh my goodness.One of my favorite parts though was when the brother and sister asked each other to jump to see where they both were. They jumped one first time and they were within an arm's reach but when they jumped a second time, they were like moving so fast away from each other. WTF?? Now that was creepy.At the end of the movie, i was still at a loss. And then I remembered how the hype was with Bird Box.

The acting was well done by the whole cast, they were all very committed to their performances, and the cinematography and special effects were pretty good as well. That's it. The rest of the movie was bad. The film has a plot similar to movies like Edge of Tomorrow and Groundhog Day, the characters are stuck in an endless time loop, and they have to figure out how to get out of it. It takes quite a while for the viewer figure this out because the storytelling is so poorly done, so you do not really understand what is going on for the first half of the movie. The film doesn't really explain anything to you either, you are just kind of expected to figure everything out for yourself. By the end of the movie you are left with a lot of questions, and very few answers. On top of all of this confusion, the film lacks any scares, which is usually something that you would expect to see in a horror movie.

There are probably several lessons to be gleaned from this film if one exerts enough attention to get through it, but sadly I lost interest halfway through.It's not the worst horror I've seen (and trust me - there are truly terrible horror movies out there) but it suffers from a general lack of variety. By the end it sort of feels like you watched the exact same scene play out about fifty times.I'm probably not the only one, but one of my biggest turnoffs with horror films is when they are filmed almost entirely in the dark.

Light on plot, sure, but that's not the point. There's a single POINT of plot and everything else is only there to frame it and illustrate it. King thrives in a terrible sense of wrong. Disjointed, twisted, tied-in-knots, all of it ...wrong-but-real. Especially in the short-stories and novellas, King hyper-focuses on a POINT of something terrible and wraps detail around it.Some adaptations are better than others. This one is really not bad. It's pretty good. The sense of wrong is prevalent, but not insistent. I love the concept of knotted, non-linear time. But even that isn't all of it. (And if you want to look, there ARE sub-plots in the relationships between the characters. But they aren't the point!)I'm a country-boy. I grew up in farm country. And not even truly LARGE farms, by national standards! As a kid with wide freedom to roam, (free-range, as they say) there was a fear, a wariness of things like the wide corn fields. They are so huge, so endless. Half-way through you start to wonder if you are lost, how you might get out; the doubts begin to creep-in and fear takes root. Things turn sinister as the leaves of the corn give you sharp, paper-cut-like pain, drawing blood as you run through it. ...And that's in the day-time. Try it at night... and the Unknown can grow to fill the edges of the whole world. I know it. I loved it. And I carried a cheap samurai sword everytime I went out to the woods or the fields after dark.There's some of that in this movie. And with an actor that makes a really good bad-guy. And special effects that do very well to portray a terrible, amorphous, unnameable concept.This is a well done move.

Weird is certainly King's game, at the top of each story, regardless of which one... That's the secret formula for him - he gets you to a place where events just get creepy, and nothing has to be explained. Then, you kind of believe whatever is happening actually could be possible in that world. That's why all the slow character/plot building elements work so great with an unexplainable reality. Now, there, are some downfalls for how it was done. With a little more money to the budget, and maybe a stronger cast, it could have been a lot more hard hitting. Overall, great psychological thriller that keeps you questioning fantasy against reality for characters you end up actually caring about.",In the Tall Grass

For those that watched this thinking what the hell did i watch, i'm so confused, the best i can offer is this.The grass is in front of the church, thus the grass is pergatory, the rock is the is the judge of who is a sinner and who is not. The grass is punishing you for your sins, and then only releasing those that pass its judgement.By travis admitting his sins he was granted a second chance at life and saved along with those he loved. Tobin is either an innocent and was spared, or he was kept there also after being judged by the stone as his parents talk about how he is badly behaved early on. The church is where those that absolve their sins are sent to move on. Tobin's dad continued to sin whilst being judged, and is doomed to live in pergatory. Animals arent supposed to have souls in some religions, and thus couldn't leave. Tobin's mum isnt explained but i assume she too failed the sinning test since she also can't leave. The tree people are tortured souls unable to move on due to continued sin, and are driven mad from eating grass seeds for sustainance. Becky is forced to eat her child as punishment for considering aborting it and having it out of wedlock.The cars at the church of the cars of those that didnt past the test in the field saying this has been happening for ages and is unstoppable. The dude crushing his wife's head?!! No idea, Im guessing perhaps a glimmer of the suffering that will await you if you are judged to be evil?
The phone call to herself was to show her you can't change fate, this has been planned all along and is not stoppable.

Never have 6 characters felt like far too many to keep track of, even when some of these characters are more footnotes than anything.The more you get immersed into this story, the more disjointed it seems. So much is happening in the grass, so many characters dying again and again, that it becomes hard to determine which parts matter, and which parts are inconsequential. Eventually, the bulk of the film feels more like filler than real content, with random horrors thrown in (head crushing, incest vibes, baby eating, etc.) to fill a run time rather than give meaning to this cumbersome affair.Quite often, the film seems like its trying to school you, but none of the lessons hit home in a particularly strong manner. Abortion is discouraged (but so is adoption?), incest is danced around as heinous but ultimately survives the story (a reminder to those that Cal is the pregnant girl's brother, not boyfriend), and religion is a weird and powerfully dangerous thing, and enlightenment is not meant for mere mortals.Stay off the grass, kids.

There's nothing here worth watching unless tall grass, lost people (in more ways than one), a lot of screaming, boring characters, and garbled themes of personal choice, responsibility, redemption and evil are your thing, and you crave a story with no point and worse denouement.Here's the plot, such as it is. A young pregnant woman and her brother, driving to San Diego, stop by a field of tall grass because she has a bout of nausea. While stopped they hear a child calling for help from the grass. Instead of calling 911 and staying put as any sensible person would, they walk into the grass, which is over their heads, to rescue the child, and are soon lost themselves. The first 15 minutes are fairly intriguing, but it rapidly deteriorates into ....well, a field of grass, calling one another's names, time shifts, and confusion.It occurs to me that Stephen King may have had his tongue in his cheek, writing about ""grass"" and getting lost in it, unable to find a way out. Or maybe he was quite seriously using ""grass"" as a metaphor for making bad choices (like everyone who goes into the field), and then being literally ""lost"". Or not.

366,DVDExotica,Not As Dumb As You'd Think!,5,4 February 2020,"I went into this expecting something much hokier and dumber. I didn't realize at the time that this was an adaptation of a Stephen King/ Joe Hill novella, and I'm not sure now whether knowing that would've raised or lowered my expectations.So the premise is appealing simple. A young, traveling brother and sister pull over at a church along the side of a highway and hear a young boy calling for help from a field of, you guessed it, tall grass. They walk in and become lost because the field is somehow supernatural and traps everybody who wanders into it, so they've got to solve the mystery (or not) and escape. We quickly realize time travel involved, spoiling the simplicity and basically turning this into a rehash of that last Blair Witch movie.I was ready for something super dumb and unwittingly campy along the lines of The Happening or Bird Box, but this is actually smarter and better played than anything along those lines. Which isn't to say that this isn't dumb at all... At one point, our heroes figure out an effective way to thwart and navigate the field, and then just decide to stop doing it for no apparent reason at all. Maybe there was initially supposed to be a scene that showed their technique failing, but it got cut for some reason? I don't know, but it's weird. And some dialogue choices make no sense, like when the characters shout out to each other to follow each other's voices right in the beginning of the film. So the sister shouts out x-rated limericks, even though they're there to help a small boy who's intently listening as well. Who would randomly decide to start shouting sex stuff to a young child in need of rescue? I'm guessing this is something from the novella that stopped making sense after script changes, but they weren't prepared to overhaul the whole script to fix it? Maybe? Who knows?But these are nitpicks. Just little dumb things in a film that feels like it should be full of big dumb things, but isn't. Unfortunately, whether that helps or hurts is debatable. Because once time travel enters the story (which again, is pretty early on... no spoilers here) and dead characters become alive again, the stakes disappear. So this film no longer has the power to be scary or suspenseful. It's just a convoluted sci-fi sort of plot, like a Twilight Zone that had to be heavily padded and stretched out to reach feature length. So, if this film can't offer thrills or excitement, laughs might be the next best thing. But this film isn't dumb enough for those, leaving In the Tall Grass in an unsatisfying sort of limbo.Other issues:As you might guess, this film couldn't really sustain grass being the frightening villain for the full hundred minutes, so they have a random guy go crazy and evil (again not really a spoiler, this happens well within the first half of the film), which turns their intriguing premise into something much more generic and predictable. Other decisions, like including an abandoned bowling alley location presumably because the director was sick of staging all the action in a patch of grass, also just serve to undercut the ominous nature of the field.This film is trying to communicate a message, obviously, but it's seriously muddled. Everybody stops at a church, there's a magic rock that gives people visions, our two leads can't stop talking about their backstory of the sister being pregnant and planning to give her baby up for adoption. They're all lost in the grass and every decision they make seems judged by this omnipotent field... It's obviously all a big, heavy-handed metaphor. But whatever moral or point they're trying to get across... just doesn't. You have to second-guess the authors to even have an inkling. Would the Kings say the church is salvation, or do they think it's a corruptive influence? Just how feminist are they - are they supporting or condemning a woman's decision to not keep her baby? Knowing them well enough to answer those questions (and I don't feel like I do) would help you better understand the film. But the film itself doesn't give you enough to figure out what it's trying to say, let alone move you in anyway by whatever argument it's making.It's also worth pointing out that the film seems to have made some major changes from the novella, including the ending. Two sets of authors pulling in different directions probably explains the muddled and mixed messaging.And if you just stubbornly decide to ignore all subtext and only look at this film's superficial plot, the logic doesn't hold up. For example, characters like to repeatedly point out ""this field doesn't move dead things, so they're easier to find."" But because the field keeps moving YOU, having a steady marker laying somewhere out there wouldn't help you anyway, because your position and proximity to it is always randomized. Of course, at this point you could say I'm over-thinking the movie. But this is a movie that BEGS you to think about the mystery and puzzle it out. You're clearly supposed to be caught up in the dangling questions ""what would I do to escape?"" and ""what does this latest, strange development signify?"" If it doesn't signify anything, or your method would sometimes work and sometimes not because the writers couldn't make their own ideas stick to a consistent logic, then you're left feeling like you've wasted your time caring.So, I don't know. I enjoyed the watch, but I can't argue that it's an effective movie. Not smart enough to recommend as a truly engaging film anybody would be really impressed with, but not dumb enough to sit back and laugh at. It just kind of sits in the middle, which might make it sound like an absolute must-skip. But actually, I found it strangely compelling. I'll probably even watch it again at some point.",In the Tall Grass

The movie does reveal, between the lines with subtle clues what is happening and this is where it lacks. At some points it could have been presented a little clearer with still a mysterious spooky atmosphere. Also the creep factor at points came across a little cheesy and some of the acting could have been better.

The film is one that I could only compare with 'goosebumps' TV series based on the R.L. Stine books, deliberately silly.The film gets off to a good start. Initially I was quite drawn. After that first act we see some what of a decline.With every twist comes a turn which causes the film to escape the audience.The story line of a forbidden relationship between dead beat young man and a underachieving woman trying to solve their problems amidst the background noise of a disapproving family member is one I'm pretty sure we have seen since Shakespearean times.Visually there is something about the film off putting that I can not put my finger on. Perhaps it is another case of Netflix's poor delivery of their original projects.Although my criticism may be harsh I still enjoyed the film.

So help they do and end up getting stuck in the tall grass. Later on other characters experience the same fate.

Yes, it's well photographed and edited; the acting is at par with what it should be but there is no sense of heart palpitating terror here and that becomes a problem for a horror film.

I ended up engrossed in the film and watched it all the way to the end feeling rather involved in the story. I see a lot of people complaining about how the characters made bad decisions. This is a horror film people, horror wouldn't exist if it weren't for people making bad decisions. If characters did the smart thing in any horror film it would be about 5 minutes long.

Unfortunately these 100 minutes here were quite disappointing, and at times, boring.
Good: The setting was great. Endless high grass, although obviously CGI, it looks good. What's going on here? Really strange stuff. You want to see what happens next. First 30 minutes are good.
But - and now the bad: Nothing happens. Or: For a long time not much happens. And then the movie switches to a very dark setting at night, you almost don't see anything, all the pictures are so dark that you almost don't see for at least 30 minutes what's going on. Who has been hit? Is someone dead? Was that a rock or a tree? Imagine it.Also, I'm pretty sure that they changed the ending so it looks more bright for Hollywood (need to re-read if I'm right).Bottom line: Read the short story - perfect as it is, good as a short horror story - avoid the film adaption which is too long for what the short story gives you, and they changed too much to make it more appealing to mainstream audiences.",In the Tall Grass

Filmmakers want to ride the Stephen King novels, but there's better out there. Much better. His stories starts out with a bang, but then gradually becomes too fantastical and towards the end, drops the ball for the conclusion. This has become the theme of Stephen King novels since The Shining.The Shining was well made because it was directed by one of the greatest directors of our time, Stanley Kubrick.

416,DmytroBaker,Don't trust the voices.,5,3 November 2019,"An endless field of tall grass (the name of the plant is unknown), the voice of a child who has become entangled in the thickets, two adults who decided to help the boy and the ominous rustle of leaves, as a harbinger of mystical and frightening events in this vast ocean of greenery.When pregnant Becky and her brother Cal are braking on the side of the road opposite this field, they hear a cry for help from a boy who has lost his way in the thicket. Going to the rescue, brother and sister realized that not only the boy became a «hostage» of the thicket - it was so easy not to get out of the field.Reading the description, and then watching the film, I could not drive away the thought from myself: «why you can't go all the time in one direction - the field will end sooner or later, you will go on the road, and there you can get help from the travelers»? If you assess the situation soberly, the situation in which the characters find themselves becomes critical because of themselves, because the heroes panic and begin to cut circles, stomping on the spot and wandering in the ""three pines"". Although there is no need to discount the demonic nature of the field itself.A short film would have come out of the story from which the film was made (it was written by Stephen King and his son), since watching an endless walk in the grass for an hour and a half is boring despite the fact that additional locations appear in the film from time to time (for example, old bowling club). On the screen, the film's characters flicker among the thickets, which makes the potential horror movie more like a family picture, where the characters run after each other, playing catch-up. The endless shouting of the names of the lost, which stick in the field like blind kittens from side to side, is quite tedious. Probably, a third of all the dialogues just occupy the names that sound above the green infinity.The extremely inexpressive game of the cast (only Patrick Wilson is known of the whole mass), combined with nondescript computer graphics and plot holes, make «In the Tall Grass» a fairly average film product. He has interesting ideas - after all, an ominous field with voices that either really ask for help, or lure regular victims, but at the same time he is not able to offer the viewer anything more than an ordinary walker and the next one who went all over his head and decided that he is chosen/sacred/unique.The director of the film, Vincenzo Natalie, noted that he had expanded the participation of the character of Travis, the pair of the main character, as he saw in him a comparison with Orpheus, who was looking for his Eurydice. For that matter, and the director decided to turn to ancient Greek mythology and compared the green field with the Underworld, where Orpheus went down in search of Eurydice, why not draw an analogy with the myth and imagine the field as something metaphysical, beyond reality and having a lot of dangers and ambiguities for ordinary people who would have to face their fears, and better with the fears of others. From this, the effect of the shock of the heroes would be much stronger...Not all King's creations turn out to be of high quality, but if you pay attention to the writer's work, you can understand that he is capable of turning anyone into a frightening and chilling soul. It would seem an ordinary field, but with King it turns into a field of fear and death.Watching movies, I never cease to be surprised at the stupidity of some heroes. In some paintings, they can sleep on bare ground next to a pond in the autumn (hello to the kidneys!), And in «In the Tall Grass» some people sleep in the field on wet ground, which is natural dirt. Obviously, the guy was extremely stupid, because he did not even think of breaking green stems and lying on a makeshift flooring! It's so simple and obvious! Why can't you think of this ?!In any case, I do not impose my opinion on you. You can evaluate the film yourself.Enjoy watching.",In the Tall Grass

The film starts good enough with a slight 'creepshow' vibe to it where a brother and sister stop in there car and are lured into the tall grass after hearing a child shouting for help.... But strangely the film takes a more strange plot choice course of action when a giant rock appears to be at the root cause with no real explanation except with sacrafise and maybe cult type activity (children of the corn) it then moved onto where the field appeared to 'shift' and the survivors die and reappear in a another part of the field (the cube) unaware they died etc...

""In The Tall Grass"" shows where Stephen King shines best. Cosmic Horror, or Lovecraftian horror as they say. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat because it creates an intriguing world that invites you to put efforts into grasping it. However you will never find all answers. That might upset some people, but if you are into cosmic horror, you might like this one.The movie does not provide jump scares. Instead the cinematography is placed on the foreground. The field feels tranquil, haunting and claustrophobic. It makes things feel eerie while also creating a sense of wonder. Luckily, the movie is not afraid to go to a few unexpected places and reveal some of it's mysteries without revealing to much and making you lose that fear of the unknown. The acting is decent and the characters, though not extremely lovable, are not of-putting either.It isn't without flaws of course. Some characters have a few familiar horror tropes tied to them, which makes them act in in an exaggerated way, making frustrating choices or jut making it all a little less original. Also the theme of being stuck in a loop, or lost in a place that resembles some kind of purgatory, has been explored many times before. (Dead End (2003), Timecrimes (2007), Triangle (2009), just to name a few.)
That being said, it does execute the idea much better than for example ""Coherence"" from 2013 (which has a higher score on Imdb, for whatever reason.) Which had highly frustrating characters and felt quite bland i general. It makes me realize how pulling off such a story is like balancing on a rope. Give to much and it becomes silly, give to little and it becomes a blue balling disappointment.I give In The Tall Grass a well deserved 6.
(+) Great execution of cosmic horror.
(+) Good pacing
(- ) Not groundbreaking",In the Tall Grass

Basically you see a group of people wandering their way in a field of tall grass. It seems to just go on and on without any real story. People seem to die then apparently come back. On top of all of this the story, what there is of it, is very hard to follow. I love horror and while this is listed as horror I found nothing scary only annoying.

Major Positive in the movie is works of Wrobleski as the movie needs lots of grass and its sure a difficult task for him to fixing angles and camera movements inside the field though deliverd an extraordinary job for the film. Better acting from the cast especially Becky as hero and Ross as villian (Patrick Wilson) here to mention Tobin is good to watch.

Then it dawned on me the plot is the same as the movie Cube 3. Same concept of people trapped in an endless, never changing environment finding copies of themselves in different times and alternate futures.Not saying it was bad. It's still worth a watch, I just get annoyed in this day and age of ""short format"" storytelling to pad a movie like this with a large portion of ""movie mulch"" or ""cinema cereal"", a bunch of empty repetitive filler to stretch a simple concept to fill some old school 90 minute time slot.

I hate horror movies where obvious ways out of a situation are ignored solely so the story can continue but this movie truly had me waiting on the edge of my seat to see how they were going to get themselves out of this situation.

447,josh_flanagan,"Good idea, lackluster execution",5,12 October 2019,"The stomach-churning and terrifying charm of Joe Hill and Steven King's original novella did not translate well to the big screen. The fascinating premise, the ambiguity of time, and the ominous religious undertones offer a notable hook to viewers interested in a reasonable October scare. However, the unnecessary and disappointing use of CGI and the crude, cliche-ridden character backstories leave this film wanting in many of the areas most important to modern horror. Throughout the film, there is an overpowering sense of foreshadowing that obscures the actual plot at many points. Unmotivated, nonsensical character choices coupled with an uncomfortable amount of screaming, and a comedic amount of chanting make this film a relatively unpleasant narrative experience. Patrick Wilson does make a surprisingly attractive corn man, though.",In the Tall Grass

At times, it gave the impression of being the product of a sick, even psychotic, mindset, with undertones of a quasi moralistic / religious intent.

To make a normal length movie out of a short story is hard and they tried to insert somethings that aren't in the story originally, but even that didn't do the job to make it engaging.

I thought the acting was good, the plot about the rock was okay (although I wish it had been explained a little bit more, like why was this rock here? Was it a meteor? Haunted?) The ending made me wonder if Travis was going to be stuck there forever, if the kid stopped them from ever going into the field in the first place. That means Travis would never had to go looking for them which means he wouldn't have ended up there. So I wish something at the end made me think he got away also.

Total nonsense.ACTUAL STORY: The short story starts the same way, Becky and Cal try to find Tobin who was asking for help but they also get lost and can't find each other. Becky is found by Tobin's father who's offering help. He takes her to the place where he ate parts of Natalie's body then say he'll rape her on the rock, they fight, she attacks him with keys then scissors right after he kicks her in the belly which causes the miscarriage. We don't know what really happens to him next ( he's probably dead cause he screams then laughs then cries. Don't ask ). Crying Cal is found by Tobin who's eating a dead crow, he explains that they get hungry in the tall grass so they eat what they can. ( The dog, Natalie, the crow, the baby and it made sense in the story, why remove it? ) He says he'll take Cal to Becky but instead takes him to the rock. Cal can't resist and touches the rock. He finally finds Becky, delirious and nearly unconscious, feeds her with her own baby ( Tobin and Cal eat some of it too, and laugh ).

The movie does throw some 'time warp' stuff, just to make you believe that there is something going on, but fails miserably to even make a decent effort to explain what exactly the mess is about. To put it short, there is a stone at the center of a grassy field that has some mystic powers in it. It can bend the time, your past, your future, the way that everyone is lured in. It controls your mind if you touch it, and you kinda become its agent. So you would start forcing others to become a part of the giant organism.

But most importantly, I liked the point of the movie.A huge rock in the center of the tall grass which decides are you a sinner or not, it is interesting. Well, I have to agree, I put 7/10, coz I didn't like some of the scenes, the camera was shaken and it was hard to watch, and I didn't like all the shouting.I liked that field of grass is some kind of labyrinth for people, and going through it people are doing choices, by which rock decides are you a sinner or not. I liked the idea of time, it is mixed up, but it is interesting.For those crying about the bad scenario and boring movie, if you want to watch a ""good"" horror movie, with the explained scenario and easy idea, welcome to the world of cartoons, no thinking needed, everything is on the plate.",In the Tall Grass

This would have added a lot of weight to the film however the film was just let down by the plot, the acting and the sound.

All I know is that they planted a pregnant woman in the movie for no good reason, and it was agonising watching her suffer so much. There was so much crudeness for no good reason that it made me actually dislike the film.

The plot flows, acting is good, the special effects are effective as is the camerawork.Stephen King, Joe Hill and Vincenzo Natali are to thank for this one, it's based on their novella. As with two other offerings from Stephen King on Netflix ('1922' and Gerald's Game'), I found 'In The Tall Grass' to be the most interesting and enjoyable. It has hidden meanings that I won't spoil, (you can read about them on other websites,) and the characters performances were strong and well played.All 101 minutes of this flick kept me entertained and wanting more, with the surprise ending topping off a movie full of drama, mystery and horror. 'In The Tall Grass' can't be described as a horror as it falls into the category of other genres. There's some shocking scenes, subliminal messages and graphic images.So if you can put up with some repetitive scenery filmed in darkness, (as a lot of the movie is shot in), and accept that the plot may be confusing at times, then check out the movie.",In the Tall Grass

Vincenzo Natali
(Cube)A brother and his pregnant sister are making their way to California. As they drive through the country they pull off on the side of the road to take a quick break. They hear a young boy calling out for help in the tall grass and decide to help him. As they search for the boy, they get lost in the tall grass aimlessly searching for a way out. As hours go by they begin to meet new people in the grass and plan to regroup and find a way out. An ancient evil is playing tricks on them and just wants them to know the truth.Being a fan of Stephen King, I always do my best to watch his films. Now that his son is getting the film adaptation treatment, I try my best to support his work too. This is one of their novels I wasn't very familiar with, so I went in blind. Three days have passed and I'm still thinking about this little Netflix original. While the plot is simple its complex timeline makes it worth a watch. It has decent acting throughout but relies on Patrick Wilson for the most part. Some death scenes stood out to me and when I think of this movie I'll be sure to remember them. I'm not upset I didn't watch this sooner but I'm glad I finally took the time out to give it a watch.

However, the script of this is horrible, the acting is not great, and we're never really given an explanation of what's going on. It gets really bloody and disturbing, but what shocked me is a part where the woman gives birth, then the villain kills her newborn, tears it into pieces, and feeds it to her without her knowing what she's eating...

568,nloddo-09125,Religious symbols abound,7,7 October 2019,"Interesting enough, I have found very few reviews online (outside IMBD) regarding the heavy religious symbolism here. King often pits good vs. evil with religious symbolism. So, as soon as I saw the church and the rock, I looked up the biblical references.Each of the characters' names contains religious significance. The name meanings put together as follows: Christmas & God is Good (Natalie & Tobin) and Virgin to join crossroads (Virginia/Becky/Travis).Cal-check out the history of John Calvin and the Calvinist movement/protestant reformation/predestination/control over one's destiny, etc.Ross- Check out James Francis Ross, famous philosopher of, among other things, religion, including Renaissance/enlightened thought.The church & rock: Jesus built his church on the rock. Many believe Peter was the rock. There's also a bible quote about the gates of Hades not prevailing against the rock. Though we see what appears to be some sort of possible gateway to hell open beneath Becky. Also, check out the Catholic ideas about those who may create doctrine, etc, which originates with the story of Peter and the rock. All befitting since Ross keeps trying to force his beliefs upon the rest of the characters.The 2 families. Ross/Natalie/Tobin Travis/Becky/Virginia: Both mothers wearing blue like Mary in the nativity. There's even a scene when Becky gives birth and Cal is telling her about wise men bringing them gifts.Cal also feeds her the flesh of her child-like how Mary sacrificed her son/Jesus who later fed others his flesh-the host in Catholicism. Ross refers to touching the rock as being like taking in the host - almost foreshadowing this moment that resembles taking in the host - or flashing back if you consider the time loop isues. Note,in the story, it's Cal feeding her. In the film, it starts as Cal and turns out to be Ross. Both individuals whose names represent different religious philosophies.7 people in the field: Rebecca, in the Talmud and Bible, met Isaac in fields of beer sheba. Beersheba means the Well of Seven. Isaac built 7 wells in beersheba. 7 lambs sealed oath of Abraham (Isaac's father) in those fields. Also the site of religious wars.Also, couldn't help thinking about the Jewish people being lost in the desert while watching these characters constantly make the wrong choices while lost in the grass/ ""wilderness."" Also, the version of Midnight Special they sing refers to prison which can be linked to the King concepts of how being trapped and isolated can turn people into monsters but, redemption is also possible (Shawshank Redemption/Castle Rock series kind of themes).Becky: Check out Rebecca's story in the bible. There's even a moment when her husband pretends she's his sister to avoid her being taken and raped.And, of course, this reminded me of Children of the Corn, a story about a cult devoted to the blue boy, but originating with the idea of worshipping the Greek goddess Artemis (I think). The beginning of Children of the Corn has a boy coming out of the field (already dead, unbeknownst to the couple who thinks they his him). It's the boy being thrown out of the field that lures the couple into the field. Also, all the mud and the blood scenes appear reminiscent of Children of the Corn with the field being fed by the dead.Anyways, that's all I can think about for now. As for my review, if you like King and you enjoy something thought provoking,you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for a typical, shallow horror flick (which I also happen to thoroughly enjoy), this is not it. All in all, I really liked this film. But that's primarily because I believe there's a lot more than what's on the surface.",In the Tall Grass
569,nloddo-09125,Classic King,7,7 October 2019,"The conflicting reviews remind me of M. Night Shamlan issues. When people expected another Sixth Sense and instead got the Lady in the Water or The Happening. Here, it's not going to be another Pet Cemetary. It's more like The Stand but with a much simpler setting. The film has a lot of layers and symbolism. I think it's got some allegorical aspects that take it out of the realm of simple horror-which I appreciate. It also weaves in some plot devices from prior King novels, which is also pretty cool. I think the simple setting is deceptive and there's a lot more to this story if you look deeper. For those who are just looking for thrills and chills, this may seem deficient to you. But, if you are a big nerd-like me- who enjoys looking for the various possible meanings, you'll enjoy it.",In the Tall Grass

572,Mewvies,The kids not the most annoying part,4,21 October 2019,"I will say that despite not liking this moving there is some genuinely disturbing and daring imagery and themes in the movie, which i can appreciate. what i cant appreciate is a movie where nothing happens fro the bulk of the movie and once something interesting does happen it doesn't happen again for another 20 minutes. If you have Netflix enjoy horror and don't plan on canceling your subscription I would recommend this movie not because I think its good but because its there. the point of my title to this review is often bad acting is the worst part of a movie and bad child actors can often be infuriating. The worst part of this movie is its inconsistencies. SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT.The plot of the movie is that once you enter the field of tall grass you are lost in a never ending maze. Simple enough, but that alone doesn't bring us to an almost two hour run time.Once you are stuck in the maze you are also stuck in a time/ dimension loop. also there is a rock that turns you evil if you touch it, that wants you to kill for it unless it wants to have you have other people touch it, but sometimes the rock doesn't want make you evil but also sometimes it wants you to give birth to a baby. throughout the story there are six people and a dog in the movie a family of three, our characters that we start with who are a pregnant woman traveling with her brother to leave behind the woman's old life because of a break up with her baby daddy, and then the baby daddy him self. There doesn't seem to be any rime or reason of when the maze or rock or what ever force drives the events of the movie. at one point we see that a character has died numerous time as evidence by the field of dead bodies that are all that character. at one point early on in the movie it is revealed that ""the field doesn't move dead things"" So of course they use this as a way to find each other in the ever changing maze, but this wouldn't work as 1. wouldn't everyone need to know where the dead thing is in order for every one to find it. 2. just because you know where something is that doesn't mean you know the way to get to it. 3. there is a time loop so people constantly run into people in a different time loop. 4. If the dead things don't move and its been proven that there are hundreds of iterations of these events all ending in the death of our characters, why are there sometimes when there is one dead body and times where there piles of dead bodies? the movie ends after one character touches the rock and doesn't turn evil because ""reasons"" and leads another character out of the field in order to go back to a point where the character can save the two characters we start the movie with. I don't even want to get into the grass people or the baby eating because who cares. my over all problem with the movie is the inconsistency of the plots rules. I do think the movie looks OK, I have no problems with how the movie is shot or looks stylistically, the special effects aren't to bad and this is one of the gorier movies I've seen this year.",In the Tall Grass

SPOILERS: the ending was learning from your own life and the ones who don't, get stuck in the field, Travis chooses from his heart to let Tobi out of the field because of the rock, while Tobi's father was in love with the idea that he knows everything but in reality he doesn't know sh**, consumed by the rock he kills mostly everybody and then Travis takes on the roll of being stuck to let Tobi out.I feel that this movie should have been longer, the scenes were very nice the bloody skies the rock branches that had people crawling trying to get outTHE ONES WHO ARE FIXED ARE OUT, THE ONES WHO WANT KNOWLEDGE AND POWER ARE STUCK, but everyone chooses how rock influences them, the movie was 7.5/10, it gave me ""Mother"" vibes starring Jennifer Lawrence.",In the Tall Grass

It feels cheap and insulting to your audience and makes it seem like the writers wrote themselves into a corner they couldn't quite sort out.Pros: gorgeous camerawork and capable leadsCons: obvious logical flaws, unresolved subplots (grass cults?

This movie, just like the book depicts a labyrinth, and for our characters is a dark metaphor of the purgatory.The people lured inside are never meant to have a unidirectional path. T0 = getting in, T1= getting killed. No, this labyrinth is atemporal and a-dimentional and in a sense an organism, with a core ( the rock) which as soon as it is touched gives you a new status: resident of the purgatory, or if you like it more, you become part of it which is why you cannot or you will not want to leave after touching it.The horror of this movie isn't because of the creepy chanting, or the "" grass people"". No, the horror, the real horror is how incomprehensible this labyrinth is, with no rules and no ways out. Human mind is made to spot patterns, to create logical paths and take decisions accordingly. Then what happens when everything you can perceive time after time is put in such an illogical order that you cannot cope. The grass ""moves"" the living beings, your voice is now close and then far in the distance. Everything is in motion and only the dead stay in one place.This isn't some simple linear or circular story. Everything is as fragmented and mysterious as it was at the beginning.

655,adamgarrettmini,The Midnight Special,6,4 October 2019,"The problematic thing about horror movies that try to inject sci-fi into them, is that they tend to have an identity crisis when it comes to the ending. Into the Tall Grass is a perfect example of this. It expands upon the purely horror-based novel by King by adding a bit of sci-fi to increase the tension/inevitability of the horror aspects, however the ending ends up being weaker because it doesn't have the gravitas the ending of the novel had. I actually enjoyed the addition of all the sci-fi aspects throughout the movie UNTIL the end. When you have plot holes or unanswered questions in a horror-movie trope, you tend to let them go, because either everyone's SAFE or NOT SAFE at the end of the story - and most people leave it at that. Endings that lean on sci-fi aspects tend to be more open-ended and make you think, but then, you think about ALL of the plot holes throughout the entirety of the story. IF the ending is intentionally left open to interpretation, the entirety of the story starts to fall apart, and lessens the components of horror throughout.That being said, this movie gripped me throughout and the idea of being lost in tall grass is absolutely TERRIFYING, so that feeling held me through this surprisingly long film adaptation (I could have survived with 30 mins less, but still enjoyed til the end). I think my absolute favorite scene was when they hoisted Tobin on their shoulders above the grass and they were able to successfully navigate through the supernatural grass for a while. It was such a smart way to overcome the maze and made the characters seem much more formidable then just 'making the same mistakes' over and over. Of course, the plan inevitably fails, but I enjoyed them trying to figure their way out.
I thought the horror in this movie came extremely naturally, and though the sci-fi aspects and ending leaves you wanting just a little more, it delivered on it's premise and was a very enjoyable watch.",In the Tall Grass

664,thebahrams,"The Tall Grass, The Giant Rick,The Church= The Redeemer",8,6 October 2019,"This is one of those movies, if you fail to miss a small scene, then it will really confuse the hell out of you. My understanding of this movie is that the big giant rock in the centre of the field is linked to the church. In the bible, the New Testament the redemption word group is used to refer both to deliverance from sin and to freedom from captivity. The two main characters story is that Becky is leaving to give her child away to another family and leaving her husband. When they both hear a voice of a child calling for help. Both go into the field searching for him.What happens next they are all lost and searching for one another. Why I say the Rock is the redeemer, you touch it and it shows you the way back out? Simple- Ross has touched it and instead he turned into a greed man, who wanted nothing but to keep selling the idea of touching the rock is amazing- resembling a liar of a salesman; at the beginning of the story you see him on the phone talking to a member of staff regarding being untruthful, deceptive. That's why he would never show others the way around as he just wanted other to buy the idea of touching the rock.Tobin touched it; he was a child and said he knew the way out at the beginning- told Travis to touch it but he didn't. Tobin was free of sin and that's why nothing had happened to him.Becky; didn't touch the rock but the rock showed her a big lesson- of not giving the child away by feeding her the child, one flesh.Cal touched it; he Continued to die every-time, why because loved his sister more then he should, he kept telling her to continue the journey it giving your child away and leaving the father, he pushed Travis- attempted murder and continued to sin.Travis touching the rock- killed Ross first who was a man of sin to save himself and the rest. By touching the rock he did find the way out, sent the child back to stop Becky and Cal every entering the grass and stopping Travis every coming to search for them. The boy turns up in the church a person free of sin to send a message to Becky that taking the child away from his father is a bad idea, so she decided to return and stop by the police station to help the child as his parents are dead, dad being a sinner and killing his wife.It is a moving maze with only one way out, touch the rock and if you are sin free you are redeemed back into the church.",In the Tall Grass

However, it could have been just that bit better - may be fleshing out the characters just a little more would have helped.This was both well shot and well acted. Definitely some actors to watch who I hadn't seen before: Will Buie Jr., Harrison Gilbertson, Laysla De Oliveira. I would like to see more of these three and hope they get to do other films.

They venture into, as the title suggests, a field of tall grass after hearing a boy calling out for help.As soon as they enter, all is not what it seems and things take a strange turn when characters seemingly disappear and reappear along with other paranormal anomalies.The acting was subpar. It has it moments but the characters were mostly boring and one-dimensional. The brother (Avery Whitted) wasn't convincing and some of his parts took away from the good bits.The tone was done well and helped maintend the atmosphere and the plot was fairly decent as all questions get resolved by the end. (Despite some other reviewers having gripes about plot holes - the movie is pretty straightforward.)The ending does, however, leave one question lingering in the back of one's mind if they pay attention to the brother and sister's story arc.

692,c-18562,"In the Tall Grass, everything you need to know.",5,22 January 2020,"The movie In The Tall Grass was written in 2019 and aired on Oct. 4th, 2019. It was rated a 37% in rotten tomatoes meaning the movie was scored fairly low and considered quite lousy by the majority. It is in the horror genre, and has good elements and effects that horror movies require. The soundtrack of the movie gives off a very suspenseful, scary tone. The writers are Stephan King and Joe Hill, they have written many other films such as It, Children of the Corn, and The Shining. It was directed by Vincenzo Natali, many times over award winning Writer and Director. The primary actors in the film are Partick Wilson whom many of you probably know or have seen before and Laysla de Oliveira an up and coming actor.Now that you know a bit of information about the film, let's jump right into the details. So the theme of the film is mystery & suspense. It starts off with the main characters driving past a field when they hear a child's voice calling for help. They are then luerd into this never ending field which seems to have them trapped. The plot of the film is very straightforward and interesting to a certain degree. I think that it adds to the story because it makes it easy to follow and adds flow to the movie. The one thing about flow is you can only keep it going for so long. The film gets very dragged out and repetitive. It's predictable as to what is going to happen, spoiler alert; They almost gets to safety and the field moves them around again over and over. It gets very boring.The length of the movie itself is not very long, only one hour and 37 min. But if you have watched Pirates of the Carribiean's At World's End you know the feeling of a long, drawn out movie. The inspiration was a short story In the Tall Grass which was first seen in Esquire written by Stephen King and his son in 2012. That clears up the point of why this movie could bore you to death. It was a short story from a magazine that someone tried to make a movie out of. In the end, it ended up ""run(ing) too long and repeats itself too much to be as gripping as it's source material. Turns out there's a limit to how scary weeds can be."" said Noel Murray a top movie critic from the Los Angeles Times.So the beginning of the movie starts off very promising and succeeds early in the film. The only other downfall is the book to movie transition. It was almost as painful as watching Percy Jackson's The Lightning Thief. Correlation between the book/short story and movie was disappointing if you read it. Natali does take a good spin off of King and Hill's work. So if you haven't read the book I think that many will enjoy the movie and enjoy the King vibes it gives off.Apart from the tediousness and predictability that come with turing a short story into a movie and rough transition between book and movie the director did a good job with the other elements. The actors were a good fit to the movie I thought they did a really good job carrying out their character. It kept the movie a bit more engaging because it didn't seem as forced as the last half of the movie. Also the setting, costumes and makeup were done very well. They dressed the person accordingly to their character and the enditing that was used on the field setting was phenomenal. So for anyone that wants to put on a scary movie in the background, something that you don't have to pay much attention to I would recommend this movie. But for my film enthusiasts, this movie gets real boring real fast. It would of been much better as a 30 min short film.",In the Tall Grass

It is a slow burn, and yes, like I said previously, it can be confusing. I didn't find it scary. AT ALL. It's suspenseful at best. Very gory.

699,asharebalan,Color palette and the critique .,5,28 April 2020,"'IN THE TALL GRASS' is a netflix movie . The genre of this film is suspense and horror fiction. The director of the film is 'Vincenzo Natali'.PROPS:
Tall green grass
Red car
Blue car
Mysterious stone
Phone
Mostly the color used in this film is GREEN as in tall green grass, green is the dominant colour of nature which shows danger in the film.-Blood in the film shows the horror side.
-The mysterious stone shows fiction.
-The pregnant woman shows suspense.
This film left me pretty confused as there was no explanation in the film about the weird thing which were going on. In the film apparently time acts different when in the grass. Except the dead , the time and space are not perceived like a real world. I'm still confused about all the major events and the mysterious stone. I remember that tobin kid touching the stone at the same point, he should be evil then too?",In the Tall Grass

But I didn't say it out loud to my girlfriend because I wanted to have an open mind. Third error. Then I began rooting for the individual characters thru the absolute maze this movie was putting me thru - maniacal madness. Over and over and over again.

Huge hole, crawling with humanlike creeps. No more daylight from a certain point on...

It's evidently supposed to be a religiously symbolic journey through the long grass, but because none of the characters' motives have been established - and the motives that were established were not particularly strong - the religious intervention reads as overkill to a ridiculous degree.The cinematography is too dark to be accessible, and the sound design is terrible, so it's best watched with subtitles if watched at all.

As others have said this a slow burn type of movie, that subtly pulls the viewer in.This is well acted and the cinematography is very good. This movie has a simple plot that unfolds throughout the movie, so viewers do need to pay attention. As an artist I really did appreciate the cinematography, they did a good job conveying the tone of the movie.The movie creatively pokes fun at religious fanatics. Additionally, the movie makes a statement about the decisions we make in life. People can never hope to improve their situation if they keep making the same poor decisions. The movie eventually shows this in a clever way.Initially, I thought the rock was alien but there's a specific scene that makes it more obvious that it's ""traditional"" evil that promotes satanic rituals and punishes humans for being human.This type of move isn't for everyone, but that doesn't mean its bad. I feel like movies that quietly poke fun of how foolish people can be and anything with any hint of religion - is automatically hit or miss. However, if characters making poor decisions is a complaint... then it's best to just wall yourself off from society. Real people do dumb things everyday, without silly mistakes, horror/thrillers wouldn't even exist.",In the Tall Grass
712,lilith_sve,What's a time paradox? : A beginner's guide.,3,6 October 2019,"The ""Triangl...oops sorry I meant ""In the Tall Grass"", is the kind of movie you would really enjoy if you were 12-13, freshly getting into horror, and time travel/paradoxes/loops were an unknown thing for you.Sadly, I'm a grown woman, and I love time paradoxes done properly and this... wasn't.First of all, it's basically if ""Triangle"" met up with Wicker Man and made a Grass Baby in front a stone, which I'm pretty sure is the weird brother of the Monolith from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". And that BABA is not cute at all!!!The movie reminded me heavily of the Triangle. Not necessarily because of the time loop (time loops in storytelling are more ""story types"" rather that ""story lines"" in my opinion), but the way the loop is presented to us made me scream ""BE ORIGINAL"" more than once at my screen. (dramatic, I know).
The worst thing you can do when ""taking inspiration"" from other pieces of art, is blatantly copying scenes. This is what really got to me. Like, there are some visuals, taken straight from Triangle (that I won't say to avoid spoilers). And Triangle wasn't even that great of a movie.Another thing that bumped me out: The lack of suspense. You know when you hear about a movie having a time loop or a time paradox and you 're all like ""wow there's gonna be TONS of plot twists!""? Now I'm not saying have a plot twist for the sake of having a plot twist, nor am I saying that suspense is only achieved through plot twists. But if ""Predestination"" is the hilarious example of having TOO many plot twists, ""In the Tall Grass"" is at the opposite side of the spectrum. There's just nothing there!As soon as you realize (they pretty much tell you) that there is a time loop (10-15 mins into the movie), that's it. You know where it's going, and you even know how you're gonna get there. Like, for example when the brother of the female protagonist picks up his phone and you hear a woman's voice telling them something in distress you KNOW its her from the future and the characters are like ""wait, what?"" ""what was that?"" ""weird"". And THEN, when the moment foretold by the ""weird woman on the phone"" is taking place, no character even acknowledges it, so what was even the point of the phone call? Was it a ""subtle"" wink to the audience? And if so, why? We know we are in a time loop, you've told us!So, if there are no great plot twists in the story, how can we raise tension? Characters, their interactions and secrets! Although here, the characters are one dimensional (the pregnant lady, the over protective brother, the burnout ex-boyfriend, the Ambitious Salesman(!)...the KID.... the MOM) their interactions are minimum because for the majority of the movie they just run around helpless, and the secrets are... ""secrets"".So... wanna talk about the Wicker Man part? Me neither!! So I'll ignore the fact that the ""occult chant"" that you could hear in the (for luck of a better word) ""ritual"", reminded me heavily of that scene in Finding Nemo where the fish go ""Ha hu wa he ha ho ho ho"". I' ll ignore the fact that I started chanting ""Ha hu wa he ha ho ho ho"" to pass the time in these scenes because I was loosing my mind with this movie. I'll ignore the weird visuals that were going on that reminded me of cinematic trailers for videogames from the early '10s.But... I' ll focus on the real hero of this movie. Patrick Wilson! And you know why he's a hero?? Because HE GOT ME THROUGH THIS MOVIE! And because he fed us all those awful lines he had with passion and commitment like a champ! And because his character in that movie was the only one that made SENSE AND THAT SAYS A LOT!
Minute 10 I would have touched the stone, no question about it! Because firstly, when the stone was first introduced we knew almost nothing of the world of the movie and we would have no reason not to touch it (especially after trying for hours to escape with no progress) and because Patrick Wilson would have told me so, of course take my soul, who needs it anyway??!It baffled me when I saw that the writers of the book are Stephen King and Joe Hill. Because yeah, Stephen King has his ups and downs (he has written an entire library of books by now), but Joe Hill's ""Locke and Key"" is one of my favorite comic book series and ""In the Tall Grass"" seemed a pretty weak story to me. Like, I don't think it was just the director's fault. I think he also didn't have a great deal of content to work with.TLDRStory: 3/50 shades of grey

758,hidayetbaysal,Why?,3,5 October 2019,"I might be spending more effort writing this review than people who made this movie, I always found myself asking why, why the rock? why does the guy want to kill everybody? to make them touch the rock? why are they stuck in there? if the field is capable of merging parallel universes why would the pregnant woman be able to call herself on the phone or be warned by the little kid at the en?",In the Tall Grass

762,kingacevedo,"Turn away from the grass, and run!",1,5 January 2020,"So after watching this I was sooooo confused, so many plot holes, boring parts, etc. I looked up other people's explanation of this movie and even though I see what the base theory of the story is, I still think it's a horrible script. Please save your time and skip this one. By the way the main villain is a large rock, that looks like a great big turd.",In the Tall Grass

767,rajatkaushalzeus,Good Enough,8,5 October 2019,"I like horror movies without many jump scares. And this movie doesn't have many if not any jump scare. It scares you with that feeling of unknowing and claustrophobia. Initially you can't even figure out why the grass is acting like that. And even when they show that rock,It is still unknown that what kind of entity it is. I loved the helplessness and madness of characters and actors who portrayed it did a good job.
That being said, It has its flaws. Most importantly that you don't really connect with the characters and you won't feel bad if any or all of them end up dying. They just feel shallow and have no depth at all.",In the Tall Grass
768,singhero,Tries too hard to be cool,1,19 November 2019,"All i see is lazy ... ""Twisst"" and ""abstract scenes""... You know when you ran out of things to fill in instead of really focus on building the characters.Characters are boring, its too bland, even a loaf bread can do better (and i love bread). And i see no, absolutely no reasons why they characters act like that.",In the Tall Grass
769,genewillpride,Decent late night thriller,8,5 October 2019,"Not great, but still worth watching. Keeps you guessing and slightly on edge the whole time. Wish I knew if it was evil or aliens or whatever it was that was going on.",In the Tall Grass
770,susan_m_ellis,"Ease up guys, it's Stephen King!!!",8,5 October 2019,"The master story teller strikes again. It's a ""story"". It's a diversion from the real world for a couple of hours and it's fun and has its surprises along the way. Just leave it there. Everything doesn't add up? It's a story, and like a dream, it doesn't need to. It's beautifully filmed and the acting is good especially Will Buie Jr. as Tobin, the young boy lost in the grass. I Loved it!",In the Tall Grass

777,poisonumbrella,A good movie.,7,6 October 2019,"I don't get all the bashing here. Clearly, it's a movie after a Stephen King short story, and you get exactly this vibe from it. I found it entertaining and creepy. No stupid jump scares. The story is really original. If you want logical decisions and believable plots, go read a history book instead. If you want some entertaining two hours on your couch during a lazy weekend - this movie is for you.",In the Tall Grass
