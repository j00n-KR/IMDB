0,Leofwine_draca,Twists you definitely won't see coming,6,15 July 2018,"Twist follows twist in this complex psychological drama from South Korea. FORGOTTEN is the story of two brothers, one of whom is kidnapped violently by persons unknown only to turn up, seemingly unharmed, some three weeks later. However, his brother is concerned by his sibling's unusual behaviour, and the plot develops from there. Let me say that this is one film where you WON'T be able to figure out the myriad twists and turns that develop throughout the narrative, because they're completely out of left field and quite original too. The film's production values are typically strong, as with all modern Korean cinema, and there's a good amount of scary dream sequences, action in the form of frenetic chases, and character complexity to make this work.",Forgotten
1,kosmasp,Never forget,9,22 December 2020,"Netflix has quite some interesting movies/productions and this is one of them. Korean thrillers are quite good most of the time anyway (at least in my book). One may wonder where they come up with that stuff and ideas. But I'm happy they do and I happily watch them too.Like this one, that keeps you guessing from the start to the finish. Certainly some decisions may feel akward or wrong that characters take, but that is just how things work. Also it will make sense (more or less) in the end. Keep guessing, keep trying to figure out where this goes - it's almost impossible I'd say. Unless you've read a synopsis and even then, it had to be quite thorough ... so I urge go in this without reading too much about it and enjoy the thriller you are being served ... and the enticing story with it ... I don't totally agree with the ending this chooses, but it makes sense with the sensibilities and the mood overall ...",Forgotten
2,paul_haakonsen,"Implausible storyline, but otherwise entertaining enough movie...",6,26 December 2018,"I am a big fan of South Korean cinema, and I usually jump at any chance I get to sit down and watch a movie to make it out of South Korea. As I did when I got the chance to watch ""Forgotten"" (aka ""Gi-eok-ui bam"").I must admit that I didn't know what the movie was about, nor did I know who starred it in or even what kind of genre it was. It was Asian and from South Korea, that was all the persuasion I needed.The movie does start out great, and the events that take place in the movie really had me puzzled. I didn't figure out what was going on before it was revealed towards the end. So director and writer Hang-jun Jang managed to pull off a nice trick here, as I was kept in the dark throughout the course of the movie.However, I must admit that somewhere along the midway of the movie, give or take, I did feel like the movie was starting to lose some of its appeal and my interest started to ebb. So there was somewhat of a slump there that had to be overcome.The acting in the movie was quite good, and they had some nice actors and actresses on the cast list to perform these various different roles and characters.The ending of the movie was very, very anti-climatic, and it just wholeheartedly sent an abrupt blockade on what would otherwise have been a very entertaining movie. And the ending is the reason why I am lowering my score to a 6 out of 10 stars, whereas it was otherwise set to get a 7 out of 10 stars.While the events throughout the movie was somewhat confusing, but then started to make sense once you figure out what was going on, it just felt like the entire plot of the movie was so very implausible and just felt horribly staged and that also took away from the enjoyment of the movie.All in all, ""Forgotten"" is an entertaining enough movie, if you enjoy a mystery thriller, with emphasis on mystery. But this is hardly among the top of the line in entertainment to make it out of South Korean cinema, not even by a long shot.",Forgotten
3,phd_travel,One unpredictable movie - absorbing,7,11 July 2020,"There are some good points about this movie. It draws you in and keeps you interested. The plot is unpredictable with some twists that take you by surprise. When it seems there are just too many things to be explained, don't worry there is an explanation. It's far fetched but throrough - too elaborate a scheme to achieve the outcome. I was entertained but I wish the ending had been different. Kang Ha Neul acts well. He is a convincing actor unlike some of the newer generation.",Forgotten
4,deloudelouvain,The best Korean movie I saw until now,8,1 March 2018,"I saw already a lot of Asian movies and most of the times they're just not my cup of soup. But every now and then you get a little gem. Like this one. And I'm not surprised it's a Korean one, because almost all the good Asian movies I saw before were Korean. I couldn't tell you if I saw those actors before because I just can't memorize their names. But these actors have definitely qualities. Forgotten or Gi-eok-ui-Bam is a very captivating story that will keep your attention from the beginning till the end. It's a very well made mystery movie with a lot of twists and turns. Twists that you don't see coming at all. To me Forgotten is one of the best if not the best Korean movie I saw until now.",Forgotten
5,paulclaassen,"Wow, amazing thriller!",7,31 July 2019,"I absolutely love Korean cinema for their unique story telling and unpredictability. 'Forgotten' did not disappoint!Bloody hell, I never expected this film to be so scary and creepy! It literally gave me gooseflesh! There are so many twists. From an average family moving into a new home, to hearing strange noises from a room in the house, to a kidnapping, and strange behavior, this was an incredible roller coaster ride of emotion, thrills and chills! The acting was also very good and convincing.The action and suspense is masterfully done, and the reveal during the final act left me sitting there thinking ""I never expected this!"" Wow, wow, wow, this was absolutely amazing! 'Forgotten' takes the viewer in so many directions, this film deserves to be watched a few times to fully grasp the impact.",Forgotten
6,RosanaBotafogo,Excellent film...,9,8 May 2021,"Very good, South Korean cinema really has great works to be discovered, a dramatic and mysterious suspense, if it is not original, at least it is ingenious and well produced, it leaves us confused and intrigued, a lot of the time, we were trying to understand the enigma, the still yields some good scares, persecutions and anguish... Wonderful script, fantastic development, we are completely connected... The final scene was a little sad... Excellent film...",Forgotten
7,jtindahouse,A twisted ride perfectly constructed for maximum enjoyment,9,17 July 2021,"The greatest feat a filmmaker can achieve in my opinion is to make a complicated movie easy to understand for an audience. When a film is as complex and layered as 'Forgotten' and yet you never once find yourself lost in the plot, that's a real achievement. The story structure of this movie is fantastic. This was a fun ride.The film begins with some clunky narration with a character speaking about his brother. It felt like the beginning of one of those old 'Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction' segments. I was a little worried at that point, however from there the movie flourishes. The characters are complex and deep, the dialogue is interesting and subtle and the story has a great element of mystery to it right until the end.I'm still yet to find a bad Korean movie. They just don't make them seemingly. 'Forgotten' is a dark, well paced and brilliantly crafted film that is well worth your time. 9/10.",Forgotten

12,gedikreverdi,It's all forgotten indeed,8,1 June 2021,"The main character had an accident which killed his parents and had his brother need a surgery. For money he agreed to kill a woman and accidentally killed one of her kids too. The man who was supposed to pay him for killing the woman was the woman's husband and his brother's doctor. After an altercation, the doctor fell off the rooftop. After years the killer was found by the families of victims and hypnotized him to learn what happened. But the man who is the sole survivor from the home of the victims got arrested right before they set up the murder scene for him. They told him he was abducted and returned after 19 days and remember nothing about the kidnappers and all. And then he found out they're not his family and the revelation at the police station was really impressive. He learnt that the year is not 1997 and he's not 21. And he looked at the mirror and saw his older real face. He jumped off the car to be able to get away from them and got hit by a car. After the surgery he told the son of the doctor that his father didn't ask him to kill his wife but the son didn't buy it and jumped off a window and took his own life. The killer injected the poison that the son left and killed himself too. And it's all forgotten.",Forgotten
13,Aktham_Tashtush,Shocking .. in an extremely good way.,9,15 December 2018,"The movie was just well written, well directed and amazingly acted ...The plot itself was so mysterious and gave so little up until the end when things started to really untangle, and even then, they gave another shocking emotional scene ,, the screenplay was tight and so connected but aside from that it was quick and has absolutely no dull unnecessary lines,, everything had to mean something and it apparently does ""right when the truth comes out"".Casting wise,, Mu-Yeol Kim and Ha-Neul Kang did a phenomenal job ,, the whole cast did ,, but the due just kept on swapping characters back and forth and maintaining mystery and emotional expressions ""especially at the end"" just topped everything.Final thought,, When i'm asked why i follow the Korean cinema in the last few years i just start naming movies and plot stories ,, but to be clear ,, back in the day ""70's-90's"" the Japanese Drama and film industry had the lead in east Asia while Korea back then had a lot of other issues to deal with ,, I personally believe that this period is the time where Korean film industry rises ,, and we have seen that through TV first ,, and in the last 10 years in the film industry ,, It is not as big in the production area but it is getting there and more investors from Hollywood are now more interested.,., so let's just set back, bring the popcorn and enjoy this era.",Forgotten

If those twin scourges of Korean cinema don't bother you like it does me, then ""Forgotten"" is a fairly decent flick with its twists and turns. All in all, the acting wasn't so bad, but as I've said before, it often reminds me of the very early days of silent movies where actors were told to over-emote so the average movie goer could see ""Hey, this guy's scared,"" or ""Hey, this woman's sad."" Terrible.",Forgotten
15,ridi-arahan,Is our perception really as accurate or is it distorted to appeal what we want to perceive?,9,7 March 2021,"What worked:
The hard part about twists, subplots and complex narrative in a movie is an execution. What's in the page may not always replicate on the stage. This movie was not one of those movies. It's a very well written and executed piece of art, making it a movie that we love to watch multiple times. I think the right balance of thrills and twists was done for the movie making it such an amazing movie viewing experience. The movie is a thrill ride like we say and it's unpredictability is it's biggest asset. I would not have been pleased if the twists were done poorly or was done in a rush. The pause and timing makes the movie viewing enough time to comprehend the essence of the series of events thus giving a fine overall experienceWhat did not work:
I think somewhere around the last half of the movie, it turned into somewhat melodramatic or cliche scenes. I would have wanted otherwise or the scenes done in a not so contemporary manner as the movie overall does. Also, minor flaws or poor choreographed scenes were present but not in a fashion that it hampered the narrative. I would not have mind if the movie has a slightly different ending in terms of the overall insight into the finale but it's still a very fine and well done finale
Final verdict: highly recommended",Forgotten

17,TwistedContent,Quality Mystery,8,26 August 2021,"If there's one thing I know, South Koreans are skilled in making amazing murder mysteries, and mysteries/horror in general. Hollywood wishes for a script like this. One reviewer here said that lovers of ""Oldboy"" will like this, and I couldn't agree more.We follow Jin-Seok and his family, as they move in a new house. The house gives Jin-Seok weird vibes, and some oddities start to happen, until one night his brother Yoo-Seok is abducted. He returns after 19 days with no memory, and seeming like a changed man. Jin-Seok's chase for the truth starts now, and it'd be a crime to tell anything more than this, because this is one of those amazing movies that can rightfully be described as unpredictable. I watched it with a friend, and both of us did not figure this flick out correctly. Director and writer Hang-jun Jang, with inspirations from real life (a cousin of his friend's disappeared for a month and returned feeling different to others), has created a tight, atmospheric and highly engaging mystery with horror undertones. Besides the plot, ""Forgotten"" is visually beautiful, with a fantastic original score and great performances all around.This is a great addition to a pool of great Korean thrillers, including ""Oldboy"", ""The Chaser"", ""Memories of Murder"" etc. - if you like any of these, believe me, Forgotten is for you. 8/10.",Forgotten
18,baunacholi-86159,Unparalleled,9,8 April 2020,"Every now and then u might stumble over a movie which turns out to be a hidden gem. Forgotten is one of this kind. The cover didn't give me anything nor the synopsis but I'm glad I gave it a try based on IMDB recommendations. What starts as a pretty standard flick (happy family moves into a dark mansion and soon strange things happen) turns quickly upside down and twists arise u never ever think of. This is how a mystery thriller should look and feel like ! It does everything right. It's throughout so tense, so creepy, so unexpected and most importantly so convincing. No special effects, no cheesy Happy End to please the audience. Forgotten navigates with ease from creepy to disturbing to heart wrenching without loosing identity. Even in OV with subtitles it was a hell of a ride and I have added another outstanding movie to my list of all time favorites.",Forgotten
19,krachtm,Comparisons to Oldboy are difficult to avoid,7,28 February 2018,"The plot: a young adult becomes concerned when his older brother seems to have been replaced by an imposter.If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, you should see this. It's unpredictable to say the least, and I often find psychological thrillers a bit disappointing in their predictability. So, if you're the kind of person who loves a mystery, this will be a good watch. The initial grab is quite interesting, and you're constantly wondering how the filmmakers will resolve everything. The climax didn't come out of nowhere, but it did leave me feeling a bit less satisfied than a masterpiece like Oldboy, which is an inevitable comparison.Beware spoilers.

Gi-eok-ui bam (2017) delivers a good plot with strong characters and next to no flaws.You start slow. Jin-seok and his family have just arrived in their new home. They seem like a happy and healthy family: two great parents, a brilliant brother, and Jin-seok, the insecure but pure youngest.Your first plot twist: no one can enter one particular room in the house. Apparently, the old resident has his stuff there and demanded privacy. And then Yoo-seok is abducted. But he returns 19 days later with no scratches and no recollection of what happened during those 19 days.This is where this film really begins. The film does a good job of keeping the tension, the suspense, and the audience's curiosity. There are some very suspenseful moments and traces of horror. Overall, very entertaining.The actors are great. They feel real. Nothing seems robotic.The plot is outstanding. In the end, you are deeply involved and affected. I was.I only have two minor complaints:One dream sequence adds nothing to the plot. It is just one dumb exploitation.I wonder why they usually depict Korean cops as either buffoons or unreliable.Definitely recommendable. You shouldn't expect a lot of action, even though there are a few. This is about suspense and a well-written plot.",Forgotten
24,quaseprovisorio,it's very well filmed and keeps you guessing but has more turns than a mountain road.,7,24 April 2020,"I enjoyed the film i can't say otherwise. the characters are strong, mostly the two brothers. the narrative starts of very very well until they explain what's going on and when that happens you have two options: or you start wondering about narrative flaws or you just go with the flow and put suspension of disbelief pretty high. i kinda tried to do both at the same time. the film is very human on how portraits the characters. it also has good action sequences, and some of the plot turns are pretty good and effective, they made me feel genuinly surprised. i even had a jump scare which is very very rare for me.the main issue is with the main discovery and how the movie wants you to accept that. i actually have no problems with the other turns (even though one or two were pretty unnecessary), just with the main one. because i was very entertained with this movie and i do think it's stil a good one - that maybe needed a bit of polishing in the narrative. it's still emotive and even poetic at a certain time, and wans you think about contemporary issues. and let's face it, until the main plot point i was completely engaged!it's still amazing how korean directors and screenwriters put the focus on the characters and that they represent. let's hope with parasite hollywood finally learns something, but i'm not very confident about it. i would recommend it for people who love a good thriller and are more enthusiastic by being entertained than by cherry picking the plot. if you start doing that, you might get disappointed. but i don't think neither 4/10 or 0/10 reviews are correct: i think this is a good movie, but not in the lenghts of olboy, i saw the devil, memories of murder or even parasite. still at least better than 80% of modern american thrillers.",Forgotten

intriguing at first. obviously something was going on, but what.
The worker's questioning concerning the brothers was brilliantly referred to later on. 
the first let down was the wrong leg limp. Then there was the taxi mistake. The second one wasn't needed. as the pen nib was enough. Then there were the cliches of the phone going off, or somebody being called, or told to look somewhere place, so our nominal hero won't be discovered. There was also the mother talking on the phone, and saying more than she needed to. 
QUESTION; Why didn't the mobther lock the window?
But then there came the big reveal. which had me stunned.
later, another big reveal made me question how realistic it was. But I went with it.
After that the movie had me changing my mind at almost every turn. 
My imdb rating veered between 10/9/8/7/6.

Hang jun Zhang
 I have been looking to write something about Korean movies some years ago when I began to watch the epic products like Old Boy and I Saw the Devil I just struck at some point and I could not done it then. But now, one verge of watching another fantastic work from the Korean film industry I just wanted to open up some of my views revolving around Korean movies. Forgotten is a great piece of creativity and it belts me to sit back in front of my laptop for this writing. Yes of course, I'm more fascinated and twisted about the movie, Forgotten.
 As a film buff I do watch all kinds of films belong to any languages and I am very much pleased about some of the works from Korean. Korean films are actually a matter of wonder while I watch it for the first time I can remember the movie (I saw the Devil) and it haunts me days after days. Old boy is another epic work which I considered Korean films has their own identity and they laid a huge stone in the path way of the cinema field. It's hardly to remember the names accurately because their language is so complicated so subtitle must need to understand the movies wholly. I knew some names in the industry Choi Min Sik (the actor of Oldboy and I Saw the Devil), Park won chok (director) and other names are even harder to recollect. So writing about Korean movies is actually a great task for me because it is actually blend with their geographical and internal aspects and somehow their counterpart, North Korean ideologies and views. They have to deal with their neighbors because they are their greatest foe. Cultural mechanism is completely aligned with the South Korean aspects and at the same time North Korean is always go along with the Defensive mechanism. Through that cultural as well as the creative part South Korea always proclaims and marching a cold war towards North Korea. That's why films had had greater impact on the lives of Korean people and it rotates along with abnormality that lies around their world.
 What I throw back around Korean films is Forgotten, which I watched recently and astonished by the movie that always resounds me to write something. That is the reason for me to jump into such a wonderful task of dealing with Korean movies. Let take a break and talk about Forgotten. Forgotten is a wonderful piece of cracking twists and turn plots which goes through an evident level of thinking and perception. The movie goes so smoothly at the beginning then there happens a incredible dimension throughout. When we finished the movie we just bang with the vibrating effect of the characterization and the subject that growling completely through our vision. This might be the congested writing about Forgotten.
 The movie goes along with Jin Seok and his amnesiac condition in which all other characters just plays along with him to keep the momentum high. It can be somehow relate with the effective technique that followed by Christopher Nolan in Memento, or The Bourne Identity or somehow Mulholland Drive. The title correctly depicts the actual ambience of the movie but that lies only at the initial part. The mirror scene at the Police Station burst out our heads when the characterization got changed. We struck little bit at some point and then we regain when their planning works and step atop into another level. So the movie got the first deviation from the mirror scene. Then we enter into the thrilling part of the movie. In and out focus effects bang with a speedy accompanied background score arose at this part. The victim looks more anger towards the accused and he is out of control to kill him. There uses the fast movement of camera. One, who is on the way of escape and the other he is on the way of capturing. That's the nail biting sequence created by the director. When the thrilling side reach at the edge of ending portion there comes the dramatic impact of the movie. A drama, which was happened in the past, carried through by a voice-over and we find and realize the innocence of the accused.
 The stages or the layers that we were talked about is simply represent the concurrent move of the film but actually it went across some kind of perception where the audience have the full authority to judge whether the protagonist is right or wrong. Anyway what I admire about the movie is the well encircled script and well managed direction. These two branches worked together for the fruitful ending of the movie. And I'm very much happy because both the department (writing and direction) were handled by the same person. He is the correct auteur in some way and he is a great technician also. Forgotten will be remembered not only in the Korean film field but also in the mind of entire film buffs around the world.",Forgotten
30,bcheng93,is everybody watching the same movie i'm watching....a 7.1 rating?,1,6 March 2018,"I voted the movie a 1 star because it sure didnt deserve a 7.1 rating thats for sure.
its been awhile since i've reviewed a movie but an over-all rating here of 7.1 just made me plain mad.
hence the 1 star vote to try to knock the rating down a little bit. i love korean movies by the way and i personally feel that they make the best thrillers in the world at this time.
the true rating if i wasnt trying to knock down the score would be somewhere in the mid 5s' to maybe a 6. 
5.5 would be a perfect score for the movie overall as a matter of fact. its a professionally done movie and the story actually starts of well and continue'd to be pretty good, it was fairly imaginative and will probably keep the majority of its audience interested and guessing up to the 1/2 point of the movie. the acting wasnt bad either. even up to 3/5ths of the movie it was still pretty good....but after that, i'm guessing the writer either just got lazy or ran out of ideas on how to end the movie. from a fairly good movie in the 6.5 range, after the 3/5ths point, the movie just falls apart. i mean ridiculous and just plain lazy how they finished the last 2/5ths of the movie...especially after the younger brother accepts the job and is in the house where he was suppose to do the job. it just totally falls of the cliff from there, normal or even unnormal people would not do the things that they did...meaning the 2 brothers but of course it would have been impossible to wrap up the movie and the writer just plain ran out of ideas. i pondered over the ending and admit it was hard to end the movie logically but try at least. so....for the majority of us movie lovers, the first 3/5ths was fairly good and then it loses all logic from there on out. you have been warned.",Forgotten

41,daryopeek,"Amazing suspense flick, if you could ignore the others",7,23 February 2019,"Gi-eok-ui bam or literally translated as ""Memory of the Night"" follows a young man with his family moves to a new house in 1997. After an older brother kidnapped and back, his younger brother believes the one coming's back isn't his brother.Building suspense and twist, somehow is an easy work to do by Koreans filmmakers. Watching movies or series by them, even though it is a drama, many substantial plot sequence were built by an unpredictable twist followed by even more shocking climax. This movie has an amazing job to do that, with many mysterious thing happened in the first part of the movie, you are dragged to follow a story that doesn't too complex in its nature, but the way the writer/director bends the plot is carrying all of the suspense until the last part.It is the sudden drama acts that change all the movie's pace stop me for giving this movie higher score. The drama, while quite good and intriguing, follows similar pattern you can find in almost all Korean drama. It is not bad, but after giving us a really good trip to the twist, the cliche let the tension down.Probably, if you could attached to the emotional scenes that probably intended so that the movie will be more impactful, this is one for you. However, seeing somebody hit by a vehicle, person of your past coming back in unprecedented way, or brothers giving bromance and cute scenes seem so dramatic it's restrict me to like this movie more. So, for those who like the movie about suspense mixed by drama elements, or just ignore it, this title could be hit a spot in your top 10 films.",Forgotten

We hear constantly noises and the main character, the little brother, even saw a sort of creature coming out of it. But this is all just a side episode in the movie, the main stream is about the refound brother who changed in a lot of ways. His leg is no longer damaged and he can normally walk. He never swore before, now he does. He never smoked and now he smokes. The younger brother explains it all to his mother who looks very empathic but then he hears a conversation where she calls him names (I was not allowed to use here) and tells to the person on the phone (the older brother) that the younger brother found out everything. So up to this point the movie looked very intriguing. But then it turns out that the very sympathetic younger brother commited a murder years ago and the people around him are only pretending to be his mom, dad and brother because they only want to find out why. So it was an unexpected turn. The murder for me was a bit fabricated.

The acting was good, the cinematography was good, the plot was good. Something to be aware of tho, many Korean phrases don't have direct English translations, I know this since I'm learning Korean.

71,Ginsengjin,Disappointing movie.,4,9 October 2018,This movie is basically an average quality Korean drama condensed down into 2 hours. The story line would have worked for a Korean drama because the twists and turns of the story line would have been presented slowly with more focus on character development but when it is presented all in one viewing the story is just too much to be believable. The character development is also important for a Korean drama because the viewer feels a connection with the characters (good and the bad) but this is lacking in the movie.The cinematography is also bland as well as it is just too colorful to fit the gritty story line. They could have started it out colorful and made it gradually gritty near the end reflecting the story line which would have been a much better artistic direction but they just kept it with the typical K-drama look.I personally would not recommend this movie as you don't really get much out of it.

86,MarumeChiisa,Korean Drama version of 'Shutter Island',4,2 July 2018,"My sisters recommended this movie (because of Kang Haneul) and we went to watch together. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, we took bet about who was the weird one, and I bet for the main character (I said he was a serial killer or something), my first sister bet for the brother acting weird (he was a serial killer, or a gang boss), while my other sister, being contrary that she was, bet for the parents.At some point, it looked like the brother did act weird (which made my sister grinning smugly), and then the parents (now it was my other sister's turn to grin), but, at that point (around the middle of the movie), I blurted out ""'Shutter Island', no doubt."" Out of my sisters, only one had watched 'Shutter Island' with me before, so she immediately recognized the reference, while the other one didn't really understand what I was talking about, so she demanded me to explain what would happen to the main character based on Shutter Island's plot and they hit quite close to the mark, which surprised her later on.Honestly though, this movie is basically 'Shutter Island' wrapped in Korean drama cliches. The first half managed to make me curious, but then, it grew rather boring since the plot is really similar to 'Shutter Island', even the ending was quite similar, although, once again, got even more dramaticised by typical Korean movie/drama's flair. I'm not saying they copied 'Shutter Island' idea, but it wasn't any better that 'Shutter Island', so I wasn't really impressed.What I don't like the most was the acting of the brother and fake mother-father when they confronted Jin-Seok to tell him the truth in the room where he killed the women. They acted way too arrogant that it looked two dimensional, like an anime character. Jin-Seok's portrayal itself wasn't really convincing as someone who had dissociative fugue and in a really great shock after being told such revelation, so it was hard to connect with his desperation and all that (the flashback scene was rather moving though, but again, the acting--or maybe the dialogue--wasn't really convincing). They still had a lot to learn from the master of desperation like Leonardo DiCaprio, LOL. He had been desperate to get an Oscar, probably what drove him to deliver superb acting from time to time until he finally won one.Overall, it was a good watch for those who haven't watched 'Shutter Island', but this type of drama played by real human isn't really my cup of tea (I don't mind this kind of drama in anime, though). So, 4/10 for predictable plot and unnecessary drama. Feel free to disagree, though :)",Forgotten

So many good movies came from south-korea ""Oldboy"", ""Joint Security Area"", ""Symphaty for Mr. Vengance"", ""Lady Vengance"", ""I saw the devil"". All really great movies!But comparing this film with ""Oldboy"" is a little bit too much.It has a really nice setup, you have the family moving to the unsettling home, it keeps you to the edge of your seat during the first 30 minutes, wondering what's going to happen next. You wonder what's going on, what's really happening. But then, it happens, the plot-twist hurricane.Too many plot-twist, such amount that gets ridiculous. The first plot-twist happens more or less 30 minutes into the film, you watch it and you're like:-""Okay, didn't see that coming, I guess that they are going to go deeper into this the rest of the film"". And they do it, but there's a lot more of plot-twist, one after another, and you start thinking:-""Okay why did they took so many troubles to do all this?"". That, plus a couple of plot holes really trashed the film.Don't get me wrong, if you saw ""Oldboy"" you know that the plot-twist is a little bit exaggerated, but this is even more. More that I can bear to take a film seriously.The acting is really good, nothing clumsy, the actors did a really good job showing their emotions and making it believable. The filming is really good, really good shots adding to the thrills. But the plot, is such a shame. This is like a plot-twist driven movie. Imagine that you're watching the story about a family of squirrels, and then happens that the squirrel's father is actually a dog,
 and then happens that they're not living in a tree but in a dumpster, and then happens that nothing was real, all was someone's dog dream.

And then the little details start to happen, such as the camera fixing on the year that is stated on the calender, then random noises that nobody else seems to hear, and then all of a sudden on a rainy night, Jin's brother gets kidnapped by these people, disappearing for 19 days.When he comes back, he's a totally different person but he can't seem to remember anything before acting all strange. This is one of those films that is hard to put into real words because of how well done it is. We never would have guessed that Jin was the one who was different. Hypnosis disguised as anxiety meds? That's just awesome. A great touch. Then all of a sudden the rest of the characters start acting different. Finally, we find out that his family is not his family, that Jin's brother Yu is actually the kid that Jin spared from murder.Not to mention the plot of the film takes place during the very real financial crisis of 1997 in Asia. That's something completely new, and different. I had no idea that was a historical event and was actually very interesting to read up more on.The ending when we see why Yu was spared as a kid poses two different perspectives if the viewer really pays attention. Does Jin spare him because he didn't scream or because he offered him his lollipop? Could even be a third perspective that is left unsaid. I think for me personally, the element that they were able to try and spark Jin's memory in Yu's childhood home is priceless. Not only that but going that elaborate as well is amazing.Like I said, it's really hard to put into words how this film is, but it's amazing and beautiful. I recommend it.",Forgotten

110,DaliParton,The Dumb Cancels Out the Good,5,17 December 2018,"The movie starts out with what is an obviously unreliable narrator. But then there are a couple of points in the story where we find out that regardless of the narrator's problems, there is something more going on. So that makes for some pretty good suspense.Midway through the movie there is a sort of race scene where one character has to get into a bedroom before the other one does in order to pretend to be asleep. It's a scene that's been done to death in a hundred other movies before and it was at that point that the movie starts to go downhill - instead of something innovative the writer went with an uninspired cliche.Unfortunately the climax of the movie relies on a suspension of disbelief that is beyond anything even remotely plausible. Without getting into spoilers the actual murders are just too dumb to be believed. The first one alone relies on a character making the stupidest possible choice at every single turn. But then the second murder happens exactly the same way. Puh-lease! I just couldn't get past how lazy, dumb and contrived it was. It really drags the entire movie down.And then the movie ends on a gratuitous flashback showing that the murderer met his victims in more innocent times. Its a cool idea but the execution was utterly lazy because the writer didn't bother to set up any explanation for it beyond pure coincidence, they just threw it in out of nowhere in order to be cute.In the end, this movie is a disappointment. The best korean thrillers stand above the best from all other countries. But this one has too many flaws due to contrived and lazy writing. Its 2nd tier at best.",Forgotten

115,toskomst,A solid B-thriller.,7,13 February 2018,"This is a nice little thriller with an intricate plot that's almost impossible to outline without spoiling something. I suppose that in itself is a spoiler. But anyway.Kang Ha-neul plays a 20-something student, Jin-seok, who, along with his big brother and their parents, move into a new house. He's a hypersensitive guy, having nightmares and hearing strange sounds. One rainy night, his brother is shuffled into a van by unknown assailants, only to return 19 days later, having no memory of his disappearance. Jin-seok, however, begins to notice changes in his brother's behaviour. You know. Alarming ones. Enough for him to follow his brother out into the streets at night, and so on.The plot unravels from there, with time-tried things like scenes where Jin-seok approaches a door, while we see his feet, his fingers reaching for the doorknob, etc. This dates all the way back to thrillers like Hitchcock's ""Suspicion"" (1941), when Joan Fontaine wondered if Cary Grant was a murderer. Or a little like David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" (2014) for that matter.The movie is well-made as a genre exercise with touches of horror. Korean productions usually have a very Korean flavour, steeped in Korean sentiments (for lack of a better word), but this movie should be more «accessible» to an international audience. I'm not surprised it was picked up by Netflix, with little and easy dialogue, and a focus on a strong plot. And even if you know that there will be twists and turns, there should be something unexpected along the way.PS: The Korean title translates as something like ""The Night to Remember"" or ""Remember the Night"". It is definitely more fitting than the generic English title (""Forgotten"").PPS: A note on the touches of horror. One scene involves TV footage featuring US President Donald Trump (with Korean president Moon Jae-in). Sure looks like horror.",Forgotten

There are just too many scenes that are unreliable and mistakes made that even a human with half a brain wouldn't make.

The only Korean movie I had seen before this was Parasite, and even though I knew beforehand that this movie was not going to be as good as Parasite, I was seduced into expecting a fun and thrilling experience after reading some reviews. However, the experience ended up being rather confusing and very unsatisfying.The movie was introduced as a simple story about a family moving into a new home where a creepy adventure was waiting for them. To be honest, the first half of the movie was alright, the main character's brother was abducted while the both of them were out for a walk at 11:30 PM. He returned 19 days later but he couldn't remember anything. Also, there was a room in their new house which they were by any means not allowed to enter. The main character heard some loud noises coming out of this room so that was another huge mystery.The movie spent the second half of the movie revealing the mysteries and throwing in random plottwists that were supposed to astonish the audience. Whatever they were trying to do, I was not impressed. There was too much inexplicable drama and I am still trying to figure out why most of the plot happened.

Other then this point people stated that ending was poorly done, which I once again have to disagree with. It was obvious that once the two main characters both learned the truth about their past it caused so much pain to the point of them taking their own life soon after.

176,fraudreizehn,An amazing thriller,9,22 February 2018,"Korean cinema in recent years has been ahead of many other countries on the continent, such as Japan, without giving us much time to assimilate it. ""Forgotten"" is one of the most recent examples of why this evolution has taken place and why many of us are delighted with this type of cinema.
The film focuses on the life of a boy who tries to discover the truth behind the kidnapping of his older brother, who returns as a different man after nineteen days of captivity, from which he claims to remember nothing.
A film that mixes the psychological thriller with touches of atmospheric terror and plays excellently with the shadows and paranoia of the younger brother during the days of the disappearance. Jang Hang-jun, responsible for the script and direction, knows how to make us feel the anguish of the situation at all times, making the disinformation that we have as a spectator is the same as our protagonist and creating a situation where interest increases every minute that passes.
I must also emphasize the excellent performance of both brothers, especially that of the older brother (Kim Mu-Yeol), because he manages to create an insecurity and concern that does not disappear throughout the film. What's happened to him? That is the question that will haunt us at all time, as the film progresses, because the closer we get to its end, the more disoriented and surprised we will find ourselves, making us goose bumps and hitting us with an unsuspected but tremendous outcome.
But not only in the script we can check quality, because if we focus on the more technical sections, we will realize that both the sound and photography sections are really well constructed, being vital in the development of many of the scenes and giving an intensity to the set that is well above average. The mastery of rhythm and the steady pulse behind the camera of the whole team make ""Forgotten"" not just a thriller, but an example of what modern cinema should be like.
With' Forgotten', the lovers of the best thriller are in congratulations and the South Korean country claims its good state of form, because in recent years we have seen many examples of great calibre as 'I Saw The Devil', ' New World' or 'The Wailing' among others. Those who look for a good mystery, disturbing settings and stories with ingenious plot twists, should not miss this film.",Forgotten

186,Rukaa,I have no idea why this is so hyped up?,2,28 September 2019,"Okay so a lot of this 9/10 5 star reviews have one point of praise I can't refute: this movie does have so many twists and turn you wont know where it's going to end up. The red herrings are masterfully planted, and the build-up and execution of the super tense, fear inducing scenes involving the ~secret door~ are flawless. 10/10 thriller/horror cinematography. The places this story could have gone following that vein of directing and plot would have been phenomenal and, sure, a very different movie. And one I probably would have preferred.What the hell was the ending, though? After the truly bizarre climatic 'twist reveal' which begged more suspension of disbelief than the wildest theories of doppelgangers and ghosts ever could, it kind of just...kept going downhill. I'm trying to not be too hyperbolic, but I think I'm really upset because this film had SUCH a good start and SUCH a promising premise. The execution was brilliant throughout, I won't lie. Acting? flawless. Camerawork? Brilliant.But come on! I can't forgive a plotline that relies purely on a narrative that takes place in a vacuum where... the rest of the world doesn't exist, I guess. Well, not sensibly at least. The police and hospital workers are apparently completely incompetent and dismissive (I can forgive that to an extent, but when a very confused man covered in blood stumbles into a police station, surely no one would just laugh him back out?) and the main characters behaviour at the end once he knows the truth and can clear the air somewhat decides to maintain the confusion? Why?Why why why? It's like the idea for the climax came first, a great build up was written, and then they couldn't figure out how to resolve it in a way that justified how straight-up whack the situation had gotten. An unreliable narrator and traumatised nihilism doth not a satisfying resolution make. The ending was so ridiculously out there, trying way too hard to be clever and cool, that it just fell flat. What's saddest, though, is it might have actually worked if they hadn't drowned the clever simplicity in so much extra detail to 'throw-off' the viewer along the way.",Forgotten

The movie is enjoyable and does a good job of keeping you on edge for most of it´s duration.The only reason why I deduced 3 stars is because I feel like after the first half of the movie some plot points become predictable and the movie looses a bit of it´s original charm. I also feel like the movie could use a bit more of the ""show not tell"" technique and that the final scene was a bit unecessary.

195,napnik-38086,Very good and has a good twist,8,25 November 2020,"This movie is an investigative and mysterious thriller in South Korea, a thrilling and addictive thriller. The story begins with the protagonist moving into a new home with a family made up of parents, older brothers, and the hero himself. After they entered the house, they discovered that there was a room that was strictly forbidden, arguing that the former owner charged and asked for help to keep things first. Even though he tried to enter, he was always barred. But he himself had a strange feeling of familiarity with this house, as if shared memories He felt that there was something wrong in that room and wanted to know the truth. From a small suspicion, the hero wants to find out the truth, including the hero who has no memory of his family and his brother has been kidnapped, and after a dozen days of disappearance, his brother returns. But himself felt that his brother had changed into a quest for the truth. At first we feel a little horror movie, then the movie starts showing you confused by the story. Then the main character Might be hallucinating yourself? Think yourself about the whole event because of hallucination?

The overall plot of the movie is interesting, sadly the screenwriters did a bad job sowing this story together to become a great movie. It's like they
had a couple of ""cool"" movie twist ideas that they forced into the plot, without a thought about how the overall story would be affected by it. The story didd't need all the complexity that it has.
