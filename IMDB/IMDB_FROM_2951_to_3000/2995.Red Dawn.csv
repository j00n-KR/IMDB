0,bkoganbing,Wolverines ride again,4,14 April 2013,"Ending on a far more positive note that the first Red Dawn, this updated 21st century adaption of that Cold War classic has the USA invaded by North Korea and of course with help from Russia. Interesting how the film was made in 2009 and shelved for two years while we changed the villains from Chinese to North Korean because we have to think of that big Chinese market. That's capitalism at its finest.Geopolitically it doesn't make much sense either. The Russians if anything have become super nationalist with the Russian Orthodox Church having more power than they did with the Czars. I doubt they would be helping the government of the still true believers in Revolution. Ditto the Chinese. Back in the day I remember when one did not refer to mainland China without the prefix Red attached to it. But about 30 seconds after Mao Tse-tung could not fog a mirror the revolution was over in China and not a moment too soon. Those who survived Mao's Red Guards could testify to that. Now they're as capitalist as we are with certain lip service paid to Mao just like in Russia lip service to the ideals of Lenin.What these two did do after the fall of the Soviet Union which kept North Korea alive is say you're on your own Kim family and the little family enterprise you call a country. Like Prussia, it's a state that supports an army because if you don't join the army, you and your family might starve. And now they can't feed their people, but they can build their own nukes to threaten all around who enjoy prosperity. That's all of their neighbors.The recent saber rattling of North Korea has given some credence to the popularity of this film as it did in the recent Olympus has fallen. The North Koreans invade, thousands of paratroopers over the Pacific rim and we're told that Russians are in the East Coast. They declared cyber warfare by screwing up our military defense systems and invaded.And like the first version some high school kids fight the invaders and they call themselves Wolverines after their football team. The Wolverine which ironically is an endangered species is one fierce animal that never gives up and will take on a bigger foe and win.Unlike the first version the kids are lucky enough to have Chris Hemsworth who was in Iraq to train them. Hemsworth's brother is Josh Peck and they gather a crew together and reek havoc on the occupiers. The action is also located in the Pacific Northwest and the Wolverines do some urban guerrilla warfare. The original story had the kids living and doing their thing in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming.In the original which I liked more than this both Patrick Swayze and C. Thomas Howell were killed and the story had an Ishmael like ending with one Wolverine surviving to tell the tale of the kids who fought back while America regrouped to reclaim itself. This one ended on a more upbeat, but false note.Then again it was a far wackier premise with this plot than with the other version.",Red Dawn
1,Leofwine_draca,"Good action direction, but...",4,22 July 2015,"RED DAWN is the remake of an '80s film with the same title which saw America being invaded by Russia and a group of teenagers becoming mercenaries to drive the invaders out. It was a wish-fulfilment fantasy, one which hasn't dated too well, so this rework sees the Russians replaced by North Koreans, although otherwise the storyline is much the same.Unfortunately RED DAWN has some huge problems which scupper it from the outset. Credibility is one thing - the film never gets over the problem that North Korea would never have the resources to launch an invasion like this - but the main problem lies with the characters. In a word, they're horrible. The producers have picked the most unappealing young actors of the modern generation (I'm talking about you, Josh Hutcherson) and given them scenes in which they're completely out of their depth. It hurts when the best and most veteran actor is Chris Hemsworth, a guy who would be merely average in any other movie.It's a pity that the lack of decent characters had me hating this, because there's good stuff here. First-time director Dan Bradley is best known for his work as a stunt co-ordinator and yet he does a decent job here, particularly when it comes to crafting the superior action sequences. The use of CGI is very effective, and that early scene with the parachutes coming in is completely chilling. What a shame, then, that the action is wasted in such an insipidly-cast and predictable movie.",Red Dawn
2,SnoopyStyle,New history of Chinese Financing,4,26 August 2013,"This is a remake of the campy 80s classic. It stars Chris Hemsworth , Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, and Connor Cruise. There's nothing the actors could do to save this ridiculously illogical story.Whereas the original had the US invaded by Russia and Latin America, this one is invaded by North Korea. At least the 80s version passed the smell test. This one is just too stupid. Originally, this 2012 version was supposed to be Chinese which actually had a chance. But the change is the new history of Hollywood financing. This movie was held up in editing hell. The Chinese money didn't like to be shown as the bad guys. So a painstaking re-editing changed all the Chinese soldiers into North Koreans.As for the story, it's still basically the same idea. Except this time there is some kind of fantastical briefcase that explains the success of the foreign invaders. It just adds another element of disbelief into the movie. I like most of the actors in this, but there are too many unreasonable things to buy into.",Red Dawn
3,Prismark10,Red peril,2,24 July 2015,"Apparently North Korea is so poor that people in the countryside have to eat grass to survive. Not that you will gather from this film. North Korea invades the USA with CGI planes and CGI paratroopers who somehow have flown from the Far East in huge numbers and aim to run American better.We see evidence of this later in the film because the Subway is run so efficiently. Of course when the scriptwriter said the North Koreans will run the subway efficiently he meant the one with trains, the Director thought of the well known chain of sandwich shops!Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) is the hot headed football player of the Wolverine college team. His older brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) has just returned from active duty in Iraq. Together they and a band of friends head out to the woods and launch guerrilla warfare against the North Koreans who are being aided by the Russians.Josh Peck despite his acting appearances in the kids show Drake and Josh is awful. To think Josh Hutcherson has a minor role as a sidekick when he should had been the lead. Then again it does not help that the character of Matt is a jerk going around moping for his girlfriend and putting the lives of others at risk.The film is just bad, its ineptly made. It would be something if a character equated the shock & awe of the North Koreans to the events of the US army in the middle east so it could at least have claim to be some sort of parody.This is a remake of a cult film from 1984 which itself was no great shakes. Only the fact that there was some decent action sequences in the latter part of the movies saves it from a total bomb rating.",Red Dawn
4,claudio_carvalho,"Exacerbated Patriotism, but Watchable and Entertaining",5,17 August 2013,"In Spokane, Washington, the population is awake by a North Koran invasion with paratroopers. The marine Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) and his brother Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) escape with a group of friends to an isolated cabin in the woods. They witness the cruel Captain Cho (Will Yun Lee) executing their father and they decide to form a resistance group named Wolverines fighting against the invaders.In 1984, ""Red Dawn"" was a cult movie for people of my generation. This contemporary remake is dumb, with exacerbated patriotism and funny lines. I laughed a lot when Jed explains that the invasion of Iraq was right since they were the ""good guys"", but the invasion of his country is an absurd since the invaders are the ""bad guys"". But forgetting this type of blunder, the action is watchable and entertaining. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Amanhecer Violento"" (""Violent Dawn"")",Red Dawn
5,nogodnomasters,OVER? WAS IT OVER WHEN THE KOREANS TOOK OVER SPOKANE?,4,29 May 2019,"The original film was the darling of second amendment advocates. Without a well armed civilian population, the Red Army would march in and take over. While as improbable the original script or corny the lines, there was a group of young up and coming actors that were able to deliver those lines and make us feel them.In this film....the North Koreans? The same North Koreans who couldn't conquer South Korea and it was a small country right next door to them? These guys couldn't find their own butt with both hands and a map, but have been able to conquer a nation with a huge land mass and a modern military, with allies that would actually fight for us. So the scenario has gone from very improbable, to seriously? The same guys who shot missiles in spirals? We could conquer N. Korea after breakfast and be home for lunch.At this point I had to remove my brain from my head to watch the film.This film was updated to reflect the changes in the audience which demands more action and special effects at the cost of silly things like creating characters or drama.Armed with some C-4 that happened to be lying around, Jed (Chris Hemsworth) leads a group of teens against the Red Army because somehow our entire arm forces stationed in over 100 nations and all the ships at sea are too busy fighting some electronic jamming EMF thing. In one scene Robert (Josh Hutcherson) risks everyone's life to rescue the pretty blond Erica (Isabel Lucas) and still can't score.With an inane script, you need good actors who can bring it to life. This one didn't have it. In fact it bordered on campy considering it was NORTH KOREA! The film ended rather abruptly after a brief ""patriotic"" message...""This is our home."" Older generations who saw the original, might want to catch this later as a cheap rental...or not. Not as good as Expendables 2. This is a good film to pretend you want to see really bad, but your girlfriend doesn't want to see it. You then make the ""big sacrifice"" and watch ""Twilight"" with her which should lead to....Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb, no sex or nudity. The city is suppose to be Spokane, but it was filmed mostly in Michigan. The army was originally Chinese, but it was changed so not to insult the Chinese. Now the film could be shown in their market. How comes I feel like we already lost without firing a shot? I can sleep better at night knowing Chris Hemsworth and Patrick Swayze with their constitution right to bear arms are out there protecting me.",Red Dawn
6,kosmasp,Action is decent,3,19 May 2013,"And that is about the best thing that can be said, about this Remake. OK, the actors are good looking too, but it's up to you to decide if you want to honor the casting people. And they just did more or less, what the original did. Took some ""hot"" names and put them together in a movie. It's not the fault of the actors though, that the movie could not live up to the original (which did not age well itself).Even though you sort of get a new villain (sort of, ""instead"" of Russia) and one that is personified, it doesn't really touch you. The plot just doesn't fly. There are more holes here than in swiss cheese. It tries hard to explain things, which often times makes them even more ridiculous. Even the original knew better than that. Of course the action is updated as mentioned above, but is that enough for the lack of passion and the obnoxious use of the ""piece symbol"" (with fingers)? You have to answer that one yourself. Characters are not consistent and overall it's too ""smooth"" for its own good",Red Dawn
7,Coventry,Quarterback G. I. Joe  The REAL American Hero!,1,4 January 2016,"I really ought to re-watch the original 1984 version of ""Red Dawn"" again, even if it were only to see if that one annoys me just as much as the remake does. I saw the original already, but it must have been nearly 20 years ago or something, and back then my standards for plausible plots and misplaced patriotism must have been set a lot lower. The only things I remember from the 1984 ""Red Dawn"" are awesome action sequences and performances from the utterly cool Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen. The 2012 version has pretty much the same plot, except that the evil Soviets have been replaced by evil North Koreans for obvious political reasons. I can imagine how that brainstorming session at United Artists headquarters must have gone: ""Let's take North Koreans as the opponents. We don't know anything about them except that they are not allowed to watch American movies on television, so they'll never find out anyways"" The ""Red Dawn"" movies have the most implausible and ridiculous plots imaginable, but only like this they can shamelessly glorify the true American patriotism! History has made it unmistakably clear that warfare through ground troops invasions are guaranteed suicide missions. If you want to claim another nation as your own, you drop bombs – preferably nuclear ones – from planes. Those awful North Koreans clearly didn't learn anything from Napoleon's or even Adolf Hitler's defeats and nevertheless decide to invade America's heartland by dropping thousands of soldiers with parachutes. In Spokane, a sleepy little Washington State town, a handful of teenagers fight back. They call themselves the Wolverines and exist of the two Eckert brothers and their girlfriends, the mayor's son, the town nerd and a few other members of the football team. The self-acclaimed leader is a former mariner, so I can still accept his killer instincts, but the other teenagers' transformation from regular American kids into relentless military killing machines by far surpasses my suspension of disbelief. All the American born actors with distant Asian roots (Will Yun Lee, Steven Chan, Cindy Chu) must have been desperate for work and the tagline ""Heroes are made in America"" nearly makes me nauseous.",Red Dawn
8,michaelRokeefe,Home of the brave and braver.,5,4 April 2014,"This movie is actually based on the 1984 film, of the same name, starring Patrick Swaze and C. Thomas Howell. The whole story centers around a group of young people more than willing to defend their hometown from a North Korean invasion. The mainland is vulnerable due to increased deployment of American troops abroad. After a mysterious power outage in Spokane, Washington a young Marine,Jed Eckert(Chris Hemsworth), home on leave, and his brother Matt(Josh Peck)awaken to swarms of North Korean paratroopers and transport aircraft. The brothers are joined by other friends at the family cabin in the woods. The group of young people are anxious and fearful, but must come to a decision to surrender to the invaders or try and fight the good fight defending their families, friends and hometown. After acquiring various weapons, the small group of teen defenders carry out guerrilla attacks against the obviously better prepared North Korean troops. But as you know, might doesn't always determine the winner of the fight.Prepare for sequences of intense war violence that is accompanied by very strong language and disturbing images. RED DAWN is directed by Dan Bradley and has a supporting cast featuring: Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, Edwin Hodge, Will Yun Lee, Fernando Chien and Alyssa Diaz.",Red Dawn
9,Theo Robertson,""" North Korea ? It Doesn't Make Sense "" - You're Not Wrong",4,19 June 2013,"This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset Some people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea John Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure . One of the protagonists is a former veteran of the Iraqi conflict and leading the band of guerrilla fighters he makes the point "" When I was abroad we were the good guys because we brought order . Now we're the bad guys because we bring chaos "" I fail see the thinking behind this . Order=good , chaos = bad ? How is that then ? Surely it should be democracy good , tyranny bad ? If you're expecting any profound discussion about the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter you're watching the wrong film because the remake of RED DAWN is more concerned about setting up action packed set-pieces where brave Americans kill nasty Asiatic commies Even then the action scenes collapse when you give them any thought . Don't the North Korean soldiers have things like road blocks where anyone passes through has to be searched for weapons ? There's also a lack of internal continuity . You can guarantee that when the script demands it there's literally thousands of NKs patrolling the streets of the city then when the guerrillas launch an attack there's only a handful of North Koreans who are cannon fodder , then the good guys are back in their camp safe and sound . Why didn't the thousands of communists just head them off in the pass ? The original film was bad enough but this one is worse . You can perhaps say this remake has better action scenes but for an action scene to successfully work then there has to still an element of credibility involved and everything about this film lacks any credible element and feels anachronistic in any point it might be making . Indeed in the 1980s American control was criticised in case America became a target of foreign invasion . Try claiming people should be allowed access to guns in case of a sneak attack by North Korea and listen to the laughter",Red Dawn
10,LeonLouisRicci,No Adrenaline Shot Here,1,24 April 2013,"It is remotely possible that this one had back funding from the NRA and Fox News with maybe some other financial support from Subway, Rolling Rock, and Dick Cheney. It is an awful Right-Wing Movie with more clichés and stupid stuff than imaginable. The Acting ranges from mumbling to staring. The battle scenes are laughable and sub-par even for CGI. A Politician, the Mayor, is Black and of course in Cheney-la-la-land, somewhere near Birtherville, he becomes a Defector. The parallel is obvious.We have a Man-Thing where the Highs School Quarterback is given his first Beer and Gun. As for the Females in the ""Militia"" they look spiffy in the cave hideout, still sporting some blow dry, lipstick, and cleavage. But they do chip in yielding some heavy ordinance and are known affectionately as ""The Girls"". No adrenaline shot here, it is just too flat and badly handled to inspire much Patriotism even though there are a few speeches that try. ""This is our home""...""this is our back yard"". But, hold on, in the badly thought out opening scene of this misfire, at the Football Game, the Home Team lost.",Red Dawn
11,zardoz-13,"The ""Red Dawn"" Remake Surpasses the Original!!!",9,23 November 2012,"Although I ranked the original ""Red Dawn"" (1984) as a vintage Reagan-era action opus, freshman director Don Bradley's supercharged, high-octane, remake starring Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, and Josh Hutcherson surpasses its predecessor on several counts. The first ""Red Dawn"" depicted a Soviet invasion of a small Colorado town and the scrappy squad of high school teens who eventually ousted them with their hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. Patrick Swayze starred in the original, and Charlie Sheen made his cinematic debut. Anti-Communist, Cold War movies enjoyed a brief renaissance when ""Red Dawn"" came out. Clint Eastwood's ""Firefox"" (1982) about a washed-up Vietnam pilot who stole a top-secret Soviet stealth jet fighter represented a standard example of these films. Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky IV"" (1985) appeared a year after ""Red Dawn"" with the Italian Stallion swapping blows with a gigantic Soviet pugilist. Meanwhile, James Bond had tangled with cunning Soviets in both ""For Your Eyes Only"" (1981) and ""Octopussy"" (1983). The Soviets qualified as despicable B-movie villains, but the Americans defeated them despite any handicaps. The last gasp of this sub-genre occurred during the 1980s, particularly after the bottom dropped out of the Evil Empire in 1989. Comparatively, while Milius' ""Red Dawn"" unfolded largely in a rural setting, the agile remake occurs in the urban setting of Spokane, Washington. Bradley and scenarists Carl Ellsworth of ""Disturbia"" and Jeremy Passmore of ""Special"" haven't departed drastically from the original screenplay that Kevin Reynolds of ""Waterworld"" and John Milius of ""Flight of the Intruder"" penned. Whereas the original concluded with the defeat of the enemy and the end of World War III, the ""Red Dawn"" remake leaves the outcome of the action up in the air. This remake is not as enigmatic about the fate of its protagonist.Chris Hemsworth of ""Thor"" plays battle seasoned Marine Jed Eckert who comes home to Spokane after his tour of duty. It seems Jed ran out not only on his father, Spokane Police Sergeant Tom Eckert (Brent Cullen), but also his impressionable younger brother Matt (Josh Peck of ""Drillbit Taylor"") and left no messages. Not long after Jed arrives home, the unexpected happens. Enemy cargo planes crowd the sky, and paratroopers appear like a blizzard of snowflakes. Jed, Matt, and their friend Robert (Josh Hutcherson of ""The Hunger Games"") scramble for the safety of the family cabin in the woods. Along the way, they pick up several others as they flee from the besieged city during a harrowing auto chase with the North Koreans in furious pursuit. Eventually, Jed trains these teens from the bootstraps up into a lethal band of guerrillas. Soon they become the bane of the North Koreans. Everywhere our heroes go and devastate the North Koreans, they spray-paint wolverines on the walls. Wolverines are the name of their high school football team. No matter how fiercely North Korean District Leader Captain Cho (Will Yun Lee of ""Die Another Day"") pursues them, Jed and company elude him at every turn. One day our heroes join forces with three Marines dispatched to contact them. Helicopter pilot Colonel Andy Tanner (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of ""The Losers"") and his two men explain they have been ordered to retrieve a top-secret communications unit that the enemy uses to safeguard its chain of command. Jed and Matt clash when Matt takes advantage of an opportunity to rescue his girlfriend, Erica Martin (Isabel Lucas of ""Immortals""), from a prison bus during a major tactical exercise. One of them dies because Matt goes rogue on the Wolverines. Before long the North Korean bring in an imposing Russian military adviser who devises a way to track the Wolverines back to their lair. Jed and Matt square off against each other about Matt's irresponsible attitude. Eventually, the two reach reconciliation before the North Koreans descend on them without warning.One of the biggest criticisms about ""Red Dawn"" (1984) was its far-fetched premise. A Soviet airborne invasion seemed dubious initially, and it seems even more implausible in the remake. The Soviet Union emerged as our chief nemesis from the end of World War II and remained so until 1989. Pitting a faction of fresh-faced kids against the Soviets isn't nearly as improbable as pitting them against the North Koreans. Mind you, nobody considers the North Koreans a serious threat compared with either Russia or China. One of the strengths of the ""Red Dawn"" remake, however, is the way it makes the events that precipitate World War III seem credible. Nevertheless, casting the North Koreans as our adversary remains lamentable. Originally, the filmmakers cast the Red Chinese as our adversary. Afterward, the studio changed their minds because China imports Hollywood's product. Consequently, the studio kept ""Red Dawn"" on the shelf for three years while they digitally altered the uniforms, insignia, and identity of the invading army. Bradley and his writers make us abhor the North Koreans and cheer for the underdog heroes. Freshman director Don Bradley, who supervised the stunts on ""The Bourne"" movies as well as ""Spider-man 2"" and ""Spider-man 3,""stages the combat sequences with vigorous aplomb. The teens look credible enough wielding some impressive firepower. Bradley doesn't waste time either. This ""Red Dawn"" clocks in considerably shorter than the Milius original. Some of the dialogue sounds quotable, particularly the remark about Marines regrouping in Hell. Altogether, ""Red Dawn"" qualifies as another of those few remakes that overshadows the original.",Red Dawn
12,neil-476,No better than average,6,22 March 2013,"There was me watching the news and thinking that the problem with North Korea is that there is a nutjob with a nuke in charge. Turns out I was wrong: according to Red Dawn, he's a nutjob with an invasion (or should I say ""invasian"") force, which is why the inhabitants of Spokane are surprised to wake up to find hordes of oriental paratroopers raining down on them. The only ones who escape the round-up are assorted very old-looking teenagers and a big brother who is a marine home on leave. They fight back with a view to becoming a focal resistance movement.Red Dawn (2013) is a remake of Red Dawn (1984), in which the invasion force was Russian and Patrick Swayze played the older brother. I have never seen that original version, so I only have this version to consider in isolation, so no comparisons here.It's OK at best. There is some tolerable action, Chris Hemsworth has commanding screen presence, and there was one very effective shock moment.On the other side, it doesn't bear close examination (it is absolutely littered with unanswered questions and things which don't make sense), there is little individuality among the resistance group even though they are so few, and Josh Peck as the younger brother (and the intended audience identification figure) is absolutely awful.After two hours, you may well be tossing a coin to decide if you wasted your time or not.",Red Dawn
13,anaconda-40658,What a Piece of Crap.,1,26 November 2015,"Red Dawn (2012): Dir: Dan Bradley / Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, Adrienne Palicki, Isabel Lucas: Unbearably dull piece of dirt about the emerging of evil. Perhaps that can describe the fact the studios heaped this remake on us without a bit of warning of how bile it is. We have North Korean soldiers landing in America for a takeover that must have had even the biggest of comedians rolling in the aisles with laughter. Then we have Chris Hemsworth as a soldier returning from active duty who trains a group of snot nose kids who have all the believability of the characters in the Peanuts comics. After seeing their policeman father shot from a distance, they form a laughable group called the Wolverines. For the length of time it takes Hemsworth to train these idiots to fight like soldiers, I could have had a quick sh*t. None of this makes any sense and director Dan Bradley is no help either. We are subjected to action scenes that couldn't be any worse than if they were reenacted as a skit on Saturday Night Live. Hemsworth gives lame speeches about patriotism, while his brother, played by Josh Peck basically whines and pouts. The selfish brat rescues his chained girlfriend on a bus but doesn't seem to care about the other prisoners. Josh Hutcherson plays a wussy tech kid, and Adrienne Palicki plays Hemworth's new lady who trains really quick. Isabel Lucas plays Peck's girlfriend whom he risks his neck freeing while leaving everyone else on the bus. Easily one of the worst films of the year and it should be taken to a remote region, strapped to a bomb and blown up. Score: 1 / 10",Red Dawn
14,FlashCallahan,Red Yawn......,1,7 March 2013,"The first time around, it wasn't the best eighties movie in the world, but it had a great cast, and it was fun for what it was.Take this remake, probably the worst remake I've seen in a very long time, and you realise the only reason this has seen the inside of a movie theatre is because of Thor, Avengers Assemble, and The Hunger Games, no other reason what so ever.This time, the North Koreans have invaded, and the character from Die Another Die is trying to take over whatever.The worst thing he can do is kill Thors dad, not only will this vex the 'Wolverines', it gets rid of the best actor in the film very early on.But the biggest problem is the fact that the heroes rarely seem in danger, from the first encounter, the N. Koreans just stand there and watch them drive about and look perplexed, and the res too the film the heroes just blow up stuff and argue.Toward the end of the film Dean Morgan, the cut price George Clooney appears to give it Gravitas, but its too late, the film is ruined, as there is no real flow in narrative structure.It's the worst mainstream release I've seen since that awful RZA film with Crowe, and it really poisons your memory of a half decent eighties movie.A horrid, rancid, pointless movie, that the film company has released in a desperate attempt to make a little money on the basis that two stars are quite big now.It fails, miserably.",Red Dawn
15,phd_travel,Deserved to flop - childish and cheap,1,12 July 2013,The story comes across as amateurish and childish - not to mention ludicrous and politically incorrect. An unnecessary movie to remake. At least in the Swayze version there was a cold war going on. North Koreans have so many problems of their own eg enough food to eat they are hardly going to mount a parachute attack on suburban Pacific Northwest. Most of it felt like paintball in the woods.The cast is bad. Josh Peck and Chris Hemsworth as brothers? Josh looked really daft and his character was so annoying. Chris doesn't look good with a crew cut - in fact it makes him look like an overweight redneck. The ladies Isabel and Adrianne looked like they would rather be elsewhere. Poor Will Yun Lee - his biggest role in this drivel.In fact the audience would all be better of being elsewhere than watching this.,Red Dawn
16,mm-39,Better than the original!,8,26 November 2012,"Better story than the original! The makers watched the old movie then modernized and improved Red Dawn. I love how the Hemsworth's character drives the storyline. The in-between deployments marine understands military tactics and how to create an insurgency. Red Dawn unfolds how a military take-over would work. During the take-over, there are two types of people, those who collaborate and the ones who fight! There is an inside joke about the deer blood! (will not say more) The remake has a better storyline where the insurgences have a goal. The ending with the passing of the torch is memorable. I give Red Dawn an eight out of ten. Nice to see a remake which is well done. The remake is not another rip off using a movie classic's name.",Red Dawn
17,StevePulaski,"Us damn Yanks, right?",5,24 November 2012,"Red Dawn is probably the only remake in the history of film that sports a title that is less relevant to its subject matter than when it was originally used. I get it; red represents communism, but never have I heard North Koreans be called ""reds"" like the Soviet Union. China would've been more plausible, but when the filmmakers attempted to make the Chinese the invaders in this remake, they were outraged that a country they assisted for so long would go back and demonize them in a piece of patriotic propaganda. This spectacle makes me seriously wonder how we Americans are portrayed in foreign cinema.If it's anything like how we've portrayed foreigners in our cinema, I would anticipate nothing but caricatures filled with enough greed and bigotry for an entire country. But back to the film at hand; Red Dawn is just what you'd expect of a film that remakes the 1984 film. The original film's values have been decreased to nothing more than a cult hit depicting one man's ""what if?"" thought stretched into a near two hour film. Here, we are greeted with more incredulity, soullessness, tiresome action sequences, and redundant explosions than in the first film, but we are robbed of the pleasant appearances of actors like Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, and Powers Boothe.The film revolves around the town of Spokane, Washington, where Jed Eckhert (Chris Hemsworth), who served as a Marine for six years after the death of his mother, returns home to greet his father and football star brother Matt (Josh Peck), only to be disturbed by a power outage the same night Matt loses a big game. They awake in the morning to find North Korean paratroopers dropping to the ground and F-16s hurling through the sky, and quickly pursue their pickup truck to round up their teen neighbors, Robert (Josh Hutcherson) and Daryl (Connor Cruise) and proceed to hide out in a remote mountainous cabin that just so happens to shelter days worth of bullets, food, and other supplies just in case them North Koreans decide to drop in.Washington soon turns into a battleground, and we learn from seconds of disjointed news footage that the United States government has lost all control of their country. Koreans have detained citizens, constructed concentration camps with large signs reading ""YOU DESERVE TO BE HERE"" rather quickly, have shot hundreds of innocent people, destroyed a number of buildings, and have begun establishing new world order, calling out corruption and greed as the United States' reason for failing (also stating they're the ones who will help us). Isn't it nice to have a leader tell you your country's system has failed as him and his men have done us the kindness of dropping onto our soil and killing a number of innocent men and women, while trapping the ones they've let live in detainment camps? But ththeir ways are better and more fair than ours. Trust them.Whatever. It turns out Washington's fate rests in the hands of these brave teenagers, now calling themselves the ""Wolverines,"" after their high school football team, as they prepare themselves, retrain their reflexes, build bombs, and blow the hell out of a lot of Korean soldiers in an effort to take back their homeland. What I wondered throughout the whole picture was what the hell the Korean military was thinking and what they tried to accomplish by invading the U.S.? The Korean population is not even a fifth of the United States', and I doubt all their citizens are part of this militia, so why would they try to apprehend and attack a country so much larger than them, and what was their main goal? Imperialistic greed? That would be an act of hypocrisy towards their new policy they are trying to implement. What plan could possibly involve detaining citizens, killing them, blowing up buildings, and plastering their flag all over the country while reminding them they're there in the population's best interest? And do not get me started on the abundance of action sequences that are choppily edited, haphazardly choreographed, and pathetically compiled together trying to resemble something of a coherency timeline. Ever play a Call of Duty game? Join an online match, turn the volume all the way up, begin playing, and have someone shake the TV in the process and you got the action scenes in Red Dawn.Some will question whether or not this film improves over the 1984 cult hit and I will say in some cases it does. The tone is more serious and the invasion sequence is more suspenseful and a lot grittier than in the original picture. Both Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck have been in some great films (hell, what hasn't Hemsworth been in this year?), and this genre of guerrilla action has scarcely seen brighter days, but the remake of Red Dawn is just as redundant and as tedious as the original film, only at least the original film had a valid reason for existing.NOTE: I find it amusing how this film has gone so far under the radar in terms of controversy when Larry Charles' The Dictator (released this same year) had so much criticism reflecting off of it and all it was was a raunchy satire, no more crude and raucous than such works as The Hangover: Part II or Project X. Considering which one is more realistic, although they both pack an incredulous resume, I'd expect to see Americans speaking poorly about a Red Dawn remake in the modern day; not rushing to see it.NOTE II: Visit my blog to see an analysis of both Red Dawn films to see which one I feel is the better film, http://stevepulaski.blogspot.comStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, Connor Cruise, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

18,KineticSeoul,So dumb it's annoying,3,31 March 2013,"Now this is coming from a guy that didn't see the original. But this movie sucks, sure it has quite a bit of action. But everything about it is so dumb and doesn't make any sense to the point it gets annoying really quickly. The movie is about the North Korean army invading America with the help of other communist countries such as Russia. And a band of teens and one marine dude is trying to put a stop to them by destroying the North Korean army plans. So the high school teens and a marine dude create this freedom fighter team called the Wolverines. And constantly attack the North Korean army that invaded their turf. But this is done in a way where just about nothing makes sense and the invaders act like they want to be shot. Because they walk around like open targets when they know dangers all around them. Sure some movies have villains that make incompetent moves but this is just way way too much. It gets too much to the point it can even give you a headache. This might have worked as a video game but as a movie it fails. All the characters are underdeveloped and the comradeship is just so darn weak. I didn't care who lived or who died. Just pass on this one, unless you want to see a movie that annoys you. One of my co-worker said this movie looks so dumb when we first saw the trailer before the screening of ""Skyfall"" but what I didn't expect was how this flick takes the word dumb to another level.3/10",Red Dawn
19,Hellmant,It isn't really that much worse than the original but will never be as fondly loved or remembered.,6,8 December 2012,"'RED DAWN': Three Stars (Out of Five)Remake to the cult classic 1984 hit about the invasion of a small American town and a group of young people (mostly teenagers) looking to defend it. The original was about the invasion of America by the Soviet Union (and it's Nicaraguan and Cuban allies) and centered on a small Colorado town. It came at the height of the Cold War so it was very relevant and popular because of it. This remake (which was finished filming over two years ago and shelved due to the studio, MGM, having financial troubles) is about an American invasion by North Korea (and some Russian allies) and centers on the town Spokane, Washington. The film was originally about a Chinese invasion of America but scenes were re-shot and re-edited, while it was sitting in wait, due to China being offended and America wanting to keep their box office. The already unbelievable plot was made even more unrealistic by changing the invading army to a North Korean one (which is very small compared to the American Army) and makes no sense. The film spends little time trying to make sense though and is just a cheesy bad war film that is actually pretty faithful to the original.Chris Hemsworth was cast as the film's lead prior to playing 'Thor' (and was only known for a cameo in the 2009 'STAR TREK' reboot, playing George Kirk). He plays Jed (a role played by Patrick Swayze in the original), who is on leave from military duties in Afghanistan and has returned home to his family in Spokane unexpectedly. His brother, Matt (Josh Peck, playing a role previously played by Charlie Sheen), is a high school football star who just blew a big game. He's mad at Jed for suddenly leaving home after their mother died and is not happy to see him. The next morning (after Jed arrives) they both awake to find North Korean soldiers parachuting into the streets and taking over their town. Their father Tom Eckert (Brett Cullen), a local police sergeant, tells them to flee to their cabin in the woods (which is funny if you're a Chris Hemsworth fan). They take some other high schoolers with them. After witnessing their father being executed the boys decide to form a resistance force and call themselves 'The Wolverines', after their high school mascot. The rest of the film focuses on their rebellion against the North Korean Army. It co-stars Isabel Lucas, Adrianne Palicki and Josh Hutcherson (in a role previously played by C. Thomas Howell) as fellow resistance fighters. The film was directed by stunt man (and stunt coordinator) turned first time feature film director Dan Bradley. It was written by Carl Ellsworth (who co-wrote the thrillers 'RED EYE', 'DISTURBIA' and the 2009 remake of 'THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT') and Jeremy Passmore. The original was directed and co-written by the great John Milius. It was just as bad a film as this remake but it came at a time when it had a lot greater impact. Milius was a very talented director and writer and had a lot of fun with the 1984 hit but the filmmakers behind this one aren't too shabby either. Still the film is somewhat of a mess and kind of sloppy. What's going on is never very clear or how it's at all possible but the original was almost as unbelievable. The cast of the original was a little more impressive but Hemsworth is a good leading man and Isabel Lucas is gorgeous. If you compare the two this film isn't really that much worse but it still will never be as fondly loved or remembered as the original.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD9BHpPUnE8",Red Dawn
20,Robert_duder,They completely loss the essence of the original,5,2 March 2013,"First of all I will say as a huge movie fanatic, I am not opposed to remakes. I won't go into details why but I love seeing a good remake and there are plenty despite what some will say. I really wanted to like this. Even after hearing a lot of bad feedback, I really wanted to. I just didn't. It has a few plus sides but unfortunately it drags itself down and I place the blame almost entirely on a bad script. This particular version of the film does absolutely nothing to capture what Red Dawn was and is all about. The original film is a classic by many standards but it was in part due to the timely nature of the film when the Soviet Union was a threat and American patriotism and feeling immortal was at all time high. Nowadays, our tolerance for war is at an all time low and we don't feel so immortal anymore so the entire concept feels implausible. Part of that is because of the gaping plot holes that they chose to just skip over in the script or blow something else up in hopes that you ignore their horrendous errors in story telling. The biggest mistake almost immediately is that they do nothing to set up the characters in the film. In the original you became so attached to The Wolverines and their plights against the Soviets but everything happens so quickly in this film that you hardly know who anyone is and what their relationship is. They rush through everything so quickly that there is virtually no development at all and the pacing just feels off.The one thing that works in this film is the cast. Everyone does a truly great job especially when you consider what they are given to work with. I can't say a single negative thing about this cast except that we don't get more development out of their characters. Chris Hemsworth is perfect as the tough rugged marine in the right place at the wrong time. I think he has proved with this and Cabin In The Woods that he is much more than just Thor. Josh Peck really does steal scenes as the younger brother. He shows some great emotion and aside from his cheesy speech at the end he does a good job. Josh Hutcherson is mostly a background player in the film but he still does decently in his scenes. Given how popular he has become with Hunger Games, I'm surprised he didn't have a bigger role. Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas and Connor Cruise round out the main team as secondary supporting characters. They are quite good in their roles despite having such small parts. Other supporting cast members worth noting are Brett Cullen and Jeffrey Dean Morgan who are both remorsefully underused. Morgan's character is barely needed at all and once again he gets shafted in a bad/mediocre movie. I love the guy but he can't catch a break. Will Yun Lee looks the part of a super villain but he never really comes across as a true threat. He is given virtually no lines and there isn't really a climactic battle scene for him to show off his bad side.It almost makes me angry and shows just how little the producers cared about making this a good film when they choose a stuntman, with no prior directing experience to helm this movie. Dan Bradley clearly knows how to blow things up because there isn't anything wrong with the action sequences or special effects in the movie. The explosions are constant, all the time, non stop without any real purpose to further the story. Violence is mostly shown in the form of the aforementioned mass explosions and the camera conveniently makes sure you never see any single person shot in cold blood...and yet the movie is packed with coarse language as though that were better than showing violence which would actually play into the films themes. It was mildly entertaining thanks to a strong cast doing their utmost with a sub-par script, and some decent action scenes. I'm not comparing this to the original at all because it doesn't even hold a flame to it so it stands on its own as being marginally entertaining but only barely. It will have a hard time finding a demographic as the cast is too old for teenagers and the story is too ridiculous for adults. Watch the original, and also check out the superb Australian film ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" to see how this should have been done. 5.5/10",Red Dawn
21,bowmanblue,Pretty much what I expected,7,21 September 2014,"I have to confess... I missed the eighties original, so I can't compare this remake to its predecessor. However, I knew the story - America is invaded by a hostile force and its up to some good looking teens to turn into 'the resistance' and fight back.How much you enjoy this movie will depend on how much you can suspend your disbelief. The whole movie is pretty far-fetched from start to finish. If you can believe that America is that easy to overtake and that a small town seems to be of real importance to an invading force, then you can probably believe that the country's armed forces seem pretty powerless to do anything about it, leaving it to the kids to save the day.The transmission between ordinary high school kids and urban guerrillas is handled in a short montage soon after the invasion, showing us how they're now a considerable force to be reckoned with. However, this can probably be explained away by the fact that they are led by 'Thor' (also apparently known as Chris Hemsworth) who has a near indestructible pick-up truck. He gives them motivational speeches which make you want to thank your lucky stars that you live in a land of freedom.It's all pretty cheesy and, although I may be being a bit flippant about it all, I actually quite enjoyed it. There are some pretty intense and dramatic scenes, mainly involving the carnage the invasion brings.Ultimately, don't take it too seriously. It's daft, cheesy, over-the-top and desperately trying to get a sequel made, but if you can excuse and overlook its one hundred and one faults, then you might be able to get something out of it. At least it's short, so it won't take up too much of your time!",Red Dawn
22,g-bodyl,Unnecessary Remake!,6,17 April 2014,"The remake to the excellent 1984 John Milius action film is mediocre at best. It has some entertaining moments for sure, but this would have been better off not being remade. It is at its best when the action is going on, but at its worst during the build-up scenes. The premise of the film is preposterous, unlike the original film. Seriously, it's doubtful North Korea has the ability to overtake the United States. There are some serious flaws in the screenplay and that makes for cringe-worthy dialog at times, especially when they are trying to go patriotic.Dan Bradley's remake of Red Dawn is about a group of teenagers who form a military group called the Wolverines with the motive of fighting the invading North Koreans.The results of the acting is mixed, or at least that's what I believe. Chris Hemsworth does a great job here and I felt in line with his character. Adrianne Palicki also does a good job. Josh Hutcherson does okay, though he has done better. Josh Peck, however, is seriously miscast and does not belong in this film.Overall, this is a mediocre film at best and it's just one step of being a film with that dreaded failing grade. It's entertaining at times thanks to some well-crafted action scenes, but this film could use lessons in the dramatic department. It's much more believable in the original film. They should have never remade this film, but of course they have to do the same exact thing but in a more modern period with North Koreans to boot. Not an awful film, but not too good either. I rate this film 6/10.",Red Dawn

Then, under the codename: The Wolverines, they attack their occupier's defenses.But can the teenage insurgents withstand Korea's Communist co-conspirator who helped them take America off the electrical grid?

26,leonblackwood,Awful Remake! 2/10,2,13 July 2013,"Review: What a bad remake. The acting is terrible and there are way to many holes n the storyline. I got fed up with the amount of car crashes there are we're no one comes out with a scratch. Anyway, I think that the most annoying thing with this film has to be Hemsworth's brother who just seems to do one stupid thing after the other, and he just can't act. If it wasn't for Chris Hemsworth, I would have just switched he movie off because I just cringed all the way through it, especially the corny ending. Badly written, Badly performed and unrealistic action. Terrible!Round-Up: I was quite impressed with some of the CGI in the beginning, but that was the only good thing. I am surprised that they released a movie about South Korea taking over America because I would have thought that would be a touchy subject. Anyway, I can't really remember the Patrick Swayze version of this movie, but it can't be this bad. None of the kids have has army training, but the all end up like proper little Rambo's by the end of the movie. It also picked up a bit once Jeffrey Dean Morgan got introduced, but not that much.Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $45millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there pointless action movies, but don't expect anything amazing. 2/10",Red Dawn

28,Vartiainen,Boring remake,4,25 September 2016,"The United States gets invaded by North Korea. That pretty much sums up the ludicrousness of the film. I mean, the original had Soviet Union being the invading force, which at least played to the fears and politics of the time. This didn't have the guts to go with Russia - although they kinda did - but couldn't they haven chosen anything else but North Korea?Not that it really matters. The whole premise is silly, but so is the movie as a whole. And the worst thing is that it tries to take itself way too seriously. The tone is grim and dark, the characters suffer, there's death and dismemberment, the whole gruesome nine yards. And throughout this whole ordeal were supposed to believe that North Korea successfully invaded the only superpower of our time. Yeah... no.And the worst thing is that I've seen this idea done much better. I haven't seen the original film, but there's a film called Tomorrow, When the War Began, released a few years before this one, which takes place in Australia and has China as the invading force. Well, they don't explicitly specify the nation. But it's China. And yes, it's a stupid, silly film as well, but it acknowledges it. It's a teenage action-comedy and has much greater camp value because of it. The main characters are teenagers, like in this film, but the ludicrousness of the situation is turned to the film's advantage through decent writing and characters. And it still gets to have its guns akimbo action scenes and character deaths needed to sell the point that war is not actually such a hot idea.So, to summarize, if the premise interests you, see Tomorrow, When the War Began instead.

Thus, the idea to bring the remake's events into present day was the first misjudgment. And the cast - several cute faces with the aim to bring young people into the cinemas, but no catchy characters (Chris Hemsworth, for example, is rather overrated actor, but I can imagine his popularity among a certain audience) and their unlike development (party chicks and dudes would never become skilled fighters within weeks). The ending is dull as well. The strongest part of the movie are visually effective fight and burst scenes.Luckily, the movie is less than 1,5 hours...

In my opinion this film is just simply a waste of time cash grab. This film starts with north Korea invading the united states and Chris hemsworth plus the other lot of characters have to rise up to fight it by becoming the wolverines. The premise is quote cool if this film was made as a serious film but of course this film is just a mindless action film with lots of weaknesses. First of all the plot is ridiculous, where is the united states or allies military the reason they gave was so forced that people would just forget bout it but I cannot because I thought this film may actually have a sense of logic in it. You will not care about anybody in this film even Chris hemsworths character is weak and as things are meant to be emotional they clearly are not in my eyes. The idea of the country invasion could have been cool but they barely go into it to favour mindless action and explosions. Now I can find mindless action films fun but this film had more potential then that and could have hit at larger themes. Now there are some good montages of training which I do like and some of the actions cool but the end is so sudden and like we're setting up for a sequel please god no.",Red Dawn

We're gonna keep fighting cause it's easier now and we're used to it.¨I agree that this was a totally unnecessary remake and that the plot is beyond ridiculous, but I still had a decent time with Red Dawn as long as I didn't try to think too much about the unbelievable scenario. The real reason why this movie failed is because they took the ridiculous plot way too seriously when they should have played with the concept a little. A much lighter and playful approach would have made this film work. I really don't understand why the producers thought a remake like this would be a good idea considering the original film wasn't all that great either. I think it's about time the film industry begins taking bigger risks instead of recycling the same material over and over again and only adding new faces and better visual effects. This version of Red Dawn was directed by Dan Bradley who is known mostly for his work as a stunt coordinator in big budget films like the Spider Man and Bourne franchises. This was his directorial debut and of course it has several flaws and a rather terrible and unsatisfying ending, but it still managed to maintain my interest throughout most of the film. It was adapted from Kevin Reynolds's story of the 1984 film by Carl Ellsworth (Disturbia and Red Eye) and Jeremy Passmore, but their script wasn't much brighter. I think that if the film didn't take itself so seriously and played more with the ridiculousness of it all then it could have been much better. It never ended up embracing the absurdity of it all. The original Red Dawn dealt with the invasion of Soviets, but since we are in different times this time the enemy is North Korea. The story is very fictional and you have to be very imaginative in order to go along with the entire situation. The story takes place in a small American town in Washington while the local High school team has suffered a defeat under the leadership of its star quarterback, Matt Eckert (Josh Peck), while his father Tom (Brett Cullen) and older brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) watch from the sidelines. Despite the loss, his girlfriend Erica (Isabel Lucas) manages to lift his spirit and they all go out to celebrate at the local bar until they are interrupted by a blackout. Everything changes the next morning when a swarm of North Korean soldiers come parachuting down several jet planes and begin taking everyone hostage. Jed, who has recently returned from his service in Iraq, manages to escape along with his brother and several other friends to the woods. Together they decide to fight back the invaders and disrupt their plans. The young kids form a revolutionary group and call themselves the Wolverines, like the school mascot. Josh Hutcherson, Adrianne Palicki, and Connor Cruise all form part of the rebellious group that is led by Jed. It is impossible for a group of young teenagers to take down such a big military force, but somehow they manage to create chaos and inspire the rest of the American citizens to fight back.The film was shot in 2009 but due to some production problems it was finally released last year. I don't think they should have gone with all that trouble because the outcome wasn't really satisfying although the recent fame of Chris Hemsworth (Thor and The Avengers) and Josh Hutcherson (Hunger Games) may have helped the box office. Hutcherson who worked with Hemsworth's brother, Liam, in The Hunger Games doesn't really have an important role he. The true stars of the film are Chris and Josh Peck (from the Josh and Drake show) although there really wasn't a strong performance in all the film. It's hard to believe the actors when the script is pretty much unbelievable. The entire film feels like watching a couple of friends play Modern Warfare. The film could have worked better as a television miniseries or something like that, but as a two hour film everything felt way out of place.

36,kluseba,A propaganda movie,5,12 January 2013,"""Red Dawn"" is a lukewarm remake of a classic with an incredibly stupid story line when North Korean invaders attack the United States of America with the help of the Russians and impose their ideology. A few young men seek refuge in the forests and try to fight the invaders by organizing a guerrilla. In the beginning, they are very unexperienced and a few of them won't survive their brave acts which leads to important tensions within the team but the guerrilla gets better and better and finally decides to attack the main building of the enemies.The positive thing about the movie is its short length and the fact that it never gets boring. The dialogues and the acting are a little bit weak but better than I would have expected. The action scenes are a little bit ordinary in the beginning but get better and better towards the explosive and entertaining end. I also liked the fact that the ending was rather surprising and dramatic. It's not your usual happy end and included two rather sad scenes even though the final message happens to be positive and warlike again.On the negative side, the story is completely stupid and unreal and the movie's intentions are not a far call from propaganda movies of the Cold War which feels rather inappropriate in modern times of globalization. The American screenwriters still seem to think that their government is the best in the world and that anybody who disagrees such as communists are automatically evil. This kind of movie only supports the propagandistic ideas of the North Korean government who takes the Americans for their worst enemies. While the North Korean government slowly opens for economy, diplomacy and modernization, Americans are still stuck in the past and release this kind of questionable movie. Some people might identify with the closed minded attitude to fight anything and anybody who attacks your country at all costs and that's what creates more and more conflicts but I simply can't agree on that point. As a German I can only say that I'm glad that my own country which I still love and respect a lot got defeated during the Second World War and I wouldn't have defended it if I had been able to chose. It's always a mistake to blindly follow a government and accept anything it asks you to do. American governments have created lots of wars, sometimes with good, sometimes with bad intentions, and it's strange that such a story line comes from this country because they haven't been the victims apart of 9/11 which was a terrible incident but definitely not a year long war as what happened in Korea or Vietnam. When arts and politics mix, the final result is always extremely biased and that's also the case of this movie. I'm surprised that these kinds of stories are still written today and one simply can't ignore this aspect if one watches this film. If there wasn't the political dimension of this movie and if the invaders would have been anonymous, I would have given one more point to the flick but this movie is still only of an average quality.In the end, I can only recommend this movie for those who are looking for a patriotic action flick. It's quite entertaining and gets better and better towards the end but the acting and the story are rather bad. Anything who expects a thought out story line or a strong acting shouldn't watch this movie. If you like war movies, you should go for the Korean ""Tae Guk Gi"" who shows you a very balanced and realistic view of what happened during the Korean War.",Red Dawn
37,TdSmth5,The story deserved better,6,19 June 2013,"The world is in crisis and suddenly North Korea invades and occupies the US, with the help of Russia for some reason. We follow some kids through all this as they hide in a cabin in the mountains. Among them is a returning marine Jed and his goofy looking younger brother Josh. We learn that Josh isn't one to follow advice but goes on his own to do stupid stuff, he doesn't care about the team but only about himself. Josh has a pretty girlfriend who like most of the population ends up in a a concentration camp.The escape by the kids catches the attention of main bad guy in charge of the area- Captain Cho. When Jed and Josh's dad basically commits suicide by government after giving an encouraging speech, the kids decide not to turn themselves in. In a fast forward scene we learn that suddenly the kids become freedom fighters, with the help of the population and they manage somehow to travel freely from city to county without any problem. And indeed they start committing acts of terrorism against the new government while gaining the support of the locals. They call themselves the wolverines and are now chased by Cho and his unit. At some point they meet up with two lone marines who are actually looking for them for help. They want to capture a communication device Cho uses and keeps in a suitcase and to get it they all will mount a complex operation to infiltrate Cho's headquarters.I'm not sure Red Dawn knows what it wants. It's not adolescent enough for teens and it's not mature enough for young adults. I sure would have liked to have seen more of the lovely Isabel Lucas and Adrianne Palicki. There are some very serious themes that could have been touched or focused on, but Red Dawn avoids that, too. Casting is equally unconvincing. Hemsworth is alright, Peck isn't. How does any professional casting person figure these two would make believable brothers? The girls are lovely but don't do much. There's a Cruise kid in there as well for some reason.Red Dawn is a timely movie no doubt. America still isn't done with the business of interfering in the affairs of other nations. And the parallels between one powerful nation invading another one in fiction and reality are fairly evident. We briefly see some propaganda posters the North Koreans have plastered all over the city and the rhetoric of the big shots all argue that invasion is for the good of the invaded. It's the same everywhere and at all times. The powerful know what's better for everyone and if the weak don't accept voluntarily they will have to at gunpoint. The movie also gives a good perspective of what ""terrorism"" is, once you look at it from the side of the occupied country. And I'm all for instilling some patriotism in kids, which isn't easy to do given all that is going on.Red Dawn could have been a strong movie had it been a bit more political. The quick-fast forward scene of how the kids become freedom fighting ""terrorists"" deserved much more attention. The ending also looks a bit unfinished, they were going more for visual effect than for story. Clearly the first-time director didn't know how to tell the story effectively enough. Of course one could argue whether a story liked this is suited to be put into the world of young teens. This is one movie that should have been at least 15 minutes longer.",Red Dawn
38,rgkarim,Give The Pretty Faces A Gun,6,22 November 2012,"Another holiday weekend means another round of movies to review. I'm Robbie K with another review on the latest movie remake entitled Red Dawn. For those of you who remember the 1984 war movie, you might wonder what was going on through Hollywood's heads when they decided to remake this ""classic"". For me I had no answer, other than more money by putting guns in hot teenager hands. However, I went in hoping that this movie would surprise me with something impressive that would make the price of admission worth it. Did I get my wish? Read on to find outJust like its predecessor, Red Dawn focuses on a small American town that is rapidly occupied by a foreign military power, this time North Korea. After parachuting in and establishing a military regime, a band of high school kids and one marine (Chris Hemsworth) ban together to fight the technology superb country in an effort to reclaim their city. As noble as the plot seems, the idea that a bunch of kids with no combat experience can put up a major resistance is a bit of a stretch to most. Nevertheless this film is a chronicle about how American Pride and cowboyism can be a deadly combination in fighting off bad guys. So what would I say are the strongest aspects about this movie? The answer is the action of course. With the evolution of technology, also comes the evolution of action scenes, which some choose to ignore. Red Dawn, however is one of those films that gladly takes advantage of pyrotechnics and CGI flashes to make guerilla warfare even flashier than before. Like a Michael Bay film, Red Dawn has plenty of fiery explosions to start off a battle. At the start, the action is very low key amounting to only a few chases and a small round of gun fire. As the movie progresses, the action picks up going from skirmishes to full on shoot outs that will get any action junkie nodding their heads in satisfaction. Unfortunately many of these battles last less than a minute, so don't think you're getting ten minute fights with every confrontation. Keep in mind though that this movie does have a really good battle near the end that lasts for a decent amount of time to quench your holiday thirst for action. You might be asking now, ""Robbie if these battles are short lived, what makes me want to keep watching the film?"" The answer is simple, the uncertainty as to which characters are going to live through this ordeal. Red Dawn's story team made it difficult to predict which character, if any, would get whacked, only having one or two obvious picks for who wouldn't live to see victory. This connection to the characters helps the audience member add their own suspense that makes the action scenes a little more emotional to the movie.Unfortunately these characters are very shallow in this movie, with very little development taking place outside of the two brothers. Yes, my friends the cast for this movie was chosen more for their looks than for actual character development, most likely to bring in more audience members. Cast members like Josh Peck, Josh Hutcherson, and Chris Hemsworth are playing the ""macho"" men, more being used for eye candy/ fame to drive people into the theater. To help get males further interested in the film, they put beautiful women like Adrianne Palicki, Isabel Lucas, and Alyssa Diaz in to help appease the good look category for the males. I'm not saying their bad actors at all, but the directors got away with the shallow characters, by putting these big name faces in. Now this wouldn't have been as bad, had they not sacrificed action for their rather useless background history. Many of the lulls in action are quips where we learn one or two tales about what the teens did when they were younger, which is really kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things. The only meaningful information comes from between the brothers, Peck and Hemsworth characters, who reveal the tension and rivalry you see in the movie. Regardless, fans are going to be rooting the characters not based on their morals, but by their looks and previous movie history.Aside from these two things, Red Dawn really doesn't offer too much more in the movie department. The fact that a technologically strong country like North Korea doesn't have better armor for their troops is complete fiction and makes the threat of the enemy a little less intimidating. Throw in the fact that the kids can shoot better than the troops, and well you get a classic American cowboy film that further pumps up someone's ego. Aside from American pride, this movie also has a vague ending just like its 80's precursor that sets the stage for both ending and opens up for another movie. Whether or not this sways your vote I can't tell, but I'm just warning you that there is no definite closure to this film. Overall Red Dawn is a glorified video game brought back to the theaters. The action again is decent for most of the movie, though could have been longer for my tastes. However, again its mostly people coming in to see model like teenagers toting guns and rooting for their favorite new generation star to survive the day. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Probably not, but is worth picking up a copy at Netflix/RedBox when it comes out. My scores for this movie are the following: Action: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5 Until then my friends I'm signing out. This is Robbie K saying enjoy the movies and please continue to provide constructive feedback by contacting rkarim11@su.edu. Thanks",Red Dawn
39,moviexclusive,"Bad doesn't begin to describe how terrible this action movie is – illogical, nonsensical and just plain dumb, this Dawn deserves never to see the light of day",2,19 November 2012,"There are big, loud and dumb movies, and then there are movies like 'Red Dawn', which deserve to belong to a category in themselves for being sheer stupidity magnified. The fact that this was in fact a remake of a 1984 movie that starred the likes of Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen and Jennifer Grey is no excuse for how blatantly silly the premise is – if you're looking to give it another go, the least you can do is to try to make it better.For those who have not heard of that John Milius picture, its essential conceit was how a ragtag group of teens become a formidable resistance force when their peaceful community is suddenly attacked by an occupying force. The Russians were the ones unfortunate enough to be vilified then – not surprising given the lingering Cold War fears – but writers Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore have made the North Koreans the invaders this time round, though any real world relevance the opening sequence of edited news footage might suggest the movie would have is quickly thrown out of the window barely ten minutes into the film.After briefly introducing the audience to the pair of brothers – the newly returned Iraq War veteran Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) and his hot-headed younger brother Matt (Josh Peck) – the North Koreans are literally dropped into the movie. Waking up the rumble of explosions, Jed and Matt are horrified to discover that the sky is dotted with North Korean bombers and scores of soldiers are parachuting into the town in a hostile takeover attempt. If it already sounds unconvincing as we are describing it to you, trust us when we tell you it looks even more ridiculous on screen.Are we supposed to believe that within the span of one night, the North Koreans have suddenly made their way halfway across the globe to attack America? Are we supposed to believe that they could have come with all that firepower? And worst of all, are we supposed to even buy into the fact that they would even bother about a small town called Spokane? Sure, we would willingly suspend our disbelief for a movie that bothers to make sense; but 'Red Dawn' makes no such attempt, and utterly baffles in how it thinks it can get away with such an absurd setup.Does it get better along the way? Absolutely not. Seeing his father executed before their eyes, Jed comes to the conclusion that they need to prepare for war – and just like that, he becomes training commander of a young team of rebels who call themselves the 'Wolverines'. They learn to fight, to shoot and to hide, all in the name of preparing to wage an urban guerrilla campaign against the North Koreans who have taken over their town with their arsenal of soldiers, jeeps, and tanks.And when they are finally ready, Matt decides to undermine their plans by scuttling off to rescue his girlfriend Erica (Isabel Lucas), thereby igniting a brotherly conflict between the rational and responsible Jed and the impulsive and impetuous Matt. What a pathetic attempt at trying to make us care about two stock types who frankly are just in the movie so we have the good guys – the same goes for bringing Toni (Adrianne Paliki) and Erica into the fray and building some sort of romantic links between Jed and Matt respectively.Even if we accept the tradeoffs in plot and character most B-movies would have their audience make, the least director Dan Bradley could have done is to mount some decently shot action sequences. That is precisely Bradley should have done with his cameraman Mitchell Amundsen – shoot him point blank. Clearly trying too hard to emulate the 'Bourne' films to lend the action a sense of urgency, the shaky camera-work is downright frustrating to watch, and even more so because the sequences – especially the final one set within a huge circular room fronted on all sides with glass windows – are pretty promising to begin with.No thanks to its abundant flaws, the movie also wastes its promising young cast. Hemsworth has good presence as the smart leader of the team (he takes over Patrick Swayze's role in the original), while Josh Hutcherson (who played Peeta in 'The Hunger Games' and here is in C. Thomas Howell's role) brings naivety and temperance to the role of Robert Kitner, a bookish type who turns warrior because of circumstance. Less convincing is Peck, who mostly just looks too stoned to convey any sort of inner dilemma his character is supposed to face.Nonetheless, the acting is the least of the flaws in a movie that is painfully illogical and utterly nonsensical. Its invasion scenario might have been able to fly with an audience in the '80s, but to try to transplant the same premise to today's context is just plain daftness. Ironically, there are some moments that appear to suggest that the filmmakers are wise enough to know not to take the movie too seriously – but those moments fade away as soon as the next unabashed war-mongering scene arrives.Don't get us wrong – this isn't about whether we love B-action movies or not. We do, but it is movies that insult the intelligence of its audience that we truly detest, and 'Red Dawn' is one perfect example of that. Watch only if you need to understand the meaning of stupid.",Red Dawn
40,Screen_Blitz,Remake of the 80s original is a major letdown,3,30 November 2015,"Directed by Dan Bradley, Red Dawn is a remake of a 1980s war flick about a group of Colorado teenagers who hide up into the woods and form a guerrilla army to defend their town when it gets invaded by the Cuban and Soviet army. This time around, the main villains are the North Koreans. Set in Spokane, Washington, Chris Hemsworth plays Jeb, a U.S marine who returns home from active duty to watch his high school brother Matt (played by Josh Peck) play football. Matt is a nice guy who is dating a smoking hot cheerleader named Erica (played by Isabel Lucas). After facing a disappointing loss, Jeb and Matt meet up at a local restaurant with some old friends including Jeb's crush Toni (played by Adrianne Palicki), Robert (played by Josh Hutcherson), Daryl (played by Connor Cruise), and Danny (played by Edwin Hodge). Next morning, Jeb and Matt wake up to find their neighborhood being occupied by North Korean soldiers with thousand of paratroopers descending from the sky. Surrounded by neighbors being abducted by Korean troopers, the two brothers hop into their truck, along with their friends, and escape into a cabin deep into the woods where they meet a few other survivors including Greg (played by Julian Alcaratz), Julie (played by Alyssa Diaz), and eventually Lieutenant Colonol Andrew Tanner (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Upon discovering their own to be overrun the North Korean army, the team form their own army and begin waging guerrilla warfare against the North Koreans in attempt to save their town from invasion.I really enjoyed the 1984 original with Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Brad Savage, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. It was fun to watch and express a clever, if unrealistic, idea. This movie tries to reprint the same idea of the original film, but fails execute effectively. With its appealing cast of teen stars, this movie expresses an interesting idea, but butchers it with poor writing, lack of character development, and combat action scenes that are sadly not too exciting to watch. When the North Korean army first appears, viewers get filled with excitement and suspense to the point where the characters make their escape from all the mayhem. From there on out after this scene, the movie immediately stops becoming interesting. Nearly every character feels one-dimensional, and none of them are even memorable. Chris Hemsworth's character Jeb who is the main character isn't even very likable. In the original movie, Jeb, played by Patrick Swayze, was a tough, but loving older brother who just wanted to look after his little brother and his friends. Here, he's kind of a jerk, especially towards his brother. Then there are the active combat scenes which are rather boring and lack any sort of emotional investment. With the exceptions a few explosions, most of these scenes are not very exciting. Lastly, the film ending is way too abrupt as it ends in a way that will make viewers say ""What?, that's it?"". This is very disappointing, especially when the film only runs of 93 minutes, unlike the original film which lasted for almost two hours.Whether this film is a remake or something original, it is still quite a letdown. This movie had so much potential with its compelling idea and stellar cast, and it only manages to waste it on a poorly written script. This is quite disappointing, especially due since this film spent three years trying to be released.",Red Dawn
41,Troy_Campbell,Not worth parting with your hard earned dollars.,5,29 November 2012,"Clunky, messy and technically subpar, this remake of the 80's movie starring Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen should've been easy to dismiss as a complete bomb. In truth, the first act is monumentally bad; the background of characters is clumsily explored, the interaction between them is unbelievably awkward and the introduction of the invasion plot (those pesky North Koreans raid United States) is nonsensical. Then, just before I started to scratch my eyes out to stop the pain, the film gets into explosion/gunfire mode and severely lifts its game. It's not mind-blowing action by any standard – and the rapidity of how the ragtag bunch of kids become a proficient guerrilla unit spits in the face of credibility – yet it has a rough-around-the-edges quality that raises the tension and by the time the exciting finale arrives I found I was actually enjoying myself. A glaring misstep on Chris Hemsworth's resume and definitely not worth parting with your hard earned to see at the multiplex, but consider renting on DVD if there's nothing else on offer.",Red Dawn
42,MiketheWhistle,not a bad remake if you ignore who's the invader,7,20 June 2020,"There are a lot of negative comments about North Korea being made as the villain and they are certainly correct that it is ridiculous that NK could ever infade the US. Obviously someone(s) who completely ignored the power of China and had them as the invaders first and obviously left them with very limited choices as to who could be subbed in.Enough about that. I typically dislike remakes and while I don't think this remake is better than the original, it's not terrible at all. It's actually pretty good. Chris H delivers along with several other actors and the interactions of them are believable and work.Technically there are several errors which I guess goes back to the unthinking original choice to make China the bad guys. All said, I wouldn't go out of the way to watch it, but I'd definitely make time to watch it.",Red Dawn

Once achieved they do what all oppressive, maniacal regimes do: set up loads of check-points and put posters up all over the place.Cue the squeaky clean American teenage resistant fighters.Now there is room in the world for simpler movies and I like to switch off and watch a bit of action. But the characters insist on making comparisons with themselves and the insurgents in Iraq, but it is a false analogy. The Korean solders don't go home to their families get a prosthetic limb fitted and try to deal with their PTSD, they die face down in the dirt - in their droves.And that moves us to the main flaw with this movie. The Korean's are useless, they run after the Wolverines like old English bobbies yelling 'stop!' before being shot in the face. For ninety minutes they go down like so many bowling pins. Short of summoning Godzilla(even then I wouldn't like their chances) every encounter is a bloody, one-sided, yawn-inducing, full gone conclusion.

44,eminkl,Just compare the original Red Dawn with its remake.,3,29 September 2019,"The new Red Dawn remake is a fine example of a number of dispiriting trends in the filmmaking industry. The picture was based on a brand name instead of a heartfelt original tale. The studios mutilated it in order to placate Chinese Communists. And it was served up to audiences that studios assume will eat whatever they are served. Ever-increasing budgets and declining domestic audiences have forced studios to look for box office success abroad. ""Aimed at Bangkok and Bangalore as much as at Bangor,"" David Denby recently wrote in the New Republic, ""our big movies have been defoliated of character, wit, psychology, local color.""

47,ersinkdotcom,"""Red Dawn"" 2012 a successful update",8,24 November 2012,"Remaking beloved classic films is a dangerous job for directors and studios. Many times they find themselves treading on what is considered hallowed ground. The latest trend in revisiting old material is to take a concept from an old movie and loosely use it as the framework for something new yet familiar. A good example of this approach working is ""Fright Night."" We can now add ""Red Dawn"" to the list of successful updates.Everyone knows the basic premise of ""Red Dawn."" The United States is invaded by a foreign country and certain regions are annexed. Some citizens go on living their lives in oppression while others are sent to re-education camps. A group of high schoolers escape and wage war on the military forces occupying their territory. They must find a way to free the enslaved people and retake their hometown.Who is the enemy in the remake of ""Red Dawn?"" That's the main question being asked by people. The Soviet Union teamed up with Cuba and Nicaragua in the original movie. The revamp has North Korea invading the U.S. with some weapon support from Russia.I know what everyone is thinking. ""How realistic is it that any foreign country could attack and take over part of the United States?"" It's highly unlikely, but with our military so ingrained in the use of electronics for their weaponry and vehicles, it could potentially happen. The way the countries in ""Red Dawn"" hit us is by using electromagnetic pulses to black out our computers and communication centers, thus leaving us blind and unable to use any sort of electronic equipment.Upon revisiting the original film, the first thing I noticed was the contrast in the amount of graphic violence between the two versions. The 1984 movie was more intense and heavy than the 2012 adaptation. It's obvious the 2012 ""Red Dawn"" is made for a contemporary teen audience. Whether it was director Dan Bradley's intent to make the film for that demographic when he shot it in 2009 doesn't really matter. With the recent success of ""The Hunger Games"" and other young adult movies, Distributors FilmDistrict and Open Road Films fashioned it to appeal to that audience.Much like the original 1984 movie, the new ""Red Dawn"" features a cast of popular young actors of the day. Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") takes over as Jed Eckert in the role Patrick Swayze had. Josh Peck (""Drake and Josh,"" ""The Wackness"") inherits Charlie Sheen's part as Matt Eckert. Josh Hutcherson (""The Hunger Games"") is a tamer version of Robert, who C. Thomas Howell played in the first version. Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey, the girls of the group, are replaced by Isabel Lucas (""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"") and Adrianne Palicki (""Supernatural"").What we get with this remake of ""Red Dawn"" is a tamer film that still addresses all the issues the first one did. However, it's done in a softer, gentler way. The important thing is that it will hopefully make teenagers and even adults reflect on how reliant we've become on technology. Most importantly, it should leave the audience realizing how completely unprepared we are to ""live off the land"" if any sort of disaster ever occurred that took away all our modern conveniences.",Red Dawn
48,Christian_Dimartino,I now know the real reason why this has been on the shelves for so long.,4,15 December 2012,"Youtube is a wonderful web site that is pretty useful for those, like me, who are always bored. As a movie-goer, I try to watch whatever movies I can. Even the bad ones, though I refuse to spend eight bucks on a crap movie. So, Youtube is sort of a life-saver in the sense that I just watched the new Red Dawn on there, and I saved myself eight bucks, and quite the painful experience of sitting in a chair for what might be the slowest 90 minutes of the year.This is a remake of an 80's movie that not many even know exists. The film revolves around a group of teens played by Chris Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, and,wait for it, Josh Peck of all people, who fight for their country and all of that cheesy mumbo-jumbo that they constantly throw at us.The film was actually made quite some time ago, but it took this long to release it. Apparently is was because of the disputes at Metro-Golden Myer, but I will tell you otherwise. They kept this from us for so long because it is a piece of crap. I felt as if the film overstayed its welcome within six minutes. The only suspense I felt was waiting for the credits to roll.The acting is pretty much split in two ways: The actors either spit out ludicrous and Velveeta-stuffed dialogue large enough to fit a Big Mac or they are just plain bland. I also discovered why we haven't seen Josh Peck in such a while, and it's because nobody can take him seriously. In my eyes, he is the top Razzie contender for worst supporting actor. I was bored senseless in this movie, mainly because I could predict its every move. Red Dawn offers us nothing exactly new, and nothing really exciting. In fact, I was so bored that I nearly scratched my scalp off. Though I can't say this is nearly as painful as lets say Ghost Rider 2 or John Carter, this is truly Razzie material, served on a cold dish with a bunch of Cheddar. Skip it.C-",Red Dawn
49,Aylmer,What an amazing failure on every level,2,18 February 2014,"While the original was no great shakes due to over-length and extreme lapses in realism, it had its share of amazing 80's action and some good production values and ideas here and there. It was the first movie I'd seen to tackle the prospect of a ground war on American soil and an ensuing insurgency against foreign occupiers. The fact that it came at the height of the Cold War gave it a sort of historical relevance as well. It had a great supporting cast and an okay central one of up-and- comers who went on to a lot of bigger things. It also had the benefit of no-nonsense direction from John Milius and a fitting score by Basil Poledouris.This remake has none of that. No excitement, poor casting, zero characterization, bland music, shaky camera work, and of course CGI overload. It's everything bad in modern action movies focused and amplified into one mindless excuse to show a bunch of pretty people stand around whining and brandishing weapons. None of the action scenes have any life, originality, and a lot of the last portion of the film is so vague, tiresome, and too dark to even make out what is going on and to whom and why it is even important.Most unforgivably, the film was altered in post-production by cowardly MGM executives, changing the Chinese invaders into North Korean ones in order to not insult the Chinese market, though if the the Chinese censors were smart they'd still ban this disaster anyway for fear of damaging the minds of their population. This alteration takes an already implausible film into the realm of the preposterous and laughable. It may have been fascinating if there was any analysis on the North Korean military, culture, occupation etc. but the circumstances of this last minute change make that impossible. It's so underwritten that it misses major chances to add any interest into the concept, focusing instead on a bunch of macho posturing, teen angst, and infighting. I had the feeling that the writers were even younger and less experienced than the teenagers the film was aimed at, especially considering the film features a working Subway restaurant functioning in North Korean-occupied America! Even behind the battle lines in an apocalyptic war-zone, the franchise food and soft drink distribution remains completely undisturbed? Or are the employees growing and harvesting the grain for the 7-grain wheat bread on the roof of the building?Don't waste your time, even for a laugh. This film is so bad it will just make your head hurt. I'm consistently amazed by how much money can be spent on objects of so little value. Some heads at MGM surely rolled because of this, but of course nobody learned any lessons outside of outsourcing more work on the next terrible movie in order to cut costs.",Red Dawn

Enter Josh Peck's passive Matt, who has a girlfriend he loves more than anything while Hemsworth, as the muscular Jed, only knows how to fight and survive But now we're skipping ahead – befitting a movie that cuts quickly to the chase: During the opening credits we get a splash of news reports predicting very bad things caused by the economy, terrorists and other current events The writers obviously wanted the war raging fast so target audiences (teens and nostalgic adults) won't get antsy.The best scene in the 1984 original, catapulting the reality of invasion to the oblivious students, has a school teacher walking out to face a group of mysterious skydivers landing outside a classroom... Here a bunch of warplanes (one crashing into a house) blow the town to smithereens, which is as suspenseful as watching a friend play a video game.While the frantic camera continuously shakes and shudders, the Wolverines go in and out of hiding and are never sure what they're hiding from or fighting against The North Koreans are the attackers with a few Russians present. And there are no decent villains except one Korean soldier with a permanent glare.Eventually, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and two other Marines join the cause. Unlike Powers Booth's maverick pilot in the original, teaching the kids a thing or two about real warfare, there's no reason for the adults to be around – especially since Jed's a veteran already – other than to marvel at the capability of the youngsters and providing more people with guns.There are a few ""missions,"" the most important taking place in a multilevel building i.e. the enemy's makeshift Base of Operations, with lots of running around providing little suspense. Although there's an unpredictable ""twist"" that does successfully shake things up But after this happens you'll wonder: Why continue the story at all? The worst aspect of this pointless sequel aren't lines like ""Marines don't die – they go to hell and regroup"" but the undeveloped characters that seem to have just met even though they've grown up in the same town all their lives. With an exception of the two leads, none of the kids really stand out: what's needed is a C. Thomas Howell type slowly becoming a Gung Ho psychopath, or women with more purpose than being eye-candy love interests.Sure, the patriotic original can be corny and downright preposterous, but the kids have a deep connection with each other, before and after the takeover, making even the silly stuff count.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Red Dawn

53,daniel-mannouch,Directed by a stuntman. Action set pieces were good. The rest...,4,24 July 2019,"A young-ish Chris Hemsworth and that guy from Drake and Josh star in the questionably PG-13 rated 2012 remake of Red Dawn, to date the sole directorial credit of career stuntman Dan Bradley.You know Homefront? That's kinda the story here. For the benefit of those who didn't live that experience, Red Dawn 2012 consists of a Kim Jung Un led North Korea and an extremist led Russia invading the United States and those other countries. A group of teens evade capture and form a resistance group known as the Wolverines. Their mission is to liberate their country from these foreign invaders using insurgency methods.Red Dawn '12 is a highly implausible and not that well acted action film that has it's entertainment value salvaged only by it's well crafted action set pieces. There is nothing engaging to be found in the story apart from comedic value, but there are several action scenes which feature practical stunts, a lot of meaty sound effects and a not too obnoxious amount of high shutter speed shaky cam, although your personal mileage might vary on the latter.If it was not for these enjoyable action sequences, Red Dawn, isn't that Jeffery Epstien over there?, might have turned out to be an even more laughably, even infamously bad effort. But a ridiculous non ending aside, the wildly entertaining acts of terrorism within the film are enough to make this little war fantasy enjoyable enough background noise.",Red Dawn

I didn't expect much so I was surprised.Chris Hemsworth (aka Thor) was the lead, and he put in a good effort as an US Marine on leave back home. His brother (Josh Peck) was pretty decent too. Their father is the local sheriff and their local school mascot is the Wolverines. they live in Washington State.Suddenly, the US is invaded and they are under attack from the North Koreans. You'll see a lot of guns and bullets and bombs, but not much of a plot. Still, there were enough tiny twists in the plot, and poignant (sad) moments to get you to root for the good guys against the bad guys.It's worth a rental from your library. I don't know how this compares to the original from 1984, but I guess it will be similar. Enjoy.",Red Dawn

59,nesfilmreviews,Bad remade just as bad.,2,23 March 2013,"I had to write a review for ""Red Dawn"" because not only do you chose to remake a terrible original movie ""Red Dawn"" (1984), starring Patrick Swayze, the remake is just as awful. We all understand remakes are a given--but's it's horrible to begin with, currently irrelevant--and just as bad. It's so bad it's almost good because it's so hilariously bad. A city in Washington state awakens to the surreal sight of foreign paratroopers dropping from the sky - shockingly, the U.S. has been invaded and their hometown is the initial target. Quickly and without warning, the citizens find themselves prisoners and their town under enemy occupation. Determined to fight back, a group of young patriots seek refuge in the surrounding woods, training, and reorganizing themselves into a guerrilla group of fighters. Taking inspiration from their high school mascot, they call themselves the Wolverines, banding together to protect one another, liberate their town from its captors, and take back their freedom. The nature of the invasion quickly becomes clear. The velocity of events picks up considerably, however, in an endless and mindless combat sequence--in which the Wolverines prove to be fierce combat troops, and the North Koreans are reassuringly incompetent. The kids--even the girlfriends, are highly adept at handling heavy-duty automatic weapons. The home-team Wolverines are headed by star player Matt Eckert (Josh Peck), whose older brother, Jed (Chris Hemsworth), is a Marine just returning from active duty. Jed takes unofficial command as the Wolverines go into action against the invaders. Matt's girlfriend is Erica (Isabel Lucas), a cheerleader, and Toni (Adrianne Palicki), is a spunky hometown girl who develops a crush on Jed. In 1984, ""Red Dawn"" was as at the very least relevant with our cold war with Russia. Yes, it was a bad film, but kids could at least get behind the paper thin storyline. This is 2013- and ""Red Dawn"" is inconsequential, forgettable, and destined to irrelevance once released on March 3rd. You remake a terrible movie and make it just as terrible. Mission accomplished.",Red Dawn
60,twanster-97655,Entertaining but...,4,9 December 2020,"The original red dawn was set up to play on American patriotism against the Russians.. This version is the same but this time, its set up to rally patriotism against N-Korea.. As an action film its pretty good, the down side is its all just to pretty... Its more like a video game in that it's unrealistic and pretty goofy but is a feel good movie if your an American.. As long as you don't take it seriously, you'll enjoy a teen action film.. If your looking for realism then you'll be disappointed.",Red Dawn
61,Ric-7,Missed opportunity,4,22 November 2013,"This film might have been vastly improved (i.e., at least made endurable) had the ""Wolverines"" been a scout troop and Hemsworth would be their leader. The action would not have been any more believable, of course, but at least the producers might claim that it was supposed to be funny. As it is, there are some funny moments, but not nearly enough to save the film or to recommend it as a comedy.The ""plot"" was certainly not new (and it wasn't new in the earlier version, either). The multiple car crashes in the first ten minutes kind of set the tone for what was to follow. I think the film would have gone straight to cable had they not paid multi-millions to Hemsworth.",Red Dawn
62,GirishGowda,"Derivative, boring and a wasted opportunity.",4,25 September 2013,"An introductory montage shows the fallout of the economic crisis in the European Union and a weakened NATO alliance, amid increasing cooperation between an increasingly militant North Korea and ultranationalist-controlled Russia. The increased deployment of U.S. troops abroad (and the highlighted threat of cyber warfare) leaves the mainland vulnerable. U.S. Marine Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) is home on leave in Spokane, Washington. He reunites with his father, Spokane Police Sergeant Tom Eckert (Cullen) and his brother, football player Matt Eckert (Josh Peck). The morning after a mysterious power outage, Jed and Matt are shocked to see swarms of invading North Korean paratroopers and transport aircraft. A misfit band of teenagers look to save their town from the invasion of North Korean soldiers.In the original movie, the Koreans invaded America and it was believable back in the day due to the raging cold war and political climate of the era. Its campy execution was a positive. But, in this age, the Koreans wouldn't attack them if you think from a rational angle. One major annoyance was that you could see that it wasn't originally Koreans who attacked the US in the movie, but the Chinese and all the bad cover ups were quite distracting. Something like this, even if it were possible, the movie went in its execution in such a way that it was barely watchable with its laughably convoluted storyline. Josh Peck seemed like he was gunning to win the title of 'the most awful actor in history' and I cannot believe that I liked him once upon a time in the TV show, Josh and Drake. All my respect for him is obviously gone now. Josh Hutcherson is wasted and gives a bland performance. Isabel Lucas was hot and nothing more. But Adrianne Palicki and Chris Hemsworth were good and did their best to salvage Red Dawn. The movie didn't feel totally worthless, but it was definitely awful and didn't have anything to say. Derivative, boring and a wasted opportunity.4/10",Red Dawn
63,RichardSRussell-1,They Canceled Dark Angel but Remade THIS?,3,29 November 2012,"Nobody expected much from Red Dawn, the remake of the howlingly bad 1984 anti-Commie propaganda film from the paranoid pen of John Milius that posited a Nicaraguan invasion of Colorado. Congratulations. Not much is exactly what you get, only for variety this time it's a North Korean invasion of Washington (the state, not the city). You do get Chris Hemsworth — who's done good work as Thor and in Cabin in the Woods — as Patrick Swayze, er, Jed Eckert, US Marine on leave from overseas combat, but he isn't given anything to do except ooze testosterone and carefully maintain the 5 days' growth of beard that he started the film with and continues to sport thruout the entire movie. The extremely thin SF premise is that an EMP has knocked out the electricity in the US (shades of Dark Angel, a much superior drama) just before the paratroopers start raining out of a fleet of transport aircraft that cover the sky like passenger pigeons. But the Koreans themselves have hardened communications, so they scoff at the lack of power. If our heroes can only liberate some of that tech, they may be able to mount as effective a resistance as those guys in the black pajamas did during that little contretemps in the '70s. Whether they succeed in doing so or not is left as a thot experiment for the serious student. Nah, just kidding. Of course they pull it off, and the gals look damn ravishing while doing it, too.Tho set in Spokane, the film was shot in Michigan, and the resistance fighters adopt the nickname of their high-school football team, the Wolverines.

64,daggersineyes,Not very good,3,3 July 2016,"I remember seeing the original version of this from the 80's and that was OK, nothing fantastic but an original idea and worth a watch for the action and acting. THis recent remake isn't even OK - it's woeful. The acting is dreadful, the story is thin, the action scenes hard to follow because they are mostly in dark or filmed so close you can't see what's going on (ie they are cheating). I give it 3 for a few good moments in an otherwise dire production, I mean I have seen worse, but not by much. The patriotism and ""inspiring"" speeches just don't ring true - it all comes across as lame & desperate and a lot of the ""acting"" is not much more than blank stares conveying nothing at all. Isabel Lucas should be banned from anything resembling a screen, she is an embarrassment to Australian Film & Television and the rest of the cast were only marginally better.

65,LOL101LOL,Lipstick Red Dawn,1,22 February 2013,"I have seen the original version many a times, and is a classic film, not because it is getting old(er) but it had a great cast, was well acted and directed. Sure the whole invasion from North Korea is some what open for discussion when it comes to realism, but thats cool as it makes for great action viewing, dis-regardless who the enemy wold have been.But this money grabbing Hollywood version is just a plain insult to the memory of Patrick Swayze! Like other reviews on here, Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas, and think by having lots of special effects and car explosions it makes for good viewing, well they are wrong again.I really got emotional while watching this, I felt like crying for wasting my money and time on this.1 out of 10!",Red Dawn
66,azanti0029,"A troubled production, and it showed.......",3,19 March 2013,"This remake of the 1980's cold war paranoia era feature film that starred Patrick Swayze, among others, isn't a patch on its predecessor. The original film, while not a classic, was an enjoyable movie about a fictional Russian invasion of the USA in a barely plausible non-nuclear war scenario.Here we follow in a similar set up, its the Chinease (Opps we changed our mind in post) I mean a pan-Korean led coalition or something. America is invaded from the skies while all its electronic defences are knocked out. In the films most spectacular scene as paratroops fall from the sky a group of local college youths assisted by an older (marine) brother soon flee to the mountains and start a guerrilla war. However what could have been a fun film is soon spoil-ed by some obvious plot holes and glaring scene omissions that are obviously as a result of the fact that the production shut down before all the filming was completed. Some characters seem to just disappear and scenes which should obviously been included are not. The ending just seemed like it was cobbled together in an edit room at the last minute so the film could be released. This time the group has to steal the device responsible for making the bad guys immune to the black out in the first place. People have made comparisons to 'Tomorrow, When the War Began' but you have to remember that this movie actually shot first, and also the original Red Dawn came out in 1982/83 so such claims are unfounded. Tomorrow is actually a much better film than this as the characters are more solidly defined. Here, there isn't much of an arc for anyone and while there are a couple of good action sequences, the film doesn't have the feel of scale as its predecessor. There's no chases with Hind gunships in this movie. The actors acquit themselves well, considering the trite dialogue they have been handed, but I was expecting a much better film than what is served up here. Special mention should go to Connor Cruise (I didn't realise he's Tom's son, and stop calling him, his adopted son people, he's just his son, adopted or not!) He puts in a good performance as the conflicted Daryl whose father has gone over to work for the other side. I suspect there was much more to be filmed that never went before the lens when the production shut down, and that's a shame. Whatthere is, the opening invasion sequence not withstanding, is, alas,instantly forgettable.",Red Dawn
67,chow913,"Bad, Could Have Been Worse",5,25 May 2013,"I'm not going to critique the acting, photography, or editing too much. They're bad/average for Hollywood.No I'm going to focus more on the huge failures in basic logic and basic film making the new 'Red Dawn' makes.Of course this is a remake of the 80s Reagan era classic about an American everytown invaded by communist troops. The only escapees of the high school massacre opening scene become survivalists in the deep woods and become insurgent freedom fighters calling themselves ""The Wolverines."" In this sense 'Red Dawn' is true to the original plot.The first major flaw is high school students (all in their early thirties) awaking to poorly animated CGI airplanes dropping CGI paratroopers. These are some of the worst FX in recent memory. How difficult and basic is it to simply dress some stuntmen in military fatigues and film them parachuting? The did it in the first film just fine! The second, which many fans were already groaning over was that red China threatened a boycott not only of this but all of the studios films from ever being released in there, if the Chinese were portrayed as the communist invaders. Hence we're stuck with North Korea as the villains.In an opening montage a sarcastic reporter asks, ""What are they building a army this large for?"" The logical guess would be that North Korea is still officially at war with South Korea, but 'Red Dawn' would have us believe they're secretly planning to invade the American West Coast? There is also some dispute as to how much of the film was made prior to villains' nationality change. Some rumors state the actors were actually filmed speaking Mandarin and had to be dubbed speaking Korean. It's unclear from the released footage.Third, much like 'V For Vendetta' Hollywood also seems to have forgotten why communism is evil. In one ridiculous scene the Wolverines rob a Subway restaurant for its fresh bread and meat. See this is why communism doesn't work, the people are too poor to have things like fresh food. HOW THE FXXX would a communist Subway have fresh food? This is why it took decades for McDonald's to open its Moscow location. Because communists don't understand basic principles like farms delivering food to restraints. This isn't so much an insult to the intelligence of the audience as it is to the film makers.There are various other plot holes, such as the blonde love interest (Isabel Lucas) being held as a political prisoner. ""She's a survivor. I'm sure she's fine,"" the Wolverines reassure each other. Yes, certainly the invading troops wouldn't be using a gorgeous blonde teenager for gang rape or anything. As you may recall in the original Jennifer Grey and Lea Thompson were both gang rape victims.Another flaw is the Wolverines driving into the woods and looking for a radio. Certainly one of the three cars they drove in would have had a radio.All in all the new 'Red Dawn' isn't that bad. It just strips most of the emotional scenes we loved from the original and turns a bold premise into a 90 minute shoot'm up flick.",Red Dawn
68,mbs,Not unbelievably bad but pretty mediocre and very very choppily edited,4,22 November 2012,"Lets get this out of the way--the new Red Dawn is watchable, but barely. The cast is OK, but barely. The action scenes would be barely watchable if they weren't so badly edited to the point that you can not tell what is happening from cut to cut in each fight/action sequence that occurs. You get the general idea of what's happening--but there are so many times during each of the lets say four or five major action sequences where it looks like chaos is reigning. I don't know if this is a fault of the director not being good at staging these scenes--or not being good at the placement of the camera during these scenes--or if its the complete fault of the editor---i do not want to blame the editor because i read that the original first cut of this remake was nearly 4 hours along and had to drastically be cut down to fit the hour and a half running time that is this movie's current length. I am 100 percent positive that this could not have been easy on the editors who worked on this thing to whip it into a kind of shape so that the film could be released in theaters. I wish I could say that the sloppily choppily done action sequences were the only flaw in an otherwise watchable mediocre remake--but it really a huge flaw especially when these sequences more or less make up half the movie right there! its almost like a film from Dimension studios from the mid to late 90's in its editing--you remember Phantoms? It was watchable but it was hard to tell exactly what was happening in the big scenes--its a lot like that. On a positive note tho I would like to point out that Chris Hemsworth makes a fine leading man in the film--he very much is the anchor that keeps this film from being completely and totally weightless--I'm not saying that he's a great actor but he does a fine enough job as the man whose chief job it is to whip everyone into shape--you believe him as his character and you believe he could form a good resistance group--unfortunately everyone else in the movie is either way too underused (Josh Hutchinson may as well be a background character for all the lines he actually has in this thing---he's supposed to be one of the lead resistance fighters but the film must have left a good number of his scenes on the editing floor because he really only a handful of scenes here) or just plain old bad--which brings me to Josh Peck as the second lead--Chris Hemsworth younger brother who's supposed to be the character who picks up the spark of resistance and runs with it. Josh Peck is really really wooden here---his character is supposed to have these really strong emotions--his entire world has been more or less been taken away from him!--but his um big heartfelt emotional scenes in which he expresses this are very much lacking in any kind of feeling. He smiles effectively tho--when he's taking a compliment or kidding around with his girlfriend at the beginning of the movie he's very convincing--unfortunately that's pretty much the last time in the movie he's convincing and by the end of the movie its kind of hard to believe that he's been truly changed by all the craziness that's happened. Still if the film had been better staged--I don't think I would have been so hard on him, because when the film isn't full of choppy action sequences its filled with scenes of Hemsworth sermonizing to his freedom fighters or scenes of Peck brooding, its not terrible but if the action scenes in Red Dawn aren't delivering, all the emoting in the world isn't gonna save the film. Still the film remains watchable in that you can watch it, think about what really would happen if some country in the east invaded us and how we would react, and pretty much forget it by the time you get home from the theater. ALSO WOLVERINES!!!!",Red Dawn
69,David_Brown,Solid Remake,7,25 August 2013,"Lets start with the bad news: The ""Red Dawn"" remake is inferior to the original and ""Olympus Has Fallen"" ( another film which dealt with evil North Koreans). But it is better than I expected. It is about teenagers who band together to fight for their homes in the Spokane Area, after they are invaded by North Korea who is able to control the power supply. The best on in the film is Chris Hemsworth ( Jed Eckert), which is the Patrick Swayze role in the original, and Josh Peck as his brother Matt ( who although is not Charlie Sheen), is not a disaster ( he reminds me of early Keanu Reeves when he played 'Ted' in ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure.""), and actually gets better throughout the film. My favorite scene ( spoilers ahead) is where Matt ( the surviving brother ( both die in the original)), rally the kids to fight because this is your home (this happens at the football field where he played ball), and they go out and kick major a** as the film ends. Very different than Erica (Lea Thompson) at ""Freedom Rock"" at the end of the original. There are people who think this is a happier ending than the original. The original showed victory over the Russians and here, Erica ( Isabel Lewis), and the rest must fight with no guarantee of victory. I give it 7 of 10 stars mostly because Peck and Lewis are not Sheen and Thompson. But I will say the action here was a lot better, and the enemy was even more evil Captain Cho was a worse than Badinov of the original. Still better than I expected, but you should see this then the original. Solid Remake",Red Dawn
70,DanLives1980,Surprisingly original remake,6,29 August 2014,"So I've avoided watching this movie at all costs for two years, and when I saw it on the off-chance I was pleasantly surprised by its consistency; at least where it didn't fall flat on its face! Based on the original 1984 John Milius Cold War action fantasy of the same name, Red Dawn only really falls short in exactly the same ways its predecessor did. It's far-fetched, doesn't try to be too realistic outside of the action sequences and, most importantly, it's a smack in the face of all human intelligence on the other side of every ocean surrounding Muricah the Bootiful.If you loved the original for what it was, and I grew up on this stuff, you won't be too likely to hate on this. With a throwback theme of full-on action and guerilla warfare, Red Dawn updates not only its characters and story so that it isn't a cheap imitation, it also flips the wartime dynamic so that the lead characters of the movie aren't good ol' boy survivalists, but schoolkids turned ""terrorist insurgents"" by carrying out daring assaults on the invading forces and operating right under their noses.That's about as intelligent as it gets, turning things around so that American viewers might understand what it is to be treated like Middle-Easterners. Looking back to the classic, this version is shorter and more full of action and the action is exceptional, but it doesn't have the same level of desperation and heartbreak, although it doesn't dismiss it altogether.Surprisingly, the movie isn't filled with too many baby faces who look like they wouldn't know which end of a gun to point at the enemy. Those kids also make for pretty decent stuntmen. Chris Hemsworth and Adrianne Palicki pretty much run the show until Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Kenneth Choi and Matt Gerald join in and instantly turn up the charisma and I feel that it's all a lot better balanced than the original.As a standalone movie, it's good fun, even if it wasn't the brightest pupil in the yearbook. I'm pretty sure we can end the hate-offensive now. After all, Kim Jong-Un would have invaded by now had he found it that offensive!",Red Dawn
71,ksj870,Another remake that shouldn't have been made,3,18 April 2013,"So here we are with another Hollywood remake. The original Red Dawn was released in the 1980s and dealt with an invasion of mainland America by the Soviet Union, with a group of young resistance fighters as the protagonists. That film remains popular, and is a powerful study in American patriotism, the price of freedom, and the cost of war to invader and defender alike. The remake strives to capture some of the same elements, but fails on nearly every front.For one thing, the Soviet Union is no more, so our filmmakers had to decide on a different enemy. They chose North Korea. Now, North Korea's leaders may be evil enough to try something like that if they could, but there's just no way. North Korea is a threat to American interests in Asia and to our allies, and as such is a genuine military foe, but they could never pull of an invasion of the continental United States—they don't have any of the resources in terms of manpower, firepower, or logistics. Thing is, the scriptwriters seem to realize the hollow nature of the threat they have chosen to build their story around, and spend a lot of time explaining how North Korea is being helped by other powers (including Russia) and even gives them a ""secret weapon"" which is supposed to make it all feasible. It doesn't, and when some of the characters express disbelief that North Korea could pull off such a massive military coup, we the viewers have to agree with them. The plot is simply built on a ridiculous conceit that it can never recover from.But there are other problems. The protagonists are, as in the original movie, primarily teenagers and young adults. But the 80s film never lost sight of those same characters as fundamentally soldiers, if unconventional ones. The remake can't resist trying to adopt the style of modern teen films like Twilight. A teen romance is even established as one of the central plot points. There's also a sibling rivalry, but it's poorly conceived and never resonates like it should. For the most part, the characters fail to ever come to life, so it's hard to care whether they live or die, let alone if they reconcile their personal differences.The action scenes are plentiful, but lack the edge of the gritty, brutal battles from the original film. Instead, the remake gives us slick and senseless engagements that lack any real feeling of danger. There's even a stereotypical training montage that's supposed to make us believe we're seeing these kids go from helpless victims to lethal killing machines in the space of a couple of minutes. Once the fireworks start, the shoot-outs are well-staged but not particularly powerful. Rarely does any of the violence ever pack a real punch.The cast is handicapped by a very bad script which puts some atrocious dialog in everyone's mouth. By far the best performance goes to Chris Hemsworth, who fills in for Patrick Swayze from the original as the veteran who whips the younger characters into shape. Hemsworth does a credible job and at times brings some genuine pathos to the role, though his version of the character never manages to live up to Swayze's. Adrianne Palicki is the only other actor who distinguishes herself. The others—including Josh Peck as Hemsworth's little brother and Isabel Lucas as his girlfriend—never become more than stereotypes.Red Dawn could have been a successful remake. China should have been written in as the aggressor, and would have made for a much more believable modern opponent than North Korea. The characters should have been developed as American freedom fighters first and foremost, not as teen idols. And the story should have been a little nastier, because while one of the characters does try to explain to the others that war is ""hard"" and ""ugly"" none of the screenwriters apparently ever get the point. The movie isn't even particularly patriotic, and what could have been a rousing story of American exceptionalism becomes merely another action flick. If you're thinking of renting Red Dawn, my advice is to stick with the original. The remake is a poor imitation of its classic forebear."");",Red Dawn

However, since I have to fill 10 lines, Ill address some other reviews. For the armchair military strategists who say the story line isn't plausible, you should stick to your video games because you have no idea what you are talking about. As a retired special operations officer, I can assure you that you are wrong. The invading force wouldn't need ships as indicated in other reviews. They were very clearly inserting with cargo aircraft that would be loaded with support vehicles, supplies, etc. that would have been heavy dropped. Additionally, if you have any common sense, you would have observed that they destabilized US military infrastructure and acquired our assets (HMMWV, Mortars, Artillery, etc.). If you have such a negative attitude that you have to criticize every single thing, don't see this film. If you are up for a good time, go and enjoy.",Red Dawn
74,toddg-473-289818,Not as bad as critics would have you believe,6,24 July 2013,"While this remake of the 1984 original is no Oscar winner, it is a solid action movie with plenty of explosions and shoot out scenes. I remember being a teenager in Colorado (where the original Red Dawn was set) when the 1984 movie came out, and felt like I could identify with the school aged clan fighting back against communist forces. That was a different time in history, with the cold war still being fought and living very real fears of the powerful Soviet empire. Both the original and the remake inspire patriotic feelings, with a re-emphasis on our desire as Americans to be free. My only gripe about this film was its portrayal of North Korea as the enemy with whom the students engage in battle. My understanding is that the script was changed from its original enemy, who was likely China or a Muslim terrorist organization. And while there are economic reasons for making this change, i.e. many feature films bring in a majority of their gross revenues from outside the United States, there was clearly an element of political correctness in not portraying Muslim terrorists in a bad light. How pathetic of Hollywood to show this kind of weakness in a movie that is supposed to depict strength and courage.So if you set your expectations for watching an action flick without a lot of character depth, you won't be disappointed.",Red Dawn

It's just another a big, soulless military shoot-em-up adventure that will be forgotten by most everyone as soon as the end credits role. I can't believe how much I missed Patrick Swayze after seeing this.If you had a problem with the premise of the first one, it's best not to get involved in this. You could make a case in the Cold War days of the early '80s for a Soviet invasion of America. People did talk about that in those days. But you really can't say that in 2012 about the Chinese or the North Koreans , or whoever these guys are supposed to be. The Chinese have never shown an ability or desire to project power outside of their own sphere, and the North Koreans barely have enough gas to drive to Seoul, let alone invade the US mainland.

If the likes of Josh Peck's character are repressenting the good old USA then we don't have a leg to stand on. Let's igbore his hollow acting, choppy lines, and the fact that he looks like a mix between a stoner and a kid who is lost in the frozen food section of the grocery store looking for his monmy. His story was completely idiotic to anyone with half a brain, selling out his brother and comrades for his girlfriend, though i'm sure this storyline played well with tween airheads. All that aside, North Korea invading the USA, seriously? The underlying joke is it was originally going to be China but the studio didn't want to lose potential box office revenue in China, since it only grossed around $50 million worldwide, should have left China as the antagonist, may have lose a few $ but atleast it would have been believable. Atleast with the original we got two lines describing what is going on in the rest of the country and world, here we didn't even get that.1 star because that's the least I can give it.

77,spmact,An enjoyable popcorn flick. Why all the hate?,7,21 March 2013,"I don't know why there is so much hate for this movie. It's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. I watched this shortly after watching the 80s version, and I have to say that I enjoyed the new version much more.This one was more briskly paced, even though the invasion starts later. They did a good job of keeping the story moving forward without getting boring at times like the original tended to be. Having said that, there is still enough character development to get to relate to the teens and what they're going through - though the original version did a better job at relaying the struggles and fears of the main characters. There is also a good balance between action and dialogue, with a few humorous scenes and also some nods to the original in the form of similar scenes done in different ways.All in all it was an enjoyable film for what it is, and even though it had its far fetched moments, like the teens jumping down 20 foot heights more than once and just walking away from it, or the fact that the North Korean army could stage an invasion of the US (the original Chinese army version was more plausible), they didn't detract too much from the film. I would say give it a shot if you don't have unrealistic expectations given what kind of film it is, and you may be pleasantly surprised. I grew up in the 80s and think some classic films from that era should never be remade, but this one was an actual improvement over the original and I don't think it deserves all the hate it's getting.",Red Dawn
78,NavyOrion,I've seen worse movies... but not many,2,24 November 2012,"Combine an unbelievable situation with unconvincing acting and untalented direction, you get an unbelievably bad movie. Save yourself ten bucks. Go turn on TNT or Spike. A any given moment, one or the other of them is probably playing the original ""Red Dawn,"" which, weak as it is, is still worlds better than its 2012 remake.No, this is not an opinion drawn from a deep well of liberalism, as one reviewer / fan seems to think of anyone who hated this movie; I'll match my conservative credentials against yours anytime, buddy. Sometimes, bad is just bad.Sure, in a B-movie action flick, one BASED on a three-decade-old B-movie action flick, you have to plan on suspending your disbelief a bit, and ""Red Dawn"" 2012 certainly DOES ask you to dial back the ol' B.S. filters. That's fine, I can do that; if there's a good story, I'll believe whatever you want for two hours.But that's just the problem. If your idea of a good story means I have to willingly invest myself in the adventures of a group of incredibly stupid people opposing a larger but equally-stupid invading force, why should I care? It's not a battle of wits between skilled opponents, but just watching to see whose stupidity will bite them in the ass first. Will the heroes be caught in the painfully-obvious trap, or will they escape thanks to painfully-obvious flaws overlooked by their nemesis? Gee, I wonder.And no, having an explosion every ten minutes (as another fanboy reviewer correctly gushed) does not make up for the poor story-telling. I can look up explosions on YouTube if that's all I want. Nor does an overdose of shaky-cam (to the point you sometimes literally could not tell who you were seeing) compensate for poorly-choreographed action scenes. At best it is a failed attempt to disguise how bad those scenes are.Naturally, having nothing worthwhile to do must make acting pretty tough, but I'm not sure many of these people could have done any better no matter whose writing and direction they used. Chris Hemsworth will never do Shakespeare (if there is a merciful God) but he has proved that he is up to the challenge of a good action film (""The Avengers,"" ""Thor,"" ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") but here he looks understandably bored. The usually excellent Brett Cullen wisely gets himself killed early in the film before it can stain his career too badly. And Josh Hutcherson (late of ""The Hunger Games"") does OK with what he is given in a small role; he'll be one to watch once he outgrows his junior-high looks. But the remainder of the cast, especially -- and I cannot overstate ESPECIALLY-- ""Drake-and"" Josh Peck, should really look for other work. Please Josh, we're begging here. A career in fast food prep is just waiting for you.-- (SPOILER ALERT, if anyone could REALLY give a damn) -- The biggest entertainment value of this badly written, poorly acted, shakily-filmed movie will come within a few minutes of the end. If you've EVER seen an action movie director try to cram some pathos into a script, you should be able to call within SECONDS when ""Jed"" will die. Compete with your friends! See how close you can come! If you're more than five seconds off, you're just not paying attention. But don't feel bad for Hemsworth when this happens. Envy him; he's finally free.",Red Dawn

80,Rat_27,"Nothing to see here, move along ...",1,27 February 2013,"This movie was utter crap. And I liked the first one. And the first one, taken out of context, is not a very good movie. Allowing the suspension of disbelief long enough to believe that North Korea could occupy and significant land-mass, like they portrayed, there are still major areas of the movie that are just plain cartoonishly retarded.I will start with the munitions. I was concerned when I saw the minigun mounted on the Mustang in the commercials, and it proved to be as ridiculous as it looked for the brief second. I understand that miniguns are cool, and they look good on the bigscreen. They are cool because they fire a lot of bullets. I mean a BOATLOAD. Usually between 6 - 7.5K per minute, which is over 100 bullets in a second. The United States military mounts those things on helicopters and boats. Things that can carry hundreds of pounds of ammunition, and more. Not a sports coupe. I love Fords too. I have two, but that was just ... dumb. OK, sticking with munitions, there is a scene where Robert (I think. Maybe Jed) takes on a mounted .50 caliber with an M-249 SAW. The SAW, while formidable, fires a 5.56mm round. Effective range is 800m. The M2 HB fires a round that's a half-inch in diameter. They go for miles. They go through light structures and people very easily. Everybody on that rooftop should have been killed instantly. Otherwise, their ""enemy"" is just woefully incompetent.Jed rescues his girlfriend from a POW bus. ... What happened to everyone else on the bus? Were prisoners really that supportive of the escape of one other inmate that they sat calmly and waited to go back to a prison camp? And why does the Jeep chase the one escapee? And why is a car so much slower than two people on foot? ... And my final problem with that scene is ... why would the North Korean soldiers fire an RPG at two people on foot, when they also have rifles and light machine guns, which are ... for shooting people on foot. Not structures or vehicles? I don't like it when things are shown, just for the sake of showing them.Why does the town rally behind the ""Wolverines""? This concept worked in the original, because it was a small town. ... i.e., only ONE high-school football team. I am pretty sure that there is more than one high-school in Spokane, Washington. I also think that there is more graffiti in Spokane, so a couple of tags of ""Wolverines"" isn't really going to stick out.There is no effing way that they remain calm during the artillery barrage. Just ... none. And again, how incompetent were the North Korean troops that they failed to achieve that objective? They were portrayed as comically inefficient.This was a horrible remake. It didn't live up to any facet of the original, and does not function as a stand-alone. Perhaps if they had left the aggressors as the Chinese, it could have been slightly more plausible, but overall, this screenplay was garbage.",Red Dawn
81,lakings97,Not worthy your time!,3,8 July 2021,"Red Dawn is a remake not a reboot of the original version with Patrick Swayze, this one stars Chris Hemsworth who leads a group of teenagers to fight against the North Korean army in Spokane, Washington. The kids were played by Josh Hutcherson, Josh Peck, Isabel Lucas, Edwin Hodge and the gorgeous Adrienne Palicki. The script has the same dialogue as the original flick. The film was filled with plenty of action, a lot of firepower but lacked the depth and didn't bring the story to life.

The budget is obviously way above what they spent in '84. For one thing there's lots of CGI which didn't exist back then. The acting is good. The dialog is decent and the overall theme of the movie comes through just as well as with the original. Although at the time, 1984, we were still in the depth of the cold war.

So if you have seen the original and you compare it to this one, they both stink. Only this one stinks with better special effects. Suspending disbelief is pretty much a requirement for most movies to some degree, and I don't really know where you live and what it's like there, but before the first North Korean soldier could invade just my subdivision, the firepower he would encounter out the windows of all the second story bedrooms would be enough to flatten an infantry company, so an invasion of the entire US by North Korea is really a stretch.

Movies like this are clearly just thrown together with no passion or thought. Don't waste your time on this heap of garbage. The plot is worlds away from being believable to begin with, and every minute into this movie is less and less believable. In keeping this review as short as possible (because I could literally write a short story on how horrible this 'movie' is), I will just share with you all the one thing that angered me (literally) the most. Josh Peck. This little pansy, weasel, long haired girly- man was the icing on this poisoned cake. The scene where he abandoned his group to save his little girlfriend on the bus of prisoners was the moment where I had finally had more than I could take. You have got to be kidding me! A movie like this should be full of scenes of redemption, vigilante justice, payback, karma, destruction, honor and strength. But instead, it is filled with scenes like little girly- man Josh Peck and his feminine hair (the words I would need to describe this character are not permitted on IMDb, sadly). He runs around and dramatizes like a spoiled little child. The scene where he went running after his little girlfriend, like the little weak coward he is, was a slap in the face at best. This movie turns us against the ""good guys"" because their sheer cowardice and lack of courage and guts. The good guys should be exemplary people, but instead, some of them are like little man child's with guns. I'm not even near a movie director by any means, but common sense tells me that a movie like this should not be full of scenes that turn us against the good guys. They wasted so much time creating drama and hatred within the good guys instead of creating conflict between the enemy and the good guys. What a poor attempt to re-make a classic film. A sheer failure by all means. Don't waste your time.",Red Dawn

Would think it got the budget and green light because of Chris H, if it had not been for that I would say straight to DVD movie (did so in most countries) The 80s one at the time was a school boy/teen fav, but even when I was younger it was questioned (don't think its possible....but) and yet this was the time of Rambo and Commando, this sort of movie was the norm. For the film to be remade and set in a time where they can track one man from space, they somehow don't see a shed load of troops popping over to the states. Even if we take it as a movie, just silly action, it does not hold up for me, and when I start looking at my watch its not a good sign. The 80s one is worth seeing, silly 80s action flick, but fun, and the 2012 version is just stupid.

There are some departures and change-ups which were a surprise. There were some unique moments and a few laughs, but for the most part I just didn't care.

When comparing the original to the remake, the remake is just plain garbage. For example the original captured the genuine fear and paranoia of the 80's when it came to the cold war. Russia was a believable enemy or even China but North Korea? For those who aren't ignorant about these things would know that would never happen, so it all sounds ridiculous. Other than the ridiculous plot line, the film like so many other remakes doesn't have anything unique about it to set itself apart from the original. The Red Dawn of the 80's also had better acting, character development, emotion and a darker tone compared to the remake. Red Dawn (2012) has terrible acting and unlike the original, I didn't care if most of the characters lived or died other than Chris Hemsworth. Not even Thor or the modernized action sequences can salvage this piece.Overall, if you liked the original I can't see how you could like the remake.

I do understand that the original is FAR more liked and I do intend on watching it down the road, IN FACT even sooner that intended after watching this!Red Dawn is about a group of young, hip kids living in Spokane, Washington; life couldn't be more simple and carefree. Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck play Jed and Matt Eckert, the former of which, is a marine coming home after 6 years in Iraq. There are other, pointless, forgettable characters and Josh Hutcherson, who seemed really miscast in this movie, but more on that later. One day, out of the sky come North Korean infantry, guns a blazing and taking over the small Washington town and inevitably the entire Free World. However, Mr. Thor says nay and rounds up a random group of his little brother's class mates to fight the North Korean menace and take back their homes as The Wolverines!MAN! Talk about missed opportunity. I would be lying if I said that there weren't parts of this movie I didn't enjoy. Mindlessly, I gloss eyed over the explosions and the PREMISE of a foreign invader just up and taking over America, it's a scary but intriguing idea, again I will see the original film very soon. Sure, Chris Hemsworth is in it and he isn't too bad as the lead role, though there was one performance in this movie that stood out in a bad way. Josh Peck, was once the chubby kid on Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh show, where over exaggerated acting and attempt at comedy drowned his camera time. Now, he's 2nd to his on screen big bro Hemsworth and completely misses, his dramatic face is laughable, he can't deliver a good dramatic tone, and his character's story line with the girlfriend just angered me with it's unnecessary existence. Josh Hutcherson, you know the guy who starred in another 2012 movie before this one, The Hunger Games, should have played the young brother. He's no Colin Firth himself, but you'd think after being in the next big franchise like HG, the filmmakers here would've put him as second billing under the Son of Oden. Every other actor/character in this movie is throwaway, no character development with any of them mixed with bland dialog made me cringe at every scene that didn't have bullets flying.That was my biggest gripe, everything else just kind of adds a nasty smell to the Josh Peck turd. The film had a decent budget, I believe over 60K, and it doesn't really show. This movie looks like an overblown Michael Bay movie and at the same time feels really cheap. A darker color palate and perhaps some better camera work could give the movie a gorilla style look and add some much needed grit. There are plenty of action scenes, but with no emotional tension or care for any of the characters, it all seems pretty wasted. Now let me say, I didn't completely dread the entire viewing; like I said some of the action was pretty cool and the idea of a foreign attack effecting rural America could make for a pretty interesting movie. I can only rate this as an average action movie, hopefully watching Patrick Swayze kick some Russian butt will save the Red Dawn name for me.",Red Dawn
95,angiequidim,"Was fun to watch, but don't expect an Oscar nomination",6,23 November 2012,"By Ryan Binse www.thatsmye.com Jed Eckart, Iraq Veteran, is on a leave of absence from the Marine Corps when suddenly a blackout knocks out the United States. Wait a minute. That's no regular blackout. It's the North Koreans invading with some help from the Russians (Hooray Throwback!). With no time to waste, Jed takes his brother and a few of the neighborhood kids to safety. Now it's up to him to teach these teenagers what it's like to shoot, blow up, and kill the enemy.– A story of honor, courage, and determination.I had a lot of fun watching this film. A sense of patriotism could be felt throughout. The action sequences were methodic, suspenseful, and explosive. It's obvious some military trained personnel were on the set for this project, as you can see in some of the infiltration and attack scenes. The absence of CGI was a definite plus. While sitting in my seat, I was taken back to a time when filmmakers blew up things for real. I'm telling you almost every scene after the first ten minutes– EXPLOSION. Also, the choices for location assisted very well in creating the feel the filmmakers wanted to convey . The use of a peaceful middle class suburbia, a busy downtown district, and the ""old high school football field"" seemed to help elevate the stakes. All this amazement has a price tag on it though. I call it acting. As with many action movies, this is usually a lacking aspect. So, if you've read this far, I'll assume you already know it's an action film and performance is something you can easily forgive. I'll warn you though. The character arcs of the two brothers are the exact opposite and don't really serve Jed's character. With that said, the premise is also another aspect one should ""overlook"" to fully enjoy the film. Most of the characters in the story seem to work except for the foul-mouthed Marine. You'll know who I'm talking about when you see it. I'm done spoiling the movie. ""But why should I go and see this movie,"" you ask. Well In conclusion, I will leave you with two comments: 1. From the Critic: I felt I had to relax a lot to go along with the premise and the acting. That along with the forced ""military"" dialogue and the brother's feud, I would tell my friends that it was enjoyable, but not the best.2. From the Moviegoer: I got a little more than what I came for. Guns, bombs, hot chicks with rocket-propelled grenades, and a Banana Republic version of Thor.

96,Robin_clarke41,Nothing interesting happened,4,24 February 2013,"OK so the good news is that it's not really really terrible. It seems to be fairly well produced, the director did an OK job, the effects were OK, it has Chris Hemsworth and the acting isn't scyfy channel bad. Unfortunately those are all the positives I can draw on. From the get go the film never really bites. We are introduced to dull, lifeless cardboard cutout characters that never convey the desperate situation they find themselves in accurately enough for us to care. Obviously the story is ludicrous but hey it's a movie so you roll with it. Then there are the bad guys, in this case the North Koreans. What is their agenda? Hmm doesn't seem to be one, they just parachuted into a sleepy suburban town with tanks and armoured trucks to be beaten up by some pre-pubescent mall rats? OK, so if you've made it this far and you can oversee all that? The problem with this movie is that it is just very very dull. There are plenty of gun fights and action scenes (which I usually love!) but I just found it all done in a really boring way. I usually criticise my wife for this but I found myself texting and using Facebook on my phone, basically anything was more interesting than this movie. This is a big shame as the movie had potential and I'm a big Chris Hemsworth fan unfortunately though the big guy alone was not enough to save it. A solid four out of ten.",Red Dawn
97,benegesserit20,This movie is an insult,1,10 May 2014,"This review contains spoiler.Once upon a time, in a not too distant fictive future, North Korea in alliance with Russia invades and takes over the United States overnight. They arrive unnoticed and take the absolutely unprepared country by surprise. They not only occupy the most strategically relevant points but very casually the whole thing (a tiny 3.8 million square miles with an equally tiny population of about 320 million). Oh, did I mention that it happens overnight? The US Army is nowhere in evidence, apparently beaten. The rest of the world just sits tight. This is a lesson on a very well organized and very well funded war with excellent logistics, advanced level. With no lack of resources, first things first, they take over everything, including every middle-sized town. A part of the population is imprisoned, the rest still walks around, under heavy surveillance. But no reason for panic, Subway is still open.This is pretty much the basic scene, in which our heroes (a soldier and a couple of teenagers) manage to get away from the invaders, set up a guerrilla group and starts doing some chaos in the town (by far the most believable aspect of the movie by the way). As a top priority, the invading army tries everything to hunt them down and fails many times. In the meantime we can see things like: a major Russian officer makes an appearance in town, a female soldier starts screaming like a little girl when someone points a gun at her, some of the guerrilla squad falls, some retired soldiers arrive in town to ask help from the insurgents while we have the chance to witness the cheesiest lines in human history. But after some secret-weapon-stealing project and losing some more people (the most likable ones, naturally) finally, one of the kids give a very uplifting speech for a dozen of people, so we can rest assured that the day is going to be saved eventually.There is this one very funny line from one of the soldiers: ""This is not a plan, this is a sh*t sandwich without the bread.""

""Where's the military?"" ""Where are all the grown-ups?"" The major attempts at plot development are not explained.

Most of them sink within a moment's thought. It is as if they were paid to write negative conclusions about every single thing that happened on screen. Maybe the director or one of the actors wronged them in some way and this their way of exacting some revenge.The simple fact is that what they say doesn't reflect what is projected on the screen. Like spotty camera work. Sorry didn't happen. And don't they possess a modicum of disbelief? All matter of strange and bizarre events have taken place in a movie theater. Does the premise of the United States being occupied by foreign powers – meaning more than one – exceed these limits that have historical been extremely laid-back?Once clear of these little hiccups there is no turning back. The writing is engaging and at times really moving with a cast of characters that carry the action and drama to a degree that can be believed. From the vehicles, to the number of extras, and explosions it is clear that a great deal of expense went into the production. It would be a shame that a bunch of uppity hecklers would steer away a movie goer looking for a film that delivers PG-13 level action with some nice twists and turns, mixed in with a fair amount of drama and a little humor. If I were more cynical I might conclude that these naysayers just cannot stand Americans fighting for their county.

103,jimbo700,Pathetic Remake of a Bad Movie,2,2 March 2014,"I saw the original Red Dawn in theaters in 1984 and it was one of the first movies on which I regretted having wasted time and money. So I didn't bother when this movie was making its rounds. I took heed to the critics (and the IMDb masses) and for once it paid off. Fast forward to today. It's a snowy Sunday in the Midwest and I was bored. Scrolling through Netflix I stumbled onto Red Dawn (2012) and since I wasn't paying extra for the opportunity I decided to give it a go. Now, it's over and I was wrong. I DID pay for it by wasting 2 hours that could have been better spent watching Gigli or Disaster Movie. I have never universally rooted for bad guys in any motion picture until today. For 2 hours all I could think of was Ian McDiarmid's line from Star Wars EP-I, ""wipe them out... all of them"". The plot was weak (although the premise is still intriguing), the plot holes are too many to mention, the 'shaky-cam' made me seasick, Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack was bland, the acting mediocre, and CGI overload which normally covers a multitude of sins didn't help. If you want to see a bad movie, check out Red Dawn (1984). But it you want to see something really bad, watch Red Dawn (2012).",Red Dawn
104,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,A Laughably Atrocious Remake,2,2 December 2012,"Say what you will about the original, but it's a masterpiece compared to this atrocious mess. Terrible acting (I'm looking at you Josh Peck), no character development what so ever, bad pacing, tons of plot holes, and very poorly film with way too much shaky cam. I can suspend disbelief in films, but when a film ask me to suspend my disbelief even further after already accepting the incredibly implausible and dumb plot by doing more things that simply just don't make sense, it seems that the writers just believe that the audience is stupid and won't question anything and that pisses me off. I could've rolled with it if it was being played as an over-the-top silly B-Movie, but it's being played off as a dead serious war film that feels more like watching watching two rival gangs fight than the two opposing forces that are presented to us. The only positive thing I can say about it is that Chris Hemsworth was at least trying with what he had to work with and the film never slowed down despite the poorly pacing. The only way I could ever recommend someone to watch this is if they want to watch a film thats laughably bad. Another positive I can say about it is that for the first hour, me and my buddies were laughing non-stop at how terrible the film was, but after about an hour, there really is no more material to make fun off anymore and it becomes a pain to sit through the last 30 minutes that lead up to the incredibly bad ending that tryings to be an emotional cheap-shot to get the audience to feel sad despite the fact that we don't feel anything for these characters since they are all undeveloped and mostly unlikeable.

105,Junreviews,The most unrealistic and absurd movie I have ever watched,1,5 December 2012,"There are so many wrong things in the movie that it even make you think like you could make it better. Yes, it is about North Korea, the corrupted communism party known for notorious dictator and dogmatic leadership. The plot is about a group of high school students led by Jed Eckert (Chirs Hemsworth), a navy seal fights against the North Korean army to protect America. Sounds interesting? but it isn't. As a Korean, I literally scoffed and face palmed every moment as this movie blatantly shows disrespect and disgrace to both South and North Korea as well as forces in the states. Here are the reasons. Have you ever watched videos of a massive amount of North Korean troops marching down the street while getting cheered by thousands of citizens in Pyongyang? Unfortunately, the overwhelming charisma and attitude can not be found anywhere. First of all, they are not wearing the right uniform! They look more like South Korean army based on looks. Try to see the differences by searching ""North Korean army"" and ""South Korean army."" Also lax hostages going through an inspection by harmless and innocent-looking North Koreans make me giggle. Secondly, unclear and erratic narrations are a huge disappointment and a critical flaw of the movie. It is hard to understand the dialogues despite the subtitles (Even a few sentences are translated in a wrong way). Why? The North Koreans have this traditional accent and dialects that sound distinctly different from the South. In the movie, they stutter and mumble. Also the casting wise, it fails measurably, especially the actor who takes the role of leader of the North Korean army, Choi (Kenneth Choi) is a Korean-American who can barely speak Korean. I mean couldn't they at least find a decent native Korean actor? That is not the only factor that frustrating. It is extremely ironic to see Choi with spiky hair stiffened by gel. That is not something North Koreans do. And the rest of his subordinates do not even say a single sentence other than ""Attack!"" or ""Stop!"" The only good thing is you get to see a soft version of Thor along with illustrious young cast. Lastly, the way a novice group of trained high school students, aka ""Wolverines"" confronting...I mean sweeping the North Korean army that is supposed to be really aggressive and reckless as every solider dedicates their entire life to the military while remaining fearless enough to sacrifice their life anytime for the nation is beyond ridiculous.To move on to the production part, the script, Visual effects, and editing are abruptly done. They don't even show how clean-looking with zero injuries North Korean army manage to land in the U.S. across Pacific ocean and the border where mighty U.S. Navy and Air force are firmly deployed. The war..I mean the fight does not even involve a single American solider as if they are all defeated beforehand in their own soil. Also the story is one-sided as it focuses on reluctant dating partners and typical family issues than an the presence of North Koreans which even make some people leave in middle of the show. The amount of efforts they put in special effects is also unacceptable. Even with decent shooting scenes, there are hardly any blood splash and the way gun flashes look hand-touched. Also, viewing the invaded city filled with non-collapsed buildings covered with fake symbols of North Korea and cars in a fine condition driving on the road perplex me. A lot of negative elements that I have not mentioned are still untold. But since there is a maximum of 1000 words, and I don't want to make you guys bored from reading my review. I finish it off by recommending intense war movies that involve true North Korean's invasion. Check out ""Brotherhood"" and ""Joint Security Area JSA."" They are great enough to be more than substitutes of ""Red Dawn."" I realized how terrible movie can be produced if you don't plan it out thoroughly. This movie is a good example of that.",Red Dawn

However, it had none of the story and exposition of the original. And it did not feel near as patriotic as the original.One of the interesting points of the Swayze Dawn was how even the bad guys were fleshed out, to a point. You understood the conflicted feelings of the Cuban commander in the original. You knew the admiration and determination of the Russian commando in the original.Robert's angst, loss and eventual rabid reaction to the invaders was clear in the original.None of that was in this film. They even went to the point of comparing our patriots from the War of Independence, and the actions of the Wolverines, to the actions of the terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan.

107,Jipper2,"As Expected, Lacking in Depth and Human Realism",4,12 August 2013,"I loved the original Red Dawn. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made but it was a great action movie. The plot for this movie has so much potential that can be lived up to. The original did a good job but there was certainly room for improvements.When I first heard about the remake coming, I was initially excited. When I began to hear about the casting, I lost a lot of luster for this film. Chris Hemsworth isn't the worst pretty-boy actor out there but he's by no means a good actor. He's definitely an, ""in the moment"" pretty boy that will probably pass. Josh Hutcherson is just a flat out bad actor. The kid lacks emotion. Or at least the right emotion for the right scene. Josh Peck has actually turned out to be a good actor but the fat kid from Josh and Drake just isn't the right casting for a young Charlie Sheen's replacement.So when the trailers for the movie came out my worst fears appeared to be confirmed. The movie appeared to be action'd up, CGI'd up, glazed over depth and more of a paycheck movie than something someone in the making process actually felt inspired by. I didn't watch the remake I was once excited to see in theaters. After bad reviews I didn't even rent it on BluRay when it came out. Instead, I decided not to watch it. Eventually when TV watching was hard up and it was free I watched the movie. My worst fears were confirmed but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.The best way to describe this movie is with an analogy. The ""bad guys"" parachuting into the town would have been a powerful emotional scene if the bad CGI hadn't taken me out of it. Everything in this movie was close to being good but something (i.e. CGI, bad acting, pointless action, not reaching for enough depth) took me out of it and kept it from being as good as it could/should have been.Overall not horrible, but a below average movie. All this can be blamed on the director or whomever was controlling him. There was some bad acting. Chris Hemsworth was as usual, towing the line between descent and bad. Even that falls onto whoever was in charge of this project.4 of 10 - A lot of failed potential that overall just missed the mark.",Red Dawn

This movie moves WAY too fast, not allowing any build up of characters. There were certain homages to the original, that could've been done better had they built the characters up more.All the members of the Wolverines seemed to be already trained in weapons and tactics straight away, instead of the growing period. There was no timeline set like in the original. That one obviously took place over a period of months, this one seems like it happened over a period of days.Too bad, as the updating of the story was decent, and well set for modern times, I just wish they would've taken some time and really put meat on the bones here. This concept would be better suited for a Showtime or HBO 'Homeland' type mini series. NOW THERE'S A CONCEPT.",Red Dawn
109,poyrazbaklan,the silliness is excruciating,3,3 March 2013,"While the original Red Dawn was founded on a rather unlikely scenario (Soviets suddenly invading with no apparent battle plan, high school kids with no training takes up arms...)it was still a solid film with believable characters, a decent brothers in arms story with some cool action scenes. It is still a quality film, some bad acting aside. Even though it was highly improbable that a bunch of high school jocks would be tremendously successful with guerrilla tactics against a formidable enemy, still it ended on a more realistic note, patriotism and all. Pointing a gun skyward and yelling ""wolverines!"" is still a decent pop culture reference in the media. This remake on the other hand, does absolutely everything wrong, save the action scenes.(more on them later) It doesn't bother with making sense on a ground level, with highly militaristic North Korea being the big bad and being aided by the Russians. We are given a bit of explanation in the beginning, with U.N weakening with the economic downfall and the East expanding but that is all. How Korea drops hundreds of thousands of troops on U.S soil, and keeping it is unknown. Is this a global war? Nuclear apocalypse? What about U.S troops stationed abroad? In the original this sense of ignorance about global threat could explained by the main characters being stranded guerrillas, with no means of communications, here however they have functioning TVs and cell phones. In one scene the only believable character, the pretty boy marine big brother shuts off the TV, saying they have stuff to do. There is also no nice antagonist, the main bad guy is Captain Cho, who has maybe five lines of dialogue, and is disposed off rather easily(not a spoiler, you see it coming), we also have the Spetznaz commander, who has none, with maybe thirty seconds of screen time. To be fair, the action scenes are well done, with enough explosions and gunfire, and with enough Korean soldiers with stormtrooper aim being gunned down. But it is made all the worse by actors speaking really silly lines, and some generic marine characters left and right. Too bad one of them is jeffrey dean morgan, who usually boasts more charisma than that. And worst of all is the main character matt, who with his always sunken eyes and sad look, makes for a very,very bad leader for the resistance. In one scene he leaves his post to save his girlfriend, getting one of the gang killed and he mourns for a whole two seconds. In another one, they leave a guy who was with them the whole time, behind because the Russians put a tracker on him, which doesn't look very hard to cut out. (not that I'm a physician) The problem isn't the unbelievable concept, it is that the characters here take themselves too seriously, then five seconds later they do something silly or so vapid that you realize these are just high school kids playing call of duty on camera.(also mentioned by one of them) In the end, when it reaches a level where they just put a minigun on a blue sports car and go raid pow camps, where prisoners who already have huge flags in hand were waiting for them, you kind of expect the actors to go ahead and jump the shark with it.",Red Dawn

As an action movie this film is pretty much pitch perfect.It is well paced, the action scenes are well crafted and well shot, and it faithfully adheres to a pretty solid action movie formula (good guys vs bad guys, good guys need to undertake dangerous mission and overcome overwhelming odds in order to save the day, etc.) As far as film making in general goes, it's not a bad effort there either - good plot that doesn't get bogged down in pointless distractions; good character arc, pretty solid acting from all involved, etc.While this film isn't about a real war, and even though it's an action movie, it doesn't treat the subject matter lightly or turn the protagonists into superheroes (in fact, several of the main protagonists are dead by the film's end) with cheesy catchphrases either.Yes, there does have to be a certain sense of willing suspension of disbelief (which is true of any action film), like with the way in which they are so quickly able to train themselves into a cohesive insurgent fighting team, but at the same time this film also avoids cheesy pro-America rhetoric and silly clichés like the obligatory love-interest plots that are often inserted into films based merely on formula (in Red Dawn any of this stuff is there to serve the plot).It even manages to make a couple of profound statements about war - one is the rather obvious hint about American intervention on foreign soil and the whole notion of how would Americans feel if this happened to them (Ron Paul anyone?) Then there is the inclusion of the issue of collaboration with the invasion force by some of the invaded population, as well as a well crafted little 'ra,ra' speech about how war is pointless, but fighting for your home and family makes a little more sense of what you are doing.All in all this is a solid action flick that does a fairly good job at avoiding the usual team America propaganda, and more importantly it doesn't glorify war or turn the heroes into invincible fighters with cheesy one-liners.Glad I watched it.",Red Dawn

I seen better acting out of unpaid extra's in Matthew Broderick's ""Godzilla""! Peck's performance in Red Dawn made me feel bad...not for him, but his mother! Perhaps the worst performance in modern movie history.But Josh Peck looks like Gregory Peck compared to the pitiful Connor Cruise. Connor appeared genuinely scared...not of the invading North Koreans, but the camera! If he gets any meaningful work anytime soon, I'll kiss your ass.I wouldn't say the beginning of the movie was promising by any means, but the middle and end made the start look like ""Gone With the Wind"" by comparison. It started out with the actual game of high school football, rather than just a mention of the score like in the 1984 version (in both versions, both teams lost BTW). But the implausibility of the actions in the football game made you wish they had simply just mentioned the score too. Peck couldn't stop you from noticing his bad acting even with a helmet and shoulder pads on. And that was the ""good"" part of the movie! It got Troll-2-like bad after that.In the rugged, gritty 1984 version, you could feel the hunger of the kids, their fatigue, their anger, their uncleanliness. They ate everything from wild animals to cereal without milk. The women looked war-torn, disheveled. In this dud, the women apparently never ran out of lipstick or shampoo and the kids, get this, robbed a Subway for food! And because obvious product placement like robbing a Subway isn't quite enough, they called the guy behind the counter a ""Sandwich Specialist"" during the robbery. What was that, an extra $10,000 or so for that line to be throw in there?! Then, they eat like a typical bunch of teenagers at a party, simply throwing out leftovers. Nobody truly hungry would behave in that manner, kids or not. A single piece of rice is like gold to a hungry person. Then, when recounting the things they miss, they all mention something dumb, but one of the kids mentions Call of Duty. Really? Call of Duty, a video game about war, is on your mind when you're in an actual war? Come on. Atrocious writing. The writer just had to drop a video game reference in there, to be cool you know.One last thing that drew my ireThe scene in the original '84 classic when they shot the deer was heartfelt and memorable. In this version, I won't tell you what happened, but they could have just brought out a DVD of the '84 version and took a crap on it instead, would have worked about the same.This movie isn't worth the buffalo sh1t on a nickel!

Some critics ( this is what they like to call themselves, although I believe they are stuck up adolescents with hardly any worldly experiences) say the violence was too toned down.. well boohoo, a great movie doesn't need to be gory and contain large amounts of gratuitous violence, to be honest some movies do this because they are bad movies and have nothing else to offer.On another note, have any of the critics bashing this movie actually watched it from start to finish or have they just flicked through it enabling them to give their review? Here are an few shameful comments from the movie bashers""why would N. Korea invade a small US town..WTF?"" Duh.. they invaded most of the US... listen to the dialogue""Where is the US Army"" This was explained in the news footage montage at the start, the US army is scattered across the world, fighting conflicts in the middle east and other parts of the world... plus,they never expected an attack on their own soil""We couldn't stop laughing when the N. Korea military leader kept yelling ""The wolverine terrorists are attacking""Oh yeah, and I couldn't stop laughing at your comment! the plot was very simply, why couldn't you follow it? these radio transmissions came from the Korean Marine, made purposely to cause confusion... plus a little comic relief for the audience (the one's paying attention anyway)For the people saying that the story was unbelievable, i just don't have anything to say to you retards except... it's a movie, it's make believe, it's for entertainment.All in all a great popcorn movie, does it deserve the 10 I gave it? probably not, but a solid 8 easily, it gets the 10 the offset the unfounded 1's its been getting... what's wrong with people today",Red Dawn

120,wewilsons,Much better than expect. Excellent movie !,8,23 November 2012,"The first reviews were pretty negative so I expected not much. They must have watched a completely different movie than I saw. This was a great flick.From the start the characters were well played, decent and believable regular mainstreet people. The attack happens quickly enough to keep you guessing. What at first seemed to be a ridiculously implausible attack is explained using technology so readily available today as to be very scary. I do computer security for a living and what is cited in this movie not only exists now in many ways it is a real threat. I read this movie was made two years ago and sat on the shelf. Whoever made the decision to halt this movie should be fired.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) did a particularly fine acting job. His Thor and avengers fame was not luck, he is quite good. All throughout, the characters are very well developed, likable and believable. The situations they suffer through are real and the loosing battle situation they face is very likely. By the end of the movie I was still riveted and really fired up as was the rest of the theater, whistling and speaking out. I was not much a fan of the original but this was excellent. I loved it. Go see for your self",Red Dawn
121,PeaceAndLongLife,Decent action but a terrible plot,3,19 June 2018,"I'll give this movie a B for the action, but the plot was terrible. A EMF weapon manages to wreck the US economy and defense network (even the submarines are sunk) to the point that two third-rate military powers -- Russia and North Korea -- can invade the country. That's too much of a stretch.",Red Dawn
122,roythedog,An ugly defilement of the original,2,5 January 2021,"I was born way after the original red dawn came out but I have watched it many times. It was tear jerking, scary, and brutally realistic. The emotional and powerful performances really gave it a raw edge to it as well. This modern version of it absolutely doesn't even deserve to have the same name as the original. I do like how they updated the setting for the time this movie was made in, like North Koreans are the enemy rather than Russians for example. However, the cast is completely forgettable. The North Koreans have absolutely zero character development. In the original Red Dawn the main Cuban and main Russian despite not having a ton of screen time still had personalities and had a human side. This movie just portrays the North Koreans as evil barbaric savages. Plus not one of the performances in this movie was remotely good. It was just flat out boring and ruined the name of the original.",Red Dawn
123,reneemsm,Not great but not as bad as everyone is saying.,5,10 March 2013,"I rented this before seeing what everyone had said about it. I honestly didn't think it was that bad. The actor playing the brother (Matt) was absolutely horrible. How is he a paid actor? And who on earth thought he looked like he could be Chris Hemsworth's brother? Yikes. Not even close. I also thought a lot of the ""military jargon"" was a bit over the top, especially from the older Marine guys. And there was some definite over-acting at times from some of the kids. But I suppose they'll improve with experience.Otherwise though, it was a decent movie and I certainly didn't feel like I wasted my $5 by renting it. I have to laugh at the people saying they didn't like it because ""it could never happen"". You'd have to be pretty naive to believe that something like that could never happen. It happens all the time in other countries and we certainly aren't immune.",Red Dawn
124,devastationfilms1,Okay it was THAT bad guys. Chill out.,7,22 November 2012,"While I agree that with better writing and directing, this film could've been absolutely amazing, it's just a good movie, not an amazing one. There are many things I would've done differently, but it still was an enjoyable watch. Great graphics and effects and very good acting. I think the film moved way to fast in the beginning, but it began to slow down after about 15-20 minutes.Peck and Hemsworth put on an amazing performance, showing a real sense of ""sibling rivalry"" between them. Peck also does a great job of depicting his character as all this crap happens to him. I really enjoyed the acting without a doubt. Always been a fan of Hemsworth, Peck, and Hutcherson.The writing was pretty crappy at times, but not so bad that it makes you wanna leave, just kinda cheesy.All in all, this is a good one time watch, maybe even 2 or 3. It's a 7 star film for me.",Red Dawn
125,aequitas_veritas_007,A Patriotic Guys Movie,9,30 December 2013,"Before I start I will admit to the world that I have never seen the 1984 version of this movie with Swayze. While some might think that makes me ignorant for even attempting to rate this one, I would argue I watched this one with a clear mind and lower expectations making my rating much more true. I saw several previews for this movie, and didn't watch for quite a while because I did not think I would enjoy it quite as I did upon viewing. The film quality was good, the special effects were decent, and the story completely hilarious and yet entertaining. The acting was as good as a movie of this caliber can bare. While the story I found completely ridiculous and immature, the acting held up decently. This being said it was the characters that held my utmost attention. I enjoyed a movie that put itself forward as exactly nothing but a patriotic hard-on. It is an American in-your-face extravaganza at its best. As a red blooded male who eats steak I loved each and every minute of it. Overall a 9/10 and I will be buying this on BluRay/DVD.",Red Dawn
126,mickran,So horribly funny I couldn't even laugh.,1,1 March 2013,"In fairness I should point out before I start that this is only a review of the first ten minutes of the movie or so as I couldn't watch any more. I describe the first ten minutes only so I don't think this counts as a spoiler.So the movie starts with some very heavy handed breakneck speed storytelling. After some cliché's flickering TV news reel telling us how terrible North Korea is we're quickly introduced to a bunch of teenagers, played by much older actors for some reason, and in a big bar scene we're quickly thrown some hints of possible romance and sexual jealousy as well as a super quick reference to Iraq so we know who is going to be the leader of this band of teen heroes. The next morning suddenly we're propelled almost 50 years back in time and large WWII bombers are dropping thousands of soldiers out of parachutes into the small typically American town. Apparently they are actually North Korean soldiers invading the US. Seriously? Not with nuclear weapons or drones or computer hacking to cripple the US economy and infrastructure that we see them accused of every day in the news but somehow unnoticed they have flown across the Pacific and decided to do it old school, parachuting in thousands of troops to invade some small town. Although I've never seen the original I can guess the rest of the story as out band of teens are somehow going to defeat the 4th largest military in the world... who cares. I know this is supposed to be just a bit of fun but I can't have fun with something where the creators don't even seem convinced of their own proposal enough to think the basics through. It's just too dumb. I gave up at that point and switched it off.",Red Dawn
127,dmhughes-448-695102,Does This Surpass The Original? Well...,6,23 November 2012,"The original Red Dawn, released in 1984, is one of my all-time favorite cult classics. It was the first PG-13 film ever released. Its story about the Soviet Union invading the United States sounded like a generally plausible idea at the time, because the United States and Soviet Union were still engaged with each other in the Cold War. The original film was written and directed by John Milius, who also directed the film that jump-started Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Conan the Barbarian, and he also co-wrote Dirty Harry and Apocalypse Now, and created the HBO series Rome. The original film starred up-and-coming actors like Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Gray, and also had film veterans Harry Dean Stanton and Powers Booth as supporting cast members. The premise was simple: a bunch of high school students escape to the mountains near Calumet, Colorado after the Soviets, Cubans, and Nicaraguans take over the town in the first days of World War III. The students quickly grow into adults as they decide to fight the bad guys and try to free their fellow townspeople, naming themselves the Wolverines after their high school mascot. They get help from an American jet pilot, cause lots of chaos, but eventually, the group gets worn out, they begin to drop like flies, and eventually the leaders of the group, Jed and Robert Eckert (Swayze and Sheen), sacrifice themselves to save the survivors of the Wolverines, and the members of the group become national heroes. Red Dawn was filled with cheesy dialogue, some pretty laughable special effects, the same music was played over and over again, and some of the actors' performances made me want to cringe and say, ""Did that actor really become a star?"" Even so, the film is a guilty pleasure in its own right, and it's one of my favorite films from the early 1980s. When the word came out that MGM was producing a remake, I got really excited. We were promised an action film showing the U.S. being invaded by the Chinese (a potential possibility), and a new generation of actors donning the Wolverines name and fighting for freedom. Until 2010 that is, when MGM went bankrupt, and the film was shelved for two years, and then some scenes had to be re-shot, and the Chinese had to be digitally edited to become North Korean for the fear that China wouldn't want to show the movie in their theaters. So, after two years on the shelf, is Red Dawn (2012) really worth the price of admission? Yes...and no.In true remake fashion, the original story remains relatively the same; the world is struck by depression, rising political powerhouses, etc. In Spokane, Washington (I'm sensing a Twilight vibe), Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) has come home from a tour of duty in the Marines. His brother Matt (Josh Peck) is a quarterback of the Wolverine football team. The morning after the game, the North Koreans, with the help of the Russians, launch an invasion of the United States, and take over the town, while the Eckert brothers and some other teenage survivors (Josh Hutcherson, Connor Cruise) flee into the mountains, and decide to fight the bad guys, and call themselves the Wolverines, and...I have a strange feeling I've seen this before. Red Dawn is a passable remake at best. The plot pretty much borrows straight from the original, although the remake does change some plot points for the audience's amusement, but what makes this film stand out is its action scenes. They're actually pretty exciting and well done; the scene with the cargo planes over the town was pretty impressive, and the Wolverines' attacking the North Koreans in a modern day guerrilla combat style actually worked to the film's advantage. The actors are surprisingly good, except Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas, they're just eye-candy, and Jeffery Dean Morgan is sadly underused as Lt. Colonel Andy Tanner. The film actually has an ending far different from the original, and it left me quite pleased.Overall, Red Dawn is a decent remake, but I still prefer the original for its campy qualities. The last generation had the original with Patrick Swayze, the current generation gets Thor as their hero. This is a Red Dawn with really good special effects and some impressive performances, but unfortunately, this is just a remake. It doesn't take risks with the plot, the bad guys are stereotypical bad guys, and when the Wolverines start to die off, you have no real emotional connection to them as much as the original. Also, why couldn't the bad guys be Chinese? It would've been more realistic. Overall, this is a decent remake that unfortunately didn't really survive its long shelf life, and has the feeling that its story and themes are thirty years out of date. It's not bad, it's passable, but I'd recommend going to see Skyfall or watch the original instead.Final Verdict: 6/10",Red Dawn
128,newtonpost,Bum-clenchingly bad!!,2,13 March 2013,"Saw this in the US in December.Plot holes that you can drive a tank through; e.g. how does impoverished North Korea fly 4 million troops to invade the US - not enough planes on the planet and how is it that this vast, imaginary armada is invisible to radar, as the invasion is a total surprise? How is a lowly NK Captain (the primary villain), in charge of the thousands of troops that invade and hold the local town?The script matches the plot line and the acting follows the script. If you want to see a ""Reds under the beds"" paranoia film, I suggest you look at some of the 1950's B movie classics.Quite probably the worst film I saw last year, with no redeeming features.",Red Dawn

Not meant to be awe inspiring , win any Oscars this is just a standard film to take you away from the hum drum of life .Surprisingly better than the original (not often I say that) , it's never going to be realistic , the might of a huge invading force against a group of insurgents who are all young adults, unable to cope with their knowledge of the area and constant raids. At least on this occasion the leader Chris Hemson is a military man unlike the Patrick Swayze lead in the original. There are not many twists from the original storyline , the action is better along with the effects . Sit back , relax and remember its a film , not real , not meant to be real , just to take you to a different place away from the daily grind for its duration.",Red Dawn

When they are doing everything they can to survive and scrape by, you feel their hunger and just wish someone would bring them some food.ReMake: its the Jed Ekhart show. the whole idea behind the ""WOLVERINES"" was Jed's idea, to fight was Jed's idea. You see hardly any character building of the antagonist, the enemy doesn't seem to care to follow the ""wolverines"" into the woods. So wolverines come in to town, blow some stuff up....and then the Koreans are just like....""those wascalwee wabbits!"" Also there seems to be almost no turmoil in our protagonists at all, except for Matt Ekhart...who wont stop acting like a little baby till he gets his girl friend back.if you like action movies that just have some decent fight scenes, then you will like it. if you were looking for a rebirth of an amazing story, watch the original.",Red Dawn

The concept is still silly but given the parameters it establishes, everything works well. They jump right in to it with very little set up or character development. There are a few tries at creating emotional ties as the film unfolds but this is where the remake falls way short of the original. The action and tactics in this film are clearly better, however. Speaking of the original, this movie really could have used the memorial rock where the names of the Wolverines were placed after they fell in battle.SPOILER SPOILER: The fate of Chris Hemsworth's character really drags my overall rating for the film.

140,davidnhewko,Not entirely necessary but still a good way to kill a couple of hours.,5,6 March 2013,"Mindset before movie: I watched the first ""Red Dawn"" for the first time about 2 years ago. I enjoyed it, it had some really good action and the story is a great idea. Was I surprised there would be some sort of follow up? Not really. I was pretty excited to find out Hemsworth was in it, ""Cabin In The Woods"" and ""Thor"", his career is shaping up nicely. The recent remakes and sequels have shown me that the passion of making a good movie is more and more becoming the passion of making a good buck with the 'real' filmmakers being way too few with far between, with that in mind my expectations were hopeful but in doubt.Mindset after movie: Not bad. I felt a strong presence of the original throughout with the wardrobe, haircuts and action sequences. Hollywood decided to take the original and mix it up with some more current events while ignoring some of the military and technological advances of the past 30 years(because then they would have had to re-write a lot more of the story and who wants to put in that kind of effort?) The action was just as solid and of course the special effects were a lot better. My biggest problem with this movie, as it exists with many others coming out of post-production these days, is the way too over-dramatic acting. I've yet to meet anybody in the real world who talks or responds to situations in any style resembling these types of characters, I know it's a movie, it just makes it hard to relate to the characters I'm supposed to relate to. I found myself not even caring about the characters (I don't blame the actors because they all acted this way... which means the fault lies between producers, director and writer(s)). I was still sucked in by a story good enough to justify all the crazy action sequences, I even caught myself cheering aloud at some of the scenes; there were some really good ones.If you're like me and are a big fan of the original ""Red Dawn"" you will probably find the new ""Red Dawn"" is a lot like the old one, just a little more current. If you couldn't give two craps about the original's existence and you like action, you will enjoy this movie because it has most of what you're looking for. I'm still not sure if this remake(or whatever) was entirely necessary but Hollywood is running out of ideas so everything is necessary, apparently. The ideas don't have to be good, they just have to make money.......our world is dying...",Red Dawn

It wasn't much, it wasn't nuanced, but it was something.

Now see the original red dawn to me is one of the best 80s movies ever definitely in the top 10 for me personally. Now this remake is just that a remake the acting was ok action could have been better but it wasn't a horrible move let that be clear. But i feel this would have been a great even superb remake if it was with an R rating and completely dove into its action and violence. This was made by a stunt man an experienced one i want to see what he can do action wise unchained this story would have been perfect for that. Overall its a half baked movie not to say there isn't potential though definitely i think this is a story that can be done way better and with justice to the original one.,Red Dawn

145,Danielramos16,Another half baked Remake inferior to the original,2,9 December 2012,"This is a case were curiosity gets the better of me. I own the original Red Dawn from 1984 on DVD. I was a big fan of that movie which today has become a cult classic. I knew this remake was gonna be bad, yet I went to see it with some friends simply cause its an action flick. My advise, keep you expectations low and understand what this film is. It's a silly film, it was fun, but trust me it's still a bad film. The storyline, the pacing, the acting, Character development an execution is really bad. I think Red Dawn (2012) could have been so much better with the right people involved in the project, instead things just seem half baked or not well thought out. In the end we get a cliché action flick with the feel of a B-Movie.The Original Red Dawn from 1984 was set during the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. So as far fetched as it was it was ""small"" possibility that the Soviet Union and it's communist allies could invade the United States. I guess many saw it as a worst case scenario. In the remake the invaders were originally suppose to be Chinese, but at the last minute the film makers changed the invaders to North Koreans. Being that China would ban any film that depicts them as in such a hostile manner, the film makers made an attempt to get this film into the lucrative Chinese market. Well i didn't work. Even in the near future how would North Korea Invade the United States? That idea seems so ludicrous seeing how North Korea is a small country that is basically bankrupt, and struggling to feed it's own people In the film its suggested that the North Koreans are part of a multi-national coalition, so their assisted by stronger nations like Russia & China. Still how the hell could they bring their forces across the ocean, and how could the United States with it's capabilities not notice a massive buildup of that magnitude. Based on what I saw in the film the enemy invades within less then a day which is quite impossible. The North Koreans come off more like bond villains then the ruthless professional army they are known to be. They also aren't wearing North Korean Army uniforms. The story line seems half baked, and they throw in this last minute plot near the end with the Marines. The acting is pretty bland and boring. It seemed like a bunch of young model looking brats running around looking cool with guns. The bad guys are over the top and the good guys are underwhelming. We really don't know these people except for the brothers. On the other hand the original is far more developed in it's story, characters, and action scenes. Also the original had a much more darker & serious tone then the over the top cliché style of this remake.How would I have done this film? Well the North Koreans should be more of a supporting role as auxiliary troops like the Cubans & Nicaraguans were to the Soviets in the original Red Dawn. The Invaders should have been Russians in a large coalition. Even after the end of the Cold War our relations with Russia are fragile even sometimes hostile, and it would keep in style with the original. In respect the invaders should be treated with more humanity so the film doesn't come across as over the top American patriotism and like were demonizing other countries. Instead of being set in Spokane, Washington I would like to see a major city such as New York City or Los Angeles being invaded. I would like to incorporate themes like 9/11, the War on Terror, the Iraq War, the Occupy movement, so as to make this a more meaningful film in todays standards. Yes the original Red Dawn was silly but the characters were well thought out, the action was great, the story was well written. Red Dawn (2012) could have been a much better film, unfortunately we just get another stupid remake of a superior film. Watch this film somewhere for free just for a laugh.",Red Dawn

If you are someone who saw the original and thought it was cool but like me, wouldn't mind seeing an updated version this isn't a bad one. I actually like some of it better then that original (The ending for one thing...which I always thought was a weakness of the original.) I much prefer how the remake ended and there are some action sequences that are to die for. Oh and the females in this have a larger role which is always good in my book.

147,Blazs91,One of the rare moments when a movie could have made me disappointed so hard...,4,1 October 2014,"Let's start with the good stuff. There are not so many of them The initial feeling of the movie is quite reassuring with a typical American genre: boys are playing football, girls are cheering, and after that they occupy the bar in order to chill out, and then everybody goes home to relax, and so on. But not so much later the intimate peace will be broken by a sudden Korean invasion, which was illustrated in a flawlessly brutal and dramatic way. The movie has its nice number of clichés, but near the end it provides us a so sudden turn, that we cannot take in immediately, so it totally reimburses the experience being distorted by clichés.And now, let's put the weaknesses under the microscope, because there are plenty of them! This movie is incredibly unrealistic! Such things swarming all over the productions that I simply cannot took up.Chris Hemsworth and his freshly gained teenage transform into a ruthless and unbelievably crafty death squad at a glance, that hardly need any nourishment, because they are so tough. But why would not they be so? Since their number is barely a dozen, but nonetheless they can smoothly annihilate the whole sanguinary Korean army occupying the whole town, who seems not to be really disturbed by that, but only at the beginning, when the Chris Hemsworth killing machine children were totally inoffensive. At the very beginning of the movie the Korean military tried to do everything in order catch these juveniles. I don't know why, but they were so important that the far East enemies rushed through the open streets with their off-road cars smashing everything that got into their way, and they eliminated one of their close friend too. But they gave it up really early. The youngsters take the soldiers down without a hitch, so that the film completely loses its seriousness. But it would have much more potential, and they could have made the movie more enthralling by improving the dramatic tension. It's a pity!The storyline was not completely right either. At the very beginning the movie draws up the events in an appropriate rhythm, but after a short time is starts to move forward in the story too rapidly, so that we would feel a bit unaccustomed compared to the initial part. So they rushed the movies time-line a little bit.Too many characters were crammed in the 1,5 hour runtime, whom you eventually will not get to know half as much as you would like to. Some of them have been given too much roles, while the others could not get the chance to prevail, because they hardly can be seen on the screen. Otherwise, the acting performance was quite good, but the only problem was that the actors haven't been given enough time to get their talents and skills coming up to the surface. Furthermore the only realistic and credible character was Robert Kitner (played by Josh Hutcherson), who was at least a bit chilled to the bones because of the happenings, and he was the only one being anxious about shooting people of flesh and blood, and only he could have not been able to master the skill of dealing with a rifle instantly. But unfortunately it only lasted a short time period.Everybody can hit me on my face (including girls too), BUT Josh Peck's acting was simply nerve-racking for me. During the 10 minutes of the movie we saw his teeth more often than his opened eyes, because amid his blinking he was not able scrape that arrogant smile off his face, which made him look like somebody in half sleeping status and just dreaming something nasty. But when the invasion was about getting started, he changed his attitude a little bit, but later he was about to disappoint me again.And once again the women! They bring the men to the grave again. In other words (before I get myself killed by the ladies), not only the women are the guilty! Men and Women jointly put many likable characters in the grave, who wouldn't need to die. The only purpose of the only pretty boy of the movie is to rescue the beautiful blonde princess, who does not even know how to grip a gun and pull the trigger (but she will acquire skill instantly of course). But he is certainly more valuable than all the people who passed away for this reason.Unfortunately, Chris Hemsworth's role is exhausted by playing the toughest soldier who appoints himself the leader of the team. I do not blame the actor, because I loved him in Thor, Star Trek and Rush, so I got to know his talent. But simply there was hardly a short scene when he could have used his acting talent in order to show the audience what he is actually able to perform. The dialogues throughout almost the whole film were painfully simple, they barely squeezed some creativity and genuineness into them. There was only one good train of thought in the whole production which I liked, Chris Hemsworth makes an attempt to motivate the youngsters to fight. Buti t was imitated by the extremely smart and creative character by Josh Peck later, which totally destroyed the originality of that quote.Sorry for being outrageous and revolting, but this was one of those rare moments, when I had fair expectation toward a movie, which was hardly able to satisfy me. But all of these opinions were my own experience, and you might love this movie, so I didn't intend to dishearten anybody! Go, watch it, and get your own experience!",Red Dawn

The original Red Dawn had a bunch of 'kids' defending the good old US of A from those Commies, after a Russian invasion, this time it's those even nastier Commies, the North Koreans who invade.The whole premise is laughable with no insight into just how North Korea has managed a land invasion on US soil, just where are all the US troops, surely if the US felt an invasion or attack was possible, a nuclear strike would have been threatened?The whole film is laughable in the wrong sense, utter nonsense, pathetic flag waving BS and a total disregard for any logic whatsoever.",Red Dawn
152,follis12,"Not as memorable as the original, but fun (possible spoilers)",6,26 November 2012,"I suspect the new version will not be remembered by this generation in the way the original is today. The 1984 version was a better reflection of the times. The US and USSR were deep into the cold war, and both were focused on the eventual showdown. A lot of Americans were pretty sure a shooting war was coming, but didn't know what it would look like. Red Dawn (1984) gave us a scenario to ponder, and it was very intriguing. If you are too young to remember this it is difficult to explain, but it was a genuine concern.The new version is the same story without the relevance. They tried, but the idea of North Korea invading the US seems absurd compared to the 1984 scenario. I heard the original plot had China as the aggressor. If they would have stuck with that, it may have come closer. Bottom line:The new is an entertaining action movie, but it fails to reflect any true fears of our time. The original did both.",Red Dawn
153,brad_mcmillan,Better than being water boarded,3,11 May 2013,"With a bunch of stuff happening around the world (as shown by the movies opening montage of news footage taken out of context) something has happened and North Korea can afford to invade the US. But they aren't invading any part particularly important, they are invading a town with a population less than a back alley in New York.So what is the good old boys of that town supposed to do? Well, read the Al Quaeda wiki article and follow suit of course. Those silly Koreans who are perfectly willing to starve millions of their people to death and execute thousands for no apparent reason don't have the nuts to track down and kill some teenagers with AK47s. I mean, torturing a few residents might actually get you the info you need but throughout the whole movie the Korean occupying force seems more gracious and hospitable than Sesame Street during a block party. Oh no, its a checkpoint, oh no, some guards drinking a latte with Americans who are also drinking a latte. Oh no, everybody is going about their day to day lives like nothing ever happened. Oh the humanity. There is even a prison for political prisoners but it looks even better than the prisons the US has now. ""March in line to your tent of you won't get your moca latte and porno you lazy American prisoner!"".Where the hell is the US army? Where is that one F-35 they need to end the war? I don't get it. So we have an extremely half-ass invasion on the worst possible target by some relatively pretty nice North Koreans and there is not one US tank anywhere...Eventually, it came time to kill some collaborators and blow up some buildings downtown. But it is cool, they didn't show any kids getting killed in the crossfire like what happens in Iraq when you blow up a building in real life. Because after all, if you actually showed the downside of ""freedom fighting"" AKA TERRORISM the irony would be too obvious and the main characters would look like assholes. So no armless toddlers and babies hit buy stray bullets during one of their many gun fights with NK soldiers in the middle of busy city streets. Nothing to see here folks, fighting back is not alright for Iraqis, but super cool for Americans because American terrorists don't accidentally kill kids with indiscriminate bombings and gun fights. EVER Maybe next time the North Koreans can tactically strike major cities and Army bases, land an amphibious invasion force on the coast and strafe across the country like a real invasion force would do. Maybe.Maybe next time the producers can pick a movie to redo that wasn't already stupid and ridiculous to begin with.I suggest this movie to anybody that wants a mindless action flick.I also suggest this movie to really really really stupid people that use pseudo-political movies like these to base their entire political ideology on.",Red Dawn

156,gaelicguy,The Chaos theory plays out in Spokane.,6,13 November 2012,"One of the basic tenets of the chaos theory is that events are deterministic, suggesting that, given initial conditions, events are not susceptible to randomness. However, it is this precise determinism that, paradoxically, does NOT make them predictable at all, but vulnerable to chaos. This is the key premise to director Dan Bradley's ""Red Dawn."" Chris Hemsworth, (Jed Eckert) a US Marine, has recently returned to his native Spokane, after a six year tour of duty in Iraq. His father, Tom Eckert (Brett Cullen) is the city's chief of police. Chris's younger brother, Matt, (Josh Peck) looks up to his older brother, whom he thinks heroic. The brothers, along with Danny (Edwin Hodge), Matt's best friend, Robert (Josh Hutcherson), tech guru extraordinaries and Daryl (Connor Cruise) Robert's best friend and the mayor's son, are a close cadre and live and enjoy a relatively typical and happy existence in their small corner of the city. Matt has a girlfriend, Erica (Isabel Lucas) and then there's the 'no nonsense' Toni (Adrianne Palicki) who has eyes for Chris. One quiet morning, the city is besieged by air and on land, by a group of North Korean militia and Chris and company finds themselves prisoners under enemy occupation. Chris determined to fight back at all costs, because as he says, the fight is on their home turf and, ""When you're fighting for your family, it all hurts a little less and makes a little more sense"" takes full command. The group galvanizes and the games begin. ""Red Dawn"" is an updated version of 1984 cult classic, which several teen icons of the 1980s. Of course, these were the waning days of Soviet Russia, but what with President Ronald Reagan calling the Soviet Union, an ""evil empire,"" the plot, in its day had great resonance. Dan Bradley, making his directorial debut, has selected material that suits him. His years of experience as stunt coordinator, serve him very well. As action films go, this is a perfectly adequate film, with impressive special effects, and all of the attendant trappings of the genre – tanks, AKA 47's and all manner of weapons, but for the faint of heart, take note. The film contains several protracted scenes that are very violent, some a bit gratuitous and ear plugs might come in handy, as well. The film, in Dolby 88, may have some scurrying for aspirin - the action scenes are exceedingly loud. However, the cast deliver uniformly good performances, and, as is so often the case, there are the usual twists and turns and a few surprises. The film's fundamental concept would have made for an excellent political thriller. However, Bradley says that, in comparison to its 1984 counterpart, the 2012 version of ""Red Dawn,"" the invasion seemed ""an apt metaphor"" for the unease Americans feel about the world today and opines that, ""Americans just don't feel as secure as they once were."" Perhaps, without having heard of it, Americans are, increasingly, subscribing to the afore-mentioned chaos theory.",Red Dawn
157,tomsan84,"in short, its oke if you have low expectations",6,21 February 2013,"Saw the title come by somewhere and went on to IMDb to check it. The ratings and comments almost made me move on, but it was late I wasn't bothered to look for something else.If one is to critique this as a serious movie, then yes this is quite bad. dialog, script are retarded. semi-lead role josh peck was really horrible, as well as some other actors. But since there hardly was any dialog it wasn't that bothering. There isn't really a story in this movie, virtually no time is spend on introduction of characters and very limited background is given on motivation or decisions.Now the above doesn't mention anything good, but I still pretty much enjoyed the whole movie. as far as the story line goes its very simple and takes place in a very small area. its very orderly in a sense. The movie jumps into action almost immediately and then keeps on being packed with action with properly timed breathers. In the end they take the action a tad to far imo, but 'meh' its oke and it fits. I was never bored and enjoyed the action, which looked pretty good (also camera work was decent).So in conclusion: -partly bad acting, but hardly any dialog to notice -no real story line, but if you can ignore the ""why's"" then the story is just fine (simple but fine). -no character development, but with all that action who needs it -good visuals -good camera work -loads of actionI would say; watch it if you feel like such a movie. the concept is pretty funny, an invasion in your western home land.

It doesn't even feel like the same story. They did a good job of relating the film to present day. How it would really be if the USA was taken over RIGHT now. Chris Hemsworth's character - JED, leads the film. I'm a big fan of Thor and it was great to see him doing something like this. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the whole time. There is a few ""all is lost moments."" Then the story lifts you back up again and shows you that there is hope. Honestly, I think they should've changed the characters names from the original and just completely did their own thing with it. On the other hand, there was a big following from the original so I can see why they did that. There is EXPLOSIONS, GUNS, PRIDE, HONOR, RESPECT, COURAGE. If you like that kind of stuff, you'll love this movie.There are some anti-war people who don't like this movie. That's fine, stay away from it please. It definitely wasn't meant for you.

160,Taylor_Gillen,Another mediocre action flick,5,17 March 2013,"Movies like this can be fun when you have low expectations, but they won't make you think. In fact, while watching it, you might even feel a bit dulled. Once again, Hollywood cranks out another so-so film that makes you say, ""eh, at least they tried."" Here are some frustrating things:The characters are unbelievably underdeveloped. The brothers conveniently have two women to cling to, which is another predictable element of a modern Hollywood action movie: you can always be sure that there will be romance awkwardly put in somewhere. The pack of ""Wolverines"" consist of the main characters such as Chris Hemsworth, Josh Peck, and Josh Hutcherson, and then a bunch of other people thrown in there that you can't identify well or relate to. You can easily tell who is likely to die and who is likely to live in the next shootout by how many lines they have spoken. It almost seems that these people are there to simply fill up space.The plot accelerates too quickly. Not even a minute after the invasion, the neighborhood boys are ready to go with their convoy and supplies. It almost seems like they were waiting for an invasion to happen so they would have an excuse to fight for something. In fact, I fear a lot of young men in this country really do hope for the day that a foreign country invades so they can shoot people and be able to justify it. Not only does the plot accelerate too quickly, but the movie is not long enough. This would be more suitable for a series, but is packed into an hour and a half. This makes things rushed, and good moments breeze by.This movie is disgustingly patriotic. The Koreans are portrayed as evildoers with nothing better to do than coerce other people into being like them. As if the American military doesn't do that in the Middle East by ""establishing democracies to better the people"". In fact, the Koreans barely show up in the film except for when they are targets for AK-47 bullets. Their side is not really explained, so most people just who they are by a single word: socialists. This movie certainly appeals to young men that love guns, guerrilla warfare, and of course, the fantasy that one day they might be able to live the life of a ""Wolverine"", shooting up Koreans and sneaking around.I do need to point out some positive aspects of the film, since I rated it 5 stars and not 3.

It is obvious that soon a united force of Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Thai and probably Mongolian and of course some Russian alliance will form to attack the USA. This evil alliance invades the US with a special and very difficult war technique, that is probably known only among real war dogs: So this is how it's done. And I hope, that I won't be banned from IMDb for revealing such classified military information. So please guys, don't try to conquer USA this way at home: All you need is just some big planes, all of them hiding in the clouds for weeks. At day 0, just appear like from nothing everywhere in the air. And with a special super electric burst, just eliminate all communication systems. Now a with a surprise parachute attack, soldiers can conquer the US within 3 minutes, shooting from the air. Of course they would attack civilians only. Why? Because this way, US military is not involved! How smart! I mean, some of the soldiers probably don't even know they have been invaded. See: no communication, no idea what's going on. USA's weak spot! The country is totally helpless! What can they do? Nothing! Check mate.Now the real and stunning story: It begins, when a couple of high school students decide to free the country. They are outnumbered by whole armies of course. As the main character says, they have to be smart. And they are! They decide to use heroic-guerrilla techniques, which is much different then classic guerrilla techniques. You see, classic guerrilla would demand you hiding and attacking from distance, preparing bombs in the shadows and placing them at night. The heroic-guerrilla-techniques do all this, but in plain sight! And of course it involves opening fire on hundreds of soldiers with only a couple of teenagers. Why does it work? Because and true heroism can't be defeated and only the guilty hide! That deep message within this movie really got to me! Of course, the story gets complicated, when one of the teenagers wants to free his blond girlfriend. This way, he puts all his team at risk. And for what? For love! So it is also a love story, that broke my heart! And the blond was so convincing! I felt in love with her the moment I saw her on the bus. Definitely Oscar material!Well, some of you would think, this movie is a little bit discriminating, because the Asians seem to be the bad guys here  and the Russians  and the black mayor. But I think it is not discriminating. Because, the movie doesn't tell you whom to hate! The Koreans, the Russians  or the Chinese  or the black mayor. It's good, the movie doesn't discriminate just one race or country. It's totally up to you, whom to hate. You may want to hate all Asians or Russians. You may even want to hate yourself. That shows real quality, that you have that choice. I liked that philosophy on that movie and decided to hate myself in this situation. I was so angry at me! Thank you movie makers!The movie has a lot of shootings, bombs and so forth. The whole time I was like: ""whoooo ... explosions ... cool! Ohhh, bad Asians, you are so mean, leave them alone ... ohhhh, love story, how neat, I want to cry. Ohhh, bad Russians, go away. Oh look, bombs again. Kill them .... ratatatatata ... ohhh yeah!"" It's good that the movie ends with the teenagers showing the piece symbol. That's the real message of the movie I guess.

Its knocked out originally for the attack but then does it ever come back.

The scene from the original where he kills daryl is awesome.They definitely lightened things up a bit overall. The original has just about everyone dying and this one only has about 3 or 4 of them getting killed.The gun fights and guerilla attacks are pretty good. They are frequent and keep the pace going pretty well. Of course its nice to have the hottie from Friday Night Lights and Isabel Lucas in the cast. The acting is decent except for a couple weird scenes with Josh Peck. I liked that Helmsworth is back from Iraq which gives the group a little more military background.

172,melina-m-gunnett,Red Dawn Redeux,3,14 November 2012,"I can't wait for the new Red Dawn to come out on video. Okay maybe I'll wait for it to hit Netflix. Either way it is going to make a great drinking game. One rule – Every time you see or hear an overused cliché or war trope, drink. You'll be soused 15 minutes into the film. On the up side, the rest of the movie will probably be better that way.One of my friends that saw the movie with me summed it up nicely. OMG, it really is a remake. Up until we actually started watching the movie she had been holding out hope that they had re-done the movie and fixed the oh so many problems the first Red Dawn had.The original Red Dawn had its place. I remember seeing it back when it came out. It had all the hot young actors of the day. It's problem wasn't the cast, all of them were good actors, most when on to long successful careers. I suspect many of the actors from this movie will do the same. (I'd tell you who was in it, but I suspect they are already hoping that people forget that they were involved.) The problem wasn't even the concept. Everyone loves an underdog story and there is nothing more under-doggy than a bunch of high schoolers trying to fight back against overwhelming odds. They could have handled the concept, lets be generous and only say, A LOT better. To their credit the writers did try to fill in some of the plot holes for the remake.They setting was moved from some agricultural town in Colorado to Spokane, which at least has an airbase and decommissioned missile silos that might make it a strategic site if someone was to invade the United States. They also made the point that the kids weren't trying to beat the invaders, but act as insurgents, making trouble where they could.The new movie does offer a nice training montage and lots of high quality explosions. Sadly the dialogue is just as painful to listen to as it was in the first movie. Too bad they didn't spend a bit less on the pyrotechnics and a little more on the script, but hey, it does have a lot of things that blow up.BANG! POW! BLAST!

In my opinion I thought it was much better than the first version filmed sometime back in the mid 1980's. This movie, like all such movies, tends to stretch the imagination a bit of what could be accomplished in such an actual event but it is exciting to watch. I thought that all the actors did a great job in making their characters seem authentic. I would recommend this film to anyone who liked the original as well as other similar type story lines.

176,rottninge,The anti-thesis protagonist opinion!,6,17 January 2016,"I have noticed (it's not hard) that this movie is getting thrashed for being so much worse than the 1984 original. It seems like a lot of reviewers might grew up with the Dirty Dancing casted 1984 version. I had never seen the 1984 or the 2012 versions but did so yesterday (2012 version) and today (1984 original).First, the 1984 release has a 6,3 and the 2012 remake has a 5.4 rating. That's not a huge difference.Josh Peck has received a massive amount of hate for his performance. Yes, the casting of him is weird and his performance is not solid, but I can remind you that good acting was not overrepresented in the 1984 version either. No, Josh Peck doesn't look like a brother to Chris Hemsworth but does Charlie Sheen look like a brother of Patrick Swayze?The new film gets criticism for unrealistic warfare tactics (and outcomes)... But I couldn't really find less of it in the old original...So here's what I did. I had a bad day and needed something where I don't have to think too much, I get into my 12-year old mode and enjoy the ride (People! It's a bunch of kids killing hundreds of trained soldiers that has superior fire power, one has do dumb down first!). It worked, and was a prerequisite for BOTH versions.",Red Dawn
177,Evil-Lee-666,Stick to the Original,5,23 February 2013,Firstly the very talented Chris Hemsworth & Jeffrey Dean Morgan could not carry this film alone....not with this supporting cast & the storyline that must have been written by 2 drug crazed teenagers that want to put the World to rights. The movie started off very promising with the News reports & clips that were used but it went downhill & fast when we were presented with Josh Peck & his miserable face.Talking of Josh Peck......I cant say anything about this sour faced prune without getting into a rant about young talent that could have done a good job over his appalling effort.Josh Hutcherson played a very like able character (just like he did in The Hunger Games) who's development throughout the movie I enjoyed.Kenneth Choi & Matt Gerald were very good but this is expected from 2 seasoned Actors with the decent Film Bio that they have.The rest of the cast were OK but overall it was a very lacklustre performance on the whole.The 1 thing I cannot forgive is the scenes where they are using Sniper Rifles with Telescopic Sights & firing these weapons very accurately WITH BOTH EYES OPEN......not a chance in a month of Sundays would you hit ANYTHING firing a weapon like that. Whoever the Military Consultant was he did not do his job and should therefore not get paid.Overall I was deeply saddened by this Movie after all the original was fantastic to say the least.,Red Dawn

Its not that I don't enjoy the odd badly made B-Movie every now and then but this thing is just plain awful. The Script is full of holes and 99% of the time their actions don't make the least bit of sense. After narrowly escaping from an attack on their hidden base will camp out in the woods with an open fire going ... yeah, that seems smart. Not to mention the fact that NOT ONCE during the entire movie anybody actually reloads a gun. Kind of reminded me of Chuck Norris of the early 90s. While the soviet threat has worked in the original from the 80s the idea that the north Koreans invade the mainland US is absurd to begin with.",Red Dawn
179,GoldenShadow5184,Horrible movie,2,4 February 2013,"Having not seen the original Red Dawn (with Patrick Swayze and C. Thomas Howell), I could still tell that that movie definitely did not need a remake! Starting off with the plot; I find it hard to believe that the US would be able to suffer an Invasion by North Korea. It just isn't believable. Yes, movies like Spider-Man and Superman and any other superhero movie are also not believable as actually happening for real (you have to admit). But with this sort of film, you would expect it to at least be believable. Unfortunately, it is not.....and the plot isn't the only thing wrong with this movie. The Cast. The cast proved to be one of the dilemmas that this film had faced and it cannot go unnoticed. Chris Hemsworth is a good actor (I liked him as Thor and also liked him in Cabin in the Woods) but he was just boring in this film. No depth at all (just like all the other characters). Josh Peck....was not really familiar with him before this movie, but I really didn't care about his character in this movie. Without moving forward with the rest of the cast, I will just say that none of them were good. Maybe some weren't that bad....but at the same time, also not that good. None of the characters had any depth to them and made it hard for us to sympathize with them and get emotionally engaged with their characters. The only reason I'm going to give this movie two stars and not one, is because some, and only some, of the action scenes were probably a bit decent. The fight scene between the North Korean leader and Chris Hemsworth was not good at all though, and was so cringe-worthy with all the shaky cam going on. Overall, this was a movie which should have never been made (I should check out the original some time down the road). 2/10",Red Dawn

181,tddiscodriver,This is science fiction and very very bad science fiction,1,16 July 2019,"I finally sat down to watch this, I was expecting it to be bad but nothing prepared me for just how big a pile steaming cow manure it would turn out too be
OK. North Korea invade the US, a country that cant feed its self or produce electricity to light up the whole country is some how able to invade the whole Pacific coast of the US. With some help from the Russians who provided ""hardware and aircraft"".
The invasion starts with paratroopers dropping on the city of Spokane Washington from what look to be Antonov AN-12, and 1 been shot down from a low flying F-16 (One just one, slow moving plane on a steady heading). I'll stop here for a minute just to point out a few things:
Distance from North Korea to Spokane about 5170 miles, flightpath would have been over main land Japan and no one noticed hundreds of slow moving Soviet/Russian military aircraft heading East?! I say Soviet aircraft because the An-12 was produced from 1957 - 1973 in the Soviet Union. A total of 1248 were produced and exported to several countries around the world, North Korea was not one of them.
So everyone in Japan was asleep and didn't see hundreds of planes in the sky over head heading East, the An-12 can carry about 60 paratroopers, fully loaded has a range of 2236 miles and a cruising speed of about 300miles an hour. Flight time from North Korea to Spokane just over 17 hours, not including weather consideration and having to refuel at least twice along to way. So now lots of An-12 and now refueling aircraft are flying across the Pacific and no one saw them, radar did not detect them and they manage to reach Spokane.
Wow, the audience is really meant to be stupid.So our heros seeing paratroopers dropping from the sky jump in their pickup and go charging through their neighbors back yards and crash sideways into captured US Army HUMVEEs. Boy these North Korean guys work fast they are still falling from the sky and they already have wheels and they even remembered to bring North Korean decals to stick over the US Flag on their new HUMVEEs, these guys think of everything!
Spokane seems to be the one city in America where no one owns a gun!
What happened, how did this happen? Enter Jeffrey Dean Morgan after about an hour to give us an explanation and boy what a story, The US was hit with a ""New Class of Weapon"" that causes a massive electrical pulse that took everything off line and never came back. EMP is not a new weapon and its not new science. And military hardware such as Ships, Submarines and aircraft can be protected or ""hardened"" against such weapons and are.
Cities were taken out with ""tactical non nuke warheads"" fancy way of saying bombs. YOU MEAN BOMBS Jeffrey.
One might think he is talking about the Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power nicknamed the ""Father of All Bombs"" (but I'm only guessing) for sure will ruin your day but one is not going to destroy a city, so are we to believe that Russia carpet bombed several US cities?
And then we find out the North Koreans were able to protect their electrical equipment with and special laptop in a briefcase!!! Of course it makes complete sense now... what the f£%k
This is so bad on so many levels its a real slap in the face for anyone who has a little bit of common sense. Its bad and really lazy writing, its nonexistent science physics and devoid of and fun or humor.
Its not just silly and stupid, its offensive in the way it treats its audience and maybe that's why this was Dan Bradley first, only and hopefully last time he will ever be allowed to direct a movie. Stick to being a stunt coordinator Dan! PLEASE

182,wolverine34,Watchable but some worries were correct,5,16 March 2013,"I really don't understand why people moan about films like this being unrealistic. All films are for entertainment, if they made them real there wouldn't be many films made. I would also miss films like The Avengers and that would suck! Just a point. Original had Cuba invade America with help from China. This one had N Korea invade with help from Russia. Russia & China are as big as America. Just a wee point for fact based realists.The only worry I had was how it would live up to the original. I think if people haven't seen the 1984 version, they may enjoy this better. Unfortunately I am a fan of the original and this is another film remake that doesn't do the first one justice.Don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad, but there is a lot that it fails on.I felt the first allowed you to get to know and relate to the characters more. There are some reviews I agree on, Josh Peck really wasn't too convincing with the character Charlie Sheen played. Chris Hemsworth done a reasonable job on the Patrick Swayze character, but I felt for Patrick's character more.The same goes for the character Robert, originally played by C. Thomas Howell. This was one of the main characters in the 1984 film. There wasn't the same intensity with Josh Hutcherson. I don't blame the actors for this but the writers and director.Each character grew on you in the original and you liked, loved, or hated them. I didn't get that feeling for any of the ones in this version.This film was obviously rushed in production, and it just didn't flow as good as the original. There was nowhere near as much tension. In fact I don't think there was enough at all never mind compared to the original.I give this a 5 cause it is watchable and people will enjoy it, but was miles away from being better or even as close to the 1984 version. It saddens me to see remakes like this as they obviously just try to cash in on the popularity of the classic.Having someone who hasn't Directed before maybe didn't help. Too late now, unless someone gambles on another remake. I just hope if someone takes another one of my favourite films that they can actually do it justice.Just felt I had to write this as I am a fan of the 1984 film and disappointed in another ballsed up remake (although don't agree that it is that bad).",Red Dawn

The drama more though out and acted. With the exception of Peck (who really wasn't that bad), he just seemed forced.

The acting is solid enough, action is OK. Fortunately, the movie a good job at creating an apocalyptic foreign invasion. I will say that it is a decent re-make. It was funny how they tweaked the deer's blood scene from the original movie. If you are looking for a good movie to see over thanksgiving, I would recommend Lincoln or Bond 23.

I wasn't fully expecting the lead to turn out to be the person it was (which is good) and there is enough going on to keep it exciting. Unfortunately we don't really learn enough about what is going on to have actually triggered the invasion, what the bloody weapon actually was or (new kind of EMP doesn't cut it for me) why it didn't affect the North Korean Forces.That said, and forgetting that Chris Hemsworths Hair doesn't grow any longer or get shorter throughout the film (and yet everyone else's does) it's not actually bad. There are a load of references to the old film, plenty of action, plenty of shooting, and they even point out how unreliably crap machine pistols can be. Its one of those films that will either sit well with your film instinct or not, its gonna be marmite :-) Some people are forgetting that this film represents only a snapshot of the invasion, in the same way that United Forces peace keeping in Afgahnistan wasn't limited to a ten mile radius. Also like another reviewer said, it is entirely possible for a group of normal teenagers, children and adults to create a situation which make occupation untenable (vietnam) and at the very least fight Gorilla Style.

The opening invasion scenes were very promising, but it went sadly downhill from there. The story arc of Matt Eckert was awful. There were absolutely zero plot twists, the most surprising part was when Jed was killed. But who shot him? I mean come on, the star of the movie gets killed by a ""loud bang"" out of nowhere, it's like the producers were making this up as they went. There was never a feeling of a big ""show down"" brewing, no climax. No character repertoire, just a big sterile, loud, jerky camera waste of time.

A lot of reviews say it was unrealistic that these teens where taking over ""the whole north Korea army"" although if they paid attention the troops in this small town were only a small faction as the majority of the troops would be in the larger cities. Okay some of the acting was poor, especially from Peck but I have to say I overall enjoyed the action sequences. I feel the film makers didn't know their target audience. They should of directed it at teens, with a happy ending for all the cast. But i just though it was silly that in the last 12 minutes they killed off two of the main characters for no reason. The guy Daryl was left to die (he didn't get to be reunited with his father) & Jed, straight after finally making peace with his bro, gets killed. Up until that moment i was seriously considering giving the movie a solid 7. This movie could of been saved by three simple changes. 1.) After they get the device the military guys escape back to the free zone, tamper with the device and use it on the Koreans. 2.) Daryl gets reunited with his father and some of the other Wolverines could be reunited with some of their loved ones. 3.)

This might be due to the fact that there are absolutely no good actors which could have made at least something out of the storyline.Also the ""emotional"" speeches from the group leaders to align the citizens were nothing but hot air and not one point where the audience was deeply moved.All in all, a highly disappointing movie.

The only thing I could never get over was that the invading army was North Korea. The reason for the change was that they producers didn't want to offend China. So they change the bad guys to North Koreans. I guess the producers didn't have a problem offending the US Military. This film basically states that the US Military can't fight a tiny nation such as North Korea. The next premise of the film is that they are able to invade the US by using a EMP weapon that knocks the power out in the US. Apparently this weapon also sinks the US submarines. Considering the US mainland is around 3000 miles wide, this EMP has an extremely long range. It would have knocked out commms in south America as well. There was never any mention how this weapon was delivered, via missle, via person, etc... Also the idea of it sinking all the US submarines is ludicrous as well because are we to assume that all the US submarines are in the same location. In addition, even if the US mainland was out of commission, there are roughly 4000 US Aircraft in the Pacific with more than enough ships in Hawaii to be able to twart any attack from North Korea. An those commands in Hawaii, Japan, and Korea would be able to immediately see a fleet of airplanes heading to the US. The same would apply to China as well. True they have a billion people but their performance in the Korean War was mediocre at best. Look at the Battle of Chosin where 200,000 Chinese attacked the 25,000 strong 1st Marine Division. True china won that battle but they lost over 40% of their force killed and another 40% wounded. Militarily none of the three powers in Asia, China, Russia, and North Korea have strong enough Navies to be able to not only defeat the US Pacific Fleet but also to transport the amount of Personnel required for an invasion of Mainland US. True they could use Nukes and destroy every single city but again they wouldn't be able land on the Eastern shore and conquer the US.

There are several positives, as well as a few negatives, with this one, and I'll review it as a remake instead of a stand-alone movie.For starters, it IS a remake. Originalists will always be there and have fits simply for nostalgia's sake, so ignore them. Yes, I am old enough to have watched the original in theaters and on VHS. It was a great movie, but this updated version is just as worthy.The opening in this movie was better. Rather than a few generalized words on the screen, they used news clips (both real and fake) to build the backdrop: The recession, Europe's financial collapse, terrorism, Arab uprisings, etc. The use of speech clips by current politicians (Hilary Clinton/Biden/Obama) also helped add to draw the audience in, and I can't help wondering if the director would have used the change of command had Romney won to add to the backdrop. The only drawback is that it dates the movie when those politicians retire.Coming off of two wars where insurgency was a focus, I thought making Jed a Marine and combat vet was fitting. There were other factors, such as the ""un-retired"" Marines, that also worked well. Chris Hemsworth was fine, but he had some Swayze-sized shoes to fill. Turns out those shoes were a bit too big for him. On the flip side, Josh Peck (surprisingly) did a better job in his character than Charlie Sheen did 23 years ago. Adrianne Palicki was also good, but all the other characters were forgettable, though I blame at least half of that on the writers, not the actors. At 114 minutes, the movie STILL seemed too rushed. I would have liked another half-hour for character development and a bit more action. Bottom line, it's worth your time, especially if you liked the original.",Red Dawn
204,Ty-Tim,Irritating Movie,1,27 February 2013,"Another American movie where Americans try to make themselves look good. An entire N.Korean army being terrorized by a bunch of bratty teens living in a small town. The director is really trying hard to entertain us with all the machine guns and explosions, but instead he is making us look like fools for sitting an entire 2hrs for some uncreative piece of crap that they call RED DAWN. the characters are annoying especially Josh Peck with his stoner face. He can't even reveal the right emotions for the role he's given. The only reason i sat through this movie is because I needed to pass time so I could get ready for work. It would have been better if I just sat there staring at my wall. The characters make you want to jump into the screen and smack them all because they are not giving me what I paid for. Chris Hemsworth really tried to save this movie, but nothing came of it. I'm shocked it's rated higher than BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 3.DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE, PLEASE!!!",Red Dawn

I missed the showing I initially was going to attend of flight and the next one was not for another 2 hours, so it was either watching this or twilight in the mean time. I should've listened to my sister and stuck with the gay vampires. Josh Pecks performance was comical.. it is beyond me how in the world he got a lead role. Chris Hemsworth should stick to thor. and hutcherson to hunger games. Josh Peck should probably do the world a favor and find another job. everything about this movie was just ridiculous, from the cheesy speeches to the whole Korea invading us, to the gun battles, to the romantic scenes... i honestly found myself laughing out loud because the ""sad"" moments were so poorly acted that it was indeed comical.... just awful.. don't waste your time and money, go watch django if you haven't.. or literally ANY other movie out right now will be better then this abysmal.",Red Dawn

But I am realizing that it's not that I hate every movie, I just don't go with the flow.Take this movie, for example. I found it quite enjoyable! The story does not make any sense? Yes, this is true. But this is the starting point, not the goal. That a bunch of teens becomes trained marines overnight is not realistic? That is very true; but this could be said for more or less all the movies in this genre.What I liked in this movie is that people died! I am sick and tired to see all this war movies where: if you are the hero - you are bullet proof. OK, you get beaten a lot, but you are invincible. I hate it. Where bullets are flying around and bombs explode, you are gonna get killed. Even if you are a good looking champ.And furthermore, not all happy ending have to be perfect! Not all ending have to be happy, if I might add. Here, at least, there is no magic button or miracle solution, that makes all bad go away.It is not a realistic movie. Far from it.

The cast was great, the acting was impressive and the story was good. I should have walked away on a high, but I didn't. Then it dawned on me. I new what was wrong with this movie and I new whom to blame. This movie was destined to fail the moment the director tried to make it into a family action movie. This movie should have been moving and powerful, instead I found it lifeless. I did not care about the characters or what they where going threw. I was just watching mildly entertaining gunfights.

208,sjjvdberg,Was this second-rate propaganda movie funded by the CIA?,1,15 February 2014,"Just about the worst piece of US propaganda I've watched -- tried to watch -- in a long time. Obviously aimed at the very average 12-year old American boy. Tiny budget does not excuse such a bad film -- it was obviously all shot on the town square and two street corners in some American hick town. For a moment I thought it might have been shot on the cheap in the Cape Town movie precinct down the road from me, but it's too amateurish for that. Which shouldn't matter. Unfortunately it shows. Why export this drivel to the rest of the world? The CIA can surely do better when they invest through dummy companies in propaganda movies.

209,Piceased,Honestly Shocked,10,19 April 2013,"The reviews I've read about this movie and previous movies (see my review for Vampire Journals) has proved to me, and should prove to you, that you can't take the advice of a review. You must just see the movie and decide for yourself. I've learned over the years that sometimes you must just watch a movie and stop trying to read or think to much into the plot -that's when you start to dislike something. This is a fictional movie, not a documentary. Not everything is meant to be completely believable.I can honestly say that I LOVED the movie. My mother, who has seen the original, did as well. I liked the fact that it was teenagers trying to take back what was theirs -they weren't your typical whiny, ""why us"" bunch who just sit back and wait for their parents to rescue them. The acting was fairly good in my opinion. Then again, Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are in my favorite actors list.I could pretty much see what was coming throughout most of the movie, one of the few downfalls. But I was completely caught off guard when Jed was killed. I kept looking at my mother and asking ""He's not dead, right? He's just knocked out, right?"". Though the transition from reckless teenager to leader was a little fast, I liked how Matt stepped up and took control of the team.Now, the ending. The ending seemed a little...open to me. They never really completed the story. A pet peeve of mine. But it seems they were leaving it for the possibility of a sequel with the room to back out if they wanted to.Still, if you aren't the type to try and read too much into a plot or expect every detail to be on the dot, you should definitely give this a shot.",Red Dawn

Some people are saying it's ""copying"" 'tomorrow, when the war began'. This film is a re-make. The original was made is 1984. 'Tomorrow, when the war began' came out in 2010! The film will always have you on the balls of your feet, grabbing your attention straight away. There were some emotional scenes in the film and i haven't got a bad word to say about the movie.

211,ilovesnakes1990,Underrated,10,5 June 2020,A very underrated movie thought it was awesome and a well done remake of the Patrick Swayze classic,Red Dawn
212,pdkenny-1,Fortress Hollywood rises again,5,16 April 2013,"This Hollywood made movie is much like many things from the Korean peninsula, (the peninsula that gave us ""Gangnam Style""), it defies explanation. Once I heard that there was a RED DAWN remake of the 1984 version (except the Soviets and Cubans were replaced by North Koreans and Russians), I wasn't expecting much. And in this this movie exceeded my expectations.Yes, it is very unlikely that the North Koreans could invade the mainland of the United States, but I understand that the original antagonist was suppose to be Communist China, until the Peoples Republic caught wind of the plot and threatened the movie producer. But knowing this and still seeing the movie then ones expectations should be moderated.So for a quick plot recap, the North Koreans invade the Western USA while Russia apparently invades the Eastern Coastline. A bunch of high school students in Spokane form a guerrilla group calling themselves the ""Wolverines"" after their high school nick name.Yes, the plot is somewhat unrealistic. But there are several good points about the movie.1. The acting was not as all around bad as some of the others would have you believe. The acting was OK. Chris Hemsworth (Jed Eckert) was pretty good, and his acting skills salvaged the movie. Also there was some good supporting acting from Brett Cullen (Eckert's Dad), Michael Beach (The mayor) and Jeffery Dean Morgan (the Soldier). Will Yun Lee played a menacing Captain Cho and showed his best acting when under pressure from his general (that story should have been developed more). In some sense it was like Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas were in the wrong movie, but that was probably due to the weakness of the plot.2. While watching the movie and realizing that we (the USA) are just concluding military incursions into Iraq and Afghanistan. In both of those countries we have experienced insurgency problems, whose insurgents were likely saying the same things to their people that the Hemsworth character was saying to the Wolverines. So in a strange sense this is the movie of the occupied made in a way where those people are sympathetic to the viewer. It is a perspective which one does not get in American movies.3. The 1984 RED DAWN is an artifact of a time when an invasion of America was more plausible. It was so much more in American popular culture that there were actually board games made on the subject such as ""Invasion America"" and ""Fortress America,"" (games where the communist world gangs up and attacks the USA). This is THE MOVIE for those games.Many of the reviewers were exceptionally hard on the movie, so I am guessing that they were expecting some other type of movie. If you can suspend common sense for the premise and not take the movie too seriously then its not a bad rental. I am sure this movie will become very inexpensive. When it does I might pick it up and keep it in my copy of Fortress America.The truth is I've seen movies that were a lot worst.",Red Dawn

There is nothing good about this movie, it has no saving graces. The acting, directing, story, script, props, you name it are terrible. It's no wonder MGM almost went out of business financing a piece of garage like this. It is total trash like this that makes me not care one bit if the entire Hollywood system gets turned on its head like the music industry did, these morons expect people to pay their hard earned money for this junk and wonder why more people don't go to the theater.

The movie starts off with an odd but very quick pacing which took a little getting used to but once accustomed to was fine. The camera work during the beginning car chase was awful but thankfully the camera work seemed to improve during the course of the movie. The acting was solid all the way through from the whole cast. These things made the movie quite entertaining, until the end. The ending of the movie is supposed to be patriotic and I see that but it came at such an awful time in relation to the plot. I walked out of the theater frustrated and annoyed just like everyone I saw it with it. Would it have killed the director to add another 10 minutes onto the movie to giving a sensible ending?

The actors and actresses all played their roles exceptionally well. A lot of people complained about Josh Peck's acting, but I found he nailed his role of a slightly irritating yet likable younger brother. Chris Hemsworth, obviously, did a fantastic job just as he did as Thor and the rest of the characters brought a great deal of variety and emotion into the group. The plot of the film was simple yet engaging, leaving the audience to attach the the characters and therefore feel for them throughout the film. I can't understand for a second why people called this film 'racist'. It shouldn't be offensive to the Americans, Koreans or Russians. It was an inoffensive war related movie and if people could sit back and enjoy the action film for what it is, rather than criticizing and scouring for flaws it would've received the far greater reviews it deserves.

I have no idea why they chose Josh Peck for one of the male leads. He makes Hayden Christiansen look like Marlon Brando in his prime. Now that I think about it, I might even have to suggest seeing that new Twilight instead of this. I know that's pretty extreme, but trust me it's really that bad. It also makes sense that this was filmed back in 2009 and just now is being released. In hindsight, the studio should've just cut its losses and canned this thing for good.

This remake gave us the same basic story, but with some different characters, a different country invading, and some very good acting. I figured Thor, Wonder Woman, and Peta (the actors not the characters) would do a great job but I was pleasantly surprised (shocked even) at what a great job of acting Josh Peck did.Honestly, I don't understand the bad reviews this movie seems to be getting.1: The story line was solid. 2: The acting was excellent. 3: The special effects were very good. 4: The pace was good.

Right from the beginning its paramilitary escalation Koreas rise, then right to the grid iron and one older brother soldier and let the explosions fly. Even if this was the original I would still hate but maybe 5% less. What made, at least the intro, of the original is that i had zero setup.

As a fan of the original movie with Patrick Swayze, I figured this would be worth a look but whereas the original had some character development and believability seen into the plot, where teenagers are - at least initially - emotionally tormented at having to kill. This version has one kid puking after their first raid... and that's it. Emotional guilt dealt with.
Josh Peck - who looks like he's suffering a stroke throughout the movie - is terrible and his character's actions even worse. His self-centered nature is apparent from the start, when he tries and fails to win a football game single-handedly. I wanted him to die early on so the mature characters could get on with annoying the North Korean invaders but no, instead we are treated to Peck's character behaving like a spoil, selfish brat and risking his entire crew of fellow resistance fighters to save his ""she is my family"" blonde bimbo girlfriend.
We are them treated to scenes that demonstrate a young, wet behind the ears, completely inexperienced angry boy is somehow a more complete soldier than veteran marines and the cream of North Korean military.
Finally, we're supposed to believe that this eternally annoying POS somehow is the natural successor for the leadership of the Wolverines - yet doesn't have an ounce of originality to inject into his ""rousing"" speech at the end, which is a carbon copy of his elder brother's given near the beginning of the movie.

It kinda played out like a sequel to Team America, only not funny, I mean not even bad funny. The movie was poorly executed on many levels, if not every level. Characterization = crap, acting = crap, sequences = crap, composition = crap, cinematography = crap, costumes = crap, editing = crap, music = crap, plot = crap.Really though the biggest challenge was watching the preposterous set up, why on Earth would North Korea invade the US? For cheeseburgers, and capitalism? Would they honestly do it by parachuting in? Wouldn't the US military have just killed all those out of date, generic commie bastards with their superior technology, resources, and training? Really, would a handful of high school kids save the entire country from their small town middle America? The original was set during the height of the cold war, and people were genuinely afraid of the USSR, so at least it may have had a smidgen of value, who's afraid of North Korea? In fact I'm gonna do a Google search to find out...Google search complete - it seems only people who wear tinfoil hats are afraid of North Korea, go figure. The movie just goes way too far in expecting the audience to be able to suspend disbelief. Surly the only way to play out the above scenario is by using satire, and parody.I don't exactly know why this film offended me to the extent that I needed to share my disgust on IMDb. I watch crappy films all the time, and it doesn't normally bother me. Maybe it's because the whole idea of America ever being the underdogs in a war is just too conceited for me to handle. Especially against North Korea, and especially when they seem to be the dominant force in so many conflicts around the globe. I guess it's the whole schmaltzy, and smug agenda of celebrating the American spirit of freedom in a thoroughly fictional premise. Somebody needed to tell the people involved in the making of the film that it's actually kinda stupid, so just have fun with it.Don't get me wrong, I don't hate America, and I think that there are potentially many genuinely inspirational stories that can be told. Stories that embrace and promote American achievement, that truly celebrate their national identity, and the gifts they've given to the world. Unfortunately, If anything this movie debases any notion of that, and stains any sense of national pride the American people have built. Ultimately, It's shameless, pointless, twaddle.

If anything, I see less of a right wing propaganda, and more of a satirical jab at our foreign policy. Which is where my title comes in: with better directing and writing, more people might have seen what I saw, and this thing might not have a 5.6 rating. The way I saw it, this movie made me think about, ""What if the tables were turned? What if America got invaded, instead of the other way around?"" Now that my anti-political rant is over lets review the movie itself. Because that's what it is. A MOVIE. FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT. Acting: Passable. I'd give it a 7.5/10. Chris Hemsworth did well, though I won't be nominating him for any Oscars, but I think he did the best he could with very little character development. Peck also did well, but having grown up watching Drake and Josh, I just couldn't quite take him seriously at times. Hutcherson did as well as he could, but the writers couldn't decide what kind of character they wanted him to be. Darryl was probably the weakest of the main characters, but also was the most poorly written character. Neither of the girls had much of a personality (once again, thanks to the writing), so it's hard to judge, but Toni did well with a very emotional scene near the end, so she, at least, has potential. Writing/Directing: Ugh.... 4/10. They are the reason this movie wasn't good. Clichés everywhere (that could have easily been avoided, or at the least, downplayed), and several lines that tried for depth and drama, but fell flat. Such as Pete yelling, ""it means we're screwed!"" That line was easily the worst in the movie. Ya think, Pete? Cinematography/SFX: 6/10. Special effects were alright, but THE FREAKING SHAKY CAMERA!!! IT MAKES ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF AND THE CAMERA MAN AND THE DIRECTOR AND THE DICTATOR OF A SMALL EURASIAN COUNTRY ALL AT THE SAME TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!1!?!!!!',! What are you trying to accomplish? It doesn't bring me ""closer to the action."" All it does is give me a headache and make want to claw your eyeballs out with a fork. But, at least it wasn't as bad as some other movies (looking at you Hunger Games). Bottom line: 6/10 (Not an average). Maybe in 30 more years, well have someone remake the remake and add 20 minutes of character development, 10 minutes of filling in where the plot lacks (MAJOR SPOILER: how can they track Darryl after sending an EMP?) and downplay some of the clichés. Then, you would have a darn good movie, especially if they got rid of all political undertones, completely (But maybe thats just me).",Red Dawn
238,kitschyduck,More plot holes than a tennis racket,5,15 January 2014,"The only thing I found surprising in Red Dawn was that they killed off Chris Hemsworth, who I assumed to be the lead actor. That was probably a bad move just for the sake of trying to avoid cliché though. Josh Peck (who looks to me like a cross between Eastbound & Down's Steve Little and David Schwimmer than Chris Hemsworth's brother) arguably ruined the movie with his illegible mumbling and the plot had more holes than a tennis racket.I don't know why they bothered even saying anything about it being North Korea taking over. It could have been anyone really. Aliens probably would have been more entertaining. I gave this movie a '5' because I find that anything under a '6' on IMDb isn't really worth watching unless you have some kind of personal bias. I watched all of it mostly because I was curious how it would end, but I think I bordered on regretting wasting my time as nothing was really resolved anyway.",Red Dawn
239,chrissy_i,Not as good as the trailer makes it out to be....,3,24 April 2013,"This movie was one of the worst films I have seen. I can't begin to describe what was so terrible about it. Firstly there was no direction, build up or character development. I don't understand how a group of naive teenagers can successfully attack and take over a fully trained army base. The acting was average if not below. I know some of the scenes were suppose to be sad but i couldn't help but laugh at how terrible the acting was and I couldn't take it seriously. I thought the structure of the movie was all over the place; there was no real flow to it. It seemed like a complete rip off of the the movie ""tomorrow when the war began"". the ending was the worst part of the film! it was so rushed and just did not make sense! I honestly would not waste my time watching it.",Red Dawn
240,scottdelaney98,"Great Potential, Poor Execution",1,12 September 2013,"As a fan of the original I was really looking forward to this. What a wasted opportunity.A few random observations in no particular order:Killing is nasty business, not cause to dance with glee shouting ""wolverines!"" Don't misunderstand me, as means to show how one might become numb to killing this could be very effective. It just doesn't work if you're depicting all the killing from afar in a simplistic, comic book fashion. See the original where they execute the Russian soldier and the informer in their midst.Rebel insurgents generally do not wear make up, have their hair done, or wear fashionable, clean clothes that look like they were just bought at the Gap.When you jump through window glass and slide across the broken glass on the floor you bleed. A lot.Hiding in the woods and engaging in guerrilla warfare is dirty. Faces, hands, clothes, etc. Men (even 16, 17 and 18 year olds) grow beards. They do not appear clean shaven at all times and hair gel is not plentiful. Maintaining the Brad Pitt 3 day growth is also difficult.Also, contemplative evenings spent reminiscing and listening to Creedence are not part of the guerrilla rebel experience.",Red Dawn
241,Gods-gurlevr,Not worth the ridiculous ridiculing it has currently received. Good movie. (some spoilers),9,22 November 2012,"Let me just start by saying I only saw this movie because I have seen every single one of Josh Hutcherson's movies to date. This was going to be no exception to that. But I was reading through some of the other comments mentioned on this, although this movie is not the best I have seen this year it should be getting more credit then it has been receiving.True maybe the point of making the movie was to put guns in hot peoples hands, and add a love story into it then they would've called it ""Twilight with guns"". But it is more then that, there is a plot line to be found in it and there is a lot of action. Although I would agree with some others that this movie is not worth the money to see it theaters, at least wait tell it comes out to Redbox and rent it from there.",Red Dawn
242,kayelinabutterfly,Better Than the Original,7,22 November 2012,"I saw the original and I must say the remake has its benefits and I, honestly, think it's the better movie. I feel like the filming of the remake was better with the snow globe and I love how they incorporated the original with the remake instead of just stealing the name and going their own path. I felt like Josh Peck was an unusual pick but nonetheless I thought he did a fantastic job. Josh Hutcherson, I love him to death, but I felt like when he was crying or being upset, he either looked happy or it wasn't convincing enough. Again, love that boy to death but the dramatic acting wasn't the best. And I felt that the remake showed more character development than the original. I mean the original kicked into the plot and conflict really fast! The remake had its ""fluffy"" moments, with the chemistry between Jed and Toni's character. I thought the amount of comic relief was perfect! But over all, I think my favorite part was when they killed Jed. Just when you think everything is perfect, BAM! A bullet comes in and shoots Jed in the head! I just thought it was amazing that they had the guts to kill off the main character, which I loved! I can't explain how good it was because you'd think it'll be a good but cheesy action movie ending when they ride off into the sunset, but no, the younger brother, Matt(y) played by Josh Peck takes over; giving the same speech his brother did when he became the leader. I also loved that they weren't staying in the same ""safe haven"". Their camp was being constantly blown up and they had to keep moving. I love the clever and witty plans they came up to blow up the Koreans' tanks and stuff. I also thought the 80's montage when Jed was showing them how to fight like pros. Very eighties but I thought it was clever. Again, I don't think this movie was extraordinary, but I do think it was good and that people should go and see it. For being shelved for two years, it turned out to be a good movie. Although, the transitions after battle scenes were awkward because they cut a lot of it because of the China thing. But in other words, go see it!",Red Dawn

In fact some of the reviews I have seen admit to not even seeing the movie yet (really?) I am not one of those--just someone who likes movies, and I actually saw this one. In fact I paid for six tickets to take my family (all of us are adults) to this movie, and feel I got my money's worth.The basics--you will like this if: -you saw the first one and liked the ""concept"" -the trailer looked good to you--it delivers on the trailer -you don't mind a few changes in location, etc from the original -you like the action/suspense genre -if you don't mind a little cheering for the ""good guys"" -you are looking for some enjoyment or a little escape from reality -you don't think you are a critic You won't like this: -if you are, or think you are a movie critic -your biggest worry is camera angles or other movie speak -if you are looking for a movie to solve world hunger, etc.-if you have an agenda that has nothing to do with this movie -if you can't bear seeing communism ""vilified"" -if guns, bombs, or Marines scare you -you are expecting a documentary Go enjoy the movie!

This time I wanted to see the movie for the movie itself as I am only slightly familiar with this cast. I have to say that both had great casting but I very much enjoyed this movie over the original. I thought this one seemed better written, better casted and over all a better story line. I know some will say otherwise but this one seemed more like what could happen today than the original to me. I heard my dad ""tsk"" a few times and even I rolled my eyes over the original but this one I did not. The acting of some of the cast surprised me as I have not seen them before like Conner Cruise or Josh Peck whom to me is the kid ""from that Nick show"" my daughters watched. Isabel Lucas seemed to be a little 'off' and wished they'd given Brett Cullen a bit more time but I understand...

I don't know why he got the part(I'm actually assuming he has some sort of connection to someone financing movie) because the guy cannot act. Did they give him a screen test? The blank look on his face during scenes were just painful. Seriously, if you're putting that your time and money in a movie think about giving it the best chance possible of being a good movie and use actors who can actually act. That goes for Connor Cruise too, but in a lesser degree. I felt sorry for the other actors who had to work with them.

Details were well attended to. the whole concept of invasion was well thought out. Not just another Nuclear- attack bullshit. Probably the Americans didn't like to see what they are doing to countries like Iraq in the name of giving them better governance!!! This analogy is well drawn by Jed when he says, ""now, we're the bad guys"" and explains the situation. Also the film never tries to be too optimistic by making super humans out of some high-school kids. They are shown as rebels creating chaos. And the movie succeeds in showing that. And i haven't seen the original so i found the concept fresh. Its a good movie guys. DO WATCH IT!!!",Red Dawn

(may contain slight spoilers),9,21 November 2012,"Saw the new ""Red Dawn"" movie.... great flick.It's a shame the liberal press and media have slammed and put in reviews months ahead of its release to bring down ratings. Fortunately, their reviews are proved worthless as the theatre was completely packed with people to see it, and the fact that all current reviews prove the critics didn't actually see it... ***POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW**** ** ** *It was actually Russia and North Korea who design a EMP that fries the *entire north American electrical grid and electronic devices, and both *invade the USA (as both are present in the movie). Most of the reviews *make fun of the movie on the premise of North Korea only, proving that *had they watched it, they would have realized Russia was also involved *and part of the invasion. ** ** ****END SPOILER*******Originally, the movie was filmed and all North Korean references were China. It was to be China and Russia who invaded. After China complained to the weakling and fearful politicians we have here, who then cried all sorts of injunctions on the if they did not change them (and MGM was financially hurting at the time and couldn't take the risk. So all of the Chinese references, intro, etc were edited to North Korean forces, hence the release delay. You can't tell they were edited, and it still fits seamlessly.It remains faithful to the original, only on a much larger scale, and much more action packed.For the ""WOLVERINES"", I give this a 9/10 based on the fact I wish it was rated R to get some more gore in there (there was slight gore, but love seeing guts fly personally), it was a little slow to start, and I wish there was a bit more emphasis on the civilian massacre and concentration camps.",Red Dawn
256,jacobsgladedage,Not bad at all.,8,23 February 2013,"If you love movies where a small bunch of true 'muricans struggle to fight against a vastly superior, and completely hateable, force you're going to enjoy this movie to it's fullest.It's frankly a well produced B action movie with everything it needs in this day and age. Instead of cheesy one-liners delivered by Arnold you get a huge bunch of patriotism and freedom loving. The story is still silly, probably more so than it was 28 years ago. But it's good enough to set the premise of being under siege.The acting isn't stellar but it isn't terrible either and the casting works well enough to let you stereotype people. Which is important because the script doesn't really do much in the line of character development. It goes along the nice black and white lines of ""HE STRONK"" and ""HE EVIL"", and it's honestly alright in this type of movie.The action and the guerrilla warfare really shine though, it's always adrenaline pumping and like the original the fighting isn't all fun and games.I loved the original and here 28 years later I'm loving this remake.Of course it's not the kind of movie you're going to look cool appreciating openly.

257,mrsjennifermcfly,Where are the strong female characters?,2,7 June 2013,"I should say that the original version is one of my favorite movies of all time, I've seen it at least 10 times. This version had so much bad- trying to pass off Michigan as the PNW (it's like you didn't even try. It's green here, with big mountains. Also, Spokane is kinda far from Seattle. And in a mountain. It's not the same), there were no allies, the best scene of the original (where the invaders are para-shooting down at the school) wasn't recreated, the ""enemy"" and the movie in general took itself WAY too seriously and lost the campy vibe of the original, and the females in this version were just dumb lifeless model-types that relied on their vacant muscle bfs to save them. In the original there was so much more character building and arcs with the girls- they were terrified, assaulted by the enemy, started out scared and quiet, then (realistically) turned out to be the most bad ass, cunning girls with guns and homemade bombs ever. That was one of the best parts of the movie- watching these kids grow up, having to deal with this big catastrophic event while still being teenagers who just wanted to go home. This movie focused way too much on the ""video game"" aesthetics with big CGI and special effects and completely missed the heart of the story. Such a let down!!! Let's hope they don't actually get it together for the remake of The Goonies, because that will be even more heartbreaking. Let's come up with new ideas, Hollywood, and leave the classics alone.",Red Dawn
258,krispy8,Decent - once you overlook some things,7,5 March 2013,"I'm not sure why everyone is so hard on this film.. maybe because they were comparing it to the original Red Dawn? Or maybe they were expecting too much? I skimmed through some of the other reviews which all seemed to base their low rating 3 ideas. 1. that it's unlikely North Korea can occupy the US; 2. why they would choose to invade a small town; 3. and why a band of teenagers would make a difference. Those reasons are irrelevant. If you think of every movie like that, there are lots of things that aren't realistic but that doesn't mean the movie can't be entertaining. For example, it's unrealistic that Bane can hijack a military plane, blow it up, and then jump out of it safely onto another plane, all in mid-flight thousands of ft above ground. 1. In the movie, they briefly mentioned that the N. Koreans had some kind of new EMP that knocked out the US' communications and equipment. Sure.. that's a far fetch but that's not the point of the movie. The US can attack and occupy other countries, so why can't N. Korea (with Russian assistance)? (N. Korea has one of the largest military in the world) 2. What city they invaded is not the point either.. they could have made it about Manhattan if that makes you happier. They mentioned that the N. Koreans invaded many parts of the country so this is just one of the places they occupied. Perhaps, this small town, USA was a geographical location that gave them some kind of vantage point for a region of the country? 3. Why can't a band of rebels (even teenagers) make a difference? It's not that unbelievable that teenagers can shoot. It's also not that unbelievable that they can organize themselves into an effective force under the right leadership (like a marine). They're not trying to say that the group will save the entire country or kill all the invaders in the town. As Chris Hemsworth stated near the beginning of the movie, it's moreso that a small group can make a nuisance for the invaders and defeat their spirit. Look at the movie Defiance, which is based on a true story. There are also elements of rebellion in other more famous movies like Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Braveheart, etc. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie actually, despite what others say. I think many people were probably expecting something else and had high hopes and felt disappointed, but if you watch this movie without reading any reviews first or criticism, you may be entertained!",Red Dawn

The opening scene in this case is of a very feminine boy being picked up from a loosing school football game by his apparently VERY wealthy girlfriend in a sparkling new Mustang. Easily legit in any upper class suburb.

I understand the North Koreans would have a tough time invading the U.S. it was originally written as China but had to change it. This Red Dawn was way more believable in the sense that a group of kids could be trained by a Marine to fight guerrilla warfare instead of an average Jed (Patrick Swayze). I also liked how they differed from the original and didn't follow it to a T. One thing i did not appreciate was how Jed died instantly. Should of went out with a bang. This movie was only one hour and thirty minutes. I would of liked it to be longer to develop characters and their relationships, maybe explain more about the takeover etc. The action was well done. Actors also good. Very entertaining movie. I would hope for a sequel. This movie was screwed from all these haters who complain about everything instead of enjoying a good movie.

Hemsworth is the only one that was passable, the rest disgustingly atrocious. Josh Peck is an absolute joke, It was painful to watch him, he should never have been casted. Even after filming somebody should have done something to midigate his performance. I can't speak enough to how terrible he was. The rest of the supporting cast not much better. Seems like all they could do was make dramatic faces and awkwardly spew out their lines.This whole movie was terrible, i feel bad for anyone who is associated with this garbage, for the original movie and cast, because the new generation will likely judge their work on this ridiculous performance.I really hope that the next time somebody decides to re-make a movie, they put some real effort into it.",Red Dawn

Fortunately I came to read reviews of this film AFTER I watched it, otherwise I probably would have been scared away by all these hating 'critics'. The story is, as most say, ridiculous. But I don't understand why everyone sees that as such a big deal. The chances are slim for the North Koreans to invade the United States, just as the chances are slim for there to be people flying spaceships and fighting with lightsabers or people fending off alien invasions alongside giant robots that transform into cars. It's a movie, why does everything have to make perfect sense?Apart from the story the film was overall satisfying. During the movie there was not once when I felt bored and wanted to go do something else. The action scenes were intense, and there were just enough casualties on the good side to stop me from seeing this as an ""in-the- end-good-guys-win-and-everythings-alright"" film.Lastly, this is my first review and I know I sound really unprofessional.

270,fightzone58,i thought it was a decent movie (spoiler),7,20 March 2013,"it gets a bit unrealistic in a few places, but every movie with a rifle in it does. the most unrealistic part is the way they hold guns. actors always lean their head forward to aim. the recoil would put the sight in your eye socket. they don't hold the guns tight against their shoulders either. an ak-47 has a recoil that will snap your collar bone. if you wanna see a realistic gun fight, you should join a military at war. iv never seen a realistic gunfight in any movie. grenades always explode with a flash fire and a shockwave in movies. in reality you don't see much. most negative reviews focus on the location, age of kids, and the enemies abilities. if your trying to take control of a country, you start on the outside and work your way inward. north Korea is currently one of the strongest enemies America has. anyone that lives in a city should be able to understand that kids with guns are extremely dangerous. kids don't usually understand the consequences of killing people, which makes it easier for them to pull the trigger. if u wanna make an excuse to hate it before you watch it, you should save your time. nitpicking at things u don't understand will just waste more of your time than the movie did. my biggest complaint is the fact that approximately 10 people fight back throughout the whole movie. its America, we have more guns than people and most of them are held to fight back against this exact situation. a nice fact to remember is that the American constitution gives civilians the right to bear arms so they can protect themselves against foreign enemies that overpower American forces. a lot more people would fight",Red Dawn

Amazingly the 1984 version of this film was actually grittier and what one might imagine as true to life. The writers did attempt to incorporate some of the iconic scenes from the original.

277,annilator86,A Great Film Panned By Spoiled Critics,10,27 January 2014,"Red Dawn 2012 is a very underrated action film that actually does better than the original Red Dawn. Reviewers and critics alike panned the film for its plot. However, the film resembles the recent 2011 video game ""Homefront"". The game was not panned for its setting and time line, which the film follows similarly. This does not make much sense, since both are related in writing material and plot in one or more ways.The film is a blast and is very entertaining. The plot makes more sense than the original Red Dawn and you have to watch further to get the whole clear picture. Film critics and moviegoers alike are spoiled from some modern films, since most films hand the viewer the plot on a silver plate the first few minutes or half hour of the film. The film's action is brutal and very entertaining and the thought of a North Korean occupation scares me, since North Korea doesn't take too kindly to Americans or Westerners in general.The acting is great and kudos to Josh Peck for giving his best film performance yet. Though the rest of the cast did a great job, Josh Peck deserves some special attention, since Red Dawn is basically his first huge big-budget action/war film. Well done to you Josh and I wish Drake was in there as well so that you can through one of your famous lines in there! XD Overall, the film is great. Great action, along with a sensible plot that everyone seems to ignore and good acting performances, especially to Josh Peck, make Red Dawn one of the most under-rated action films in recent memory. Red Dawn enters the list of The Most Under-Rated Action Films of the 2000s and 2010s, joining ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" and ""Battleship"" in my personal list.",Red Dawn

280,ghostmachine000,Pour bleach in my eyes!!!!,4,10 April 2014,"This movie was canned, processed, prepackaged, Hollywood crap. Always nice to see high school students in the 20 yr old to 30 yr old range. Script was choppy, continuity was bad. A shame they call it a remake of the original. They could have or should have called it ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" OH THAT""S right the Aussie's made that one already. To make matters worse they kept to the same plot which in this day and age is just stupid, ludicrous and ignorant. The idea that an invading army could penetrate into America that far with no one noticing or taking action is absurd. Maybe this was plausible back in 1984 but today, no way. Call it anything else but 'Red Dawn' and EH you get a so-so movie that kills 93 minutes. Maybe I set my expectations to high. Either way the original is a 110% better than this puke, vomit throw up and out waste of time remake. These people went to school to learn how to make films. I guess it looked better on paper and that's where it should have stayed....at least until they got a bigger budget and a production staff and director who knows how to make films. The only saving grace was the half assed acting....which would have been better if the script wasn't such a Hindenburg....OH THE HUNANITY!!!!!! DON'T WATSE YOUR TIME!!!!

283,williambonadurer,How do they not die right away,3,12 December 2014,"The 1984 Red Dawn is a classic movie that I am surprised more people haven't seen. It stars Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swazye before they became famous. The movie is really popular among gun enthusiasts and people who like cheesy action movies. I love this movie and I was very excited when they came out with a new version in 2012. These high expectations and the mediocrity of the movie combined to provide me with a huge letdown. The new one is predictable, full of mistakes, and is poorly made. Some scenes in this movie are similar to parts in John Milius' version, with one scene being the exact same. The things that were added to this movie, like romance, just led to cliché romantic scenes. Though the action scenes were bearable, the movie still left me bored at some points.Set in Spokane, Washington, this movie pits a group of teens led by an Iraq War veteran against the invading North Korean Army. The group of teens calls themselves the ""Wolverines,"" and they use hit and run techniques modeled after those used by the Taliban in Iraq to harass the occupying army. They use car bombs to create chaos and help to liberate their town. As the movie progresses they turn from clueless teens into soldiers.The movie tries to hit the same chord with America that the original did. A lot has changed in the last 30 years, most notably our number one fear is no longer a war with communists. The producers first picked China as the invading force, but decided that this would hurt sales in the world's second biggest movie market. This movie is also very unrealistic. It first has the North Koreans pulling a sneak attack on the U.S. homeland. There are many satellites used by the U.S. and its allies and none of those satellites saw an attacking force sailing across the pacific. It is also unrealistic how the group of teens are vastly out-gunned and out matched, yet they keep winning.The best part of this movie, by far, was the action scenes. These were filled with many different, high budget, realistic explosions. That being said, the action scenes were still pretty bad. They were confusing and it was unrealistic how the group never got caught. Somehow they could sneak into an area and plant a bomb without anyone noticing. All these teenagers also know how to make bombs. Making bombs is pretty complicated and all of them pick it up like its riding a bike that could kill them. These action scenes also show the Wolverines atop buildings shooting down on the Koreans. How they get to these buildings without being noticed and then get away after is beyond me. There is also the question of how they continue to find C4, a bomb making material. They first find a small stick of it on a dead soldier, but the movie never shows them getting more. Over the course of the movie, however, they have enough to make a dozen bombs.The acting in this movie was also terrible. They chose two big name action stars, Josh Hutchinson and Chris Hemsworth. These two do a god job at their roles, but other performances felt forced, and the actors were bad at showing emotions, most notably Josh Peck. This movie showed that he is not an action star and he is not a good dramatic actor. His character is supposed to be someone who is always angry and lets that fuel why he is fighting. He can neither act sad nor angry. When he has to do so he just resorts to yelling which sounds forced and out of place.I don't know why Hollywood keeps remaking classic movies. These movies either end up being a huge disappointment or a movie that is too much like the initial version to enjoy. This movie ended up being both. I think they should just leave old movies alone. I have never seen a remake that I have enjoyed more than the original. Classic movies are either remembered as a great movie or they are remade and become a high budget flop.",Red Dawn

Chris Hemsworth, the only actor worth his salt in the entire movie, is clearly out of his element, and appears to be desperately trying to right a sinking ship for the duration of the entire film. The time line of the movie makes no sense either. At one point they were in their hideout in the woods discussing the things they missed, as if they had been in hiding for months, when it was more like days. The 3 Marines they encounter are as one dimensional as they could make them, spouting corny 1-liners through southern drawls.Takes itself way to seriously.",Red Dawn
285,r_noton,How is Josh Peck still an actor?,4,18 June 2015,"Now, as far as movies go, I have seen much worse. The overall plot of the movie, while very flawed, had it's points that impressed me. AS a fan of the earlier movie from 1984, I had been hoping that this movie would be the modern telling of a bunch of high school kids defending their home. The movie succeeded in being exactly what I had hoped. That being said..... This movie completely lacked any fragment of reality, like the earlier 1984 movie had done. In today's day and age it makes absolutely zero sense that high school kids, with very minimal training, are transformed from bumbling kids into full fledged pseudo-Marines capable of killing fully trained North Korean soldiers. Now whatever it's a movie and things in movies don't always make sense but to me it kinda got outta hand.When I watch a movie, I put a lot of importance in the actors performances and how invested in I am in their character. In my opinion, the worst part of the entire movie was the acting. Not all of the performances were flawed however. Josh Hutcherson (Robert) did a fantastic job of being a scared little boy turned badass and was extremely believable. Chris Hemsworth (Jed) in all of his ""Thor"" glory, was quite believable as well. He is a Marine and Marines fight in war and are more used to it than others, so naturally the Marine would be the leader. A few other characters were not overly believable, but Josh Peck (Matt) was by far the worst. His character is so 1-dimensional and Josh does not bring anything to the dialogue. He looks completely out of it for half of the movie and the other half he's either screaming, or is way too close in people's personal space at the worst of times. I couldn't believe they actually let that guy on screen. I most likely would have given this movie a 6 had he not been in it. Chris is almost able to cancel him out, but it didn't work. I dreaded every time Matt was on the screen. And to be honest, the rest of the cast's dislike for his performances came out on screen. It looked to me like Chris wanted to get through scenes with him as quickly as humanly possible, Isabel Lucas (Erica) seemed to shy away from him in any kind of intimate moment and everyone else seemed to nearly be scowling at him in disgust when he would deliver his lines.Overall wasn't the worst movie in the world, but definitely was not the best by any means.

Or maybe they are North Korean trolls ;-) Seriously, I think it goes beyond having bad taste by those poor reviews and being back-to-front in their reviewing, as there seems to be an obvious agenda at play to attack the pro-freedom pro-Americana themes in this film which a lot of people nowadays are stating to hate on, and that is the only logical reason I think there have been so many negative reviews. If you believe the absurd consensus you would think this film is a real stinker, but to my delightful surprise it was very entertaining and positive on so many fronts! Action, romance, adventure, and a believable story, this film is well worth checking out, and isn't cliche, predictable or nauseatingly left leaningFirst of all the acting: It was good, had a bunch of next door type young kids who were good support for Hemsworth in the lead role, which was believable and enjoyable to watch. While the 2nd main lead "" Matty "" wasn't my ideal pick for the role , but I think he came through in the end. There are attractive female characters that have a strong supporting role and did well in their role.There was a fair bit of action that was balanced in well with the overall story-line, of a bunch of kids and an older ex-marine that go out in the woods after an invasion by a foreign force. The story then develops in a logical, easy to understand manner which builds tension. There are many good moments where you feel good for the team, and has a range of emotions covered from joyous victory to sacrifice, loss of loved ones, fatigue and terror.

The author of the 1984 Red Dawn wasn't writing about Russia and Cuba invading the United States. His vision was that our own government would turn on the country.

(Lots of action movies have the same, mindlessly fascist tone.) It's that the film operates under a belief that America is a good and just nation that has never done anything wrong and must always be on the watch for evil countries trying to take down our freedom. Look, I may not be interested in a documentary like 2016: Obama's America, but I can at least understand how a film like that plays into one view of what's going on in the country. But this new Red Dawn is utterly, scarily devoid of a basic understanding of current events. The movie plays up the fact that Jed is a Marine who did a tour of Iraq, which makes him an ideal leader for this ragtag bunch of pretty, vacant people squaring off against scowling North Koreans. But the way that the movie tells it, Jed was in Iraq to do, uh, heroic, awesome things. There's not even one moment in which Red Dawn troubles itself with the notion that perhaps the way Jed and his buds feel about these invading North Koreans is precisely the way the Iraqis felt about him coming to their country. At a time when everything from War of the Worlds to Battlestar Galactica has subversively retold the Iraq story by making the heroes the insurgents, Red Dawn just plows forward, confident in its belief that as long as America is in trouble, we can do whatever the hell we want.",Red Dawn

The main characters go on a eh okay chase seen with the North Koreans. More teenage drama. The first guerrilla based action scene doesn't make sense at all from any point of view except for them killing a few North Koreans. They start doing small scouting and bombing of areas. More teenage drama.They attempt to bomb a communist rally which is thwarted by the North Korean commanding officer in which they find out that the Russians are involved (50/50 on making sense), An actor gets get killed because of teenage drama. Oh wait there's more teenage drama. Their first hideout gets attack leaving an actor and actress dead in which the group bumps into a small group of Marines that are searching for a radio. At this point they find out that the East and West coast were hit by EMP or an Electro-Magnetic Pulse shutting everything but cars, TV's, Radios, and cell phones operations (wasn't well thought for the entire movie if you know what EMP can actually do). They find out that the special radio is being held by the enemy main character at the police station that is being barely guarded at all. One of the soldiers dies and one of the wolverines gets tagged with an GPS device.More teenage drama.The North Koreans and Russians do a surprise attack on the second hideout killing Thor or the good actor in the group. They find out as they are driving away on a random road that the guy was tagged and leave him with a gun to fight off what ever may come to him. They get to a rendezvous point with a helicopter for the Marines in which a very badly written speech is spoken to the soldiers by one of the bad main actors. The character stated he shall stay with his friends and fight it out.Ending of movie was another bad speech to what looked like a bunch of homeless people that they literally got off the street and were told by the director to watch the guy speaking.

The 30 year old teenagers in this movie throw out mercilessly sub par dialog like ""This is not their land. This is our back yard and we're going to fight for it,"" or ""they killed our father, we have to fight or die."" I'm sure that's what they said in Fallujah too when good ol' George W. sent his invading army to destroy their country. Aaameeerica, Aaameeerrrrriiiicaa!! God save them all, they do make me laugh and cry at the same time.Enough has already been said in previous reviews about the wildly idiotic plot and lazy directing. Rather get the 1984 version. At least it had some heart in it, though the plot was just as ludicrous, playing on the strange fear of communism America has always fostered. One more thing! Modern movies (this one being no exception) way overuse the lazy technique of compressing together various sorts of character growth sequences into a few minutes. It's very annoying and shows a lack of skill on everyones part.",Red Dawn
302,anthonywwood,Would rather had spent the time sleeping,3,24 March 2013,"Don't waste your time watching it!!! If you liked the first one this one sucks so bad Bill Clinton would have told it to go away.Has a few good one liners but other than that waste of time. The acting was horrible. Nothing like trying to throw a damn love story in the movie. I wonder how planes flying over would shake a house hmm only low flying ones would do that, and the ones dropping troops are at least 1000 ft. Now in one seen they show a F-16 flying low and fast that would wake the dead. Ending blows.Another thing military equipment is hardened from E.M.P. All yeah and they killed Thor",Red Dawn
303,rdobman,Different from the original but still very good,9,9 December 2012,"This movie, as you know by now is based off a 1984 film of the same name. Chris hemsworth plays Jed Eckert, a veteran of the war in Iraq who is now home from combat. After being invaded by North Koreans he trains a group of teens including his younger brother Matt (who is played by Josh Peck) to fight back for their home. Reading the reviews from every body else it seems like they haven't seen the original because the ""flaws"" they point out are apart of the first movie. In the first it was a group of teens who fought against Russians. Another thing was that there was an even shorter IntroductIon to the characters In the original. It was just Jed dropping his brother and his brother's friend off at school, a short remark about how Matt had lost the game the night before and about a minute of a teacher teaching a class before the Russians are dropped In. Also they lived in an even smaller town than the one in this one which is another concern of these reviewers (because if someone invaded the U.S of course they would take over every city except for small towns *obvious sarcasm). The one thing I was mad about when I saw the previews was that it wasn't as small as the town in the original. That's one of the reasons why the original was so great. In my mind the citizens of a small town are even more likely to be a threat because they can actually do stuff and they know how to survive a lot better than the people in the cities can. I should know because I grew up In a small town and I live in the city now. I have a hard time finding out the reasons why people think this movie is so unbelievable. I mean yeah the EMP would take out all electronics and yeah it is a long shot to think a group of kids could do all that but does that mean it can't happen? I mean in Africa there used to be villages that were taken over by child soldiers. Also for the one person who said it doesn't seem possible that the North Koreans could do that in one night, I believe he has forgotten all about how we got into WWII with Pearl Harbor. Bottom line is it's Hollywood every movie has something unbelievable in it and it doesn't go to the point were it is unbearable to watch because of how unbelievable it is.",Red Dawn
304,Adiemusproject,Utter garbage,4,22 February 2013,"I had high expectations from this movie as MGM are rarely known for jumping into rubbish concepts...and, O.K. I've heard the arguments about it not being as silly as men shooting webs from his hands etc etc, but those movies you go into KNOWING thats what you're getting. I hoped for a more realistic effort here....and was very disappointed. The acting is diabolical. In fact, they'd have got a better performance if they HAD taken an actual high school football team and told them to learn the script. My personal experience also suffered from a soundtrack that had to be constantly altered as it went from very low dialogue, to deafening ""action"" scenes. This is such an old, jaded premise, save your time, sanity and money (if you've been daft enough to pay hard earned dough for this!)and choose something else.",Red Dawn
305,grilldoggy,"If you liked the original, then...",4,27 May 2013,"You will be disappointed at the wasted potential here. The original Red Dawn is a classic that many are fine with. Russians invade US soil, and a military response from red-blooded Americans that would make any veteran proud is the outcome. The latest Red Dawn begins with an updated intro that hints at a great movie to come. The biggest problem is simply the ending, which is lazy and incomplete. I don't know if this is a lack of imagination, or a dislike of filmed endings that ended up on a cutting room floor. Worth a glance, but don't get your hopes up. I've seen more ambition in TV movies, which is pathetic and inexcusable.",Red Dawn
306,munday-bradley,"a great movie, and well worth your time and money",9,30 November 2012,"this movie is absolutely amazing! words cannot describe the wonderful acting provided by the cast members in this movie. the raw emotion and heart pumping action is enough to declare this movie one of the best of 2012. sure, at first (if you've seen drake and josh), you'll only see Matt (played by Josh Peck) as just another child star trying to climb his way up the Hollywood popularity ladder and failing, but you'll actually see he has grown and matured well out of just the comedy genre. his emotion and passion into acting (along with scenes with his movie brother, Chris Hemsworth) is enough proof that Josh Peck is worthy of future movies; comedy, action, or drama. acting included by the other main characters, Chris Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, etc., is also outstanding. everyones effort pitched in proved to be more than enough. this movie is AMAZING.",Red Dawn
307,joshuahjames,The ONLY Review You Need Read,7,11 March 2013,"If you enjoy going to action movies for the thrill of the explosions and the conflict between testosterone-soaked, diametrically-opposed characters, watch this movie. I did, and it was a blast!If, on the other hand, you are looking for a deep, honest, dark, poignant, eye-opening journey into the human condition which is also deep, honest, dark, poignant and eye-opening, watch...I don't know, Capote, or Koyaanisqatsi, or some such self-absorbed, self-righteous, smug bullshit.What most(and I mean Critic and User) reviewers failed, so miserably, to see, is that Red Dawn never bothered to go about impressing them. The writers and director don't care what The Village Voice has to say about a fun, patriotic roller-coaster movie. It is not a ""film"" about which you wax eloquent at a wine and cheese party. This movie is for pure entertainment. It IS entertaining. It IS exciting. And yes, the premise of North Korea taking over the Pacific Northwest IS absolutely stupid. Get over it. Had the writers, producers, director, been interested in impressing the likes of Peter Travers at Rolling Stoned, they would have included some tastefully ""artistic"" scene of some underage actor masturbating, or maybe a Catholic priest molesting a kid. Those always get you an Oscar nod :)To break it down simply; if you enjoy movies for their excitement and entertainment value, you will enjoy this. If you get your ""News"" from Jon Stewart, you will not.",Red Dawn
308,gorbyak,Wow,1,18 December 2012,"Really bad. I found myself never caring for anyone or anything in this poor excuse of a film. Do not watch it. I really cannot believe this didn't go straight to video. I assume that part of the problem, is that we don't realistically think North Korea will invade the U.S. In the 1980's it was much more believable that the U.S.S.R would invade. I assume the producers thought Chris Hemsworth was going to be able to carry this through. It appears that it might have, currently at 40 million at the box office. Josh Peck should have stayed fat and on Nickelodeon if this is what his going to put forth in terms of acting. I also read that it sat on a shelf for awhile and had to be re-edited to make the invading army North Korean instead of Chinese. Usually when I see movies like this, I can at least laugh. I was unable to at all. Save your money and watch the original on TBS next weekend, or every weekend for the next twenty years.",Red Dawn
309,alexkfridges,Absolutely horrible. Not a single frame worth seeing.,1,10 December 2012,"This movie was the worst movie i have seen in years. I went in to the cinema not expecting anything but a fun action movie, not expecting great dialogue or any of that business. I was however met with a complete pile of garbage, barely recognizable as any sort of 'film'. all the premises are completely ridiculous and unbelievable, and performed in such a stupid way that it pulls the audience completely out of the drama/engagement. (you'll see what i mean in the opening 10 minutes). Instead of going ""OH MY GOD WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?"" you will just be face palming and squirming in your seat.The only saving grace this movie has left, then, is the action, right? Well, it was disgustingly bad. The director takes shaky-cam to the next level, with such tight shots and ridiculous layouts the audience will see nothing but motion blur, muzzle flashes in the camera's face and occasionally a huge explosion. You will have no idea where anyone is in relation to each other, and simply be watching a fuzzy mess of flashing visuals accompanied by overly loud wails and gunshots. Absolutely ridiculous, i didn't know action could be this boring. You will be about as emotionally attached to the characters as you would a piece of damp cardboard floating in a clogged sink.Out of everything, though, the thing that makes me hate this movie so much is the fact that it thinks it is hugely emotionally engaging and dramatic, with constant inspirational speeches being made (by characters who have probably had about 2 minutes of screen time). The film just takes itself so seriously even though it utterly fails on every level on which it is possible to fail, and even in some which are impossible. I could forgive it if the film were simply trying to be a silly action ride, like The Expendables for example, rather than trying to appeal to the 'American spirit' etc etc. Do not see this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Do not support the industry that churns out this garbage, and save a few brain cells whilst doing so. I give it zero out of ten.",Red Dawn
310,rball4042,Amazing,10,24 December 2012,"This movie was amazing. The action was great, the effects realistic, and the actors great as well. The story was also very realistic. The possibility of a Russo-Chino-Korean alliance in the real world is definitely there. I will say, however, that the previews were a little misleading concerning the huge invasion of America. I think the creators should have worked the massive Russian threat into the trailer to make the concept make more sense, as a North Korean invasion with the firepower to lock down all of America is pretty far-fetched. The distribution of power is realistic as well. I think the movie was left open-ended, as the Wolverines gained tremendous strength in numbers by the end but we don't know what has happened to the rest of the nation. I'll definitely be looking forward to a sequel if and when it happens.",Red Dawn
311,reallycoolman2003-207-478311,"Ridiculous, totally",4,14 April 2013,"This movie starts off well enough, and the way that the North Koreans are introduced is easily the most epic thing ever (thud, thud, rattle, thud).The big problem here, is how easily the people capitulate. Frankly, army or not, there's no way that North Korea would invade America due to the fact that two thirds of the people own firearms. Thats the whole point of the second amendment, instead of a standing army, the people are the army.The film fails on this point alone. It also shows how important the second amendment is (so in that sense I praise it). Imagine being in Washington and seeing enemy soldiers parachuting in, you would grab your gun, anyone would. yet these folks stand there terrified, and capitulate in seconds. This is what would happen in an unarmed nation, like my country. But in America, the sleeping giant would (hopefully) awake.Frankly I see this as a social satire, and a timely one. It maybe unintelligent, but the case in the first 15 minutes, is made for an armed public, who would easily massacre an invading army.",Red Dawn

The plot holes, awful acting, horrible scenes, the list just goes on. N. Korea army invasion U.S. with only thousands soldiers? That's just laughable, and a humiliation to the intelligence.Save your bucks and time, go to next movie.I can not believe there is any investment went to in to this movie making, esp. considering this is from Hollywood, where you would expect high quality movies.

And: Dear BIG America, has anyone asked Korea or any other countries about your help? Not every nation want your intervention.And: Chris Hemsworht, why did you do this?

314,Rockson,Entertaining and possibly Prophetic,8,7 April 2013,"I watched the Original and New version, both very entertaining, but in light of current tensions with North Korea, this movie could make anyone experience or Re-live the old fears of the cold war.This movie has an excellent cast and most of them deliver a good performance, Hutcherson and Hemsworth did an excellent job, however the character played by Josh Peck needed someone else to play him.This only time this movie can have relevance and impact, with Lil'Kim Jong Un flexing his red muscle, and the possibility of war with North Korea becoming highly likely, this movie can be both entertaining and prophetic. A must see for preppers everywhere.",Red Dawn
315,FatedScythe777,It's better then you think it would be...,5,7 December 2012,"Normally... Normally I'm not one who enjoys remakes. But Red Dawn is honestly one of the better remakes in recent years. It's not you typical ""copy & paste"" remake like every other remake in the last half a decade. It takes certain aspects of the original and keeps them. While taking others that you're waiting for and completely turns them upside down.The opening ""news"" segment is kinda pointless. I feel that the movie could have done better without it.As far as performances... Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck have good chemistry. What seems awkward at first then progress into Brothers coming together actually feels real. Still, you can easily tell that the film was one of Hemsworth's rookie performances. He's still a little rough around the edges in this film. A note, for those that don't know Red Dawn was filmed before Hemsworth starred as Thor in Thor and The Avengers. It sat in Limbo during MGM's near bankruptcy. Now personally my favorite roles in this version were that of Robert and Daryl played by Josh Hutcherson and Connor Cruise (who I didn't know was Tom Cruise's adopted son). They have great on screen chemistry. For what time he is on screen, Jeffery Dean Morgan is great as always. Will Lee Yun and Isabel Lucas's are by far the worst. Personally I've never thought Lucas had talent, certainly not in Transformers 2. And Yun's character was kinda wasted.That said, is the remake better then the original... Yes and no. It's a little fast paced. If the filmmaker had slowed the plot it could have been better. But it is enjoyable. So when you're reading these reviews. Don't think to hard about what people say. It's they're opinion. Make up your own mind to see the movie. It's not a serious movie. It's a ""relax and enjoy your weekend"" kind of movie. Also, it has a sweet trailer for World War Z with Brad Pitt based on Max Brooks's novel attached to it. That movie looks good.",Red Dawn
316,r-wood-382-688830,Josh Peck is awful,1,20 February 2013,"This movie, as you know by now is based off a 1984 film of the same name, and thats where it ends, OK the storyline is the same but we've gone from a small town in the first film to a city in this one and that alone makes it fail!! The worst part about the movie has to be the cast though,i was looking forward to see Chris Hemsworth as so far i have been pretty impressed by the lad and to be fair he did a average job, as for the rest of the cast tho the casting agents want sacking!!!! Josh Peck is by far the worst actor i have ever seen and tbh his performances in Drake and Josh where by far more convincing than I've seen him in films recently, the guy is just awful and i will avoid any film in the future that stars him or in fact even has him as a extra, I cannot stress how awful this guy is, too sum him up hes living on the fact he lost loads of weight and thats it end of!!! So all i can advise people is if your having trouble sleeping this film may help if not avoid at all costs!!",Red Dawn
317,mikejrulez,"Mediocre, But Not Bad",6,3 February 2013,"I went to see this movie with high hopes. Honestly, I only decided to watch it because one, the three male leads are quite attractive, and two, it looked like a movie with lots of fight scenes. If you go by that alone, the movie exceeded my hopes of attractive characters and lots of fighting. But the storyline was very jagged. First, what kind of teenager is able to kill someone? Yes, I understand that they're on adrenaline, and without killing, they'll die. But even so, I wouldn't be able to kill someone without feeling incredibly sick afterwards. Second, the shaky camera didn't add any desperation, it just made me feel like they hired a ten year old to film the movie. Third, it was incredibly unrealistic. Teenagers able to shoot fully grown men. An army invading a tiny town. And that army can't even shoot a teenager with 0 experience. And they can't guard a group of teenagers. Or a giant building. And then the army of the invaded nation sends in THREE soldiers to take orders from said teens. It was very unrealistic. Some parts made me laugh just because of references from other movies (like when Robert took the bread from Subway, it reminded me of Peeta) and some parts really shocked me, but all in all, the movie was money fairly well spent, and I would watch the movie again, but just for mindless fun.",Red Dawn
318,motorcrossboyz,"Copied another film, predictable and almost boring",4,1 January 2013,"lets start off by saying that as soon as i heard of this film last year i instantly thought of ""Tomorrow when the War Began."" ""Red Dawn"" has an almost directly similar storyline to this film and unbelievable set in similar circumstances. It is almost like they completely copied from Tomorrow when the war began, and stuck it in an American environment to stir up the American patriots. Unbelievable.honestly i guessed 7 things at the start of this film and 6 of them came true. From amazing feats of courage like speaking out against the invaders, to cheesy quotes from the marines, i literally would have bet my life on sum of the things that i thought would happen in a ""save the country"" type of film...It was good with the action and shooting coming together to make a nice 'war' film and make it entertaining, but it lacked emotional interest and i found myself asking whether or not i cared about some their group being killed. It was as if the director tried to put it in there so that people would renew their interest. It didn't really cut it.I honestly didn't find the 'overall' picture to be too bad with lots of gun fights and guerrilla warfare, because thats just my personal preference, but with boring, predictable scenes around every corner, i almost zoned out and fell to sleep. 4/10, only because i like fighting sorts of films",Red Dawn
319,sandyford-sinner,Oh Dear...,3,26 February 2013,"There have been enough people talking and reviewing this movie, displaying all it's faults so I'm still on my bandwagon about REAL people portraying the characters.The parts of teenagers in this movie is once again taken over by alien clones who haven't been teenagers for ten years or more. Only aliens would think that any of these over-age actors actually look like teenagers because we humans don't.I've long ago come to believe that the good US of A has no teenagers left in society. I think it must be that they are all hidden away in underground bunkers until they mature... well... sort of. This then reduces the crime figures.So, and until Hollywood manages to make a film depicting teenagers where they parts are actually taken up by teenagers, I will never give any film more than 3. Get grip Hollywood!!",Red Dawn
320,casmartone,Good movie but doesn't live up to the original,6,13 October 2012,"OK, this is kind of a reboot so I understood it wasn't going to be the completely same story line. That being said they did follow a similar premise but it just seemed kind of forced. The plausibility of the first movie was oddly enough more realistic with no explanation of the situation other than a montage during the opening title sequence. Some great action scenes but some of it just didn't solidify into a cohesive story. I had some time overcoming Josh from Nick's ""Josh and Drake"" fame being a action hero. Chris ""Thor"" Helmsworth plays the troubled Marine but doesn't bring the emotion of Patrick's original portrayal. Overall it just seemed rushed compared to the original. If it had another name and just a few changes it would probably have been more favorable in my mind as a different movie altogether. See it but may just wait until DVD.",Red Dawn

Simple it has a F*ing air force base (btw which explains how some planes were shot down.) The ""rebels"" were not trying to destroy the NK&R army, they were showing people, that someone was willing to stand up for the town, which worked (it even spread to other cities and states.) And why sis that NK leader say terrorists? Again simple, he had no clue how many people were on it! The freaking movie was amazing! I've seen it once, about to go again! And for those dumb a$$es who find the stupidest little reasons to hate this movie, I have one simple request - PLEASE FILM YOUR OWN MOVIE and post it online, I will see how accurate it is. BTW ONE THING it is possible for all those parachutes to be dropped down, let me explain, I am Russian, I know for a fact that between NK&R it would be easy to come up with 10,000 - 20,000 carrier planes. All power goes out in USA (that energy weapon the marine was talking about), 12 hours later US has one F*ck of an invasion (bad move telling all the hostile countries this) A regular plane can get here in what 12-14 hours...Now think military!

324,badzed311,2 hour long Rolling Rock commercial,1,24 November 2012,"It's been a while, since I have seen something this bad. In fact, I spent the whole screening time waiting for the movie to start making sense. The Koreans invade using a top secret EMP weapon that SINKS SUBMARINES (oh yeah) but leaves all electronics intact and working, with no resistance from the armed forces, apparently taking everyone by surprise. To remedy the situation, US sends 3(!) marines to take orders from a resistance cell operated by a local high school team in order to retrieve an unhackable device that lets the invading forces communicate with each other during the ""blackout"" (once again, all the electronics still work just fine). They succeed and escape to Canada, leaving the insurgent kids alone against the enemy. The Koreans seem to be completely incompetent and untrained: Not one of them can hit a target, prisoners are rounded up at a high school football team with only a few guards, when laying siege to a building, they never bother to cover the exits, etc. A mysterious Russian guy appears and is immediately identified as a counter insurgency expert. Despite this, he appears in the movie exactly twice and both time does nothing. On top of this, the product placement is pretty bad: at times it seems like the whole flick was shot by using ad money from rolling rock and hammermill. I want my 12 dollars back.",Red Dawn
325,txrst8,Not the best,4,25 November 2012,"I wouldn't say this was the best movie in the world. It certainly left a lot to be desired. I guess I was just expecting more. One of my pet peeves is the shaking camera. Any time anything happened that had even a slight bit of suspense or action, they had the camera rocking at least 45 degrees. Because of this you couldn't really see everything that was going on in the action scenes, which is the part that interests me the most. Another of my pep peeves is the lack of character development in most of the characters. The younger brother and one of the other kids are probably the only ones that actually developed. Its worth going to see but could haven been so much better.",Red Dawn

The movie came out during a time where people feared that an invasion was coming. There was a sense that it could be real. Now in the remake the actors played the roles to a tee. Peck does an amazing job as Matt and Hemsworth likewise as Jed. Just the thought of something like this happening is crazy, personally I would love to live this, the adventure, adrenaline and risk are all portrayed extremely well on the screen. Not only do you feel the action and rush of the film you feel the emotion. They did a good job at making you feel what they felt as if it was real.

327,yunchuli,Purely wasting my time,1,28 November 2012,"This story itself is not new at all and just simply a copy from the original one in 1984. So there is no surprise in it. Apparently, the movie maker did not do a literature research about the North Korea. This tiny country can hardly feed her own people and will never have the ability to invade U.S.. So the plots are really laughable. In addition, I don't understand why the original red dawn and the this one always assume that a couple of boys can defeat the invaders by themselves. If this is true, NAZI Germany would not be able to invade France and USSR. Actually, if you checked into the history, you will find out the white house was burned by British Armies in 1812. If it were not the brave French navy and soldier that helped us, U.S. would not have been able to defeat the British armies. I would ask: where were the brave boys during that time?",Red Dawn

The reason that made the original 1984 version a success was that US was in an intensive cold war with Soviet Union. There was possibility that Russian might attack America, however, the cold war has been over for 20 years. Ever since the collapse of Soviet Union, nobody else would ever have the ability to invade the homeland of a country with the military budget more than the sum of all the other countries and military bases all over the world. Even Russia, China, and Europe combined together could not even reach Hawaii! And now we are talking about N. Korean invading US? Shame on the movie makers, you stupid Hollywood suckers are insulting the IQ of the whole country! This stupid movie is just taking advantage of the harsh time to trigger the public hatred to a non-existent enemy, and turn everybody to be paranoid!

329,allison-floth,Spokane is a great city; too bad they didn't actually film there.,7,28 November 2012,"First off, this version was pretty decent. I liked the news clips and the build up during the beginning credits.I think the characters are less developed in this version than they were in the original film; I was in junior high when the first film was released and I really got the feeling that the kids in the original film were just like the kids I went to school with so I was able to connect with the original. I didn't get that connection with this version. Granted, I'm in my 40's now and maybe if I were still a teen I might feel differently, however, I have two teenage boys and I tried to watch their reactions as they watched to see if they connected with it and I don't really think they did.I think another reason I didn't connect with the film is that I actually live in Spokane and I'm a bit upset that they didn't try harder to actually portray our wonderful city in their film. I've been around film crews and I've studied film making enough to know that it wouldn't have cost them that much more to get some actual overhead shots of the city and some street shots of the buildings to make it look more like they were actually in Spokane. There are actually spots in our city that they could have done their forest scenes in if they had done their homework. I understand that if you are someone who doesn't know anything about Spokane, then you would be just fine with the scenery because you don't know any different but that aspect of it could have been better. I was disappointed and I think my boys were too.I loved that they kept the deer blood scene in the remake; it was set up a little differently and somewhat better in the original but funny just the same. I also liked the change they made to the interaction the kids have with someone who is actually in the military. I thought Powers Booth's character in the first film offered a necessary tie to what was going on in the rest of the country but I'm glad they updated it and added a couple of more characters.It wasn't ""acurate"" but it is a fictional movie created for the purpose of entertaining people. Well, I was definitely entertained and it wasn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon. I know my boys enjoyed it, too.",Red Dawn

The only function of it is simply triggering people's willingness to check if the old one in 1984 is also as crappy as this one.I have to remind the movie maker that the Cold War Is OVER!. The Soviet Union is gone. Today's world is completely different from what it was 30 years ago. The most capital country all over the world right now is China instead of U.S. We are even more like commies than Chinese are. Considering that we are spending trillions of dollars to bail out the useless corps and feed the incompetent workers, you will at least partially agree with me, if not totally. The current focus of this world is not the military invasion from some non-existing soviet empire, but the jobs, i.e. HOW TO GET OUR JOBS BACK?? If you can not make a movie practical and meaningful, that's all right.

Certain things could have been better from the writing and directing. I was confused and waiting to here in the story line how the North Koreans got hummvees but never did. I guess they learned how to bootleg them in Korea. Also, It looks like they jumped out of c-130's when they invade in the beginning. I am pretty sure if not positive North Korea has no American made jeep and transport planes in there military. Outside of these two poorly directed things it was not all that bad for an action flick.

However, all of them played their role very good. The only thing that was a bit awry about this movie was the ending. The ending was probably the worst ending i have ever seen.

They are defending themselves from an invasion. But there lies the political irony, in how the main character talks of the land being their home, and for the enemy just a 'land they would rather not be in': what do they think Afghanistan and Iraq are?Because of that irony, this film worked better 30-odd years ago with the original.

Commander of local forces biggest mission is to catch a bunch of high school kids at the beginning, while hes invading? Before they are the Wolverines?... It's not all other military in the area or police or a 1000 other things? Traps in the original that were in the woods or in the middle of no where were believable because they were in the middle of no where. They dug a bunch of trap doors in a vacant lot, in the middle of the city, right down from a military check point and no one noticed? No soldiers noticed the gun fire when they popped up? This movie, writing, directing and casting is so bad that I hope the director and writer retired after doing this disaster. It is an insult to the legacy the actors and crew the original left behind.

Well, that was not a good idea. Hollywood is making more and more movie of this kind, and the plots are almost the same : the ""great nation"" of USA being threatened by someone (or something), and then some action heroes, or some ""brave"" teenagers jump out from nowhere, give a speech, then go kill some one/ destroy some thing, and that's it, the mother nation was saved, await some more invaders to come.

I do agree the acting(excluding Hemsworth and Hutcherson) was not excellent, but the ""mistakes"" that people are pointing out are not true. They must have been distracted when the movie explained the different parts leading to and during the war. There are two specific accusations thrown against this movie that I will refute. 1) The Koreans/Russians are just attacking a small town in the middle of nowhere. Obviously if countries are invading they aren't going to take over just one little town. When the Wolverines meet the small band of marines the marines inform them that the coasts have been taken by the opposing army.2) The movie leaves out the United States military. False. They also explain our army was strewn throughout the earth on all of the little skirmishes our nation is involved with.

Agreed that the acting was below par but I believe that the plot made up for it. This is a movie for those that live in the ""conspiracy theory"" era. Could it happen in the US, absolutely, which in that perspective you can plainly see that it's not geared towards those that were around to watch the original but to the youth of our nation. If an event like this were to take place then those would be the one's that would need to bare arms and take the nation back. I think theirs a deeper meaning to the movie that has more of a realism than it does fine acting.

Sure at points the film probably was a little far-fetched. But as regards to the storyline, why wouldn't the North Koreans attack the USA, they are probably one of a handful of countries that could do it. Why wouldn't they pick a small town to invade, who in their right mind would just attack a city first, like anything start small.Teenagers fought in the 2 world wars (and not all of which died I'm sure) so that could quite possibly happen in real life, especially with the aid of a brother that has had experience in the war. You could look at more or less any film with a one man stand against something (bet most enjoyed films like Rambo, Predator, Taken, even Home Alone 1 & 2 etc..) and say how unrealistic it was. How could he take on all those people alone, blah blah blah, I didn't see enough people getting shot in the head close up blah blah blah.... What are films meant to be about, how a town would get invaded and how no-one fought back, let them take over and rule them. Or maybe how they did fight back but got wiped out in seconds? Who would go and see those films? Show of hands anyone..... anyone? No? Exactly.Anyone that rated this film a 1 Star clearly have no idea about either films or the genre in general. This film has more or less everything you would want to make it a good watch.It has a good (granted not brilliant) storyline that keeps you watching throughout, well above average acting, good action scenes and enjoyable effects.

353,fake_fake_ekaf_ekaf,Need a filter to even watch,1,30 March 2013,"The only way to watch this movie without cringing yourself into a husk is to replace every instance of ""Korea"" with ""China."" That is truly the only way to get started watching this movie. Even with China, the premise is totally bunk, but for the sake of time, let's set aside the realistic constraints (ugh).First, if they were trying to make a bad film, they failed. Bad films are fun to point at and laugh. They sell on the basis of being fun to laugh at. However, this wasn't a bad film. This was a shameful film. This is a film that no one involved would even dare to mention it on their resume. This is the sort of film that could be uploaded onto you tube in HD in its entirety, and no one would claim it out of sheer embarrassment. Heck, with all the product placement, it's more of a 90 minutes advert than intellectual property.Second, faulty acting is at least fun to laugh at if you get the sense that they were trying, but no where in this film do you ever get that sense. I can't even mention the names of these actors without fearing a slander suit. I really can't.Now, for some story criticism. It starts off with a football game. Take a moment to roll your eyes and sigh over the social ""progress"" we've made since 1984. We have a high school quarterback (who looks like he's old enough to be one of the teachers) {Mumbles}, a coach with rage issues, and a cheerleader who's so skinny, she's skin and bones, if by skin you mean skin-colored paint {Skeletona}. Seriously, an 80-year-old Chinese peasant farmer has more meat on his bones. Of course, he loses and feels bad about it because he couldn't study hard enough to make any other career path viable (besides custodian). Then, some guy on leave {Marine} goes to a restaurant and has awkward flirting with some girl {Miss Melons}, who later decides to approach Mumbles and Skeletona on the other side, when a power outage happens. Mumbles returns home to find his dad {Cop} and his brother, Marine, talking about something unmemorable.The next morning, paratroopers are landing using WW2 vintage parachutes, and houses explode like propane factories when planes crash into them (apparently). Mumbles and Marine look for Cop, who suggests they run for some cabin while he stays behind, even though their flatbed could have carried so many others to safety. Oh well, see you dad. They run into some friends on the way, who are able to join them in their truck after magically dodging bullets that were never fired at all. A truck's recklessly picking up able-bodied men, and these ruthless communist invaders never think to shoot. That makes perfect sense! Oh, and a side note: it's considered an insult in Asia pass off a Japanese/Korean/Chinese as someone of a different ethnicity. Just to let you know. Also, it's best to hire native speakers instead of the Chinese equivalent of Tommy Wiseau and every bad foreign accent in existence. Again, we're pretending they're all Chinese, remember? They manage to escape into the woods and find guns and Miss Melons! However, those clever Chinese soldiers found their hiding place, while they conveniently slipped away, thanks to a {Collaborator}. They drag out Cop and {Mayor}, to wage some psychological warfare, but it's not good enough for our protagonists. Cop gets offed, and the gang decides to become rebels. 1 Marine + dozen high schoolers? That's the formula for success (and child soldiers)! It's OK if they're American! In a matter of a 2-minute montage, they learn: close quarters combat; first aid; electrical engineering; firing discipline; hunting; ambushing; and much more! All while looking like they get showers and a warm bed every night! They even get back at collaborator! But they get ambushed, of course, and Mumbles tries to rescue Skeletona, even though there's an entire bus load of other prisoners to rescue. That's right. There's an entire bus load with her, and he's only concerned with the anorexic one that looks pampered up like none other. Too bad, bus load of prisoners, you're only extras in the eyes of Mumbles.Mumbles becomes a drama queen, and has an ""emotional"" moment with Marine. Then, in a matter of a dozen or so bombs, an entire forest is burnt down, and the hideout is destroyed. They run into three more Marines, and use their cellphones (magically powered cellphones) to find an important clue, known as a Deus Ex Machina (DEM). It looks suspiciously similar to the secret Intel from CoD: MW2. They steal the DEM, but while they relax, Marine is killed, and they escape a city guarded on all sides by checkpoints IN A STATION WAGON. They're lucky that the occupying force didn't have any planes with which to bomb them.They realize that the token black was tagged, and, demonstrating how far we've come in race relations, we see the filmmakers wait until the final act to kill off the token black man.Then, they decide to rescue a bunch of prisoners from a dozen Chinese guards. The end.Well, I hope this will convince you not to watch. If my description seemed to exaggerate in some places for dramatic effect, I DIDN'T. ALL THE EVENTS HERE ACTUALLY HAPPENED!

What makes the original so good, is what makes this so BAD. Characters. Feeling for them, understanding their relationships, feeling a connection, this piece of junk does none of that. When Robert says goodbye to Daryl, it's supposed to be this tearful parting, you feel nothing because no connection was ever made between the two.

Patrick Swayze is turning over in his grave. And were supposed to believe that Matt would forsake everything for a girl? If that happened in the first movie, Robert would have shot him on sight. Nothing about this movie is believable. Oh, and considering that the movie was most of the time so dark you really couldn't tell what was going on pays homage to poor cinematography and even worse editing.

361,jrrdube-703-736821,Almost as bad as 'Titanic 2'!,1,20 August 2013,"The most frustrating thing about this latest attempt to rip off an 80's original idea, is that it COULD have been better than the original. It had an interesting idea, good actors, Hemsworth, Cullen and Morgan, but for some reason those making the movie got lazy. The first 20-30 minutes are good, but after that, it is either overused clichés, cheesy drama, or just plain nonsense. It almost seems that either they didn't know where to go with the movie, or it was re-written to death, or edited to death. The original movie was silly at times, but believable overall, this incarnation is just stupid most of the time. One huge plot hole would be why didn't Jed return to his base, and instead went to hide in the woods? Another would be the premise of an EMP type weapon disabling NORAD, and all military equipment, when most are specifically designed for that purpose. But the biggest oversight would be that China and North Korea could 'surprise' America like they did, when before they cross the Pacific, a country named Japan might have said something?! I compare this movie to 'Titanic 2' because this movie has so many holes, it is like a sinking ship! Also because afterwards you feel like reinacting the famous scene from 'Network', by going outside your home and screaming in rage!There should be a vote of the most pointless death by a title character. Hemsworth's is almost as pointless/stupid/silly as Gene Hackman's in 'The Poseidon Adventure', or DiCaprio's in 'The Departed'! But to expect anything less would be an error on our part. When the movie was shelved for over two years, that should have been the hint to avoid this disaster, as the studios have never shelved a masterpiece, just filth that should have been released as a B movie, or straight to Blu Ray. If they did that it would have saved some the $50 to go out and find out on the big screen, what a piece of garbage this movie is.",Red Dawn

Do the actors a favor and pass on this flop so as you won't judge them in their future endeavors. Maybe in another 20 years someone will come around and make a version that actually captures the essence of gun collector fantasies and boyish hero daydreams. It's seems almost unsportsmen like to pick this movie apart, like prodding a wounded animal with a sharpened stick. There is nothing so bad about this movie that it should insult the viewer (Like the movie ""2012"" with John the Tool Cusack) however, if one has not seen the original version of Red Dawn, which the new one assumes of the viewer, then this 2012 version of Red Dawn should be utterly frustrating.",Red Dawn

I really love Chris Hemsworth's acting in Thor, The Avengers and of course Red Dawn. It really isn't fair to compare it to the 1984 version with most of those actors that are in my age range (late 40's-early 50's) plus it is way better than most television garbage that seems to captivate most folks.

There were no amazing special effect like in 2012, which you need when the characters are so dull. It doesn't bother me that this scenario was realistic. What bugged me was that it was a dirge of Americanism which much of the world (including us allies) cannot relate to. What happened in 2012 that you felt the need to big-up?. I can't understand how millions can be spent on a film and seems like nothing spent on time with the actors to perform so that we might have the slightest sympathy for them.

I had only a vague idea of what the first movie was, so there was nothing keeping me from enjoying it purely because it was a remake. What I got was spectacularly... average.The plot is relatively simple, if not unbelievable. North Korea somehow invades and takes over the United States, and through sheer luck and determination, a bunch of high-school students guided by a returning marine are able to form a resistance group and prove to be a real thorn in North Korea's side. Let me reiterate... high-school students take on a professional military, capable of overthrowing the United States... and are taken more seriously than the actual military. If you know anyone in the military, Navy, Air Force, or any defensive organization, you may feel somewhat offended by the implications.The action progresses almost too quickly for any real impact, but in some cases that's alright. The action is generally well choreographed, and plays out excitingly enough. Unfortunately, the end result feels like a high-school student's rushed Creative Writing assignment, and consequently doesn't fulfill many expectations.If you don't feel like paying close attention to a movie, or are just in the mood for some dumb, generally mindless entertainment, look no further. Otherwise, look much further.",Red Dawn

Two, It make more sense how they learn to fight back. In the original, they just start fight with almost too well place tactic.

369,Uniphikus,"Not Just a Bad Film, but Also a Bad Action Movie",1,11 March 2013,"**SPOILER ALERT, IT WAS AGONIZING**Tom Clancy, an author who built his legacy on 'world gone mad' scenarios, once said that 'the difference between fiction & reality is that fiction has to make sense.' Take a look at any of his work & you find yourself shrugging & saying, 'okay, Tom, I can get past your deviations from the real world & go on this ride with you.' Spend 5 minutes watching this film, though, and you'll start wondering why its writers think you have the education & critical thinking skills of a malnourished, indoctrinated North Korean peasant conscript. Suspension of belief is a very important part of fiction writing. This concept is absolutely critical when a story is supposed to take place in a world not too far from our own. It is a subtle process built upon thousands of details that should shift the mind of its audiences ever so gently so they can keep watching & enjoying the story & not have to stop every few minutes & wondering at some absurdity in the plot. The premise of the original was based on shaky enough ground as is. The Cold War had been in full swing for 40 years when the 1984 version came out, though, & fears of conventional war against Warsaw Pact nations was a somewhat legitimate one. At the start of Red Dawn(2012) the audience is, not asked, but told to believe that an impoverished & famished nation that is living in a time bubble circa 1950-something has not only developed, in secret, a high tech EMP & the ability to cross the entirety of the Pacific ocean to stage a surprise attack, invade & then occupy the U.S. The audience is fed exactly 1 tidbit of dialogue as to how this feat was made possible; ""they must have had help."" Right. The audience is then told to believe that the most expensive, highly trained & well equipped military in the world can do absolutely nothing for its population. Time and again the viewer is fed logical fallacies & told to choke them down in order for maximum enjoyment of this film. If your mind is able to overcome this hurdle then you'll soon find that pointing out the many fallacies in the movie is the only way to enjoy actually enjoy it. Josh Peck delivers one of the worst performances of this decade. He mopes about the screen even when he's not moping; the 90s goth kid somehow cast as a quarterback in the 21st century. He also squints a lot & his character's chronic self doubt seems to carry over into his acting job. Chris Hemsworth does a respectable enough job with the pile of garbage that was handed to him; but don't watch this movie if you want to see why he's a passable action star. The plot jerks along from one contrived shoot 'em up, blow 'em up scene to the next. The heroes always have an implausible escape route. Again, the writers telling us to believe that the North Koreans aren't smart enough to entirely surround a building or something else as obvious. The breaks are punched suddenly & you're thrown through the windshield that is the bad delivery of bad dialogue in the slower scenes. You are left to writhe in shattered glass while watching characters, whose names you can't remember, be stale at each other. The original served us up a fine fantasy action film. It was grittier & you could see the hardships the kids had to endure; they were hungry & filthy with nothing but their ideals & guns to cling to. A lot of the kids ended up dying in the 1984 version & rightfully so. Red Dawn(2012) tries to tell us that war is nothing like Call of Duty but the writers must have realized that they are the only ones capable of loving their bad characters & so they did not have the heart to kill any of them off. The 1984 original asked us to believe that American teenagers could be placed in the position to enact a local insurgency against a foreign invader & they were kind enough to show us that it would cost a lot of blood & work to keep our way of life should ever a scenario rear its ugly head. Red Dawn(2012) keeps afloat some absurd American daydream of our enemies being more potent than they actually are & that all you have to do is look pretty for your country, spout B.S. & you'll succeed.",Red Dawn

It seems all bad reviews either stem from Josh Peck hatred or those who have seen the original and feel biased towards it. (Understandable) The original Red Dawn is an absolute mess. The film quality and acting in that movie is absolutely horrendous. The special effects? laughable. For instance when the Soviets land they are wearing white winter camouflage in a place with nothing but greens and browns! Not a speck of snow around! (not for half the movie at least)The new Red Dawn does indeed have its flaws. The storyline is great. The supporting actors are amazing. Although Josh Peck could lose the permanent smirk.For overall quality the original just cant stand up to this one, the special effects and acting make it 10 times more believable.

Honestly I really enjoyed watching this movie and I would definitely watch it again, it involves a deep storyline and you can easily get into it.

376,aviglesias,One of the top 10 worst movies i have ever seen,1,2 September 2014,"A few months ago I bought this movie (at a pathetically low price) and took it home and popped it in to watch. I turned it off just 10 minutes in, aching with emotional heartache at this atrocity of a remake. Months later I was surfing Netflix and decided to give this ""movie"" another shot. Finishing this movie may have been the most trying hardship I have EVER been through, and I have been through as much as the next guy. What director in there right mind would cast some Nickelodeon burnout as the main hero. As for the rest of the C Team cast, consider your careers short and unpleasant. I suppose besides Chris Hemsworth. It was amazing to see a bunch of punk as*** go from generic Adolescents to one of the most elite fighting forces on the planet, enough so that the trained North Korean Army was defeated by them more times than the laugh track played on Drake and Josh. If my memory serves me, the REAL Wolverines from the original weren't so into high-jacking buses in the middle of the zone, or stealing some lame as* secret weapon briefcase, they were a little more realistic in that they blew things up and then immediately retreated. However I must say that Josh Peck did a wonderful job in making me utterly hate him and any t.v. show or movie that he has even been associated with. Stephen Hawking would have been a better pick for an action movie that this Mel Gibson wanna be. If Josh Peck ever told me to ""move my ass"" I would smack him so hard he would wake up on the set of the ""Amanda Show"" As all of this was going through my mind, I was wondering what this Director was thinking while filming this POS. Upon further research I came to understand that the movie in fact did not have a director, It had an untalented stunt coordinator trying to play Michael Bay, which resulted in one of the decades greatest filmography failures so far. Dear Director (thy name shall not escapeth from mine tongue) please for the love of Humanity and America please never even lay eyes on a script again. At one point in the movie I was so horrified with Mr. Pecks acting capabilities, I was actually rooting for the North Korean, I expected a plot twist where Kim-Jong-Un would break into the set and Rip Josh Pecks treasonous head right from his shoulders, and show himself as the true protagonist. If I could sue you for damages, being time wasted Director I would gladly do so.",Red Dawn
377,johndivney17,Red Dawn Should Have Stayed in the Dark,3,25 September 2014,"Red Dawn may have one of the most appropriately ironic titles in movie history as it never should have seen the light of day again. Red Dawn originally came out in 1984 with big names like Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen, and was revamped in 2012 with Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck. From an improbable war stratagem, we should have known better than to watch this movie. The movie, originally directed by John Milius, is the story of how a motley group of teens becomes a formidable resistance force when their peaceful community is suddenly attacked by the Russians who, in the 80s, were still under scrutiny after the Cold War. Writers Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore made the North Koreans the invaders in the 2012 movie. The 2012 version opens to a football game in which Matt (Josh Peck), a hot-headed senior quarterback, sees his older brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) after his return from a tour in Afghanistan. After this brief introduction to the brothers, we are immediately thrown into a full –scale invasion early next morning by North Korean Paratroopers, bombers, and tanks. Focusing on the logistics of an invasion of that magnitude, this movie is suggesting three rather improbable things. First, the US military's defense system must have been knocked out by the North Koreans. The idea that North Korean forces could hack into a system that formidable countries like China and Russia have failed to gain access to is laughable. Second, the US's invasion into Normandy, the largest invasion in military history, was about an 8 hour flight. The flight from North Korea to Washington is about 12 hours. This flight is nigh impossible for the amount of resources in North Korea, and certainly impossible with the US's Navy patrolling the entire Pacific Ocean. That brings up the third obstacle the North Koreans would have had to climb over – the US's Navy. Known as the best Navy in the world, US vessels would have to be sunk by the invaders on the way from Korea to Washington so they would not alert the US of the invasion. Put all of these hurdles together, and the sheer audacity of the invasion should sink in. For the sake of dramatic illusion, let's say that we ignore the implausible invasion. The action scenes in the movie are more explosive than the original, but some are unbelievable. For example, when the rebels conduct an ambush that happens right outside of the town the North Koreans have occupied there is gunfire that the guards at the gate adjacent apparently didn't hear. They also have a series of shots in which the rebels are training and practicing shooting. Why doesn't anybody hear the gunshots? What about all of the ammo they waste practicing? We as movie goers shouldn't blame anyone but ourselves for watching a revamp of a movie in the 80s like Red Dawn. Instead, we should make conscious decisions on what we watch. Take the lesson from me: refuse to be tricked into wasting the next two or three hours the next time you sit down to watch Netflix with a bowl of popcorn; and look into your movies.",Red Dawn

Sure, this plot and sequence of events are extremely unrealistic in many aspects, but it's hard to deny that throughout the storyline, you weren't the least bit intrigued. Although the acting may not have been Academy Award winning, it wasn't so bad that it left you annoyed and unable to focus on the movie itself.
