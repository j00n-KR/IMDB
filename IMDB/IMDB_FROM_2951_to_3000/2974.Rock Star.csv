0,SnoopyStyle,Liked Wahlberg,6,8 June 2014,"It's Pittsburg in the 80s. Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) idolizes the band Steel Dragon and works tirelessly to emulate them in a tribute band. His girlfriend Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston) is his biggest fan. He repairs copying machines and still lives at home. His cop brother dismisses his dream. After an on stage fight with his guitarist Rob (Timothy Olyphant), he is kicked out of the band as they want to start playing their own music. Then a surprise call from Steel Dragon guitarist Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West) for Chris to audition for the band as he fires the lead singer Bobby Beers.Mark Wahlberg has good likability as the dreamer and does a good rock star imitation. Jennifer Aniston is pretty good. She isn't doing anything out of her comfort zone. There are some rocking music even if Marky Mark doesn't do the singing. It's an earnest recreation like a tribute band. What this movie needs is a lot more jokes. Falling off the stairs could have been funny but it's played very seriously. The story is just too filled with clichés for me to take seriously. It feels very superficial and not gritty enough. In the end, I enjoyed Wahlberg's commitment to his character.",Rock Star
1,gavin6942,The Story of Journey?,5,18 January 2016,"Lead singer of a tribute band (Marky Mark) becomes lead singer of the real band he idolizes.So, I see comments saying this is another movie Jennifer Aniston ruined. Well, that is half true. She definitely makes it worse and every scene she is in amounts to a steaming pile of doo. Even her voice is grating and it is hard to take her seriously.But the movie would have stunk either way. It has a good idea, sort of, especially since this really happened (to Journey). But it is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious enough to be a drama. It just sort of... is. It would have been significantly better if it had a little more humor in it and could have been passed off as a mockumentary. I mean, yeah, we already have ""Spinal Tap"", but it wouldn't have to be that silly.",Rock Star
2,moonspinner55,Comic book cynicism,7,15 August 2002,"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous"". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****",Rock Star
3,Quinoa1984,"Some things to look for, Wahlberg isn't one of them",4,15 September 2001,"Mark Wahlberg, the star of Rock Star, seems not totally right for this movie.  Not just because of the Marky Mark past image, but also because he seems uncomfortable sometimes in the movie.  Sure he might have a god singing voice as a hairband lead singer, but that might not totally compensate in my book.  It would've helped a little if it looked like he was having a little more, well, fun.  Both Wahlberg and the film have something in common- they take themselves too seriously.Still, the film has it's moments.  They're are a good number of in-jokes and puns at the rock industry (It's no Spinal Tap though), some alright rock music, and a good feel for the period.  But, the film becomes muddles after what we know the plot is is established.  Formula, toppled with formula, with only a tad of compensation.  By the way, though the film might sound original with it's plot, it's actually based (in part of course) on the events that transpired with Judas Priest when they kicked Rob Halford out of the band (you might even spot a gay reference here or there).  B-",Rock Star
4,michaelRokeefe,Live the fantasy that others only dream about.,7,13 August 2002,"This movie is a lot better than you imagine. Chris Cole is the lead singer of a tribute band that is swept off his feet when he is asked to join the real group and then drowns in the world of sex, drugs and heavy metal. Mark Wahlberg plays the part of Cole and eases into the role excellently probably due to his own musical background. Jennifer Aniston plays Emily, Cole's love interest and manager. She can only stand so much of watching Cole sink lower and deeper into the decadent world associated with the band. Emily leaves to start a new life in Seattle and later Cole comes to his senses when he realizes that the Steel Dragon does not want his input more than his sexually willing body and voice to sustain the group. Cole hands over the mic to an eager wannabe and trades in his heavy metal wardrobe for jeans and sweaters and singing his own songs in front of half-filled coffee houses in Seattle.Like I said, Wahlberg is excellent in the role. I've never been an Aniston fan, but she really is impressive in this movie. Timothy Spall is moderately funny in the role as the Steel Dragon's road manager. Lending their individual talents to make the film more believable are: Jason Bonham, Timothy Olyphant, Brian Van Ark, Jeff Pilson, Jason Flemyng and Dominic West.Besides the music of Steel Dragon and their tribute band Blood Pollution there is original music from the likes of Kiss, Ted Nugent, Bon Jovi, Everclear and Motley Crue. Note: This story is reportedly roughly based on the story of Judas Priest's Tim ""Ripper"" Owens.",Rock Star
5,sunwarrior13,A RomCom At A Rock And Roll Setting,8,28 June 2014,"Rock Star is a musical drama that tells the story of Chris ""Izzy"" Cole,a tribute band singer that replaced the lead vocalist of his favorite band,Steel Dragon.It stars Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. John Stockwell wrote the story and Stephen Herek directed the film.Izzy is a wannabe rock star.He works as a copy machine repairman at day and is the lead vocalist of Blood Pollution,a tribute band that imitates the hugely popular Steel Dragon.She is supported by Emily,who is his girlfriend and business manager of the band.One day,there members of the band got into an argument that led to the dismissal of Chris from the group.However,he later got a call from Steel Dragon to audition.After the rehearsal with them,Chris got offered to join the group as their new lead vocalist.The band went on to be successful with him but later he realized that there is more to life than being in the limelight. I got into the film after reading the story of Journey's new vocalist,Arnel Pineda.His story is definitely similar to the movie although it happened after 7 years the movie was released.It was synonymous in the sense that a once Journey cover singer Arnel got to become Journey's frontman. It was interesting to note though that the movie was inspired from Judas Priest but what happened was even life imitated art in history of Journey that is why I was entertained with the movie.As a whole though,I felt that the movie just provided us a glimpse on the world of rock and roll bands as it fell into cliché after cliché of a typical romantic comedy that provides both humor and life lessons as the conclusion comes near.In short,there was really nothing original and refreshing about it expect probably the fact that we have story on a rock and roll setting.",Rock Star
6,zardoz-13,"Director Stephen Herek's sense of style helps to make ""Rock Star"" palatable",5,7 February 2008,"Writing about flawed films sometimes is more fun than writing about fabulous ones. Flawed films interest me for what they aspired to rather than achieved. Take director Stephen Herek's ""Rock Star,"" for example, a cinematic experience as amiable but anemic as its generic title. The original title was ""Metal God,"" and the studio should have kept it. Somewhere beneath this superficial but alluring epic penned by actor, writer, & sometime director John Stockwell lurks a better movie. Imagine a diluted version of ""The Doors"" meets ""The Jazz Singer."" The shoddy third act resolution generates little catharsis. ""Rock Star"" lacks a physical villain, so our hero has nobody to contend with but himself. As charismatic as Mark Wahlberg is, he struggles valiantly to make an impression as a remote, aloof character devoid of ambiguity. Poor Jennifer Aniston vanishes in the second act, only to return late in act three to provide closure to a routine romance. Wahlberg and Aniston make a good couple, but their romance evaporates in act two. ""Rock Star"" is neither as provocative as 1979's ""The Rose"" with Bette Midler"" nor as satiric as Rob Reiner's classic ""This Is Spinal Tap."" This middle-of-the-road rock'n' roll opera doesn't rock enough but rolls briskly to its inevitable cautionary conclusion. Be yourself is the message. Essentially, Herek & Stockwell adapted the real-life Cinderella saga of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Akron, Ohio, musician who idolized British head bangers Judas Priest, but turned it into inoffensive potboiler. Happily, director Stephen Herek of ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" and ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" ushers a supremely competent cast through their paces. Even when this harmless, 106 minute expose of fame isn't terribly profound, Herek makes it infinitely easy to watch, thanks in part to both Ueli Steiger's atmospheric cinematography and Trudy Ship's snappy editing.""Rock Star"" unfolds during the noisy Reagan years of the 1980s. By day, Pittsburgh native Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg of ""Three Kings"") toils as a photo-copier repair technician and lives at home in his parents' day-care center. (I liked the way Herek & Stockwell inserted the clever symbolism about a copier repairman who copies a rock star.) By night, Chris lets his hair down and boogies with Blood Pollution, a heavy-metal tribute band to fictitious British rockers Steel Dragon. Incidentally, neither Judas Priest nor Tim Owens sought to be associated with ""Rock Star,"" which explains why Herek & Stockwell have embellished things. Anyway, Chris has been grooving on Steel Dragon since his disappointed big brother Joe dumped their debut album in his lap. Bad blood exists between Chris and Joe; Joe happens to be a uniformed patrolman. Chris' girlfriend Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston of TV's ""Friends"") serves as Blood Pollution's manager. So absorbed and obsessed is Chris with replicating Steel Dragon tunes riff for riff that he refuses to tolerate the least departure from their original material. Chris's fanaticism aggravates fellow guitarist & friend Rob (smarmy Timothy Olyphant of ""Scream 2"") who claims the fans won't object to his improvisations. Eventually, during a concert at a steel factory, Chris catches Rob improvising, and the two scrap on stage. Later, when Chris and Emily show up for a practice session in the basement of a porno movie theatre, Rob announces they have replaced Chris. An argument erupts, and Chris discovers to his horror that his friends consider themselves a 'cover band' instead of 'a tribute band.' They exploit Steel Dragon tunes to lure in audiences and then regale them with their own originals. Chris throws a tantrum and storms out with Emily at his heels. No sooner has this happened than Chris receives a call from Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West of ""28 Days"") of Steel Dragon. Initially, Chris suspects he is being duped until Kirk convinces him beyond a shadow of a doubt. Sworn to secrecy, Chris shares two of his groupie friends, Nina and Samantha, and Steel Dragon wants him to audition for lead singer. Chris and Emily fly out to L.A., and Chris discovers to his chagrin that Steel Dragon lead singer Bobby Beers is gay. Apparently, Bobby (Jason Flemyng of ""Snatch"") has been neglecting his responsibilities to the band, and Steel Dragon axes him.Before long, Emily and Chris realize they cannot stay together. She heads off to Seattle with a girlfriend to open a coffee shop. Fellow band member A.C. (Jason Bonham, son of the late ""Led Zeppelin"" drummer John Bonham) advises Chris to let Emily go, too. Says A.C.: ""Your job is to live the fantasy other people only dream about. Dream big--live the life."" The next time Chris sees Emily, he is so wasted he doesn't realize he is in Seattle where she runs her coffee shop. Herek & Stockwell give this section of ""Rock Star"" the short shrift. Several scenes appear to be missing, because the drama dries up in the third act. Eventually, Chris learns success with Steel Dragon comes at a price. A.C. and Kirk write all the songs, and they scoff at Chris's ideas and songs. Unlike most movies where the characters neither grow nor evolve, Chris does grow and winds up hitting the road to do his own thing.The cast performs splendidly. Mark Wahlberg is thoroughly persuasive as the naive, gullible Chris. The major shortcomings in ""Rock Star"" lay with John Stockwell's shallow script that gives Wahlberg nothing to work with in fleshing out a bone and blood character. Chris suffers minimally at the hands of Steel Dragon. He doesn't experience a baptism by fire that would reform him. Herek & Stockwell do an adequate job of recreating the era of big hair styles. This expose exposed little which hasn't already been exposed. The soundtrack qualifies as something of a consolation. The problem with ""Rock Star"" is it is just too upbeat. The performers are more interesting than their roles. Ultimately, director Stephen Herek's sense of style helps to make ""Rock Star"" palatable.",Rock Star
7,anaconda-40658,Schlock of Ages.,3,15 September 2015,"Rock Star (2001): Dir: Stephen Herek / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Dominic West, Jason Bonham, Timothy Olyphant: Rock mock documentary about how far we will go to become more than we are. It stars Mark Wahlberg who dreams of being just like the lead singer of Steel Dragon. After his band disowns him Mark Wahlberg is excited when Steel Dragon contacts him. The rest is a life of massive concerts, drunken orgies, and corruption by management. Directed by Stephen Herek who also made Mr. Holland's Opus, also about a music career but the difference is in position. Mr. Holland teaches music while Wahlberg performs it. Between the two Mr. Holland seems to have a better screenwriter telling his story. Wahlberg holds his own portraying a character who cannot identify with himself and seeks someone else's life. We know where this is headed but since Wahlberg had a real life music career, he seems fitting for the material. Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is flat. She is basically there to bitch about him not being around and then pout and leave. Dominic West and Jason Bonham play fellow musicians with no personalities given. Other roles are drab stereotypes that accompany a screenplay so heavily burdened with clichés that it is difficult to focus on a message. Lots of loud music and energy burnt on absolutely nothing. On the positive side, Almost Famous is more compelling. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Rock Star
8,HotToastyRag,"Pretty bad, only for Marky Mark fans",1,12 June 2017,"Okay, let's be honest: The only reason anyone would sit through this movie is because she has a huge crush on Mark Wahlberg. That being said, I've sat through it.Rock Star is everything you'd expect in a movie about a, well, rock star. Wild performances, drugs, booze, blackout parties, sex, more sex, and Mark Wahlberg. I'm sure there are people who actively seek out those types of movies, but I just haven't met any. Unless you really, really adore him, you'd be better off skipping this one. Jennifer Aniston even regretted making it, and when a star badmouths her own movie, you know it's a bad sign.If you're like me, there's no use trying to talk sense into you. I've sat through so many terrible movies, all for love of eye candy. I understand your plight.

9,movieman_kev,NOT a metal movie,2,21 January 2005,"Marky Mark is the lead singer in a cover band and gets to play with the band he worships after the fire their lead singer in this dud 'inspired VERY loosely by' the story of Tim Owens of Judas Priest. The basic story of guy craves fame, gets it, screws a transvestite, parties, loses girl, quits band to cut his hair and become a poof in a coffeehouse band, gets girl back, the end. There are so many things that don't work well in this movie. Jennifer Aniston is miscast. The ending is the biggest pile of horse manure.And you don't make a movie about metal and then have a lame soundtrack, among other things. Writer John Stockwell wrote Cheaters and Blue Crush so in retrospect it's no surprise that this movie blows. The only good parts were some of the acting, and that Zakk Wylde is in it. That's pretty much it.My Grade:D+ DVD Extras: Commentary with Stephen Herek; Making-of featurette; Everclear music video; cast & crew bios; and Theatrical Trailer Eye Candy: Various big breasted groupies show what they got",Rock Star
10,Wuchakk,The late 80s/early 90s metal scene,7,12 March 2014,"2001's ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the metal band Judas Priest, who hired the lead singer of an Ohio JP tribute band, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, after losing their original singer, Rob Halford, aka 'the metal god' (taken from the Priest song ""Metal Gods""), which explains why the movie was originally to be called ""The Metal God"". All the major plot points of this film parallel the Judas Priest story; only the names and times have been altered.In ""Rock Star"" the band is Steel Dragon (fictional of course), the singer of the tribute band is Chris 'Izzy' Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and the man he's replacing is Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng). Jennifer Aniston plays Izzy's girlfriend Emily and the Steel Dragon band members include Dominic West (who's excellent as always), Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson and Zakk Wylde. Timothy Spall and Dagmara Dominczyk also have prominent roles as Steel Dragon's road manager and public relations manager respectively.The Ripper Owens story is an excellent tale for a film and this is a good movie, but the times are a bit off. In reality Rob Halford left Judas Priest in late 1991, corresponding to the advent of grunge, and Ripper Owens replaced him in early 1996; in the film the original singer leaves circa 1989 and the tribute band singer replaces him almost immediately. Ripper Owens didn't leave Judas Priest until 2003 whereas Izzy obviously leaves somewhere around late 1991/early 1992.""Rock Star"" is just an enjoyable experience, especially if you're personally familiar with the 80s/early 90s' metal scene. The soundtrack includes numerous great songs from that era, as well as the 70s (like Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold""). Unfortunately there's not one cut by Judas Priest (!). Apparently Judas Priest were originally linked to the project but ultimately disassociated themselves due to failing to reach a financial agreement for the rights to the story; this is when the producers decided to ""re-imagine"" the tale, as they say. This is all well and good but shouldn't there be as least one Priest song in the soundtrack? Where's the justice? The film takes the middle road between advocating the rock star lifestyle and decrying it. It shows both the glories and the pitfalls. When something's no longer fun and genuine it's simply time to move on -- to thine own self be true. Such experiences naturally have both positive and negative elements. Even if the experience ends up being more bad than good it's a necessary stepping stone to who you ultimately become, that is, who you are, your true success. A good example is Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. (check out their 2009 album BABYLON to get my drift).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Some criticize the movie on the grounds that Chris (Izzy) turns to playing grunge in Seattle after leaving Steel Dragon, maintaining that he was a 'poser' all along. But didn't Rob Halford himself explore different styles of music when he left Judas Priest, in particular the band Two? In the film Chris accomplishes his dream and by the end has had his fill of the whole 'rock star' phenomenon with all its ridiculous trappings; he was older & wiser now and understandably wanted to write his OWN songs (as he wasn't allowed in Steel Dragon, neither was Ripper in real life) and opts to explore his art. Keep in mind that Ripper himself was a grunge fan and fronted a grunge tribute band called Seattle in the early 90s. When Chris leaves Steel Dragon grunge is the flavor of the month and he just goes with it; he's still young and he's exploring, that's it. I'm sure he'll go on to revisit his metal roots in the future just as Rob Halford ultimately did after his 90s' meanderings; the film just doesn't take us that far ahead. ***END SPOILER*** FINAL WORD: ""Rock Star"" may not be great but it's certainly an enjoyable film on the late 80s/early 90s music scene. It's equal parts dramatic, fun, funny, realistic, inspiring, educational and sobering.GRADE: B (6.5/10) INCIDENTAL NOTE: I was the guitarist/songwriter for a metal band in the early 90s and we opened up for Tim Owens' JP tribute band in Youngstown, OH in the winter of 1995. I knew the guitarist of his band and I got to meet Tim. A year later he was a friggin' member of Judas Priest(!).",Rock Star
11,mm-39,Realistic,7,8 September 2001,"Spoiler!!!!  I found this movie realistic.  I know the critics will hate this.  When I was a teenager, the media and boomers hated heavy metal; it did not reflect the Beatles culture of the past.  In fact it destroyed it, like what Rap did to metal.  I grew up in the 80's and wondered what it would of been like to live that Rock Star dream, of over excess.  This film is great as a almost documentary on the life.  This film shows how much fun fame, excess, and the continual high is, but shows the realities of excess, like too much water for a plant one starts to rot, and burns out.  It would be fun to rock on 15 000 fans, and live with the adulation of millions, but it has a cost.  The cost of excess on personal relationships, on one's values, what one is really expected to do in order to fit it.  The pecking order of the band, and what the members really want.  The lead character finds out the old lead singer is gay, and lived a quiet life, not this heterosexual full steam, party and die image.  In the end, the Roadie told of his chance at normality, and how he gave up a wife and kids for these demands.  Chris(Izzy) chose to live normality, instead of being with some stripper who wanted her turn on the ride before she had to go to work.  As in all scenes, we see that the fad of metal die and a more wimpy grunge era begin.  Instead of fading away with it, he choose to be with the one he loves.",Rock Star
12,MovieAddict2016,Laughably bad to the point of unintentional self-satire,5,29 December 2005,"Marky Mark Wahlberg plays a rock star wannabe who rocks out at rock concerts with his rockin' girlfriend and rocking friends. He gets into fights with competing rock band members and his older brother, who hates rock music and is a police officer, makes fun of him for being a wannabe rock star.So the titular rock star eventually becomes a real rock star, headlining his favorite rock band as a rock singer.Notice how I keep using the word ""rock"" a lot? That's because this movie is inundated with rock - and in a bad way. Hair metal died with the '80s - making a retro picture now? It's not surprising the film didn't even recoup half of its $38,000,000 budget in theaters.I'm not picking on hair metal, but if you look at Motley Crue or KISS, at least they had attitude. The bands in this film are lame! I guess Mark thought this would be a good semi-sequel to ""Boogie Nights"" - he satirized the '70s porn industry, now why not '80s gratuity? - but, unfortunately, at the helm of director Stephen ""I Haven't Made a Good Movie in Years and Am Still Riding on the Coattails of 'Bill & Ted' and 'Mr. Holland's Opus'"" Herek, ""Rock Star"" looks like a laughable, silly picture.Oh, and Jennifer Aniston's annoying performance as Mark's girlfriend only adds to the fun.",Rock Star
13,bowmanblue,"Predictable, but better than I expected",7,16 May 2014,"Not being a massive fan of Mark Wahlberg, I really don't know why I watched this. However, I'm quite glad I did. There are some films that you just don't like for reasons you can't quite put your finger on. This is the opposite. I liked it and I don't really know why.The plot follows Mark Wahlberg as the lead singer in an eighties tribute band to the (fictional) rock gods, Steel Dragon. However, his life takes an interesting turn when the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves (or is kicked out!) and his bandmates offer Mark the job as replacement. Now, if that sounds a little hard to believe, check out the movie trivia. Apparently, a similar situation actually happened during the seventies (and before I was born, hence I'm not totally up on it).From there we see what his life is like 'living the dream' of drugs, rock and roll (and 'the other' obviously).The thing is, based on that briefest of plot summaries, you can probably guess the highs and lows (and probably eventual outcome) of the film. And you'd be right. There are no major twists in the tale. Yet, for some reason, I still found it enjoyable to watch. There's a healthy dose of sentiment, but not too much to distract from the big eighties hairdos and thumping guitar chords.Perhaps fans of rock (as I am) just automatically like it? Perhaps I just got lucky. I found it a kind of semi feel-good movie for adults.It doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, but the characters have their own charm (and special kudos to Mark's on screen parents, who, despite being 'all grown up and respectable' like to headbang with the best of them down at the gigs and mosh pits!).",Rock Star
14,dromasca,good rock film,8,27 June 2004,"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends  in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.  A dream came true? Well, almost. While starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.
I liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. Acting is quite good, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics I saw him lately, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. More problematic is the ending, which  is quite conventional, and may disappoint.  It looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. However, in an  ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film.",Rock Star
15,MLDinTN,No wonder this wasn't in theaters long...,5,17 August 2002,"Very mediocre and cliche after cliche after cliche. I rarely find a movie predictable, but this was one where I knew exactly what would happen.
Jennifer Aniston was the best part about the movie. I really wasn't expecting anything from her, but I liked her performance. I think she broke away from her Friends' character.  The music was OK also. Those were the two things that made this movie watchable since you know exactly where the story is going before it gets there.
Mark Wahlberg wasn't that great. I thought he would turn out to be a good actor from what I saw in Boogie Nights. But, he hasn't done anything great since then. I felt he was miscast in this part.  He just doesn't look like an 80's rocker to me. He's to short and small and not enough attitude.

Starring Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Timothy Spall and Timthy Olyphant it certainly doesn't lack star power.As you'd imagine being a movie about classic/glam rock the soundtrack is fantastic, right up there among the best of them though shatter any illusions you may have that it was Wahlberg singing.It's big, it's stylish and to my knowledge it's pretty damn accurate so why am I not rating this higher? I like the cast, I'm an old school rocker myself and on paper this should be a guaranteed tick in the win column from me.The construction of a movie is simple, you need a beginning a middle and an end and Rock Star has that but in a rather disjointed way. The films construction is my biggest grip, it comes across more like a Behind the Music episode than an actual movie. The protagonist walks away having learned several life lessons but the viewer (Or rather in this viewers case) it felt more empty than it should have.Rock Star is an interesting enough look at a subject rarely touched upon by the mainstream Hollywood movie industry but perhaps needed an additional 30+ minute to really flesh it out.The Good:Great castAwesome soundtrackSome brilliant visualsFirst movie ever to make Timothy Spall a successful ""Good guy""The Bad:Olyphant feels wastedOddly builtI struggled to feel for our leadsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Jennifer Aniston holds the secret of eternal youthThey could/should have found Wahlberg a better wigBallet is where rock stars go to die",Rock Star
17,Floated2,Has its moments but ultimately cliche and predictable,5,31 May 2020,"This film tells a relatively simple story of a young man dreaming of becoming a famous world known rockstar. As played by Mark Wahlberg, the character Chris Cole is the lead singer of a tribute band.Simple concept and interesting idea and eventually somehow he ends up being the lead singer for the band he grew up idolizing.What makes it bizarre is the reason and to how it happened. One day it so happened that Chris had an argument with his tribute band members storming out and vowing to not return, then the following day (or possibly a few days later- it wasn't specified), he receives a phone call from a member of the popular band he idolized.Nothing was shown as to how they got in touch with Chris. It somewhat felt ""too good to be true"" or that it was all a joke- which is what Chris initially intended as well. As it turned out, it wasn't a joke and it was the real thing.The premise of Rock Star reminded somewhat to A Star is Born (2018), but if comparing the two, Rock Star pales a lot in comparison from about every aspect.Ultimately the film does start off strong and engaging then about a little more then halfway becomes repetitive and we start to lose focus. Everything becomes quite predictable, tiresome and full of cliches.In the end, Rock Star is a decent film, and preferably those may enjoy it more so if you are a fan of the music or time period, or have nostalgia.",Rock Star
18,digitalbeachbum,Rock Star Excessive Nature,6,21 July 2013,"This movie is about a guy who makes it big by being able to sing the songs of a big hard rock band, while in a ""cover band"". He is later found via video just like the real life band Journey found Arnel Pineda (except this was long before Arnel).The movie seems to be made up of a collection of real stories which give you a small taste of being in a rock and roll band. At times the movie seems to be disorienting and flat, but it could be deliberate by the director to give the sense of the ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" lifestyle (the highs and lows).Several mini-stories exist within the movie that seem to be pulled from real life (such as blood transfusions for The Rolling Stones guitarist, Keith Richards).There are groupies, drugs, televisions out windows and more. They even took the real life incident of nailing all the furniture in the hotel room to the ceiling (Keith Moon of The Who).The songs are a mix of the 80's and 90's which sort of goes along with the storyline but I think they were limited by licensing. It could have been better given the time period.Over all it was a good movie and the ending was realistic to me. I thought that the main character was played well by Mark Wahlberg.There are some original songs from Dio, Hagar and Blackmore in the sound track. These songs are represented as real songs for Steeldragon, the fictional band in the movie.This isn't a kid movie and it isn't completely family safe, unless you are watching it on regular television.

19,meeza,It rocked but not completely rolled,7,24 March 2002,"`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest.  If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. However, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of Jennifer Aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star.   I did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes. It reminded me of my teenage years where everything `smelled like teen spirit'. I guess the film is worth a viewing, but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some `girls, girls, girls.' *** Average",Rock Star
20,noralee,Charming Retro Tribute to '80's Hair or Metal or Some Sort of Rock Bands,6,19 December 2005,"Watch enough of VH-1's ""Behind the Music"" and you can figure out the plot of ""Rock Star.""I was late so may have missed a philosophical discussion of the difference between a covers band and a tribute band (hmm, that may be worth thinking about for a few minutes). Having missed the '80's in music due to having a life, I did try to figure out if the fictional band was just a hair band, a hard rock band, a light metal band, thrash metal or what, as it's based on Judas Priest which is more metal and alienated than this.But with all those caveats, I was surprised how enjoyable the movie was, and with a fun authentic-sounding soundtrack with folks like Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde in the fictional band (well, to me as a non-expert in whatever light metal rock genre it is with AC/DC, Bon Jovi, etc.).Mark Wahlberg is simply charming through all the hair extensions, much more like his earnest eager to please ""Boogie Nights"" character than his would-be hero in ""Planet of the Apes."" Jennifer Aniston's character is surprisingly more intelligent and secure than her ""Friends"" persona.The groupies here are much less benign than the Muses of ""Almost Famous,"" but then this is a decade later in the travails of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. I don't think I've heard this line from a professional stripper in a VH-1 music movie: ""Hey I need to do you now cause I have to get to my job by midnight.""The production values are very high. The concert authenticity is excellent, as they filmed the scenes as opening acts to genuine metal concerts. The soundtrack is worth dancing around the kitchen and re-living '80's days I never had.

21,triple8,Do you want the gig then?,8,7 March 2004,"What to say about a movie like Rock Star? A lot actually! This is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. It is also a movie I, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. Oh well....I loved this movie-and would see it again and again-but I know that's purely based on my own personal tastes-Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as I think that Rock Star has done. That is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. You will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? As far as setting the atmosphere Rock Star gets a 10 of 10. It also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. It is also the reason why I loved this movie so.But it isn't a great movie. I understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, I'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. The problem with Rock star is the character development.What is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. None. The movie has certain scenes-few and far between but they ARE there-that DO touch on greatness:WARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples- 1)when Izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he takes)2)The first ""after show"" party with Emily(Anniston and Izzy.)3)Backtracking a little-In the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole ""business as usual"" tone sets the stage for what's to come. It's played very effectively.But the problem is, nothing ever does come. There is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. I don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly Anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the ""formula"" feel into true movie depth. Rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. And , though, those scenes I mentioned WERE outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.Another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about ANYTHING. WHY does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of believability. And, frankly the end was just corny. Made no sense and had no reality to it at all.Watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: OK, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. By the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out....I hope I'm not being to hard on Rock Star because I truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. Instead I loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... Although many others loved it to, I suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like I did or some who play. I'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a cliché. I think, one of the problems was the length. I myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.So-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. See it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it WAS life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.",Rock Star
22,Movie-ManDan,"Not Perfect, But Whatever. \m/",8,11 March 2018,"As a metalhead, it makes me so happy to see movies about heavy metal and rock & roll. Metal does not get the amount of praise and respect it deserves. That's something I never understood. These are some of the most talented musicians in the world making music that takes the listener on journey. The best music genre is mixed into a glimpse of life on the road an finding your true self.'Rock Star' is loosely based on the story of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. Judas Priest's Rob Halford wanted to try a solo career and the rest of the band got Owens to fill in for him. Owens was in a Priest tribute band first, similar to Wahlberg's character. He did a couple of albums with them until Halford came back.Mark Wahlberg plays talented singer Chris Cole. He worships Bobby Beers, the frontman of the world's top metal band, Steel Dragon (is that not a badass name or what?) During the daytime, Chris is an IT guy at an office building. By night he is the frontman of a Steel Dragon tribute band called ""Blood Pollution."" Chris takes every little detail of Dragon so seriously to be incorporated into Blood Pollution that they eventually kick him out. He doesn't know where Bobby Beers ends and he begins. Chris soon finds out that Bobby Beers gets booted out of the band and Chris gets the gig as Dragon's new frontman.The beginning of this up until right after Chris' first performance with Steel Dragon is golden. Living life as a wannabe and fulfilling his dream was very relatable. And him becoming Dragon's new lead vocalist was nice as we could totally feel a starstruck Chris. But after Chris' first concert, the movie completely lazes out. When you're a rockstar (and in the world's biggest band), life is full of parties, sex, drugs, and travelling. We see Chris doing all of these and how it effects his longtime girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), but none of these things are done in a very clear and concise way. In the first chunk, we feel exactly what Chris feels. Then we get pulled out of Chris and become just speculators getting little peeks into Chris' time on the road. We can't relate to Chris wanting to find himself and wanting to change like we could in the first half. If the second half of the script was re-written so that it was stronger than the first half (movies need to keep building and move up), the whole movie would be as revered as 'Love & Mercy' and 'The Buddy Holly Story.'Whatever. Since only part of the script is weak and the music is perfect, 'Rock Star' is a great time to have.3/4",Rock Star
23,punishmentpark,Interesting and sympathetic story - dubious movie.,4,27 November 2013,"I had a whole morning to sleep on it, but I'm still not sure what to think of this. First off, it was very weird seeing Dominick West play a 'Judas Priest' guitarist, knowing him thus far only as 'McNulty' - I'll get over it. But somehow the credibility of all the characters ánd the story was practically nil, even if it was based on actual events. Well, 'based on', but the story is presented as a wide range of mostly clichéd and silly incidents built around a half-hearted (romantic) storyline - even if the premise is original, and a few scenes are reasonably impressive (such as the one where 'Izzy' does his first live performance and wins over the crowd), but mostly because of the simple facts, not the filmic value of it.In all honesty, a lot of those clichés are to be expected in a film about '80s (hard)rock music, but this portrayal didn't convince me. The comedy side of it isn't witty enough (while it's desperately trying to be), and any dramatic impact is destroyed by the fragmentary approach that wants to get every rock'n'roll cliché in there. And then the look of it (settings, clothing, photography, etc.) was just dull and uninspired, except for maybe the vast set ups of the big gigs.The music wasn't all that either, in my opinion, and I wish they hadn't put in any pop music at all, which just didn't belong there. The acting is just so so, of which Wahlberg's first part of his job (the young fanatic) was the most convincing. Well, I suppose this was one I just had to see (hardrock / Jennifer Aniston / 'based on a true story involving Judas Priest'). And by the way, did anyone else notice the Anvil reference in the end? Or was I seeing things?Only remotely interesting and entertaining; 4 out of 10.",Rock Star
24,tbills2,Upbeat Turn of the Century Passionate Rock Classic Stars Mark Wahlberg & Jennifer Aniston!,5,3 May 2018,"Unlike Mark's leather-skin pants, not the greatest material, but there's 100% nothing not to love about Rock Star. It rocks and it's really sweet! Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston's sexy chemistry and good looks are delicious for the viewing. Jennifer is so yummy. So yummy. Mark's tasty too. This is a great love story set in a romanticized rock n' roll world that's not all drugs, sex, and rock and roll. This is a really beautiful, lovely movie. Rock Star is a little hokey-dokey, like a lapel jacket, but it makes up for it with its true heartfelt passion for the art, and its ripping rock tunes and wailing rock chords, and for the ultra-beautiful and the ultra-desirable and the ultra-attractive and the ultra-I-love-you Jennifer with sexy Mark. Rock Star's a real nice film to enjoy with your romantic other. Jenny is soo hot in Rock Star, holy rocking balls! She's the hottest rock babe of all-time! She makes me want to stand up and shouuuuuuuuuuuuuut! That see-through fishnet dress Aniston wears with her glittery makeup and her hair down up in a high ponytail with her glistening bangs and starry eyes during the concert and the afterparty where I can see barely Jennifer is wearing a thong but not wearing a bra when Mark's making out with her and that one lusty babe/man dancing in the nightclub is awesomely erotic and cool and almost makes me want to be a rock star as much as it makes me want to be a movie star. It reminds me of a little tamer yet hotter version of that nightclub scene straight out of Basic Instinct with Sharon Stone, what a hot scene this is, thanks for it, Jennifer.

25,TheOtherFool,Boring movie about boring music,2,23 May 2004,"80's sleazy (glam)rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago, so we can laugh at its sillyness. Too bad 'Rock Star' has no laughs at all, as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years.Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he's kicked of the band at the same time the real Steel Dragon singer is kicked of as well, he becomes the next lead singer. You already know how this is gonna end up at that time, with Chris losing it with sex, drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriend/manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston).There's way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost. Watch the (over-rated, but still more fun) Almost Famous instead, or even better, a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions, That Thing You Do.What a stinker. 2/10.",Rock Star
26,Movie-12,"We've seen this all before, but the film still captures an honest and insightful attitude. *** (out of four)",7,12 September 2001,"ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	""Rock Star"" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. We have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script, by ""Crazy/Beautiful"" director John Stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.	""Rock Star,"" originally titled ""Metal God,"" stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris ""Izzy"" Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. His group becomes irritated with Chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.
	This devastates Chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from TV's ""Friends""). He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They have seen Chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. In an instant, Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.
	A true story inspired the ""Rock Star"" concept. An Ohio supply salesman, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, really did replace Rob Halford, the lead singer in Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. 
I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like ""Fear,"" ""Boogie Nights"" ""Three Kings,"" and most recently Tim Burton's lacking remake ""Planet of the Apes."" I am starting to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. ""Rock Star"" is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg truly makes ""Rock Star"" rock. Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care about these characters a great deal. During the film concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also directed ""Holy Man"" and the live action version of ""101 Dalmatians"") creates a gripping atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. At the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. In ""Almost Famous,"" a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. Here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. The filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: ""now audience, the moral of the story is"" We understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. The personal discovery for Chris' must be gradual.Fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. ""Rock Star"" is not a great movie-see ""Almost Famous"" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in his career.",Rock Star

After all, ""Judas Priest"" was one of the most influential Metal bands, having determined what Metal looks and sounds likes, even today. Halford claimed, after twenty years, the music (for him) had stagnated, that he wanted to find a new sound and that he was sick and tired of having to hide his homosexuality (which surprised very few fans, for whom Halfords sexual orientation has always been an unspoken secret). ""Judas Priest"" hired young, aspiring Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an impressive singer in his own rights and lifelong ""Priest""-fan.When ""Rock Star"" arrived at the cinema, many ""Judas Priest"" fans where ecstatic: the movie was rumored to have been based on Tim Owens short-lived career as ""Priest""-singer.Essentially the movie is about every music-lovers dream come true: what would happen if you'd become the singer of your favorite Rock band? Unfortunately, to the clear of mind and reason, the answer would be painfully obvious, even blatant: euphoria and disillusion would go hand in hand, many drug-fueled parties would be followed by many painful hangovers, tour-life would take it's toll on personal relationships, and in the end one question would raise it's ugly head: is it all worth it? The film ""Rock Star"" is as blatant, streamlined and obvious as reality.As to the acting: Mark Wahlberg does a convincing job, despite actually having a Pop / Hip Hop background; Jennifer Aniston plays her role as boring and mediocre as we'd expect from her and Dominic Wests limited range stands in stark contrast to Wahlbergs performance.It doesn't help much that part of ""Steel Dragon"" consists of real musicians (ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham, the son of legendary ""Led Zeppelin""-drummer Jon Bonham). Most musicians (and their fans) come across as the most stereotypical Metalheads since ""Spinal Tap"".Speaking of Metalheads: the Heavy Metal scene is extremely complex, with many sub-categories, ranging from Melodic Metal over NWoBHM, Crossover to Thrash-, Black- and Death Metal, etc. The average Metalhead would identify ""Steel Dragon"" as an arch-typical US-Hair-Metal band, sound and appearance owing more to bands like ""Ratt"" or ""Motley Crue"", rather than a ""True Metal""-band like ""Judas Priest"". Even the name ""Blood Pollution"" would be something adopted by a Death Metal or Grindcore band; but rather unlikely for a band depicted in the film. A little more research would have obviously benefited the picture.Even though it's an enjoyable hour and a half but offers little-to-no fresh revelations or insights into scene, industry or even the musicians themselves. The film will essentially disappoint the average European Metal-fan – especially the fans of ""Judas Priest"". Hence, a mediocre 5 points from 10.",Rock Star

If they'd only spoofed that, we'd have something interesting. Wahlberg repairs 'copy machines' -- that's as close as they get.The 1980s were full of heavy metal preening, but this is not about heavy metal -- this is the Hollywood version of 'heavy metal'.

It was the same thing over and over again (a copy machine), album after album. It seemed the principal audience could never get enough. It was finally supplanted by irresistible force, but that's another story...This narrative is simply a string of TV anecdotes ABOUT the lifestyle, ABOUT the bigger personalities in a weak cosmology, not that OF a cinematic experience.

The plot wasn't that great and didn't make sense; like how can a wannabe lame rock-star become a big star and join a great band overnight? There were barely any funny moments in this movie, so it shouldn't be considered as a comedy. I'm not a rock fan or listen to rock music at all but i felt this movie didn't portray the life of a rock-star accurately and realistically; probably the reason why it was such a box office bomb.

Rock 'n' roll lifestyle isn't for everybody and the main protagonist learns it the hard way. You can have everything you want and will still not be living the life you were born to live.I heard Chris Cole, that's the name of Mark Wahlberg's character, is written with a nod to Blaze Bayley and how he replaced Rob Halford in Judas Priest and the resemblances pretty much stop there (besides their both names starting with the same letter).The movie is filled with music, each frame of it screams ""hard rock"" and I love it but above this music there's also a story, sure it's watered-down and all one-dimensional with caricaturistic characters and shallow meaning behind them but it is pretty damn well made; the performances are not annoying and both Mark and Jennifer Aniston brighten this overall mediocre picture.

Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. His likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the Metal ""goat horn"" hand-sign several times over.The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. More interaction with these life-long Rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's score, the Steel Dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style Metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have!

36,Captain Ed,The clichés will underwhelm you,5,16 August 2002,"Some movies are good, some are bad, and the rest are mediocre.  Rock Star definitely falls into the latter group, buried under unknown-deals-with-fame clichés that are so timeworn you can almost see them unravel.Mark Wahlberg is the lead singer in a 'tribute' band in the mid-80s and Jennifer Aniston is his manager/girlfriend, and both give good performances. Wahlberg is especially good at lip-synching the vocals (provided by another heavy-metal singer, see Trivia).  Aniston is the one character I really gave a damn about; she is so much better in movies than she is in television. She has to get out of Friends.  **Mild SPOILERS**In fact, there really weren't any bad performances, and the production values looked pretty good to me.  The movie's script chokes on all of the clichés: band break-up, hard partying, fame going to the young man's head, girl leaves him because of his infidelity, disillusionment. etc.  Anyone could have written this script in about 20 minutes.  Most laughable to me was the constant reference to Seattle ... I just knew that he would wind up becoming a grunge act (most definitely a suburban version of Kurt Cobain, right down to the sweater!).

38,wayno-6,Thankfully -- NO SPANDEX !!,6,21 March 2002,"The movie ""rock star"" was much better then ""Almost Famous"" (which ""almost"" had an ending.) -- it is definitely a ""period"" (a la 80's) piece.Plot was predictable, but not a nuisance.  if you can stand marky mark acting (mark wahlberg)  its not a bad piece.Its about a wanna-be rock star that makes it to the big time --and all the trappings that go along with making it.  In the end he finds himself -- but the journey is quite interesting.If you loved the music of the 80's == this will certainly bring back some memories - for me it brought back memories of all the Christian wanna be bands I dealt with in the late 80's and early 90's -- some of the memories were down right funny, others painful and insightful.the acting is not stellar, I've seen thicker plots in soup, but the movie had a certain naive' feeling to it, that Wahlberg portrayed well.and it was p.c. too - it DID have a g@y rocker in it. (hehe)This was not a spandex movie, but it had its share of make-up and long hair...thankfully it was more def leppardish in its musical style, rather then poison...overall -- rated 3 reels out of 5 (was a good way to kill an evening with nothing on tv to watch, iow)Wayno",Rock Star

I did long for more detailed characters, but it was still a fun ride.Being in high school in the 80's helped me to really appreciate this movie. There were so many teenagers in the theatre that missed so many of the jokes. People kept staring at me because I was laughing so much.I really liked the ending. I have never thought about how much it made sense to have the over-indulgent 80's give way to the purist early 90's scene. And Mark Wahlberg looks so much better with short hair. :)The credits were hilarious. Especially when that one early 90's song came on that I won't tell you what it was. It was my favorite joke.This movie wasn't about music unfortunately, and that is what I miss. But I think the point was that so much of that 80's glam scene was about something else other than music...7/10",Rock Star
40,Sleeper-Cell,A fun hard rock fairy tale.,9,26 August 2018,"This film seems to cop a lot of flak but I am not sure if it is because people don't get it. This is what the 80's was like, excess and indulgence in spades. A tribute band singer (Wahlberg) is thrown out of his band and gets a call from the band Steel Dragon that he has spent so much admiring. They want him to audition as they have also just sacked their singer. And so Cinderella as it were gets to go to the ball. Madness ensues as he becomes more and more immersed in the hard rock lifestyle. There isn't much to the film but in the end you either enjoy the hard rock music and cliches or you don't. I loved it all. A shame music can't be this much fun anymore.The film also has many 80's rockers playing parts as musicians which makes it even more fun for us fans.",Rock Star

This band would stay unknown.Every cliche in the book in its storyline.Aniston is a decade too old to be believable, and looks it.Marky Mark's wig, stage clothes, and stage moves are something Wilson Phillips and Barry Manilow would find too lame to be rock music.And Marky's attempt at alternative rock at the end is just as forgettable.Every good rock music has a good soundtrack at its core. Did this? NO!Did the awful band get famous from this? No! Steel Dragon were never heard from again.And when your ""metal"" film includes Culture Club, you know it's lame. Even Marky Mark and Aniston contribute some musical atrocities to this piece of junk.So who is this film made for?

I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's performance(all though somewhat similar to his character in 'Boogie Nights').  Jennifer Aniston was better than usual as well.  This was the first movie she was in the I didn't see Rachel Green from 'Friends'.  At least she extended herself past that for a change.  After the half way point however, specifically after Wahlberg's first big concert, the movie goes downhill.  It gets boring and repetitive.  It also tries to speak out against the indulgences of the rock and roll industry, mainly sex, drugs and rock n' roll.  During the last fifty minutes or so only one thought kept popping into my head, and that was that I had seen all of this before.  Not only had I seen it all before, but when I saw if the first time it had many things this movie does not:1.Well defined characters2.A smooth flowing story3.Good direction 4.Absolutely stellar acting5.A great script with excellent dialogueThe first time I saw it, it was called 'Almost Famous'.  This movie is nowhere near as good.  Just watch 'Almost Famous' because its really not worth wasting time on 'Rock Star'.  It started out promisingly, but then it degenerates into a bad bad movie.

It's curious I have enjoyed the film, although I have found the music pretty bad (Too loud and tasteless). Anyway, I guess not all music-related movies can have such good songs like Good Fellas or Almost Famous.Certainly, I wasn't expecting for a fine movie starring Jennifer Aniston, and this has been the exception. To be honest, I thought she had forgotten how to act due to the unjustified pile of money she is getting for playing Rachel in the now-pathetic sitcom Friends.As for Mark Walhberg, I had seen him for the first time in The Yards, a really GREAT thriller. To sum up, Rock Star is a good way to spend one and a half-hours. It's not making it to my Top Ten but it's ok. To me, the weak point is the music.7/10.",Rock Star

Aniston is not as strong but does a credible job of holding her own as Wahlberg's girlfriend. 'Rock Start' works as it gives the viewer a ringside seat of the life of street kid who makes it big then sees the roller coaster ride of fame. The ride is fast and tiresome with many dark corners.

Dominic West (who gave a truly awful performance in ""The Forgotten"") as an obnoxious guitarist is the best thing about this movie, believe it or not. Wahlberg and Aniston both phone in their performances, which flat out stink.Both unbelievable and ridiculous, this movie tries to be nostalgic for the hard-rocking, more innocent times of the 80's, when all people wanted to do was rock and roll.

46,unbend_5440,Music really saves it,6,7 September 2001,"As a huge fan of 80s Hard Rock, I was really looking forward to seeing Rock Star. As the movie started I was more than satisfied. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. The concert scenes made me feel like I was actually there. One major compliment I give this movie is that they made the songs from the fictional band STEEL DRAGON sound realistic for the time period the movie is in. If I didn't know better, I could've been fooled into thinking Steel Dragon was a real band, and all their songs actually were made in the mid 80s. The underdog portion of the story may not be original, but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band, I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year.But at about the halfway point, I was lost. The second half of this movie could've really used a lot of work on the script. I say that the second half of the script needed work, but what I should say is the second half of the movie actually could've used a script, period. The second half is held together by some predictable sequences, all telling the story of a guy indulging in the rock star life, which we've all heard and seen a thousand times. There were very few moments that actually were used to progress the story.But I don't want to give the impression that Rock Star was no good. Although some of the movie didn't work, I still had a blast watching it. The music is what really holds it together. Both the original songs written for the film (Steel Dragon), and the background songs used. It's not often that you can hear bands like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Kiss, and Motley Crue used in a movie. And like I said before, the concert scenes are awesome.So for people who love great 80s Rock, this movie will be a lot of fun. 
Rock Star is an average movie, with an above average soundtrack. Not a perfect film, but it provides enough entertainment for your money.",Rock Star
47,HulkVader,So it had a few clichés...,6,3 March 2002,"Nonetheless, this was a pretty good film. Yes, the garage band (or porn house basement band, in this case) rocker gets his shot at the big time, then falls into the abyss of excess, i.e. the rock star life. But the way he left the band was unforeseen, despite the fore-shadowing of Mats' story of his marriage. And the film then illudes to bigger things for Chris Cole as he ends up in Seattle playing with shorter hair and wearing plaid. Perhaps he rides the wave that bridges 80's hair metal to 90's Seattle scene 'grunge' rock. At any rate, that Chris ends up with Emily makes a big difference in the reconciliation of his personal journey, as if there were another possibility (though Hollywood does occasionally try to throw a curve our way, once a decade or so). I liked this movie, and though he's yet to show real versatility, Wahlberg lends his innate likability to every role he assumes. I also hope that Aniston's continued ventures onto the big screen bring her increased success. She's a rare thing: a beauty with talent.",Rock Star

Mark Wahlberg played the identical role that he had in ""Boogie Nights"" and he played it the same way, nice kid, eager to please, making the audience root for him to succeed. He is pleasing to look at and truly a talented performer, so that was the high point, but other than his performance, there is very little meat in this film and at the end, when we have all gotten our lesson in rock and roll debauchery, we are sent on our way with little return for our buck.  I would say skip this one and go rent ""Boogie Nights"", which is a better film with some outstanding performances.",Rock Star
49,phil-83737,Great Movie & Music,10,17 April 2020,"I first saw this film a good few years ago and wasn't sure I would like it. On seeing it I fell in love with the film and bought the DVD immediately. Call me sad but I've seen it lots and lots since then.
I acknowledge that the script isn't oscar material and that some scenes are predictable but if you like 80's rock then you will love this film.
It follows a young man called Chris (Wahlberg) who is obsessed with his favourite band Steeldragon and models himself on the lead singer Bobby Beers played by Jason Flemyng. He even sings in a tribute band dedicated to Steeldagon managed by his girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. As fate would have it a video of him singing finds its way to the guitarist of Dragon played by Dominic West, Dragon just happen to be looking for a replacement for their lead singer who has issues and they want to replace him.
Cue an interview and Wahlberg hits the big time but is it all he dreamed of?
The film is sprinkled with songs from Ac/Dc, Kiss, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Ted Nugent along with songs performed by the fictional Steel Dragon. The band members include Zac Wilde and Jason Bonham and the band's manager is played by the excellent Timothy Spall who puts in another great performance. Wahlberg and Aniston are also great and yes this film does contain some rock stereotypes but who cares.
It's full of great songs decent acting and the songs carry the film passed any gaps in the script. I love it, it's awesome.",Rock Star
50,noahk,High Entertainment Value Compensates for Plot Problems,7,10 September 2001,"I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed.  I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout.  The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.(2) This is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. INXS' Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC/DC's Are You Ready was from 1990, among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again, not a big deal.Oh, I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive that as well.I could probably nitpick all day, but I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart, if you remember them!).  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays ""Good Vibrations"" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark's face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment",Rock Star
51,oliver-123,Be careful what you wish for - you may get it.,7,23 November 2004,"Have just finished watching this on video, and looked at various comments. It wasn't bad; it wasn't all that good. There were some nice moments - Timothy Spall good, as always, and I liked the bit when the original lead singer Bobby not only admitted he was gay but took off his wig. I think it showed the difference between leading a tribute band and getting to have a fairly ordinary life otherwise, with a loving girlfriend, and living the rock star life for real, constantly on the move, can't go out and just hang around because you'll be mobbed, your girlfriend bored out of her skull because there's nothing for her to do except what she doesn't want to do (be a vacuous stoned rock chick), women constantly hitting on you just to score with a rock star. And in this case, when finally you start wanting to do your own thing, you can't, you have to sing what other people write, just go on doing the same old thing. So Chris Cole grows up a bit and decides what he *really* wants. Okay, so it's a cliché, and I agreed with a reviewer who said he wanted more characterisation, especially on Chris and Emily and their backstory. But it was quite well acted, I thought; good chemistry between Wahlberg and Aniston (let's be honest, she's the reason I watched the film). In many ways, the first part of the film was the best.

He lands the job and goes on tour with his new band and girlfriend. The movie starts out well and Mark Wahlberg does a reasonable job of playing an 80's metal front man but the story just isn't there. He sleeps with a few groupies, has a few beers, and sniffs some drugs but it's also contrived to give a cute little ending where he leaves the band after pulling a guy out of a concert audience who happens to be a better singer than him.

I couldn't imagine who, except Mark Wahlberg fans, the target audience was supposed to be.  Running against the grain of the huge current popularity of modern metal, the film is set 15 years ago when Heart and Bon Jovi rocked the world and features a soundtrack of screaming-guitar poodle-perm AOR.  No genuine Heavy metal or new metal fan is going to enjoy it.  Jennifer Anniston is missing for a huge chunk at the middle, and the romance story is pretty incidental, so there go the girls and the Friends fans.  It's not even that funny, so there's no word of mouth about the laughs or the great set-pieces. Did you even realise this was directed by the same man who gave the world Bill and Ted and Don't Tell Monm the Baby-sitter's Dead?

Aniston is miscast. She's too polished for the girlfriend/manager role, but she's tolerable. Good supporting performances by Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Dagmara Dominczyk, Jason Flemyng, Tim Olyphant and Matthew Glave. The supporting performances are a strength of the movie, along with the music, which is very well done. I'm not a metal fan, but the movie has a handful of very catchy tunes.

I had really high hopes for it. Did it meet my expectations? Unfortunately no.It starts off really well. A kid with lots of talent, whose dream is to be in his favourite band. His cover band gets attention by the his heroes and he is recruited as a replacement for their vocalist. Once in the band, he quickly gains fame and fandom and is loved by many. However, he also discovers the unhealthy ways of rock stars, including lots of partying, alcohol, drugs, random sex etc. His ideas and input are also rejected by the other band members. All this is portrayed quite well and the actors are really good at what they do (except Anniston perhaps, whose character I thought was mostly quite unnecessary and pointless).But the ending does not come together well at all. It's pretty unrealistic and very predictable. I expected it to be something really awesome as most of the movie was quite well thought out. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I think it would've been way better if he quit the band and joined/made a different hard rock/metal band where he could do whatever he wanted and avoid all the negative aspects of a rock star life and thus set a good example for future rock stars. Hey, look! I came up with a better ending already! Seriously, this movie could've been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the stupid ending.Overall, I think this is a movie worth checking out if you like movies about the rock star business.

59,larson.72,Entertaining Crap,5,21 June 2002,"30 minutes into 'Rock Star', you'll feel like you're watching a made for TV movie.  The entire first half hour is so totally unbelievable and cheesy that you will really start to regret that you rented (or bought) this movie. Thankfully, it does get better after that, but not much.  Even after the first half hour, though, the movie does suffer from it's moments of inability to suspend disbelief.  Probably the worst of this, aside from the first 30 minutes, is the end, when Mark Wahlberg's character simply abandons his hair metal band, and next thing we know he's playing 'sensitive' music in an early-90s coffehouse in Seattle and wearing flannel and sweaters.The mere fact that, historically, grunge was a reaction AGAINST 80's hair metal makes this ending completely laughable.  Personally, I was hoping that Jennifer Aniston's character leaving for Seattle halfway through the movie was a foreshadowing of an ending that would've been much more entertaining: Her character joining the late 80's Seattle grunge scene, and then at the end of the movie (presumably circa 1991) during the 'grunge explosion', she becomes rich and famous and Mark Wahlberg ends up crawling back as nothing but a broken has-been. :)",Rock Star

Almost Famous captured a certain charm and naivete amidst the debauchery, Rock Star seems to be solely obsessed with the debauched.

62,julian_abadia,Marky Mark and the Metal Bunch!,4,28 August 2010,"Being a metal head myself (though I like other music genres too)I'm not going to review the production qualities of this movie. No, I'm going to go higher and to speak my mind about the horrible facts who makes this to be one of the worst insults to whatever heavy metal have inspired in its more than 40 years of life.1. The title. If the plot of the film consists in the story of a METAL fan singer, who sings in a METAL band who pays tribute to another METAL band called Steel Dragon, and one day he's giving the opportunity to front the latter band, why on earth have this movie been called ""Rock Star""?. Rock stars are Mick Jagger, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and they are not that metal (at all!). 2. The music. Is Bon Jovi metal?, no. Is INXS metal?, no. Enough said. 3. The lead actress. When you know beforehand, that the movie is going to portrait 80's metal life style, one with even a certain amount of knowledge about that era could foresee that the lead female actress is going to be someone named Doro Pesch (Warlock's singer) or even Lita Ford. Nop, here we have Rachel from that annoying TV sitcom. 4. Steel Dragon. If this movie is based (loosely) on Tim Owens'life, then Steel Dragon is the fictional equivalent of Judas Priest. Mmm, not likely. Though made up of great musicians (Zakk Wylder, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham)Steel Dragon's image and music is nowhere heavier or good as Priest's. I see them as a slighter heavy version of Motley Crue (when they played pop metal). 5. The main protagonist. Marky Mark it's an outsider here. I think Vanilla Ice could have done a better effort. It's like doing a film about the life of Bob Marley, and giving the main role to Adam Sandler (who would suck even if he decides to play himself in a movie about his life). 6. The end. If you think this movie is inconsistent, then don't watch the end. I'll tell you one word: Seattle. Can you make the associations?.In the end, Rock Star is not good or bad. It's not entertaining or depressing. It's just a travesty to the Metal genre, the Metal community, its bands and fans alike.",Rock Star

Still, the story line is interesting ""enough"" and a great sound track makes up for this lightweight story of a heavy metal band member.",Rock Star
67,Jeff-197,The worst part is having to hear those crappy songs,1,16 September 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm going to assume that both A) nobody is serious about wanting to REALLY see this movie, and B) nobody who saw it was expecting it to be another Citizen Kane, so, having said that...It still was horrible.  Mark lays down an emotionless performance. Aniston is no more vibrant than her character on Friends, which isn't that different from the one in the movie, really.  The best actor in the film was the old British manager guy, who wasn't stellar.The worst part of this movie, apart from having to hear way too much of the crappy music (nothing like fake old metal songs performed by some studio artist and lip-sinc-ed by Marky Mark) was that there was only script for the half of it.Here we go - boy likes band, boy tries to be like band, boy loses his band, boy gets to be in his favorite band.  This much we knew... and after this point in the film - the little jokes leave, the vicarious excitement leaves, and the cliches take over.  The film loses any momentum it had, and people start going to the bathroom, getting more popcorn, talking to their dates, etc.  Boy parties too hard, boy loses girl, boy quits band.
Gee, who saw it coming?Had the film been a true biopic, with legal rights as such, it might have been better.  But the ""oh, no, we're definately not talking about Judas Priest"" act is a little lame.  It left me wondering what parts of the film were fact or fiction, if they even interviewed, etc.  And the effect was lost -- songs ""performed"" were (as far as I could tell) fake, not authentic rock songs, outfits were cheezy and lame (Dragons?  They came up with Dragons??  Who wears a dragon?), and the viewers couldn't get into the falseness of it.  It was as if they started making the movie using Judas Priest's name, songs, and look... then got sued, and had to whitewash it... leaving nothing much behind.  That was my take on it.  It just felt... awkward.A more interesting story may have been the heartbreak and tribulations of the ""kicked-out-largely-for-coming-out"" lead singer.But instead we get this tired old story that quits halfway through the picture.",Rock Star
68,electronicparty,Great Music,7,30 August 2004,"I was just a kid in the 80's but I remember the big hair and arena rock. I'd set up stages made from plywood and cement blocks and play my broom in the back yard. The days of Def Leppard, Dokken, Motley Crue, White Snake, and arena rock maybe over, however Rock Star captures those days. It has some solid arena rock hits preformed by Steel Dragon called ""Stand Up"" and a great ballad ""We all Die Young"". This movie is entertaining to watch and I really thought the ending was great. It's just the kind of movie you can watch more then once and still enjoy. This is a movie for every fan who's dared to dream to be a rock stars.

70,poisonrock29,"Quite good, need to see again.",5,23 November 2003,"I live for 80's Hard Rock music and that's why i wanted to see this movie (and because Jennifer Aniston is in it).  I can remember when 80's Hard Rock was everywhere and i thought it would never die but unfortunately it did when the new Hip Hop sound came out.  Even at the end of Rock Star as the credits were rolling, Mark Wahlberg basically said Metal was out and Hip Hop was in, that's what happened in 1991 at the MTv music awards when the leaders of 80's Hard Rock, Poison, gave a memorable and very bad performance (due to the lead guitarist doing a solo in the middle of a song which caused an embarrasing situation and the song had to be started over again) which led to the end of this feel good music but that's another story (i'm trying not to ramble too much).  Rock Star was an okay movie which i feel i need to watch a second time to enjoy more.  It's shows the lifestyle of a Rock Star very well, not just the good points, but Rock Star points out all the downsides to being a Rock Star too, all the things we hear about have been put into film for our entertainment.  It's a fast moving movie which manages to hold your interest if your into this style of music, there is quite a bit of comedy too which is also worth mentioning to it's credit.  It's very obvious that Mark Wahlberg was miming when he was singing, the real voice was by Michael Matijevic of the band STEELHEART, and also some of it was by Mark Slaughter of SLAUGHTER, two of the best 80's Hard Rock bands.  You can tell Michael Matijevic's voice anywhere as it's so loud and piercing his voice can blow up your CD player if your not careful.  Rock tar is worth watching just for the music, anyone who remembers 80's Hard Rock will have their memories flowing back after watching this with a soundtrack from BON JOVI, DAVID LEE ROTH and AC'DC among others.  It would have been nice if some of the old Rock stars from the 80's were given guest appearances, especially Bret Michaels of Poison since he was so influential to the success of Hair Metal and he has an acting background too.",Rock Star
71,RawkStah,"Decent date movie, nothing more.",5,6 September 2001,"Briefly, Rock Star is a fairy tale. It's not really about rock and roll. It's about a male Cinderella (a Cinderfella, if you will, and if you don't mind a Jerry Lewis reference) who, instead of marrying a prince, marries a rock band... but at what cost?This movie has several hurdles to clear -- This Is Spinal Tap, Wayne's World 2, and ""VH1's Behind The Music"". The audience already knows what happens in a rock and roll band. Thankfully, the movie isn't out to top anything or be a cautionary tale. It's just there to entertain.If you've seen any trailers for this movie, you'll know what the story is: Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a Steel Dragons tribute (NOT cover) band called Blood Pollution. When the lead singer for SD is fired, Cole is recruited to join as the new lead singer. Begin rise of fame. During his career with SD, his relationship with his girlfriend/manager Emily (Aniston) is strained. Will things work out? Will Steel Dragons be able to keep fans with a new lead singer? WILL HAIR METAL SURVIVE? All of these questions will be answered in the movie, if not here.Although the movie is based around a fictional band, certain activities didn't need to be made up. Just as Hannibal Lecter is a combination of several serial killers, Steel Dragons is based on several metal bands. Nods are given to Judas Priest, Black Flag, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Guns 'n' Roses, Van Halen, and probably a host of others I can't think of right now. Adding to Rock Star's r&r credibilty is the casting of Zakk Wylde (one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists) and Jason Bonham (a drummer, and son of late Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham). So, the music is going to be of high quality, regardless of your feelings towards hair metal as a genre.
The movie is set in the mid-1980s, when post-glam hair metal was making big strides in top-40 music. This distinction is very important. Steel Dragons is not Twisted Sister or Motley Crue or Judas Priest or Metallica. It's more in the vein of Def Leppard or Winger or Bon Jovi. Girls will like this band. Cole (who is known to the public as Izzy) will not scare girls like Lemmy from Motorhead. The time that the movie is doubly important in that it happens before hair metal becomes a parody of itself, and, even more importantly, before the dread beast from the Northwest emerges from Seattle. It happens during the glory days of hair metal. Power ballads? Absolutely. Guitarists moving in unison? You bet. Tight leather pants? Oh, yeah. Once upon a time, this was actually cool, and not campy or homoerotic. Well, in retrospect, it was always homoerotic, but girls still liked it. And, that's what rock and roll is all about.However, it's not what the movie is about -- it is about, to steal the tagline, ""a wannabe who got to be"". Here's where the movie tends to disappoint. The cast was incredibly talented, but the characters are fairly one-dimensional. Which is not to say that the performances were bad -- some of the scenes were incredibly passionate, but I would have liked to have seen more character in the characters. Chris Cole is, to put it bluntly, a geek. He knows things about Steel Dragons that would put a Trekkie who sleeps in his Spock ears and could write a 20-page dissertation on why Kirk is a far better captain than Picard to shame. Details about the color of the thread in costumes, what year and tour a particular outfit was worn, not to mention lyrics and choreography. This kid is devoted to his dream. Emily has a head for business, and is devoted to Chris. I really would have liked to have seen more backstory between these two characters. As they were written, however, I felt just a little bit left out. The character of Miggs (Spall) however, was just about perfect. He is THE roadie. Not the god-of-all-roadies that we saw in Wayne's World 2, but just a guy who can get the job done. And, of course, as this is a fairy tale, he is as close as we come to a fairy godmother.If you're looking for a good character study within an industry, watch Boogie Nights. If you're looking for a date movie, Rock Star is probably better. And less awkward.",Rock Star

A word of explanation: I went to Hasting's to take an unrelated movie back, which was really scratched, explained that some scenes didn't even play, and they gave me a rain check for a free rental, and I came across Rock Star.Mark Whalburg plays a lead singer of a cover (or a ""tribute"") band and gets the chance of a lifetime when he's called forth to replace the lead singer in the band that he idolizes. Not much to it, really...it kind of speeds through the whole story, which is a good thing. If it got bogged down in the whole clichés of rock-and-roll, it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable.Acting was pretty much solid, nothing too much to complain about.

73,Spotnick,Bring back the 80s!,7,23 September 2001,"Actually, this is not a bad movie.But the problem with this kind of movie is, that it won't interest people other than those who grew up in the 80s. Yes, the story is cliché, no wonder about that, but it could have happened today (after all, all boys band are wannabe who got hired to play the dummy and sing for a manager), but since it's located in the 80s with rock bands (do people really classify this as metal? Hard Rock ok, but metal? please..)But, just like the movie ""The Wedding Singer"", you get in this movie and you suddenly miss the 80s, and how fun it was back then.So, don't go see this movie if you want a serious movie, go to this movie if you wish to be entertained and have a bit of nostalgia.As for the acting, I like Mark Whalberg, and it's an interesting choice of actor, because he's actually, well, you know, the brother of Danny Wahlberg of NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK, which is one of the ""boys band"" of the 90s who was a manager creation, so maybe he got input from his brother... but we all know Mark Whalberg is a former hip-hop artist, I guess it's the only kind of music he can sings, if they didn't use his vocals on this movie... then maybe I'm wrong, but I sure know on the soundtrack it's not him!As for the music itself, it's really up to the level of those hair bands in the 80s, you can seriously swap those songs with Bon Jovi or Motley Crue and it would do. I must say that's it's almost a shame they put that ""metal"" chorus on ""We All Die Young"", because that song is radio hit potential.As for comparing this movie to Almost Famous, well, maybe it's another rock band, but no, this one is a best entertainment than Almost Famous, but Almost Famous is more original and more ""serious"".",Rock Star
74,mgreene-2,A period piece - for fans of the music genre only,6,19 March 2002,"If you are a twenty or thirtysomething who can appreciate Motley Crew, Poison, or any other 80s glam metal band than this movie is for you. Rock Star is a period piece examining the life and times of one cheese metal band, Steel Dragon and their new front man Chris ""Izzy don't call me Marky"" Cole. Rock Star succeeds where Almost Famous doesn't, in that it accurately (for the most part) depicts and portrays the nostalgia of the time, the music, and most of all, the fans. Rock Star encompasses a solid fundamental core of film traits that aid in establishing it as a worthy video rental. The plot is predictable yet believable, the acting is above average, the set design is fairly accurate, and the pacing of the movie is fast enough to keep the viewer involved as well as entertained. Most important, the movie does not take itself too seriously. During the end credits ""Good Vibrations"" is played which I felt was humorous and refreshing, as well as an accurate portal of the transition period of the early 90s between glam metal and Seattle grunge.  However, the movie is not without its fair share of technical glitches and the cinematography is not subtle - it's more like a Def Leppard video. If you are a fan of the music and grew up in the 80s you might enjoy this one. Otherwise, if you are going to be overtly cynical or generally have contempt for the glam metal counterculture you might want to stick to VH-1 Behind the Music and save yourself the $4 rental fee. I can appreciate the music so I gave this flick a well earned 6/10 - mostly for its technical accuracies of the music, culture, and the time period.",Rock Star

I was ready for a movie that tells the story from the arena rock as to the band starting out in the basement dreaming of glory. (First of all I have to state that I sang in a tribute band for over 7 years and you really want to copy the band you are doing well maybe sometimes it overtakes you). The first part of the film is top notch. The live performances are great. From what I read the scenes on stage were shot between bands at a real concert(I can,t remember what bands they were).But what I really wanted to see was the business side of the story you never see him sign any contract, you never find out if he is made a partner in the group or is just payed a salary like a hired gun, and what did he have in finances in the end. The second half of the film is pretty predictable but the end really had me scratching my head. What singer would walk away from one one the biggest groups in the world? Just because they would not let him write songs for the group? I personally think the end would have been better if he would have died in the end (which is what I thought was going to happen (I guess to cliché). Or better the old singer comes back (IRON MAIDEN and JUDAS PRIEST fans anyone?)Let me just say for the most part I enjoyed the film but I was disappointed when the video release had no deleted scenes (I am sure there were some)",Rock Star
76,johnhenrik,What's up?,5,17 February 2009,"OK movie, but come on. Where's the mirrors and the blades, the white nostrils? Without it, the band & their entourage would be passed out & sleeping on the floor a lot of the time, that is, when they aren't onstage, backstage, or talking with their managers, crew members, fans, etc. Also, the floor would often be in a bus, a van, a delivery truck, or in somebody else's motor home in a parking lot on the way to, or at the next stadium or theater or wherever the gig is. I think the hint that Steel Dragon's PR lady, ""Tania Asher"", is probably a tranny, is a funny part of the entertainment industry. It is not at all uncommon, at least on the west coast & in NYC. But, please Hollywood! You've got plenty of real tranny actor's, actress's, or whatever you want to call them ready for work everyday. I have known several of them, all XY transforming to XX. You can find them all over LA. They are bartenders, waitresses, ""T-women of the night"". Many of them are incredibly talented & some of those females, uh... males, are, hummm; you would never have known! I looked up that actress, Dagmara Dominczyk, & she really is a woman. If you wanted to touch the real world a little more, there were quite a few already established performers. Why couldn't you make offers to Jahna Steele, Vaniity, or an intersex actress like Eva Robin's? Eva & other ones you could have hired might need a dubbed over voice, but what's the biggie? You could have also looked for some tranny singers to add some spice to your ""Hair-Band"" theme. I'm not sure about when this movie was made, but now you could get people like Harisu. And, let me tell all you overly MACHO Heteros out there, Harisu could scare you. Was your pretty girlfriend born female? ""Rock Star"" showed a condensed version of the rock world of the 80's, but it was quite sanitized & Hollywoodized.

Afterall, Rock Star offered me everything the Musketeer didn't; entertainment. Mark Wahlberg's follow up to Planet of the Apes comes in the form of Rock Star, a story of self discovery set in the 80's world of drugs, sex and rock & roll. Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, the front man for a band dedicated to covering his favorite band ""Steel Dragon"".  Cole repeatedly refers to his band as a ""tribute"" band, and spends all of his time matching the looks and sounds of Steel Dragon.  Eventually all of his work pays off, as the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the group, and they are suddenly in need of a new front man.  That is where Chris Cole comes in.  Renamed Izzy, Cole steps in as the new lead for the real Steel Dragon. The movie goes on, and Cole is forced to choose between making his own music or making Steel Dragon music. He's also faced with the decision to be with a woman who loves him (Jennifer Aniston), or having a new girl in his hotel every night.  In the end I don't need to tell you which choices he makes. While Rock Star is a fairly predictable movie, it is also very enjoyable.  There were moments that felt like Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"", but you are never drawn deep enough into these characters to achieve the excellence of that movie.  I also could have done without the nudity.  I suppose it served it's purpose, but it somehow seemed out of place in a movie with this much heart.  That being said, I laughed, and when the scene was set, I got a little emotional. Mark Wahlberg shows us all of the heart and feeling that he held back in ""Planet of the Apes"".  He is a subtle actor, but he is very effective in this, as we see his battle to become his own man. Jennifer Aniston has star quality written all over her.  If only she would let someone else choose the movies that she gets involved in.  This is the first movie I can remember her in, that didn't suck.  ""She's the One"" and ""Picture Perfect"" were not exactly star vehicles.  In this movie we see the gifts that she has.  She's like Julia Roberts in that when she starts to cry, you can't help but get welled up.  Guys, you know what I'm talking about!!!  She's beautiful, and you can't help but cheer for her to be treated right. Finally, I'm looking forward to picking up the soundtrack to this movie. For any youth of the 80's, there will be instant flashbacks to bands like Motley Crue, Poison and Warrant.  Oh, those were good days.  You haven't heard music until you've heard it from 5 guys with long hair and eyeliner. Steel Dragon had some strong tunes, I just wish that they had been a real band when I was growing up.  The final song done by Chris Cole is also fantastic and worth the price of admission. This was a really enjoyable movie, just don't expect to carry it with you like ""Almost Famous"".

Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this, I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston.

This Is A Must Have For Anybody Who Lived Through The 80's or If You Are Like Me, Still Lives In The 80's. All In All Great Flick and Even If You Did'nt Care For 80's Hard Rock. It Worth Seeing At Least Once. This Is My Favorite Movie Of All Time!",Rock Star
93,mpskye2001,Did anyone really like this movie,1,1 August 2003,"Well, what is there to say about this movie. I just recently had the displeasure of seeing it on cable and am thanking god I did not pay ten dollars or else I would have been quite annoyed. Let's break it down. You take two really talentless actors, one who was a member of the funky bunch and one is one of the most annoying t.v. shows on the small screen, add in some really bad musicians from the 80's and you get what is this poor excuse for a movie. The premise was horrible and the acting was even worse. As if people had not suffered through the hard rock movement in the 80's enough, we have to endure it through third-rate story-telling on the big screen. All I will say is my condolenses on the people who got ripped off when they spent their hard-earned money to see this terrible movie with really bad acting. I would have asked for my money back as I ran screaming from the theater, but that is just my unqualified opinion.",Rock Star
94,stevec-48,Not great but surprisingly good,6,9 February 2007,"This is a bit of a Cinderella story about a wannabe rock star who makes the grade and subsequently brings his girlfriend/manager (Aniston) into the world of the whole rock scene with him. The deeper he gets into it the more troubled their relationship becomes and after a while even the good times don't seem so good to him.I suppose it is a little contrived and the second half doesn't have the freshness and ""what will happen next"" anticipation of the first part but nevertheless it's a decent watch. This was the first role I'd seen Jennifer Aniston in other than as Rachel in ""Friends"" and it opened my eyes to the fact that she really is a very good actress. I've seen her in other films since such as ""The Good Girl"" and she is definitely far more than just a pretty face.",Rock Star

Its not worth wasting any more time typing about this movie because I've already lost over an hour and a half of my life thinking how I should really be getting out more instead of fascinating about the roof collapsing taking this horribly awful movie with it.",Rock Star
97,jauniaux,"Wow, Interesting to see what it's really like.....",10,10 July 2006,"I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You won't waste your popcorn on this one. Semi-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. There's some laughs thrown in too.",Rock Star
98,rodneyho,"Goes down as easy as a Bon Jovi song, with as much depth",6,6 September 2001,"This film, set in 1985 or so, captures the hair band rock scene with accuracy (though inexplicably, they play the 1987 INXS hit ""Devil Inside"" at a party.) The pacing and camera work are solid. Mark Wahlberg, having been a pop star, does an admirable job imitating a tribute band singer who becomes the actual band's singer. Jennifer Aniston does her ""Friends"" character but isn't given much to do in the end. The major problem with the movie is not much happens and events just sort of happen. There's not a lot of major character development, dramatic high points or incredibly funny ""Spinal Tap"" moments either. It's frequently mildly amusing, which is usually a sign that you should probably rent this when the better films come out.",Rock Star

100,Metalsquirrel,Rock Star promises much but stumbles (Warning!!! Contains Spoilers),5,13 August 2002,"When I heard that a film was in the works based on the real life search for the replacement of former Judas Priest singer Rob Halford I was intrigued. After months of Internet hype, I was genuinely excited. After seeing the movie, however, I was left wanting.(Warning!!! Spoilers Ahead)Truth be told, there were aspects of this film that I enjoyed. For one, the original music written for Rock Star is excellent. Moreover, the previously released music supplied by Motley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and Ted Nugent rocks as well. However, therein lies one of the major drawbacks of this film-when the final credits rolled, I had an incredible urge to buy the soundtrack; not to see this movie again.I did not rush out to see this movie again because I felt that I had been cheated story wise. The non-fictional events took place this way: A man works hard by day and at night, works even harder fronting a Judas Priest cover band. This cover band could have easily given in and started playing grunge or alternative music to please more people. However, they stick to the music that they love and one of them gets the opportunity to front the band that they all revere. When given this opportunity, Tim `Ripper' Owens, seizes it with both hands and to this day, is still the lead singer for Judas Priest. Seems made for Hollywood, right? A classic tale of holding on to your dreams, working hard, and taking advantage of the opportunity when (and most importantly, if) it knocks.Something happened when the cameras started rolling though. What Rock Star became was a story of a man who gets an opportunity to fulfill his dreams but throws it all away because he mistreated his girlfriend. Moreover, he cuts his hair and starts an alternative band!!! I understand that Hollywood has to make a movie accessible to the public but turning a film that should have been about a love for a form of music into a trite `boy cheats on girl, boy loses girl, boy gives up everything to get girl back' love story is too much!I know that some people may not understand that true metal musicians would find it hard to swallow this picture. I also understand that the audience that will find this film appealing are the people that are fans of Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. Unfortunately, sticking to the original story that got George Clooney interested in this project would have made a better film. If you are looking for a date flick disguised as an ode to 80's metal then Rock Star is for you. However, you are not going to be satisfied if you think that Rock Star is the movie that finally chronicles the hard rocking 80's.",Rock Star
101,MetalFan1970,this movie rocks,9,8 September 2001,"Rockstar is the movie what the heavy metal music world has been waiting for. the main people in this movie were awesome. now i know some of you know who mark wahlberg is maybe some of you heard of marky mark, well he proves that he can also rock n roll with the best of them. the movie is based on the life story of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, the current singer of judas priest. so in a nutshell go see rockstar",Rock Star
102,spcneundorf,Tim Ripper Owens is from Akron,8,3 September 2013,"This movie is a classic from the beginning of Mark Wahlberg's career. His roll here is great and the Steel Dragon music is definitely enjoyable. Jennifer Aniston is both sexy and strong. Wahlberg's character feels the ups and downs of the hair metal rock industry and returns to where he starts. Rock Star hits the mark with the story and music. Anyone who grew up in the 80s listening to the music of Malmsteen, Priest, Slaughter, etc... will love it. The story based loosely on the life of Akron's own Tim Ripper Owens. He's a great guy and owns a sports bar/concert club here in the Akron area called Rippers Rock House. If your in the area stop by. Ripper is there frequently and plays solo or with local bands as well.",Rock Star
103,cliffo88,Disappointing in the end,4,2 June 2008,"As a Heavy Metal fan I was keen to see this film, even though I had a few doubts going in. However those doubts were soon put to bed as the film progressed. The first half was very enjoyable for a fan of the music. A great sound track and the songs of Steel Dragon had a good 80s rock vibe about them.The first hour of the film basically takes the story of what happened to Judas Priest in the early 90s: they're singer leaves and they hire a new singer who was previously in a Judas Priest tribute band. However come the second half of the film they really mess things up with the plot. We are somehow supposed to believe that Mark Walhberg's character is obsessed with Steel Dragon and actually singing for them is the ultimate dream come true but then when he actually achieves this dream he is just gonna walk out on it so he can be with his girlfriend who doesn't even support his dream and suddenly get over the band.I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it. To me it basically said that Heavy Metal is just a phase that you'll one day grow out of. Well any true fan will tell you that this music stays with you for life. To me this movie was not written for fans of the genre because they totally copped out on the ending.However, I was pleasantly surprised with Mark Walhberg. I still think he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood today, but I thought he handled the role very well. Also, as I said before, the soundtrack was also cool. It was also great to see Steel Dragon made up of actual musicians: Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black label Society), Jeff Pilson (Dokken)and Jason Bonham (son of late Led Zepplin drummer John Bonham).A film of two halves so I'm gonna give 5/10 a wasted a potentially good film messed up by ridiculous plot holes.",Rock Star

It is more of the same predictable, formula drivel that seems to drive the motion picture industry. It offered no new insight into the behind the scenes world of rock and roll: the emphasis on money, the stifling of creativity, and the excesses of temptation turn the artist into a product. Is this news to anyone? Sad to say, the same is true of the movie industry, as is plainly exhibited by this film. Mark Wahlberg reprises his Dirk Diggler role from ""Boogie Nights"" and Jennifer Aniston continues to play Rachel from ""Friends,"" as she seems to do in every role she takes. Everything in this movie, from the script to the acting to the directing, lacks imagination and creativity.",Rock Star
106,bottleneck911,wow does this suck,2,7 September 2001,For the love of god don't waste your money on this movie.  It's complete crap.   The movie is supposed to glorify heavy metal but turns around and stabs it in the back at the end .  The music is pretty good especially when you have people like Sammy Hagar writing the music.  But Mark is completely miscast (just like Planet of the Apes).  The producers of this movie cut Judas Priest out of the picture so inspired by is an Accurate heading.

There was nothing that happened in this movie that any non-moron could have seen coming more than 10 minutes before it occured.

It's a typical rock movie with no real surprises, but it manages to hold your attention with decent acting (even Jennifer Aniston which REALLY surprised me) and (for the most part) GREAT music.  There are a few musical selections which leave me scratching my head.  Most notably would be the INXS song.  Anyone into 80s metal wouldn't have been caught DEAD listening to this!!!!!  (Take my word for I'm a hair metal headbanger!).  The costumer designer obviously didn't live in the 80s era either as far as Jennifer A. was concerned!!!!!!

IT TOOK PLACE IN THE 80s. they explained the story so well about normal life in the rock star position. the advantages of drugs and alcohol and the disadvantages of family members. 10 out of 10.

I've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!Overall, the movie is very entertaining, provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do I find boring! It was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. I was happy to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, they all delivered solid performances. I tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, specially in the terms of the script.That could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. One thing that did bother me a bit was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought she wasn't the right person for this role,I just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend.But as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. To summarize, a good and a funny movie, that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!",Rock Star

The band that seems to have a lot of skills, but no goals, besides to tribute Izzy's favorite band ""Steel Dragon"". He has amazing vocal talent, but for some unknown reason his only motivation as a musician is ""Steel Dragon"", and believes he isn't capable of doing his own material. A miracle graces Izzy's life as he takes over the lead vocalist in his ideal band ""Steel Dragon""...Izzy's girlfriend/ manager in this film (Jenifer Aniston) comes along to follow her boyfriend in the outrageous and scandalous life style of a rock star. Things were going smoothly for Izzy and this movie, as Izzy is living his dream rocking out with ""Steel Dragon"", with millions of fans now idolizing him ironically as he once idolized the same band a few short years earlier. The movie is now a little over an hour in running time, what will be the conflict for the remaining part of this film? Surprise surprise, Jenifer Aniston (Izzy's girlfriend)decides she isn't cut for her job as Izzy's manager no longer, which also indicates her thoughts on her and Izzy's future. I found the whole second part of this movie predictable and stale. Izzy's girlfriend quits and returns home. Izzy at that time was having the time of his life, his dream became reality, now with his girlfriends departure he decides the Rock and Roll life wasn't meant for him after all, so he returns to his girlfriend and blah blah blah!! I saw the second half of this film coming a mile away, its done so excessively in the average B- movies...Now I ask this question to anyone who reads this if you had your dream handed to you like Izzy did, would you run with it...Or throw it away for any selfish and jealous woman (and beautiful of course) like he did? Their are millions of fish in the sea...Izzy only had one shot at his dream, and he gave it up. Not smart.All in all this movie DID show promise and I particularly enjoyed the first half. I can relate to Whalberg's character because I am too a man with a dream. I just wish the movie would have focused on the dream for once rather then ""boy meets girl"",""boy falls in love with girl"" ,or maybe Hollywood should start showing the world some realistic endings after all for every single marriage there is a divorce. If the film could have steered in the opposite direction in its second half then it would have been much more enjoyable. My opinion of the movie is almost like the movie itself. It shows hope and ambition to be a memorable film as Izzy shows to be the lead singer of ""Steel Dragon"", but in the end the movie sells out and becomes forgettable and ordinary, as Izzy retires from his dream to pursue the so called ""love of his life"".

It was funny, interesting, and didn't make the 80's look as cheesy as I remember them, but Mark Wahlberg looked like he was in hell throughout the movie. There are genuinely only a couple of scenes where I can remember seeing him smile and this is about a guy who gets to live out his dream of being in a gigantic rock band!The reason he didn't smile much is probably because of the whole meaning behind the story though. From almost the beginning, it's like the whole idea of Rock Star is to talk about the evil of the music industry and how people treat each other and by about 3/4 of the way in, you feel like it's being slammed over your head.That whole morale gets old real fast and much of the comedy and pleasure in the film is quickly swept away before you can even laugh again. Although I'm sure it's true and all that, Almost Famous is a much better example of what movies about the music industry should be like.",Rock Star

Clocking in at almost 2 hours long, I was glad when it was over because I thought I was going to hurt myself from laughing so hard.  The laughter came from the campiness of the film, not out of sarcasm.  This film doesn't take itself seriously, which is it's saving grace.  If you were active into movies and music in the 80's, you will appreciate what I think this movie is trying to get across which is nostalgia with humor and music. From the lead actors obsessive compulsive fascination with the band and lead singer of the group which he has formed a 'tribute band' for (which everyone else calls a cover band much to his dismay) to the movies' rock opera-ish metal songs with the 'rock chix' that flared back in the 80's to the films soundtrack featuring Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Talking Heads, Def Leppard, and other of your shameful dusty favorites (you've sung them at karaoke night in the pub..admit it).  I laughed so hard at the pseudo-serious drama that I thought I would hurt myself at times.  A little long, but a fun film for nostalgia sake.",Rock Star

But it is quite enjoyable.  If you have ever had dreams of being on stage and grew up with 80's music, you will enjoy it (but go in expecting bubble gum!).We just saw a 'Behind the Music' on Judas Priest -- it is clear that Rock Star follows closely their front-man switch in the 1990's.  Not sure that is mentioned anywhere.",Rock Star
117,lonegunwoman,"Good movie, Great music!",9,5 September 2001,"I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him, but also make you really care about his character.Jennifer Aniston, who hasn't impressed me in movies up to this point, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend/manager. She shows more real emotion than I've seen in her last few movies combined.But above all, it's the music in this movie that really draws you in. Peppered with some 80's tunes (let's face it - Bon Jovi would have any 80's music fans rocking in their seat), the movie really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's performance of them.

It was the best drama type movie I had ever seen. I found a lot of the special features and other things on this DVD very interesting. Especially the theatrical trailer. Watching this movie makes me think about all the things I wish I could have done in life that I never really got to do. Whether it be because I didn't have any or enough money, or because I just didn't know how to get it started.

120,jbirdnc,Pain For Pleasure!!!!!!!,10,9 September 2001,"Once again Mark Walberg does what few actors I think out there do. He makes his performances so convincing. Going into this film I didn't really know what to expect. One side of me said this was branded from the start to be cheesy and garbage. The other side of me said give this film a chance, afterall it's about heavy metal music. I think people who are involved in music like play in bands will really relate to this film. From beginning to end, I felt like although the plot was kinda far fetched, it could STILL happen. Just like in Boogie Nights, you get caught up in Chris' world. From the 80's soundtrack, to the wack ass hairstyles. Everything that IS the 80's is on display. I think one of the highlights of the film is when Walberg is trying to ""perfect"" his British accent. Having real metal heads like Zakk Wilde in it was cool too. Kinda like the real porn stars sprinkled in Boogie Nights. The lead singer of Third Eye Blind (Steven Jenkins) plays quite a surprising role in the film also. I've never been a Jennifer Aniston fan, but she also does a killer job of acting as Walberg's girlfriend. Throughout the film you develop a bond with both Walberg and Aniston, which shows the film has great charactor developement. You really want good things to happen for them. The scene where Walberg is trying out for Steel Dragon, made me nervous. Like Walberg was my little brother trying out for the big band. Now, alot of critics and others will probably trash this film, but I think the target audience are the 20 somethings. Will teens like it? Not sure, they can't relate to the mid 80's, wasn't their time. Overall, I'd like to see this film get some type of award. It was the best movie I've seen all year, next to American Pie 2. The definate late summer sleeper. Rock Star is definately worth seeing again, and stick aroud to the ending credits. Their pretty funny. This is definately one awesome ass flick.

This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a *ROCK STAR* Yeah I said it. Everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot light( Weather said or not). This movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy.

My friends and I, all 80s hair metal fans, saw it in the theater and LOVED IT. Sure, there are issues with some of the background music being out of time, which can be annoying, but the awesome Steel Dragon tunes more than make up for that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it has a light, fun tone. The soundtrack rocks, and the original Steel Dragon songs are amazing! I frequently find myself singing them at random times. The writing is pretty good, there are several classic lines that crack me up every time. The casting is great, mixing perfectly suited actors and real musicians. This movie will definitely become a cult classic, and when that time rolls around, Jennifer Aniston and Mark Wahlberg will be proud to have it listed on their resumes.

126,hrpr99,Clichéd but highly watchable,7,1 January 2005,"Look, if you come across a rock movie and particularly a fictional rock movie you really do know what to expect and on that level this film does not disappoint. Without seeing it I could have approximately predicted the storyline and no doubt you could too. The rock stars life style unpredictably stylised, the love interest threaded through the heart of the film, the body surfing, the rock star language - its all there in bucket loads. Having said all that, this is a highly watchable film in no small amount due to the performances of Jennifer Anniston and Mark Wahlberg. Both these actors have a screen presence that holds your gaze. Don't expect too much from this film and you'll enjoy the ride - give it a go.",Rock Star
127,Ryanandpeta,Quite Possibly the Greatest Movie Ever Made!,9,12 January 2005,"I first saw this movie back in 2002 and fell in love with it. I agree it was never going to win any awards and the music is cheesy but does anyone remember the 80's? Come on now, the music was horrible! I think it was accurate on that point and I even have downloaded most of the soundtrack of 'Steel Dragon'! Mark Walberg was great as Chris ""Izzy"" Coles and the rest of the band was equally awesome to watch. I also think this movie teaches some very valuable lessons about life. Never sell out your friends cause you never know when they might land a great gig with a world famous band. Don't take your lady for granted cause she might take off and start a coffee house in Seattle. Lastly, don't take drugs because you quite possibly could end up at an all-night orgy party and sleep with a she-male. So all of who want to, join me and ""STAND UP AND SHOUT""! Cause ""WE ALL DIE YOUNG""!",Rock Star
128,SMCProductionsLLC,Interesting Judas Priest 'insights'!,7,12 April 2006,"This movie was originally supposed to be about Judas Priest and Ripper Owens' climb to be lead singer. The various lawyers got involved, and all the direct references were deleted, but although, 'The names have been changed...' this movie is still about that!I think it's interesting seeing some of the inner workings of Judas Priest, and if you are a fan of the band, or even of the genre, you will enjoy it. Of course, it's NOT perfect, it's the 'Hollywood' version of metal and Rock and Roll lifestyle.......rent it, buy it, get a few cold ones out of the fridge, and pop it in the player...enjoy!",Rock Star
129,SunChilde,Great Idea....Badly Done,5,7 January 2006,"This movie had the potential to be great. It started out with an interesting idea: small town guy worships famous band then gets the chance to perform for thousands as a member of the band he worships.The problem is that the great idea was badly handled with an inept script. I enjoyed the music, but the story left a lot to be desired. Wahlberg did okay in his part, particularly in the concert scenes. But I felt that Jennifer Anniston was all wrong for this film. I totally did not believe that she would fall for a guy as goofy as Chris/Izzy. He reminded me of a big, dumb puppy.Also, the emphasis on the ""rockin'"" parents and the scenes of the mom's home daycare center made the movie seem too cute and cuddly...cute and cuddly do not fit in a movie about metal music!The use of real metal musicians as band members was interesting...but most of the musicians were bad actors. I know it won't happen, but it'd be great if another movie centering on the rock music world could be made...this time with a better script. An updating of the Barbra Streisand/Kris Kristofferson movie ""A Star is Born' remade as ""A Rock Star is Born"" would work nicely.",Rock Star
130,BbyParit,I loved it!,9,26 February 2002,I was in my late teens and early 20s in the 1980s.  I loved the hair bands. Most of my friends were in bands and had major dreams of making it big some day.  We loved going on the weekends to see Pantera when they were a little known hair band playing in bars.  It was a fun time.  I loved the hair do's and the clothes and the fun attitudes of Rock and Roll.This movie perfectly captured a guy with a dream.  I believe that it touched on reality of getting all you dreamed for and it not being as happy go lucky as you wanted.. but it didn't try to teach too much of a lesson...it wasn't preachy.. it simply showed a guy reaching his dream and deciding to bow out before it got too out of hand.  I thought this movie was very well done.I loved hearing that sound of the 80s again.,Rock Star
131,Infrared,Heavy Metal: The ABC Afterschool Special,3,11 September 2001,"I like American Cheese as much as the next moviegoer, and on some levels the film does entertain... Mark Wahlberg lends the same innocent-boy charm to this role as he did his Dirk Diggler character in 'Boogie Nights' (matter of fact, he's playing almost the same character here... the biggest difference between them is the hairstyle and lack of, um, prosthetics), but that's not enough to hang a whole movie on...",Rock Star
132,jzorn04,Worst Movie Next to Autumn In New York,1,9 September 2001,"I generally like Mark Wahlberg and I love Jennifer Aniston, but I was robbed, I want my $8.00 back.  No chemistry between the two of them. The plot is good, but not enough of background with the family or ages, nothing is established that makes me feel happy or sad for either of them when he becomes famous.  As to being famous, too many repetitive scenes on stage and  not enough building his demise.  I could not wait for this movie, once I saw the trailer, but to any of you who have not seen it - DON'T BOTHER.  Believe me if you are an 80's hairband fanatic like I was, this does not even come close, sit home and replay your Monsters of Rock Albums!",Rock Star
133,paeyers,almost almost famous..,5,5 September 2001,"Pretty disappointing in all honesty. Saw a preview last night and the (half empty) theatre was sporadically woken up by  the admittedly good music. Rock star wannabee Wahlberg gets the call from English ""metal' band Steel Dragon (played hysterically by a motley crue *pun* of English actors including the excellent Spall) and drops everything to head out to LA. Amazingly, he is upset and initially unwilling to live the life and sticks with his girl, his previous ""band manager"" and useless waste of space Aniston, reprising every bad role she ever did. The movie can't decide whether to be an all-out comedy (the Mom and Pa duo are much more interesting than the rest of the movie) but ultimately it's a couple of hours of mindless entertainment. Leave before the vomit-inducing last five minutes if possible. But do enjoy the soundtrack, the exciting gig sequences and the (almost) believable Marky mark.",Rock Star
134,lmiller943,Great Movie,10,24 January 2002,I really enjoyed this movie.  It had great music in it and I think Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job in his role.

I definately recommend this movie to any music lover who has thought about what it would be like to be in their favorite artist's shoes.,Rock Star
135,jentotherescue,Ok movie,5,25 April 2002,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie despite negative critic statements.  I believe that they were right.This movie had great potential, and I am at a loss for words as to what happened to make it seem mediocre.  I love Mark Walberg, and have seen most movies that he has made.  Seeing all of the rock stars participate in this movie was great, and the music was really fantastic and has been running thru my mind non stop.  There is something lacking in the script evidently...Aniston is too mature and sophisticated to be playing this part and she and Walberg may be too old for the parts on the whole.  I didn't believe her part at all...maybe we are too used to seeing her a certain way.This movie is VERY pale in comarison to ALMOST FAMOUS, and I even dread to mention them in the same breath.See Almost Famous instead!!!!",Rock Star
136,samy_swe,What a waste of time..,2,16 March 2002,"First of all, the genre of this movie isn't comedy, it's more of a drama.I had low expectations on the movie, and still they didn't come up them. As some of the other reviews point out, there are some nice music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music I suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi, or Mötley Crue, it'll be more quality time.Last, if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend ""Almost Famous"".",Rock Star
137,ashleynirk,Long Live Rock N Roll!,10,8 May 2019,"This wild film interprets a wide stream of life in the 1980 Rock n Roll era. Although, the film is especially targeted towards old time rock n' rollers, Rockstar can be enjoyed, loved, and appreciated by all audiences because of its wild atmosphere, intriguing dialogue, and party lifestyle.The era of true-blood rock n roll was a time in life where responsibilities were out of reach and excitement, bad tempers, loud music, and provocative actions came firsthand, right outside your front door. Rock n Roll was a lifestyle, a true love to a lot of people all around the world.
This story line about this individual is motivational and inspirational. With the main character, Chris finding himself through Rock N Roll, as a true unique individual through cultured trials and errors will leave you wanting and wishing for a sequel..

While I am not familiar with the history of the the band portrayed--purportedly Judas Priest--the events portrayed were not blatently far fetched.  Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job of portraying a devoted, but somewhat obsessed fan, of the Steel Dragons who becomes a member of the band.  The photo shoot scene was excellent.The characters were likable and most showed development of the character over time.  A comedy relief character was added.  In the beginning he was humorous, but by the end he is best ignored.Rating 4 out of 5 stars.  For me it is a single viewing movie.  If you like 80's metal/hard rock, the soundtrack will probably be great.",Rock Star

One really releaving aspect about this film is that it steered clear of showing the typical clichés like drug addiction or cheating on the girlfriend etc. That would have been beside the point.

But it's also a devastatingly accurate depiction of the old-school trad metal subculture, and a very funny one (let's face it trad metal subculture is a bit sad :-)Apart from the (Hollywood compulsory) love scenes and the ending (very Hollywood)...don't worry, these only take up about 10 minutes of the total running time....the entire film is one long series of jokes and in-jokes about the scene. The film almost reads like a series of separate sketches...a sketch depicting life in a struggling metal band, a sketch depicting backstage life as a rock star, a sketch depicting the process of album making and so on. All are excellent. At least as good as Spinal Tap, maybe better.Just one possible niggle; I loved this film, but I live for trad metal. I would say that at least half the jokes, especially the visual in-jokes, would be meaningless to anyone not steeped in old school metal and who has never played in an old school metal band.

And the part where the guy is getting full blood transfusion backstage?  Keith Richards wannabe!  Jennifer Aniston was the saving grace of the movie, and there wasn't enough of her.  The bloopers that played during the credits made up for some of the bad acting, but the best part was when ""Good Vibrations"" was played.

153,farmer-jb,"Simple, but fun",6,9 January 2011,"A simple film that plugs in a talented singer for a cover band dreaming to become a genuine 80's rock star. Chris (later to be known as Izzy), is looked upon as a strong leader of his cover band but eventually his obsession with Steel Dragon (his favorite band)and unwillingness to alter the bands sound creates waves of dissatisfaction to his fellow band mates. After a confrontation over the seriousness and intention of playing cover songs, Chris was thought to be misdirected and was eventually kicked out of his own band. Things change, however, after two girls who make themselves out to be groupies, showed front man and lead guitarist Kurt Cunning his video performance. He auditions, he gets in and the rest is pretty simple.I cringed at the end when he would eventually reunite with the girl that he thought got away. I didn't expect this film to go to that region of cheese that you often see in big production films that are distributed by Warner Bros. It almost seems like the writers of the film had no experience and did not conduct interviews to grasp the detail of what life as a rock star really was about. It kept inquisitive guys like myself to prefer to have seen real video clips and interviews from some of the top selling bands of the 80's without the stereotypical and scrape off the top story. It became formulated and predictable to say the least, but the film still has a spark of charm as it relives all of our rock star fantasies that we had when we were kids.6/10.",Rock Star

We all die young is an incredible song, as is Colorful, and Wahlberg's incredible voice more than makes up for a slight lack of complexity in the plot. Having said this, i don't see that as a negative point, as it is a great story.Music aside, the message of the film makes me chuckle each time i see it - that however much you can devote your life to something, and want to be something you're not, a lot of the time you're wrong, and what you really want is what you already had.
