0,kosmasp,Money Money Money,7,23 March 2020,"Money might not talk, but it rules (pun intended). Having it makes you being able to do things, get stuff and just overall have advantages over others. This takes many cases of things that actually happen and has quite a lot of star power behind it (or in front of it/camera). Soderbergh does have that pull, so not really surprising.The quality varies, but overall this is quite decent. There is a message here (or multiple ones I guess), but it still is able to be entertaining. Characters and likeability vary and some will like or hate it for this. But just enjoy an ensemble and some interesting stories - if you can",The Laundromat
1,lee_eisenberg,the rich can get away with anything,8,21 November 2019,"""The Laundromat"" has a giant cast and a simple message: the 1% can always find a way to avoid paying their fair share. The Panama Papers leak exposed how large numbers of rich people were hiding their money in a tax shelter in Panama. Steven Soderbergh's movie goes deeper into how they did this and the various ways that they avoid any serious prosecution.In conclusion, there IS class warfare: the 1% against the 99%.Definitely see it.",The Laundromat
2,sunwarrior13,Helps Gain Knowledge About Panama Papers And Tells That Crime Does Not Pay,10,11 December 2019,"The US investigators are investigating the founders of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Then the movie starring Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman, and Antonio Banderas called ""The Laundromat"" was released. The founders - Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca - sued Netflix of defamation before it was released in 2019. And the story of the Panama-based law firm who are involved in tax evasion through legal loopholes when the 11 million documents of Panama papers was leaked gets more interesting.""The Laundromat"" tells three stories about fictional people that were involved with the law firm Mossack Fonseca and how they were able to help them grow their finances to avoid taxes.Added to that,it also presents how the rich and the powerful sought their services especially in helping them find legal loopholes. As stated in the media, the law firm dating back from the 1970's and have managed to help their clients avoid a total of $1.2 billion taxes.The movie was interesting as it provides the viewer of a comprehensible knowledge of the Panama Papers. Added to that,we also get to see good performances from Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as Mossack and Fonseca respectively as well as Meryl Streep as the widow investigating the firm. The narrative provides the viewer a great way of how the offshore law firm operates in terms of money laundering,tax evasion, bribery, and tax avoidance and who their clients are. Added to that,it also allows the viewer to think about amount of taxes that the government is charging an individual: Overtaxed or not? Finally, it also provides the viewer entertainment and gains knowledge of a scam as well as crime truly does not pay in the end.",The Laundromat
3,CinemaSerf,The search for the truth wasn't down this blind alley...,6,10 December 2019,"This had the potential to be an eye-opening opportunity to bring to the fore all the devious antics and off-shore activities carried out by people from all nations - but recently publicised by the Mossack-Fonseca revelations. Instead, it delivered a largely pedestrian investi-journo kind of piece that traded heavily on the names of it's three stars and very little on any meaningful substance. The two-handers between Messrs. Oldman and Banderas are witty and focused, but captured against the banality of the rest of the film merely serve to illustrate why sheep have a shepherd. Meryl Streep is, I think, going for the Dame Judi Dench ""how little screen-time can I get away with whilst still getting top billing award"". What an open goal; what a miss....!",The Laundromat
4,ferguson-6,fraudulent,5,10 October 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. The meek may inherit the earth, but if this Steven Soderbergh movie based on Jake Bernstein's book (screenplay by Scott Z Burns) is correct, they aren't likely to get the money too. To put it more bluntly, the first of the film's 5 rules of creating and protecting wealth is, ""the meek are screwed."" In order to follow this film that is ""based on true secrets"", it helps to have a basic knowledge of the Panama Papers ... a 2016 anonymous leak of more than 11 million documents exposing how the rich skirt the laws when it comes to protecting their money. Offshore entities had previously been a mainstream punchline, but these documents from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama, clearly outlined just how widespread the practice had become.Rather than traditional narrative form, the information is presented through multiple vignettes featuring an impressive roster of well-known actors: Meryl Streep, Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Melissa Rauch, David Schwimmer, James Cromwell, Matthias Schoenaerts, Robert Patrick, Nonso Anozie, and Rosalind Chao, plus a few others you'll recognize. In the role of tongue-in-cheek emcees are Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, as Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, respectively. Their coordinating flamboyant outfits correspond to these caricatures of the real men behind this web of fraudulent activity. They are meant to add humor to the situation, but also tell ""their side of the story.""We are caught off-guard when Meryl Streep's story and her character are not the main focus. Her slow unraveling of insurance fraud after her husband's death is but one segment of the lesson that will likely confuse most people. The easy comparison is Adam McKay's THE BIG SHORT (2015), which used some of this style in explaining the mortgage backed securities market. Whereas Mr. McKay won an Oscar for his screenplay, that's highly unlikely for this one. Scott Z Burns is a talented writer, but this was simply too complex of a subject to tackle in 95 minutes. Mr. Soderbergh, as is tendency, not only directs the film, but is also the cinematographer, editor and producer.This is a Netflix production, and thanks to the presence of Ms. Streep, will likely have at least a limited theatrical release. Unfortunately, neither big screen nor small will solve the inherent issues here. There are some nuggets such as Delaware, despite its population of less than one million, being king of corporation filings (thanks to its business-friendly tax laws). Understanding shell companies, tax evasion, and other illicit financial activities among the world's ultra-rich requires more than a talented cast, but perhaps there is enough here to motivate some to dig a little deeper with their own research. That is, if the film's finale - a lecture on reform - doesn't turn you off completely. Many of us appreciate being informed, but rebel against the preaching.",The Laundromat
5,phd_travel,Good job making a complicated affair entertaining and mostly comprehensible,9,20 October 2019,First of all you need to concentrate in this rewarding movie about the Panama Papers. Some of the transactions may be confusing but you don't have to understand it all to enjoy the movie. The bigger picture will come to light.It's not easy to make a dry complicated topic accessible and entertaining. They more or less succeeded here. There are 3 highlighted chains of the scandal all linked to the lawyers Mossack and Fonseca played by Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman who narrate through thick accents. 1. Meryl plays a woman pursuing a insurance claim from a boat accident that wasn't paid because of a shell corporation formed by MF. 2. An obviously corrupt African man in LA using shell corporations he claimed were valuable but were emptied out to defraud. 3. The Chongqing corruption scandal of Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai involving murder and money laundering via such companies.Worth a watch.,The Laundromat

They try to explain it in a funny way, but even then I'm still not getting all the scams. And that's just because I'm an antisocial person that wants to live as far away as possible from people like that. The movie is worth a watch because of the very good cast. Gary Oldman, Antonio Banderas, Meryl Streep for the bigger roles, Matthias Schoenaerts, Sharon Stone, David Schwimmer and others for the smaller parts. It's well filmed and brought, and even if it's very far away from my way of life, and that I still don't understand half of the possible scams, it's entertaining.

7,MOscarbradley,Entertaining but nowhere near as 'deep' as it should be.,6,7 November 2019,"A tragic accident on a lake in which 21 people died is the catalyst that kicks off this surreal comedy-drama about the Mossack-Fonseca scandal and what came to be known as the Panama Papers. It's certainly entertaining but too cartoonish, (not to mention, too complicated), to really hit home despite an all-star cast headed by Meryl Streep as a woman whose husband was one of the lake victims and whose digging into what turned out to be one hell of a giant fraud brought matters to a head.Others involved include Gary Oldman, (outsanding), as Mossack and Antonio Banderas as Fonseca as well as Sharon Stone, David Schwimmer, Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts. The director is Steven Soderbergh and this is one of his 'entertainments' but it's one of his lesser ones. It's like an illustrated lecture but one where the lecturer is so unsure of his material he has to keep cracking jokes, not all of them that funny. It's certainly not a complete disaster but once it's over you're unlikely to remember a single moment.",The Laundromat
8,Cineanalyst,Nakedly Preachy,3,26 October 2019,"There's a problem with message films. At worst, they're dishonest and insulting--instructing us under the guise of art and entertainment and using the same didactic tactics otherwise decried as propaganda. Even if one agrees with the message, it's mostly an echo chamber. Perhaps, you'll learn a lesson, but there are other forms better suited for that than fiction filmmaking. Granted, a documentary (say, ""The Panama Papers"" (2018)) or book (""Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers Investigation of Illicit Money Networks and the Global Elite"") may reach fewer people than a movie on Netflix featuring a bunch of stars, but ""The Laundromat"" is dealing with a recent, well-covered news story in the Panama Papers and one that wasn't shocking to many people, anyways. The haphazard, perhaps unintentional, critique of religion here, on the message of the meek inheriting the Earth, was surprising, but this is an otherwise unenlightening picture. Perhaps, worst still, ""The Laundromat"" rips-off the explanatory fourth-wall-breaking form of ""The Big Short"" (2015), but with the condescension ramped up of ""Vice"" (2018). Director Steven Soderbergh and company have handled star-studded, multi-threaded plots better before, such as in the also-polemic ""Traffic"" (2000) and ""Contagion"" (2011), but ""The Laundromat"" is far more disorganized and veers into irrelevant, only sometimes amusing, storylines. Moreover, the picture is arguably at its best and worst in deconstructing its own artifice, which, unfortunately, also makes way for a lecture-within-the-lecture that is even more blunt than the rest of the proceedings.If not for this deconstructive finale, where the movie's sound stage is exposed as Meryl Streep removes the costume of her dual roles, her character(s) would otherwise add nothing to the moral other than to suture the ""meek,"" or common man, into a narrative about the shady practices of plutocrats. Throughout, these average-Joe characters act partly as investigators, but none of it goes anywhere (Streep's character even tries to get a reporter interested in the story), as the firm's documents were leaked by an anonymous whistleblower. Storylines such as Streep's character losing out on an apartment and extended detours including Los Angeles and China are largely immaterial, while Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas breaking the fourth wall to directly and needlessly explain such things as what cash and credit are to the audience becomes patronizing. Meanwhile, it's unseemly how the ""meek"" are sometimes exploited here for crass gags, such as the brief, gimmicky-photographed episode where Pablo Escobar's gang murders two random Americans, or where the token president of the firms' shell companies, but who herself is a poor Panamanian who rides the bus is electrocuted in a freak accident. The latter, I suppose, allows Streep to compete with Oldman for most obnoxious accent affectation. Unfortunately, there wasn't much here especially clever or sound to be deconstructed in the end. It's just a mess that becomes more nakedly preachy building up to its last diatribe.",The Laundromat
9,cruise01,Tries to be fun but falls flat with its boring direction.,4,18 October 2019,"2 out of 5 stars.The Laundromat is a similar take like The Big Short movie which focuses on real drama and events about insurance fraud by Mossack Fonseca scandal. Showing the underground of the corrupt financial system. However, the film tries to be fun with a serious matter. The Big Short worked with taking a serious matter and explaining the situation to the audience. The Laundromat fails completely with the insurance fraud scheme. Narrated by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas which they explain about the underground world of insurance and their way of fixing the system for them to be rich. While people who are trying to file a claim does not see a cent.The plot is boring, convoluted, and dull. Following several characters. Meryl Streep plays a character who is trying to file an insurance claim after an accident on a tour boat leaves her a widow. The film follows other who are stuck in a world of bribery, corruption, and adjusters who are trying to get rich. The film is not funny. It is more boring and a drag for its short running time.The script and direction tries to be fun with the characters breaking the fourth wall but fails with a topic that is not interesting at all. The cast is great. They are stuck in a film that does not have any developing story or characterization.Overall, The Laundromat is a bad film. It is boring. It is slow. It lacks its fun energy which it is trying so hard to be with such a serious topic. This film is definitely a miss.",The Laundromat
10,digitalbeachbum,"Don't listen to the trolls, it's telling the truth",10,19 October 2019,"The ending of this movie sums it all up about the vicious cycle of the world of greed. People with money pay politicians to make laws to protect their money. Then in turn, the politicians become wealthy and use the same laws that they have on the books to protect their money. The wealthy elite then give money to maintain the status quo. They continue this process, occasionally showing the public a little punishment to a few, but nothing is reformed. There is no protection to the middle class who bear the burden of living.People who don't like this movie, they are either people who support the current system or they don't like the actors or director. It's plain and simple. I can see giving this movie a 7/10 for a variety of technical issues, but not for the content. The movie is real, and truthful, even though they present in a comical format.I thought it was well done and I thought that they did a fantastic job of hiding cameos from other actors, while also presenting what happened in real life.

The true cause of global warming is global debt, which fuels the investments in oil, coal and gas. But that's only a ""side"" issue.The world wide economy almost crashed in 2008 and it's NOW (2020) still as vulnerable as it was back then, simply because of the global debt bubble which is being pumped up bigger and bigger until it eventually will burst as it did in 1929, which was followed by histories' most devastating global economy collapse and world war II.This movie is an admirable attempt of EXPLAINING the global debt genocide, which is currently going on, packaged as a comedy. Unfortunately this movie is NOT really funny. That's the bad. but it's explanation about the causes of the 2008 banking crisis and the global banking fraud is spot on and very informative for those who like to listen carefully...UNFORTUNATELY this combination of a comedy and a explanatory story about the global fraudulent banking crisis of 2008 until now (2020) never really takes off and never really becomes funny.The intent is good, the actors are good, but the execution unfortunately fails miserably. 5 stars for trying.

13,Turfseer,Complicated offshore money laundering scam could work better as a documentary,4,26 November 2019,"Veteran filmmaker Steven Soderbergh has ventured into the realm of black comedy here in this true life story based on the nefarious exploits of Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, who were ultimately convicted of crimes related to money laundering, while operating the Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, a provider of offshore financial services.
Unfortunately, Soderbergh has bit off way more than he can chew here in presenting such a narrative, as it's so complicated and convoluted, that one finds oneself immediately consulting the plot summary in Wikipedia, to figure out exactly what went on from scene to scene. I can tell you right now that The Laundromat would have worked much better as a documentary than a feature film, which attempts to mine laughs from unfortunate dupes who fell prey to the machinations of professional con artists.
The story is wryly narrated by comic versions of Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Fonseca (Antonio Banderas), as they explain the intricacies of money laundering. Their idea is to create a plethora of shell companies, which insulate them from ever being discovered. Their first mark is Ellen Martin (Meryl Streep), who attempts to recover insurance money after her husband drowns when a pleasure boat capsizes during an excursion on Lake George.
To her chagrin, Ellen soon discovers that she'll be unable to collect any money from the reinsurance company as it's actually a trust (as Wikipedia informs) to one of Mossack's shell companies, now being investigated by the IRS for fraud.
In addition to Ellen's story, two other plotlines involve victims of the Mossack Fonseca scheme: one the daughter of an African billionaire, in which the father gives her bearer bonds (which turn out to be worthless as they are part of a shell company), in order to buy her silence over an affair he's been having with another woman. And a second story involving an intermediary for a wealthy Chinese family who ends up murdered while laundering money for the family through another one of Mossack's shell companies.
Streep as Ellen goes undercover to expose the partners and they eventually are arrested, serve a short time in prison, with the firm ultimately dissolved. Soderbergh gets preachy at film's end as Streep rips off her disguise (including a wig) and pontificates about the pervasiveness of these notorious offshore financial services which lead to enormous profits on behalf of criminals who rarely are caught, or pay any kind of price.
Soderbergh's point is that crimes such as this have a Kafkaesque quality that are more deserving of sad laughter than unmitigated outrage (he saves the outrage for the last few minutes and the shift in tone doesn't work at all). If you can follow what's going on here in terms of plot, more power to you. But The Laundromat is one of those rare cases where the complicated nature of the story puts a big damper on actually enjoying it.",The Laundromat

15,alindsay-al,A Poor boring film,3,30 December 2019,"I had some free time so I decided to watch this film due to the premise and the cast but I was serverly disappointed and thought this film was pretty boring. The premise of the film sees a woman attempt to recover her life from two money launderers. Meryl Streep plays the lead in this film and she tries her best in the role and clearly cares about her role but her character is pretty boring. There isn't much to her role and even though the film tries I just didn't care about her character at all in this film. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas are easily the best part of this film, they have very good chemistry together in their roles and was the most entertaining part of the film. This film has some big name actors such as Jeffery Wright, David Schwimmer and Robert Patrick but they do so little in this film that you just don't care for any of them or understand why they were even cast in their roles. The story should have been interesting given the premise but it just wasn't, the plot tries to focus on so many different things but in the end doesn't give enough to it to make you care about anybody in this film. The script has some decent humour in it that makes you chuckle but it isn't that funny and the drama isn't particularly good to make you care. The style of the film doesn't work for this film as it is just over 90 mins long and doesn't give any character enough screen time for you to care or get emotionally invested.

It also highlights the laws, particularly in the US, which makes such strategies possible to this day. This is based on the scandal that came to light quite recently through the leakage of The Panama Papers.This is quirky stuff, sometimes funny, sometimes quite scary but on the whole pretty entertaining.

Aside from the political points, the main story is one woman is out to hold one company accountable. Her husband died in a tour boating accident and isn't paying up for the insurance. Watch as she digs deep into the corruption game to peel back the layers of shell corporations. Being retired she has ample time.

Unfortunately, the pacing and plotting is convoluted and too many intercontinental characters are involved to care about any of them.Besides, Oldman's German accent was annoying to the point of distraction.

There's a hint of surrealism in the style chosen using two of the dirty attorneys as revolving narrators . So, for entertainment sake it jumps around a bit, throws curves instead of straightballs, and uses Ms. Streep in a novel way as will be revealed at a proper time. The movie wants not just to entertain though as it kind of condems a system expressly made for the rich including ""fuzzy"" tax laws that can be bent to suit while the average hard working honest person is victimized. Like a virulent disease with exploits a willing host, such is the creative game of tax avoidance. That is the bottom line. The ride, well, it's something else. The fact a single law firm washed so much wealth is, apparently, true. The hard truth that som few have answered is also true. It's the stories here that, while entertaining to an extent, fail to create the outrage that is obviously hoped for. I think there is a core story here that gets too much of Hollywood treatment to succeed on either the whistleblower or the entertainment level. At the end of the day I find it very disturbing. Disturbing because in the end this makes a bit of joke out of it even as it tries for a clear ending where the make-up comes off and a demand for change is the final scene.

26,jadepietro,A Political Spin That Loses Its Balance,5,31 October 2019,"GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A political film about greed and corruption that has lofty goals but disappoints in its fragmented storytelling.JIM'S REVIEW: There are plenty of bad greedy guys, all wheeling and dealing in Steven Soderburgh's overly complicated and ultimately tiring docudrama, The Laundromat. All of the many illegal activities lead to a hidden paper trail involving off-shore drug trafficking, tax evasion, bribery, money laundering and murder. Based on true events, the film has lofty goals but doesn't always succeed in its execution.The Laundromat begins promisingly with a tragic turn of events that act as a catalyst for an older housewife, Ellen Martin (Meryl Streep, in fine Erin Brockovich form), who soon discovers improprieties that implode her everyday life and cause her to become a crusader for the common woman. As long as the film stays with this intriguing character and her dilemma, the movie totally engages. But soon the domino effect begins, the story meanders, and the ""bigger picture"" interferes. The filmmakers feel the need to include other less interesting vignettes about other nefarious individuals and their crooked ways to highlight the global graft and corruption.Mr. Soderburgh tries to simplify the complex plot which is more convoluted than a rolling hitch knot, but there remains one or two hitches in the storytelling as well. Although one can admire Scott Z. Burns' intelligent but misguided screenplay, the film contains too much information and needed to limit its scope in order to have more impact.Fancy graphics and title cards are used to grandstand the dryness of the financial subject matter but the film structure trips on its own stylish devices. Narrating the crazy goings-on are the film's main villains and evil masterminds, Jürgen Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Ramón Fonseca (Antonio Banderas). The actors play their roles with charm and sly wit as they explain the economic ramifications in terms that common folk can understand. But there is just too much material to cover.Mr. Soderburgh also makes a few bad decisions along the way in some of his casting choices, primarily the role of Elena, and his twisted ending of breaking down the fourth wall seriously undercuts the entire film with its jarring proselytizing messaging.Like I said, one or two knots too many. The Laundromat needs to use its spin cycle more effectively.",The Laundromat

28,fntstcplnt,The Laundromat (2019),5,25 December 2019,"Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Starring Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman, Antonio Banderas, Nonso Anozie, David Schwimmer, David Wright, Jessica Allain, Sharon Stone, Matthias Schoenaerts, Rosalind Chao, Melissa Rauch, James Cromwell, Robert Patrick, Larry Wilmore. (R)Sardonic comedy drama based on a true story (the Mossack Fonseca scandal after the leaking of the ""Panama Papers"") cycles amongst several stories without ever fully cohering. Starts well with a stylized introduction from narrators (and co-founders at the center of the shady law firm) Oldman and Banderas, which leads into the story of Streep unable to get fair compensation following the accidental death of her husband, but the script loses focus quick, and subsequent stories/interludes provide lesser and lesser returns (and pleasures). Seems designed to keep the audience at an arm's length for the sake of its mocking, cynical tone, which would be fine, except that it eventually tries to stir the passion of outrage in the viewer, which doesn't work at all. Streep has a distracting dual role (three-fer, if you count the part where she breaks the fourth wall as herself), but she effortlessly inhabits the plucky widow the way that only she can; Oldman and Banderas are almost cloyingly arch, but manage a few amusing moments. Considering the pedigree involved--director Soderbergh, screenwriter Scott Z. Burns, a large and talented cast (many in bit parts and cameos)--a missed opportunity and overall disappointment.47/100",The Laundromat
29,martimusross,"Beyond Boring, A Movie That Should Never Have Been Made",2,17 November 2019,"The LaundromatThere was just no narrative drive to this movie, it just descended into irritating minutiae, mainly supplied by Meryl Streep herself who appeared nothing more than a financial virgin. The whole thing was based on the findings of the ""Panama Papers"" that uncovered corruption.There were strange financial explanations interjected as chapters by Antonio Bandaras and Gary Oldman which were just artifice.This project was stuffed with stars but it was unworthy of them, I get the feeling they turned up for the pay-cheque as it had no artistic merit.The fundamental flaw of this movie was that the acting was necessarily superficial and the financial fraud could just not be attributed to one single person or one single source or indeed one single reason, the crime seemed to gather over time and the law failed to react in a timely manner, a really quite unremarkable observation.The movie just kept restating the obvious fact that there are lots of crooks in the world and you need to buy financial services from a reputable company and this is not likely to be based in Panama, Nevis or Caymen. The further point that governments need to act to prevent these financial viewpoints will probably occur as a result of the Panama papers and a greater understanding of these complex frauds. Why they thought it was making a movie about this I have no clue.The acting was crisp and proficient but nothing remarkable as it never rose above its subject matter.",The Laundromat

Upon knowing more about the story, in addition to Meryl Streep and Soderberg, I decided to give it another try. There's something there, though again I lost interest about halfway through.The enjoyable part was the criminal activities. I liked the scummy characters involved in schemes and shell companies, etc. It might have been for a new audience. The up and coming millennials. Meryl Streep was a very weak character. There were traces of her being a Las Vegas party girl in her younger years, and that sorta reflects her current life. And then there's her happy long marriage. She just didn't have any depth, and you didn't learn to care about her.I believe all the characters were a little flat. The story was also kind of weak. There was nothing hard hitting. It sort of just floated in and out of situations. Some were cool to watch, like the accountant getting arrested. Or the beginning, with the apes and a flashback into humanities past. Other than that, nothing too major here.I wish this movie had been better. It seemed like it really had a lot going, and such power behind it. I was disappointed I guess.6 stars",The Laundromat

33,carbuff,Painfully preachy & would have been better as a straight documentary.,5,3 November 2019,"""The Laundromat"" is based on the Panama Papers document leak. If you've never heard of that, this might not be a bad movie to watch. If you're familiar with the incident and fairly sophisticated about taxes and finance, this film will only leave you wanting for more hard, straight facts. Also, the movie didn't seem to like to mention that plenty of ""good"" (read ""liberal"") celebrities were named in the release too, not just evil right-wingers. Historically, tax evasion and tax avoidance (the first illegal and the second legal) haven't respected party loyalties. I personally watched it just to see how in depth it went, and it wasn't far. The preachy Meryl Streep character was just annoying, and, I'm guessing, she's got her very considerable personal fortune carefully managed by people who are much more devoted to their ""Wall Street Journal"" subscriptions than their ""New York Times"" ones. So, as an introduction to this kind of material (shell companies, offshore accounts, and such), this film is adequate, but I personally would have much preferred a hard-hitting ""Frontline"" style documentary--drier maybe, but vastly more nutritious.",The Laundromat
34,bankofmarquis,Fun and Interesting,8,1 August 2021,"Do remember the Oscar nominated film THE BIG SHORT from 2015, where Director Adam McKay would make sense out of a dry subject (the financial crisis of 2008) by breaking the 4th wall and speaking directly to the audience, while also wrapping in a very strong emotional drama?Well...Director Steven Soderbergh (ERIN BROCKOVICH) has taken that recipe and attached it to another dry subject (this time money laundering through off-shore ""Shell Companies"") and has turned in a very good and interesting (though not quite as intense) film that got lost in the shuffle in 2019.Starring Meryl Streep as a widow who is trying to get her Insurance Company to pay off after the death of her husband, THE LAUNDROMAT follows the trail through shell company after shell company as the money is Laundered by 2 unscrupulous Bankers (Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas) in a series of vignettes.While THE LAUNDROMAT doesn't pack the punch of THE BIG SHORT (where the real life consequences of what happened impacted many, many people throughout the world), THE LAUNDROMAT falls just short in that only Meryl Streep's character really suffers the consequences (though many unscrupulous players do get theirs in the end).Soderbergh is a Director who's work I have really, really liked throughout his career as he has a tendency to focus on the people, rather than spectacle, when telling a story, and it works well in this film. He gets the audience to care about the victims of the scheming money men and root like crazy for the ""bad guys"" to get theirs.As for the acting, Meryl Streep (of course) is marvelous as Ellen Martin, the widow who's tragic experience (the death of her husband - played by the great James Cromwell) sets off the course of events in this film.Oldman and Banderas are equally as good as the narrators and antagonists of this piece. They play their roles with a slight wink in their eyes and a ""devil-may-care"" attitude which makes them charming, but does take a notch (or so) off of the drama of the piece.Soderbergh, as he is want to do, fills this film with many memorable actors/characters in what amounts to extended cameos - Jeffrey Wright, Robert Patrick, David Schwimmer, Will Forte, Chris Parnell, Larry Wilmore and even Sharon Stone stop by for a moment to bring other characters into play and they all work well.To be fair, some of the vignettes work better than the others, but all-in-all Soderbergh has crafted an interesting, fun and IMPORTANT film that will teach it's audience about the inner workings of a system that most of us have heard about but never really looked into.Check out THE LAUNDROMAT the next time you are scrolling through Netflix looking for something good to watch.Letter Grade A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Laundromat

36,kjproulx,"Well-Made And Unique, But Ultimately A Failure",4,23 October 2019,"Every so often a film seems great on paper, a stellar cast is assembled, a fantastic crew is brought on board, and yet just simply completely misses the mark as a finished film. I have been a fan of director Steven Soderbergh for years and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, but I have admitted when I watch a bad movie, even if it's from a director that I really like. The Laundromat recently made the rounds at a few film festivals, but I never got around to seeing this one. Recently dropping on Netflix, I finally sat down to watch it and I was very disappointed.At its core, The Laundromat is based on the true events of insurance fraud that was discovered when Ellen Martin (Meryl Streep) began to make deals across the border. This seems like it could make for an interesting story and while that set-up is intriguing, this movie has a very messy and muddled way of presenting it or even getting its audience engaged. Told in some unique ways, this film tries too hard to impress its audience with techniques, rather than focussing on the story at hand.Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas are very enjoyable as two men who directly narrate to the camera, in person, which was easily my favorite aspect of the film, but they also took away from the interesting portion of the story by explaining everything so much. Everything about this movie felt like a catch-22 in terms of being able to enjoy it. This movie begins and ends at a very slow pace, with very little meat in the middle of the story. I appreciated the attempt at having a unique spin on storytelling, but it didn't work for me.With a director like Steven Soderbergh who is admittedly doing as great a job as ever, performers like Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman, Antonio Banderas, Jeffrey Wright (who are only some of the notables here) lighting up the screen, and an overall story that is intriguing on its surface, this is a film that's ruined by its structure. Although I love Oldman and Banderas, I feel where the story leads with them could have been easily done in a different way. The constant cutting to their narration threw me out of the movie. I'm not saying this would have made the whole movie better, but it was absolutely the portion that stood out to me the most.In the end, The Laundromat is a prime example of a movie that is commendable for being unique and trying new things, but it ultimately failed for me. Netflix has been releasing some great content lately, but they're known for having a lot of misfires too. I think this movie will find a bigger audience on Netflix than it would have in theatres, so I feel there is no harm at all with this release. Sadly, even on Netflix, I can't recommend checking this one out. It's just not engaging enough.",The Laundromat
37,JohnRayPeterson,"A humorous caricature telling of serious consequences, it's an original presentation.",6,12 December 2019,"With a cast of major stars and plenty of others familiar to us, this movie tells a story in an original form; it has Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas acting mostly as narrators in their characters, as the eccentric lighthearted villains but unquestionably as villains, and those villains exist in real life, outed by The Panama Papers. Some viewers may be taken aback with this form of narration, but if the likes of Meryl Streep along with Oldman and Banderas have signed on to the project, you must assume it had enough merit in the story itself and it's what kept me watching, to my relative satisfaction in the end. Some of you may not have that patience and best you know that now; it explains many of the low scores/ratings.If you haven't seen the documentary 'The Panama Papers' in 2018 or gave up on it, 'The Laudromat' offers up a very different approach but one perhaps more palatable to some. You will have at least two perspective to the real story of crime, fraud on a massive scale and international in scope; the first from the satirical voices of the villains, and the second from that of victims.What's hard to digest is the mix of the two styles used to offer up those perspectives. It will work for some of you, not so much for others. I chose to be neutral because I'll usually give that much leeway to a Soderbergh movie. If you haven't read books on The Panama Papers, the many articles and watched the documentary I mentioned, at least give this a try; it's one of those things you should know about even if only from a caricature movie. By the way, Meryl Streep saved that movie in my case, she may weel do the same for you, but I can't promise that.",The Laundromat
38,skepticskeptical,Mishmash of a mockumentary,5,25 December 2019,"The Laundromat broaches so many stories and so many issues that it is a bit hard to keep track of all of the connections. The director seems to have decided that by appending a sledgehammer public service announcement at the end, all would be resolved. Unfortunately, it did nothing but make me wish that the last ten minutes were simply excluded from the film.Each of the loosely connected vignettes could have been developed to become the substance of much better films. Certainly the episode in China deserved a longer treatment and further elucidation. I also found that the first vignette was poorly set-up and completely implausible. Does anyone really believe that twenty-one people would die after a small boat overturned on a lake as a result of a tidal wave? Really any story of the little guy being screwed by his insurance company could have worked here. Not at all sure why the writer and/or director made this choice. It is also highly ironic that a clip of Barack Obama talking about the Panama papers is included, given that he bailed out the big banks in the aftermath of the mortgage derivatives scam which drove millions of homeowners to foreclosure, some of whom are now living in tents in California. (Of course, Barack Obama now graces the board of Netflix, and helps to select content, so perhaps it makes sense after all.)The topic of financial malfeasance is very interesting and certainly relevant but The Laundromat ends up being, more than anything else, a via negativa lesson in filmmaking: Less is more.",The Laundromat
39,Alexander_Blanchett,Very good acting and very well done.,8,18 October 2019,"A nice little movie in the tradition of Adam McKay's Vice and The Big Short. This mixed with the unique style of Steven Soderbergh results in a quirky and entertaining movie about a rather boring topic.
Its informative, funny, a bit sad at times and always extremely well acted.
The most outstanding performance came from Meryl Streep who really surprises ( I am not saying too much here) and really links her unique humour with many deep moments. A really great performance, but who would have expected differently? Gary Oldman was also great. One of his funniest performances ever, never thought he had it in, Obviously Oldman had a lot of fun playing this role and it showed. Same goes to Antonio Banderas who also shines as Oldman's partner.
Them breaking the fourth wall was sometimes a bit irritating but you got used to it very quickly. Another noteworthy performance was by Nonso Anzonie who was fantastic. Wished there had been more of Sharon Stone , I really enjoyed her cameo and character. Also Jeffrey Wright, almost unrecognizable, had some really memorable moments.
The screenplay was really very well written and I really liked Steven Soderbergh's direction on this. He really managed to make such a dry topic entertaining. The only thing I really did not like too much was the very ending of it. Other than that it is a very good film and one of this years Netflix best.",The Laundromat

A starry cast is largely wasted, and Meryl's Streep's closing monologue fails to provoke the anger and activism it should, out of step as it is with the rest of the film.

Specifically here we follow Ellen Martin (Meryl Streep) who is swindled out of life earnings through a fake instance policy which she begins to investigate. What is thoroughly engaging about this is not only Streep's performance which grounds the film on a more emotional level, but also the interweaving of third wall breaking narration and thesis' on money given by Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman portraying two law partners and clearly having a lot of fun and being on top form doing it! Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Oceans Eleven, Contagion) and written by his frequent collaborator Scott Z. Burns, they've created a visually and thematically interesting study here while also keeping it darkly funny. I personally struggle to follow intricate details of films that specialise in this type of subject matter (Adam McKay's The Big Short being a perfect example) but that doesn't dampen my enjoyment of the film itself. Although it does go off on tangents particularly when the narrative diverts and introduces new cases of fraud, as soon as Oldman, Banderas or Streep are back on screen, it captures my attention fully and the subject explored is cause for great concern.

They will uncover the most important secrets that wealthy people practice to remain rich. This is usually a very complicated topic to treat (finance is pretty complicated to understand), but the way they explain, is very audience friendly, so you don't have to focus so much in order to follow them.Many big names were involved in this production. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas play respectively Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca. Their acting is perhaps too forced, especially the accent that Oldman makes is particularly annoying. I understand that this is made on purpose to give that comedy taste, but I did not enjoy it at all.

Her investigation turns to be a deep rabbit hole where there are gaps around fraud and questionable shell-like entities. The somewhat charming and always very well-dressed partners Jürgen Mossack, played by Gary Oldman and Ramón Fonseca played by Antonio Banderas narrate how the world's richest exploit the global financial system though tax evasion, tax avoidance, bribery and other illicit absurdities which feed the corrupt financial system. Their performances in the movie engage the audience in an enjoyable, funny, exposing manner around the corrupt system of offshore accounts by talking through three distinct stories which connects you to how corrupt our financial system is in varying degrees.Ladies and gents this is your dummy guide to the ""Panama Papers"", a scandal leaked in 2016, where a whistle-blower released over millions and millions of documents from the law firm Mossack & Fonseca - which is just one of many law firms who deal with questionable shell holding entities used by some of the world's richest people in order to avoid paying taxes. These law firms obviously know the law and push the law as far as the law will allow in order to serve their own purposes. Since I had a brief overview of the Panama Paper it was a shame there was no mention journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who originally first broke the concept of the shell entitied linked to Panama City law firm. Other then that the general story around how these shell entities helped the world's wealthiest people to avoid tax burden was well directed. The movie is easy to follow and amusing, even as you feel you should be angry and also makes you think whether this film won't change a thing.Meryl Streep again outdoes her character and her performance which surprised me in the end is worth watching to see her unique humour with many deep moments. A really great performance, but who would have expected differently? Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas were also great with both trying to seduce the audience of their immoral ways around the financial system while breaking the fourth wall with wit and humour.

54,WalkdenEntertainment,Strong message for all but it's a weak film...,4,19 October 2019,"Our film follows Ellen (Meryl Streep) who has begun her own investigation into an insurance company. Her search was started by an accident involving herself, her husband and a tourist boat, leading to the death of her husband and the drowning of many people.While Ellen's character is the main focus of the film, The Laundromat shares multiple stories with different view points, all pointing out issues relating to the finance company Ellen is investigating. Each story shows the company's major corruption and those who get away with it daily.While watching the film, it's very evident that the director (Steven Soderbergh) is passionate about this topic and he wanted to get things off his chest. By the end of the film, you will find out he isn't the only one... During the film we are also somewhat educated by some Financial Partners played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, who continually break ""the fourth wall"" and speak to the audience. The information that is shared could be insightful for some and boring for others...The Laundromat for me is a huge disappointment which is a shame because I feel the message driving the film is actually important for many to hear.Instead of following one story we have many. Sometimes the story of these characters didn't justify their purpose for being in the film. Another annoying factor is there are many named actors who are given less than 5 mins of screen time, including David Schwimmer, Jeffery Wright, Robert Patrick, Sharon Stone & Will Forte. I feel that the list of big actors were used as a ""draw card"" to get more viewers into watching this film.Needless to say, whenever Meryl Streep is off screen, the film is weaker. Not just because of her acting ability (although she is an amazing woman), but because her character is the only character I felt it was worth investing in.The cinematography is also disappointing and patchy. Certain cuts in key scenes are rather odd and don't seem fitting for this type of story. By the time the film ended, I couldn't help but think that maybe the film had many cuts and edits while in post production? Because of these cuts and the way of it tells each story, it cheapens the film and also makes the main story hollow and dull. There is also a ""twist"" element in the film which I found far too predictable and ridiculous.Overall, considering this is based on a true story and there is a strong message to share with the world, it's disappointing to me that this wasn't done better. Obviously actress Meryl Streep gives a solid performance but the film's style, dull story telling and odd cinematography as well as editing makes the film overall patchy and dull. Some financial talk may also only attract a small quantity of audiences.3.9/10

The asymmetrical presentation and portrayal of the story is a delight to watch. The movie is more of an education rather than entertainment. The biggest plus of the movie is that, We get to see who all benefit when some of us lose money to the corporates.Steven Soderbergh shows the way in his own style, with his different treatment. Screenplay is decent in filtering corporate jargon that is usable to the layman. Cinematography is as brilliant as in any Soderbergh movie. Costumes & makeup were a touch overdone for film of this genre. Thankfully the run time is 95 minutes, anything more would have spoiled whatever the little good work that Steven Soderbergh had done in the first place.

Adam McKay's ""The Big Short. A preachy film that tells you things you've probably known for a long time. How rich people and their lawyers are manipulating and creating the laws of the society, and how the average guy trying to scrape out a living, is really a schmuck because he is powerless to do anything. While this is not ""Fake News"", it can definitely be called ""Old News"".Thank God there is a first rate cast to try to make sense of it all. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas are first rate. Both are equal parts charming, easy going and smarmy. While their dialogue did not always make a lot of sense, they were engaging and humorous and, you could tell that they were enjoying every bit of their con man performance.Meryl Streep, as usual, is excellent as the unintended victim of these two lawyers.
She is the one that is left to tell the audience what all of this means in today's terms.Interesting, but not essential to see.6 out of 10",The Laundromat

I guess some people honestly think this is a great movie, but raves and blurb-like headings for bad films always sound fishy.

62,cordenw,I once worked in a bank in a tax haven,8,21 October 2019,"Many years ago of course, but as I look back I now realize that this sort of financial treachery has been going on since the Garden of Eden.As a callow youth back in the early 70's on the Island of Jersey in the Channel Islands I landed a job at one of the ""conduit banks"" that handled remittances from overseas colonies , countries in Africa, The Middle East, India, Pakistan etc.Even then it was shrouded in secrecy and I was too young to realize that the stuff that was going on was mainly designed by Accountants and Lawyers to keep money out of the hands of Governments who wanted it so they could steal it themselves.Local lawyers were given seats on the boards of locally incorporated companies with shares to go along with the appointment but with pre-signed letters of resignation should they get out of line.
In those early 70's it was just an infant industry compared to today , the fire was lit by the fall of the Soviet Union, The European Union and the economic rise of China.So many more crooks materialized with a need to hide their loot.What was millions before, quickly became hundreds of billions as the aforesaid accountants and lawyers looked for loopholes and paperwork to get around taxation laws.It wasn't the politicians who deliberately drew up the laws to allow this exploitation, they usually ain't smart enough, but the lawyers and accountants ARE smart enough and that's why we have this debacle. The problem is that everything is just this side of legal so no one can do much about it.My friend at the time was a senior law draftsman for the Government of Jersey and he told me that they always drew up a law so there was an obscure escape hatch, in case they themselves ever got in a jam.A tweak or two here and there ruins one haven's advantage (and its economy) and opens up another in a different spot.In today's world you can move any amount of money from one jurisdiction to another at the click of a key, without a question being asked.And so this movie examines the spider's web with a touch of humour, a great deal of panache and a fairly good understanding of what goes on when things go south.Meryl Streep is very good in her role and Gary Oldman and Banderas are perfect as the amoral principals in Mossack/Fonseca.There's no such thing as ""just desserts"" in the world of offshore finance because hardly anyone ever loses. By the time the authorities get around to nailing someone, the money's been moved to another jurisdiction and they have to start all over again.Most people think that you can walk into a bank or law office in one of these places with a court order from the U.S. or Canada (or wherever) and that they will shrink in fear and give you the info you're looking for............. Think again!They just laugh at these orders, because they have no authority in foreign countries and they serve as an early warning system to their clients to move the money, tout de suite, to one of the other jurisdictions I just mentioned.
Think of a cat trying to catch a dot of light on the living room wall and you'll have a good understanding.A couple of things to remember about these jewels in the Caribbean or the Med or the English Channel;1) that the locals don't reap much of the benefits (apart from the few who are part of the game).I myself was paid peanuts for handling vast amounts of money, while the banks as entities made a king's ransom by way of service fees and trust administration charges. Those cheapskate banks still pay miserly wages to the front desk flunkies.2) Even if Governments DO manage to collect any money, you won't see a dime of reduction in your taxes, because they spend most of that money firstly in expenses collecting it, and secondly on programs trying to stamp it out.
It's like painting the Forth Bridge.So, very little of the fabulous sums actually stay where they are deposited and only a tiny, tiny fraction is spent on local economies, because the rich don't actually live there.
The money just bounces on the ground for a second and ends up either in London or New York, where Xanadu type homes are purchased in anonymous company names.Don't believe the headlines that tell us that it's being cleaned up, it's worse than it ever was.A very interesting, if depressing, movie, a million tax free times better than ""The Big Short"" enjoy.",The Laundromat

The parts were the movie was flatter were the ones in which there was Maryl Streep, except for her last appearance but it is so different than the other things she does in the movie. The biggest thing to know before watching this film is that it has a lot of technicalities about economy and, even if it's generally comprehensible, there are parts that are hard to follow if you don't have a strong base about economics. The good thing is that the message arrives, but maybe there can be some misunderstanding.

71,joker-4,A Struggle between a Documentary and an aloof Crime Caper,6,5 December 2019,"The trailer for The Laundromat is fun, slick, and even slightly irreverent. The promotion is bank-heist hip which Steven Soderbergh, director of the Ocean's 11 trilogy and the incredibly-awesome Logan Lucky, knows a thing or two about. Within that two-minute preview, Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas portray loveable buffoons with mockingly glorious accents, Meryl Streep is exasperated goodness, and an electro-funk score plays out the good times. The movie itself? Maybe the editing team for the trailer should have been given the reigns for the full release.Based on the anonymous leaks of the Panama Papers in 2016, The Laundromat features Oldman and Banderas - whose on-screen presence alone is the saving grace of the movie - as lawyers Mossack and Fonseca who narrate the film and speak to the concept and system of money laundering. Yeah, this is a heavy subject and Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns present the info in a series of semi-comedic vignettes similar to what Adam McKay did in The Big Short and, to a lesser extent, Vice. Whereas the education of the film works, the narrative breaks down quickly and frustratingly never resets.A bridging sequence focuses on Streep, who plays a widow seeking her justifiable settlement claim over her husband's (James Cromwell) accidental death. Streep's story is the driving focus. Her character of Ellen is charming and relatable and there isn't enough of her story. The film instead dives into tales of an African billionaire who is cheating on his family in multiple ways, a Chinese investor who seeks to break an illegal partnership with a British money launderer, and a polygamist insurance con artist. None of those asides are compelling and often ramble away with confusing conversations and plot points that are boring, unnecessary and detract from Ellen's quest of answers and, heaven forbid, justice. Justice, actually, does occur to a certain extent, yet not in a cinemagraphically compelling sense as the narrative is abandoned for word-for-word retelling of the facts.Soderbergh excels with complex, meaningful, and yes fun, storytelling. From Sex, Lies, and Videotape's Graham to Solaris' Chris, Soderbergh's characters often seek truth and redemption. Streep's Ellen is a worthy addition, but she never receives a proper pay-off. Neither does the film. Soderbergh almost seems to struggle between wanting to present a relative and convincing documentary yet slides into a goofy and aloof crime caper that is most wanting and where the ninety-five-minute run time is lightest of sentencing.",The Laundromat

It's strange because it has its sudden moments of action (the boat's sinking, the electrified dead of the Panama woman), because it doesn't follows per se a hero as most movies do (Meryl Streep's character is not really a hero, but a character used to show us the suffering of the average citizen), and because it throws in new characters that stop being important soon (like the rich, black man, David Schwimmer's character).

If you have half a brain and attention span and an interest in and memory of major international news events, it is an enjoyable raven-black comedy about a very serious matter.And yes: it does suddenly go very preachy at the very end, but successfully rams home its important message.It's also a treat for the eyes - beautifully directed by Steven Soderbergh and sly cameos from the likes of Sharon Stone, David Schwimmer, Matthias Scoenaerts, and a plethora of other favourites.I won't say any more in the event that you find an opportunity to view it.

There were too many narrative strands and loose ends that attempted to tell a larger picture of the gross corruption of the world's elite, but it just became disjointed and uninteresting. I never did figure out what was up with the African family whose dad was sleeping with the daughter's roommate? And then the Chinese thread? That was all real but only tenuously connected.

94,mauriciofernandogerhardt,"Different genre, bad acting, but worth watching, because...",10,9 November 2019,"The genre: The imdb page says: comedy/ drama/ crime. I'd say it's none of these. It's a mix of different genres: documentary, with short correlated vignettes, with political activism.
The story:
Basically, it tells you about an event that became big news, but didn't change:
Tax avoidance.
It tries to tell the audience through many points of view:
People who don't get their insurance paid, corrupt officials in China, cheating husband in Africa, the lawyers who help facilitate offshore companies.
There are 3 problems with this movie: acting, preaching, and mixing financial crimes with unrelated crimes.
Explaining:
The acting: The tone of banderas, makes him seem like he's trying to be sexy, but that doesn't have anything to do with the plot. Meryl streep plays 2 roles: One that looks like herself, and another with wig and prosthetics, but you can tell right away that it's her, so at the end when there's a big reveal that it's her, it's boring.
The preaching: If there's something Americans hate is being preached political views. And at the end of the movie, Meryl Streep takes her make up off and basically says: there's all this tax avoidance in place going on, politicians don't want to change this, because they need the money to get elected, so we should do something about it, and then she strikes a pose as if she was the statue of liberty. First: The statue of liberty has nothing to do with tax evasion. Second, if you want people to do something, tell them something that they could do, otherwise it's just depressing, or throwing the responsability to figure out onto the viewers. Also, it's completely out of tone with the rest of the movie.
The mixing of crimes: Through one of the vignettes, the movie mixes bearer bonds (not a crime), with infidelity (not a crime), with a legal bribe (not a crime), with other things. This is not the only one of these vignettes that suffers from this.
Bonus problem: Deus Ex Machina: There are at least 2 instances where a lot of extremely rare events had to happen in quick succession in order to get the plot forward. That's just lazy writing and offends my brain, as it doesn't follow logic.

To see how some of the various mechanisms of the fraud are structured, by making the fraudsters richer and the defrauded people poorer. As it would be seen how the defrauded people get ruined by these mechanisms, even they try, in all the way, to survive and get their money back. The filmmaker Steven Soderbergh has been intrigued by exploring the theme about fraud, by adapting the book Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers Investigation of Illicit Money Networks and the Global Elite by Jake Bernstein. After a long time of work and research, in 2019 came out The Laundromat by Steven Soderbergh with Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas. The movie's plot: Three different stories are involved, by having a bond, with the fraud mechanism of the Panama Papers, which are lead by a pair of law partners, Jürgen Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Ramón Fonseca (Antonio Banderas). The movie seems to start very well, by telling a serious subject, with some funny as well as emotional moments. Instead the movie takes this serious subject in the most incomplete way, to not let the audience have enough time, to understand the story nor to follow the characters. It would be understandable to write the screenplay, in the shortest and in the simplest ways, to explain such complicated subject. Even it does not justify the several issues the movie presents, especially for the way some of the chapters were not clear enough. Most of the cast, who played the main characters and the supporting ones, did have shown some interesting performances to get some values. Especially the characters played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, are some of the most interesting ones to follow, by seeing how they got so powerful to get then a heavy fall, at the end of the movie. Most of the defrauded characters had initially interesting aspects, for how they start until they will lately struggle, to get their money back and try to make sure everything is going to be hopefully fine. Even lately the narration's rhythm has been elaborated in a confused way, for how the defrauded characters are presented to be not enough convincing. By not giving enough time to the audience to understand the defrauded characters, especially in their psychological sides. The camera works to take some interesting shots, as well as with some interesting camera movements, to observe the direction of the story, from the beginning to the end. The editing has been elaborated in a way, by trying to be workable with some interesting rhythm. Even the editing does not save the movie at all, for the incomplete narration's rhythm and especially for not using enough materials to be told. The Laundromat is one of the most disappointing movies of 2019, which did not uses as much materials as it is needed to make the movie in the most complete way.",The Laundromat
99,Her-Excellency,"There is a reason why the attorneys at the center of the scandal this covers, wanted it banned.",10,20 October 2019,"The attorneys at the center of the scandal this covers, filed suit in federal court claiming they were defamed by the film. Upon viewing, you'll realize that there is no way they did not defame themselves.Above and beyond that, this is a film every single person who is unfamiliar with offshore banking should see. It describes in accurate, albeit humorous terms, how ""money"" works in some people's hands, vs. how it works in the hands of the normal Joe.The cast is made up of amazing actors who give amazing performances, yet as most of us know, that isn't always the ingredient for a great movie. This one went a step further, and gifted us with FACTS. (Not even its many detractors can argue with any conclusive proof that the laws it unveils to the layman are not on the books and being used daily).Basically, it takes the viewer through the inner machinations of a business run by people who know the law and push the law as far as the law will allow in order to serve their own purposes. People who deal in gauging the value of buying and selling trades and commodities, as easy as they gauge the value of .... and trade in ... other people.Lastly, in going through other reviews here, I can't help but think about how different we all are, and how some people understood and could appreciate such a well presented window into actual business practices and money and how the two affect the average American, and how others seemed to take simple facts, as a personal affront or attack on their political party.Not WANTING to face facts, does not change fact.",The Laundromat

101,MissCzarChasm,You Can't Handle The Truth,10,28 November 2019,"I would say that The Laundromat is a no-holds-barred look into the very REAL Panama Papers scandal, but that would be a lie, as it actually does hold back A LOT and does not delve deeply enough into detailing much of the corruption which ensued then, and which still exists today.For those unfamiliar with the ""Panama Papers"" scandal, in 2016, a whistle-blower released over 11 MILLION documents from the law firm Mossack & Fonseca (just ONE of the law firms involved in this kind of business), which detailed almost every aspect regarding the structure and practices of the shell companies which are used by some of the world's richest people in order to avoid paying taxes. This film, while presenting much of the story, fails to present all of it. One of the things the film did NOT cover, was what happened to journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who first broke the story.I believe that one of the reasons Soderbergh chose to not cover that part, and other equally disturbing aspects of the scandal, was that he wanted to present a film which would speak in almost lighthearted (if such a thing can even be done on this topic) and simplistic terms that most anyone could understand. As such, the film is presented as mostly comedy, which to me, is both unfortunate and genius. I mean, how best to swallow a bitter, but necessary pill, than to camouflage it with chocolate? While the chocolate in no way makes the pill less effective, it does help it go down easier. In the same manner, what was presented, although not complete, is in no way false. The only falsehoods, come from those who choose to lie to themselves, and to others, by thinking and propagating the thought that presenting these truths is somehow meant to demean them or their political party. These individuals should ask themselves: if your political party needs to be defended from simple truth, facts, data and documentation, how believable, honorable or strong is it to begin with?Lastly, I am not a ""shill"", I do not work for the film or anyone associated with it; I gain nothing from this or any other review; nor do I really care if anyone believes me. What I do care about is that due to emotional cry-baby attitudes and just plain ignorance, the truth is being silenced more and more, not just on IMDB, but across several platforms. I care that it is truly a tragedy, travesty and sin when ill-informed people CHOOSE to STAY ill-informed. I care about the absurdity of ill-informed people doubling-down and trying to manipulate ratings (such as is the case here) in order to try and sway other such people to also remain ill-informed. WHO in their right minds would choose misinformation for themselves when a vast plethora of information is readily available to us (now more than at any other time in the history of the world). When you think about it, choosing to remain uninformed seems almost unnatural in today's world. The term: ""educate yourselves"" should not be seen as an insult. This film does that, whether the viewer wants it or not.",The Laundromat

104,d_carlotaj,Don't Worry! I Clean It Up!,10,5 July 2020,"Money laundering is pervasive obviously. Dirty business. Not too long ago, the tv series ""Ozark"" appeared on Netflix, where in a small rural community in the Land of the Ozarks, a money laundering scheme is the main theme . So one would naturally assume that money laundering might be raised to an art on the world stage. And the movie ""The Laundromat"" shows us how the elite and the ruthless do it. ""The Laundromat,"" (2019). Director, Steven Soderbergh. Starring Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman, and Antonio Banderas. It looks like The Harvard University Corridor spits out graduates of the Schools of Finance, Business, and Law who are very clever and very creative. What do they create? Shells. Shells that provide privacy for tax evasion purposes. In reality, it was a big scandal which happened during the Obama administration. So what we have is a film which mirrors life...art imitating life.Meryl Streep plays the whistle blower. Oldman and Banderas provide the chorus which narrates the information for us to fill in the blanks. But the most interesting thing to me is the imagery in this film. The leitmotif running throughout the film is The Bible. We see a juxtaposition of churches, priests, and Catholicism and scenes in which the Ten Commandants are flouted and the criminal characters display contempt for the Seven Mortal Sins. The guilty are betrayed by our little ""John Doe"" Judas character, and they are condemned, and crucified. And buried. My hope is that they don't get resurrected. But after watching ""The Family,"" I can see that the future ruthless, soulless next generation of parasites are already installed on Capitol Hill and in training to become the future Robber Barons.""The Laundromat"" was a very good film. My favorite line? ""Don't worry! I clean it up!"" My favorite character is Maywood, played by Matthias Schoenaerts. His naivete is so genuine, and his death scene is too real! This film is a David and Goliath film. And little David wins. I loved this film. I give it five stars. It's on Netflix. Enjoy!",The Laundromat
105,michaeldoud,"First Hit: Confusing in presentation and often meandering away from the point, this movie fails in presenting how shell companies work to launder money.",2,25 October 2019,"First Hit: Confusing in presentation and often meandering away from the point, this movie fails in presenting how shell companies work to launder money and how it's hidden from governments.This film attempts to teach and engage the audience about the art of laundering money through a story of tragedy, charts and graphs, and humorous vignettes. It fails on all three fronts.Jurgen Mossack (Gary Oldman) and Ramon Fonseca (Antonio Banderas) are two flamboyant law partners based in Panama City who run a set of bogus insurance and reinsurance companies. These insurance companies scam others by taking their money, hide it, change documentation, and then legally never payout against the claims. They also have set up schemes of shell companies where money is hidden and moved around so that taxes are never paid on the money.The human life stories they use include Ellen and Joe Martin (Meryl Streep and James Cromwell, respectively) who are in retirement and decide to go on a lake tour boat. The boat capsizes because of a rogue wave, and Joe dies along with several others. Ellen, as one of the survivors, expects a class action financial settlement from the tour boat company's insurance company.However, Ellen's lawyer (Larry Clarke) discovers that the insurance company used by the boat tour company had sold the policy to someone else and that the timing issue means the boat company wasn't insured.The film spends a little time with the boat owner, Captain Paris (Robert Patrick), as he discovers from his employee Matthew Quirk (David Schwimmer) that he'd gotten a deal on the insurance, and that's why he selected this company. The payments were going to a shell company (postal box) on Nevis Island in the Caribbean that is run by Malchus Irvin Boncamper (Jeffrey Wright).
Ellen, who is mad as hell, traces the payment scheme and goes to Nevis, hoping to recover a settlement and discovers that the address is only a postal box.The film stupidly adds in stuff about how Boncamper has two families, one on Nevis and one in Miami. And he gets caught in this charade while being arrested in Miami by the federal government.The story also adds in other drama about a wealthy man, from Africa, living in the US having an affair with his daughter's college friend. Getting caught by the daughter, he bribes her to not tell her mother by giving her a company that's supposedly is worth $20M. Because of a previous indiscretion that his wife knew about, this man had also given his wife a company. Angry at the bribe and tired of his shenanigans, the wife and daughter head to Panama City to visit Mossack and Fonseca and cash in their stock.Of course, they discover that their companies are fake shell organizations, and the stock is worth nothing because the husband has transferred all the funds to his own companies.There are ill-timed and confusing graphics thrown into the mix while watching the story, and there are additional maudlin scenes of Ellen with her daughter and grandchildren in Las Vegas where Ellen and Joe had met. The whole Las Vegas segue could have been left out as it added little to the story.This film suffers significantly from the beginning moments with Mossack and Fonseca in contrived scenes with them talking to the camera and attempting to explain financial schemes in horrible accents that make it even more muddled.Streep is wasted and horribly underused in this story. Oldman is horrible. I've no idea of what he was attempting to represent because one moment he's sitting in a beach chair and the next he's pretending to be a lawyer using a perverse accent. Banderas was slightly better than Oldman, but not much. Wright was okay as the elusive representative of a fake insurance company. Schwimmer was OK as the relative and employee of the tour boat company that had looked to save them money on insurance premiums. There are nearly forty other actors playing roles in this story, but because the story is confusingly contrived, no one character is developed. Scott Z. Burns wrote a disastrous screenplay. Steven directed this, and it would have been interesting to better understand what was in his head. Because watching the screen, I was thrown from one ill-conceived scene to another while being interrupted with graphic explanations with poorly articulated voiceovers.Overall: I learned little to nothing about shell companies and tax avoidance because the stories thrown up on the screen were poorly conceived.",The Laundromat

Each one is a different angle on the issue at hand, from the perspectives of victims, perpetrators and recipient.

Those leaked documents that detailed how various people and companies created off-shore shell companies in order to avoid paying billions if not trillions in taxes around the world? No?I'm not surprised. It was a huge story that seemed to become a flash in the pan and many people forgot about it after the coverage dried up because, very likely, the corporations that run the news media tried to bury it. But these folks didn't forget.The film's title refers to the whole operation as generally being a money laundering scheme. Featuring an ensemble cast of Hollywood who's who as well as who's that, this Steven Soderbergh film invariably draws comparisons to Adam McKay's ""The Big Short,"" both in subject matter and style. The narrators, played by Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, frequently address the camera directly. Usually, this has the effect of making the audience feel like they're in on the scheme, but it's not as effective as when it was used in, say, ""House of Cards."" Why? I can't quite put my finger on it, but it likely has to do with the complexity of the scheme. Their characters are more than just narrators, but are actual players in the overall story, lawyers who created the paperwork and did the legwork to get these schemes off the ground. As such, they actually try to explain it, both simplified and with a certain complexity that leaves one a little unsure of the truth. Maybe that was the idea, but from a storytelling perspective, it didn't quite work.And effect is part of the problem with this film. Aside from being done as a comedy for what is in fact a very serious subject (the reporter who exposed this story was later killed by a car bomb), this film doesn't feel very effective in conveying outrage. In fact, it feels less like outrage and more like being impotently miffed. The film doesn't feel like it conveys the gravity of the situation. Which is very disappointing given the talent involved and the chance to really bring this subject back into the public eye. While I have to give the filmmakers credit with trying to make the complex money laundering scheme in the Panama Papers digestible to a general audience and keeping this visible, ultimately it feels like it's too little too late.",The Laundromat

Buying that yacht or Fifth Avenue penthouse condo is going to make the taxman wonder how you did that while making $6,500 a year.Enter the law firm of Mossack Fonseca. For a relative pittance, they will handle all the legal niceties and 'wash' your money. Through corporate structures that are too complicated to explain without a degree in larceny, ah, I mean corporate law, all your ill-gotten gains or pre-tax millions will miraculously become profits made legally. In simpler times, your local godfather would have started an olive oil importing business.A few years ago, an unknown person sent to the media a treasure trove of documents from the Mossack Fonseca firm. They revealed that a lot of very important people, Prime Ministers and Presidents, were clients who had engaged in these 'tax avoidance' schemes. It was all perfectly legal, like being a billionaire property developer who pays no taxes.Enter Steven Soderbergh and Scott Z. Burns who directed and wrote The Laundromat, a new Netflix movie based on this tale of how the rich get and stay rich - because make no mistake about it, if you didn't have to pay taxes, the average income owner in the US would retire a millionaire if she prudently invested her tax-free savings. As Harry Lime in The Third Man says, ""Tax-free, it's the only way to save money nowadays.""Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas play Mossack and Fonseca with pitch-perfect performances. The chameleon Meryl Streep does her usual magic and brings to life a victim of this new world shell game. There are many other characters as the story flows freely from continent to continent showing how it is done and how the law and the politicians who make the law are co-conspirators.Don't let any of this put you off - it is a funny, engaging movie that does have a polemical tinge to it, but then it is difficult to speak of these crimes without just a little outrage since, if you haven't figured it out yet, the taxes these modern reverse Robin Hoods are avoiding is your money.Sadly, the beat goes on. The money that drowns our political system in legal bribery will pay to keep the politicians right where they belong - in a pocket and it ain't yours. The scandals, like this one, will headline the news for a cycle or two and then get made into movies that nobody wants to watch as the victims of this system head to the nearest multiplex to watch Joker, fed on a steady diet of popcorn and marvel-ous circuses.

It was funny at times and it didn't go too far away from main subject and humor wasn't forced in any way.What made me sad is that these movie makers have to come up with creative ways just to get attention of audience.

There are some wonderful turns in the story.
I sat there completely glued to the screen, which I seldom do.
I think the next movie should touch on the slaves being made of our kids coming out of schools/universities with such incredible student loans and having to work, and compete for, jobs they don't want just to keep up with these loans! Meanwhile these universities own huge amounts of land and keep a surplus of over a billion dollars. I should write that script! Will this amazing team make that movie too?
Very well done! Thank you so much for making these issues so easy to understand in such a fun and entertaining way! Great writing and direction as well!",The Laundromat

Turning it into a comedy will allow many viewers to dismiss it as mere entertainment. And if it had to be a comedy, why such a cheesy comedy? Especially the very last 5 seconds of the film: beyond cheesy.The performances surprised me: Meryl Streep was terrible. Some director needs to tell her to stop doing the darting-eyes thing.

142,melinetto,Nice story with a great casting,7,24 January 2020,"The movie is depicted to the viewers through the eyes of Ramón Fonseca (Antonio Banderas) and Jürgen Mossack (Gary Oldman). The actors talk directly to the camera which is so helpful for us to understand the subject rightfully.The film is shown that multi-millionaires and multi-bilionaires create a bank account that is an offshore account which leads to pay less taxes. Mossack & Fonseca Co. which is a law firm and corporate service provider just can do that. Mossack & Fonseca Co. headquarters are in Panama and they can also help their clients about asset management.I just can say that the opening scene with ""bananas and cows"" is pretty funny and that scene also ensures what the movie is about and the subject. Ramón Fonseca and Jürgen Mossack speak directly to the camera in that specific scene which is so helpful for us to absorb the subject. Classy act by Steven Soderbergh. Ellen Martin (Meryl Streep) lost her husband in a boat cruise accident and after the accident, she didn't let go of the searching and that search leads her to Mossack & Fonseca.The topic is not for everyone because it's about insurance law basically. The film is based on true events and that just pull me back in. Panama Papers are about so many important people, contains 11.5 million data and are shown the actions of Mossack & Fonseca Co. for last 40 years. The script is quite successful even though the topic is hard and complicated. And i just wanna say that humour level is just right for a serious topic like this one. In generally, through the entire movie, humour level is just really good. Steven Soderbergh which is a class name, adapts the story like this clear enough. I like that the use of colors in a cinematographic way and the places in film can also help with that and it just fits the soul of the film.Meryl Streep, always hands-down, is just amazing. Meryl Streep and her acting skills in the closing scene that loads of satirical humour, put a smile on my face. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas are just absolutely amazing and they complete each other well enough. Also, Jeffrey Wright who plays Irvin Boncamper is just fits the role. Great casting.In summary, it's a very entertaining movie even though the serious story and i can say that the time is spent well.",The Laundromat

The Laundromat is a classic finance movie which became a popular genre after the 2007-2008 crisis and includes detailed description of how the Panama papers loophole unfolded and where the profit lies in such a crime. It doesn't difers much from the likes of Big Short, it employs the same documentarist tools to explain every necessary concept to the viewer, yet remains fun and entertaining. With stars like Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman there's no need for much depth either: the script is well laid out and the narrators can fill small gaps between scenes. Some may see the lack of character development as a bit of weakness, but the main problem is that they tried to skip it in a movie that also tries to focus on the social injustice side of the scandal. The final few cuts can't really help wrapping up 90 minutes of missing plot. We are presented the vague motives of each player in the scheme, but then all this is left hanging in the air. Still, if one is interested in how tax-havens work in a nutshell, the Laundromat is a recommended watch and the world definitely needs more similar productions.",The Laundromat

165,arx00,A Good-Willed But Amateur Film,5,24 December 2019,"I appreciate watching a film that aims to eliminate/reduce corruption. However, the reasoning of this film is flawed, incomplete and unfortunately makes a mess of the concepts through a populist approach.The concept of a limited liability entity is the fundamental cornerstone of our economic system and most corporate (as in commercial) entities are rooted upon this concept. The problem is not onshore or offshore entities but governmental supervision. If bankers, accountants, lawyers, auditors and back-office staff are required to detect and report fraud then they would, it is simple. If Panama or X Island(s) engage in fraud then this requires international sanctions. If they keep their taxes low or do not report to CRS, it is their right to do so.As offshore structuring is under attack, the laundromat is no longer a favored device. Things are now going for the worse and we are now witnessing the rise of the more dangerous ""oligark model"" where a small group of business people are safekeeping the wealth of political leaders and unlike offshore accounts that just try to be hidden, the oligark model is aggressive in terms of actively safekeeping itself publicly through manipulation of the media & elections. Does Streep and Sodenberg understand how dark things are becoming? No, for them this is a childish fairytale not because they are incompetant but that's just their limited vision and experience.It is rather funny when they put Meryl Streep in the church but fail to explain that the church itself often pays no taxes and I remember reading an article about how Vatican, despite being a religious entity incorporated as a sovereign state, used extremely complex structures to hide off its enormous wealth.One thing this film says accurately is that the US is the number one tax haven in the world. But this has little to do with DL but with the deeply rooted cultural traditions that a person's property is their property and is not to be messed (taxed) with.I understand people have high expectations and wish this film to do some good.

173,WilliamofTexas,Pot-Kettle?,2,20 October 2019,"Warning- Contains spoilers and opinionsWell, let me mark my Nobel ballot ""no"" for Merle Streep to win a Nobel Peace Prize for this thinly disguised, poorly researched drama about a woman who loses her husband in a boating accident and how the big, bad insurance companies and bankers cheated her out of a settlement.After finding out from her Las Vegas realtor that her down payment check on a Strip-facing penthouse is ISF, she doggedly seeks answers then revenge by traveling extensively on her husband's ""meager"" retirement funds. She even resorts to wearing a disguise while living and working illegally in Panama for the dastardly bankers who formed the shell companies that stole her settlement money. The disguise, by the way, is at least to my eyes, so amateurish that even my 2-year old grandson would have spotted it in a second.Why do I take exception to this piece of nonsense? Let's begin with the ""crime"" itself. The lake excursion boat is struck by a rogue wave, perhaps caused by a rogue supertanker that somehow got into the lake thru an unsupervised lock. The boat flips and over half the people drown without so much as a single stroke of the arm. We are additionally treated to a full face look at Streep as others drown and she stares into the camera. Could you at least help one person, Merle? BTW- her makeup artist should have been fired after seeing the dailies but that is not my field of expertise.Sometime later, Streep meets with her lawyer (because we all have one on retainer) and he tells her the bad news- no money from the giant insurance company but, hey, your dead husband left you comfortable. Take a trip. Treat yourself. Buy a Las Vegas penthouse like the rest of us would have done with our money.Here's the thing- there is no giant insurance company dumb enough to write a liability policy on a clearly unsafe excursion boat that is so easily swamped by a rogue lake wave from that super tanker that we spoke of earlier. No life jackets floating around either? It's going to be a Lloyd's specialty underwriter and it's going to be pricey. But let's continue.Somehow it is discovered that the mean bankers have placed the liability policy with a ""shell"" company in the Caribbean. They really hammer the word ""shell"" as if they've decoded a Sanskrit manuscript. Eyebrows are launched, mouthed twisted and Streep climbs aboard a plane and heads to the Caribbean island where it is revealed that a man and his secretary do nothing but sign documents for ""shell"" companies created by the mean bankers in Panama.Somehow, superwoman Streep manages to uncover the Caribbean bad guys second family in Miami and gets him arrested, too. Then she jets off to Panama where she promptly breaks the law by disguising herself, obtains employment under false pretenses and identity and outs the bad guys there, too.In between, the movie shows how some African millionaire cheats his wife and daughter out of money they accepted as bribes from him in the first place! If I cared, I'd go back and research this part of the movie to see if Streep somehow disguised herself and infiltrated the family as an African American.In the end, all the baddies get what they have coming and Streep, still dressed as the illegal Panamanian bank employee, breaks the fourth wall and begins pulling off wigs and make-up as she explains how all this kind of business happens all the time and we must be vigilant and pursue the truth or something. Sorry, I got lost at the end when she begins brushing her real hair, fluffing it up as she explains all this to us. So called ""shell"" companies are an epidemic and rotten bankers as common as sea shells on a Panamanian beach and this kind of fraud takes place all the time. Blah blah blah.Look- let's consider that Hollywood wouldn't exist without shady business practices, financial fraud and shell companies. Ask any performance bond company who they're owned by and they'll hit you with a restraining order faster than you can say OJ Simpson. Most performance bond companies are either wholly or partially owned by the studios. The studios purchase performance bonds (or it might be called a completion bond) to insure that a movie or TV show makes enough money in profits to show up as black ink in their accountants books (one of the sets). If the movie tanks and/or it goes straight to DVD, the studio pays themselves for their failure. Next time the credits roll on a big time movie, pause it towards the end of the credits and make note of the companies that pay salaries, insure the production, the accounting firms and then Google them. How many are subsidiaries of the studios? How many are registered in states with liberal incorporation laws like Delaware, Wyoming.... the very states that Banderas and Oldham name in their clever narrative thru-out the movie.If you wonder about what actors and directors do when they aren't working on a movie or TV show, they sometimes form production companies. They have actual offices, hire staff and look over whatever scripts or other ""projects"" come their way. They log time, pay staff and when tax time comes, they claim loses on their taxes because they didn't produce anything profitable. (There are those who do make a profit)Wait- what about those shell companies Merle was pouting about? Well, those are formed when actors like Streep get paid $14 million dollars to perform. She probably nets about 1/4 of that salary in real money from which she pays her agent, management company, staff at her offices and they rest go into investments here and overseas where no or little taxes are paid. That's not illegal, by the way. But it is something only the wealthy can do.So, to have Streep, Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman, all millionaires, take part in a movie taking aim at banking practices and shell companies on behalf of us poor peons who don't understand such complicated issues is insulting and galling. Of all the places to produce a movie about illegal activities in banking, insurance and accounting- Hollywood, land of accounting practices that would make your brain explode!It is simply a matter of the pot calling the kettle black.",The Laundromat

The movie is done in a sort of comical way, but is based on facts found in the Panama Papers exposed by a whistleblower...and what's depicted is all true.

191,francobulgheoz,"Just, nuh.",4,21 October 2019,"The Laundromat may be a funny movie at times, but not a worthy one if you are seeking comedy. Connections to the economic world made noise to me. The film did'nt seem to be going anywhere during many times.Steven Soderbergh is a director I find to be crucifyingly irregular. I think he chooses many projects that vary drastically in styles and executions and that does not allow for a definite personality in direction.Breaking the fourth wall has gone to far. So far indeed, one could already imagine Mossack and Fonseca walking out of prison into the shooting set.I think cinematography is a tricky piece of this film. Though many beautiful places are shown in the movie, I find several takes to be over exposed and what I would consider as unnecesary framings. Editing did not help for it, I believe setting shifts did not come with harmony and perhaps some atmospheres were swept away for another just as soon as you began to feel involved.The story is based on true events and that does allow to bring the focus to other areas, but I did not like the way it was written. Links between characters are too weak along all the film, having only liked the one at the final scene. I think having a story that connected branches from all over the world ended as a challenge for the project.Meryl Streep did alright. Her performance improved as the film went on. Gary Oldman is up to much bigger things, I believe. This project I see as a stain in his broad career. Antonio Banderas, I just can never believe him. Don't know why.The length of the film is too short, thankfully. Many minutes are wasted in extra long scenes that can be much more powerful in shorter and quicker rising action, though this all relies on the director's intention. Every moment of the film that is supposed to reveal tension has failed to do so in my case. I felt no empathy, no admiration nor dislike towards any character.Finally, I believe this movie had potential which was poorly exploited.

203,rfb0650,How to make a comedy of true crime -- and fail miserably,3,28 December 2019,"The Laundromat is a movie about a serious subject -- money laundering and the Panama Papers scandal. Some of Hollywood's best star in the movie: Banderas, Oldman, Sharon Stone, Streep. For some reason, the makers decided to try to make it a comedy, and to also throw in a morality play. The result is a horrible mishmash that fails.The introduction consists of barely intelligible into-the-camera monologues, which is snarky and sarcastic -- a poor substitute for humor. Along the way, the movie becomes preachy about corporate tax havens and Streep tells us that the way out is campaign finance reform.But they get most of the facts wrong, and they don't seem to understand the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Which may be the reason they tried to make it a comedy. If the producers and writers and actors were all involved in tax havens -- they admit as much in the movie -- then why would they want to make a serious movie calling out the issues? Easier to say ""reform"" is needed. That way, they have no responsibility and can blame the ""system"" for their own shortcomings.",The Laundromat

If you lower taxes and thereby retain businesses, you will also retain your regulatory power over them.

A movie/docu-drama that tries so hard to examine the problem of financial inequality but ends up coming across as pretentious twaddle. Poorly constructed from start to finish. The Big Short comparisons that many other reviewers are obvious but this fails to match that standard by some distance. The BS was sharp, punchy and comprehensive. In contrast, Laundromat is uneven and unfunny; as far as I could tell it's just a vehicle for the guilt of the hollywood liberal elite. It's akin to Michael Moore at his worst. Actually, maybe that's a little harsh but it's still a legit comparison.Starts off promising enough but the various segments don't tie together coherently and by the end any message that it's trying to get across gets lost in the muddle. While it highlights an obvious problem there's no sense that it's trying to inspire a meaningful solution - not that there's any obligation on the film makers to provide one, but if you're going to try and inspire change, then your message to be mapped out properly. This clearly isn't. Oh and while Meryl Streep is a fine actress she is also terribly patronising.

244,dcalaproductions,"Steven Soderbergh's Fast-Paced Financial Dramedy ""The Laundromat"" Is Hugely Entertaining",8,27 October 2019,"Collaborating with veteran scribe Scott Z. Burns for the fourth consecutive time, director Steven Soderbergh mines well-crafted narrative territory and comedy-drama tones with a series of vignettes that are both engaging and intricate in terms of research, subject matter and execution. At a trim 90 minutes, the film unfolds briskly while constructing a bracing satire about the corrupt financial institutions and industries that are not only present in the United States but in other allied developed countries as well. With scenery-chewing narration provided by a compulsively watchable Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas and with a stacked cast that also includes Meryl Streep, Jeffrey Wright, Robert Patrick and James Cromwell, the movie successfully makes pointed observations and illuminates the viewer with startling facts about corporate/capital power-shifting. Progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have rallied against these power-players for the duration of their legislative careers would find these nuggets disturbing.This film's lean script is the movie's ace in the hole with a relatable, and welcomingly pedestrian nuance that makes the lofty finance-talk throughout digestible to the average viewer. Soderbergh's nimble, roving camera with colorful inserts and transitions mixed with sight-gags are plentiful here and mesh well with the outsized performances from every actor including minor supporting roles. Stunningly, the comedic tone of the movie doesn't overshadow the stakes by making them any less important as Burns works especially hard at making certain characters sympathetic and most very three-dimensional. Tonally, this movie is the closest to Soderbergh's and Burns's first team-up, the 2009 Matt Damon-starrer The Informant!, while improving on the former film by leaps and bounds. At this point, it is hard to believe that a short time ago Soderbergh was considering retiring from filmmaking altogether. If this movie is any indication, he still has plenty of stimulating stories to tell.",The Laundromat

We hear about shell companies like that is the reason for fraud, and then the big takeaway is states that don't charge enough taxes. What???? If people were pretending to be an insurance agency fraudulently, then that is the problem, and it's already illegal. If the show was supposed to teach us something more about how shell companies hide fraud, then they failed. It came across as incoherent and somewhat preachy film by people you know are using these shell companies.

It's clear Soderbergh lifted a page or two from The Big Short (2015), but narrative style is not enough to drive a film without narrative structure.The film attempts to follow Ellen (Meryl Streep) as she tracks down the parties responsible for not paying out on her lawsuit, but the conflict is non-existent, and our protagonist solves mysteries by bumbling around Mr. Magoo style. She just happens to show up in the right place at the right time in at least three instances.In lieu of rewrites and reshoots, (hey, Ms Streep is a busy lady) the producers seemingly decided to obfuscate the poor narrative by injecting 10-15 minute shorts about unrelated characters that lead nowhere.As Antonio Banderas will tell you, this film is all a shell game.",The Laundromat

They say at the beginning that it is a fairy tale, but I would say it's a modern moral tale, in the vain of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. You have multiple story lines, of various tones and you get resolution
Don't expect a dark gritty film. This is a satire. It reflects upon the present condition of the human race and as we are in the middle of all this, most don't recognize what's happening to us. The film may not be dark, but it does shed light on dark places that the majority of us don't want to think about.

You could tell it was Streep right away. There is also a mishmash of short stories strung together with people you'll never care about throughout the entire film. I almost turned it off a few times but I stayed til the end and it was not worth it. Not only did the end ""explain"" what we just witnessed but it had a strange monologue by Streep as herself to prove a point about corruption; which felt out of place, preachy and pretentious.

This film didn't and seems completely unaware of it; because not only was it not done well, it was overdone.
The film wants to be clever - wants to make you think & make you angry at the evil practices of businessmen and politicians - but it stays with the intention, I never felt a thing. A white lady can't have the exact apartment she wants? Buhuuu. I'm sorry, but think about it. Of all the scenarios that stem from the 1% ""having it all""?
Overall, the film to me feels very ""Hollywood patting itself on the back""; Oh, aren't billionaires just the worst, when will us regular people share the wealth, what has soceity come to?! It is a relevant message for sure, but coming from a pack of A-listers (in the style that they chose to do it) feels disingenuous and cringy. It wasn't funny, it wasn't emotional, it wasn't clever.

However, the complexities of global finance are brought to surprisingly understandable proportions by using the two narrators as guides.When at the end the film steps out of character, in a manner of speaking, it felt logical to me.

The set up was good. A woman is involved in a horrible tour boat accident that claims the life of her husband. It is then revealed that she is being cheated out of the insurance money she rightfully deserves due to corrupt business practices.
This leads her to uncover how our finance laws are completely biased to benefit the rich and corrupt.Seems like a great plot. But it falls apart rather quickly. It begins to intersect with other stories to try to explain how shell companies, biased tax laws and corruption affect all of us. But it just creates a mess. 40 minutes into the film, my wife and I looked at each other and exclaimed ""I have no idea what's going on right now"".There's even a point in the film where Streep's character is trying to explain what's going on to a reporter and the reporter keeps interrupting her to tell her she is confused and doesn't understand. Streep's character becomes frustrated and we both sat on our couch and began to laugh. We felt like the reporter completely lost.In the end the message is very important we need finance laws to be reformed and justice is needed for the victims of the Panama Papers crimes.

Not the people who leaked it but the people who were exposed. Law firms and offshore companies and people (lawyers and money launderers) behind them. And stories of people affected because of the actions of these firms.This movie will always be compared to The Big Short. It has almost the same style. It has that 4th wall break like The Big Short with main characters explaining what's going on and how things work (which is still a little hard to comprehend).Acting is top-notch. Gary Oldman is amazing as always as he plays 'zee' German 'Jürgen Mossack'. First movie I've watched of Antonio Banderas and Meryl Streep. Both were great in their roles.Music was good.Cinematography was alright.Writing was very good.Just the execution and the presentation were ok.Overall, a good film led by a great cast with not so good execution/presentation.

This is rich coming from an industry that routinely cuts corners when it comes to tax incentives. I've worked on hollywood sets before because in order for them to get the state tax incentive they have to hire a certain number of local crew. Hollywood is just as keen to get their tax breaks as any of the individuals talked about in this film.I've never seen Oldman in a part where he looks like a high school drama actor trying out Hamlet for the first time, but I have now.If you like films where Hollywood lecture you about how evil the United States is, and how the United States is the source of all these financial issues, this is the film for you.

It takes the pretty complicated Panama papers scandal and explains it in a simple way to an audience that is not an economy or politic expert. It's smart, funny, and informative at the same time.But it's structured in a way that might be surprising for some of us: it's a non-linear fictional documentary with a satirical and humoristic touch in it. Once you acknowledge that, it's easier to accept Soderberg's presentation, I think.Also, something about the unrealistic style reminds me of Bertolt Brecht's theater. For example, the lawyers break the fourth wall and face the camera, the set and costumes are clearly fake, Mossack talks with an exaggerated accent, etc. Thus, we feel we are here to be instructed first: Soderberg wants to show us what the 1% is doing with our money behind the scenes and makes us think about it. It may not be for everyone's taste, but the humor helps to ""swallow the medicine,"" as Oldman said in an interview.My only complaint is that the pace is SOMETIMES a bit slower than I thought. I think some scenes would have been more engaging if it had some music in it, or more ""punchy lines.""As for the acting, the main cast does a superb job. Meryl Streep plays her role with dignity and is credible. But my favorites performances come from Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas: what a great comedic timing they have! We can feel their on-screen chemistry, and that makes them a perfect comical duet.Overall, I found the movie pretty exciting and give it 8.5* (I rated it 10* to increase the score that is too low, IMO.)",The Laundromat

Gary Oldman mastered a French, German, English and South African fusion accent putting in one of the poorest performances I've seen on screen.What a total embarrassment of a film.

The Soderbergh name, along with the amazing cast is why I wanted to see this movie, and star power might be the reason why the early reviews are so positive. Or, maybe I'm missing something.

So much effort is required of the audience to follow what's going on. Not because the subject matter is complicated, but because the film needs a plot and can't find one, while the script is a weird mix between drivel and self-indulgence.
The style is basically a knock-off of The Big Short, but instead of making unfamiliar subject matter and jargon accessible and comedic, it reduces two brilliant actors into cringe-inducing clowns, bridging scenes that didn't serve a purpose with narration monologues that didn't serve a purpose. Other characters appear and disappear without leaving any emotional impression on the audience, leaving us with a pile of film shorts that gets rammed together like misfitting jigsaw pieces.
I'm driven to write this, because I cannot stand a filmmaker that neglects the two fundamentals of storytelling. Character and plot. Filmmaking is storytelling. The themes and meaning of a film, and the thoughts and feelings of the moviegoer come out of those two things. Not the other way round. If you want to write an essay for a high school newspaper then do so, don't make a lazy cartoon about rich people being evil, and eating babies and trying to reduce the world population by 90% (or whatever it is they do at the weekend). There is an agenda here, or a message, but it's so incoherent that it actually requires Meryl Streep, in the final scene, to break character and explain to the audience what on earth they are supposed to be watching.

We started to bail several times, but kept thinking ""this has to start making sense at some point"" but it simply never does.

It gives the viewer a real backstory and understanding of what actually happened when we saw the Panama Papers in the news, how it came to be and the wider repercussions. Where it fell down, however, was in being a film. The narrative whilst easy to follow does not make for easy watching. Oldman and Banderas act as narrators but spend too much time narrating and not enough time letting the narrative flow into any kind of film. The breaking off the fourth wall is used so excessively that you are not sure if it is a film about Oldman and Banderas alone or if there is a story somewhere in there too. While their characters are central to the plot, the constant scenes with them actually take the viewer focus away from the plot and on the pair of them with Oldman's accent being hard to stomach.

In retrospect, it's better to consider it a series of vignettes rather than a coherent story, but there is not enough creativity or clear enough signal as you're watching the movie that, actually, Meryl Streep is just one in an ensemble (she's alone on the poster!) It closes out with one of the more bizarre sequences in recent memory, as a bumbling Hispanic secretary is revealed to have been the informant for which they were searching, and also Meryl Streep. Streep then proceeds to stroll across a soundstage and give us a lecture on campaign finance.To cap it off, their breakdown of the American tax system is blatantly factually incorrect.

There are a couple humorous moments, almost all near the beginning to suck you in... but in the strong desire to wag fingers about their axe to grind of the day, they can't sustain anything clever or coherent.It starts out with ""lessons"" on money, and ""secrets"" - the first couple are decent but then it meanders almost with no purpose. is this about offshore accounts? shell corps? is it tax havens or refused insurance claims? foreigners buying property and cutting out citizens? bearer bonds and how to use them for bribery? Chinese intelligence harvesting Falun Gong organs? NO - at the very end, Meryl Streep literally strips off her costume and ends with a pose of the statue of liberty demanding campaign finance reform - I guess that was the theme all along.... but then the credits include a line about companies who paid no income tax on their earnings...?They also spend a good amount of time on the time-honored tradition of fetishizing rich people bad; poor people good. Through some unbelievably bad dialogue we are told what a good, normal person Streep's husband was. he paid his taxes and loved his family, so you know, he is the good guy. Its complete with the virtuous woman monologues to some kids about meeting him that they pay rapt attention to and laugh at stories that 5 year olds wouldn't care a wit about. And those rich guys??? My god, philandering, dissing their kids, and look at how absurd they dress and talk! Thats how you know they are baaaad.Speaking of bad, at some point the dialogue also includes such realistic lines as ""but if you don't open my empty shell corporation, I can't buy my tenth house in the French Riviera!"" Get it? That's how you know these are evil people! No mistaking those kinds of conversations that the 1% have all the time...This is about as subtle as a 13 year old who just took his first social studies course from a teacher who used to be a ""community activist"" and realized eventually she would need an actual paycheck. After all the ranting and raving under the guise of an education, the 13 year old's deep thoughts of how ""its all connected, maaan"" are formed into this script.Talk about ham-fisted. There are so many concepts and themes here that deserve some deeper exposure and thought, and many I would implicitly agree with. But I can't bring myself to like a movie just because it strokes my pre-existing notions of the world. Even a modicum of causing you to double take or rethink what was developing in the movie might have caused me to think and act.

Thanks to my English homework I watched it yesterday! What I loved most about this movie? Definitely Meryl Streep's part. She is fascinating even being awfully dressed (I hope intentionally, compared to ""The Devil Wears Prada""). Actually I enjoyed the all-star cast. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas looked charming and wonderful despite their unscrupulous manoeuvres. David Schwimmer and Melissa Rauch left an impression of an ostensible crazy crossover. (Yes, I am the person who knows them only due to ""Friends"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" and these associations are very strong.)
The second thing which impressed me (after all the famous actors involved in one movie) was visualization. Cameramen and designers' work was a great success. The majority of images were thoughtfully constructed and sufficient amount of attention to detail was paid. Every scenery (even those which looked more like artificial stage backgrounds) persuasively reflected the characters' emotions, take for instance the beach scene where relaxed Mossack tells us his life story sitting on a bench with a white-blue tent and some sophisticated elements or the final one where Meryl Streep turns from the employee from Mossack Fonseca into the main character and then into herself resembling the Statue of Liberty with a hairbrush instead of a torch.
Speaking about the purpose of the movie I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. Definitely it was not a documentary but even as a feature film it had an avenue for being more informative and specific. It didn't provide us an insight into the process of revealing sensitive information. The whistleblower wasn't shown neither as a confident and brave person nor as a person trying to shy away from the necessity to expose wrongdoing. (Actually the whistleblower was not shown explicitly and the viewer can only make assumptions.) The main character wanted to sound the alarm but the whole story didn't seem to support her endeavour. Negative characters were romanticized: Mossack and Fonseca were being too charismatic. The numerous stories about dark sizes of Mossack Fonseca's clients overrode the idea of global unfairness and injustice provided both by legislation and those companies similar to Mossack Fonseca.",The Laundromat

Now I started to understand them, and after watching them, I realize what a huge world of finance is.I like movies that break the fourth wall and start interacting with the audience. However, most of these comedy films are 18+. And Laundromat's director also placed a stronger emphasis to the fourth wall and becomes an explanatory comedy to simplify the perception of the vast majority viewers (like me 5 years ago). To this type, you can also add ""The Big Short"", which describes the crisis and working with CDS.The film is based on one tragic circumstances, in which the protagonist tries to achieve justice and investigate the reasons why shells are difficult by diving deeper and deeper, thus showing us different speculative situations that you have encountered yourself or at least heard about them.The duet of Banderas and Oldman with a funny accent becomes the main an incentive(attraction) of the ""Laundromat"" - their witty monologues add up to a funny lecture about the silly complexity of financial systems. Therefore, the ""Laundromat"" is divided into several episodes, where various methods of tax evasion are revealed to us, but the message of each of them is clear - such frauds do not bring anything good to anyone in the end. Of course, we all accept the intelligence and education of such, with your permission, an idiosyncratic businessman, but they do not cause respect.Film critics took a poll among film critics and the results showed us the low rating. Despite the low ratings, the film is of some interest, but it may seem boring to some viewers, incomprehensible to others, and too comical to others, at a time when such a painful topic as the enrichment of already rich people at the expense of dubious zones called shells was touched upon.",The Laundromat

354,meiliyingfilm,"Good film, but PLEASE get the Chinese language right",7,19 November 2019,"The film itself is great. We definitely need more films like this rather than just popcorn entertainment. It's very educational and has a great point. The bold cinematic forms are inspiring too.But PLEASE, please get the Chinese language right. It's already the year of 2019, and it's almost absurd for me to see that every Chinese character in every single English language film can't speak Chinese.I'm not even talking about the accent. Some of these actors are Chinese Americans who grew up without learning Chinese, and their native language is English. Some speak Cantonese, which is completely different from Mandarin. The only actor in this film that can speak Mandarin is 'Bo Xilai.'When the language is so broken and child-like, it's really hard to believe in their characters, and it kills the scene. So please, please, please. Pay more attention to this. ADR the scene, find an assistant casting director that understands the language, cast uprising Mandarin-speaking actors, hire a language coach...there are a million ways to make it work if you just try a little harder.",The Laundromat

357,zt-88686,Never Touch It,1,18 February 2020,Literally a piece of crap. Too messy and not sure what the director wants to say! Trash Chinese? Or a political campaign? Cannot believe all the big stars joining in this movie. It is literally just garbage,The Laundromat
358,cafox,The ending makes it worth it!,10,22 October 2019,The Laundromat gets a little wonky on corruption but turns you into a manchurian candidate for good at the end.If you care about yourself or your family you might want to watch this movie and try to understand what's at stake here.I'd liken this to taking a vaccine for the good of society as a whole... only more important.,The Laundromat
359,martinmatthews-00245,Missed Opportunity.,3,17 December 2019,"I'm not sure what the point of this film was. The way it jumps around between random unrelated stories, except being linked to the Panama Papers feels like a missed opportunity. I'm sure the Panama Papers would give rise to some cracking scripts if you focus on one story and go into a bit of depth (one that is meaningful). I can't help but feel this is trying to be the Wolf of Wall Street with the characters talking directly to camera but that German accent by Gary Oldman just doesn't do it for me.The film takes a bizarre turn right at the end when Meryl Streep goes into a monologue, starting as a one of the character's she plays, taking off the wig and fake nose to go into the second character she plays, when finally she takes off that character's wig and ends the monologue playing herself in an empty film set.",The Laundromat
360,tabonneville,Documentary by rich Hollywood disguised as a movie,1,30 January 2020,"Just sorry I sat through the whole thing only to hear Meryl Streep lecture about political campaign corruption. Hollywood knows nothing BUT corruption and they're duping people into thinking this is a ""fun comedy"". Always an agenda.",The Laundromat
361,paulaterraneale,"Watch it, it is a Sondenberg film on Netflix now",10,22 October 2019,"I recommend it,it has a top billed cast, including Antonio Banderas and Merryl Strip amongst other excellent actors.
It is a bit on the silly side but the theme is hot, the evasion of money to the paradise fiscals, and is the perfect antidote to the Joker, who is heavy and anguishing. This is silly but can be taking seriously, it is a Sondenbetg and has been nominated to Vennice",The Laundromat
362,kirstennaomi,Laundronot,2,7 November 2019,"The film started of okay. It seemed like the main characters storyline it started of with, was worth watching. Also there were some funny moments.
But throughout the film they totally lost me.
The main characters storyline faded to the background and a lot of supporting characters storylines began. It became very boring to watch and to me the film lost it's meaning.
After an hour of watching, it felt like I was watching for two hours. But there was still half an hour to go. Most of the time when I'm already an hour through the film, I cannot bring myself to stop watching. But with this film, I did.",The Laundromat

365,jkbaue,"Funny, entertaining, but...",5,21 October 2019,"...who wants to be preached to, harangued, and shamed for an hour and 34 minutes by such luminaries MerylStreep, Antonio Banderas, and Gary Oldman? (All turn in delightful performances, and it took me the whole show to identify one of Miss Streep's hilarious characters. There's no dispute that these aforementioned actors are supreme in their craft).
If your net worth is under a million dollars, don't bother. If you don't need offshore accounts to evade U.S. taxes, skip it. This is a diatribe against the Rich by the Rich. Tune in to whatever show makes you laugh or cry. But if you're curious how the top 2000 billionaires live, go ahead and enjoy it",The Laundromat
366,thorntonrichard,Very boring nonsense.,1,9 February 2020,"The story springs from a tragic boating accident, leaving 21 deaths. A family survivor tries to find out why her insurance claim has no value beyond a piece of paper. Its stupid on many levels: 1) The original defendant, the boat owner had a crap policy thus his fault. 2) Why all the dumb plot twists, and gratuitous violence?Is this the best Streep can do now? This type of moronic crap? Throw this movie in the trash.",The Laundromat
