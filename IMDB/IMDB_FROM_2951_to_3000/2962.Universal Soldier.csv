0,Leofwine_draca,"It may be a popcorn movie, but it's a well made one",7,24 November 2016,"Big, dumb, loud, and fun. Four words that could aptly summarise the appeal of this blockbuster movie which proved a hit with audiences back in '92 and spawned three inferior sequels. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is probably Van Damme's most successful mainstream movie to date and his pairing with Lundgren as the enemy is a good one; Lundgren's height alone gives him the imposing edge over the smaller, tougher Van Damme and their final one-on-one battle is one to remember. Packed with lots of hard-edged violence and some unwanted comic relief from a highly annoying female support (Ally Walker), UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is a movie that gets better as it goes along.At first, the sheer woodenness of Van Damme and Lundgren is inexcusable. I know that they're supposed to be playing emotionless dead robots, but even after they first rebel they seem wooden and unable to even say their lines convincingly. Thankfully this wears off as time goes on and the pair settle down into their roles. In fact Lundgren goes a 360-degree turnaround at the end and actually becomes quite good as the psychotic soldier who believes that he's surrounded by the enemy. Van Damme? Well, here he plays a more sympathetic character than usual which will no doubt endear him to female fans, while still providing the high-kicking action that the fans expect. Ally Walker is terrible, though, as the intensely annoying female lead, and although it's good to see Ed O'Ross make an appearance as a colonel, he's underused and killed off quickly.The flimsy plot strings together a scene of big-budget action sequences (no surprise, as most of Roland Emmerich's films are thus styled, e.g. INDEPENDENCE DAY) which are pretty impressive. From the opening hostage stakeout at the Hoover Dam to the shoot-up at a motel, to the climatic truck chase and the final battle with Van Damme and Lundgren, things just keep getting better and better. The high body count sees lots of people getting shot or killed in nasty ways, and of course there's the usual quota of bullet-shedding and big explosions.Lundgren's method of death at the end of the movie (like you couldn't guess) is highly graphic and unexpected. The loud score is sufficiently adrenaline-pumping to work and the film tries so hard to please that the feeling rubs off on the audience. Although it may be dumb entertainment, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER ""delivers the groceries"" so to speak and is quite watchable in a forgettable way, in that it passes the time and engages the attention but doesn't leave much impact afterwards. It may be a popcorn movie but it's undoubtedly a well-made one.",Universal Soldier
1,SnoopyStyle,excellent action B-movie,7,2 February 2016,"During the Vietnam war, Private Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) tries to stop Sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) who has gone mad. It ends in a massacre and the military tries to cover it up. Their dead bodies are used in a secret experiment. In the present day, Colonel Perry commands these Universal Soldiers in a rescue mission when terrorists take 30 hostages. Reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) follows the team back to their base. The soldiers start experiencing traumatic recalls and Scott goes crazy once again. Deveraux saves Veronica and goes on the run.This introduced me to director Roland Emmerich. This is a simple action thriller and it's fun. The story works. It's not complicated. Sure, it has that Terminator flavor but that's a good thing. This uses Van Damme and Lundgren to their best possible side. It lets them be a little bit robotic. It's an excellent action B-movie.",Universal Soldier
2,classicsoncall,"""My tour's up. Just want to go home"".",7,6 August 2016,"Right around the time this movie came out in 1992 Image Comics was forming, and it wouldn't surprise me if any number of their titles were influenced by ""Universal Soldier"". I'm thinking of books like 'Youngblood' and 'Brigade', having team members that were mechanically or biologically enhanced for super-human strength and endurance.The psychobabble reason offered for the Unisols had to do with hyper accelerating the bodies of dead people back to a state of living tissue. To my thinking, dead is dead, so the concept didn't really make sense to me, but I did like Dr. Gregor's (Jerry Orbach) explanation of 'regressive traumatic recall' as the trauma inflicted at the time of death. What might have helped here would have been to get some of the old time horror film scientists on board with a workable premise, guys like Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff or Lionel Atwill. They would have come up with something brilliant.Fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren ought to have a pretty good time with this one if all you're looking for is some mindless, escapist and over the top action. It appeared Pepsi went for the big bucks to shut out Coca-Cola for product placement in the film, their logo was all over the place. Watching this back in the Nineties would have put the viewer right smack dab in the middle of the Now Generation.What I got a kick out of were the subtle attempts at humor like the diner breakfast scene and Ronnie Roberts (Ally Walker) giving GR44 (Van Damme) the once over looking for a small hidden object. Hint - it's probably something hard.Well look, it's not brain science or rocket surgery, but the picture moves along at a pretty good clip, and even the odds defying elements of the story have their place. If after watching you come away dissatisfied, I guess you could settle into one of those specially rigged lab chairs and grab a shot of that memory clearance formula. Sounds like it would do just the trick.",Universal Soldier
3,jboothmillard,Universal Soldier,5,27 April 2008,"From director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day), this is the first film I have seen starring the French action star, and not a bad one. The film starts in the Vietnam war, where U.S. soldiers Luc Devreux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) are fighting, and kill each other. In the present day their bodies have been flash-frozen and turned into super soldiers, almost human robots, known as ""UniSols"". While carrying out a mission though, both Luc and Andrew are reminded (have flashbacks) of their past lives, and soon enough are ignoring the orders of their new ""commanders"". After Luc gets away, he teams with TV reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) as they are being chased across the country, and Andrew obviously is trying everything to kill him. The ending looks pretty normal when Luc is taken home to his parents, and you don't completely expect to see Andrew again. Also starring Ed O'Ross as Colonel Perry, Jerry Orbach as Dr. Christopher Gregor, Leon Rippy as Woodward, Tico Wells as Garth, Ralf Moeller as GR76, Robert Trebor as Motel Owner, Gene Davis as Lieutenant and Drew Snyder as Charles. The action is not too bad, the dialogue is most certainly the cheese you'd expect to see in comic book speech bubbles, but worth at least one try. Apparently the two straight to video sequels without Van Damme are rubbish, but the fourth when he does come back is even worse, don't think I will be bothering with them (I'd recommend others do the same). Worth watching!",Universal Soldier
4,Woodyanders,Hugely enjoyable sci-fi/action romp,8,16 March 2017,"Noble private Luc Deveraux (an acceptable performance by Jean-Claude Van Damme) and demented sergeant Andrew Scott (robustly played with lip-smacking unhinged gusto by Dolph Lundgren) are a pair of soldiers who kill each other in the Vietnam war. Deveraux and Scott are subsequently transformed into genetically enhanced killing machines who are rigidly programmed to follow orders. However, complications ensue when both Deveraux and Scott regain their memories and pick up where they left off back in Vietnam.Director Roland Emmerich keeps the entertaining story hurtling along at a brisk pace, stages the exciting action set pieces with rip-roaring aplomb, and brings a refreshingly straightforward and unpretentious B-movie sensibility to the whole dynamic show. Better still, neither Emmerich nor the screenwriters Dean Devlin, Christopher Leitch, and Richard Rothstein take the pretty silly premise seriously; instead they treat the blithely trashy material with a pleasing sense of dark self-mocking humor and give Scott several choice one-liners to happily quip. Ally Walker injects her role as spunky and helpful reporter Veronica Roberts with a winning surplus of charm and energy. Moreover, there are solid supporting contributions from Ed O'Ross as the hard-nosed Colonel Perry, Jerry Orbach as the regretful Dr. Christopher Gregor, Leon Rippy as nerdy scientist Woodward, and Tico Wells as Woodward's sassy assistant Garth. Brawny hulks Ralf Moeller and Tommy 'Tiny' Lister portray two of the titular super soldiers. Christopher Franke's spirited score hits the stirring spot. Karl Walter Lindenlaub's slick widescreen cinematography provides an impressive polished look. A real blast.",Universal Soldier
5,ma-cortes,Original and entertaining first Universal Soldier followed by several and inferior sequels,6,20 November 2014,"Acceptable action movie with two wooden but exceptional action men : Van Damme as Luc Deveraux and Lundgren as Andrew Scott as two soldiers who were killed in Vietnam, but the army has a secret project for reanimating dead people as near-perfect soldiers. It deals with a secret organization with top-secret technology, they have created a next-generation Universal Soldier - an elite fighter genetically altered into a programmable killing machine . With the ""UniSol"" under command by the military staff , Colonel Perry (Ed O'Ross), leading the way, they avoid terrorist attacks and robbing . But there a killer soldier , Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) , is executing a criminal spree , the only one who can stop him -as he is threatening to unleash a massacre- is Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a good and amiable soldier UniSol . Along the way Luc is supported by a likable reporter (Ally Walker) . Luc Deveraux's codename in the UNISOL program is GR44 and he will take on not one but various of these virtually indestructible warriors . Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), Deveraux's vicious UniSol enemy and Deveraux to confront a titanic duel among colossus . Now, these elite fighters are locked, loaded and programmed to kill; and the fate of millions hinges on this high-action showdown .This moving picture contains noisy action , thrills , shootouts and fierce combats . From start to finish the action is unstoppable and frenetic . Thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement as well as violence and lots of fights . Breathtaking action movie full of struggles , crossfire and tension , this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . Interesting plot based on a story from Richard Rothstein & Christopher Leitch and screenplay by Dean Devlin , also producer . They designed the special military costumes worn by the old and new model Unisols in US : TNG . And the UniSol's basic sidearm seen in throughout the film is a Magnum Research Inc 357 Magnum Desert Eagle .Though they're all supposed to be American the Universal Soldiers are played by a Belgian (Van Damme) a Swede (Lundgren) and a German (Ralf Moeller). The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as spectacular final . Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren have some scenes together at some impressive fighting . The motion picture was well realized by Roland Emmerich , though Andrew Davis was attached to direct the picture based on a different screenplay. The budget being too high and creative differences arising, Carolco hired Roland Emmerich, fresh from his low budget feature Moon 44 . Roland made his feature length film in 1984 : ¨The Noah's ark principle¨ , he subsequently made ¨Joey¨ . In 1997 wrote, directed, and produced the critically acclaimed ""Moon 44"" . Filmmaker Roland Emmerich quickly understood the freedom and malleability that direct in USA presents and has gone about creating some incredibly interesting genre fare in ¨Universal Soldier¨, his first American movie in which displayed an acute understanding of the action genre . Roland ulteriorly directed 1994 Stargate , 1996 Independence Day , 1998 Godzilla , 2000 The Patriot , 2004 The day after tomorrow , 2008 : 10.000 , 2011 Anonymous and his last movie 2013 White House Down .-Series : The best film of the series was the original ¨Universal soldier¨ by Roland Emmerich with Jean-Claude Van Damme , Dolph Lundgren , Ally Walker , Ed O'Ross ; it was followed by ¨Universal soldier : the return¨ with Jean-Claude Van Damme , Michael Jai White , Heidi Schanz , Xander Berkeley and Justin Lazard as subsequent Universal Soldier films ignore the events of The Return and outright contradict it in a number of ways ; while still an official entry, it is no longer considered part of the series canon . New sequel titled ¨Universal soldier : day of reckoning¨(2012) by John Hyams with Scott Adkins , Andrei 'The Pit Bull' Arlovski , Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme , but here they have not scenes together . And released theatrically in a few countries and Direct-To-Video (DVD & Blu-ray) in the rest of the world .

6,BandSAboutMovies,Near perfection,8,8 July 2019,"Let's give Roland Emmerich a break. For every single horrible movie he created like Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow, I look back at this movie and say, ""I have to forgive him. After all, he made Universal Soldier."" It was written by Richard Rothstein (who created the HBO show The Hitchhiker, Christopher Leitch and Dean Devlin, Roland's usual partner).Back in Vietnam. a U.S. Army team was ordered to take a village, but Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) soon figures out that every person in the village - and many of his own men - have been killed. That's because his sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) has finally gone over the edge. Despite the begging of Deveraux, he kills a young couple. Our hero loses it and both men ends up killing one another. The end? Nope. A second team comes in and freezes them, chalking them up to just two more soldiers missing in action.Years later, both men are part of the UniSol program, a team of elite soldiers who are able to withstand gunfire and run down the side of Hoover Dam. During a mission, Deveraux begins to remember the past and starts to disobey the orders of their commander, Colonel Perry (Ed O'Ross, The Hidden).TV journalist Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker, TV's Profiler) is determined to get the real story. She finds one of the UniSols, GR76 (Ralf Moller, Cyborg) in ice, healing from his wounds. She's discovered and the order is to bring her back, dead or alive. That's when Deveraux finally breaks free of his programming and saves her.Scott also remembers his past self and gives in to his insanity, walking around with a necklace of ears, as he still thinks he's in Vietnam. His big mission now is to find and kill Deveraux. Our hero has gone rogue and he finds Dr. Christopher Gregor (Jerry Orbach) who tells him how the program was started in the 1960s.Hijinks, as they say, ensue, as the one good UniSol left has to battle every single member of his old platoon. There's also an incredible scene that I quote all of the time, where Van Damme beats up an entire bar while muttering, ""I'm tired. I just want to go home. And I just want to eat."" No quote has ever summed up how I feel on any given day of the week more.Look for other soldiers like Michael Jai White (Spawn) and Tiny Lister. Even better, one of the commanding officers is Eugene M. Davis, who played villains in two Bronson movies, 10 to Midnight and Messenger of Death, as well as a cross-dressing snitch in Cruising.Universal Soldier was a much darker movie when it was originally written. Colonel Perry was actually using the incident at the dam to justify the project, with the entire mission being a false flag operation. He then orders Scott to kill anyone in his way as he hunts down Deveraux. Why the change? Probably because after the Gulf War, a negative view of the military probably would have hurt the film's chances to make money.Even weirder, this movie started as another project for Emmerich and Devlin called Isobar. That movie would have starred Sylvester Stallone and Kim Basinger, pitting them against a genetically created monster on a bullet train. After that movie stalled due to a budget growing out of control, they were hired for this movie instead.Also - if you ever see the movie Critical Mass, directed by Fred Olen Ray, it uses the bus chase from this film. It was produced by Andrew Stevens, who started making low budget films based around b-roll footage after he stopped making Cinemax After Dark features.The military was actually watching all of this action and it's why the HK 45 Compact, which has day/night/laser aiming and a suppressor, was added to the arsenal of SEAL Team 6.The thing that really makes me laugh is that for all the ripping off that Sergio Martino's Hands of Steel does of Terminator and Over the Top, this one completely steals that movie's concept! Oh well - I totally love this totally ridiculous action-packed movie all about foreign dudes being US Army zombie soldiers. It's not even a guilty pleasure - I hate that idea - it's a movie I tell everyone about.",Universal Soldier
7,Hey_Sweden,Superb action film.,8,30 June 2012,"Action genre superstars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren headline this slick, high tech thriller that, refreshingly, does have a sense of humour about itself without resorting to a lot of self-conscious jokes. The muscle men play Luc Deveraux and Andrew Scott, two soldiers who were serving in Vietnam when they had an ugly confrontation that resulted in their ""deaths"". Almost a quarter century later, they're reborn as super human fighting machines created as part of a secret government operation (naturally). Problems arise when both of them have their old memories triggered, and remember that they hated each other. So the fight is on! Director Roland Emmerich, who's been pretty consistent since with his handling of mega budget escapism (""Stargate"", ""Independence Day"", ""2012"", etc.), makes this a good deal of fun. Hell, it's got a dream cast for an action fan, even if some of the actors present don't get to do too much. Among Van Damme and Lundgrens' fellow Universal Soldiers (or UniSols, if you will) are Ralf Moeller (""Gladiator""), Tommy 'Tiny' Lister (""No Holds Barred""), Simon Rhee (""Best of the Best""), and Eric Norris (Chucks' son). Ally Walker is both beautiful and perfect for the genre with her energetic portrayal of the feisty female tagalong who attempts to help Luc; also among the strong supporting cast are Ed O'Ross (Arnolds' nemesis in ""Red Heat""), Leon Rippy ('Deadwood', 'Saving Grace'), and Tico Wells (""Trespass""). Van Damme is likable as always, and Lundgren gets a chance to really chew the scenery, especially in his one big emoting scene where he admonishes the stunned onlookers in a supermarket. This scene, unlike any other, shows that nobody is pretending to take any of this very seriously. The script not surprisingly calls for Van Damme to remove his clothes, so there is some eye candy for some viewers. Production design (by Holger Gross) and cinematography (by Karl Walter Lindenlaub) are excellent, the enormous van in which the UniSols travel is pretty bad ass, and the action is first rate, especially the climactic chase scene and the final fight which is atmospherically done. This has become quite the franchise, with several sequels having been released over the years, and it remains a solid entertainment 20 years later. Eight out of 10.",Universal Soldier
8,poolandrews,Very enjoyable futuristic sci-fi thriller action flick.,7,24 April 2008,"Universal Soldier starts in Vietnam where Private Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) & his superior Sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) get into an argument about killing innocent Vietnamese natives & end up killing each other instead. Jump forward twenty odd years & both Deveraux, Scott & several other dead US soldiers have been re-animated as living soldiers with superhuman powers & the ability to regenerate. Nosey network reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) discovers what the military is up to & threatens to break the story to the public, Colonel Perry (Ed O'Ross) can't risk that so sends Universal Soldiers Deveraux & Scott to kill her, remembering back to Vietnam Deveraux again stops Scott from killing an innocent person & in the process annoys Perry who orders both Deveraux & Roberts hunted down & killed...Directed by Roland Emmerich this obvious sci-fi action cash-in on the then recent success & popularity of both Robocop (1987) & Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) is actually a very enjoyable way to pass 100 odd minutes. The script by Richard Rothstein, Christopher Leitch & Dean Devlin takes prominent themes from both Robocop & Terminator 2 like the idea cybernetic type protagonists, plenty of full-on action scenes, lots of violence & profanity, a seemingly emotionless robot/soldier/cop used for corporate/military purposes that starts to regain some of their humanity as well as an attempt at a bit of social commentary & satire although these little stabs don't really hit the mark here & are a mild distraction at best. The whole film is set-up for a string of ever more ambitious set-piece action scenes & from that viewpoint Universal Soldier is all it sets out to be, an enjoyable fast paced sci-fi actioner that doesn't require too many brain cells to understand. The character's are a bit clichéd though like the reporter looking for a big story who stumbles upon more than she bargained for, the single minded military Colonel who puts the mission before anything else & a main bad guy who in this case turns out to be Sergeant Scott to chase the hero for rather tenuous reasons. It's all here, it all works very well, it's a lot of fun & there's plenty of dramatic incident if nothing else.Universal Soldier was Emmerich's break through film & has gone on to make such big budget fare like Stargate (1994), Independence Day (1996), the excellent (I don't care what anyone says) Godzilla (1998), The Day After Tomorrow (2004) & 10,000 B.C. (2008), his subsequent efforts have been considerably less bloody & violent than Universal Soldier though. He does a good job here, get the DVD version & watch it in full 2:35:1 widescreen & enjoy a stylish & well made film. There are several violent martial arts scenes, some good old bar room brawl style fights, several severed ears, there are plenty of gory gunshot wounds including a fair few head shots & a gory impaling. The action scenes are well put together from the bus chase to various shoot-outs to an exploding garage. According to the IMDb the working title for Universal Soldier was Crystal Knights, I am not sure how truthful that is because the title Crystal Knights means absolutely nothing when placed alongside the finished film which is maybe why they changed it but why call it Crystal Knights in the first place?With a supposed budget of about $23,000,000 this is very well made with good production values, special effects, photography & stunts. Shot in Arizona. The acting is OK, I've always liked JCVD & think he's fine in this & he gets to show of his naked bum again, Lundgren has never been a great actor but he does OK in a standard mad as a hatter bad guy role & the two can fight so all in all they make a good pairing. Ed O'Ross & Jerry Orbach from Law & Order (1991 - 2004) provide the acting talent. Looking through the credits it seems that Eric Norris has a small role & he is in fact the youngest son of 80's action star Chuck Norris! Why didn't the filmmakers just hire Chuck? I mean JCVD, Dolph Lundgren & Chuck Norris all in the same film? I am shaking just thinking about it...Universal Soldier is a great sci-fi action film that delivers both plenty of sci-fi & action just as it should, it's not the most deep or meaningful film ever but it sure entertains for 100 odd minutes & to be frank what more do you want? Followed by the made-for-telly Canadian productions Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms (1998) & Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business (1998) & then a theatrically released sequel Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) for which JCVD returned as Luc Deveraux.",Universal Soldier
9,lastliberal,Jean-Claude Van Damme Film Festival,5,26 March 2007,"As we move forward with Jean-Claude Van Damme, we get a little more plot each time. No street fighting in this film; we instead rely on high-tech military hardware. Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are two soldiers who died in Vietnam. They are preserved for 25 years until our Law and Order buddy Jerry Orbach can reconstitute them into Universal Soldiers. As happens in all science fiction, they did not perfect the science and some memories remain and thus the two who fought each other in 'nam are now fighting each other in the US. Lots of bang up chase action and high-tech noise with a predictable ending. Ally Walker showed some good stuff,",Universal Soldier
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,You had to know this was coming,6,4 September 2009,"Seriously. Van Damme and Lundgren? Of course they were going to beat up each other on the big screen, sooner or later. As far as getting to watch the two battle one another, this delivers pretty well, and it's often rather awesome. One might not off-hand think of Emmerich as being behind a film like this... granted, I haven't watched much of anything he did before this, and since, he's pretty much just done different takes on ""something threatens to destroy the world"", with choices so varied one might think he pulls them out of a hat. He does a good job, and this is an entertaining, about average action-flick, with one-liners, shoot-outs, fights, chase sequences, and such. The humor genuinely gets laughs. They made this fairly dark in tone, and the bloody violence is brutal and plentiful. The concept behind this is quite interesting, and this being fairly mainstream, it of course doesn't reach its full potential here. With that said, they could have done a whole lot worse. The guns are cool, marvelous choices and well-handled. Pacing is great, this never really slows down, nor overwhelm you. The acting varies. This is intense and exciting. There is nice tension, as well as dramatic moments. It tries for a point, sort of. The effects hold up, and still look largely convincing. It doesn't feel like this was built around the FX, either. The music is nifty, the score well-composed. There is strong language in this, as well as half-naked men. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD holds a cast & crew commentary track which is informative and funny, an interesting alternate ending that changes things(whether it's superior to the actual one, I leave up to the individual), two featurettes I will review on their own pages here on the site, a teaser, two trailers and a bunch of TV spots. I recommend this to any fan of either or both of the bad-asses, and/or of this type of movie in general. 6/10",Universal Soldier
11,view_and_review,Universal Waste,3,10 April 2020,"What can I say about ""Universal Soldier"" that is worth saying? How about, ""Don't waste your time.""Action stars (not to be confused with actors), Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme team up to make the foreigners-playing-Americans action flick ""Universal Soldier."" The two play soldiers who were platoon-mates who killed each other during the Vietnam War. Instead of being shipped home to be buried, they were shipped home to be used in a government experiment.Through some scientific process whereby their bodies were ""hyper-accelerated"" they were re-animated. In other words they were brought back from the dead. Among other abilities they now had was super-strength and regenerative abilities after a wound or injury. The only drawback is that this hyper-acceleration heated their bodies so much they had to be put on ice.25 years after their deaths they both had a ""regressive traumatic recall"" which caused them to abandon their orders and go rogue. The ""regressive traumatic recall"" was them remembering or reliving the last events that took place before they died. Well, before they died Sgt. Andrew Scott (Lundgren) was a psychotic soldier who was killing civilians and Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) was the soldier that tried to stop him. Once they had a total recall, they resumed their feud.There was nothing special about this movie. Truly, it was just another means of showcasing JCVD's muscles, punches, and kicks. The story was very weak and offered nothing unique. Even the witty one-liners were DOA. Avoid this unless you want to see another movie in which JCVD is nude.",Universal Soldier
12,FlashCallahan,'I'm all ears.....',8,10 January 2010,"Great action sci-fi from the guy who likes to blow up the USA in most of his recent movies.The story is basically about soldiers who were killed in Nam, and are regenerated by the government/some private company, into super-soldiers, who dress really cool and can do really cool stuff whilst having one eye covered.Two of these are Van Damme and Lundgren. About twenty minutes into the film, Lundgren wakes up and realises that Van Damme has a better career, and starts to go on a rampage, and takes over as the leader of the Uni-Sols.there is nothing to be taken seriously in this movie. It's basically an excuse for the two stars to have fights and chases on numerous occasions. Lundgren is fantastic as the evil Scott and should do more villains. Van Damme keeps it low key in this film, and doesn't say very little apart from lines like 'What accent' and cocking his head like a puppy.it's very funny in places, especially where Van Damme and Phallic metaphors are concerned, but it's slickly made and there are some great set pieces.the story is okay, but nothing special, and the final fifteen minutes is just pure mayhem.",Universal Soldier
13,Aaron1375,Van Damme and Dolph play United States super soldiers...ironically neither speaks very good English.,6,3 February 2010,"This was not a bad movie really, it had some moments and did entertain a bit. It also could have been better too, a lot better. For a movie about super soldiers it just was not all that action packed as you would expect and the end of the movie was all about Van Damme's kick boxing skills rather than about them being super soldiers. The film is about a new breed of soldier, a soldier literally reanimated from the dead with only the mission as their primary concern. Unfortunately, they may have been better off trying to get volunteers as one of the soldiers has memories of the lead guy going crazy and that guy ends up going crazy yet again. He basically takes control of the super soldiers and begins to hunt down the other guy. Like I said it needed a bit more. Maybe a couple of other actors in the leads would have helped as neither Damme or Dolph are the best actors in the world. Damme has that thick accent and Dolph kind of slurs his words so he is hard to understand at times unless he is speaking Russian as he was in ""Rocky IV"". There are some good points to the film though and in one restaurant scene there is a rather humorous moment as Van Damme proceeds to eat a lot of food, however he does not quite get you are supposed to pay. Still, all this action and all this super soldier talk and the movie ends quite similar to the end of ""Cyborg"" with a face off in the rain which is mainly used to showcase Van Damme's kick boxing skills. At least this time though he is not facing off against a blind man so it works a bit better. So in the end it is a somewhat enjoyable movie to watch, but it could have used some improvement.",Universal Soldier
14,mm-39,"This film is short, but good.",7,10 February 2002,"This film is short, but good.  It has filler in the middle, the sci-fi, and action mixes well.

18,bowmanblue,Van-Damme's 'Terminator 2',8,15 June 2015,"'Shared universes' are kind of in vogue these days, largely thanks to Marvel's superheroes movies. However, if one film was supposedly happening in the same world as another back in the early nineties, I'd wager that 'Universal Soldier' would be happening while the Terminator and John Connor busted Sarah out of that mental institution.Yes, both films are made by the same production company and some of the same producers are behind the two of them, however Universal Solider will never quite be remembered as fondly as Arnie's second cyborg outing. T2 had bigger stars, better effects and a deeper plot, but there's no denying that the two films share the same 'vibe.' Van-Damme plays a Vietnam soldier, killed in action during the war, and then resurrected by a black-ops military agency as a 'super soldier,' used for thwarting terrorists. Yes, feel free to ignore what happened to Van-Damme's corpse during the twenty-five or so years between death and revival. This would be all well and good if it wasn't for the fact that the same unit also revived Van-Damme's borderline psychotic commanding officer, played (amazingly!) by Dolph Lundgren. Now, these two bad boys had a history of animosity between the pair of them when they were alive, so old grievances are soon revived along with the soldiers' bodies and the two go head to head.And it's great fun – violent, action-packed, big, dumb, stupid fun. And it knows it. Like T2, there's actually some nice moments of humour which are never overused and do help to lighten the mood and give it a 'comic-book feel.' Both lead actors have been criticised over the years of being little more than muscle men with no real acting ability. However, in my opinion, both shine here. Van-Damme is the good guy, but never boring due to his naïve personality. He can't really remember what he was and what he's here for and has a childlike quality in the new world he's found himself in. Lundgren is just psychotic. In know this is just a loud, over-the-top sci-fi film, but, in terms of lunatic badguys, he's right up there with them.Maybe Universal Solider is mainly for guys, especially those who (now) enjoy The Expendables-type movies which bask in the glories of the silly old action films of yesteryear. It's not T2, but it's a nice little comedian piece to it.",Universal Soldier
19,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,6 June 2014,"Universal SoldierThe only way to defeat an army of robots is to download a PTSD virus onto their system.Thankfully, the armed forces in this sci-fi film are only reanimated corpses.After shooting each other in Vietnam, Private Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and Sergeant Scott (Dolph Lundgren) are resuscitated in the 1990s under a secret military operation.Tasked with wiping out terrorists, the pair does its job flawlessly.But when Scott's bloodlust returns, it jogs Deveraux's memories of what happened in 'Nam and of the family he left behind.With Scott unhinged, Deveraux is compelled to help a reporter (Ally Walker) expose the army's inhuman experimentation, even if it means taking down his teammates.Perfectly cast as emotionless robots, the mumble-mouth leads make the most of the formulaic material by relying more on stern looks and leg splits to convey their feelings. Furthermore, recycling dead soldiers saves a fortune on death notifications.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Universal Soldier
20,The-Sarkologist,One of the better Van Damme Movies,4,27 December 2013,"Well, Dolph Lundgrun and Jean Claude Van Damme in the same movie? If so then why would anybody want to watch it? Okay, there are a few die-hard Van Damme fanatics out there but even so, what makes Van Damme that appealing? Personally I don't really know. In my opinion, I can't stand the guy's acting ability. I personally do not know him but from what I have seen of his movies, they aren't all that great. People ooohhh and ahhh about his martial arts moves, but the guy's a dancer, and Patrick Swazye is far better. I guess this is a mystery that will never be solved.Universal Soldier is actually one of Van Damme's better movies, though none can really beat Hard Target with the skillful direction of John Woo. This movie though his acting ability seems to be much better, but that is probably because he keeps his mouth shut most of the time. As such this movie is vaguely tolerable.This movie is about two soldiers who kill each other in Vietnam after one of them brutally kills some innocent Vietnamese. They are declared missing in action and the bodies are taken back to the United States to take part in an experiment where the dead tissue is resurrected. The dead soldiers are thus transformed into living soldiers, and are sent to perform very dangerous missions. These soldiers have a flaw, the last emotion they experienced now dominates them, so many drugs are used to suppress these emotions and memories.The themes of this movie tackles the ethics of experiments and the fallibility of humanity. Firstly the military experiments are very unethical. Generally our society has respect for the dead and to reanimate the bodies is considered to be evil. If we look through our literature, the animating of corpses is generally considered to be the realm of evil sorcerers. Thus the scientists working on this project are constantly thinking about the ethics of the project while the commander in charge simply wants to be recognised. As such, in here and other cases, ethics is swallowed up by the desire of one man to become famous.The flaw in these soldiers though shows us how by creating something more powerful than us, there is the possibility of it turning on us. This is another theme that has been around for a long time and is explored deeply within Frankenstein. In fact Van Damme's character resembles Frankenstein's monster in that he is treated as being evil when all he wants to do is to return home. The evil awakens within Lundgrun's character though, because he is a fanatical right winged military man who will kill anybody not the same as he is.This seems to crouch into being an anti-right winged film because the most right character, that being Lundgrun, is bad. Where as killing innocent Vietnamese was common in the war, especially when they did not know who was a Viet Cong, this movie escalates it. Thus when Lundgrun breaks loose of his bonds, he lives out his paranoia in that there is a secret anti-American government out to destroy him. This is made out as being paranoid delusion, while the secret activities of the army, a leftist idea, is made out as true.Universal Soldier is a tolerable movie. I do not warm to it much though, yet I did not feel that I wasted my time watching it. Unlike other Van-Damme movies, it does seem to hold the interest, if only for a little while.",Universal Soldier
21,paulclaassen,Cheesy Terminator wannabe requires no brain cells.,4,1 October 2018,"The film is pretty much a 'Terminator' wannabe, as the plot is similar - just simplified. This film doesn't require much from the audience in the form of brain cells, as it is a plain and simple premise where they love destroying things. The action scenes are very well done, especially the bus chase scene towards the end, which also has some great aerial photography. The rest are pretty much shoot or blow em up scenes, which ain't a bad thing. Its entertaining. Unfortunately I found the film very cheesy at times - in both dialogue and actions from the cast. And why must the extras always be such dicks? The restaurant scene in particular was just stupid. Then there's the cliched moronic motel owner. There was just too much stupidity to fully enjoy this film. In fact, the film became almost unwatchable at one point no thanks to all this stupidity. The huge truck used in the film was impressive, though. Ultimately the film did have a satisfying ending.",Universal Soldier

23,tarbosh22000,"If you haven't yet seen it (or haven't watched it in a long while), see Universal Soldier!",8,26 October 2011,"Back in 'Nam, soldier Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) met and became mortal enemies with the sinister fellow soldier Andrew Scott (Lundgren). Luc objected to Scott's killing of civilians, and in the ensuing brouhaha, they end up killing each other. Or so we think. In 1992, they, along with other former soldiers have been turned by the government into ""Universal Soldiers"", or ""Unisols"" for short. They are part man, but part machine as well, and have been programmed to follow orders emotionlessly. But slowly both Luc and Andrew start to regain more and more of their humanity. Luc escapes the compound with reporter Veronica Roberts (Walker) - but Andrew is not happy about that. So now Luc and Veronica are on the run, with Andrew chasing them everywhere they go and causing a lot of mayhem along the way. Old grudges die hard as the final fight proves. What will happen? Universal Soldier is a classic from the golden age of action in America. This was a time from the late 80's to early 90's when movies like this went to the theater and had decent budgets behind them. And this in particular was such a success that is spawned four (soon to be five as of this writing) sequels. But the high quality of this production goes a long way and is nice to see, especially in light of the brutal violence and constant, messy head shots which are usually reserved for lower-budget outings.But, beyond the violence, there are some interesting messages at work. One is that humanity will always remain in us and is stronger than any outside force. Despite all that has happened to them, Luc is still good and Andrew is still evil. The movie also tries to make modern-day parallels to their 'Nam experiences. Funnily enough, there's a (probably inadvertent) pro-steroid message, as characters get stronger and win fights after they inject a chemical into themselves. Besides Van Damme and Lundgren together at last, we shouldn't forget Ralf Moeller is on hand as well. That's right, Brakus himself plays a Unisol. Now that's an amazing power-trio if there ever was one. As if that wasn't impressive enough, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister and Simon Rhee also play Unisols. Of course, the whole program was developed by Lennie - i.e. Jerry Orbach - who really doesn't get a lot of screen time. Ally Walker as the classic know-nothing reporter who serves as some kind of audience identification is okay, not great. But Dolph puts in a rare animated performance and seems to relish being the super-evil baddie here.While the movie follows a very definite formula, there's also plenty of humor so the proceedings don't get too dour. Part of that, presumably, is the surprising amount of un-asked-for, unneeded Van Damme nudity. But the Unisols are kept in cold storage like so many hot dogs, and their eyepiece resembles an evil monocle, adding to their scary appearance. It's also amusing to see Belgians and Swedes fighting in the Vietnam War...but come to think of it, this movie can really be summed up in three words: Necklace Of Ears.Just get some action stars and a solid budget and entertainment will ensue. If only Hollywood kept on this path, but sadly they didn't. If you haven't yet seen it (or haven't seen it in a long while), see Universal Soldier.For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",Universal Soldier

26,helpless_dancer,dead soldiers go at each other,7,2 April 1999,"I usually avoid Van Damme's movies. He is a turkey actor who makes really bad choppy socky films. But this one was pretty good, not great, but watchable. The government brings back to life a group of dead Viet Nam soldiers and turns them into bionic warriors. The plot thickens when 2 of the soldiers don't get along because of problems they had when alive. Good action and fight scenes keep the film moving right along at a good, if predictable, clip. Worth seeing.",Universal Soldier
27,Anonymous_Maxine,Super Soldiers of the future  set in far off 1993!!,7,3 May 2008,"Universal Soldier starts out in 1968 with Van Damme playing the good guy, standing up for some innocent Vietnamese people in a village during the war. Dolph Lundgren plays an embittered American soldier, consumed with anger about his fellow soldiers who have been killed in the war, and intent on taking it out on any Vietnamese people he can find. Luc (Van Damme) insists that the village has been cleared and those people have done nothing wrong, and the ensuing conflict leads to both of them killing each other before the opening credits are even over. The dead soldiers are declared M.I.A., not because their having killed each other would be a little difficult to explain, but because they are needed for a new kind of military technology.Now here's where I get a little lost. We cut to the ""Present Day Nevada Desert,"" 25 years later. You'll notice that 25 years after 1968 you'll find 1993, the year after this movie was released. I supposed the original audiences were left in complete terror about what was going to take place around the following Spring. The rest of us may wonder why the movie markets itself as being a story about futuristic military technology, when it takes place about 5-6 months after the release date.At any rate, we are immediately taken to a tense hostage situation that is taking place, if I'm not mistaken, on the Hoover Dam, so that the new cyborg-soldiers could be put to the test (a full quarter of a century after they were made). Truly they are impressive pieces of machinery (or whatever they are), and the situation is soon under control. The local news outlets gleefully report that the situation has been taken care of, and with ""no casualties or injuries."" Maybe they forgot about the dozen or so innocent people that had been machine gunned right there in the middle of the road in broad daylight. Or maybe they just don't count.The movie plays around a lot with what Luc and Andrew Scott (Lundgren) have become. There's a scene where, after Luc begins having flashbacks of Vietnam and escapes with an attractive reporter (who was fired for being late to the scene), he walks outside naked as the day he was born, explaining that he's hot. You see, one of the symptoms of the new soldiers is that their body temperature runs hot, so they have to sleep in refrigerated compartments to avoid overheating. Soon after that, they are discovered, so Luc (now named GR-44) asks Veronica, the reporter, to examine his naked, chiseled body and look for where they have hidden the tracking device. ""Look for something unusual,"" he tells her. ""Something hard."" Clearly, the ideas lifted by the boatload from the Terminator movies need not be named. I have only room for 1,000 words here, and to list the borrowed ideas would take more than that. But even though there are literally scenes lifted directly from the Terminators (like the café scene where GR-44 casually beats the crap out of everyone in sight), the movie never feels like a rip-off. Maybe that's because, for all the bad rap he gets, Van Damme has a definite, undeniable on screen charm. At one point, not long after they've met, Veronica asks him where he's from. ""I figured you gotta be French or something,"" she says, ""because of your accent."" ""What accent?"" he asks. He seems genuinely confused. The movie sort of descends into routine action clichés by the time GR's 13 (Lundgren) and 44 start having flashbacks, and start to remember that they killed each other and hence have unfinished business. It seems that they revert to the emotion that they had at the time they died, so GR-13 wants vengeance of anyone within shooting distance, while GR-44 just wants to go home. Thus we get the government-made super-soldiers trying to kill each other. This leads to a half amusing and half disturbing scene where GR-13 terrorizes some astonished civilians in a supermarket (while another GR mindlessly gnaws on a raw steak), and then ultimately to the obligatory final showdown.I found the ""explanation"" for the transformation particularly interesting. I feel like, in science fiction movies, how the 'fiction' is explained is where most of the creativity lies. Sadly, there's not much here. A scientist explains to Veronica how it all worked. ""By hyper-accelerating the bodies, we discovered that we could turn dead flesh into living tissue."" Hyper-accelerating? Is that how they got the soldiers to age super-slow? Or not at all, and for 25 years? Sadly, we may never know. When Veronica replies, ""What are you saying, doctor?"" there is a knock at the door, so he doesn't really have time to explain. Too bad.There's not much to be said about the ending. It's the worst part of the movie, by far. An enormous copout the likes of which is rarely seen even in bad b-movies. But I should also mention that the movie is not as bad as the ending, or even as bad as many people say. It's not a science fiction classic, but it's a fun action popcorn movie, like many of Van Damme's films. If nothing else, the movie teaches us a valuable lesson - don't throw a beer can at a man wearing a necklace made out of human ears.Note: At the Cannes Film Festival when Universal Soldier was released, Van Damme and Lundgren got into an argument and then a shoving match right there on the red carpet in front of the world's cameras (you can check it out on YouTube). Many lament that we may never know if it was real or just a publicity stunt. It definitely looked real to me, but if it wasn't, then all the mystery around it must mean that they really CAN act!",Universal Soldier
28,jtindahouse,"Flat, Plain Action!!!",6,25 April 2005,Nothing special whatsoever. I did not like this movie because there was nothing to it. A decent movie has to have a twist and en excellent movie will have multiple twists but this had none. It relied purely on the fact that Jean-Claude Van Damme was in it and that didn't carry it. It made a few bad attempts at humor but even put those in at the wrong times. There was nothing terribly original about the fight scenes either which I was surprised at because Jean-Claude Van Damme generally does have pretty good fight scenes but they just didn't seem to be there in this film.The only reason I can give anyone to watch this movie is if you're an absolutely die hard Jean-Claude fan. Otherwise do not bother.,Universal Soldier
29,freemantle_uk,A Classic 90s Actioneer,8,20 April 2019,"Universal Soldier was Roland Emmerich's first American film and made at time where macho action films were king. And it deserves a place in the large back catalogue of '90s action films. Watching it as a first time viewer in 2019 it was refreshing because it was a simple high-concept film that had well crafted practical effects, stunt work and unashamedly violent. It may not be the best acted film considering its leads nor particularly deep film but it makes up for by being a simple, well-crafted film and is a breezy watch.",Universal Soldier
30,dee.reid,One of the most awesomely bad-a** action films from the early 1990s!,8,11 January 2013,"On a scale of ""1"" to ""10"" on the meter for one of the most awesomely bad-a** action movies from the early 1990s, 1992's ""Universal Soldier"" rates about an ""8."" I mean that, really.For one, it has BOTH Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren going head-to-head, their murderous hatred of one another spanning the course of three decades. Of course, the sci-fi/action plot shamelessly re-hashes elements of ""The Terminator"" (1984), ""RoboCop"" (1987) and maybe even a little bit of ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), but it's impossible to not like the finished product - just a little bit, even if it's just to see Van Damme and Lundgren sharing the same scenery together and exchanging death-blows.Another little tid-bit is that ""Universal Soldier"" marked the early beginnings of the future ""master of disaster"" himself, German-born Roland Emmerich, who would go on to make such science fiction fanfare as his next film after this one, 1994's ""Stargate,"" and followed it up with blockbuster disaster epics ""Independence Day"" (1996) (my personal favorite of his so far), ""Godzilla"" (1998), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004), and ""2012"" (2009). But he had to start somewhere, and ""Universal Soldier"" was his introduction to the United States, and it's not a bad effort, nor is it really anything like he subsequently directed in the U.S.Beginning in Vietnam in 1969, good-natured, morally principled Private Luc Devereax (Van Damme), who is at the end of his tour of duty, stumbles upon a massacre where innocent Vietnamese civilians and fellow American soldiers have been slaughtered alike - all their ears severed. Deveraux finds the culprit, Sergeant Andrew Scott (Lundgren), who has gone insane and considers anyone who opposes him as a traitor to his rage- and violence-fueled war against the insurgents. In short order, the two kill each other, only to find themselves re-animated in the present as Universal Soldiers (or ""UniSols""), mindless, emotion-less genetically enhanced killing machines that operate with perfect logic under remote-control as part of a top-secret government program involving the (illegal) regeneration of dead American soldiers.And of course the UniSols operate with perfect logic - they have to - except for the little traces of human memory and emotion still lurking around somewhere deep within their subconscious. And soon, GR44/Deveraux and GR13/Scott come to relive the exact same Vietnam-era horrors and hatreds that originally turned them against each other - in the present. As Deveraux gradually recovers his memory and learns his past, with the help of nosy reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker), he embarks on a cross-country quest for his original identity - with the increasingly insane Scott hot on their trail.""Universal Soldier"" contains many of the same car chases, gun-fights, explosions, and kick-boxing mayhem audiences will come to expect from this type of film - with a heavy dose of graphic blood and violence added in for good measure. But Roland Emmerich directs the picture with such ferocious macho attitude, and energy, that it still leaves a lasting impact 21 years later. It's an action movie that rightfully earns its title as a bad-a** action flick. Van Damme makes good in a part that requires a minimalist acting performance, yet it still shows shades that he is indeed capable of a dramatic performance (see 2008's ""JCVD"" for further details). But it's Lundgren who steals the show in another villainous turn from his impressive role as Ivan Drago, American boxer Rocky Balboa's Soviet nemesis, from ""Rocky IV"" (1985).And the two have one of the most awesomely bad-a** martial arts showdowns in recent memory at Deveraux's family farm in Louisiana at the end of the film.The future just isn't big enough for the both of them.8/10",Universal Soldier
31,Fluke_Skywalker,Brain dead,5,13 December 2014,"This was really the first time that JCVD graduated beyond low budget karate movies and into the realm of popcorn entertainment. Unlike fellow early 90s karate man Steve Segal, who would more or less make the same film over and over for his entire career, Van Damme flirted for a while with becoming the next Arnold, and perhaps no film in JCVD's filmography is more Schawzeneggerian than 'Universal Soldier'.Directed by the man who would go on to become the king of the disaster movie, Roland Emmerich, it's heavy on gory violence, but paradoxically light on action. The result is a surprisingly dull film carried mostly by a strong turn from villain Dolph Lundgren, who steals the movie right out from under JCVD.",Universal Soldier
32,jimbo-53-186511,"The plotting is ludicrous and even within its own world it lacks any kind of logic, but as a basic actioner it is reasonably effective (despite its numerous flaws)",5,19 July 2017,"Private Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude-Van Damme) and Sergeant Scott (Dolph Lundgren) are killed during the war in Vietnam. Several years later, they are brought back to life as obedient cyborgs by a covert and off- the-book government programme. However, when both of the former soldiers start to reform their old memories, all hell starts to break loose...In some ways, science fiction films are often the most difficult to review as they are often created in an alternate reality where the writers can make things up (meaning that what may seem like big plot holes in the real world may not be plot holes in the writer's world). However, I do feel that even science-fiction films should have some kind of internal logic and this is where Universal Soldier runs into problems...OK; so a covert team have somehow managed to turn dead flesh into living tissue which enables them to create a team of obedient cyborg soldiers - I presume that lobotomies were carried out on the soldiers to suppress their memories, but this is purely supposition as this is never clarified. Devereaux's memory cap is popped by getting a sense of Deja Vu, or a flashback to his days in Nam (which I suppose is plausible at a stretch). However, Scott's 'Total Recall' comes out of nowhere and essentially occurs when he smashes through a car windscreen. Perhaps a head trauma triggered it, but this is never explained in the film and seems rather ridiculous when scrutinised.The wider story (involving the recruitment of reimagined cyborgs stepping in to assist in crime fighting) is a good idea, but it's given so little thought or consideration in this picture that it actually becomes rather laughable. Once Devereaux's memory cap is popped he goes on the run with news reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) and the pair find themselves being chased by Scott and the remaining cyborgs. However, what doesn't make sense to me is that a bunch of cyborgs which are controlled by some kind of covert sub-division government would seemingly intentionally draw so much attention to themselves? Literally thousands of rounds are fired and literally everyone that the cyborgs encounter either gets killed or they end up kissing the pavement, but yet there are never any police, FBI or government officials who seem to get involved or investigate any of these occurrences. Even the way that this covert operation (in respect of the cyborgs) is handled feels rather laughable - they have an eye camera and an ear piece that can easily be dislodged which results in the cyborgs being of no use to them. Couldn't they have created something more sophisticated?Still if you overlook all the holes in the story (and admittedly it is hard to do) and overlook the rather bad acting (again difficult, but not impossible) then as an action film it is perfectly serviceable. Many of the fight sequences between Lundgren and Van-Damme are quite well-staged and Van Damme's fight in the diner is a good tongue-in-cheek action fest as well. It's fair to say that no-one was ever going to be Oscar-nominated in this film, but I have to say that Lundgren (despite how bad he was), did at least try to make this film fun - even with his rather atrocious 'I'm all ears' one-liner.With its ludicrous plotting and lack of any sort of logic Universal Soldier remains a serviceable and very basic action flick, but doesn't have the involving narrative of the many films it borrows from meaning that it is OK as a one time watch, but offers little more than that.",Universal Soldier

I watched all these guys on video from young & Van Damme was always one of the absolute best of bunch, in the top 3 with Schwarzenegger & Stallone for me. Some of my favourite action films ever are Van Damme's such as Hard Target & Double Impact & Cyborg & Death Warrant & A.w.o.l & Street Fighter, the guy is a legend of Cinema & the type we won't get again.Anyway ""Universal Soldier"" was definitely one of Van Damme's & Dolph Lindgren's biggest hits of the Awesome 90's & both give Awesome action-packed performances in this Action sci-fi Cult Classic.Van Damme is Awesome as resurrected Soldier Luc Devereux who still has a good heart in there but is of course a part of the Universal Soldier programme that brings back dead soldiers with technology & basically create the ultimate warrior for the battlefield by the government. These soldiers are like Cyborgs in away but there's still something human in there & Luc fights back against his creators.Dolph Lundgren gives probably his most famous & iconic role (after his Rocky character) as the sadistic killing machine & ex-Commander of Luc's army unit from their dangerous Vietnam days. Lundgren is a big hulking & icey-cold killing machine with a deadly past between himself & Luc & that comes back even as these Universal Soldiers & then all hells breaks loose.Lundgren was a loose cannon even when he was alive & was a psycho soldier who loved killing & cutting off his victims ears!!!! & Luc went against him back in their Vietnam days & it's about to kick off again now.Universal Soldier is an excellent, exciting & action-packed Sci-fi Thriller with two greats of the Action genre & its pure 90's look & feel give it a comforting feel to me as i grew up in those times of the 90's & have big Nostalgia for all these types of films & actors from that time.Also the excellent Ed O'Ross (Red Heat, Another 48hrs) has a good part as a commander of the Universal Soldier programme.

The latest 2004 DVD is the first time in anamorphic Widescreen with the same sound quality. DVD has an ingraining commentary track by the director, co-writer:Delvin and actors:Van Damme & Lundgren. DVD has two amusing featured and an darker alternative ending.Universal Soldier went on to be Van Damme's best film, even Van Damme admits that his favorite film. This is Lundgren's best role to date. The film also stars:Ed O'Ross (Full Metal Jacket), Leon Rippy (The Patroit) and the late-Jerry Orbach (Dirty Dancing). Universal Soldier is followed by two t.v. sequels without Van Damme and Walker. Followed by a real sequel with Van Damme. Don't miss this violent but enjoyable film.

36,gcd70,Something borrowed,5,15 October 2007,"Roland Emmerich has borrowed from several films (including ""The Terminator"" and ""Robocop"") to create this new action vehicle for Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. The two are 'Universal Soldiers', unstoppable combat soldiers used in top secret military special operations. Only there is one problem, they're not completely controllable.This is a routine action flick, so none of the action sequences are particularly inspired. It is for the most part fairly entertaining though, even if it's very light, and the occasional humour, which is indeed quite good, helps proceedings nicely. Not too bad.Monday, September 28, 1992 - Hoyts Cinema Centre",Universal Soldier
37,I_Ailurophile,An action classic that holds up,8,8 July 2021,"Jean-Claude Van Damme! Dolph Lundgren! Any action film starring both these icons, especially one made by blockbuster director Roland Emmerich, has got to be worth its weight in gold, right?Apart from the immediate, severe violence that serves as exposition, the most notable thing about 'Universal Soldier' is the clear direct inspiration from the 'Terminator' films. Enhanced strength, inability to feel pain, lack of emotion, and relative invulnerability define the ""UniSols."" Add into the mix a history of enmity, imperfect memory erasure, and a rogue military program, and the stage is set for an action extravaganza.Make no mistake, we get treated to a lot of gunfights, fistfights, chases, explosions, and bloodletting in general - plus a measure of gore, to taste. All the effects, stunts, set pieces, and props look good; I especially like the design of the truck that figures prominently in the program. It's pretty fun overall, even if the thrills are broadly somewhat customary and lack a distinguishing, significant punch. That said, the action sequences are actually fairly outstanding, especially nearer the end.The nature of the UniSol as defined by the narrative plays an interesting role here. On the one hand, the loss of self means that Van Damme and Lundgren's quite average acting skills are no obstacle, as one can easily chalk up any deficiency or exaggeration to the characterizations as written. That also means that the performances by the swell supporting cast - including Robert Trebor, Jerry Orbach, and Ally Walker - at least match if not exceed the greater prominence of the hero and villain.On the other hand, the universal soldier's lack of emotion, lending itself to a hint of comedy, also means that the excitement that should be conveyed in action scenes is dulled a bit by the same affectation. It's a difficult balance that the writers struggle to achieve. Dialogue and character interactions otherwise consist of plot advancement or cheeky one-liners, so the strength of 'Universal soldier' relies on its action and the realization of its premise - and that realization falters at times.I'm nitpicking, though. What it comes down to is that this is hardly the end-all-be-all of action films, but even almost 30 years after its release - it's solid, reasonably well written, and surprisingly good overall. Within the long list of both Van Damme and Lundgren's credits it's probably fair to say that this is among the most enduring, consistent features. Whether you're a fan of the action heroes specifically or simply the genre in general, 'Universal soldier' remains worth checking out.",Universal Soldier
38,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Interesting story with a dragging plot,6,9 May 2014,"Before films like Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables (2010) were released, most action stars performed solo. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgren, and Jean-Claude Van Damme all made their own separate movies. Combining star power wasn't usually thought of because of how different the fan bases were. However, this movie is one those exceptions. Today it could be considered a movie where they collaborated before they were extremely well known (although at the time they were anyway). It was rare at that time to see two big names on the same screen - which probably pumped up a lot of people.Here, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren play Luc Deveraux and Andrew Scott, two Vietnam veteran soldiers killed in the line of duty, who end up being regenerated to serve as a UniSol (short for Universal Soldier). As a UniSol, their purpose is to carry out impossible tasks that no other ordinary soldier could do. To carry out these missions, the UniSols are monitored and commanded by remote audio instructions. One day on the latest mission, Luc begins to have a relapse of old memories and begins to bug out. After disobeying an order, he runs off with reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) to find out what he missed. Close behind them is Luc's colonel with Andrew Scott 2nd in command looking to rid them of their existence.For the majority of the running time, the plot is a big chase. Yet, in only some instances does it actually feel like a chase. Writer Dean Devlin managed to include some unique scenes but his pacing on how the story moves, plods from time to time. That's not to say the material he includes in the story isn't noteworthy. Again, this goes back to some unique scenes that Devlin included - most of which involve Andrew Scott (Lundgren). This movie is also one of the few that director Roland Emmerich did not include a political commentary on since this idea is so far fetched. However, he does mingle some themes that are still important to recognize - for example, playing the role of God. If there was the technology to actually re-animate dead tissue, would it be possible to have complete control over the body? Hard to say, the mind is a tricky thing.However, the movie cannot be analyzed too much because throughout the story there are a lot of loopholes and questions that aren't answered - like how can someone survive a fall from an enormous height and not come back mangled or even bruised? This is one those films where it's fun to watch but cannot be taken literal because of how absurd the idea really is. The acting can be moderately dealt with. Ally Walker plays her role like any other person would. She has a few lines that'll make people chuckle but not much else. Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting is stone faced for most of the time because of how he's not familiar with the world. However, Dolph Lundgren looked like he had a great time playing his role because of how deranged his character is. It was also wise of the casting department to at least make Lundgren the antagonist because of his height. If it were the other way around, I'm not sure if the entertainment level would be as high.What is fun to watch here, is when Lundgren and Van Damme finally clash. Since they both have martial arts training, there's no question that the kicks and fists will fly between them. Lundgren's got the bulk and Van Damme's got the agility. They both are good in contrast to each other, the only thing that was needed was Van Damme putting just a little more emotion into his role. Other than that, the cinematography and editing works well too. Finally, composing the musical score belongs to Christopher Franke who now produces music for The Amazing Race (2002) series. Franke's score does contain tunes that can be heard with light emotional tones but it's nothing too deep; which is pretty much how the film should be taken. Fun but not deep.The action on screen between Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme is fun even though it is sporadic. The story elements are interesting considering it also makes the plot drag. Look for nothing too deep here.",Universal Soldier
39,alexanderdavies-99382,A good film with enough destruction to satisfy one and all.,7,11 August 2018,"""Universal Soldier"" was the first JCVD movie I came across but it's taken me about 24 years to see it.
 Now that I have, I have to admit that it's a pretty good flick. Jean-Claude Van Damme does his usual and includes some impressive moves. Dolph Lundgren makes the mistake of trying to act and it doesn't come off well.
 The climatic one on one confrontation between the two is worth waiting for. It's a knock down, drag out affair and very entertaining.",Universal Soldier
40,PredragReviews,"""$20 security deposit, huh?""",8,24 July 2016,"Roland Emmerich turns out decent work when he starts with a decent idea. And this movie is based on an extremely cool idea: a secret government project to use the reanimated corpses of dead soldiers as 'UniSols'. They're like killer combat zombies equipped to receive commands remotely, impervious to pain, quick to heal, and pretty much unstoppable although they tend to overheat if they stay active for too long. There isn't a huge amount of action in the film, but in between scenes we get to see a lot of Lundgren's bad guy one-liners and attitude. Van Damme doesn't have many fights either until the end, when he goes up against the Lundgren character.This is a fun, violent movie, with both stars hamming it up, Van Damme the more stoic of the two. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more marital arts in the film. Oh, there are a couple of kicks thrown but no real Karate fighting. Though Van Damme was well known for busting' moves by 1992, Dolph had only recently started illustrating his abilities in that department, particularly with the previous year's ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"", co-starring Brandon Lee. The action is not bad, otherwise, with plenty of stuff blowing' up and dudes being thrown through windows n' stuff. Overall, it has good action, a few cheesy moments but also a few memorable catch phrases (some of which I can't repeat here).Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Universal Soldier
41,MR_Heraclius,Universal Soldier,6,24 February 2020,"The premise and the cast outweigh the storyline and that's the real shame about this film. You have two big names in the action scene of the 90s and an up and coming mega director. The real issue with the film is the lack of a coherent explanation for the storyline. The film has a large action scope and that car chase scene later in the film looks incredible on 4k. There was a better film to made here and it's a shame they didn't exploit the use of the two leads. Van Damme is very quiet and lacks the usual charisma that comes with his films. Let's be honest, the two leads don't have strong acting traits, but they do maintain presence. The film could've been different and grittier, but something was not right in the pre-production and production of this film.",Universal Soldier
42,Angelus2,"It's an action movie with Van Damme, enough said.",7,4 September 2009,"I remember as a child catching the end of this movie or the beginning or even the middle and then having to go to bed. But as a twenty year old man I sat down yesterday and decided to watch this movie that seemed to elude me as a child and I found it quite enjoyable.I've never been the greatest Van Damme fan, I've only watched Kickboxer and the terrible 'Street Fighter'. So, I thought it wouldn't b very good, but it surpasses my low expectations.The American government has found a way to revive their dead soldiers and control them to approach situations that would be suicidal for their own men..But one soldier goes rogue and then the hunt begins.Van Damme's acting isn't Oscar worthy, but that's not why he is famous. It's his fighting abilities, his kicks; the speed and power as well as the infinite grace. And he displays that in this movie as he destroys people who get in his way. Dolph Lundgren a major star back in the 80's gives a satisfactory performance as the soldier who still thinks he is at war and add's some sort of credibility to the role...All in all a good action film.",Universal Soldier
43,IonicBreezeMachine,Suped up action nonsense delivered with entusiasm and tradecraft,7,3 September 2021,"When U. S. Army Private Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damme) kills his psychotic, sadistic, rampaging Sargent, Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) during the Vietnam war he too is killed when Scott lands killing blow before he dies. Both men are listed as M. I. A. To cover the bad optics of Scott's rampage against the Vietnamese civilians and Deveraux and Scott's corpse's are taken elsewhere by the government. In present day, a new elite special ops unit known as the Universal Soldiers (or UniSols) has been created by the U. S. military for use as a counter terrorism strike force that is comprised of re-animated soldiers including Scott and Deveraux. TV journalist, Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker), learns the secret of the UniSol program and after being confronted by the UniSol team lead by Scott, Scott starts reverting to his trigger happy self which in turn triggers Deveraux's past memories who breaks from the UniSol unit and goes on the run with Roberts to protect her. With the UniSol team in pursuit, the chase becomes more intense as Scott's conditioning wears off and becomes hellbent on killing the both of them.After appearing in some lower budgeted features such as Black Eagle and No Retreat, No Surrender, Jean Claude Van Damme broke into headlining action films with his break out roles in Bloodsport and Kickboxer which helped establish him as a credible action star despite critical derision. Director Roland Emmerich had tried to break into the American film industry for years with showcases such as Making Contact or Moon 44 clearly intended for an international audience but were mainly relegated to obscurity on home video. For both Van Damme and Emmerich, Universal Soldier was not only a big hit but helped push both individuals careers over the edge with Van Damme's status elevated to international levels of appeal and Emmerich given the credibility to establish himself in Hollywood that would bring him to larger scale projects further in his career. While Universal Solider serves as an important marker in both the careers of Van Damme and Emmerich, it helps that despite being a rather silly film, it's also Damme entertaining.Produced by Mario Kassar and made through his production company Carolco who also produced the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Universal Soldier has been compared to Terminator, the comparison is certainly justified what with the lead actor whose second language is English and a film where the lead character is set up in such a way as to excuse the robotic delivery, but unlike Terminator that offered intelligent takes on time travel and played itself pretty straight, Universal Soldier has no such airs about it as it knows it's an inherently silly premise and does its best to have fun with itself without teetering over into full on parody. Van Damme is often called out for not being the great of an actor and unlike Schwarzenegger who took a knowingly self-aware approach to his very noticeable accent, Van Damme would often create excuses for his accent often playing Cajun or French/French-Canadian characters to try and build credibility around his manner of speaking rather than ignoring it. While Van Damme doesn't have that self-awareness that made Schwarzenegger a more versatile presence, there's something endearing about Van Damme how earnest he'll play a role be it in previous films like Lionheart or Bloodsport but especially here where he does have this ""out of time, out of place"" charm that's being taken seriously in his performance while still allowing for moments of humor.The rest of the cast is also quite fun with the movie's ""big bad"" in Dolph Lundgren's Andrew Scott being a delightfully insane ""boo hiss"" villain who chews the scenery to almost comic book villain levels of insane with his penchant for making necklaces out of ears and his casual cruelty used to good effect for some darkly comic bits in the film. The best performance by far comes from Ally Walker as reporter Veronica Roberts who has some good chemistry with Van Damme and makes a good audience proxy and foil for Van Damme as she tries to survive and keep her wits about the explosive and messy chaos she's wondered into.Roland Emmerich shows some really great work in his first American film production, with a good eye for action set up, good establishment of spatial geography, and while his sense of humor is undeniably cheesy (a lasting hallmark of his films) there's something about his approach to humor that I can't help but smile at even when I know it's corny. The movie is a quick sit at 90 minutes and keeps itself moving at a good clip never allowing itself to drag or weigh itself down with unnecessary bloat. The action sequences are well placed throughout the film in a good rhythm of build-up, release, decompression, and repeat so the movie never becomes exhausting to sit through.Universal Solider is a cheesy sci-fi actioneer that I just can't help but love. With two charismatic action leads giving their roles all their energy and then some, coupled with a good supporting performance from Ally Walker who adds that grounding element to keep audience investment it's a terrific cast who give their all. Roland Emmerich displays strong presence behind the camera and with a playfully silly approach to the material it never overburdens itself and allows itself to be an enjoyable and exhilarating experience.",Universal Soldier
44,ODDBear,"Good action film, Van Damme's best",7,15 September 2005,"I just wanna say that I have a real soft spot for the 80's action heroes that I watched relentlessly when I was growing up. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Seagal and yes, to some extent, Van Damme. The Muscles from Brussels was always my least favourite but I usually checked out his films. I don't think any of them are REALLY good but I've always liked this one very much. Sure, it's pretty dumb for the most part but it has a distinct advantage over most of his films; IT'S ALSO GOT DOLPH LUNDGREN. Now, I just remember him so vividly in Rocky 4, and being as young as I was when I first saw it; I remember cheering him on, and being immensely sad when he lost.Universal Soldier has a good opener, introducing Van Damme and Lundgren as Vietnam soldiers (Lundgren a total nut and Van Damme a good soldier) who wind up killing each other. Decades later, they end up becoming part of a zombie ultra military squad who are controlled by the government. But they snap out of it, come to life and go head to head once more, since they have some unfinished business.Now, the story is no Oscar winner, but it's fairly original and sets the motion for some great action sequences and a very entertaining good vs. evil battle between Lundgren and Van Damme. If only the Ally Walker character could have been made a bit more tolerable (and less a cliché) we'd nearly have a total winner.All in all, the action scenes are great, Lundgren is terrific, obviously having a field day playing his role and Van Damme is alright, but then again, he's never been great.Universal Soldier is Van Damme's best film and quite easily recommended for action fans.",Universal Soldier

Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren together in one film doesn't exactly bring up expectations of quality. However Universal Soldier manages to be far more entertaining than one would've guessed and not even in guilty pleasure way. The action is rather spectacular and while Van Damme and Lundgren are rather well suited to their parts.

After a personal and political dispute regarding the execution of some Vietnam prisoners, Van Damme and Lundgren kill each other, but are preserved in ice and then resurrected years later as Universal Soldiers - Unisols for short - hi tech government weapons of mass destruction, and they are just two of a few. Naturally things go awry when the two remember their past, with the colonel in charge naturally refusing to take them off line when the scientists say they should be pulled for a systems check. Throw in Ally Walker as a sexy, sexually repressed reporter who doesn't work and play nice with others, and you've got the recipe for an engagingly trashy action film featuring the clash of titans who can barely speak English.Having grown up with Dolph Lundgren as He-Man in 1987's ""Masters of the Universe"", there's something extremely not kosher about watching him play a bad guy, especially with the way he relishes lines like ""I'm all ears.""

It is my third best favorite Van Damme movie! It has Dolph Lundgren in it and I love this movie to Death!!! Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundrgren are awesome in this film. Action and fighting sequences were awesome till today Roland Emmerich did made a great job as the director of this action sci-fi film flick. Every time I see this action flick I am not bored with it and is definitely Van Damme's best action movie. I enjoy the action, I mainly love this movie, because it focus on Vietnam War and it has experiments that US military actually really secretly did that. The fights scenes between Van Damme and Lundgren were awesome! This is the only movie that I care and love about! All the sequels to me sucked ass! None of them can hold a candle to this movie! Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren reunited 20. years later after working together in here, in the film ""The Expendables 2"" (2012) my favorite action packed movie. This movie is a bad ass and kicks ass! I love it so much, I even prefer above Kikcboxer and Double Impact. This is the movie that I love. I love all the actors in this movie, Ally Walker was a great cast as reporter Veronica Roberts. Chandra West who played her in TV movies couldn't even hold a candle to Ally Walker./:Ally Walker was also cast as Dr. Samantha 'Sam' Waters in my favorite TV Show Profiler. ""ARE WE HAVING FUN YET?"" Hell yes.The best science fiction action film ever made. It still holds up great to this day. Whenever I watch this movie I am having fun. A really fun inventive action flick with some really kick ass fight scenes and a sense of fun about it, that makes it irresistible. Van Damme and Lundgren were great in this and it really is a shame that despite this being a hit Lundgren still did not get out of direct to video land and continued to get overlooked by Hollywood after the film's release. This movie it is the film that made Van Damme in to a star and saved his career. It is so aggravating how far they rushed with the sequels. At least we still got the one amazing movie that made Dolph one of the greatest villains ever, well maybe not a ""villain"" a but a real bad ass! I like the aspect of the cool down process and the story is easy to understand. Also, Dolph Lundgren's scene in the grocery store is one of my all time favorite scenes in any movie. I really love this movie to death. Alongside Hard Target and Bloodsport, Universal Soldier is my third favorite Van Damme movie. I don't care what anyone say's or thinks about this movie, I will not listen to them, I will listen to my self! When I was 13. years old, I was in the hospital talking with my new friends about this movie, that I have made them there, when I was lying on the bed. That time, I never watched or heard about this movie before and they told me how great it is. They where right, it took me few months till I finally watch this movie on TV and I absolutely loved it. This film for me has a great memories on my childhood. This is the basic plot about the film it has death soldiers, that turns in to a cyborg killing machines that are anti terrorist and their experiments goes awry wrong and they start killing innocent people and only one man, a machine can stop them. The final battle scene between Van Damme and Lundgren is epic! Van Damme uses his awesome spin kicks with his legs, that we already saw in Bloodsport, Kickboxer and Double Impact. The meat grinder scene is, when Scott is crushed and killed, that was really a bad ass scene! I am giving this movie my perfect 10, because it deserves it and Roland Emmerich did a great job directing this movie. I can watch this movie over and over again. Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren did a both a perfect solid job playing their characters. I love them!",Universal Soldier
51,Maziun,"Grim , idiotic and joyless trash action from the 90's",2,15 September 2014,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSThis is REALLY poor man's ""Robocop"" or ""Terminator"" , with no sense of style , substance , intelligence or fun that appear in those classic science fiction movies. Directed and written by Roland Emmerich - one of the worst movie makers in history - what could you expect ? The fact that for some people this is a great classic action movie really tells you about their bad taste and questionable intelligence.The story has no depth or humanity . Unlike Murphy's story in ""Robocop"" it doesn't go anywhere . The Lundgren character could have been a tragic one instead he is wasted as one dimensional villain. Don't also expect any substance here. The story is just a excuse for the action scenes. If this was a B class movie , the whole cheesy story could be made with irony and for fun. It could have been a cult movie. Unfortunately this trash takes itself TOO SERIOUSLY from the beginning to the end. It is an incredibly grim film with no sense of humor - in it or about itself. And it is dumb - even for an action movie. A great action movies also have sometimes dumb moments , but there is a thin line between acceptable mistakes and pure idiocy. Few examples of complete disregard for audience intelligence : - Universal soldiers are SECRET weapons of US army , so they are traveling in special plane and truck that even blind would see -Universal soldiers can hit a guy people in the head from 500 meters with a silenced pistol, but miss the hero when they shoot him with machine guns at five meters range. - Universal soldiers move slower than zombies , yet underwater they can swim faster than a man can run and NOT get their clothes wet ! - Universal soldiers are sensitive to heat , so they are wearing padded jackets - A journalist simply walks in the secret military complex - Van Damme would rather steal an used car than army truck - Army leaves a truck with no protection at all - Lundgren knows in which car EXACTLY he should hide -Van Damme can't remember how to eat , but he knows how to buy a bus ticketThe acting is rather bad. Ally Walker is just awful as the cliché independent journalist . Van Damme is tolerable as man child with Pinocchio complex . Lundgren is not bad as the villain/killing machine). He brings some joy to this train wreck.Emmerich's direction is terrible , completely flat , failing to create even a speck of tension or excitement. The final fight is terribly cliché. The humor is clumsy and cringe worthy , worthy of a village moron. Avoid it . It's a total trash only for action movie junkies. I give it 2/10.",Universal Soldier

54,Bogmeister,Two super soldiers into one won't go!,6,23 July 2005,"When this action pic came out in '92, it seemed an obvious effort to emulate the 2nd Terminator pic of the previous year, right from the previews. Both in tone and subject (action spliced with some sci-fi), the picture does a good job of copying James Cameron. In a way, if you copy ""Terminator 2,"" you can't really go wrong - at worst you end up with a slightly pale imitation. It was also a minor casting coup to get Van Damme squaring off against Lundgren; those two both peaked in their careers as action stars around this point. Both also give better-than-expected performances (in other words, better than awful), injecting some needed humor, so that Ally Walker didn't have to carry that part all by herself. Lundgren, in particular, seems to be enjoying himself. Though there's some cartoon-style violence, there's also enough bloodshed that Lundgren poses a real threat at some points - he really does look like someone who can snap your neck too easily. But getting back to the violence, it veers sideways a bit in the climactic fight; I heard they re-shot this to extend it and give it more 'oomph' but it's still the weakest portion of the picture, full of clichés, like Van Damme standing up in slow-mo after he's supposedly had it. But it does have a strong beginning, carrying vestiges of the Vietnam War, and you get a slight chill when the 2 dead soldiers are reintroduced in modern times. And when they zip up those body bags in Vietnam, seeming to close the story on the 2 before it even begins, you may think, this could be good. It kind of was.",Universal Soldier

It's one of his greatest movies around.Unfortunately, Universal Soldier, doesn't get the recognition it truly deserves - maybe because of the films which followed after. Or maybe, it's a science fiction movie, but either way, it's still a fine film in itself.You could also again argue to say that this movie is ""universally epic"" too. That's how good Universal Soldier was. It's literally a battle of two soldiers.I also learnt something else in regards to this movie. Something really interesting. This is after all one of many movies within the Universal Soldier franchise - that should give you a little clue. It's Universal Soldier: The Return. This movie, believe it or not, is actually a direct sequel to Universal Soldier, despite all the movies which followed afterwards.Forget the superheroes for now. What people are really forgetting are these ""action heroes"". Universal Soldier portrayed one of these action heroes, and he's in the name of Jean Claude Van Damme, who happens to be one of the very best.",Universal Soldier

57,Antagonisten,A mess,4,19 January 2005,"This movie has probably reached fame mostly because it brings together two of the major giants of 1980's action movies: Jean-Claude van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Other than that there is little to be excited about.Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude) and Andrew Scott (Lundgren) are both part of a secret military project that involves reanimated soldiers. Their dead bodies are put back to life and their brains programmed to be the ultimate soldiers. But it seems not all memories from past lives are gone, and soon there are problems with insubordination.Considering this movie does feature no less than two real action stars there is surprisingly little action going on. Sure there are action scenes in the movie, and a whole lot of quite gory violence. But the adrenaline rush never comes, the pulse never really speeds up. Mostly this is due to poor direction and poor action sequences. The wooden acting of the two main characters fit the movie (they are reanimated corpses after all...) and the story is believable enough in an ""80's action flick"" sort of way. But there is something missing and i don't know what it is.When the movie is over i am left with a feeling of disappointment. This should have been so much more. A classic maybe. But it was not even one of the better movies in it's genre. A lot of noise for almost nothing. I rate this 4/10.",Universal Soldier
58,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,4 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...I remember when this movie came out, all the naysayers were knocking it as being a ""Terminator"" wannabe. I'm just gonna dismiss that one right now. If that is all they got out of it, then that is their loss. Why? Because a UniSol is hard to kill? That is where any and all similarities end. The other buzz surrounding this film back in the day was with its casting. Van Damme and Steven Seagal were the two biggest martial arts action stars at the time, and we were all clamoring for a Van Damme -vs- Seagal movie. Well, we never got one, but we did get this one with Van Damme -vs- Lundgren. And it didn't disappoint.After two soldiers, Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) and Andrew Scott (Lundgren), kill each other while in Vietnam, the government came in, put them on ice and entered them into a secret anti-terrorism program called Universal Soldier - where dead soldiers are reanimated years later to become order-following, mindless, fighting machines. However, when Deveraux begins to recall memories of the tragic Vietnam event, he finds himself in search of who he really is, aided by an inquisitive reporter named Veronica (played by Ally Walker). Hot on his trail is Scott, who thinks he is still in the war and considers Deveraux to be a traitor.This was a super, action film highlighting two of the biggest names of their day. The direction was tight, the cinematography was spot on, the action sequences were well done, and the acting was actually pretty good here - especially by the supporting cast who really embraced their roles. Dolph Lundgren was believable in his role as the insane army sergeant. And the final payoff, the confrontation between them, was totally worth the time invested.I highly recommend this one. It is without a doubt one of Van Damme's best films and the same can be said for Dolph Lundgren. It spawned numerous sequels over the years, some decent, others not so much. I am a big fan of early 90's movies - especially when it comes to action, and this was one of the best ones. A very strong 8 stars out of 10.",Universal Soldier
59,drewnes,"""You're dead soldier...""",8,30 May 2021,"Compared to Terminator 2, I would give this a 3. But since I am judging it on it's own as a JCVD movie and nostalgia, this is getting bumped to a 4. It is a lower budget terminator style movie and JCVD and Dolph Lundgren are great in it. Cheesy? Yeah. Is it also violent, funny and have epic scenes? Yeah! This is a JCVD classic and I am here for it!",Universal Soldier
60,Flagrant-Baronessa,An action classic,7,29 June 2006,"Muscles from Brussels and the Swedish man-of-war Dolph Lundgren team up as superhuman soldiers brought back to life from Vietnam in this movie. I'm not sure what it is exactly that they do  I wasn't paying attention. But I'm pretty sure it's something about struggling with obeying the orders from their commanders and having flashbacks from their past lives. What I know is that they do fight a lot. They also fight civilians. They even fight each other, and that's when things start to get very entertaining.It is only fair to watch this movie at least once since it has brought us not one, not two, but THREE sequels. What's even more awesome about these sequels is that they are all rated under 3.5 but not by enough votes to get them on the bottom 100 list on IMDb. If you fail in getting on a list like that, you even fail at failing and that is admirable. Universal Soldier is much more well-liked and higher-rated and rightly so.I do not recall who, but another film critic put it best when he pointed to how different Universal Soldiers was from your average science-fiction movie. To summarize this, where most sci-fi movies get to the part where all the complex science needs to be explained by some brilliant professor, Universal Soldiers simply offers the explanation ""we hypercharged their bodies to turn dead flesh into living tissue."" And that's how dead soldiers were reanimated into superhuman killing machines. Brilliant. There's no pretension  just take it or leave it.I can't find it in my heart to give this movie anything less than a 7 based on what it set out to do. Even though the acting is atrocious, the script is a joke and the dialogue is stupid, it's still a classic in my opinion. It had some intentionally funny moments like when Van Damme was in the diner and ate like ten meals of ""today's special"" and everyone was staring at him. If you don't find stuff like that funny, you have to watch it strictly tongue-in-cheek and just go for the brainless early-90s style action and cut-rate explosions. 7/10",Universal Soldier
61,Rautus,One of the best action movies,10,20 March 2007,"Universal Soldier is one of the greatest action sci-fi movies I've seen and with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren it makes the film even more good.The Universal Soldier gear is really sci-fi looking and great, the eye gear is one think I love about the suits plus the Armor itself.The action is some good stuff with the shooting and the fighting, both being Martail Artists makes the fight scene seem more real. The acting is good, the guys playing the Univerasl Soldiers really make it work.Universal Soldier is one of those action classics like Terminator 2 that has a good plot and action. If you like action films like Terminator 2 then you should check this one out.",Universal Soldier
62,Cinemaniac1984,"Ignore the critics, Universal Soldier is pure action packed entertainment.",8,9 January 2016,"Universal Soldier is one of those violent action movies that is much maligned amongst a lot of critics but still popular amongst audiences. Released in 1992, Universal Soldier was a box office success however critics dismissed it as a mindless and derivative action film with over the top violence. I first saw Universal Soldier when it first premiered on TV as a 10 year old back in 1994 and I have always considered this movie to be a fun an entertaining movie. Not only that, you cannot deny that Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren as the star leads boosted its eye candy appeal.Universal Soldier starts off in Vietnam in 1969 where Private Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damme) has discovered a village in which US soldiers and Vietnamese villagers have been brutally murdered with their ears severed off. The person responsible for the massacre is the platoon Sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren in a cracking performance as the villain) who has kept the severed ears as a necklace and is also holding a young Vietnamese couple hostage. Luc Deveraux tries to reason with the deranged Andrew Scott however the couple end up being killed and both Deveraux and Scott shoot each other to death. Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second U.S. Special Forces squad and cryogenically frozen, their deaths covered up as ""missing in action"". Deveraux and Scott are revived without memories of their previous lives and are selected for the ""Universal Soldier"" program, an elite counter terrorism unit. Also known as UniSols, they are genetically augmented soldiers with enhanced healing abilities and superior strength, but also have a tendency to overheat and shut down. They are given a neural serum to keep their minds susceptible and their previous memories suppressed. Fast forward to 1992 and the UniSols are deployed to resolve a hostage situation in which a number of armed hostiles are taken a number of hostages at Hoover Dam and have killed a number of hostages and police officers. Deveraux's callsign is GR13 and Scott has been assigned GR44. The situation is resolved however there is some flaws that start to surface, when Deveraux becomes unresponsive after having a flashback and Scott is seen using excessive force. One of the technicians, Woodward (Leon Rippy), wants to remove Devereaux for further analysis, but UniSol commander Colonel Perry (Ed O'Ross) refuses and insists there is no problem. After being fired, television news journalist Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) attempts to get her job back by trespassing onto the military base to further investigate the UniSol project along with her cameraman. After they are detained by Deveraux and Scott, Scott executes the cameraman in cold blood and Deveraux escapes with Veronica. Deveraux along with Veronica must uncover his past life and how he was resurrected, and how the Universal Soldier project came to light in the 1960's by Dr. Christopher Gregor (Jerry Orbach). Unbeknownst to Colonel Perry and everyone else, Scott slowly regains his psychotic behaviour and spearheads the mission to kill Deveraux and Veronica.A lot of people saw Universal Soldier as a rip off of the Terminator movies and the plot as unoriginal. I didn't see it that way nor was it a concern for me. I liked all of it. In particular, the butt kicking old school action was enjoyable and Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were fantastic as the main leads. Van Damme was still at his height of his popularity and his 360 kicks are still on display. Dolph's physical prowess was also at his best and he has still maintained his physical abilities many years later.Director Roland Emmerich who later became well known for blockbusters such as Independence Day (1996) and The Day After Tomorrow (2004) does a quality job in one of his early movies that helped gain him recognition.I didn't care for any of the sequels, they were just pure rubbish. Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) was one of the worst movies that I had the misfortune to see and I refuse to see the rest of the direct to DVD sequels that have since followed.Universal Soldier is pure action packed eye candy and you certainly can't go wrong with Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren as the main attraction. Although it may be a bit dated now, many years later I still have a soft spot for Universal Soldier. Ignore the critics and ignore the plot, just sit back and enjoy the action packed fun.8/10.",Universal Soldier

64,supertom-3,Great entertainment!,9,15 March 2003,"This may not be Shakespeare but it's certainly more fun. The film is basically elements of various other action movies and it works well. The key to this being the decent budget, the tongue in cheek style and the accomplished direction from Roland Emmerich (Independence Day).This is one of the few action films from Van Damme and Lundgren to really compete with Arnold and Sly in terms of production values, large scale set pieces and a sense of real fun, with the mindless and excessive violence. Van Damme is above his usual standard with a fairly subtle performance,let no one call it wooden. Ally Walker has charm and is watchable but it is Lundgren who steals the show with a delightfully villainous performance. Amongst fans they consider this one of his best roles.
The action is big, loud and well choreographed. With some fantastic set pieces, such as the opening Hoover Damn sequence and the chase between a prison truck and an armoured truck. There is also the obligatory showcase karate from Van Damme.Basically is you like a good action film you won't go wrong with this. This is at the time when the brainless action movies were still entertaining without being painfully un-original like modern popcorn films such as XXX, Exit Wounds and various others. ***",Universal Soldier
65,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,6 May 2005,"Probably both Van Damme's and Lundgren's best, Universal Soldier is one of the best action movies of the early nineties, with plenty of explosive stunts, fights, a decent story, some fine acting, and lots of great dialogue. In the wake of Terminator 2 this, and most sci-fi action movies look inferior, but this is a great watch for action fans, and should be seen by non-fans too as it is a good slice of entertainment.Van Damme stars as Luc Deveraux, a marine in 'Nam. His superior is Andrew Scott, played with menace by Lundgren. Their team stumbles upon a village in 'Nam where Scott goes on a kill crazy rampage, wiping out men, women, and kids, and when Luc tries to stop him, they kill each other. Flash forward to the nineties and the US Army has managed to save and restore both Luc and Scott an their team. The are now part man, part computer, easy to control soldiers with a much higher skill and strength rate than any human could have. The Army has created them for special missions and they have a flawless success rate. Veronica Roberts is a snoopy reporter who wants to follow the mysterious team, but can never get close. The soldiers are autonomous, doing whatever they are told, and with no memory of their past lives. However, as all computers inevitably turn against their masters, Luc and Scott begin to have flashbacks. Soon Scott has killed Veronica's cameraman, and Luc has saved her to become a renegade. He begins to remember everything and Scott takes control of his team with the sole objective of killing Luc and Veronica. The chase begins.Once we accept the Universal Soldier's abilities etc the story is all simple and will of course end with a final confrontation between the two stars. Between these two points there is a lot of action, gun fights, bombs, the usual, but it is done with a fair amount of skill and style. Van Damme does well as a cyborg and has little to say, but shows off his martial arts skills. Lundgren has less to say but is effectively sneering. Walker is the feisty heroine and gives a fine performance, and the rest of the cast range from grunts with guns to comedic parts. There is a good amount of humour which helps to make the film more appealing, and there is the inevitable Van Damme nudity. There are some interesting elements involving the Government's control of mindless soldiers, sending in faceless masses to do their dirty-work, but of course this is reading between the lines. Overall it is a simple, but effective and well-shot action film, and one of the best of its kind.8.5 out of 10",Universal Soldier
66,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Van Damme Vs. Lundgren - the best one bad-ass sci-fi action film of all time one of my personal third favorite Van Damme flicks,10,8 February 2019,"One of my personal favorite action sci-fi films of all time. Universal Soldier is my third favorite the best of Van Damme ever. I love this film to death, I love Jean-Claude Van Damme to death, I have no problems with this film. Hard Target, Cyborg and this one Universal Soldier for me are top 3 best favorite Van Damme films he ever did. I think this movie is great, awesome the best of the Universal Soldier films ever. Luc Deveraux / GR44 is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's favorite characters. he ever played - his favorite role of mine. Dolph Lundgren is Sgt. Andrew Scott / GR13 in this movie he wear a necklace of human ears. They are both soldiers ""Vietnam Vets"" who served tour of duty in Vietnam, I love that.Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren as US combat troops who after being killed in action during the Vietnam War, are resurrected in present day as genetically-enhanced super soldiers.Just like in Demolition Man Stallone Vs. Snipes, but in this movie it is Van Damme Vs. Lundgren in a bad-ass sci-fi action film. That is why these 2 action films I mentioned, I grew up with both of them. They are my personal favorite Sci-fi action films that I have grew up with those 2 films. There are reasons why this is my personal favorite action sci-fi flick. In 1997 I was 13 years old and I was hospitalized with pneumonia. There in a hospital I met some of the kids who become my friends and this movie become a major favorite subject. They told me about this movie that Van Damme did how great it is. We always talked about Van Damme and his movie Universal Soldier. Of course I haven't seen this film before, until my friends told me about it. The first time i see the film with excitement I was blown away how great it is. Jean-Claude Van Damme was our favorite subject and so was Jackie Chan. Universal Soldier was big part of me growing up my childhood that is why I love this movie so damn much.I love Sylvester Stallone and Jean-Claude Van Damme to death, I grew up watching them. Sgt. Andrew Scott/GR13 (Dolph Lundgren) uses M60 machine gun during the motel shootout and also in the Prison Bus escape. Lundgren uses M60 machine gun just like Stallone did in First Blood, (that is why I love First Blood to death - it is my personal number 1 action film). Sgt. Andrew Scott is on John Rambo with a machine gun for me. I love the bus escape scene in which Sgt. Andrew Scott throws grenades on the bus and shoots the driver. Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damme) takes a Smith & Wesson Model 39 pistol from the deceased Prison Bus driver and uses the handgun to shoot GR74 (Ralf Moeller) in the UniSol truck after the UniSol truck rammed the Prison Bus and was pushing it into the Grand Canyon. You have a great explosion in the film real practical effects. When Van Damme breaks the wall you can see it is a stuntman, but it was done for real it was done practical not CGI.The finale fight battle between Van Damme and Lundgren is one of the best fights in the film ever. I love Van Damme spinning kicks, flying kicks to Lundgren. I love the bond between Veronica Roberts and Luc Deveraux, I love how Veronica helped Van Damme finding his home back. I love the story in this movie in which these 2 soldiers kill each other in Vietnam and they are brought back to life 25 years later for a secret government program known as ""UniSols""- Both of them are genetically enhanced, unstoppable killing machines without memorie. But when Devreaux's memory starts to return and he escapes the program, a superhuman chase across the country begins. I love the idea about men a woman been chased I love that so much in the film.Roland Emmerich perfectly directed ""Universal Soldier"", he did a great job. This is my favorite Roland Emmerich movie with Independence Day and Godzila are my favorite Emmerich films. Ally Walker was a fine lady, she did a great job as the second lead role, I love the actress in this movie so much.Universal Soldier is my third personal favorite Van Damme action film one of the best one and it is a fun sci-fi action film I grew up with it. - Highly recommend it for action fans.",Universal Soldier
67,jonathanruano,Universal Soldier,4,6 September 2017,"We would all like to see a movie with the youthful Jean Claude Van Damme work, but the problem is that ""Universal Soldier"" is not a good film. The whole premise of the film is not new: the ""Universal Soldier"" is really a pale imitation of the Terminator from the 1980s and 1990s. Of course, an unoriginal premise would not be a problem if they did something fresh with the material. After all, Terminator Part II was a very good movie. Yet ""Universal Soldier"" really consists of a number of car chase scenes on desert high ways and Dolph Lundgren's heavy-duty jerk firing his big guns at Jean Claude Van Damme and his female companion, Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker). Is someone trying to overcompensate here with the big guns? You be the judge. There is very little suspense generated in these chases, partly because they are not well filmed and partly because the good guys never really seemed to be in any danger. Finally, there is the big fight at the end and I don't need to tell you who wins that one. The only element in the film that worked was Ally Walker who had some humorous and witty lines during her panic attacks, which made me smile. Unfortunately, Jean Claude Van Damme has even fewer lines than Ally Walker and is incredibly restrained and robotic throughout this picture. I realize that Van Damme has to be robotic as a universal soldier (that's the whole premise anyway), but they could have done something original with the material by showing how inept Van Damme is at understanding human emotions and behaviour. For instance, there is a hilarious scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator gets schooled by John Connor on why he cannot kill people (a robot programmed to kill people would not necessity make that leap in logic without some help). But Van Damme sadly is only there as a piece of furniture and for some pretty drab action scenes. As a result, Ally Walker almost by default nearly steals the show. One wonders in retrospect if Universal Soldier would have been a better film if it was about Ally Walker discovering the universal soldier program through investigative journalism than about the universal soldiers themselves.",Universal Soldier

It really is a bombastic and entertaining action movie, and probably a little underrated. It's very trashy entertainment, but loads of fun.Van Damme and Lundgren are front and center, and they steal the show with their good performances. Lundgren in particular is suitably over-the-top and evil, and works very well as the villain. He's actually a pretty good actor, as is Van Damme, and neither ever really got their due I feel, as they both chose to continue down the action movie route. Both have physicality and charisma, and look right at home.The story is pretty interesting, if a little mindless, and is nothing more than an excuse for lots of action, and for Van Damme and Lundgren to fight each other. It totally works.The action sequences are excellent and very cool. The hostage situation near the beginning was cool, the motel scene was good, the diner brawl was fun, and the car chase was slick. The final fight was the coolest action scene for me. It's violent and long, and over-the-top. This is an unapologetically 90s action movie, with lots of slo-mo and OTT effects. Van Damme also gets to show off his martial arts prowess, which is on full display in two fight scenes. The movie's actually pretty violent too, with lots of bloody and graphic moments.Definitely check this out if you're an action fan, if for nothing more then to see a well-made film in part of the golden age of action movies, and to see Van Damme and Lundgren in their prime.",Universal Soldier

The action sequences were great and I really liked that comical fighting scene in a bar. There are usually a colorful villain in Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies, this time it's played by Dolph Lundgren, and he is incredible in this film. This movie proofs what a great actor he is. I really think that this is the best role Dolph Lundgren ever had, or at least one of the bests.

72,AwesomeWolf,Dolph Lundgren + Jean Claude Van Damme = Awesome,8,3 March 2005,"I remember first watching 'Universal Soldier' on TV when I was about 8 or 9 years old. After that, whenever I saw it it didn't have sound, or I was rather inebriated, or both, or had other circumstances prevent me from appreciating the awesomeness of Van Damme v. Lundgren, until it was on TV again recently, and I got to revel in the glory of 'Universal Soldier'.Van Damme plays Luc Deveraux, a soldier serving in Vietnam, under the command of Sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren). Deveraux has an attack of conscience when Scott seems to lose his altogether. In fact, Scott seems to be somewhere between insane and plain evil. After Deveraux refuses - on Scott's orders - to kill innocent villagers, the two soldiers kill each other. Listed as Missing-in-Action, the bodies of the two soldiers are used in the Universal Soldier program, and the two are re-activated some time later as GR-44 (Van Damme) and GR-13 (Lundgren), supposedly with no memories of their past.When reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker) stumbles onto some things she shouldn't have seen (seriously, if you want to keep your project secret, you don't drive around in an armoured bus, leaving unlocked crates lying around outside), her cameraman is murdered by one of the UniSols. GR-44 has flashes of his past, and takes Veronica on the run, with the slightly (very?) unstable GR-13 in hot-pursuit.Action abounds for the rest of the movie, and while there isn't anything truly special, it is way cool, or even Awesome. We have car chases, heavy vehicle chases, Van Damme beating people up, and Lundgren being one of the awesomest bad guys ever. What is there to complain about? Nothing, that's what. I must say that Dolph Lundgren is at his best playing villains, and I'd even argue that his role in 'Universal Soldier' has been some of his best work to date. Van Damme also gets to credit 'Univeral Soldier' as being one his best movies.Plot-wise? Again, little - if no - originality, and a pretty thin plot. However, as I always say ""Less plot = More action = Awesome"", and everyone is happy, and if you don't agree, then you really should not be watching 'Universal Soldier'.I love 'Universal Soldier'. It stands close to the pinnacle of action B-movies, a genre everybody loves!

It's about two soldiers (Yes, van Damme and Lundgren) who got killed in Vietnam. Now, they're brought back to life as semi-robots or something like that.

There were some silly things about this film and this film does lack tenseness. The sequel Universal Soldier: The Return was a lot more tense and action packed and was much more better than this film. I'm not a fan of Dolph Lundgren but his very malicious and brutal characters dislike of Van Dammes character worked well but big improvements could have been made but weren't done. This film was good but could have been a lot better.",Universal Soldier

79,Svenstadt,"The working title was ""F 'em once, f 'em twice,"" but apparently that was politically incorrect!",2,9 March 2019,"This is one of the more ridiculous action films of the nineties. The girl in the film plays a reporter, and she is not appealing at all. Nor does she have any romantic interest with Van Damme.
The premise was the only intriguing part of this film, which tries to be too much at once and ultimately fails at everything.
I'd say Lundgren's character was the strong point. But he is not given enough screen time. The art direction and props are shoddy at best. More than that, you lose interest quickly.",Universal Soldier
80,SeriousJest,The bad kind of 90s action flick,3,3 April 2012,"This is a typical 90s Hollywood action blockbuster: simple plot, big  explosions, net down (see note 1 of this Grantland article for a good  definition of ""playing with the net down""), and big-name actors.  Unfortunately too many of the ""big-name actors"" in 90s action movies  were barely actors. Fitness sciences weren't as developed then, so a  diesel body could land you big roleseven if your acting ability was  suspect. Nowadays, a talented actor can put on 30 pounds of lean muscle  to play an action hero. Therefore, I'd much rather watch a modern,  more-intelligent, well-researched, more-realistic, better-special-  effects-enhanced action movie, starring more talented actorsalthough I  am a sucker for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone films,  because no matter how bad those guys' acting was, they'll always be  awesome to me. Van Damme and Lundgren don't have the same charisma,  however, and Walker was just plain annoying in this movieI liked her  much more in Sons of Anarchy.  Also, some 90s action flicks made up for bad stories, acting, etc. with  great martial arts. Unfortunately, the fight scenes in Universal  Soldier were unimpressive, as well.",Universal Soldier
81,maxmages,"The film was Roland Emmerich's entry into Hollywood, and I can see why.",6,15 January 2018,"Do you know that synonymous, if you only know a movie title because you know exactly that has 10,000 copies in the DVD store? (with 50 direct-to-video sequels or prequels)
That's just the case with ""Universal Soldier"", I just wanted to know how and where it all started. I also like to see martial artist trying on more serious film projects. But then I remembered ""Roland Emmerich"" and I knew what I had to get involved again.Surprisingly, that was not the case. That is clearly one of Emmerich's best films but that does not mean much.The story is pretty good in itself and I like the idea. In general, I'm always interested in any kind of weird science fiction but if you have not seen the first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie, then you might think it's just a normal soldier movie in which only a soldier went crazy.But in itself I have to say the movie is fun because it does not seem so long, has some pretty good ideas and Jean-Claude Van Damme is pretty entertaining and funny in so many scenes. That I really have to ask the question if this man would be a good comedian. My personal favorite is when he sits in yours and just no matter what happens all the food continues to eat and continue to eat.
Dolph Lundgren is always better as a rogue (or as an anti-hero)Nevertheless, we must not forget that this is a criticism and we must also remain critical the film has the typical Roland Emmerich problems. The pacing in this movie is rather slow. Now the action is filmed faster + good enough but the scene went by quickly before / after getting into a car. Otherwise you can wait a long time until something interesting / important happens again.
The battles are mediocre just like the love interest. (which one would not have needed in this movie but she has at least a narrative reason to follow him in the movie and it is at least understandable why they fall in love with each other)But the saddest thing is that the movie had 3 perfect scenes to end the movie and all the problems mentioned at the beginning would have been quickly forgotten, NO!
Terrifyingly, the movie continues over 20 minutes because Roland Emmerich tried to make a double climaxx, but he did not understand how to build one that makes him worse and harder to deal with in retrospect.

The witty one-liners, the plot twists, the great acting, none of that was lost, I am sure.This is a movie all about action. And action. And action. Did I mention action? Emmerich throws logic, acting and plot out of the window and takes the worst parts of ""The Terminator"". Plot Outline: Revived soldiers from Vietnam are used as a task force to combat terrorists. They can hit people in the head from 500 meters with a silenced pistol, but miss the hero when they shoot him with machine guns at five meters range.Explosions occur. Bad guys die. There is a bar brawl. Dolph Lungren displays bad acting. Jean-Claude van Damme displays worse acting. Emmerich laughs at people who buy this movie.That's about what I remember, except when the main bad guy was pierced on a farming tool and the hero made a witty remark, which sadly was lost in the translation.1/10.",Universal Soldier

The thing that will be etched in my mind the most is the way Lundgren displays his joy after he throws a grenade at Ally Walker.

A lot of the acting in this movie was not very good, considering that Van Damme and Lundgren are pretty bad actors, and the performances from Ally Walker, Ed O'Ross, and Jerry Orbach were decent but not their best.  What this movie does have is some solid action scene's, particularly the chase involving the bus and the soldiers truck.  It also had some decent fights and shootouts.

It's Dolph vs. Jean-Claude Van Damme and it has one of my favourite fight scenes in the history of cinema. Dolph's bad guy death is the greatest of all time: ""You're discharged Sarge"".It marked the beginning of the ascent for the mighty Roland Emmerich/Dean Devlin combo, as they showed their love of B-grade science fiction (dead soldiers brought back to life to fight!) with an assured hand at both carnage and comedy. Van Damme shines as a lethal innocent, a side to his acting that really helped to set him apart from the ever invulnerable likes of Seagal and Schwarzenegger. There's a genuinely sweet sense of naivety to Luc Deveraux, marked with the existential tragedy of being a man out of his own time, which makes his plight even more compelling, especially knowing that he was killed for trying to do the right thing. I hold that it's the same quality that makes Jet Li so great in the likes of Unleashed, but it's a role that really helped to humanise and differentiate Van Damme from the crowd. I'd be remiss not to mention the mighty Lundgren, too, as deranged Andrew Scott (a man, it seems, who just won't stay dead), who fills the running time with endless quotes that I'm still partial to impersonating, from ""Do you hear me?"" to ""It's empty!""

However, in the present, they are resurrected as Universal Soldiers, near-perfect warriors who combat terrorists.  Veronica, played by Ally Walker, follows the Universal Soldiers back to their base, where her cameraman is killed.  Luc has flashbacks, changes sides and helps Veronica escape.  But Scott also has flashbacks and makes it his mission to get rid of Luc.This film is filled with some great action sequences, and is Van Damme's best film that I've seen.  The acting isn't that great, but it doesn't need to be, as the main roles are emotionless warriors.  The action is incredibly fun, and I recommend this film, but not to people who can't stand too much violence.

90,aleksandarsarkic,Universal Garbage,3,23 May 2018,"Early 90's decade was most known for action and martial arts movies, they were very popular also here on the Balkans and i still remember how on television they just played movies with Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, Chuck Norris and others, our television channels still time to time play this kind of movies. I am admitting when i was a kid i really enjoyed action movies, i am still enjoying them time to time, when i want to relax and not to think of hard themes i always find something in this sphere to watch or rewatch, so these days i started to rewatch early movies with Jean Claude Van Damme. Of this early Van Damme flicks, Universal Soldier is most known of them. But in my opinion the worst one. I really enjoy campy and cheesy movies but this one, has nothing of that, it is just totally brainless and even the action sequences are badly done. And you also have one of the most annoying companion i have ever seen on movie, actress Ally Walker, i hoped she will die in some part of the movie but no she is there till the end. But when you see that this one is directed by one of the worst directors in history of cinema Roland Emmerich than everything is clear. I only give this movie the rate 3/10 because of the scene with Van Damme eating a tons of food in the drive-in, i laughed so hard, so stupid but funny.

91,Lt_Coffey_182,Dolph Lundgren provides memorable mayhem,8,14 November 2005,"Universal Soldier is an intense, non stop action film that has you hooked from the start. Roland Emmerich, as always, delivers a finely polished entertainment piece that pits two big action stars against each other in the best roles of their career. With Terminator 2 Executive Producer Mario Kassar being part of this film, quality was ensured (although not to the standard of T2).The gadgets and action sequences are what this film is all about and do well to distract from the far from original plot. With explosions and gunfights galore, this is an action seeker's dream as there is an exciting scene every few minutes. The UniSol Truck is a clever idea that makes for some great enjoyment later on in the film and also provides plenty of intense moments throughout. A truck that resembles a small military base is ridiculous but realism is not Universal Soldier's forte.Jean-Claude Van Damme is not a good actor and only this film and Hard Target are the only Van Damme films I've seen that are worth watching. In this film, he is uncharacteristically good. Like Arnie in The Terminator, Van Damme benefits from playing a sub human character, allowing him to get away with delivering his lines flat. Fight scenes are Van Damme's strong point and in this film, he is in great shape to dish out some butt whoppin' high kicks. Dolph Lundgren gives a standout performance and is one of the most enjoyable bad guys you can watch. His lines are fantastic and he shines with charisma all the way to the end of the film. Lundgren's screen presence is so domineering; he cuts a great image of someone you don't want to mess with. Whilst not the most demanding role for an actor, Sgt. Andrew Scott is a very memorable character and Dolph Lundgren does more than enough to bring him to life. It is great to see Van Damme against Lundgren as they are very different in stature and persona, and also have different fighting styles, which creates great contrast.Universal Soldier is not a film that will push any boundaries or be spoken about for years to come, but it is one of the most entertaining and well made films of this genre you'll ever witness. Watch out for Lundgren's psychotic, powerhouse performance which will have you in stitches and in amazement.",Universal Soldier
92,BestBenedikt,Mediocre but entertaining action flick,5,5 December 2018,"This very much feels like Van Damme's TERMINATOR with a stoic, somehow non-human main character that doesn't require a lot of range in terms of acting. Unfortunately, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is just not as good as Cameron's breakthrough.The movie has everything you would expect from an action flick of that time: A buff and kind-hearted protagonist, a seemlessly invincible antagonist, a blonde chick, a bar fight, lots of practical special effects that are nice to look at and brutal hand-to-hand combat between the opponents at the end of the last act. With that said, the film never really exceeds genre expectations.While UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is definitely watchable as a pure 90ies action movie, it ultimately falls flat compared to the action classics of its time.",Universal Soldier

Van Damme(at the top of his game in this) plays Luc, a Vietnam veteran brought back to life by a secret service to become one of many Universal Soldiers(UniSols). Dolph Lundgren plays Andrew Scott, a Sargeant in Nam who is also brought back to life to become a UniSol. Both men start to have flashbacks of there brutal deaths, which were at the hands of eachother. From here on its an all out two man war waged between Van Damme and Dolph. Van Damme does a good job at making you root him on and Dolph does an excellent job at being a villain, his charachter has lost it..this was Dolph's best movie and could have possibly been Van Damme's best too.

At the time, it was a relatively new concept (cyborg/ reanimated people) and that is what I think really drew people to this movie. I have just bought the DVD here in the UK hoping that I would still share my enthusiasm of seven years ago, but in all honesty I was not. There are some great action sequences - the dam and the final showdown to name a few - and all were beautifully choreographed. However, the fast paced plot of the first half hour really begins to die the moment most of the Uni Sols burn up, and afterwards you realise that it is basically another one of Van Dammes weak attempts at rivalling Arnie or Sly. As I said - the action is great, mainly due to having Vic Armstrong on board, but don't expect miracles.

The mercenary techs who run and maintain the zombie soldiers are cold and unfeeling, but when their creations turn on them they get all fearful and whining.But the following, which I guess you could call a SPOILER, is an indication that nobody did their homework when putting together the script...The Unisol project is supposed to be top-secret, and in fact not approved by any civilian or military authority. So how is it that Bimbette, the female presence in the movie, is reporting on the rescue operation that starts the film? Since this is a successful military unit (given the times, perhaps the only successful one) why didn't the President, or any of the Joint Chiefs, or anybody wonder where this unit came from and what was happening in it? Don't they watch the news, too?There are lots of action movies like this one, admittedly without even the B-list beefcake that was this film's major promotion factor.

100,louiepatti,Surprisingly Good For A Van Damme Vehicle/Minor Spoilers,8,21 June 2005,"Jean Claude Van Damme, like many other martial artists-turned-actors, simply cannot do much real acting. Like Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal, his acting is wooden, and Van Damme also has an accent thick enough to cut with a knife. However, sometimes even a poor actor can find a role to suit him, much like Arnold Schwarznegger as a cyborg in The Terminator. That seems to be what happened here: Van Damme found a role that worked well within his limitations, a role in which he unexpectedly shone.The movie is typical sci-fi/action fodder: Dead men are revived as virtually unstoppable soldiers. The viewer meets the two main characters in the opening sequence as soldiers fighting in Viet Nam. Van Damme's Luc Devereaux is a decent man doing his best to survive the brutal conditions of war with his soul intact. Dolph Lundgren's Andrew Scott is a psychotic reveling in the horrors around him, feasting on obscene cruelty with relish. The two opposites finally clash with predictable results: Good and evil annihilate each other like matter meeting antimatter. But these dead men are not left to rot in peace . . . for the military has developed a technology to recycle them as soldiers, Unisols to be exact, to be placed in harm's way in lieu of regular men. Powerful, emotionless and practically indestructible, these new universal soldiers are shown off by the brass in a difficult hostage-rescue mission, which the Unisols pull off flawlessly.All seems peachy. However, something during the rescue triggered a memory in Luc of his experiences in Viet Nam. He eventually deserts the unit, followed by the dangerous Scott, who has also recovered enough of his past to hate Luc and hunt him down. A self-serving reporter named Veronica helps Luc, at first for a story, then because she grows to care for this powerful yet childlike fish-out-of-water. She's caught in the middle when all hell breaks loose.Typical Van Damme fare . . . only it isn't. There's a strange charm to his character, a vulnerability and even hints of humor usually lacking in his acting. Van Damme conveys subtle emotions in his face, especially in his large gentle eyes. He's still at his best when fighting, but surprisingly good at playing this role. Oddly enough, the acting in this movie is one of its strong points, the other being special effects. The other performers are all solid, from Ally Walker as Veronica to Lundgren as the incredibly creepy Scott. The director was wise enough to work within the limitations of his leading man, so Luc's dialog is used sparingly. The fighting sequences are also well utilized, fitting in with the plot. Weaknesses include the plot, which is full of holes, and exposition of key elements, such as just how these fighting machines were created. The film at times had an abbreviated feel, as if too much information was truncated that should have been included in the story.Still, it remains overall a reasonably enjoyable film, even for non-fans of martial artists like me. Van Damme actually fit his role and was likable as the unlikely hero. Though it's considered sci-fi/action, this movie in truth occupies a strange niche, one not easily identified. Worth watching when not in the mood for the usual fare.",Universal Soldier

The fights scene were good between the both of them, especially the end fight. I thought that was brilliant. I really like the chase when Dolf Lundren was chasing JCVD in the jail truck.

As I write I am struggling to think of another movie that has done the government 'super soldier' programme in such a memorable way, back in the days of VHS and less choice I did watch this many times.The plot is not too far out there to get behind and I think most of the cast, even the small parts add their worth to the story. It's not really cheesy and is even quite gritty, Dolph Lundgren is very convincing as a scary dude you would not want to cross paths with (at the time I remember his portrayal of a religious nut bad guy in Johnny Mnemonic being THE scariest bad guy I had seen, maybe I might change my mind if watched again but I don't remember that movie being any good!).Back in the day I thought this movie was great, admittedly it has been some years since I watched it last but I would watch it again no question. To this day I still find myself quoting some of Dolph's lines and there are some gems as only action movies from the 80's and 90's could achieve.
""It's EMPTYYYY"" he cheerfully states while attempting to shoot one of the characters, and also ""See, they're everywhere"" after calmly and casually shooting four men. This film had humour, but it was dark, dark humour, it was Dolph's performance that provided this.This also had a great final scene line delivered by JVD, which I will not spoil.

107,RolandCPhillips,Admit it  you enjoyed it.,6,18 October 2004,"Okay, okay: it's as macho as hell, questionably acted, pretty brutal and not particularly imaginative. But it has faith in itself. Please don't think I mean to give this B-movie any real grandeur, but it does know how to get the blood pumping. If the action sequences are nothing new (cribbed from Arnie and Mad Max flicks), it pushes them home with a relentless logic, and the production values are fine.There is an element of self-parody, thanks largely to Lundgren's engagingly OTT psychotic turn (he's the best of the bunch) and the film-makers have enough nouse to make JVCD rely on his ability to kick the life out of everyone.Plot means nothing, the film is nasty, the semi-moral/sentimental tone that descends towards the end is pretty offensive and it's derivative.But admit it - you enjoyed it. Hell, I thought it was a laugh.",Universal Soldier
108,mikerichards,Two minutes in and the two lead 'characters' are dead. Sadly this doesn't last.,3,1 November 2001,"Health warning. If you read the following plot very quickly it might make sense. But it should be treated like quicksand. If you stop you'll be drawn down into the murky depths of idiocy. Now take a deep breath...The ever-devious US military has been collecting the still-warm corpses of its own Vietnam dead and then re-animating them with super powers (which any mad scientist would tell you is never a good idea). By injecting these zombies with some glow in the dark goo they conveniently forget everything and can be unleashed to defend freedom, democracy and bad plots everywhere. Jean Claude van Damme plays the hero who has to save a plucky reporter (Ally Walker) from the attentions of the US military and a rogue colleague played by Dolph Lundgren. After an interminable series of chases it all ends up as a nasty zombie versus zombie versus combine harvester fight.You can breathe again now.If you hadn't guessed, they passed on the original title of 'Zombie Commandos From Hell' and called them Universal Soldiers - a title so unwieldy that they are referred to throughout as Unisols.
Unisol? That isn't very scary; it sounds more like a haemorrhoid preparation. Which might just come in handy.If it had been a B-feature made on a tiny budget 'Universal Soldier' could have been played for fun. With a witty script and some sly in-jokes the whole thing could have become a camp classic. Unfortunately it is an incredibly po-faced film with no sense of humour - about itself or its cast. And it is dumb - even for an action movie. No care has been taken with basic plot development or continuity.Our top-secret stealthy commandos go round in a special plane and an even more distinctive truck (one that comes with Transformer-style pop-up sections and a dry-ice machine). Had they painted it green with flowers on the side and named it the Mystery Mobile they couldn't be more obvious. Each Unisol comes with a heads-up camera that appears to show the world through the exciting new medium of Teletext. Despite their super-powers they are sensitive to heat, so they are deployed to a desert wearing padded jackets (Sadly, this does give Jean Claude van Damme the perfect excuse to take his clothes off - again). When Unisols move, they stagger around like the Addams Family butler (and have you noticed how Dolph Lundgren and Lurch could have been separated at birth?), yet underwater they can swim faster than a man can run - AND NOT GET THEIR CLOTHES WET! Incredible stuff!Worst of all, there is a plot hole that is so obvious it is incredible no one noticed during production. Our heroes are trapped at a petrol station, the Unisol truck drives up, EVERYONE gets out of the truck and starts looking for them. Do our heroes (a) get into the cab of the truck and drive off leaving their enemies safely behind, or (b) go into the back of the Mystery Mobile and start looking for clues?Hint: don't choose (a).'Universal Soldier' is the freakish result of some genetically engineered script writing.  A demonic plan was unleashed to graft the undemanding half of 'Frankenstein' to an even less-demanding part of 'Terminator', all Carolco needed were two suitable leads to play the walking dead. They picked Jean-Claude van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. With the exception of the remarkable height difference between the two leads (and we are talking about at least a foot!) this has to be perfect casting.Unfortunately dream casting can't help a fatally flawed movie. It is a sad fact that it is very difficult to make zombie characters interesting; without any common reference the audience has no emotional involvement with the story. Zombies have largely been restricted to shambling around the woods chewing on teenagers; perhaps wisely no one has seriously considered them starring in a period piece opposite Kate Winslet or a romantic comedy with Meg Ryan ('When Harry Ate Sally' anyone?).There are two ways to make such characters interesting. One is to give them a tiny facet of humanity - the scene in Frankenstein where he meets the blind man, or the relationship between the Terminator and the child John Conner show how this can be pulled off successfully. The second is to play them as ruthless machines, bent on destruction (Terminator first time round).There is none of that in this movie, and it manages to miss both solutions. The attempted relationship between the newly human van Damme and Ally Walker is undermined by having him suddenly regain all his memories and playing the part of a normal human being with a Pinnochio complex. The man-child role is a challenging one for skilled actors, in the hands of someone less talented it is embarrassing. Want to guess what it is here?The second part is undermined by not keeping the bad guy as an unthinking machine. Lundgren's character suddenly regains his psychotic personality. This is clearly someone suffering from a medical problem, not the usual two-dimensional movie killer. A clever plot (think Frankenstein (the book)) might want to try and resolve the problem by playing on the human part of the character; a bad plot would have him kicked to death and chopped to pieces. Want to guess again?The second problem is the casting. Obviously Carolco couldn't afford the salaries demanded by Schwarzenegger and Stallone, so they had to pick from the B-squad, and it shows. van Damme rolls through this movie on the twin charms of having puppy dog eyes and showing his backside. Lundgren emotes his role with all the charm of a run-down Speak and Spell machine. (Which is odd, because when I've seen Dolph Lundgren interviewed he's witty and charming; but put him in front of the movie camera and you're wondering if someone has forgotten to flick the 'ON' switch).Individually they are painful to watch; together - excruciating.
It's not a complete loss on the performance front; if you watch very carefully you'll see that Ally Walker is in fact acting (and stands out a mile for doing so). Her lines are ludicrous, her character is painfully underdeveloped but Walker does a reasonable job of trying to play a halfway-realistic character. Sadly what starts off as an independent, successful woman is quickly reduced to bimbette status screaming on the sidelines. So much for feminism.Is there anything else to recommend this movie. No, not really, there is a neat abseiling stunt near the beginning and lots of stuff blows up, but for the first time in my life I would have to admit that not nearly enough stuff blows up.Universal Soldier's greatest contribution to movie history has to be that it helped sink Carolco. Cinema audiences stayed away in droves from this charmless production and it is perhaps best remembered for the desperate publicity 'fight' between Lundgren and van Damme at Cannes. The franchise spawned some sequels with ever decreasing budgets. The directors, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin went on to make two even worse, but somehow more successful movies - 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. The two leads descended to the bottom shelf of your local video store never to return. Ally Walker sadly vanished from our screens and you still can't buy cans of Unisol.'Universal Soldier' is best watched on a long cold winter's night when you don't want to go to bed and there is nothing else on television.But then again, have you considered taking up astronomy?",Universal Soldier

The plot makes no sense whatsoever! Some key parts in the movie look like they were wrote by one of my 3 year old children!  3. The dialogue makes you want to wonder if you got the version for people who have problems with comprehending words that are longer than two syllables.

114,tommonster3k,If only Dolph Lundgren were a mute.,5,3 April 2004,"As far as Jean-Claude Van Damme movies go (which usually range from average to awful), this is one of his best.  Still, it's only an average actioner, if an enjoyable one.Van Damme's troubled super-soldier doesn't say much, which is a good thing, as Van Damme has never been much good with dialogue.  He actually pulls off some rather good character moments, especially when he is learning how much he enjoys eating.Ally Walker's heroine is pretty annoying but calms down halfway through the picture and becomes more likeable.  The ""comic relief"" locals who own the various ill-fated pit stops on our heroes' fugitive road trip are downright unbearable.  I was just waiting for them to be turned into collateral damage.As for Dolph Lundgren, he will forever remain a wannabe action star.  The man has no charisma, and he's a few big clicks below Schwarzenegger and other tough guys at delivering one-liners.  If he'd kept his mouth shut in this movie, he'd have come off as a more menacing, less laughable villain, and the movie as a whole would've been that much better.There are some truly cheesy moments in this movie, as in all of Emmerich's sci-fi work, and it suffers from the usual Nam-flashback cliches, but it's worth seeing at least once.  5/10",Universal Soldier

For a long time this was Jean-Claude Van Damme's finest work (prior to Legionnaire), and it isn't difficult to see why. Universal Soldier stands out as an action movie because strangely an audience is emotionally drawn to the protaganist (Van Damme's Luc Deveraux), and sympathises with his situation and how he's been exploited by a secret government organisation. Complete with a bonafide formidable, pyschotic, loony villain in Dolph Lundgren, the film has some great action sequences, and a hard hitting showdown between Van Damme and Lundgren in the final reel.

Jean-Claude Van Damme is perfect for the hero against Lungren. It's always interesting how the small guy in the movie always beats up the bigger guy, like the Napoleon complex.

I actually watch this movie over and over to see the priceless expressions on Dolph's face. The action in the movie is non-stop and Dolph has some good one-liners that rival Arnold.

IMDb does only list a few of them but there was almost every minute another mistake that it makes you really wonder who could put the story together so woefully. I don't want to make a list (the movie makes me sick thinking about it) but just think about this fact: The US Army stations for an unapproved project (so it doesn't get any financiers) undead ice-troops in the middle of the desert but it comes to a personal war of honor and revenge when the before well controlled killing machines follow their own will.Folks, don't trust this movie!",Universal Soldier

But its presentation is pretty damn slick, through wild action, a fresh take on a science fiction wartime, and padded along with some decent comedy. The leading men as well bring to the film wonderfully acted parts; with perfect faces (and attractiveness) from Van Damme and a wild, creepy-in-its-maniacism energy from Lundgren. Not too bloody, not too campy, not too basic a plot line, Universal Soldier holds up pretty well against the minor plot holes.

125,communistgodzilla,Soldier of Facetiousness,7,29 December 2007,"Universal Soldier pits two 1990s B-movie action titans (Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren) against each other in a sci-fi action epic, that while extremely dumb at times, manages to be an entertaining romp just the same.The start of Universal Soldier takes us back to 1969, to the Vietnam war: GI Luc Devereaux (Van Damme) tries to stop his crazed sergeant, Andrew Scott (Lundgren) from killing some Vietnamese villagers; in the ensuing mayhem, Devereaux and Scott end up killing each other.Flash-forward to the present: Devereaux and Scott have been brought back to life - sort of - as part of the Universal Soldier program, an elite, top-secret outfit that goes around thwarting terrorists and whatnot. Each of the Universal Soldiers (""UniSols"" for short) have no memory of their past lives; they're basically zombie-like puppets following orders over a radio.After taking down some terrorists at Nevada's Hoover Dam, Luc's memory is triggered and he has flashbacks to his previous life. One thing leads to another, and soon Luc is on the run with a plucky TV news reporter (Ally Walker) in tow; hot on their trail are the rest of the Universal Soldiers: the commanders want to get their property back and keep the collateral damage to a minimum, but Scott views Devereaux as a deserter and a traitor and wants him dead. Hmmm, it seems like someone else is remembering the good old days...What follows from here are a series of gun battles, chases, vehicular mayhem, fist-fights, and massive explosions as Luc tries to figure out his past and get home, while Scott tries to spoil the party. Everything is basically a setup for the inevitable big martial-arts finale between the two stars, and while the action in Universal Soldier isn't revolutionary, it's well-staged and choreographed by director Roland Emmerich, and there's lots of it. Universal Soldier has some flaws, but being boring isn't one of them.What else Universal Soldier has going for it is a sense of humor, which helps gloss over some of holes in the Terminator-styled plot. Universal Soldier is a funny movie at times, thanks in no small part to Lundgren's over-the-top villain turn; he's surprisingly effective in the ""heavy"" role, gleefully giving it his all. Universal Soldier would have been a considerably weaker movie if Lundgren wasn't in it. Try not to laugh during Lundgren's big monologue in the grocery store; kudos to the director for allowing the store's muzak to keep playing during this Oscar-worthy clip.Van Damme is funny too, albeit in a deadpan/earnest kind of way. He's more of the straight man in this one; a wise choice, as it keeps his wooden thespian tendencies in the background. His scene in the roadside diner - where he ""just wants to eat"" - is probably the most humorous bit in the movie, though.It's hard to tell how much of the comedy in Universal Soldier is intentional, but an action movie with a sense of humor is only a good thing.Universal Soldier has a mostly-solid mix of action and laughs, but it does fall down in other areas, like plotting and acting. The storyline is predictable, with its main themes being lifted from better flicks like RoboCop and The Terminator. There are also logic gaps and plot holes that are kind of hard to ignore. In the acting department, save for Lundgren and Walker, no one really registers; sure, nobody watches Van Damme and Lundgren movies for the great emoting, but most of the secondary characters in Universal Soldier are one-note archetypes (nerdy scientists, hot-headed commander, redneck sheriff, etc.) who don't get much development or meaningful dialog.Still, Universal Soldier is a mostly-effective action flick that should satisfy fans of movies like this.",Universal Soldier
126,eguspielberg-1,Erase this from your memory,3,9 October 2007,I read all the great comments about UNIVERSAL SOLDIER and i don't agreed. For me this movie could a great science fiction-action flick and is not. The performance by Van Damme and Lundgren are pathetic and the plot is original but totally predictable. I admire the career of Roland Emmerich; he have a great imagination but with films like ID4 and STARGATE I think that this director must forgot this one from his portfolio.

134,spit,Best Van Damme Quote in ANY Movie!,4,29 December 1998,"I recently caught this movie again off the satellite, and was reminded how delightfully bad it is.  It does have its share of good one-liners, as any respectable film of this genre must have.  The best quote must be that of Luc (Jean-Claude) when he's pigging out (and concurrently kicking some serious trucker ass) at the roadside cafe: ""I just want to eat!""  To claim that the characters (Vietnam casualties reanimated into super-GIs) in this movie are one-dimensional is gracious.  If Luc's mantra in this movie is ""Make lunch, not war"", then that of his nemesis Scott (played by action buffs' favorite Scando, Dolph Lundgren) is ""Lend me your ears"".  Don't expect him to return them anytime soon...Here's a tip:  if you're looking for some bad, boys-night-out drive-in fodder, Universal Soldier might fit the bill (although you may find it ranks disappointingly low in the T&A column).  If, however, you're looking for a serious movie - with clandestine Vietnam-era plots of making more efficient human killing machines - definitely check out Jacob's Ladder.

140,Samantha-3,A good Action movie.,8,25 September 1998,"Universal Soldier is a solid Action movie. It has all the desirable elements, a decent story line, violence that isn't overly gruesome, some hot bodies and some good acting.I enjoyed this movie immensely and recommend it to everyone as long as they don't mind a little violence.",Universal Soldier
141,Cedebled,Wake me up for a movie,8,11 April 2001,"I think this is Van Damme's best movie.Nostalgia!A real macho movie that contains a story that is not bad. I really like the way the movie starts. I think that when a movie starts back in time like x-men, people become interested in what will follow.I have seen it several times. The movie still gives me a kick every time I watch it. It is like others say violent, but it containes more the that, and that makes it interesting(((Don't watch universal soldier the return)))
Do watch regeneration :-)god dam wat a bad english.",Universal Soldier
142,howell2890,"Great movie, kicks butt, great performance by Jean-Claude Van Damme",10,26 October 2001,"Universal Soldier is a different movie.  It is categorized in the genre of Sci/Fi, but I don't care what it is, this movie kicks butt!  When I first saw it, the first thing I thought was, I know that this movie will be around for a long time.  Here it is almost nine years later.  If you don't like Sci/Fi or action thrillers, then watch it to see the great performance that Jean-Claude Van Damme gives.",Universal Soldier
143,victor_joseramos,van damme rules,10,17 December 2003,One of the greatest movies ever. Van Damme kicks ass in this movie. The greatest part in this movie is when he can't pay for the food in the dinner and he fights everybody and kicks their ass all over the place.,Universal Soldier
