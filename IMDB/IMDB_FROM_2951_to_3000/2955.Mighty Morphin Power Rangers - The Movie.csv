0,TheLittleSongbird,"At the end of the day, it is actually mindless fun!",6,4 August 2009,"Okay, if you forgive the banal dialogue and the plot contrivances, plus the fact the film tends to become silly and cheesy, it is really mindless fun aimed at kids. Yes the script is weak, and the story is suggestive of an extended TV episode, and does get very silly at times. Despite all this, it does have a sense of fun, and not as bad as the rating makes it out to be. The music is good, and an unrecognisable Paul Freeman as the villainous Ivan Ooze is surprisingly good, with some excellent delivery of the film's best lines. Ooze is not only scary but incredibly funny as well, and Freeman the great actor he is nailed that on the head. The performances on the whole are decent, certainly not Oscar worthy material, and there are some well staged fights, even if the effects are nothing special. I will confess I don't like the TV show that much, but despite the failings that this film has, it is fun to watch. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
1,Smells_Like_Cheese,Brings back so many memories,10,1 November 2007,"1994 was the year of the Might Morphin Power Rangers, I was only 9 years old and was such a huge fan. I remember the summer of 1995 my friends and our parents took us to see The Might Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie and we thought it was the greatest movie ever made. I know that's sad, but we loved the show and the movie lived up to a great episode with an even better budget. I hadn't seen the movie since '95, but my boyfriend and I went to Target and found this movie on the $5.50 shelf and I grabbed it for old times sake since he was also a Power Rangers fan when he was a kid. We watched it and I have to say that despite how bad it is and how mega cheesy the lines and acting are, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is what it is. It was aimed at kids and was terrific for them, the story was so bad that it was actually good.The rangers are living their lives in the fast lane, they're sky diving and roller blading, I mean is there anything they can't do? But anyways, all that is put on pause when Zordon warns the rangers of Rita and Zed's evil plan to raise Ivan Ooze. Ivan is planning to take over the world when he shrinks Rita and Zed and is putting all the kids parents under a powerful spell to make them do his bidding. Ivan then visits the command center and destroys it leaving Zordon in bad shape and now the rangers have to save the world on top of saving Zordon and become the powerful ninjas to regain their powers and defeat Ooze.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is extremely silly and cheesy, but I don't know what people were expecting when they watched it that it got such a bad rating. It's one of those movies that is so bad that it's actually good. Although Zordon's face will haunt my dreams for a long time, it was classic the way the ""actors"" who played the rangers presented their lines, I loved how they would fight and do back flips, yet could say their lines perfectly without sounding out of breath. Also how they replaced certain rangers with people who looked like they were picked out of a kick ball team line. But Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is a classic film I think in a sense and will be a true time capsule of 1995.10/10",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
2,FeastMode,my notes,3,24 July 2019,"This movie is laughably terrible, but i still like some of it. major nostalgia. and these ninjas in cool suits fighting is pretty awesome. it's also hilariously bad. nothing makes sense. the writers must have said this a lot: ""who cares, it's for kids, they won't notice,"" the stuff on the other planet was hysterical. the whole parents plan was hysterical. but the power rangers are still awesome lol. and i still heart kimberly. and tommy is still a bad-ass... sort of. and billy is still lame. the CGI at the end was astonishing. i couldn't believe it. why would you include that if that's what it looks like. maybe they ran out of money when they were creating these images post production. this movie should really be a half star. but... go go power rangers (about 3 viewings)",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
3,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,18 June 2017,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The MovieWhen you manned a vehicle in the 1990s that fused together to become an enormous robot everyone just called you Voltron.Luckily, this fantasy film assuages any similarities between the super robots.When the witch Rita and her master Lord Zedd unearth an ancient egg, they unleash the purple despot Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman) on Angel Grove: home of the Power Rangers (Amy Jo Johnson, Jason David Frank, David Yost)Ooze promptly imprisons his evil benefactors before stripping the Power Rangers of their morphing abilities, and setting his own agenda on how to rule the Earth. Not only does this feature-length version of the popular TV show feature the original Ranger line up, but also their inept high school tormenters: Bulk and Skull. Faithful but with a cinematic edge, this adaptation provides more than adequate camp.Besides, morphing into a giant robot only looks cool when both legs show up.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
4,ironhorse_iv,"Uh-Oh! The movie is in trouble. Somebody came along, and burst their bubble! Still, it was alright fun. It's Morphin' Time!",5,30 August 2014,"When you think of the 1990s; the kid's television series 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' come across as one of the biggest pop culture phenomenon of that decade. It was so popular, that in 1995, a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie directed by Bryan Spicer was made. Much like the television season that followed the release, the film used concepts from the Japanese Super Sentai Series Ninja Sentai Kakuranger. The film is about, a group of teenagers turn superheroes fighting off evil monsters with robots. This time, they have to stop a terrible villain Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman) who wreaks vengeance on their mentor Zordon (Nicholas Bell) for imprisoning him years ago. With Zordon dying and their powers lost, the Rangers head to a distant planet to find the mystic warrior Dulcea (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) and gain new powers to help them stop Ivan Ooze. The film stars the regular television cast of the TV Series, post-season 2, pre-season 3, made out of Amy Jo Johnson as Kimberly Hart (The Pink Ranger), David Yost as Billy Cranston (The Blue Ranger), Johnny Yong Bosch as Adam Park (The Black Ranger), Karan Ashley as Alisa Campbell (The Yellow Ranger), Steve Cardenas as Rocky DeSantos (The Red Ranger), and Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver (The White Ranger). A lot of things had change since the first season. First off, the original cast had an African actor as the Black Ranger and an Asian actress as the Yellow Ranger. Because of the controversy of their descent, respectively, they were recast with a black actress as the Yellow Ranger, and Asian actor as the Black Ranger. Another problem was that, Jason David Frank's character got way too popular as the season 1 villain, The Green Ranger. He got so popular that the producers face-turn him in Season 2 as the new leader of the Power Rangers as the White Ranger. This lead to the original actor that play the original leader, the Red Ranger, leaving due to having a smaller role. Still, the people of Angel Grove still lack logic here. I like, how nobody knows that these teenagers are the Power Rangers. They wear the same colors, everyday like their power suits, and seem really good at martial arts. The movie had such a dramatic departure in visual style from the TV series, it's almost like seeing a completely different product altogether. I like how the power suits look like armor, than stupid those cheesy spandex jumpsuits. Sadly, they don't wear it, much. Another change was the Zoids AKA the robots, they used. I was deeply disappointed that the original Zoids didn't have a bigger part in this film. I wish, they could had at less, had one battle or something in the beginning. The power is ON! ...Perhaps someone should shut that off. It's running up the electrical bill. Anybody hoping to see them in the big screen had to be disappointed. Sadly, they run out of both Gosei Sentai Dairanger & Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger footage to use for the show, so they wanted to introduce the Ninja Zoids as soon as possible in the film. Still, season 3 of the power rangers just ignored the events of the movie and just create its own storyline of how the power rangers got their new powers. So, this movie isn't canon to the show, at all. While the movie did get the big budget treatment, the CGI were awful. Even for 1990s standards. I like the new zoids, but the machines were so fake looking with the bad CGI. While the Zoids battles were just bad, the martial arts fight sequences in the film were pretty entertaining. I love each one of them. The fights, while a bit cartoony, and unrealistic with the wire works; did have some really good stunt work, cool flipping and funny one-liners puns. The best fight had to be them against the rock monsters. The fight choreography in the show is much more impressive that in this big budget movie. Granted, the show had some cheese, but nowhere near to the extent they used here. The supporting cast were hit and misses, too. I love how Ivan Ooze look and feel. What a memorable villain. Paul Freeman was great in this film. Still, hate that the original TV show villains were made into not-threaten jokes by this film. I hate the men in the bird like suits henchmen. Looks like something dated like from 1939's Wizard of Oz. While, a very short cameo, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick indeed was very sexy Amazonian type character. One character, I can care less is Fred Kelman (Jamie Croft) who was plainly added for Kid Appeal. Fred was treated as someone who had always been part of the cast, despite never being in the show. He had a very annoying sub-plot of trying to rescue the brain wash adults from Ivan Ooze control. I really felt, every scene with him, could had been cut. It's nice to see Bulk (Paul Schrier) & Skull (Jason Narvy) from the TV show again, play the comedy relief, but they weren't really needed. The movie pacing is awful bad. The movie really did try to catch the attention of X-Sports demographics with lots of pointless sequences of skydiving and inline skates stunts. Honestly, these sequence really slow down the movie. Without spoiling it, the ending is a pretty bad cop out. For those who possess the Great Power, all things are possible. Such BS! The soundtrack was so-so. Shampoo- We're in Trouble was simple just annoying one-repeatable lyrics, but catchy as hell. The main theme was alright for the most part. It did had some epic tones in it. Overall: This movie is so laughable now, but back then, it was a good time to be young. So it's hard to hate the kid movie too much. Great watch if you want a nostalgia trip.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
5,zkonedog,"Doesn't Understand The Meaning Of ""Camp""",3,12 April 2017,"The last time I saw the first ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" movie was as a 10-year old in the theater in 1995. I remembered it being rather disappointing, and upon a recent re-watch (inspired by the new PR film in theaters) it had much the same effect. Unfortunately, the producers of the film don't understand that the appeal of ""Power Rangers"" lies in camp humor, not witty wisecracks.For a basic plot summary, this film introduces new super-villain Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman) whose goal (as usual for this show) is to take over the world. The first part of the plan? Trash the Rangers Command Center and leave Zordon (Nicholas Bell) close to death. This forces Rangers Tommy (Jason David Frank), Rocky (Steve Cardenas), Adam (Johnny Yong Bosch), Billy (David Yost), Kimberly, (Amy Jo Johnson), and Aisha (Karan Ashley) to search a nearby planet for a secret power force that can restore Zordon (and thus their powers) to full health in order to defeat Ooze.You know, the sad thing is that there is a kernel of something decent planted early in this film. The idea of Zordon being central to the ""rescue plot"" is intriguing, and I will admit it is kind of cool seeing a totally Americanized version of the Ranger outfits (no Super Sentai footage here).Alas, the biggest problem with the film is that the filmmakers don't seem to understand that ""camp humor"" is a big part of the Power Rangers draw. I think of it like the only 1960s Batman episodes: Batman and Robin play ridiculous situations totally straight...and that is much of the fun! As soon as the Dynamic Duo starting winking and nodding at the camera, the jig is up! That's exactly what happened in this film. Without the Super Sentai footage and structure that powered the first two seasons of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on television, the approach here was to insert wise-cracks and (dumb) humor whenever possible. The worst offender was the Ooze character. Even as a 10-year old I could easily see how stupid of a villain he was.Not helping matters is that, to be frank, Rocky, Adam, and Aisha cannot hold a candle to the Rangers they replaced (Jason, Zack, & Trini). I don't think there is much debate about this among fans of the show. Also, the whole ""ninja costume"" Ranger sequences fall very flat, while the Zords battling Ooze's ""monsters"" would have been better served by Super Sentai, I think, as they were so so poorly conceived.All in all, this was a poor effort pretty much all-around. Probably the only reason I can give it three stars is because I have so much nostalgia for the show that I won't let myself go lower! There are a few hints at what could have been a decent effort here (new villain, Zordon plot, etc.), but none of them are used correctly. Sadly, this movie pretty much torpedoed my fanaticism over Power Rangers during my childhood. I realize that the shelf life wouldn't have been much longer anyway (this stuff is made for kids, and kids grow up and find new things to do), but even sitting in that old theater (probably hyped up on sugar) dying to see the film, by the end I could tell that the bloom was off the rose.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
6,dee.reid,"Losing its ""Power""",4,22 June 2007,"I've got good news and bad news. Here, there is dual cause for celebration, and dread. The good news: In ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,"" the Saban-backed children's television commodity-turned-feature-length movie is pretty much everything fans of the awesome color-coded defenders of good could ever want. The bad news is, that's about it. This big-budget feature-length movie plays out pretty much like an extended version of the television show, and doesn't really offer much - to outsiders or the hardcore fans accustomed to the high-kicking action and special effects.As a fan of the Power Rangers from about 1994-1996 when I was between the ages 9 and 11 (the movie features the best and most popular cast from the television series, when Power Rangers were at their peak), I was one who eagerly waited in anticipation for a ""Power Rangers"" movie. I collected the toys, and I watched the show almost religiously on weekday afternoons on Fox Kids. Believe me when I finally saw the movie, I was blown away.In 2007, I'm 21; I've grown up. But I've still found myself attached to a lot of stuff from my more youthful years; Power Rangers aren't one of them. Some of it's because I haven't watched the show since the cast from the '94-'96 season changed, and a recent viewing of ""Movie"" offers little to a former fan. Maybe it's because I, like my favorite high-kicking teenagers, grew up.As a youth, it's easy to fall in love with this stuff. You got cool-looking characters, really bad guys, lots of kung-fu action, crazy plots, cheesy dialogue, and explosions and stuff. If you're an adolescent into things that go BOOM!, you're in the right place. I was one such adolescent with a big imagination and wished he had awesome morphing powers like his heroes. Some parents even got angry because they believed ""Rangers"" taught kids to fight out their problems rather than talking them out. Please.If you were into the show, you remember that six teenagers of the fictional city Angel Grove, California, were chosen by the being Zordon to become the hyper-charged Power Rangers, ninja-like warriors sworn to defeat evil everywhere it reared its ugly head, with awesome powers and their Zords - gigantic machines that represented prehistoric animals that could be used to fight their enemies in kaiju-style showdowns. Aisha (Karan Ashley) became the (second) Yellow Ranger, Adam (Johnny Yong Bosch) became the (second) Black Ranger, Rocky (Steve Cardenas) became the (second) Red Ranger, Tommy (Jason David Frank) became the White Ranger, Kimberly (Amy Jo Johnson) became the Pink Ranger, and Billy (David Yost) became the Blue Ranger; Billy was always my favorite. Together, they defined teamwork and were perfectly suited to fight off the extraterrestrial and domestic evils that threatened mankind.In ""Movie,"" Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman, chewing up all his scenery) is freed from a 6000-year imprisonment when Angel Grove construction workers accidentally stumble onto his lair. The nefarious Lord Zedd and his motor-mouth wife Rita Repulsa and their two minions Goldar and Mordant go to meet him and allow his revenge on Zordon. But he must first deal with the Rangers. After a few confrontations with Ooze's foot-soldiers, Ooze attacks their base, which leaves robot Alpha 5 short-circuiting and Zordon with only a few days to live. This renders the Rangers without their powers or their Zords, and they must journey to far-off Vados to receive new powers. With help from bikini-clad warrior chick Dulcea (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), you can pretty much bet your $8 that this trip will be worth it, again, if you're a fan.For those of us who are die-hards for ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,"" screenwriter Arne Olsen and director Bryan Spicer ensure that this is one adventure that won't disappoint. Except for a few minor changes, Spicer and Olsen stay remarkably faithful to all that we knew and love about the source material. This is also the first incarnation of ""Rangers"" to feature completely original material, instead of stock footage borrowed from Japan's ""Super Sentai,"" the show that inspired ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."" The choosing of the show's original stars instead of new actors was also a plus.Problems abound in ""Movie,"" the simple fact that it seems like an extended of version of the show. A rundown: an evil appears, and the Rangers come together to fight it. The movie pretty much follows the same formula, except it's 101 minutes of your life that you'll either love or want back desperately. Original ""Rangers"" show was never much for performances (so it's a moot point here to even mention it), and the dialogue never really goes beyond typical Ranger-speak (""Let's do it, guys!"" or ""You ooze, you lose!"").The one having the most fun, however, is Freeman. Unrecognizable under some heavy-duty prosthetics, he relishes playing the bad guy ten-fold in the best (and somewhat hokey) performance. Comic bullies Bulk (Paul Schrier) and Skull (Jason Narvy) are remarkably underused, and youth Fred's (Jamie Croft) is also underused. Most telltale about how much we've grown up, are the film's CGI special effects, which were brilliant for 1995 but have obviously dated and are yet another reminder that this is a film showing its age from a time when television was so much simpler.I guess ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" found its audience 12 years ago but will definitely have a hard time finding new viewers. I personally loved the cast and the show, but have a hard time looking at the movie now. Regardless of my misgivings now, 10 years ago this was it and probably about as good as it was going to get for the Power Rangers. Unfortunately, this is all we have left of the glory days when the Power Rangers ruled the world. When they lost their powers in the movie, some people today might wonder why they didn't lose their powers permanently.4/10",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
7,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""Just throw it in their faces!!!""",8,8 March 2017,"I never got to see this at the cinema back when it came out but I wish I had because at that point I was a pretty big fan of the show, and when I did see it I thought it was the coolest movie ever and it was a total masterpiece to my young adoring eyes, I watched it several times a day for about a month when I got the VHS tape for my birthday and drove everyone crazy! Time makes fools of us all though and over time I liked it less and less..but now I've come around and love it again, but in a much different way. I find it to be the very definition of camp, guilty pleasure, and so-bad-it's-good all in one package, and I see now that it's definitely not what you would call a ""good"" movie in any conventional sense even if it was made for kids. It's very poorly written and badly acted, and is a terrible and stupid movie, I know, but I don't care and I like it anyway! It has a special kind of place in my heart and I could never genuinely hate it. To me all of the faults just fit into the overall fun campy aesthetic of everything. It's a very silly and light movie but it feels like it knows how goofy it is and sort of revels in its own cheesiness at times and it never feels like it's taking itself all that seriously. Everyone's so peppy and upbeat, with the majority of the Rangers' dialogue consisting of rapidly-uttered bad puns and jokes while they're fighting opponents, but I enjoy that about it too, because that was pretty much how the characters acted in the series except that they also felt like more well-rounded real characters. It's cool how it stayed true to the show's core audience that way and didn't differentiate too much from its source material. But there are times when this picture fails to know the limits of its own strength and it falls flat on its butt when it's trying to go for an epic feel, case and point: Planet Phaedos. Everything on it feels cheap and artificial, with obviously fake mountains, backdrops, and just a noticeably fake atmosphere all around in a set that even the original Star Trek series would have passed on. The Rangers' first theatrical outing does up the ante, but barely. And get a load of what they did with the villain! Okay so I suppose that you could hardly expect a bad guy to be seriously dark and complex for a Power. Rangers movie, but surely they could have thought of something just a little more threatening than Ivan Ooze. He's a casually wisecracking and vaguely sinister old quirky wizard peddler man who's 'evil', and who's made out of ooze! Ivan looks more silly than scary and his big evil scheme to take over the world is ridiculous as well, for his grand plan is to give away magical ooze to kids and convince them to throw it at their parents, which will change them into mindless zombies that he commands to excavate the two powerful giant insectoid robots that are basically his evil versions of Zords. He's so lame but I love Ivan, unlike our beloved Rangers as far as this movie goes, he at least had a personality! Paul Freeman brought a joyfully wicked delight and energy and he clearly knew what target audience the movie he was playing a villain in was meant to target and he made his crazy role fun and memorable and he stole the show. His design reminds me a little bit if Freddy Krueger and he plays it like one of the villains from the 60s Batman TV show, and is really not menacing at all because it's impossible to take him seriously even when he's wrecking Zordon's lair, but he's so entertaining to watch that to me he makes the flick worth watching singlehandedly. He doesn't have all that much to do in the story after dispatching Zordon except for hanging out with Goldar and the pathetic pig character until he becomes enraged after the Rangers manage to destroy one of his Ecto-Morphicons, which monstrous cgi or no, were much cooler looking than the crappy new animal Zords, and he combines himself with the surviving one to become a gigantic Ivan-Morphicon thing right at the end! The rather awesome Lord Zedd and space harpy witch Rita are made to look like even bigger buffoons than usual and are zapped and miniaturised into a snow globe by Ivan where they sit out the rest of the movie, instead of having their power made use of by, oh I don't know, being sent after the powerless Power Rangers to deal with them instead of the useless tengu warriors! And in the end, Ivan proves to be no more competent than they were.. In the final big climactic battle in outer space the Rangers don't use any special mystical Ninjetti skills that they learned on their 'epic' quest, no they just fight dirty and beat him with the old emergency space knee in the balls manoeuvre that sends him hurtling into the path of an incoming comet where he promptly goes kablooey! So while I may laugh at its foibles, I still love this movie, it's a lot of silly fun and it makes me feel nice and nostalgic. Thank you indeed for all the fun Power Rangers, it was quite a ride.

8,bkrauser-81-311064,Not the Nostalgia Trip You'd Hope For,1,9 May 2016,"Oh boo, hiss, yes I know! ""Don't mess with my childhood,"" I hear so many of you ape in unison like teenage fans at a rock concert. When was the last time you actually watched Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? When was the last time you actually tried to understand the group dynamics, the intricacies of the plot and the villain's head-scratching plot for world domination?The movie begins with a prolonged skydiving sequence (which granted was cool when you were six but looks silly now). After slapstick bulwarks Bulk (Paul Schrier) and Skull (Jason Narvy) land in a construction site, they discover an alien looking egg which alerts Power Rangers leader Zordon (Nicholas Bell). The Rangers are dispatched to recover the egg but perennial villain Repulsa (Julia Cortez) gets to it first and unleashes Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman), a powerful inter-dimensional wizard capable of usurping untold amounts of energy. He neutralizes the Rangers, forcing them to travel to a far-away planet to find more power I guess. Meanwhile Ivan dolls out his ooze to the masses gaining control of a hypnotized slave workforce to recover his Titan robots. The Rangers return in time for the ultimate battle, suiting up in snazzy new costumes and inexplicably appropriately themed mega-robots.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie upon repeated viewings feels like an overt cash grab, complete with brand-spanking-new animal themed robots meant to sell toys. Everything from the acting to the story is so flaccid, boring and phoned-in that it's borderline insulting watching it as an adult. And lest we forget, even if you forgive all it's faults, there's still the cheap special-effects. While as a young child such ineptitude was forgivable, today the Power Rangers' chintzy miniatures and vapid monster v robot setup conjures memories of Post- Mothra Godzilla (1954) movies.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
9,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie""- What was once thrilling as a child is just a little too cynical looking back as an adult...",3,24 March 2017,"I was born in the late 80's and grew up a total 90's kid. There were three facts I knew to be certain... the kids who owned both a Sega Genesis and a Super Nintendo were gods amongst men, Ren & Stimpy were the highest achievement in comedy humanity has ever witnessed, and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers were the world's greatest heroes. Seriously, I was obsessed. I had tapes upon tapes of recorded episodes, owned all the toys and merchandise my parents would allow me to get, went as the Green Ranger for two Halloweens in a row, had a holographic Red Ranger pocket-wallet... I was obsessed. So of course, the second a movie was announced, I was stoked beyond repair. Heck, I even talked my parents into ordering me the movie's making-of scrapbook from my elementary school's Scholastic Book-Club!In honor of Saban rebooting the franchise with the upcoming big- budget, big-screen 2017 film, I decided to nostalgically revisit the original 1995 movie that the series spawned after its first few years on-air. I haven't actually watched the film start-to-finish in darned-near close to twenty years. (I drifted from the series just a few years after the movie came out.) What would happen? Would I relive my childhood thrills? Would it be a nostalgic blast from the past? Or would it falter and fail to live up to those great memories of mine growing up? Would it just feel like a cynical cash-grab?Sadly, thought I know many a fan still enjoys the film, my feelings upon revisiting it do definitely fall back on the later feelings above. While it is a fairly competent aesthetic and tonal transition for the series from the small to the big-screen, the story presented feels wholly manufactured exclusively to bring in the big box-office and merchandising dollars without really pushing the series forward or even really making an effort to connect with it. (Heck, the movie isn't even feasibly canonical with the show given all the ret-cons and continuity errors!) And while it is far from a terrible film, this former Rangers fan feels sadly let-down looking back at a movie I once loved, now that I see it for what it is.The Power Rangers Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park, Billy Cranston, Aisha Campbell, Kimberly Hart, and Tommy Oliver are in for the fight of their lives when their foes Lord Zed and Rita Repulsa unearth and resurrect an ancient and vile villain known as Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman)- a ""morphological"" being with a wide-range of powers. When Ooze destroys the command center and gravely injures the Rangers' leader Zordon, the super-powered teens will be forced to travel to a faraway alien planet in search for a ""Great Power"" to save their master and find the inner strength to defeat this new threat!To give the film the credit it deserves, there are some definite positives to be had. The actors portraying the Rangers all do about as well as they do on the small screen, and they're all pretty likable. Freeman makes for an entertainingly over-the-top villain with some great riffs and gags that I'm assuming were his additions. (A hilarious joke where he lists the things he missed out on before being brought back by Zed and Rita in particular is uproarious.) And the film does a nice job updating the Rangers for the big- screen. The then- cutting-edge CGI, brighter and more detailed costuming work and grander scope are definitely appreciated. This is the best the original Rangers ever looked, and everything feels a lot bigger and more bombastic thanks to the higher budget.Unfortunately, the rest of the film falls very flat in my opinion, and comes off as little more than a mindless cash-grab. The script by Arne Olsen and John Kamps hits every note that you'd expect a cynical kids movie to hit. From the addition of a never-before-seen child ""sidekick"" who needs to assist the Rangers by helping them save the day (a common trope in children's entertainment, and always an unwelcome addition), to adding in plenty of new villains and heroes and robots and costumes to drive up toy-sales, to constant eye-rolling banter and catch- phrases that stink of 40-something writers trying to emulate their teenaged children... it's all so lazy and trite. Direction courtesy Bryan Spicer is barely passable, with his structuring of scenes feeling overly suspect and standard. And the film can barely even try to hide the fact that it's an expensive, 90-minute commercial. Each and every scene shows off new products to buy, blasts new music for kids to beg their parents to buy them, shows us the shiny new versions of last years toys that parents must now re-buy... it's kinda shameful, to be blunt.I keep seeing a recurring theme in the positive reviews claiming that this is all fine because it's ""just a kids movie""... no, sorry. We as adults need to demand more from the entertainment geared towards our children. It's completely not OK to just give them bad entertainment and justify it by saying it's ""just a kids movie."" There are plenty of good, high-quality kids films out there. Stop enabling what is nothing more than inherent laziness on the part of filmmakers trying to make a quick buck off of children.Look, I still love my memories of the Power Rangers. And I'll never regret my time spent with the franchise. Heck, I'm probably gonna see the new movie in theaters when it comes out. But we have to admit... it's not the perfect pop-culture relic that we pretend it to be, and some facets of the series- including this film- are little more than cheap merchandising tools.I give ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" a sub-par 3 out of 10.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

So I asked my dad to take me and he did he took me and my brother to go see it and it's one of the movies I can still recall the reaction and the emotion I felt in the theater and I saw it 20 years ago when I saw it in 1995 in theaters.The movie centers around the Power Rangers Tommy The White Ranger (Jason David Frank),Kimberly The Pink Ranger (Amy Jo Johnson), Billy The Blue Ranger (David Yost), Rocky The Red Ranger (Steve Cardenas) Adam The Black Ranger (Johnny Yong Bosch), Aisha The Yellow Ranger (Karan Ashley) as they battle against a foe that has been imprisoned by Zordon and now seeks revenge.Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman) has been in a egg for 6000 years and after he is freed by Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa he begins to attack the Power Rangers.After getting the movie on DVD and watch it again it did bring back the memories of my childhood but of course I look at it through an adult point of view and it has been interesting to say the least.But nevertheless the film is one of the few that ever made me cry in the theater, normally I could handle it but for this one it didn't happen I shed a tear or two in the film and it also made me laugh at the comedy of the film which are still funny as they were back then.Also the soundtrack and music for the film is pretty well balance with something for everyone from classic songs to a score that helps tell the story of the film and looking at it now it's quite the score that you can't help but respect because it help tells the story of the movie. The music just so well balance for a film targeted to kids. The stunt and actions scenes were where the film took off for kids as that's what we wanted for I remember in the theater everyone cheer when the Rangers morph. The story of the film worked for Power Rangers fans. The film is better for those who grew up with the series and for those who are fans of power rangers but some might like to check it out for those who just want to see what was the big thing back than. Nevertheless the film is just a piece of nostalgic. Seeing the movie on the big screen is one of the best times I had at the movies and still feels that way when I watch itMighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is actually an enjoyable film and it would be good for any fan of Power Rangers and the kids might enjoy it.I give Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie an 8 out of 10 It's Morphin Time!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
11,Angelus2,Opening fight scene makes this film simply great!,10,24 December 2009,"The Power Rangers arrive on the big screen...The plot is simple...5 teenagers are the protectors of Earth, by using their Kung-Fu skills on the evil monsters...Here they must unite to fight against the Ivan Ooze, who has been released from his prison, by the evil Rita and Lord Z...Only Ooze decides he wants to take over.....Now only the five Power Rangers stand in his way.Yes, the dialogue isn't the greatest...But you know what? From the perspective of the child that watched this movie years ago...It was was amazing! The monsters were all so scary and more importantly the opening fight scene between the Power Rangers and Ooze's men was simply amazing..Even as a child I felt that the whole 'Power searching' mission was a waste of time..The whole dinosaur bone monster scene was un-called for...The one thing made this show amazing was the re-designed suits...Armoured with great gadgets which we never saw again, in the series...",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
12,emasterslake,Back when I was a sucker on franchises like this.,7,7 December 2006,"I was obsess with the Power Rangers when it first came on back in the mid 90s. The show already hypnotized me, so I was looking forward in seeing this movie. I remember there were hardly any people in the movie theater when I saw it.It's much different from the TV series I knew from. Starts off with the discovery of an egg pod containing ooze that's been imprisoned on Earth for quite sometime. Lord Zed and his minions come to awaken the the egg pod which has this Ooze dude named Ivan Ooze who's going to create chaos and crush the Power Rangers with his very hands.Only to discover that this foe is much more challenging than he appears to be. And the Power rangers will need upgrades in order to defeat him.I've seen this movie so many times right until I lost interest in the series years later. Been years since i've last seen this film. But since I'm no longer a fan of it, I don't really consider it a cult classic. The die hard fans might enjoy it a lot. This is one of the examples of low budget movies that lure me, way before I knew the difference between a good and bad movie.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
13,Beta_Gallinger,Good thing it was meant for kids only!,3,14 July 2007,"The ""Power Rangers"" franchise began in the early 1990s, with the original TV series, ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"". Without a doubt, although it may have been highly criticised by those past their childhood, the show turned out to be a huge hit with kids. In addition to that, two years after the series began, young fans finally got to see the superheroes on the big screen, in 1995's ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"", which didn't seem to disappoint most of those fans.The evil and despised Ivan Ooze is finally released from captivity after six thousand years, so the Power Rangers have a new enemy! The superheroes soon find that their power is gone, and when they go to the command centre, they discover that Ivan has destroyed the place, and Zordon is dying! In order to defeat Ivan and rescue Zordon before it's too late, the Rangers must travel to a distant planet, the only place where they can retrieve their powers! Meanwhile, Ivan begins his attack on the city of Angel Grove! Being in the right age group at the time, I remember the heyday of the original Power Rangers series very well. I was a big fan for a while, but never saw this movie. Basically out of curiosity, I finally just watched it, years after losing all interest in the entire Power Rangers franchise. Early in the film, I found that it was so bad that it was sort of funny, with its cheesy lines and action sequences, so it looked like it would be mildly enjoyable, as an unintentional comedy. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay this way for long, it soon changes, and for the rest of the movie (which is most of it), it's both cheesy AND boring, that is, for those who have left their childhood behind. The Power Rangers franchise was made strictly for kids, and this full-length feature is no exception. I might even give this movie a lower rating than 3/10 if it wasn't for the fact that I probably would have LOVED it if I saw it when it was first released, and probably even three years later!Although it appears they're still making new Power Rangers shows of different names, the days of the original are now long over, and those who were kids in the 1990s and were fans are now much older. Some TV shows and movies that one enjoys while in their childhood could easily still be enjoyable for them when they grow up, but clearly, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" is not one of those. With the ridiculous name of the main villain (Ivan Ooze) and the ""ooze"" that comes out of him, as well as the childish lines (such as ""Go get 'em, booger man!""), the poor quality characters, and so many other things (most of which you would probably find in the show as well), I'm sure it's VERY hard for an adult to take this movie seriously. So, for adults, I don't recommend ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"", even if you're looking for a movie that's so bad it's unintentionally funny. However, looking at how many kids this movie has impressed, I guess it deserves SOME credit.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
14,vip_ebriega,One of the worst movies I have seen by far.,1,19 February 2007,"My Take: One scene of awe-inspiring ineptitude and stupidity after another. I haven't watched this movie since I was a kid. Back then, I was a real fan of the Rangers, maybe because back then, I was a Dinosaur fan (and Dinosaurs were some kind of symbol for the Rangers). But When I grew up, I began to realize how awful it really is. Well, you know, when you're a kid, you like anything flashed in to your screen. But now, I have watched a variety of movies, and know how to distinguish a bad one from a good one. And ""Power Rangers: The Movie"" is baaaaad!!! I mean the plot is lame, the acting atrocious, the special-effects are low-budget, the slapsticks are corny and the heroics, come on, are they really heroes? Still, it's kinda good for camp laughs sometimes, but don't even think that this is a popcorn movie, it'll spoil your appetite (for popcorn). If they actually tried to do what needs to be done, and done right, it would have been better, waaaaay better. You may rent it for the kids, maybe even watch it with them. But never watch it alone, it's no mature movie, everything is childish, no stupid.Well, this may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. Now, do yourself a favor and avoid it. Maybe watch a Looney Tunes head-banger and be amused.Rating: 0 out of 5.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
15,Mister-6,"Not so ""Mighty""...",1,30 March 2000,"The TV show is bad enough; a bunch of teenagers dress up in fluorescent primary and secondary colors to beat up a bunch of guys in old Toho monster movie costumes while talking about being good citizens, caring for the environment, whatever's politically correct.The really bad thing is someone thought it should be made into a movie.I don't know: does ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" appeal to anyone outside of its targeted demographic (i.e. - pre-teens who are too old for the Ninja Turtles but still like seeing people get beaten up faux-Shaolin style)?  Don't see how, since there is next to nothing worthwhile in this movie.  I heard that in an interview one of the actresses compared this to ""Star Wars"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"".  I call BLASPHEME!In fact, the ONLY good part of this debacle is Ivan Ooze himself, as performed by Paul Freeman.  He is the most aware, most expressive, most intelligent and, by far, gets the best lines.  For example, when beset by the MMPRs, he squeals, ""Ooh, where's my autograph book?!!""  Now right there is one entertaining moment more than you'll witness from any of the good guys.  If they had just made ""Ivan Ooze: The Movie"", that would have been something worth seeing.  However, teen violence as shown here is about on par with the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks.  At least there, the teens got theirs.One star, for Ivan Ooze, but for the rest of MMPR:TM - less ""Power"" to you.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

17,The_Movie_Cat,"""Go Go Power Rangers!""",3,10 January 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERSYeah... just go. What a terminally bad film this is. It starts off with a ropy, would-be Star Wars scrolling narration voiced by an uncredited female. This mystery lady sounds alternately drunk, not comprehending what she's saying, and like she's got a large cactus stuffed up her rectum. It doesn't get any better.The Power Rangers are the six blandest teenagers you'll ever meet, colour-coded so you can tell them apart. Here's an impossible task: find a single personality among them. For some curious reason, whenever the Power Rangers do, well... anything at all ... they have to describe it to everyone. ""Activating power beam!"" yelps the token black girl as her helmet light comes on. Their one-liners are even worse: ""Have a nice trip! See you next fall!"" one says as she yanks a villain off his feet. Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? The Rangers fly by what looks like a felt tip pen on the film  and that's one of the more expensive effects. The budget seems to be as cheap as the direction is flat  which is a lot. Okay, expense isn't the be all and end all of a movie, but one such as this demands it. There is nothing beyond the mindless zap-pow of the visuals to recommend it, meaning its sole purpose is flawed. Particularly risible is the ""we've really ran out of cash now"" CGI of the finale.This is the sort of film where feeble, not even remotely funny ""jokes"" are met with ""hearty"" laughter. It's like the years 1940-1994 never happened. The jarring exposition and lame ""would even a hyena raise a chuckle?"" humour do act as a refreshing change from the otherwise banal dialogue, however. There's not a single iota of originality in the whole thing. We get the death of a mentor scene, the quest, the resolution... all set to generic rock music. We also get the moral of the story, the strength of a person being within them, etc., etc. Paul Freeman tries to inject a little fun to proceedings as Ivan Ooze, though is let down by the witless script. That said, the words ""Oscar"" and ""Nomination"" were never heard around this movie.Other things that irritate me: why is it when someone's dangling hundreds of feet in the air, someone always tells them to ""hang on""? Like the person in question was considering letting go and falling to their death as an option before hearing such an adroit suggestion? In fact, this timely advice is said three times throughout the movie, showing how fundamentally lacking in ideas the dialogue editor was. Awful lines, clichés (""You play with fire and you're gonna get burnt""), the Rangers moving their arms every time they speak so you know which one's talking... the sort of kids that say only things like: ""Whoo! Awesome! Aw-right! Way cool! Give me five!"" and Ooze's final defeat by a knee in the crotch seems inappropriate for a family film.Having said all this, the movie is probably great fun for it's target audience of pre-schoolers, and someone my age shouldn't be watching it in the first place. But don't you remember a time when children's films were made with at least some care or love for their craft? The Jungle Book, E.T., Willy Wonka... all children's films that have some appeal for adults, meaning Turbo, the inevitable Power Rangers sequel, would not be desirable to the bored grown-up who had to sit through this one. Power Rangers The Movie is just one long, joyless advert for action figures.Post-Script: Seven years on, and maybe this review was a little like shooting fish in a barrel. Having been forced to sit through the vaguely better sequel (4/10) then I can only conclude that I was in a snarky mood when I wrote this and that the world of the Power Rangers is just not meant for me.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

19,swilliky,Cheesy Nostalgia,4,24 March 2017,"With cheesy costumes, cheap special effects, corny dialogue, amateur acting, and a simple plot, the Power Rangers took to the big screen with a mix of new cast members and some from the show. I don't recall much of the Power Ranger lore but I do remember highly enjoying this edition of the morphing teenagers and their strange villains. This story begins with the colorful gang jumping out of a plane leaving behind their bullies. The new leader Tommy (Jason David Frank) the White Ranger has a complicated history. From what I remember he was the Green Ranger for a bit and a bad guy, then he was good, and then he became the White Ranger. I recall this story arc capturing my imagination as a kid.Kimberly (Amy Jo Johnson) was the Pink Ranger and had some romantic relations with whoever the leader was, at this point it is the White Ranger but I think there was something going on with the Red Ranger at some point but that might have been different than Rocky (Steve Cardenas). Billy (David Yost) is a returning member as the dorky Blue Ranger. Rounding out the team are the Aisha (Karan Ashley) the Yellow Ranger and Adam (Johnny Yong Bosch). They each have an animal power: the Red Tyrannosaurus Rex, Yellow Sabertooth Tiger, Black Mastodon, Pink Pterodactyl, Blue Triceratops, and the White Tiger. These are especially confusing as they get new animals when they travel to a far off land like Black Frogs, Yellow Bear, White Falcon, Pink Crane, the Blue Wolf, and Red Ape.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
20,Min111,This made no sense at all,3,11 November 2017,"I didn't understand why a movie was necessary considering the success of the show. The show was great, but this movie was awful. Made no sense. The plot wasn't remotely interesting. Personally, not a fan of the white ranger. I use to own the sword when I was a child. I like the black, blue, pink, red and yellow rangers. I don't like the monster - Ivan Ooze. Thought it was a bad choice. They could've come up with a better monster. Let's not forget about Bulk and Skull who happen to be funny. I like them two. Imagine the show without them. It would be boring. It's still better than that Turbo movie, but there's really not much difference to separate the two. One thing I did like about this movie was the fact you could see Zordon in his actual state - that scene was emotional. I also liked the scene at the start where the rangers were skydiving, and rolling in their skates, but it seemed like the movie got worse and worse since that moment. If you are a Power Ranger fan, you should see this movie otherwise it's really not worth the time. Once is enough if you ask me - fan or not. The movie is like one long episode. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers didn't need a movie. All these episodes was more than enough. There's plenty of action.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

22,jhaggardjr,Major guilty pleasure,7,29 May 2000,"I hate to admit this, but ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" is one of my major guilty pleasures. I really shouldn't like this movie since it's aimed squarely at kids. But to my astonishment I did. It's no classic to be sure. It's mostly ridiculous. It's absurd in many ways. However for some odd reason, it entertained me. The thing I liked best about the movie is the six young actors who play the Power Rangers. They're all good, although I wish the screenplay would have let their characters delelop better that it did. Then this movie would have been better. I wish this movie, as well as the TV show, could have been aimed at teenagers instead of kids. Then some of it wouldn't be so juvenile. However, this movie is nowhere near as childish as the terrible second movie ""Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie"".  One good thing about ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" is that you don't see much of two of the most brainless characters in the history of show business, Bulk and Skull. Cut those guys out! The six actors who play the rangers (Karan Ashley, Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Cardenas, Jason David Frank, Amy Jo Johnson, and David Yost) give far better performances compared to the two actors who play those goofballs (Jason Narvy and Paul Schrier) in this movie and on the TV show. Of all of these actors, only Johnson has gone on to some fame (on TV's ""Felicity""). ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" has better special effects than on the show and in ""Turbo"", and that helps alot. This is one odd picture. It ain't all that good, but it's not all that bad either. **1/2 (out of four)",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
23,TheHonestCritic,"This is, without a doubt, one of the cheesiest movies ever made. But, does that make it good or bad?",8,23 August 2020,"""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" (1995), I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch the different ""Power Rangers"" television series, created by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy. So far, there have been 20 different incarnations of ""Power Rangers"" TV shows. My top favorite ones are a tie between ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" (1993-1996) and ""Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue"" (2000). When I first heard there was a ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" movie, I got excited. Now, of course I didn't see it in a theater, I was three years old at the time of it's release! I first watched it on VHS and I loved it right away. It's just as good as the original TV series, if not better in some aspects. This movie has a great story, great acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The only real flaw in this movie is the special effects. For the most part, they are good. But, a few of them are bad and have not aged well, particularly the CGI animation for the Megazords and the robot villains. To be perfectly honest, the Megazords in the original series look more realistic, and those actually look like toys! How ironic, the toy-like Megazords and robots look more realistic than the CGI for this film. Plus, the effects for the exterior shots in outer space look a little bit cheesy. Other than those particular special effects, the rest of them are actually very well done because of the higher budget for this movie compared to the original TV show. Now, let's get into the positives for this film. The story is a lot of fun from beginning to end. It is cheesy and a bit corny at times, but then again, so are the TV shows! This film gives fans of the TV series, including me, everything that they expect to see, and then some. Also, there are several one-liners uttered throughout the movie. Usually, one-liners can make or break a movie or TV show. However, in the case of this film, they are all clever, funny and they do not slow down the plot whatsoever. Overall, the storyline is a lot of fun and if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, anyone can enjoy it. As far as the acting goes, it's fantastic from all of the actors and actresses. They fire on all cylinders. It also helps that the majority of the actors and actresses from the original show were cast in the movie. They all retain their chemistry with their respectable characters and really help bring the film to life. There are a couple of new actors introduced. The yellow and black rangers are played by different actors than the show. They do not hurt the movie in any way, and both of them play those characters flawlessly. Aside from all of the actors and actresses playing the Power Rangers, the biggest standout performance is from Paul Freeman as the main villain, Ivan Ooze. He really makes this movie! His performance is just as funny as it is sinister. That's definitely a rare combination to pull off in a villainous character. All of the sets/locations are nice, it looks like the actual TV series has been transported onto the big screen. Which really gives the film a great atmosphere! Finally, the soundtrack is excellent. Overall, this movie is a lot of fun and is definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of ""Power Rangers"". Even to this day, I still watch this film once in a while and enjoy it every single time. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 stars. If you're a fan of cheesy or corny films, then this is the movie for you! I honestly don't see anyone watching it, and not at the least bit enjoying it for what it is. Yes, it is bad, but it's so bad that it's good!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
24,Christopher_Reid,"A childhood favourite, still fun even if it's silly",7,4 May 2021,"Like about 20 movies in total, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie was for some period of time my favourite movie. I really liked the style, the colours, the energy, the basic concept, the action, the comedy, etc. Much of that still holds up today although it's very flimsy - not much is to be found in deeper meaning or originality.Ebert is right that the characters don't have much individual personality, but that hardly matters. Their teamwork and positive attitudes shine through. Even though it's cliched, at least it's a good message for kids. They do fun things like skydive and roller blade (something I've recently been learning in my mid-30s), all while being safe and wearing their assigned colours. I don't see why they need issues to be more interesting. Nor do I think they need majorly different roles to play. As it is, we at least get Tommy who is a leader and Kimberly who is more sentimental.The action is enjoyable, especially with some good music to go with it. It's harmless fun with many ridiculous physics-defying moves - a lot of flying kicks and spinning.Visually, the movie holds up well. The costumes are cool - all different and shiny, including the goodies and the baddies. The special effects are dated but the designs of the zords and robots are cool, all of them newly introduced in this movie.The music is surprisingly good and underused if anything. The action songs are decent, fit the choreography and don't disrupt the flow, but the orchestral score is even better.The plot is very thin and full of holes. Apparently the Rangers can casually teleport to other planets and Ivan Ooze's bird monsters can also fly through space with ease. And I didn't know that comets were fireballs which you could throw enemies at. At least the movie hits the right beats and we don't get buried in melodrama or exposition - the story just keeps moving and focuses on the action, comedy and excitement.Paul Freeman is clearly having fun as the main villain. He gets many funny lines including one he apparently ad-libbed - that he was disappointed to have missed The Brady Bunch Reunion (he likes being around for disasters). As an adult, his performance is the main highlight although the action and some of the comedy is also sincerely entertaining.I can see that the movie isn't quite as flawless as it felt when I was 10 years old, but it was good enough to engage me and still generate some laughs and smiles. It embraces its goofy, safe, feel-good action and does it well.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

As a result, I watched this movie a lot as a kid, and so even now it's packed full of nostalgia.Ivan Ooze was a pretty good villain too with clever dialogue. After all, Paul Freeman was the villain in the greatest adventure movie of all time, that of course being 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.The CGI is pretty rough, but again it's 1995 and Power Rangers, so just enjoy it for what it is.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

The suits for the Power Rangers are made out of armor and I hope they are like that for the reboot of the film series.I love the plot of the movie, too, and for them to go against Ivan Ooze was really cool and the ending climax of this movie was just fantastic and I watch the new POWER RANGERS show that is being shown on Nickelodeon and the new show is very amazing and fantastic.The music and visuals are really great for a movie like this, as well as they were in 1995 and the production design was really amazing in this film.Overall, I love MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE MOVIE and it is just simply a classic film. 8.9/10.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
29,maxmages,it's Morphin time!,7,26 April 2018,"So of course it's clear that this is not a good movie, not even the actors or the directors liked the movie. There are a lot of differences between the movie and the series yet the biggest one is this movie actually has a budget, has no stock footage from Japan and the whole toy models of robots are replaced by bad 90s CGI.The main theme of the film's score is a remix of the Power Rangers Orchestra's Go Go Power Rangers theme.
And it is awesome and unforgettable.
The suits are well designed. The dark tones work well with the light tones.
The fight scenes are good.
Exciting premise. The movie is fast moving.
Paul Freeman is doing well as Ivan Ooze and our main protagonists have good chemistry with each other.
The end is decent.I think I rarely saw a movie that stuck so hard in the 90's like this one, so it's pretty fun to enjoy it like a movie Schatz Zeit capsule. Unfortunately, once again, the filmmakers did not understand what the franchise is about and shot totally over target, I know the movie takes way too seriously and much too much on the actor performance of our main heroes on it. Expressing the face that we have overlooked half the movie has probably hurt to participate there. It's a pity, if any, especially science fiction movies try to be heavy and important, they always put the universe at risk, it depends on the balance of this and that, not every film has to go the same way as it was or Lord the rings it would be much better and would give the movie my much nicer meaning if the Power Rangers want to save Zondern because he is their dad figure and mentor figure and not because the universe and the bright side and the dark side of the power are affected by it.Villain Ivan Ooze is a terrible adversary, his power is inconsistent and stupid and his character design is just weird. And even for power rangers relationships. Sect are so awful that even the series makers would make fun of it because drama is so cheap that even Jean-Claude Van Damme could teach them something else and the storyline is too serious and seems to forget that they just a short fun time we should be a roller coaster.The series already had its questionable and ridiculous moments and has disregarded the laws of nature at 1 or 2 places. But this movie is not at all interested in physics and has logic holes and plot-hell.The story is badly written.
The spectacle is overly campy and humiliating.
Certain scenes go nowhere.
Embarrassing dialogue and humor.
Van Halen's music does not match the tone of the film, especially since this film was released in the extremely 1990s, while Van Halen's music is more suited to something from the eighties.
Tons of action holes in the San Andreas Fault size
the villains very little to the film.
Annoying sound effects are often heard when the Power Rangers move their hands or make flips.
Watching the villains die by squirting on a hard surface and turning into purple mud was utterly ridiculous.
Minor figures like a woman in rubber-metallic bikini, indicating that she knows everything.
Laughing Quotes + Puns
The special effects of the Zords and Megazords were done badly.
I'll always prefer practical effects but the computer effects in this movie were so outrageous that I actually prefer this CGI extension because it's so inferior in quality that I'll keep it in my memory forever and ever.But for all the bad things I can say about this movie, I honestly have to admit I love him I've looked at him several times and can not wait to see him again of course the movie is pretty rubbish but he's funnier garbage, funnier Garbage it is nice garbage.The film is simply stuck in the 90s and the song in the credits conjures up a smile on my face every timeI do it and can highly recommend this crazy spectacle to any trash movie fan; Go Go Power Rangers.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
30,T-ZER0,The Power is On,5,22 April 2021,"After season 2 of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Saban's studio decided to make a movie about six teenagers with attitude. How was it? Uh, well it's good and bad. It's not the best movie made but it has its moments.Firstly, if you have just come from watching season 2 of MMPR this movie looks amazing. Everything is filmed fresh. Meaning NO archive footage like in the original show (Let's face it in the show they re-use the same footage too much!)Angel Grove looks great as a large city, and that remix of the classic theme song is epic. I always liked how they remixed songs for a movie. If you were a kid seeing this in theaters, I can see how this was a treat. I'm a fan of the 90s, and this movie has some great 90s music. Especially when listening to the credits music here in my house I get some 90s vibes mixed with vibes you get when you are about to leave the theater after a first viewing at AMC.But now, let's be a little more serious. The costumes look pretty cool to me, I like the fact that their symbols are on their chests, and that they use armor now. But it's also bad, look at Kimberly's helmet. It looks like she has a big booty chin!I can't help but think this movie was partly designed to show how COOL people think Tommy is. When personally, I've always thought Tommy was overrated. I'm a Jason fan, and it's too bad Thuy Trang, Walter Jones and Austin St. John did not participate in this movie. When I say showing off how awesome Tommy looks I mean he rescues everyone, especially Kimberly. His team can't go 5 seconds without him. I kind of think it's really bad writing that the Megazords emergency button just lifts the leg so it can hit Ivan's zord in the jewels. Really? You had an ""EMERGENCY"" button and it just lifts the leg? Why not shoot out laser beams from the eyes? Or rockets from the chest? That button will only work if someone is in close proximity to you and that's a slim chance! Better hope you aren't hugging a friend and you accidentally hit that button.Paul Freeman plays Ivan Ooze, and for what's it's worth. I hope he got compensated well for playing a character to makes birds from his booger snot. (I'm not just saying that. He sneezed out a booger and it became his army!)Because it's with the newer Rangers, I'm not so attached to this movie as much. Because I like Jason, Kimberly, Zack, Billy and Trini together as a team, without Tommy overshadowing them. But this is for kids, so it has some merit.So to sum it up I will say this. If you are a Power Rangers fan, love Tommy, and like Robot battles. You'll love this movie. However, if you are looking for the best PR movie or media, you are looking in the wrong place. But it's worth at least one watch, maybe two.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
31,moviemattb,"Its no masterpiece, but its a good one",8,21 February 2015,"You all know how much I love the show, but now here is what I thought of this movie. ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" is very much non-canon to the show because of the suits, Zordon's look, Angel Grove being shot in Australia, etc. Heck, ""Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie"" is like the only one that is canon because it serves as a bridge between ""Power Rangers Zeo"" and ""Power Rangers Turbo."" Also, the production quality in both films are different. Lastly, there was an episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" where the Power Rangers get new Zords and becoming Ninja Rangers, and the name of the episode was called ""Ninja Quest"" as it was a retelling on what the movie did. With that said, the premise of the movie is the Rangers are participating a Charity Drive for the Angel Grove Observatory as they receive a call from Zordon, and warns them that Earth is in danger and that Ivan Ooze is about to return after being buried in an egg chamber 6,000 years ago. Unfortunately, Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa had already freed him and commanded him to destroy Zordon. The Rangers arrive too late as Ooze leaves them to fight his Oozelings, and entering the Command Center by destroying it as well as Zordon with him being outside of his time warp. The Rangers began to loose their power as Zordon is about to die soon, and Alpha sends them to a planet where they can get new powers. Ooze turns against Rita and Zedd and takes charge over the situation of the Rangers as he plans to brainwash the parents of Angel Grove as they dig up his Ecto-Morphicons to destroy not only Angel Grove, but taking over Earth. So its up to the Rangers to get new powers to save not only Zordon, but to save Angel Grove and Earth. I do remember watching this movie growing up as a kid, when it was on an old VHS copy that it really had ""Mighty Morphin"" on it as on later DVDs took it out. I hope this gets a Blu-Ray release for better picture (no DNR) and sound as well as a great amount of special features. Also, put ""Mighty Morphin"" back in. If I did a documentary for this movie, I would go into much detail about how the behind the scenes went as well as the issues. If Shout Factory did this besides me doing it, then it is all in good hands. Anyway, I thought this was a fun movie to watch. I do appreciate that the filmmakers were trying to make a high quality version of the show from being cheap, but now it looks dated which I will get to that in a second. I thought the cast did alright with their acting abilities, which I know everyone wants to poke fun of their acting. I know I can find some bad acting, but mostly I rather find is some good acting. So all in all, they did what they had to do. Paul Freeman who you may know him as Belloq from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" plays Ivan Ooze in the movie, and I thought he was good in it for being both evil and over the top at the same time. The makeup of him looks really good as well as the suits that the Rangers wore in the movie. The story itself was told fine, and I can tell that tone of the movie is trying too hard to be a dark movie but I give them credit for trying. Hopefully, the reboot can do something better with that as well as making it fun. I also do like Graeme Revell's score for making it suspenseful and exciting. I do enjoy the updated version of the ""Power Rangers"" theme song with ""Dreams"" by Van Halen and other songs that I enjoy. Bryan Spicer did a fine job directing the movie, but nothing more I can say about. I will say that the action in the movie is really darn good. Any flaws? Yes. I thought the movie has some good practical effects, but the CGI effects are downright terrible; they were probably good at the time, but now they don't anymore. I also would have love to see the original Red, Black, and Yellow Rangers in the movie if they had stay on the show instead of being replace. Also, I don't mind the movie being shot in Australia but could they get at least get the vehicles from America instead of fooling us with some Australia cars as if the wheels are on the left but not the right. There are some other flaws that I can point out, but that is all I got say. Nevertheless, the movie is both good and bad at the same time because all it is that it just wants to be a fun movie, and it really did; its no masterpiece but its a good one. I give ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" an 8 out of 10.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
32,Lando_Hass,The Power Rangers TV series basically went to hell after the movie...this movie was good though...,7,21 July 2002,"Back then when I was a kid,I thought that the Power Rangers were cool,but now I realize that all of the rangers are geeks...just plain geeks.The last time I watched this movie was when I was like 6,and I thought the movie was the best thing ever made,but I just watched it again to see what it was like,and it was just plain average.This movie does have some good pints,it has some pretty good fight scenes,good make-up effects,and just the fact that it was the classic Power Rangers,it wasnt Power Rangers Zeo,or Time Force,or whatever else they came up with,it was just the old good Power Rangers.there was some stuff I didnt like about the movie,for one,I didnt like the acting,it just didnt really seem convincing that all 6 kids were heros,but when your like 5 years old,you dont really care for stuff like acting.Another thing I didnt like was that the Power Rangers' suits didnt look all that great,but again,the suits look good if your 5.The new villains were pretty clever,but those ooze things dont have the vibe that the old puttys had.Overall,Power Rangers: The Movie is a great movie if your under 7,and its a good movie if your over 13.7 out of 10.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
33,byson5186,Wait Till The 2017 Movie,5,3 November 2015,"I've only seen this movie once. It was back in 1995, in the movie theaters. Man, that was 20-years ago. I have seen a couple of scenes from the movie since then, but I haven't seen the movie the whole way through. Though, I can still remember some of it from back then. It obviously wasn't a movie I cared to see again, because often times I think of the movies you really like are movies you'd want to see again. Some kids watch the same movie everyday Interestingly, as an adult another movie I left a review on which I remember renting 2-years ago and enjoying enough to watch it 3 nights in a row after renting it and immediately bought a copy and regularly go through scenes is a movie called Junior High Spy.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a childhood memory of mine. I went from being obsessed with Power Rangers to no longer caring about them. I stopped watching the show after the second season which was mostly when the show seemed to lose it's popularity. I mean I remember seeing so many kids dressed up in school as Power Rangers during the Halloween of 1994. But, the year after I only remember one kid dressed in a Power Rangers costume. I wasn't aware what was going on with the show during the 3rd Season. I think it's interesting how I went from being obsessed with that show to no longer really caring about them.I feel like the show went downhill during the second half of Season 2, around the time 3 rangers left. I think most of us preferred the original 3 over their replacements. I also started to realize as a kid that the show became predictable and even though Lord Zedd was supposed to be superior over Rita, more of his monsters were taken down more easily than Rita's. The show just stopped appealing to me as a kid, and I imagined coming up with my own plots.Many years later, I'd watch Zyuranger and buy the episodes on DVD. Man, I didn't know Power Rangers was from a Japanese TV show at the time. Watching Zyuranger I can't believe that I'm watching something older than the Power Rangers and what inspired it. I like a lot of you think Zyuranger is a better T.V. show and better done than Power Rangers. It wasn't common knowledge back then like it is now, that Power Rangers used it's footage from a Japanese T.V. show. Since Power Rangers was so popular back then, I wish Fox Kids would have taken time to show us more where the show came from, possibly even showing subtitled episodes of Zyuranger back then on Fox. Imagine how American kids from back then would have reacted if they could have seen episodes of Zyuranger and compare it to Power Rangers?I've mostly talked about my thoughts on the Power Rangers. But, let me explain the movie. Well, years later when I watch episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers I notice how this show wasn't entirely well done or well thought out. There seem to be plot holes and continuity errors. It was a little the same with this movie. I mean I noticed as a kid how this movie drifted from the series. We have the same characters play the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but there are numerous things different from this movie than in the series. It doesn't feel like it's canon. This movie also took place in Australia. I'm not sure why they had to go all the way there. Interestingly, some of the episodes that were made around the time this movie was made were also filmed in Australia.Here's what I remember about this movie. I'm sure we all remember the opening scene which was skydiving. I wonder if that was actually the actors who were skydiving, though probably not because they'd have to be like professional skydivers to skydive as well as they did in the movie. It also would have been hard to film it, as cameramen shoot from different angles? They could have had professionals skydivers, or they could have just used a green screen to make it look like the characters were skydiving.I remember enjoying this movie. If you watched Power Rangers back then, you'd probably think the movie was enjoyable. I liked Ivan Ooze as a villain. However, I also remember around the same time I saw this movie when I saw the Power Rangers on stage. That show seemed more canon to the series than this movie and was a fun experience back then. You can see it on YouTube now, and it seems like a lot of people preferred that over the movie.They're working on a movie that is expected to come out sometime in 2017. I'm sure we've all noticed how a lot of TV shows that we remember when we were kids that even had previous movies made for them, are having new movies made based on the original versions with 21st Century action and special effects. They've done that with Transformers and they're working on a second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie when a lot of us prefer the original 1990s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.I'm waiting for the next movie. I feel like almost any film can be good if they have the right director who can come up with an entertaining movie. I bet the next Power Rangers movie will be better, or at least make a lot more money than the previous Power Rangers movies including this one which had a theatrical release.Well, that's it and I give this movie a 5/10. It entertained me, but it could have been better.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

36,zurnderrick,Entertaining,9,8 January 2010,"Talk about a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the TV show it's based off of. It's delivers a whole new story, new characters we know nothing about, and new Power Rangers suits that make them look like pepped up NASCAR drivers. But, I will be quite honest. I love this movie! It is one of the best movies from my childhood.Even though the film delivers a lot of clichéd jokes and gags that will put everyone in the audience to sleep, it is still entertaining to see the Power Rangers kick ass. It is also interesting to see CGI animated zords for the first time, though I think the Ninja Megazord on the show looked better in my opinion.If you have time to kill, watch this movie. It's fun, entertaining, and will interest you. Surely it's not as good as other films like Star Wars, but is still a good film.

I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie.

39,Pilsung89,classic 90's cheesy nostalgia,10,6 October 2009,"As a child, I remember seeing this movie and thinking that it was the greatest thing ever. If I ever saw it on TV I just had to watch it, because it was the coolest. Now I'm grown up and realize how cheesy, typical, and silly it was. But I still love it, because it's a fond memory of my childhood. Also, I honestly think it much better than a lot of recent crap.This movie is exactly what kid's movie should be. It has clean action, clean dialogue, and clean humor. The layout and plot seem typical and stupid to many adults, but It's a kid's movie. One should not expect great acting or a great plot from a kid's movie. The truth is serious dramatic acting or a dramatic in-depth plot can confuse or traumatize a child. This movie is perfect for kids to see. It's not dramatic or real, and and the same time it's not a baby show. And for being low budget, the movie looks pretty good.Most modern shows and movies geared towards children are either simplified and redundant to the point of being baby movies, or have too much violence or swearing or sexual references.

41,marshall89,"A true stinker, but you were expecting L.A. Confidential?",2,11 January 2003,"Yes, this movie truly does suck. But observe my review summary folks. I'm not going to say I liked this movie, but it is a Power Rangers flick after all. It's supposed to be bad! I'm sure that when the writers were cooking this up they intentionally threw in average dialogue and bad fighting. After all, when the crowd you're trying to appeal to is a bunch of 5-year-old boys who run around in clunky Power Rangers costumes and wear PR underwear, you know you don't have to work too hard.I'll admit I never was a Power Rangers fan. I can still remember back in the mid-90's when the show was huge, and a lot of my friends were into it. But even at age 6 I never did view Power Rangers as a ray of hope from the heavens like most boys. I always thought their outfits were stupid and that the villains looked dumb. And at age 13 my opinion hasn't changed one bit (Gee, go figure.). But you see, the reason we ended up with this monstrosity is because we received it as a Christmas gift from one of my dad's students, and she comes from a family that doesn't have a lot of money, so forgive.Now, let's get down to the point. In some construction yard an egg containing the evil Ivan Ooze (Oh god...here we go) has been dug up and opened, releasing the evil piece of snot to terrorize the world, even though he couldn't pull off a robbery at a convenience store. Ooze goes to the Power Rangers' control center and destroys everything, leaving the place in ruins and stripping leader Zordon of his powers. The Power Rangers must go to some planet and learn some powers to save him and destroy Ooze. As if the plot isn't bad enough, the film only gets worse. The first sequence has the Poopy Rangers sky-diving while a pop version of Stevie Wonder plays in the background. The song is catchy, but come on: Why is music from a genuine musician like Stevie Wonder in such a lifeless film? Anyway, let's skip everything and go to where our ""heroes"" discover Ivan's egg, and then engage in an incredibly fake battle with Ooze's drones. Then comes the parking garage scene, where the Rangers constantly strike their stupid fighting pose and react to drops of water. Then they find the boogers and fight them while simultaneously delivering sucky catch phrases every 3 seconds, a tradition that is revived later on. I couldn't spot any cables or tracks, but you can still tell they're being used anyway. For instance, how do you explain the scene with the blue ranger falling but going into a pillar rather than touching the ground? Nuff said. They eventually squash all of the goobers, and let me state that the scenes of them getting squashed aren't the least bit violent. I don't need to explain the rest, for it only gets dumber somehow. And I'll let you in on a very surprising secret: I haven't even watched it all the way through. I would have seen everything, but my parents told me I didn't have to watch it to be nice. Even as a teen you've got to admit that mom and dad are always right, and they were definitely right on this stinker. On the only plus side, Paul Freeman does actually deliver a good performance as Ivan Ooze, and is given the only lines that are sort of funny. He also seemed to be the only one who cared amidst an entire crew whose only intentions were to release a 6-year-old junk flick.I'd say more, but I feel what I have stated is enough. One thing's for sure: I will never, ever forgive myself for watching this steaming pile of s***.I'm gonna go watch some Spanish soaps now.Overall rating: 1 out of 5.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

43,zurnd,Cult Classics: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,8,23 August 2013,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well.The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
44,the_headless_cross,"Without a doubt, a fun trip down memory lane.",10,12 November 2007,"Power Rangers were my life growing up. I refused to miss an episode, owned all the toys that came out, would act them out, even an awesome PR poster hanging in my room! And it gave me my first celebrity crush as well (Amy Jo Johnson, who still is looking fine at 37). I remember being at the movies with my friend and suddenly the trailer for the Power Rangers movie came up and my eyes widened to the size of dinner plates! I counted the months and the days down til this movie opened and when I saw it I was not disappointed! While a few things ticked me off (many weapons and gadgets created only for the movie and not on the show and the Pig guy, not a fan, oh and more Bulk and Skull please), I felt overwhelmed by watching my favorite TV show right up there on the big screen. I remember even dancing out the theater when Shampoo's Trouble played on the ending credits (most likely embarrassing to my dad).Flash forward. After the disaster that was Alien Rangers and the mehness of Zeo, I gave up on the show, too many cast changes and power changes as well. I did see Turbo when it came to video and was severely disappointed. And I did attempt to watch the newer shows and they just don't have the magic. But man have I wanted to get my hands on this movie again. Finally got around to it today ($5 at WalMart, good deal) and wow did I feel like I was 10 years old again! Things have kinda changed, now that I've noticed how crappy the special effects are, and how cheesy the lines are. But do I care? No. I was just happy to see these guys again, fighting and spitting out their one liners! My emotions were running wild! Laughing at Bulk and Skull and Ivan Ooze, almost crying at poor Zordon, and the major goosebumps at the climax! Now when is a special edition coming out and when is Saban releasing the best days on DVD?",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
45,jwtrox08706,Perfect if you came from the era of the original series and are feeling nostalgic,5,8 July 2007,"Okay, I'm being extremely generous by rating this at a 5. I think I owe it to the film even now because I couldn't get enough of this stuff when I was a kid (and now I'm going through some nostalgia, because I can with the Internet and very recent technology allowing me to do so). I remember going to see the movie with my friend and his family who lived down the street. I thought this was the mecca of all films. Now, recently I've seen it, and I realized how much I have grown. If you're looking for a film that is groundbreaking and something that will touch your heart...forget about this film. But it seems fitting to make a movie about the Power Rangers, considering how much of a fan base they had and still have. I just have one big burning questionWHY PAUL FREEMAN? How the hell did such an amazing actor who played a perfectly egotistical villain in Raiders (1981) who ended up having his head exploded after opening the Ark of the Covenant end up sitting through hours of having purple cosmetics added to his face and body so he could play the chief villain named Ivan Ooze in a Power Rangers movie. Paul Freeman must have been the big name that they scored for this movie (as if the six teens and Bulk and Skull weren't big enough names), because I can't see how he could possibly have been of sound mind when he decided to do this filmno offense intended. I will give him this, though, he did have a rather good performance...he was over the top...but of course that's how Ivan Ooze is. I wonder why they decided to begin the Power Rangers: Turbo series with another film? As if this film wasn't bad enough, they had to go and make a second Power Rangers film, when the series was starting to get tired (despite many changes happening all the time). I'm quite surprised that it's still going on today fifteen years after it first began. But this film has nostalgic sentimental value to almost anyone who went through their childhood in the early '90s, so it's not like Jaws 4 or a movie of the week.

This Story follows the journey of TV's favourite superheroes Tommy, Billy, Kimberley, Rocky, Aisha and Adam, as they fight their latest enemy Dr Ooze! but they unluckily lose their powers when Ooze destroys Zordons command centre and they need to find the Ninja Powers before he destroys the world, (leading back to the TV show storyline). They fight some baddies on the way and when they get new Powers, Zords, its back to Angel Grove, where they need to finish Ooze forever. The action is great, the effects are great and everything about this movie is great because of the great cast, although i did prefer Zack, Trini and Jason to Adam, Aisha and Rocky but O well! Amy Jo Johnson is as sexy as ever, David Yost (Billy) is always great and David Frank (Tommy) is always an OK character but overrated! this was my favourite movie as a kid and its also a little of a guilty pleasure when i watch it now! this is the best Spin Off to come out the Original Power Rangers EVER! and don't bother watching any other lame spin off, this is the one for you!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

The opening skydiving sequence with all six of the Power Rangers was very well made.The antagonist of the film, Ivan Ooze was alright. Other times, I shake my head in disbelief in that that could of done so much more with the Power Rangers license and made it better.The part where the Rangers lost their powers and became ninjas I just wasn't too fond of.I don't even know. I just wished the Power Rangers fought more than just generic baddies and putties in the film. You think Tommy could of had an epic showdown with Rita Repulsa or something. Speaking of which, it's worth noting Tommy and Kim are basically the only two Power Rangers that get any sort of screen time. The other four Rangers are just kinda there.It's completely mindless fun to watch but at the same time, that's why this is just a mediocre film (at best) and that no one other than kids past the age of 10 will find something to enjoy here.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

The uniforms were jazzed up, the zords were upgraded, the fights were bigger, the stakes higher, the plot bigger, the villain was badder, the emotions ran higher, hell, even the command center was even improved.

51,zordmaker,You're watching so much more than just a movie here!,10,26 April 2011,"The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it.To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like ""Tron"" (1982). Sort of ""How dare they"" and ""what were they on"" and even ""how much money can you throw at something to make it work""? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it.Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had ""passed through hell together"" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen.MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the ""golden age of Sydney film making"" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful ""Babe"") to 2002 (basically finishing up with ""Superman returns"".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski ""Matrix"" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious ""Dark City"", the indulgent ""Mission Impossible 2"", the Oscar winning ""Moulin Rouge"" and of course the final two ""Star Wars"" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened.Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the ""best ever"") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes.So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch ""down under"" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those ""Golden Years"" of Sydney film making.And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the ""Celebration Tonight"" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
52,elsterusa,"pretty bad, indeed",7,22 April 2004,"This is a horrid movie.  Completely dumb in every aspect that it delves in. An insult to movies, and art itself.  You know what I think they did wrong with this movie?  They didn't make it a comedy.  Certainly, there were scenes in the movie that were meant to be humorous, but they failed and there weren't enough attempts anyway. The way I see it, this movie is a joke.  I laugh at failed scene after failed scene filled with drama that would be excusable in a bad, colorless, fuzzy, and altogether terrible soap opera.  This has some of the most cheezy special effects I've ever seen.  The music is okay, but usually just plain stupid (not as bad is in Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie).  Suspense that, well, just plain bored me.  Everything is a joke. There is one thing in this movie that is not horrible.  That is Paul Freeman's performance as Ivan Ooze.  I believe he realizes that the movie he is in is terrible.  Instead of being dramatic, in every scene he strives to find some sort of punchline so that the audience will have a harder time dozing off.  I respect that.  Unfortunately, this movie was made about five teenagers who look like thirty year-olds and have nothing better to do than save the world and do pointless karate moves with some very fake sound effects.

Then, a lame supervillain from Indiana Jones takes over the bad guy racket and the rangers must get an even NEW power.

(This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech.Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power.

59,Comiccritic83,"Enjoyable, but a letdown for fans",6,21 December 2005,"12/21/2005** WARNING!! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!**... Still with me?Good.Well, I am not ashamed to admit that I was (and remain) a huge fan of the original ""Power Rangers"". When I learned they were doing a movie, I thought it'd be so cool to see. But when three of the original Rangers left (including my favorite - Jason, the Red Ranger), I admit I was hesitant. Then I saw the movie and remembered enjoying it. But the movie was, and remains, a disappointment.Here's the plot: after participating in a skydiving event to save the observatory that afternoon (... wha'?!?), with Ryan's Comet passing by Earth in two days, the Rangers go off rollerblading while a construction site unearths a purple egg buried deep in the ground under a spooky-looking lid (even if it seems, like, only ten feet deep when it's buried). When a worker tries to touch the egg and is electrocuted, the Rangers are summoned to the Command Center by their mentor, Zordon, and the robotic Alpha 5 and are warned that in the egg is Ivan Ooze, a dangerous, evil morphological being.Well, that night, the evil enemies of the Rangers (Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, Goldar and a new character Mordant) find Ivan's egg, knock out the guards watching it, open the egg and release Ivan Ooze. To repay Zedd for freeing him, Ivan agrees to take down Zordon and his legacy, including the Rangers. When the Rangers arrive (though I'm not sure why they arrive so many hours later that night to find the egg), they find it open and Ivan free. Ivan sends his Ooze monsters to fight the Rangers, who morph into their colorful costumes to stop them, and Ivan flees to the Command Center. The Rangers are successful defeating Ivan's Ooze henchmen, but lose their powers and have to run to the Command Center, just in time to find it destroyed and Zordon lying in the remains of his time warp chamber, dying.With the last power left in the controls, Alpha sends the Rangers to find the Great Power on planet Phaedos to get their powers back and again power the Command Center to restore Zordon's tube and save his life. Ivan goes to see Rita and Zedd after his rampage and traps Zedd and Rita in a snow globe, taking over as evil leader. He sends Tengu Warrior birds to stop the Rangers, but a female (and oddly scantily clad) warrior Dulcea comes to the Rangers' aid by driving them off and showing them the way to the Great Power. While Dulcea helps them get their new Ninjetti suits of animal spirits, Ivan brainwashes the parents of Angel Grove into helping rebuild his two evil Zords. Now, the Rangers must face threats on the way to the temple in order to go back, stop Ivan and save Zordon. Oh, come on - this is a kid's movie! Of course he lives! That's why it's called a HAPPY ending!Well, for the good parts we have the cool cameo of Dulcea (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), great sets, impressive metal-plated Power Ranger costumes (from designer Joseph Porro) and three of the original Rangers - my favorite female Ranger ever, Kimberly, the Pink Ranger (Amy Jo Johnson); Billy, the Blue Ranger (David Yost); and Tommy, the White Ranger (Jason David Frank). The music by Graeme Revell also works well, giving a rather magical - and surprisingly beautiful - score to the movie.For the bad, we have the new Rangers - Aisha, the Yellow Ranger, Aisha (Karen Ashley); Adam, the Black Ranger (Johnny Yong Bosch); and Rocky, the Red Ranger (Steven Cardenas). They're all right with their roles, but they can be annoying and are definitely not as interesting (or cool) as the original Yellow, Black and Red Rangers. We also have a weak plot, very fake-looking (and lame) computer generated Zords that make you wish for live-action Zords of guys in rubber suits, little character development, a tragic under-use of seeing the Rangers in their costumes and an awful villain, Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman).Freeman's over-the-top performance is too ridiculous to take him as a powerful threat seriously, despite having moments of cool powers and moments of being evil. He makes corny jokes, bosses around Goldar and Mordant for most of the movie and has two lame evil Zords, called - I kid you not - the Scorpitron and Hornitor (how did that name get approved?!?). He also gets one lousy and weak fight, where he molds with a Zord and fights the Ninja Falcon Megazord in space. And his defeat is awful - he easily overpowers the Rangers' Ninja Falcon Megazord, but is quickly defeated by a kick to the groin and knocked into - surprise! - Ryan's comet (which is oddly a meteor) and explodes. Ugh.I love the original ""Power Rangers"" and always will, but the movie itself disappoints as much as it entertains. Had they had a better script, the original three Rangers included, more character development and more of the Rangers in their costumes, it may have turned out better. But to this day, I will still pop my tape into the VCR and watch it. And every time it ends, I still smile after watching it.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

Shortly after the films release, the t.v. show had begun to feature its third mega-zord. The story arc that encircles this new mega-zord as well as their ninja powers are entirely different from the movie, making it stand on its own. Yet somehow, its much lesser sequel is the exact opposite with series. Then they portrayed the mega-zord in the cheapest c.g. I've ever seen in my life. Why not use a suit, like on the show?

61,Fredrik-Hamper,A dragged out episode of Power Rangers,2,10 March 2011,"First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise.It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it.Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here.This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam.Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals.The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end.The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see.As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring.20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
62,tlso1987,THE way to remember Power Rangers,7,21 February 2010,"Side by side, the old Power Rangers show and the movie that came in the middle of it are pretty different. While the movie was written like an extended episode of the TV show, it's saved by better production values and good editing.Here's an example as far as production value - the Command Center in the TV show, if you remember, was a black curtain with Christmas lights hung around to fill it up. Zordon was a 2-second video clip that was looped to look like he was talking. In the movie, the Command Center is a huge room of patterned metal walls and blinking computer panels. Zordon, in the movie, is an actual actor in makeup, green-screened so his head is floating in the air.And the editing - the main characters always perform these over-the-top, often wire assisted martial arts, but in the movie these moves are cut just long enough to be ridiculous, and accompanied by humorous sound effects.The main characters are as useless as ever, and really it's the villains like Paul Freeman who steal the show, but if you grew up on Power Rangers and are looking for a trip down memory lane, look to the movie for some kicks.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
63,erichedlund1,its not that bad,8,13 October 2013,I admit as a 14 year old and watching it its pretty good. Critics don't really understand that power rangers is a kids show and making a movie out of it is just making a kids movie. Its underrated for what people give it. I like it because of the strong action although it was only occasional because it didn't want a lot of violence. The action was good and the story was well paced. The soundtrack score is phenomenal and the acting was good. I understand why people wouldn't like it. For starters is the overall budget. The costumes for the villains looked stupid and the CGI zord fight was unconvincing. The slapstick was ridiculous along with the jokes.

I bought the DVD recently out of curiosity and was surprised I loved it still, why? This is a kids adventure film based on a TV show so it's obviously not meant to appeal to over 12's. Kid's films that are spin-offs of TV shows do have an unsurprising reputation for being absolutely rubbish with crap acting because in most cases it's true.This film actually ""feels like a film"" rather than a few episodes of it's TV show counterpart stuck together which is most spin-off films feel like (some of them actually are).The story is nothing special, but in some cases you need that if your head hurts from keeping up with episodes of 'Lost' for example, the acting is average at best and the dialogue is corny but there are some amusing lines (not to mention Bulk and Skull's utterly stupid but hilarious antics), the effects are what you'd expect from low-budget kids film at the time when CGI wasn't as advanced as it is today, I must give the costume designers a big hand here as they look rugged and ready for battle unlike the costumes in the TV show which are basically leotards and crash helmets with the Power Ranger motif on them.I would recommend this movie to any kid who watches Power Rangers as it is today (I watched a couple of episodes of one of their more recent incarnations the other day and after 14 years, although the characters are different and they're set in different places, it's still the same old sh*t (this whole ""Megazord"" thing has gone stale years ago and it's like the makers don't really give a damn anymore).If any kid enjoys todays incarnation of Power Rangers, then they should see this movie and they'll be worshipping it by comparison, or if you're an adult, it's better than most spin-off kids movies out there today so there might be some pleasant surprises in store if you watch it with an open mind.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
65,frank-mc-gowan-official,A mighty fine mighty morphin offering!,10,23 September 2006,"Although this film differs to the main story arc from the series as a stand alone, its still a great in the eyes of many! MMPR:TM hit the UK around the time the white ranger was introduced and even before we knew three rangers (Jason, Zach and Trini) had left the show. The story focuses on Ivan Ooze, an evil villain who wants to get revenge on Zordon for imprisoning him 6,000 years before. Zordon refers to ""a group of young warriors like yourselves (the power rangers)"", so we'd assume that the rangers of that day were responsible.Ivan is freed by Rita and Zedd, but overthrows them and begins an assault on earth immediately, disabling Zordon and his command centre, and destroying the rangers powers at the beginning of their first battle with his Ooze warriors.The rangers must travel to Phaedos to get new powers (similar to what happened when they travelled to the desert of depair for the same powers in the TV mini-series ""Ninja Quest""). While they are away, Zordon is dying and the earth is being overrun by Ivan. Just as they arrive from the planet with their new powers the rangers meet Ivan's giant mechanised warriors and must call their new zords into battle. Phwoar! Will the power rangers succeed? Of course they will, they always do! ;) Great performances from all including the new additions to the team Steve Cardenas, Johnny Young Bosch and Karan Ashley. Kim has a few great one liners, and Ivan is just evil! A must see for all ages... a great fantasy adventure even if you didn't care for the series itself.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway.As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matinée some days.)",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
68,Mr_Beale,Much Worse Things Have Happened,5,8 December 2002,"For a die-hard kiddie movie, Power Rangers: The Movie is pretty good. It's not annoyingly pacifistic like so many other kiddie movies. The movie's respectable sfx, decent action sequences, and quips from Ivan Ooze should keep adults being forced to watch the movie in an attempt to appease their toddlers from suffering too much. They probably will enjoy some of the scenes. Unfortunately, the fact that the storyline's pretty dumb and pretty much every bit of dialogue that doesn't involve Ivan Ooze is pretty awful keeps this movie from being a good film for the entire family like ""E. T."" or ""Homeward Bound."" So, if your kid wants to see it, don't fret. They'll enjoy themselves, and you will survive.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

This is a fairly decent big screen adaptation of the TV series. dont get me wrong but at the time Power Rangers was the Biggest thing in Childrens Entertainment. I went and saw this movie. i enjoyed it. nothing negative that i can say about it, i think its a Quirky film appealing to the tween market. This movie is better than the series when they get their Ninja Powers.  but that was about it. BTW the new series is looking like it is back in stride with the originals. It nice looking back on this film as what childhood meant to me. Turbo, isnt that nice of a movie by all means. out of the two Power Ranger Feature Films pick Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.

71,shanestgermain,A flashback to the past,5,27 July 2008,"The mighty Morphin Power Rangers was my favorite show as a little boy and when the movie came out i almost crapped my pants with joy. I remembered watching this movie and loving it as a little kid when i picked it up the other day at HMV for 6.00, and now when i look back on those days i wonder, what the hell was rubbed in my eyes and ears? This movie has some really cheesy puns and terrible dialog, the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and the CGI is some of the worst i have ever seen. I cannot believe that i never noticed how bad the CGI was in this movie. The movie was allot different from the television show but i never noticed how different it was because i guess when i was little i didn't listen to movies. Ivan Ooze says he can't believe he missed the Brady bunch reunion in his slumber even though he had been asleep for 6000 years and last i heard, the Brady bunch wasn't around 600 years ago so he shouldn't have even heard of the original show. The villains don't look intimidating at all and I'm pretty sure lord Zed's helmet was made out of cheap plastic. Yet, i kept having flashbacks from when i was a kid when i watched this and since i loved it so much as a younger one, i still enjoyed the movie and loved to suddenly remember parts before they happened. Now onto the DVD itself. The design on the case and disc is nice, but the picture isn't very good in the movie and there's not really much extras. There's a terrible trailer and a ""making of"" featurette that has nothing to dowith the making of the movie and has one of the stars compare this film to star wars and the wizard of oz. Also i remember someone saying the Zord and massive Ivan fight on the streets looks really real and its the first movie to have that. I laughed out loud because that fight looked terrible and there were earlier monster movies that looked more realistic. I can't really recommend it to anyone that didn't watch the show or movie as a child and wish to see it again. I give it 2 and 1/2 kitty cats out of 5 because although the dialog and effects are terrible, i still somewhat enjoyed it because of how much i loved it as a kid.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

I couldn't wait to see it and I wasn't disappointed. Based on the original (and best) Power Rangers and at the peak of there fame it couldn't have been better timed. This is a kids movie back when the special effects looked exactly like the toys that you and all your friends had.

At last check this movie rated only a 3 out of a 1-10 scale.I really don't see why this movie isn't rated lower! Power rangers, with all of it's television shows is nothing more than a commercial for second class plastic garbage to sell to unsuspecting children around the world.The television show has already been banned in two countries, New Zealand, and Malaysia, perhaps they see through all of this negative advertising.There are far better forms of entertainment for our children.

Critics everywhere completely trashed this film, and it's box office was completely underwhelming as well.Roger Ebert wisely called this one of the worst films he's ever seen.

I remembered how much Inoticed the difference between the show, how it was filmed and what emotions they may or may not have put in in. I really enjoyed watching that movie a long time ago. It was definitely made for the kids and that is what I think the film critics missed. I mean come on! Its not supposed to be some sort of Academy award-winning movie that sets the standards for all movies.

The effects were awesome, the acting great and it was just really cool to see Tommy and Adam fighting again to save the world. With such wit that would knock anyone of their feet, nothing was going to stop this movie However, this was when I was five.Little did I realise that what C R A P this actually was.My eight year old brother got it out again - and I thought it would be good to relive the old days, when you would come home from kinder and switch on the 4:00 ABC kids to watch them morph and kick some PUTTY a s s.I'm now seventeen, and I don't remember how I liked this movie. There were so many flaws in it that my 8 year old brother got bored from this movie.The acting was C R A P. The black guy didn't even say anything, the Rita bad lady's voice was dubbed, the effects were S H I T, even for back then, and the movie was filmed in Australia, with some Australian actors and even with the Sydney Harbour Bridge in perfect sight. What really annoyed me was that an actor got out of an obviously right hand drive car on the left side after driving it up his Australian drive way with gum trees in the back ground. and they TRIED to pretend it was in the USA!!!!Anyway, if your five and your blind enough to miss the constant, irritating flaws then you will LOVE this.However, for 95% of the rest of the population, you will cringe at the most minute of details that are persistently C R A P.When I was five and a serious fan: two thumbs up Now I'm seventeen: two juicy thumbs down!!!!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

I'm 17 now, and when the show first came on I was 7 years old. After reading through the thread I wanted to go back and watch some of the episodes for old times sake. So I went to a video store and found the movie for really cheap on DVD and I bought it. And you know what? I loved it. I felt like a little kid again watching it. It brought me back to a simpler time and it was fun to go back and watch.If you're an adult who was too old to watch the show when it was on of course you're gonna hate this movie. The acting is horrible and the special effects just reek. The one thing about it I'd say everyone could like is the Ivan Ooze character. He's pretty cool. But if you're like me and you lived this stuff when you were little you should be able to go back and watch this and just have fun. You don't care about the horrible CGI, you don't care about the bad acting, none of that matters.I really find it funny how some people here talk about this movie like it was made to be anything else than a movie for kids.

It should not be compared to anything else, and it should not be judged the same way great films are judged. Its an original idea, and its bold. Its a non Disney production, meaning its fresh new and exclusive to my generation. Sure there is better children's entertainment, but that doesn't mean that this example is 'bad'. All i know is that I have a ball watching it now, just as I did as a kid, and that all the little children I know, enjoy it just as much as I did, meaning it cant be all bad if its standing the test of time, and reaching out to kids 12 years after it was made. Its a good time, and a good source of escapism for the adults that are dragged into seeing it. I do recommend it. If you watch it, just to negate, reject and make fun of it you will not like it.

It's just sad how people will judge a movie based on power rangers because power rangers aren't cool anymore. Most of these people believe it isn't because society tells them, ""hey you kid, you're what, 10? Yeah... well, f.y.i. you;re a loser for liking power rangers still, move onto anime."" What else is sad... is how critical people are. It's a KID'S movie. Yeah, sure, ""Finding Nemo"" was funny for everyone but, Power Rangers was never meant for adults. Simply, children. If it was for adults I'd say hell yeah, a 2 is out of remorse, but since i remember the good old days.

It didn't disappoint one bit. I thought it had some of the best fights and best zords in the Power Rangers series. I would watch this over and over Years later, I still watch whenever it is on. So nostalgic and fun to watch. I just look back at it realize things I never realized. Like how The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Van Halen were part of the soundtrack, and how far we have gotten in computer graphics technology.

As the rumor mill told, Austin St. John wanted too much money, as he was still the leader, not taking back seat to 'Tommy.' Though when having some time to think about it (or as some would say, too long without a job), he came back as the Gold Ranger (though another group says he knew he'd now be in the spotlight, so that's why he returned).Johnny Yong Bosch & Amy Jo Johnson are the only one to have much success outside the series. Johnson with Felicity and ""Susie Q"" (and probably another movie or two) and Bosch is the voice of Vash The Stampede in ""Trigun"" and also had a few voices in Cardcaptor Sakura, Witch Hunter Robin, and a few other series. Also, Tommy's not been lost as he returns as the Black Ranger and new mentor for Power Ranger Dino Thunder.

The characters are the main force of this film, showing teamwork, loyalty, courage, discipline, a true love, a sense of duty, a sense of humor, and respect.  It can be used to encourage values, to teach when to fight, standing up for  what is right, doing good, and love without sex.

Even if these elements had nothing to do with the original show, they did raise the appeal of the movie to the general public.

Personally, looking at this film now, I feel that the script needed improvement and because of this, the casts performances weren't as good as they could have been- I wasn't a fan of the new rangers i.e. Rocky, Adam and Aisha to begin with.The one major complaint I have in regards to this film is the new zord they have. What was the art department thinking when they designed that?! It's gruesome.I think that (overall), this film delivered what was expected of it, and that was- a fun film.

96,jordan_perryuk,Globalization commenting on globalization?,4,15 May 2004,"One thing I've noticed when watching this movie again (caught it languishing on the sleepy annals of daytime TV) is that there is an overriding theme of anti-globalization. The whole mass manufacturing of the 'ooze' to brainwash the parents of Angelgrove, seems to be like some grotesque fast food enterprise. Is this the intelligent, political message we've all been trying to find in the movie? Well, hardly, as the whole Power Rangers franchise, in its day, was one of the most wealthiest and popular businesses, and it dominated the television and toy industries. I remember I was seven years of age when the movie was released. However loathsome you may think of it now, when the movie was launched, prepubescents everywhere were celebrating. It was what the countless hordes of kiddies were waiting for. The irony is, is that I was among those ranks of enthusiasts, who believed that the Power Rangers vehicle was deified or something. But the real irony is that we were all brainwashed, as if we had guzzled our own healthy dosage of ooze. Oh, how naïve.The script, is of course, utterly abysmal. The movie's entire dialogue seems to be a disgusting volley of clichès. Their purpose was probably to add a touch of humour, but their delivery were so unforgivably corny they were all swallowed by the audience (apart from those too young to know) like lead bullets. They are so dull I can't remember any. There is some unintentional laughs: when Tommy stops the monorail from plummeting from the tracks 'just in time'. Everyone knows that they'll be practically teetering on the edge before they are dramatically saved. I remember I used to vehemently abhor Bulk and Skull, but now I actually feel sorry for them. They are a duet of desperate low-lives who just seem to get in the way, but we sort of sympathise with them, because they are just so inordinately hopeless. It is true there is nothing beyond the hammy kung-pow karate theme, but the people who saw it in 1995 (exempting the submitting mothers who promised to send their kids to the cinema as long as they'd just shut up) weren't expecting a Sartre-style treatise on existentialism, but to consume more vacuous action from the Power Rangers. Naturally, its more of the same: its basically an episode agonisingly stretched to feature-length. To my juvenile anger, Lord Zed played a very small role in the movie's plot. Instead you have eccentric despot Ivan Ooze who had been 'woken' (as most movie horrors are resurrected) who does have a sort of shine about him, but he's still terribly drab in parts. You can imagine the parents raising a smile to a couple of his sardonic comments.To be fair, the acting isn't totally irritating. The Power Rangers were marginally better than they were on the small screen, but for anyone watching the movie today, there is little to get excited about. They are predictable and so therefore of little interest. What I still find interesting today is the costumes, such as the dinosaur fighter statues that emerge from the rocks. They look like overgrown Henson puppets. And Ooze's cloak looks like its made from purple tin foil.The effects were advanced for their day, I'll give them that. The whole plot is like one behemoth of a computer game, so without special effects, the movie would have been further flawed. But once again, they have painfully dated, and the scene where Ivan Ooze extends and morphs into one of his giant metal insects is hysterical.Still, its the classic schmultzy 'and they all lived happily ever after' movie, and as long as you ignore the lukewarm script and just prepare yourself for a film that doesn't delve beneath the surface, you'll find it's an alright movie to watch, maybe once, with the children or the family. Its no Citizen Kane, but then what in today's film industry really is?And no one can deny that the Power Rangers were something almost everybody raved over in the early nineties: they were at their popularity zenith when this film was released in 1995. It WAS a big part of many children's lives, who wished something exciting as this would happen in real life. And lets face it, for many children the watchful eye of the Power Rangers would be something comforting, a protection against the bleakness of the world. Shame it's just so awful today.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
97,coreyl145,"Fantastic,Perfect for fans of the TV Series!",7,30 August 2016,"Power Rangers:The Movie is one of my new guilty pleasures. Now I'm gonna admit,I was born in 1999,after the big craze of The Mighty Morphers died out somewhat and have only recently started watching the entire series,only prior experience i had was with time force,wild force,ninja storm and Dino thunder. I Watched this film after finishing season 2 of the mighty morphin power rangers,which i consider excellent and had somewhat high hopes for this film. For a fan of the series,mainly the zordon era,this is a great movie to watch,and i feel it does the series justice,even it is now not canon to said series. The Plot of the film follows the rangers of the second season of Mighty Mrphin (Rocky,Adam,Billy,Aisha,Kimberly and Tommy) battling the villain Ivan Ooze,who has been released from an egg Zordon imprisoned him in six thousand years before the events of the movie. Ivan Damages the command center and incapacitating Zordon. the rangers are sent to the planet Phaedoes to become powerful enough to stop Ivan and help Zordon,and ultimately save the world. The action scenes were awesome in that special Power Ranger/Super Sentai kind of way,especially the Scene with the new Zords and when the rangers are skydiving,and the story was fun and easy to get into and immerse yourself with a great new villain. This film is a perfect side-watch to fans who have seen the Mighty Morphin Series,although if you aren't a fan of Power Rangers,you will more then likely find no enjoyment from this film other then the fantastic action scenes.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
98,abelgezahegn,One of the Best Childhood Movies Ever... Should of got a higher rating (7.8/8.0),10,9 September 2013,"As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as ""Les Miserables"", ""Star Trek"" (2009), ""Harry Potter"", ""Life of Pi"", ""The King's Speech"", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth.My Rating: 8.0/10",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
99,rsboyce,Wow,10,15 August 2004,"GREATEST Movie Ever!!!!! CHANGED MY LIFE!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! When I was 29 years old, this film was released in my native language (German). The quality of acting was exquisite and the vision of the production crew was phenomenal. After this 140 minute masterpiece. I began my quest to become a Power Ranger. I quit my job and began training myself in all forms of martial arts for over 13 hours EACH day. I constructed my own zord out of macaroni, whicker, and vinyl siding. It was AMAZING! With it, I was able to find girls that would go out with me. NO ONE can escape the lure of MEGAZORD! I was also able to paint the entire uniform on my body and defeat the giant rats through a series of roundhouse kicks. So in short, the movie was spectacular, Sherman is NOT good looking and Knibb High Football rules!!!!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
100,kstanni87,It's good,6,22 May 2021,"For power rangers fan it's a must see movie. It is cliche for a 1990's era movie including the humor and the CGI used for the Ivan's Ooze's robots and the Ninja Megazord didn't quite age well with the reliance on the metal being reflective and shining. How ever. Paul Freeman did a great job in his role as a no non-sense villain.However some of the sound effect are terrible when the Rangers are fighting the slime monsters Oozemen (Ivan calls them ""My Kids"".",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie

102,other_guy16,Underrated: an excellent film a la Superman The Movie.,10,22 June 2016,"Starting right off the bat with skydiving and rollerblading, we're introduced to a group of friends that has essentially become a family and found joy in adventure with each other. Then, the sadistic, sarcastic, vengeful Ivan Ooze shows up and destroys their command center, nearly kills Zordon, and the rangers lose their powers.While there isn't a heavy amount of character introspection a la 'Stand By Me', this simple adventure story has emotional depth. When the rangers find Zordon nearly dead, Kimberly says, ""Zordon, you've always been like a father to us."" As we never see the ranger's parents, Zordon is the father figure that the ranger's love. As the ranger's journey across the universe to save him, Ivan Ooze uses mind control to turn the parents of Angel Grove into his slaves, constructing the machines of their own demise. After the parents complete their work, Ivan orders them to all commit suicide at the same time. The children of Angel Grove team up to save their parents. So we have parallel stories of kids trying to save their parents- one from murder, the rest from self-destruction. While not told in an adult way, it's adult material.Today, every franchise movie is over-stuffed with phony character development that is meant to set up the next movie. There is no more respect for the film currently being made because it's not trending. But in MMPR the Movie, when the kids band together pushing desperately and feebly against the mass of parents trying to walk off of a cliff, and the ranger's are losing the battle against Ivan Ooze even in their new megazord, we FEEL something for each of them. We don't need anyone to have a raging vengeful plan or a ridiculous emotional plot twist -- we just need everyone to make it in the end. And when everyone succeeds, the audience does too.The moment that sums up the feeling of the movie is the ending. When the city celebrates its rescue thanks to the Power Rangers, fireworks go up, we see Tommy and Kimberly hold each other for the first time, and then Van Halen's ""Dream"" carries us into the fireworks. Nothing beats that amazing feeling of family, teamwork and success through so much adversity. I love this movie much in the way the previous generation looks to Superman The Movie or Star Wars as that life-changing film experience. 10 out of 10 for me.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
103,Joek00l7,Changed my Life,10,23 June 2005,"OMG this movie was amazing. After seeing this movie i was inspired to get a job and have a family. I now fight puppets for a living in miniature city sets. Power rangers, if it wasn't for you I would still be on the streets eating rats and drinking out of a sewage pipe. I love power rangers. The way the black one kicks those bad guys butts was truly cinematic gold. The use of sparks instead of blood reaches out of the screen and knocks you in the face. Every battle leaves you awestruck and wanting more. Oh just talking about it makes me want to pop some over-sized man in a squid suit from space right into a mini building that immediately explodes into a burning fury of sparks and paper mache. Who i am 30 years old and can barley get out of bed every morning but somehow this movie rejuvenates me. My excitement before seeing it helps me overcome my lose of breath and my constant chest pains. Bravo MMPR, Bravo. My hat goes off to you for such a glorious display of action and mayhem. My mother saw this movie when she was dieing of cancer and it gave her the strength to go out side and douse herself in gasoline and light up a cigarette. I know it will change your life as much as it has changed mine.",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
104,Gaasu,MMPR : The Movie,10,2 July 2005,"I can remember back to when I was a child and was absolutely obsessed with Power Rangers. Then, I watched this movie. I was amazed. I was in awe. And to be honest, I'm still surprised that I'm enjoying this movie at the age of 14! He he.... But, anyway, this movie is fantastic. I would suggest it to anyone who is a fan of Power Rangers, young and old. As I watch Power Rangers: Space Patrol Delta, I'm almost depressed. I think back to the original actors: Amy Jo Johnson as Kimberly, Johnny Young Bosch as Adam, and who could forget Jason David Frank?! So I try to go back to watch this movie as much as possible (it's THAT good) just so I can reach back into my childhood. :D",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
105,gorillez,Power Rangers on DVD wow!!!,10,15 May 2005,"When I was 8 I used to rush home from school to watch the Power Rangers fight their new baddie of the week. I thought it was great! And then the movie came out and I was able to see them on the big screen. I've gotta tell you that it was fantastic! As an 8 year old I fell in love with Tommy (my first crush) and couldn't help but laugh at all of the jokes. 10 years later I found it sitting on a shop shelf, WHAT! POWER RANGERS ON DVD??? NO WAY! SO, as you do, I bought it and it was just as good as I remembered. Perhaps not for the same reasons though. Some of the jokes have worn off but as a now 18 year old I am understanding all of them now. I still find Tommy to be absolutely adorable and I have found this trip down memory lane to be quite an exciting adventure. I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the show as it is quite funny to see them talking with their fists all of the time no matter the context and the different fashion back then. How often do we see teenagers dressed with their shirts tucked into their jeans with a nice brown leather belt? Ha ha ha. I thought this movie was great for a laugh. POWER RANGERS ON DVD??? WOW!!!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
106,greenglowstick,This Movie is the Shiznit!!,10,15 May 2005,This film is not meant to be at all meaning full to an adult audience. I however saw this film as a child and loved it. I wish that children's films were still like this today instead of that animated junk. This film was terrific it has a pretty great story lovable characters and great villains. I fell bad that this terrific series has gone down the poop shoot with about 9 remakes of the characters. I think that a lot of people that were children when this came out would agree here. Not to mention the film had an amazing soundtrack. All in all for a children's film i think that this film was worth the money and i suggest this movie for the newer generation of children too!,Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
107,shinodahahn_vic,Those were the good old days...,10,29 July 2005,"I can't believe I'm making comment about this movie after 10 yrs it has been released. Gosh. Power Rangers were one of my favorite TV show when i was a kid. I remembered I was like rushing home after school just to catch this show. And gosh, Tommy is my all time favorite (although I don't deny Jason is cool too ;)) It's so weird that how the memories strike back yesterday. Of course it's 2005 now and there's so many cool super heroes movie. But I think for us kids last time, Power Rangers nailed it. Kids who were born-ed in the 80's or 90's, almost every of them knows and loves the 6 super heroes of Angel Groove. I didn't watch this movie in the cinema, I remembered how I used to collect all their tapes. Now i'm regret of throwing them away. Of course the new power rangers are like improved with new technologies. For me, tale as old as times. I love the original MMPR rather than the new ones we have. I might be 20 yrs old this year. But honestly,those good old days really makes me smile again. Knowing that Tommy aka Jason David Frank is one of the real good martial arts constructor, I'm proud to have him as my first ""kiddie prince charming"" when I was a kid. JDF rocks! ;)",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
108,nightdai,Oh come on!,9,1 September 2005,"I've been sorely disappointed to see this in the top 100 worst films of all time. Having watched this when Power Rangers was at its highest in the UK, and having been of the right age to have interest, I absolutely loved this! I remember watching it plenty of times, and all my friends at the time shared the same opinion that this film completely ruled! Getting to see all the notable and very memorable characters was great. Sorry to sound over-reminiscent but having Lord-Z and Reta working side-by-side was awesome! The scenes are corny and childish, the plot is simple, the characters are drones, the humour is pathetic and the graphics are bland. BUT THEY AREN'T IMPORTANT TO THE TARGET AUDIENCE. This film was breathtaking at the time me and my friends saw it, and it will forever be one of those films that I can remember having a great time watching. I urge people not to down-vote this because it doesn't tickle their mature tastes, and leave it to it's target audience, that unfortunately probably know nothing about how to vote on this website :) But to those who watched it at a young age (like myself), let's not say this film wasn't worth watching at least half a dozen times!",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
109,yashyamashita,this is my childhood,5,23 March 2017,this is my favorite movie out of all the power rangers movie released. this is the first movie that i owned (and in VHS back when i was a tiny child).i would watch this every single week and almost had the script memorized. i would wear my pink ranger costume and held onto my action figure while reciting the lines from the movie.cheers for our childhood.,Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie
