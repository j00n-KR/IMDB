0,Leofwine_draca,"Bland, derivative, soulless",4,3 December 2017,"SEVENTH SON is yet another cookie-cutter Hollywood fantasy adventure blockbuster aimed at the kid and teenage crowd. It feels virtually identical to THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE, a Nicolas Cage movie, albeit with a cod-medieval setting rather than the real world of the Cage movie. Jeff Bridges - who gives an embarrassingly poor copy of Ian McKellen's role as Gandalf throughout - plays a ghost-busting witch finder who takes on an apprentice (in the form of dull nice guy Ben Barnes) to battle an evil witch, played by the hideous overacting Julianne Moore. What with roles in this and R.I.P.D., you get the impression that Bridges has become one of the lazier actors in Hollywood these days.The plot is merely a series of dialogue exchanges dotted between the big CGI set-pieces showing our heroes fighting giant monsters, getting captured, and occasionally falling in love. Alicia Vikander, nowadays a big actress in her own right, shows up as the love interest but makes no impression whatsoever, while Kit Harington has a cameo so brief as to be pointless. The CGI is fairly good - you'd expect it to be given the budget - but the film has absolutely no character of its own and thus feels uniformly bland and derivative.",Seventh Son
1,SnoopyStyle,"growling, grumpy, dull",4,27 November 2015,"The witch Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) is imprisoned down a pit by Gregory (Jeff Bridges). Long time after, Malkin escapes and John Gregory is the last of the knights of the order of Falcons. She kills his apprentice William Bradley. He recruits a replacement, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), who is a farm boy and the seventh son of a seventh son. Tom rescues Alice (Alicia Vikander) who is about to be burnt as a witch. She's the daughter of Malkin's sister Lizzie (Antje Traue). Malkin intends to wreck havoc with her minions as the Blood Moon rises.The first mistake is to kill off cutie pie Kit Harington. He's the star of the movie for the first ten minutes. The movie is left with the growling Bridges and the weaker Ben Barnes. This has no joy or fun. It is a growling, grumpy, dull affair. It's got plenty of whirling CGI but none of it is that compelling. There are more than a few incidences of clunky writing. This is an overblown dour fantasy.",Seventh Son

Years later, she escapes from the pit and Master Gregory and his apprentice Mr. Bradley (Kit Harington) hunt her down. However Mother Malkin kills Mr. Bradley and flees to a derelict castle that she restores with magic. She meets her sister Bony Lizzie (Antje Traue) and her niece Alice (Alicia Vikander) and plans to destroy Master Gregory to begin her kingdom of evil. Meanwhile the old hunter recruits the naive farmer Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), who is the seventh son of the seventh son of the Ward family, to team up with him and his partner Tusk (John DeSantis) to hunt down Mother Malkin. Tom's mother (Olivia Williams), who is secretly a good witch, gives a necklace with a magic stone to protect him. They head to the village where Tom meets Alice and falls in love with her. But what is the true intention of Alice? Will they succeed in destroying the powerful Mother Malkin?""Seventh Son"" is a fantasy film indicated for fans of the genre. The story is full of action, with romance, funny situations and great CGI. There is a cameo of Kit ""Jon Snow"" Harington in the role of Master Gregory's apprentice; the gorgeous Julianne Moore does not seem to age and performs the evil Mother Malkin; Olivia Williams has a minor but important role of the mother and good witch; the Swedish actress Antje Traue, the Ava of ""Ex-Machina"", is very beautiful and talented. However Jeff Bridges disappoints with a weird way of speaking, maybe with the intention of looking older. In the end, ""Seventh Son"" works perfectly well on DVD. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Sétimo Filho"" (""The Seventh Son"")",Seventh Son
3,nogodnomasters,LEGEND AND NIGHTMARE ARE ALIVE,4,29 November 2018,"This is a simple story of good vs. evil. Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) is a knight/spook and the last of his kind who fights ""creatures of the dark."" He is up against a bunch of them lead by Mother Malkin (Julianna Moore) and not Maleficent as that would lead to a lawsuit. Gregory has been going through apprentices like water and has been following in the latest Hollywood B movie craze by having our hero being someone who drinks too much. His next apprentice to help him fight evil is the seventh son of a seventh son, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) a scrawny pig farmer who likes to throw knives. He has his own secret. There is also Alice (Alicia Vikander) the niece of Mother Malkin who adds a Romeo and Juliet element to the tale.I liked the special effects and Julianne Moore as the witch, but who cast ""The Dude"" in the role of the Master? It was horrible. It ruined an otherwise good film.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of killing.",Seventh Son
4,kosmasp,Being last,6,13 March 2016,"I think another reviewer put it nicely when he wrote, that this is neither a disaster nor a classic. It can be entertaining though, if you let yourself into the fantasy world. You've got really good actors in this and they're having fun. Jeff Bridges seems to channel a bit of Tom Hardy, though it's hard to tell sometimes the way he talks (in this case it's slightly different and almost to earnest for the tone of the movie itself, which is way lighter).But you also have the recently Oscar winning Vikander and Ms. Moore, both wonderful in their own rights. The special effects are decent too, though I didn't watch the 3D version, so I can't say how those worked out for the movie. It's a family affair mostly, even if it gets a bit dark from time to time.",Seventh Son

6,CinemaSerf,"""Stardust"" goes witch-hunting via ""Narnia""",6,10 April 2020,"It certainly had a bumpy road to the screen, this little fantasy - and, all told, is just about worth it. An evil witch queen (Julianne Moore) has long since been imprisoned in a pit; when she escapes to wreak havoc, it falls on her erstwhile captor ""Master Gregory"" (Jeff Bridges) and his apprentice to recapture her. Easier said than done as she disposes of the trainee and holes up in her newly restored castle awaiting her pursuer - now, less than ably, assisted by the seventh son of the seventh son - ""Tom Ward"" (Ben Barnes). It's quite a good fun little magical adventure. It certainly lacks originality, but there are decent efforts from the two stars; Barnes is a little better than his usual eye-candy standard and there are plenty of recognisable faces in support - alongside Alicia Vikander - the rather feisty ""Alice"". It's still got some decent action adventure elements to it, dragons and the like and the special effects are fine - though some of the fight scenes are a bit lengthy, the dialogue is a little wordy. It has the advantage of being largely forgettable, so you will be able to watch it again without really remembering who did what to whom.",Seventh Son
7,zardoz-13,Recycled Fantasy Fodder,5,10 February 2015,"Oscar-winning actor Jeff Bridges has made many memorable movies. ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" ""Jagged Edge,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""The Fisher King,"" ""Fearless,"" ""Against All Odds,"" ""Men Who Stare at Goats,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""True Grit,"" and ""Crazy Heart"" stand out among the more than 60 theatrical features that he has starred in since he started acting back in the 1970s. Bridges' latest outing ""Seventh Son"" proves that he can make an occasional stinker, too. Making his English-language film debut, Oscar-nominated Russian director Sergey Bodrov, who helmed the 1997 Tolstoy tale ""Prisoners of the Mountains,"" has spared no expense in bringing this sprawling but predictable $95-million, medieval fantasy to the screen. A posse of demon-possessed souls that can turn into voracious supernatural beasts tangle with our venerable hero and his naïve sidekick as the two struggle to vanquish an unforgiving witch. Interestingly, this larger-than-life adaptation of retired English teacher Joseph Delaney's young adult novel ""The Spook's Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch,"" the first of fourteen books in his ""Wardstone Chronicles,"" has generated greater enthusiasm overseas. Chinese and Russian audiences flocked to it. Meantime, American audiences have shunned it, and box office analysts have branded this Universal Pictures release as a flop based on its dismal opening weekend receipts of little more than $7 million.""Seventh Son"" opens as the last of the Falcon Knights, Master John Gregory (Jeff Bridges of ""TRON""), locks up the malevolent Queen of Witches, Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore of ""The Big Lebowski""), in an oubliette in a remote mountain range. Gregory and Malkin, it seems, once loved each other. Gregory abandoned Malkin for another woman, and the jealous Malkin killed Gregory's wife. Gregory retaliated and imprisoned Malkin for what he thought would be an eternity. Designated as a 'Spook,' Gregory earns his living as a spell-casting, witch-busting, dragon slayer equipped with a flame-throwing staff. He has dedicated himself tirelessly to the destruction of anything supernatural that frightens common folk. Despite Gregory's elaborate precautions, Mother Malkin breaks out of captivity many years later as a result of a centennial lunar event termed 'the Blood Moon.' The Blood Moon revitalizes Malkin's evil powers, enabling this witch to transform into a winged dragon, and flap away to her own mountain-top fortress. Master Gregory and young apprentice William Bradley (Kit Harington of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"") recapture this diabolical dame with arrows and a silver net. Unfortunately, Malkin kills poor Bradley, and Gregory must recruit a new apprentice. Gregory comes across another 'seventh son of a seventh son,' Tom Ward (Ben Barnes of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian""), a farm boy living in relative obscurity who slops his father's swine. Tom reminded me of Luke Skywalker when he appears initially in ""Star Wars."" Anyway, Tom takes advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to escape from a life of drudgery. Surprisingly enough, Tom had visions of his chance encounter before Gregory actually bargained with his dad to apprentice him. Meantime, Tom's doting mother, Mam Ward (Olivia Williams of ""Sabotage""), entrusts her son with a unique magical pedant to wear out-of-sight around his neck. While Gregory tutors Tom about witches, Malkin assembles her own culturally diverse posse of sinister shape-shifters. Initially, Malkin enlists the aid of her younger sister Bony Lizzie (Antje Traue of ""Pandorum"") as well as Bony's pretty niece Alice (Alicia Vikander of ""Ex Machina""), who are witches, too. Alice beguiles young Tom and keeps the lad hoodwinked for about three-fourths of the film until he wises up about her treachery. Ultimately, Malkin and her devils lure both Gregory and Tom into her own mountain-top fortress for a fight to the death under a blood red moon.Essentially, ""Seventh Son"" suffers from second-rate scripting despite its impressive scribes: ""Blood Diamond's"" Charles Leavitt, ""Eastern Promises'"" Steven Knight and ""Reign of Fire's"" Matt Greenberg. These guys have scrapped most of Delaney's narrative in favor of something more bombastically cinematic but at the same time hopelessly incoherent. Principally, the characters lack depth, dimension, and/or decadence. If you've seen ""Season of the Witch"" with Nicolas Cage and ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, you'll know when to yarn during the formulaic, by-the-numbers, adventures. Mumbling as if with a mouthful of marbles, a bearded Jeff Bridges appears to be imitating not only his own cantankerous ""True Grit"" character Rooster Cogburn, but also he channels a combination of Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan from the original ""Star Wars"" and Ian McKellen's Gandalf the Grey from the ""Hobbit"" movies. Whereas Obi-Wan and Gandalf emerged as flamboyant, Gregory is far from flamboyant. His best scene takes place in a tavern where he wields a cup of ale without spilling a drop to thrash a presumptuous swordsman. Oscar nominated actress Julianne Moore restrains herself as a despicable witch who can morph into an airborne dragon, entwine adversaries with her chain-link tail, and then skewer them without uttering a clever line. Mind you, this description of Moore's character sounds like she could have had a blast indulging herself, but she refuses to chew the scenery. Comparatively, Moore's lavishly attired, red-haired sorceress is nowhere as audacious as Charlize Theron's wicked witch in ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Sadly, secondary leads Ben Barnes and Alicia Vikander generate neither charisma as stock characters nor chemistry as an amorous couple. Barnes is about as wooden as Hayden Christensen was in the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Meanwhile, talented thespians like Olivia Williams, Kip Harrington, Djimon Hounsou, and Jason Scott Lee languish on the periphery of this synthetic sword and sorcery saga.Although it drums up minimal intensity between fade-in and fade-out, ""Seventh Son"" boasts some lively combat scenes that the 3-D visual effects enhance. ""Star Wars"" visual effects specialist John Dykstra has created several outlandish CGI monsters, but few are terrifying. The picturesque mountains of British Columbia are as scenic as ""Canterbury Tales"" production designer Dante Ferretti's sets are spectacular. Unfortunately, ""Seventh Son"" recycles the usual dungeons and dragon shenanigans with little to distinguish it from its prestigious predecessors.",Seventh Son
8,Calicodreamin,Fairly good,6,18 August 2020,A decent fantasy witch / witch hunter story. Fairly predictable plot and decent acting. The cinematography and costuming make this movie.,Seventh Son
9,neil-476,Flawed fantasy,7,3 April 2015,"Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) is a Spook, a kind of witch hunter / monster chaser. Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), a witch he imprisoned years before, has escaped and during a failed attempt to recapture her, Gegory's apprentice is killed so he recruits Thomas (Ben Barnes), the Seventh Son (of a Seventh Son) of the title, with only a short period in which to give him basic training before the Blood Moon reaches fullness and Mother Malkin's powers are at their greatest. Matters get complicated when Thomas falls for Alice, the daughter of Mother Malkin's sister.I was weaned on Ray Harryhausen, so this fantasy, with its grubby mediaeval setting and dragons, monsters, magic and swordfights, should have been right up my street. And, in many ways, it was. But I'm not sure whether my innate leaning towards the material is sufficient to overpower the many, many flaws.For instance, while the effects are good, it is often difficult to see exactly what's going on because, like so many films these days, everything is incredibly dark and there is constant rapid cutting between close-up frenetic action. Jeff Bridges, perhaps in the belief that he is giving value for money in a role where the pay cheque may have been the main factor in his decision to accept it, affects another variation in the growly obscured diction he used in True Grit and R.I.P.D., albeit overlaid with a dense English-based accent. He is difficult to understand: I wondered why Julianne Moore's character was called Malcolm, it wasn't until the final credits that I realised that her name was Malkin (why ""Mother""? She has no children). And, somewhere between the script and direction, something went very wrong, because this very straightforward story is badly told. There are frequent leaden attempts at humour, unconvincing dialogue, inadequate exposition in places where it doesn't fit, and a cast who speak their lines as best they can but without the commitment which they might have been able to find had their characters been better written.This was a disappointment. With a decent script, and had I been able to see what was going on, this could have been a classic.",Seventh Son
10,ferguson-6,Blood Moon Rising,5,5 February 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fantasy adventure films based on popular novels have certainly posted a track record of box office success  sometimes in record-setting style. However, not every entry into this genre need be a Goliath like the ""Harry Potter"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchises. There is always room for simpler and still-creative movie-making like The NeverEnding Story or Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Based on Joseph Delancey's ""The Wardstone Chronicles"" (17 novels), this latest from Russian director Sergey Bodrov strives to be something special. Though it falls short of such a lofty goal, it still provides an entertaining onslaught to the senses.A release date delayed by two years is rarely a good sign for a movie, though the official word blames it on legal issues between studio and distributor. No matter to us viewers, as what we care about is seeing something new and exciting. The steady stream of 3D special effects have their moments, but it's impossible not to notice the out-of-focus issues that abound in post-production 3D. Still the swooping camera work through the mountains, Grand Canyon, bodies of water, and very cool looking temples and walled cities, provide the ""epic"" look a film like this must offer. An extremely heavy dose of CGI must have kept quite a few programmers employed, and the effects bounce between quite impressive and totally flat. Personally, I never get tired of seeing angry dragons  even if it happens 3 or 4 times in the same movie.Let's talk about Jeff Bridges as Master Gregory, the town spook (creature hunter). Evidently Mr Bridges only accepts roles these days that don't require a haircut  or even a shower. But what's with that voice? The first time Master Gregory opens his mouth, I immediately thought it sounded like his Rooster Cogburn in True Grit taking a big swig of bourbon and, before swallowing, delivering his lines of dialogue. This voice is a creative choice that crashes and burns. Dialogue is of little use if the audience can't understand. As challenging as it was for me, it's expected that most of the target market will be totally lost in Gregory's exchanges with his apprentice or his sidekick or any of the wicked witches.The obvious attempt to set up a franchise, or at least a sequel, suffers from another fatal error. Asking Ben Barnes (playing apprentice Tom Ward) to carry the torch is just not reasonable. His wooden approach in The Chronicles of Narnia reminded of Orlando Bloom (that's not a compliment), and this outing just reinforces that original impression. The hulking sidekick Tusk is played by John DeSantis, and rather than stress his loyalty, we get a few lame jokes at his expense. Julianne Moore takes on the role of the powerful witch Mother Malkin, and though she gives it a shot, the role is simply underwritten and fizzles rather than sizzles. Other support work comes from Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair) as a young witch smitten with the apprentice, Olivia Williams as the mother-with-a-secret to the apprentice, while Jason Scott Lee and Djimon Hounsou each play talented, other worldly creatures.It's a bit surprising that the story isn't more complex and the characters better developed given the screen writing team of Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) and Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Locke, ""Peaky Blinders""). We just never get a chance to understand the legacy of Master Gregory and his spurned girlfriend-witch Mother Malkin. We also are expected to take a huge leap of faith when the apprentice can't accurately throw a knife in one scene, and shortly he is battling assassins, witches and other creatures. Perhaps the only explanation needed is that he is a ""son of a witch"".Big Lebowski fans will get a kick out of seeing Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore reunited on screen, even if we wish their battles were fiercer. And while it's nice to learn that four arms can really improve one's swordplay, it's a bit disappointing to miss out on the true power of a Blood Moon. Enjoy the visuals, duck from the dragons, and strain to understand the words coming out of the mouth of Master Gregory  there is some entertainment value here.",Seventh Son
11,FlashCallahan,Bridges should come with subtitles.....,5,28 March 2015,"John Gregory, who is a seventh son of a seventh son and also the local spook, has protected the country from witches, boggarts, ghouls and all manner of things supernatural. But John is not young anymore, and has been seeking an apprentice to carry on his trade. Most have failed to survive. The last hope is a young farmer's son named Thomas Ward. Will he survive the training to become the spook that so many others couldn't? And if he does, how can Thomas stand a chance against Mother Malkin, the most dangerous witch in the county........Again, with these Young Adult novel adaptations being released every other week it seems, I haven't read the source material, and to be honest, I have no intention of reading them, as I'm an adult, but certainly not that young anymore.But what made me want to see this was the controversy surrounding the film, rather than the plot, or narrative, because this has almost the same problems as this years Jupiter Ascending, which, to be honest, was lots of fun.This was pushed back a year, and there was talks of Moore 'Norbiting' her chances of Oscar glory (thankfully not so).But whilst this has elements that really work, it's crushingly disappointing, because somewhere in this mess, there is a wonderful movie desperate to come out.Bridges is as reliable as ever, reliable in the fact that maybe 20% of his dialogue is audible! and Moore seems to be having a ball as the queen witch, looking stunning and spouting her lines out with relative glee. It's just that Ben Barnes doesn't cut it as the apprentice, and the chemistry between him and the love interest is sparse.The effects are a little bit strange, and there were times when this could have been an Uwe Boll movie, it had his feel to it, and if you've seen any of his movies, you will know what I mean, especially when there are any scenes on horseback.There are some great scenes though, and the big set piece with the Boggart is something you would expect from a Middle Earth set piece.But set pieces do not make a movie, ask Michael Bay (in fact, don't), you need believable characters, coherent narrative, and decent editing, which this is sorely lacking.It's this generations Masters Of The Universe, make of that what you will.....",Seventh Son
12,phd_travel,We've seen it all before and better,2,14 July 2015,This movie is terribly deja vu. The sets scenery monsters all are a bit familiar. I guess they were stuck with a story that wasn't terribly interesting a witch vs hunter. But then why choose this story for a movie? The casting isn't great. Jeff Bridges speaks with a strange mumble that makes you appreciate the British actors in similar roles. Ben Barnes isn't quite leading man material and it shows. Alicia Vikander who seems to be getting all sorts of roles isn't quite special enough. Her face is a bit ordinary. Julianne Moore is beautiful and she hams it up as the evil witch although Jolie and Theron had better material to work with in similar roles recently.Don't bother. Even fantasy buffs will find this one dull.,Seventh Son
13,siderite,Mindbogglingly bad!,5,5 January 2015,"I have read a few books from the Spook's Apprentice series and I can tell you with certainty that this movie is very far from the plot there. Worst than that, every decent scene in the film is in the trailer and the rest are just filling. No real fights, no real drama, the acting was abysmal, but it pales in comparison with the script, which seems to be have been written by a banker worrying he is giving the world too much. It is a horribly bad film that I advise against watching.The books themselves are a sort of Harry Potterish thing for children, replacing Hogwarts with a grumpy fighter against the creatures of the dark and Harry with a rare ""seventh son of a seventh son"" that is traditionally employed in this ""spook"" business. There were several things that went against this series becoming very popular: first is the term ""spook"" which in the US was controversial due to some colloquial racial meaning, so they changed the name with which they published the book into The Last Apprentice. Then the name of the author, Joseph Delaney, which is pretty common and easy to confuse with other writers named Delaney.However the plot of the books is easy to follow, interesting, sometimes engaging; Delaney had just as much right for fame as J.K. Rowling. Alas, this film pretty much cements his failure. Too bad.",Seventh Son

'Seventh Son' Synopsis: When Mother Malkin, the queen of evil witches, escapes the pit she was imprisoned in by professional monster hunter Spook decades ago and kills his apprentice, he recruits young Tom, the seventh son of the seventh son, to help him.'Seventh Son' has a tepid first-hour, where only the visual glory arrests your attention. The second-hour fares much better & the climatic fight between the Good & Evil, is excellently done. However, the pacing is inconsistent.The Screenplay by Charles Leavitt & Steven Knight is average. Sergei Bodrov's Direction is crisp. Cinematography & Editing are below the mark. Graphics are terrific & the mainstay of the enterprise. Performance-Wise: Jeff Bridges is in total hamming mode & yet he's delightful & engaging. His is the only performance that stands out here. Ben Barnes lacks screen presence. Julianne Moore doesn't make for a frightful menace.On the whole, 'Seventh Son' has some merits, but it definitely could've been better.",Seventh Son
15,KineticSeoul,Well the trailer was better once again,4,25 June 2015,"Well the trailer made this movie look cool and fun. It just seemed like a fantasy movie on adrenaline. But the actual product sort of ended up being a disappointment. Despite the close to a 100 million dollars budget. This movie is worse then ""47 Ronin"". This has a mix of quite a bit of fantasy elements clashed into one. Such as warlocks, witches, shapshifters, sword wielding fields, giants and etc. But everything just seemed so darn tacked on despite it being based on a book series. To sum it up, this movie had potential but it seemed to have gotten in the hands of the wrong director. It's just a mess with poor editing and silly action sequences. Overall, despite Jeff Bridges over the top, but entertaining performance this movie is easily forgettable. I would not watch it again. It's a movie filled with magic, but just wasn't magical.4.5/10",Seventh Son
16,Hellmant,"I had a really hard time just staying awake, for it's entirety!",7,11 February 2015,"'SEVENTH SON': Three Stars (Out of Five)Fantasy adventure flick based on the 2004 book 'The Spook's Apprentice', by Joseph Delaney. The film stars Jeff Bridges and Ben Barnes; as a 'spook', humanity's defender against evil supernatural forces, and his apprentice. The movie also stars Julianne Moore, Alicia Vikander, Antje Traue, Olivia Williams, Djimon Hounsou, Jason Scott Lee and Kit Harington. It was directed by Sergey Bodrov and written by Matt Greenberg, Charles Leavitt and Steven Knight. The film was delayed two years from it's original release date and is a box office bomb. I can see why.Bridges plays Master John Gregory; the seventh son of a seventh son, and also a local spook. Gregory has long defended his country against evil witches, ghouls and other monsters. He is constantly looking for an apprentice, to take over for him when he's gone, as the ones he enlists, keep dying. His latest apprentice is a farmer's son, named Tom Ward (Barnes). The two spend most of the film's running length, gruelingly training for battle; against an evil witch, named Mother Malkin (Moore), and her army of evil spirits.The movie cost $95 million to make and it looks great. The acting is all decent and the action scenes aren't bad. Still the movie is extremely boring. There's no originality to it and the story, and characters, just aren't very interesting. I had a really hard time just staying awake, for it's entirety. It's got nearly all of the important ingredients, for a good fantasy adventure film, but it just doesn't come together right. Ultimately it's pretty forgettable.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GZMz2QipSqQ",Seventh Son
17,Buddy-51,Low-grade action film,4,8 September 2015,"About the only really interesting thing about ""Seventh Son,"" a decidedly low-grade sword-and-sorcery epic, is the fact that Kit Harington (Jon Snow from ""Game of Thrones"") didn't have to go through much of a wardrobe change to participate in this project. It's a good thing, however, that he didn't quit his day job, for Harington's character is done away with in no time flat (a positive outcome for the actor, as it turns out). But Harington isn't the only one who finds himself slumming it here. Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Olivia Williams and Djimon Hounsou are also mired in this CGI-heavy travesty.Based on ""The Spook's Apprentice"" by Joseph Delaney, it's the oldie about the aging knight (Bridges) who's training a reluctant apprentice (Ben Barnes), a seventh son of a seventh son, in the fine art of killing witches, all in the name of protecting the weak and defending the innocent. There are also beasts to be slain, with the occasional timeout for lesson-learning and puppy love romance. But none of it really adds up to much in the end, and hopefully all involved will quickly move onto bigger and better things in the future.",Seventh Son

19,Robert_duder,An unfortunate failure that was actually very very entertaining,8,26 March 2015,"After seeing a trailer or two I was actually quite excited about seeing Seventh Son. Its been awhile since I've seen a good fantasy medieval film and I was looking forward to it. I am very pleased to say that this was nearly a perfect and fun popcorn flick and well worth my time. I'm actually very disappointed that it isn't doing better because I think they could certainly have turned this into a franchise and I couldn't help but think that the film leads into what could be a really terrific TV Series as well. The film however tanked and that won't be happening but please don't let that deter you from checking this out especially if you enjoy the genre. The story is terrific, the cinematography is great and the story is decent. It has a good cast and terrific action scenes. It has an old school fantasy vibe to it but everything works quite well. It isn't brilliant and it would never take home any awards but I was completely entertained and I would watch it again and that marks a good film in my book. The pacing is good and it has plenty of action to keep you hooked. The romantic storyline is also surprisingly good as well.Ben Barnes leads the cast very well as the latest apprentice to a monster hunter. Barnes has a lot of charisma on screen and he pulls off the role well. I think that at the very least he should get noticed for his part in the film. The always amazing Jeff Bridges plays the haggard and grizzled hunter. He steals every scene he is in (although I'm getting a little tired of his grumbling and muffled growl lately) and he and Barnes are terrific together. Bridges wins you over quickly and is a great character. Julianne Moore (who I have decided to now become a fan of after years of being annoyed by her, because of her literally brilliant performance in Still Alice) is pretty good as the evil villainess and witch. She is a little campy and over the top but it works in the context of the film and the story between her and Bridges is quite good. Alicia Vikander is beautiful first of all but she does well as the romantic lead for Barnes. They have really good chemistry and some great scenes together. The various cameos of villains and heroes along the way are familiar and all quite good.The story is that this film went through some very hard times during production including switching directors and casting issues and all kinds of things. Usually a film that has that many issues ends up not doing well and this was no exception. Director Sergey Bodrov has a fair bit of experience in the genre and behind the camera but I'm not sure he knew what to do with this sort of budget and that might be his biggest problem. Still he does some amazing things with the scenery and the special effects are excellent. There really is truly nothing wrong with this film. I don't understand all the backlash against it. Its not Lord of The Rings but it is very entertaining and that for me is good enough! I do absolutely recommend giving it a chance. 8/10",Seventh Son

21,851222,One of the worst movies i have ever saw,2,24 April 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Seventh Son"" (2014) is simply one of the biggest train wreck's i have ever saw and i saw lot of movie - LOT OF MOVIES.Nothing works in this piece of garbage, this is the only Word i can find for this movie - garbage. It's not intriguing, not involving, not interesting, super badly written, badly directed, edited in ""chop / chop"" MTV style and what's most surprising badly acted - this is the bottom of motion picture art.In general i love movies, watch tons of them and try to find some good things in every one of them, but ""Seventh Son"" is in another level of bad movie making. When you have in your movie 2 Oscar winners, and one 2 times nominee, how is it even possible to direct them in their simply worst acting roles? Check out this garbage for the answer. What is more amusing that director of this movie is very well known Russian director, and a very good one actually, but here ... i would really like to know what happened behind this project and how come so many great movie talents behind it could come up with this result.Overall, avoid this so called movie at any cost. Do not rent it, do not watch it - it's the worst 1 h 30 min you can spend on watching movie. When i was watching this garbage, i was simply ashamed of it. It's THAT bad.",Seventh Son
22,The-Sarkologist,Another fantasy adventure to satisfy your appetite,7,8 March 2015,"I'm going to give this a reasonably high rating because I actually quite enjoyed it, though I have since discovered that it has been absolutely plastered by the critics. Okay, I agree that it is the same tired old fantasy story with some great special effects, and it did feel a little lame, especially as we get to the end of the film, but that didn't mean I didn't like it. I have certainly seen worse, and it is a good dose of fantasy that is short enough not to drag and long enough to keep me satisfied.The story is about the seventh son of a seventh son who, surprisingly, has magical abilities. Now, the world is about to be threatened by an evil witch as the blood moon approaches, and the only man that can stand up to her, a spook (read witch hunter) named Gregory, has lost his last apprentice. So with very little time available he grabs the only option available – Tom, in an attempt to train him up so that they can stop the coming apocalypse.There are a couple of funny things with this film, such as Tom dreaming of one day leaving his farm and becoming great. Isn't this just so Hollywood. I sometimes wonder if peasants ever thought that, especially the young adults, who have probably had the fact that they will be a peasant for the rest of their lives beaten into them since they were a child. Okay, people dream, but I found it interesting that this idea of the dreamer packing up and leaving for great adventures as something that always appears in Hollywood, and in fantasy literature of all stripes, but is never really true for the real world.Then there is this idea about witches. Why is it that witches are always evil? I suspect that it has something to do with our Christian heritage, and also that the term has been tarnish with the picture of devil worshipers. To me a witch is probably more of a herbalist that lived by herself as opposed to a practitioner of dark magic. However this idea has come down to us, and to me, having a bunch of witches as the villains of the piece is also another tired cliché that I am getting a little sick hearing. However, despite that, I liked the movie, and so did my brother, so I guess that is all that counts.",Seventh Son

Sure it was a little hasty at some points and a little too cliché at some others, not to mention that the evil creatures weren't that terrifying, but it was enjoyable and had enough action to be interesting. The whole atmosphere of the film was that medieval, witch hunting, dark ages short of atmosphere, so that helped a lot.

25,leonblackwood,Bridges smashes it! Shame about the rest of the cast! 5/10,5,10 August 2015,"Review: My expectations for this movie well wasn't that high but I quite enjoyed it. The Seventh Son character was totally useless and he seemed to get in the way most of the time but Jeff Bridges was brilliant, even though I didn't understand what the hell he was saying most of the time. Its a basic good against evil type of plot with loads of ghouls and goblins along the way. Jeff Bridges plays Master Gregory, an old warrior who destroys witches and evil goblins. After his apprentice gets killed by an evil witch, he searches for the Seventh Son to help him to fight against evil. After taking Tom from his family, he puts him through training, which includes various potions and sword fighting and then they set out on a quest to fight against the evil queen Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore). The CGI looked pretty impressive and the various goblins looked quite gruesome. The only problem was the guy who was playing the Seventh Son (Ben Barnes) who really didn't have any screen charisma at all. His acting was weak and quite annoying but Jeff Bridges was great. It could have done without the love story, which just made it corny after a while but the action scenes made up for it. I liked the pace of the film and Julianne Moore was good as the evil ice Queen but it won't go down as a classic like some other movies in this genre. Watchable!Round-Up: At 65 years old, Jeff Bridges looked pretty impressive with a sword, or should I say his body double did. He really does stand out from the rest in this film and I doubt that it would have been half as good without him. Ben Barnes, 33, wasn't the greatest choice by the director but he might be better in the sequel, if they ever make one. He starred in the lead as Dorian Gray and he played Caspian in the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe franchise so he isn't new to the epic movies. Anyway, the film was directed by Sergey Bodrov who brought you the Mongol franchise and a few Russian movies which I can't pronounce. He did quite a good job with this film and he did get the most out of Bridges but it wasn't that original and it just about made a profit at the box office. Budget: $95million Worldwide Gross: $111millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasy movies about an old warrior who trains his apprentice to kill witches and mystical goblins. 5/10",Seventh Son

Everything from the production values to the acting to the story to... just about everything. It's not even that clichéd, but neither it's that inventive. It falls into that awkward middle zone. It's just average.And that's the worst crime a movie like this can be. It means it's boring. It means it won't stick with you. It means you'll forget it as soon as you've finished watching it.And sure, there are a couple good things going for it. Like Jeff Bridges, who doesn't exactly shine here, with his weird accent, that sounds like he's suffering from a permanent bee sting to his tongue, and his general Jeff Bridges maneuvers, but at least he's memorable and fun to watch.

This is a period piece that takes place during the renaissance era-I was looking to see if anyone was selling turkey legs in the market place scenes, but no such luck-when witches and dragons and other assorted beasties roamed the earth. It's based on a series of books called The Last Apprentice. Jeff plays a spook, sort of a hired gun or exterminator, for when someone needs a witch, dragon or some other evil monster taken care of. Jeff has gone through a lot of apprentices-they don't seem to have long life expectancies in this line of work because Jeff just doesn't have enough time to properly train them before they get themselves killed. Ben is the latest apprentice, who is a seventh son of a seventh son, which seems to be an odd job requirement. Julianne is the evil Queen witch, who happens to have a past with Jeff and Alicia is a witch/human hybrid that could be good or bad, depending on her feelings for Ben-she has a crush on him. The effects are descent but there is not much new, as far as the story telling goes. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours.

The premise of the film sees a witch hunter get a new apprentice in order to stop an army of withes. Jeff bridges character was quite fun in this film but he had a lack of depth to his character and at Times it was a bit hard to understand him. Julianne moore was also pretty good in this film as the villain witch even though her character also lacked depth. Ben barnes plays the apprentice in this film and he is just so dull and we are never given a reason to even start liking this character. Also even though Alicia vikander is a good actress there is just no chemistry between the two and it really hurts the film. The story is really basic and lacks any depth to it or its characters. The script is poor as well with no drama or humour added to make the film fun. The style has some pretty fun action scenes but also has an over reliance on cgi that come across poorly. Overall this is a poor film that doesn't hit the levels it should.,Seventh Son
32,estebangonzalez10,A fantasy epic adventure that wastes a very talented cast,5,14 April 2015,"""We will meet again.""Seventh Son is Sergey Bodrov's (Mongol) latest fantasy epic film starring Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Alicia Vikander, and Ben Barnes. It's a big budget adaptation of Joseph Delaney's novel, The Spook's Apprentice, which failed to make a splash at the box office. It is set in a Tolkien-like fantasy world where supernatural forces live among humans. There are witches, warlocks, boggarts, ghouls, and many other dark morphing creatures, and then there are spooks who protect the people by hunting down these monsters. Bodrov relies heavily on the CGI effects, but the film does look good thanks to its production design. Bridges plays the sole remaining spook, Master Gregory, who is trying to hunt down the extremely dangerous witch, Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore). Malkin plans on using her powers to reunite her followers and unleash evil across the world. After losing his latest apprentice (played by Kit Harrington), Gregory must train the young seventh son of a seventh son named Tom (Ben Barnes) who really doesn't seem to be an interesting prospect. He only has a week to train him before reaching Malkin and preventing her from fulfilling her evil plan. Along the way, Tom falls for a young witch named Alice (Alicia Vikander) who has been spying on them. She isn't a dark witch, but is following her mother's orders. Seventh Son doesn't take itself too seriously and Bodrov jumps from one action set piece to the next without spending too much time on the characters and thus not allowing the audience to think too much about the silliness of it all.The greatest disappointment is of course the weak screenplay that never allows us to engage with the characters despite being played by a fantastic cast. It's inevitable not to thing about The Big Lebowski when seeing Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore working together again. Moore had a fantastic year, winning the Oscar for her lead performance in Still Alice, but here she doesn't have anything interesting to do. She plays a typical and clichéd villain. Bridges goes extremely overboard with his character, reminding us that we shouldn't take this adventure film too seriously. It's hard to understand his drunken mumbling which will remind us of his work in True Grit. Olivia Williams and Djimon Hounsou also have some small roles in this film, so it is a huge disappointment to see such a talented cast wasted in a big budget film like this. Barnes and Vikander are young talented actors that try to do the best with the material they are given. The Swedish actress has taken Hollywood by storm after her performance in the Danish film, A Royal Affair, and she has five films coming out this year. She's an actress I will be keeping my eyes on. Seventh Son has been receiving terrible reviews, but it wasn't as bad as I had expected. The plot moves along very quickly and in a very predictable manner, but it never tries to take itself too seriously and that is Seventh Son's greatest strength. The action set pieces are fun and the film is short (under 95 minutes). Of course it isn't a good film either, but considering it is light for the eyes it's not a difficult film to watch. If you're bored you might find the film entertaining and it's a good way to kill time, but there is nothing memorable about it either. More than anything it's a huge disappointment for wasting such a talented cast. There's no character development, but the impressive set designs and quick pace make up for it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Seventh Son

Even A list actors such as Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges cannot save this, even though both gave good performances. The special effects were pretty good, not great but fair. The film just seemed to drag on and not accomplish much of anything. I just remember feeling very bored. It didn't help that I did not enjoy Ben Barnes as the lead here, I've liked him in other films, such as Narnia: Prince Caspian. I just didn't feel like he fit the lead role in Seventh Son. Although, I did like the costuming and the makeup, especially on Julianne Moore's character, Mother Malkin. The dialogue was sort of cheesy and clichéd. The plot was also clichéd and really thin. There was a small love story at one point, but it felt very forced to me, there didn't seem to be much chemistry between them, and then it ends up ending very awkward and abruptly.

35,3xHCCH,Typical Fantasy Action Film,6,8 January 2015,"Set in medieval times in Europe somewhere, ""Seventh Son"" brings us back to a time when supernatural beings like witches, ghosts, ghasts and the like wreak terror on the countryside. The people depend on a special knight called the ""Spook"" to fight these creatures and restore peace. Master Gregory is the last spook and he is getting on in age. In his last big fight with the grand witch Mother Malkin, he lost his latest apprentice Billy. Gregory searches for another ""seventh son of a seventh son"" to take his place. His quest leads him to the farm of the Wards. As the young impulsive Tom heeds the Spook's call, will he be up to the task of becoming the new Spook before Mother Malkin fully regains her powers by the night of the blood moon? Or will Tom's falling for the charms of pretty Alice distract him from his destiny?Cut down to its basic storyline, you would see a very common basic plot in many an adventure film: an old master training an heir-apparent to his position. This film takes that plot and brings into it fantastic monsters in action and teenage romance in bloom.Ben Barnes plays Tom Ward. Barnes first gained attention as Prince Caspian in the Narnia films, though his career did not really fly too much. He takes another stab at stardom with yet another action fantasy with this one. Already a adult man, Barnes seemed too old for the character he is supposed to play. Anyhow, he still has a youthful mien to pull it off. I think he was cast so that a romance angle can be developed as well.Jeff Bridges plays Master Gregory. He is at his hammy best here and he looks like he had a good time filming this. In fact, Bridges felt like he just reprised his role in last year's ""RIPD"", where he was a senior ghost policeman training a new recruit. Bridges had some witty ripostes which added the requisite humor to the proceedings.Julianne Moore goes all campy playing Mother Malkin with evil relish and glee. She gets to wear more witchy-chic than Maleficent and she seemed to be having a field day with this over-the-top character, much unlike the more serious and quiet ones she is more known for. In addition, she and her coven of powerful witches (played by Antje Traue, Djimon Hounsou, Jason Scott Lee, among others) get to transform into dragons and similarly fantastic beasts, thanks to neat and nifty computer- generated special effects. This film is based on the young adult novel ""The Spook's Apprentice"" written by Joseph Delaney. Unlike the atmospheric creepy book it was based on, the film is makes it more of an action fantasy for cinematic verve. Tom and Alice in the book are both pre-teens. The witch characters did not fit their descriptions in the book as well. They did not turn into animals, for one. In fact, one of the side characters, the deformed humanoid Tusk, even shifts over from evil in the book to good in the film.The visual effects were hit and miss, some (like the creature transformations) were impressive and seamless, but some (like the conflagrations) looked old-fashioned and garishly fake. Book fans may be disappointed by the major deviations from the original tale. Those who are unfamiliar with the book though will be entertained, but will definitely feel that the story being told by director Sergey Bodrov follows a tired and very familiar formula. 6/10.",Seventh Son
36,peterp-450-298716,This one was downright ridiculous at times.,4,8 April 2015,"˝You've spells, boy. What kind? Sometimes I...I see things. Things that haven't happened yet. Could be useful. Not the passing out part of course, but the visions.˝ Take the cartoon ""The Sword in the Stone"", add in a few ingredients of ""Willow"" and use a diminutive small portion of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and you'll get ""Seventh Son"" as a result. The umpteenth adaptation of a series of youth books and again a contribution to the fantasy genre. Now, I'm a huge fan of fantasy. Start a movie in which knights, magicians, dragons, trolls, witches, gnomes and other mythological creatures are introduced and I will be completely absorbed in this fairytale world. Unfortunately, this film is a huge mishmash of multiple facets of previously released movies (which at first sight shouldn't be a problem) .The biggest problem is the storyline. What an incomprehensible tangle this is. Had the seventh son of the seventh son seen this in his visions , he would leave without notice to an unknown destination and never be in touch again. It's certainly not the overly present CGI which is disappointing, although it doesn't look smooth all the time. It's mainly the interpretations that started to annoy, with front runner Jeff Bridges as Master Gregory. This mumbling pub visiting magician, better known as a Spook, is doing his utmost to come across as an unpleasant person. It seems like Bridges just copied his character from ˝R.I.P.D.˝. A mix between Catweazle and Gandalf but with a huge toothless lower jaw which ensures you can only hear an unintelligible stream of mumbled words coming from under his D'artagnan-like mustache. Besides a few witty and sarcastic quotes, you shouldn't expect any serious dialogs of this character. Ben Barnes interprets the lucky apprentice Tom Ward. A person without charisma who acts and looks quite dull and colorless. The only thing you can admire him for, is the fact that he worked his way up to savior of the world in a record time (the previous unfortunate was already 10 years an apprentice. He had to master it in 3 days. Respect!), because mankind is about to meet again with a gang of villains led by Mother Malkin. Julianne Moore attempts to depict Mother Malkin as a demonic witch who can transform effortlessly into an invincible flying dragon. However, it remains an attempt because she doesn't really look that frightening. As a person she looks to ordinary and her cleavage impressed me more at times than her acting performance. The fact that Bridges and Moore acted together in ˝The Big Lebowski˝ as The Dude and the daughter of Jeffrey Lebowski, probably made for a lovely reunion.But the biggest problem in ˝Seventh Son˝ was undoubtedly the total absence of any explanation. The seventh son of a seventh son has access to magical powers. I guess we have to take that for granted ? Gregory knew to outwit Mother Malkin one way or another in the past and saw a chance to lock her in a cave somewhere in a high mountain. He used a huge iron gate to close it completely. Apparently at that time Mother Malkin wasn't powerful enough to beat Master Gregory. That's quite obvious to me, since he was able to carry that huge fence together with her up the mountain. In the wake of Mother Malkin there was also an army of invincible figures. Probably they were at that moment astray I guess. And the term invincible is also something you should take with a grain of salt. They were eliminated without too much trouble. The multi-armed Shiva-like swordsman looks dangerously but disappears out of the picture in a ridiculous way. The course of the entire history is nowhere deepened and logical explanations remain off. Eventually you don't bother about the whole story anymore and continue to watch in a haze of total indifference with this recurring thought ˝Oh well, I guess it ought to be like this and it probably will be obvious to the savvy viewers. I'm obvious not part of that group.˝The CGI looks stunning but occasionally it simply sucks. The dialogs are quite comical at times, but mostly they feel contrived and uninspired. The whole is extremely predictable and some developments are downright ridiculous. That the half-witch Alice (Alicia Vikander) seduces Tom with a single glance. Now that's what I call magic. Ingenious opening sentences and flirting techniques aren't necessary those days I guess. The release of this film was delayed by one year. That alone you can interpret as a bad omen. It's pretty unlikely that they are going to make a motion picture of the subsequent books. Well, I'm not eagerly looking forward to that.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.com",Seventh Son

You never really care about Jeff Bridge's old master, or his new apprentice, or the apprentice's love interest. It tries to get you interested in those things, yet somehow just doesn't get it right.Ultimately, despite the action, the movie is a bit dull. The trouble is that we've all seen everything this movie has to offer in every other fantasy movie from the last ten, or even twenty, years. There's nothing new here and, as a result, the whole film seems like just a poor cash-in on the success of better movies.As I say, it isn't bad, just not good enough to make you sit up and pay attention. Once it is done, it is done, and it is doubtful you'll want to revisit it anytime soon.SUMMARY: Nothing new to see here.

42,fntstcplnt,Seventh Son (2014),3,14 January 2020,"Directed by Sergei Bodrov. Starring Jeff Bridges, Ben Barnes, Alicia Vikander, Julianne Moore, Antje Traue, Olivia Williams, Djimon Hounsou, Kit Harrington. (PG-13)Monster-hunting knight Bridges takes on a new apprentice (Barnes) to track down and slay big, bad witch Moore. Generic fantasy tripe with no story or characters to latch onto, a protagonist so bland it's easy to forget what he even looks like scene-to-scene (besides ""vaguely handsome""), uninspired vision and design, and yet another wretchedly chaotic jumble of bad effects and erratic editing pretending to be an exciting climactic battle. Cast has over a dozen Oscar nominations (and three wins) among them, but no one plays a character worth investing interest--Bridges dips into his eccentric codger playbook (unfortunately, the previous performance of his it most closely resembles is the one from the dreadful ""R.I.P.D.""), Moore vamps lifelessly, Vikander looks appropriately bored, and Hounsou is saddled with yet another small, thankless role in a CGI-heavy action movie. It feels like Bridges' character utters the phrase ""seventh son of a seventh son"" almost as many times as Bruce Dickinson...a drinking game, perhaps, to stave off the boredom?27/100",Seventh Son

45,petra_ste,The sheventh shon of a sheventh shon,5,23 July 2015,"An easy object of ridicule for its troubled production, underwhelming box office results and for Jeff Bridges' accent sounding like he has a gerbil stuck in his mouth, Seventh Son is actually better than expected, meaning it's harmless fantasy fluff rather than an unmitigated disaster. If I had watched this as a 13 years old I would probably have loved it, at least before forgetting it within two hours.Trite writing is salvaged to an extent by decent production values and a fine cast. Bridges sounds ridiculous but at least he doesn't commit the cardinal sin for this kind of silly movies, which is being boring; ditto for Julianne Moore in a campy turn as a witch queen. Ben Barnes is the anodyne protagonist - he makes one miss even perpetually morose Kit Harington (Game of Thrones's Jon Snow), who bites the dust in the prologue. Alicia Vikander fares better as the love interest.Supporting cast is solid, with Olivia Williams, Antje Traue and Djmon Hounsou, the latter now terminally typecast as fantasy/sci-fi henchman.Direction by Sergey Bodrov is competent, but Seventh Son needed flat-out amazing set-pieces to redeem the bland writing, not just a few brawls with whooshing knives, extras falling like ninepins and the queen's ethnically diverse lieutenants - looking like X-Men dropouts gathering for a Dungeons & Dragons cosplay - dispatched anticlimactically.Considering Bodrov made one of the greatest unknown gems of the Nineties (Prisoner of the Mountains) this seems, to put it mildly, quite a step back.5/10",Seventh Son

Mindless entertainment,6,28 May 2015,"I've rented many a film over the last year, knowing exactly what I was getting into, going-in with meager expectations, and all too often, even those haven't been met. Stathom's ""Wild Card"", ""In Cold Blood""... You know, films that you know aren't going to be great, but you just hope they keep your attention and fill whatever genre craving I happen to have that particular evening. This particular night, i craved some fantasy. Rented ""Dracula untold""(haven't watched yet), and this film. I was surprised by the a-list of actors - albeit some of them seem to be branching over to the 'slightly washed-up' category. Bridges is good as usual. His character adds just the right amount of brevity to the film. He's the glue here.The film is paced perfectly. I knew it was going to be alright when i read the word cliché' 10 times in the first 4written reviews. Thats usually a ""shoe-in"" for ""will exceed expectations"". ""The Seventh Son"" does travel over beaten paths, but it's still an entertaining passing of the time. It's better than ""Snow WHite and the Huntsmen"", ""Jack the Giant Slayer"", ""Season of the Witch"", and ""Prince of Persia"", but it's not quite as good as ""Maleficient"".

47,Seth_Rogue_One,Almost okay,5,2 October 2015,"This movie feels sort of like it was a 150 minute epos fantasy adventure that the movie-company deemed too slow and didn't have enough substance to entertain the viewer so it was cut down heavily to just 100 minutes.Now I don't know if that's the case or not, but it would make sense if it was because the movie takes a long time for the viewer to fathom what it is really about with not much character development to speak of (if any) and lacks any sort of depth or mystery which perhaps if the movie would have taken it's time it would have.Anyway, the acting is... passable, albeit very typical and filled with all the typical types of characters one can expect from this kind of movie, and played exactly the same way they have been played in countless movies before... Juliane Moore as the evil witch is a prime example.The special effects in this one are both hits and misses, occasionally they get it right but occasionally it looks almost like a SyFy presentation, the actual scenery is well filmed at all time though.So yeah, I reckon this is a movie that might come out with a extended director's cut at some point that will be far more full-fleshed but for now we have to settle for this watered down sausage.",Seventh Son

Proving me right is the fact that the release date kept getting pushed back It seems. I can see why, but the movie was not all bad, thanks to Jeff Bridges.I don't know if he was just doing this crap for a pay check. It's hard to tell cause it seems that Jeff will do a project if it looks like I'll be fun. You can feel that in his performance, this playfulness with the material.It's Similar to what he did in RIPD, which makes this movie look like Lord of the Rings.You go to see Bridges in it, despite the fact that his role is that of a knight who mentors The hero, the seventh son of a seventh son, to be a witch hunter. Wonder if the Iron Maiden song of the same name is also based on the book this movie is based on? Anyway, The actor who played the hero, who I don't known takes second stage to Bridges who steels the show with his perfect, ""I've been doing this so long it don't get to me"" persona. Julianne Moore was smartly cast in the movie as the antagonist. Totally right for the part, she's a sexy MILF, perfect to play a wicked which.The Visual effects were worthy of the best fantasy films out there. I especially loved the parts when the witches morphed into dragons. That was really awesome.The Characters were really cool as well but felt underdeveloped for my taste. This is most likely because I'm not familiar with the source material, however. It's like when I go see X-Men or a film in the Marvel cinematic universe, I love it when they make small cameo references to other characters from the comics. For those of you familiar with the book, it will most likely be a treat to see these cool characters who feel like they should have a bigger place in the movie, even for a brief second so your eyes can pop and you can be like ""that's such and such from the book!""But overall, I thought the story went by too quickly to get to know the hero and other characters that seem important.

51,ArchonCinemaReviews,Middle of the road film for fantasy aficionados,5,28 March 2015,"Seventh Son is a middle of the road feature, and you can take it or leave it, fantasy fans will take it and everyone else will leave it.Seventh Son reads as fanfic, not even a particularly poor one at that, it's just so uninspired and at times caricaturized that it never manages to be anything more than uninspired fantasy drivel.Apparently based loosely off a book by Joseph Delaney, Seventh Son follows a a master fighter of the dark arts (called Spooks) as he wards off witches and evil spirits, hopefully for good with his most recent apprentice Thomas, who he hopes will live long enough to pick up the trade.Even for the unknown film goer, something about Seventh Son doesn't seem copacetic, as if the typical Hollywood bludgeoning of creative material is in store, and it appears valid. There are cliché archetypes and interrelationships between characters and even the conflict in store for our characters is lame. The word that constantly comes to mind as you ruminate over the film is 'uninspired' which is a common complaint for films these days, but never more so applicable than with Seventh Son.The actors do a fine job in each of their roles, though Jeff Bridges is rather comical with his underbitten performance. Which wouldn't be a bad thing were it not for his eerily reminiscent performance in RIPD, down to the facial hair and scowl.Voracious devourers of fantastical lore and the ComicCon scene will probably like it, but besides that niche audience I can't see this film being worthy of a glance.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Seventh Son
52,p-jonsson,"Good, solid, fantasy adventure",7,3 May 2015,"This is a good, solid fantasy adventure. It is not a ""wow great"" kind of movie but definitely enjoyable to watch, at least if you are a fan of fantasy, magic, dragons and such like.The movie is based on a book which I have not read although I believe it is considered as a young adult book. The movie seems to reflect this in that it has a fairly simple, straightforward, adventure plot. This is a movie made to entertain with magic, adventure, a bit of humor and visual effects. Nothing more and nothing less.In my opinion it does so fairly well. I do like Jeff Bridges in his role as a rather wacky hunter of evil witches who have fallen into a dark and uncaring attitude towards the world around him. Uncaring about everything except slaying of witches that is. Ben Barnes, portraying the apprentice and Seventh Son is unfortunately making a rather bland impression. Then Julianne Moore is definitely better as the evil witch.No movie where fantasy, magic and dragons are among the main themes can be without special effects. So, not surprisingly, there are a fair amount of them in this movie. I think they are generally well made and complements the story well without being overdone.On the whole I liked the movie.

He's consistent so he's obviously doing what the director wanted but it's still disappointing and perplexing.

54,shawneofthedead,"Neither a disaster nor a classic, but decent, fun and action-packed in its own right.",6,2 January 2015,"It isn't easy to make a good fantasy film – as borne out by Seventh Son, which has suffered a particularly arduous journey to the silver screen. Originally slated for release in February 2013, its visual effects house went bankrupt and its studio, Legendary Pictures, parted ways with distributor Warner Bros. The film that's finally stumbling into cinemas almost two full years later (courtesy of Universal Pictures) should be an unmitigated disaster. Surprisingly, it's not. The film isn't exactly great, but it's a largely entertaining romp that's more inspired by than strictly faithful to Joseph Delaney's series of bestselling books.Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) is the seventh son of a seventh son: a rare genetic lineage that sets him on the path to becoming a Spook a.k.a., a slayer of the myriad evil creatures that haunt the land. He becomes the apprentice of grizzled, alcohol-addled John Gregory (Jeff Bridges), shortly after Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), an evil witch, escapes her earthly prison to claim the world as her own. With only a week to go before the blood moon rises, Tom trains with Gregory but finds himself distracted by the charms of Alice (Alicia Vikander) – a mysterious young lady with a few secrets of her own.While hardly groundbreaking in any way, the story unfolds with unexpected punch. Tom's story – one in which he comes of age and comes into his own – is accompanied by plenty of action sequences, courtesy of bone-crunching battles between men and other men (and women) who turn into soaring, swooping, fire-breathing dragons. Tom tumbles over a cliff to avoid a pursuing monster, Gregory battles a gigantic bear, and wraiths of smoke and despair trail after the Spook and his apprentice as they make their way through a dark, brooding forest.It helps, too, that the film is leavened by a welcome bite of humour. Seventh Son doesn't take itself as deadly seriously as some of its brethren in the fantasy genre do. That's why Gregory plunges into a bar brawl armed with nothing more than his flagon of beer, and Tom is allowed to make quite a few cutting remarks about his purported mentor that are heartily returned with interest.Ardent fans of Delaney's books should be warned: Seventh Son riffs on elements of the novels rather than staying strictly true to them. For one thing, Tom is considerably older in the film. Most noticeably, Malkin is a very different character than she is on the page. She's given more depth and complexity here, her vile behaviour explained, if not strictly justified by, her past entanglements with Gregory. It's actually quite nice to see a fantasy world that doesn't simply perpetuate the trope of the wicked witch, but instead dreams up characters that fall along a broad spectrum of morality.Barnes is well-cast as Tom, holding his own as both a hero and quasi-romantic lead. He shares a sweet, though not particularly electric, chemistry with Vikander who is, thankfully, called upon to do more than simper and flirt. But there are considerably more thrills to be had with Bridges, who manages to fold charm, menace and darkness into Gregory; and Moore, who's clearly having plenty of fun cutting her way through scenes as a whirlwind of madness and malevolence.By all accounts, Seventh Son should really have been an outright flop. It may still play as such to any fantasy aficionados who are demanding greatness on the level of The Lord Of The Rings. But, for pretty much everyone else, Seventh Son is an entertaining, undemanding film with some good ideas and a lot of fun moments. It's not a particularly great example of its genre but, given its troubled production history, that it's not completely execrable is probably nothing short of a miracle.",Seventh Son

57,CleveMan66,"""Seventh Son"" has great sights and sounds, but lacks significance.",5,9 February 2015,"In the folklore of various western peoples (whose ancestors often assigned the number 7 magical or spiritual significance), a seventh son of a seventh son is born with or given special powers or abilities. Depending on the folklore of the nation in question, this man may be a healer (in Ireland), a seer (in the United States) or even a werewolf (in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America). The idea of someone with such an unusual birth order and family heritage has appeared in popular culture (especially in the U.S.) in popular music, television and radio programs and literature in many different contexts. One 21st Century literary incarnation of a very special male who is a seventh son of a seventh son comes from British author Joseph Delaney who has published 16 books in his series ""The Wardstone Chronicles"" (called ""The Last Apprentice"" in the U.S.). The first of those novels, ""The Spook's Apprentice"" (or, ""The Last Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch""), is the basis for the film ""Seventh Son"" (PG-13, 1:42). I haven't read any of the books, so I can only hope that they're more engaging than the movie.Jeff Bridges plays John Gregory, the last of a series of skilled and brave knights called Spooks. The Spook's job is to protect the countryside of what looks like medieval Europe from evil spirits. These spirits can be ghosts, ghasts (a sort of semi-ghost), witches or their minions. Like all evil spirits, these beings often appear in human form, but can also shape-shift or transform into other forms like giant bears, ogres or flying dragons. As Master Gregory tells his newest apprentice, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), ""You live in a world now where legend and nightmare are real."" Tom is a seventh son of a seventh son (as all aspiring Spooks must be) who sees visions of his future, a future which includes John Gregory. Tom's visions start to become real when Master Gregory shows up at the home of Ben's family and offers Ben's father a lot of money to allow Ben to be a Spook apprentice. Believing it is his destiny, Tom gladly goes along, but Master Gregory soon doubts that Tom is up to the task and Tom also begins to doubt whether he can or even wants to be a Spook. It seems that Tom isn't all that keen to kill witches, especially when some of them are as pretty as Alice Deane (Alicia Vikander), an accused witch whom he saves from being burned by the local villagers when he recognizes her from his visions. Alice is a witch, but not an evil witch. It seems in this story that most of the characters are part one thing and part another.One character, however, who is all one thing, is Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore). She's all evil witch. She has recently escaped from her confinement in a remote hillside prison where Master Gregory had banished her years before. Her reemergence is a threat to all and she's going to become virtually unstoppable if she is not killed before the once-in-a-century ""blood moon"" becomes a full moon. Mother Malkin has just killed Master Gregory's previous apprentice (after ten years of training), which gives the old Spook less than a week to train Tom to help him defeat Mother Malkin and the witches helping her. He works hard and he's not afraid of the danger, but he's conflicted over the violent nature of the job and his growing romantic feelings toward Alice.As long as this plot summary is already, there's much more to tell, but little that I dare mention for fear of spoiling the long string of surprises that are in store for this movie's audience. I will, however, share a few choice quotes from the script's dialog, which is one of the strongest points of the movie.""You don't die easy, do you?"" ""You are a slave to darkness, not its queen."" ""Empty your heart of grief. Fill it with courage."" ""Wrong question. Wrong questions get wrong answers."" ""You were a worthy enemy, now honored and welcomed. Now we are together."" ""Seventh Son"" has a number of memorable lines, along with other strengths, but a strong story is, unfortunately, not one of them. Besides the very quotable dialog, I was impressed with the movie's visuals, to include the cinematography, the set decoration, the costumes and the special effects. The acting, on the other hand, isn't very strong. Bridges makes a decent old master, but his exaggerated line readings which make him sound older than he is were a bit distracting. I also don't think Moore came across as evil enough or Barnes as tough enough to make all this believable. And then there's the story, around which all this is built. Without any real sense of time or place, and lacking in overall big picture significance, the story just kind of drifts and leaves the audience asking, ""So what?"" This is a film which entertains the eye and tickles the ear, but doesn't do all that much for the mind or the heart. ""B-"".",Seventh Son

60,blrnani,I was tempted to give it 4,5,1 April 2018,"... out of frustration at the missed opportunity.
The biggest complaint has to be laid at the feet of Jeff Bridges, with his ridiculous pseudo English twit accent. I don't know where that came from, but perhaps he thought anybody called Master Geoffrey must have been an English twit, but even then he only manages a caricature. And this has become an annoying habit of a once good actor with a reputable legacy, as shown in RIPD and True Grit - you can't play The Big Labowski in every role!
He isn't helped by his character's bipolar disorder either. The film opens weirdly, with apprentice Kit Harrison calling him to answer the ringing bell summons. But instead of saying ""I'll just finish my drink and then we'll be off"", he pointblank refuses, prompting a local bully to demand he do his duty. That leads to a fight, the sole purpose of which is to demonstrate our hero's ability to defend himself with no more than a tankard. The bully vanquished, he then pours his unspilled drink over him, then leaves the tavern, chastizing his apprentice for not warning him the bells were calling out.
It could have been senility, or his repeatedly confirmed alcohol dependence, or depression at being the only survivor of a noble order of 1,000 knights, but we learn, as Bridges takes us on the rollercoaster ride of his character's emotions, that he was once in love with the evil villain, but married someone else and then betrayed her again after she murdered his wife in a fit of jealousy. 
This is clearly a couple to keep one's distance from, were it not for the fact that she plans to conquer the world and rid it of humans. He has an equally fanatical devotion to ridding it of witches, so something's gotta give!
Therein lies the interesting promise of the film (beyond the talented cast). At heart it should be an Arthurian quest to rid the world of evil, but that noble quest has been subverted into a 'racial' battle. But then a love story arises to rebalance everything, since Barnes and Vikander both have witch mothers who married humans out of love (tho' he doesn't know that at the beginning, despite the clues).
Julianne Moore plays a convincing villain (which may well have won her the Kingsman 2 role she played so well). We're not quite sure whether her turning to the dark side was prompted by her betrayal by Bridges or he turned against her after she showed she was turning, but by the time we meet her she's fully committed and relishing it, to a degree that even her sister (Vikander's mother) finds disturbing.
She brings lots of allies to her cause, which provides some very effective SFX, as they can all change between human and animal. Indeed one wonders how the humans can possible survive and mystified at the end as to how they actually won. It comes as a shock to see Moore, having murdered her beloved sister - because she stopped her murdering Vikander (who opted for her new love's cause) - meekly turn away and hide in a corner, despite the blood moon being at its height and supposed to make her supreme. It surely can't be the loss of the amulet, since she was pretty awesome even before she got it back.
Maybe it was sadness that Bridges preferred to die than rule the dark side next to her. He confesses ""I love you once"", she appeals to his mercy, but none is forthcoming and so she threatens to haunt him - so the feud can go on and we can get sequels.
The lovers also decide to go their separate ways but will surely meet again, another hint at a sequel. Indeed the abundance of sequel hints also becomes annoying. Arny only needed to say ""I'll be back"", but this one has no right to feel that confident - especially if Bridges insists on hanging onto that stupid accent!",Seventh Son

Asia noticeably has an earlier release date. The question now is ""Is it worth the wait?"" For a movie delayed this long, people have already forgotten about it so I won't be surprised if it flops at box office. This gets as generic as what a fantasy period film can be. It is packed with every cliché you find in the genre however it is still entertaining with its action set pieces, decent CGI and 3D.The story: Jeff Bridges plays a gruff Master Gregory who has lost his apprentice (Kit Harington) during a fight with a powerful witch (Julianne Moore). Thomas Ward (Ben Barnes) is chosen to be Gregory's new apprentice. And there you go, an action-packed adventure with perilous monsters and witches lurking. Nothing in the movie surprises, even the twists have been seen before. There are a few set pieces including a full-blown climax that use extensive CGI. Although entertaining to watch, they are lacking in the creativity department. Acting wise is alright. Music is generic but does elevate a sense of peril during the action.3D: It is surprisingly decent. I thought it would be another sloppy post-converted 3D movie that barely has depth. The 3D effects work the most during the CGI set pieces with monsters chomping right at your face. It has a reasonable amount of depth between characters and the background. Overall: Is it worth to watch it in cinema? Only if you are interested in young adult adaptations. If you don't, you are not missing much. It has all the clichés what a fantasy period movie has and does not break any new ground. Is it worth the wait? Probably not.

This movie failed at doing well what other films of this genre succeed in doing. Firstly with the performances; from the so visibly fake and distracting accent of Jeff Bridges to the bland and almost lifeless performance by Ben Barnes this movie succeeds in not making you care about anyone, not even Julianne Moore could save this movie. It is not entirely their fault for the dialogue in this film feels very forced and unnatural most of the time, and the plot is nothing amazing. This has a plot that isn't anything you haven't seen before involving a master training a student to defeat some form of evil, complete with tonnes of plot holes that It just expects you to forget about. The creativity was missing, even the love story was just thrown in there because everyone knows you need a love story to try to lighten the mood........ Right? The comedy was completely missing, whatever jokes Jeff Bridges tried did not work as this film took itself way too seriously most of the time, and there was no fun. Some of the action scenes were able to keep me awake and visually for the most part was well done, nothing too spectacular there either. In the end this film fails to capture what an action fantasy film should. The plot was boring and the characters were all forgettable, so much so that the action and somewhat interesting world couldn't do much to lift this score.

64,michaelhirakida,"Outstanding 3D, Music and Visuals, but that's it.",4,6 February 2015,"Seventh Son was a film I have heard about but it took forever to come out. When I saw the trailer, I was amazed that this fantasy flick might be great fun. Unfortunately, the film fails to live up to expectations.The film follows Thomas Ward who is chosen by Master Gregory as the newest Seventh Son to train him to kill witches before all hell is unleashed when the blood moon arrives. That's about it. There is a romance between a witch and the main character but that's not interesting.The first thing I don't like is that the movie is way to fast paced. The movie flies by so fast that you think you were only watching half an hour. That is not good because it takes only 7 minutes of set up and an hour and a half more of fighting, romance and boring stuff.Jeff Bridge's Gregory is an unlikable douche who even after he has his moments of trying to be likable, he still seems like a douche! From his idiotic grumbling which makes everything that comes out of his mouth nearly almost impossible to hear to everything else about this character is just bad.Julianne Moore's witch character really isn't interesting and I didn't care for her, but I did like Ben Barnes as Thomas who does have potential to star in better films since his performance in this was not that bad.Now let me talk about the positives. If the negatives are bad, then the positives are amazing. The 3D is some of the best I have seen in a very long time and it helps that the visuals of the film are very breathtaking. Marco Beltrami's music for the film is also outstanding and helps trying to keep the epic tone of the film that is nowhere in sight.It's disappointing because this fantasy could have been so much better. But in the end, it feels rushed and you can see the troubled production as the film was delayed a hundred times. I would just get a 3D blu ray player and this movie just for the 3D and maybe the music as well. But otherwise, it's not good.49/100 C-",Seventh Son
65,rprince-832-6294,Cliché as a film can be,5,27 February 2015,"-Seventh Son (2015) movie review: -Seventh Son is a fantasy/adventure film about the last man in an order of knights that were basically medieval Ghostbusters. He takes on a new, young apprentice who is destined for greatness and blah blah blah prophecy, blah blah blah training, blah blah blah evil threat, blah blah blah fulfil his destiny type of thing.-The entire film is like a cliché video game complete with boss battles, side-quests, and gaining new equipment. It was not bad, but not good or anything new.-The story is cliché and predictable as pretty much anything. I knew exactly how it would go down throughout the entire film.-The pace is somewhat inconsistent, with a few parts that rush and a few parts that drag.-The acting is fine. Jeff Bridges did his best imitation of himself from True Grit, which was only so-so believable. Ben Barnes did his best impression of himself as Prince Caspian, minus the accent. So he was convincing at least. Julianna Moore is the villain, and she was the best one in it.-The characters are all cliché and offered nothing new.-The music. I'm going to go back to this one.-The CGI was not as bad as the trailer, but not great. The originality the film offered in the villains was not terrible either. They just played Dark Souls and said ""Hey! Let's use all of the villains!"" -There are some scenes that are pretty witty, and some others that are pretty entertaining. So it was enjoyable to an extent.-So my least favorite thing about the film was the music. Right off the bat I noticed. Here is what happened: They were done with the editing and somebody said ""Oh guys! We forgot music!"" and another guy answered, ""Oh crap! It's okay, just use music from Game of Thrones, Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans, and Robin Hood! Problem solved!"" Oh my gosh I knew every song that played. And they picked two of my favorite soundtracks to use! So totally took me out of the moment. All of the moments. All of them.-Anyway, Seventh Son is nothing new and has some elements, like the freaking music, that make it not good. However it has some entertainment value to it, so really, if you don't care about predictability and music, Seventh Son would actually be worth watching on Nexflix.-It is PG-13 for some light violence, scary-ish images, dealings with things like sorcery, and a random F-word. Because that existed?",Seventh Son

The first trailer was interesting and entertaining. The second one was about just as good as the first one but the movie kinda disappointed me. Seventh Son has a lot of potential, the special effects are good, the action scenes are interesting, and the cast is amazing but something doesn't gel. There's something wrong the movie could have been better and it might be the writing or the directing . I didn't really care about the characters, I did not once I worried or cared about any of them dying.The rhythm was also off, there wasn't really a built up, there were no stakes and I was hardly captivated.

68,vistheindian,Bloated with below average,4,2 March 2015,"Quickie Review:In a world terrorized by witches and other hideous creatures, a Spook called Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) is the only remaining protector of humanity. With Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) gaining strength, Master Gregory takes on Thomas (Ben Barnes) as his apprentice to rid of this threat once and for all. That synopsis is more exciting than the movie itself. Seventh Son lacks quality in all facets of filmmaking. Poor acting, directing, and CGI set pieces culminate to a movie that makes watching it a challenge. Simply skip this one.Full Review:The first trailers for Seventh Son made the movie seem like a mediocre fantasy flick. Even with my managed expectations where I just wanted some fun dragon fights, I was bored.Before I fully delve into the negatives I will mention the one thing I like about the movie. Seventh Son has a significant number of creatures. I liked seeing overall variation in the design of the creatures. Apart from that, I really can't say anything else that was at least satisfactory.Actually, I'm going to backtrack a little with the one positive I mentioned. Yes individually the creature design is nice, but they are usually showcased in a large CGI set piece. During these scenes so many effects are added that it starts to feel over-congested. These are supposed to be the most exciting parts, but with such a bloated mix of CGI on screen I started to care less and less. Then there is the story, which as generic as it gets. You know every beat of the movie. Now generic stories can still be enjoyable if at least the characters are interesting. Instead all the characters feel like cartoons because everyone overacted. Yes, that's right, including Julianne Moore, who just won an Oscar for Best Actress. So I don't blame the actors for this, it was clearly the director's choice.Look I'll end this review now, because I might forget this movie even existed any minute now. It was not so bad that I wanted to gouge my eyes out. Yet the movie is so filled with below par filmmaking that it is bland and barely tolerable.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Seventh Son
69,movieswithgreg,But Bridges' accent!,6,7 June 2020,"I tried, but I can't get past Bridges' muddy, goofy, mush-mouthed, cartoonish accent. It was a measured creative decision, I'm sure. His acting is good enough, but the role could easily have been played by a dozen actors as well or better, and who had much better more believable accent that doesn't constantly distract me as a viewer. Otherwise, the sets and effects are fun, interesting, creative, thoughtful. The moods are well set. You can tell this was based on novels, since it's above-average world-making in depth and details.Television's modern-day ""Witcher"" series chases a similar narrative, but less richly, and with apparently much lower budgets.",Seventh Son
70,Man99204,Overwhelmed by Special Effects,3,28 August 2016,"This could have been an amazing movie - if they had focused on the relationships between the different characters. Instead, the special effects overwhelm this film. This ultimately becomes not a story, but an exercise in special effects. Without some sort of emotional core the film falls flat.Jeff Bridges character is also the other major problem with this film. Bridges is a supremely talented and reliable actor - not any of that is evident in this film. He hams his way through every scene. He is more mannered and artificial than Vincent Price at his worst. Scene which should have been powerful and heroic are merely laughable when Bridges is in them.",Seventh Son
71,cattjones,Writers...... really?,3,6 February 2015,"I am going to start out by saying that this was not a bad film. It is a very familiar story and there are no surprises to be had. I really enjoyed myself watching this film, but probably not for the reasons you would think. There were so many cliché lines in this film that people in the audience were saying the actors' lines (very loudly) before the actors did. This, of course had everyone in the theater cracking up. The writing for this film was terrible. Meryl Streep herself could not have saved this dialog. The one saving grace was that I saw this film in 3D and I have to tell you that this film has some of the best CGI that I have ever seen. So if you want to get your money's worth that is the way you should see it. The film is about a wicked witch that escapes from captivity and is determined to cause havoc and get revenge on the person that put her there. Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) summons all her minions to help her reek destruction and make Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) pay for what he has done to her. Along the way Master Gregory must train a new apprentice Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) to help him defeat the powers of evil. I really don't need to tell you much more., you know how the story goes. Back to the CGI. The transformation of Mother Malkin and her cast of evil doers; Radu (Djimon Hounsou), Inquisitor (Gerard Plunkett), Urag (Jason Scott Lee) Sarikin (Kandyse McClure) and Strix (Luc Roderique) was amazing. The landscape scenes and actions scenes were not too shabby either. I was truly amazed. I do have to say that I did have a difficult time wrapping my head around the fact that Jeff Bridges was playing a bad-ass ninja warrior type. I know that his body double got a real workout (LOL). Although the script was in the tanker, I could see how the actors would find this film enjoyable to make. It definitely took most of them out of their comfort zone. So to wrap things up I'm going to give the screenwriters a D and the CGI department and A+.",Seventh Son
72,ahegde3149,Simply awful fantasy adventure,2,1 July 2015,"Fantasy is one of my favorite genres. Recently the best we have been getting in fantasy is sadly The Hobbit series which unfortunately is not even remotely close to the epic feel of TLOTR series. Dracula Untold was an interesting outing but unfortunately it had its own flaws. Seventh Son is not only a poor fantasy film but its simply an awful film. I had not expected some great story but this film fails to entertain even with its visual dazzle. Actually I found the CGI and action pretty weak. The dragon like creatures, man with 4 hands and what not all looked so fake. Even the production and set design felt so cheap and B-grade. The story simply tries join the dots of the various action sequences and entirely predictable. There are quite many characters here and script rather focuses on filler action than the proper development of the characters. The strong cast with likes of Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges, Alicia Vikander, etc. all wasted. Kit Harrington aka Jon Snow is also there but his character is killed off in 5 minutes. Wish he had played the lead instead of the blank Ben Barnes The pacing is pathetically rushed and editing is terrible. All in all it was ridiculously bad. It had lot of fantasy elements to which could have utilized considering the source material but it fails miserably. Clichéd, boring, ridiculous, poorly acted,edited and written.

80,russellingreviews,A forgettable fantasy - Merely dust on the fingers,3,4 March 2015,"'When darkness falls, the son will rise'Walking into the cinema...You would think that this could be a winner with two Academy Award winners in lead roles. The fantasy genre can be a hit or miss for audiences, especially when sourced from obscure material. Going in to the cinema, there are not many expectations. Overall rating: 2 stars Cinematic rating: 2 stars Family value: 2 starsThomas Ward (Ben Barnes) has been chosen. Tom is destined for greatness in the fantasy world of The County. A role that will take him beyond his farm upbringing. In the film adaptation of Joseph Delany's, The Wardstone Chronicles, Thomas Ward is the seventh son of a seventh son and is chosen by the local 'spook', John Gregory (Jeff Bridges), to fight off the multitude of dark characters that inhabit their world, such as witches, boggarts, and ghouls. Gregory recruits his new apprentice because he is the last of a band of warriors that can fight against the rise of a queen witch, Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore). As the newest apprentice to Gregory, Thomas must learn quickly to overcome his own fears and lack of trust in his new mentor. He has to come to terms with the realities of a world that he thought was merely mythology. Coming to grips with his new found gifts and the burgeoning love of a young witch named Alice (Alicia Vikander). People who work with copy machines know the effect of making multiple copies of an original, the quality diminishes with each copy. In the search for the next fantasy cinematic adventure, Seventh Son has the feel of the attempted copy of The Lord of the Rings, Snow White and the Huntsman and even to a lesser degree, a humourless, medieval Ghostbusters. The recruitment of Academy Award winning actors, Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore, brings hope for this fantasy tale. Considering Bridges and Moore battling it out on the big screen has massive appeal. Unfortunately, their talent is wasted on an unoriginal story line. Bridges is a commanding force on the screen, but he needs to move pass the mumbling delivery of his lines. Many times his dialogue was not discernible, but this is a minor issue on the grand scale of Seventh Son. Great actors must have a strong supporting cast to give a depth to the dialogue and develop the strength of the lead characters. Interestingly enough, Bridges and Moore are supposed to be supporting characters. Ben Barnes plays the lead character in this film, but he seems to suffer from a supporting actor trapped in a leading man's body. He does not have the charisma or masculine presence to match Bridges. Also, as a romantic lead, Ben lacks any chemistry with the beautiful witch, Alice. The only chemistry that occurs between the couple is a blue spark, but it is not convincing. The weakness of characters and story development by Director Sergey Bodrov fail this tale. He does manage to provide beautiful scenery for the backdrop of the story and the CGI is admirable, but these elements fail to capture the imagination of the audience. Like the 'blue spark' between the lead characters, this story is merely dust on the fingers and there is no love lost on the audience. Seventh Son does open the door to some deeper considerations. The key element is the comparison between Thomas Ward and King David of the Bible. Not that Joseph Delany acknowledges the Bible as an influence, the comparisons are uncanny. Thomas is the the youngest son chosen by a 'prophet' to go forward to battle an insurmountable evil. Thomas does not realise his potential until chosen by the elder. Comparisons can be made to his strengths and weakness, primarily that his main weakness would be a woman. Yet, in the end he represents the saviour for the world. Not to press the analogy too far, but even in the weak storyline of Seventh Son, the messianic message permeates narrative on the screen. Leaving the cinema... Throughout the film, there were sighs from the audience of 'been here before.' Walking out of the theatre, it was a quiet walk to the lobby. Amongst friends, we tried to find positive points from this fantasy adventure, but it was difficult. When cinematography is the only consistent positive note, it does not bode well for the screening. Overall it was not too offensive or over the top for fantasy violence, but it might be worth waiting until it comes out on DVD.

81,210west,"Despite the lousy reviews, pretty damned charming",8,30 May 2015,"I've just watched this, on the same day I saw the new ""Mad Max"" (in 3-D, no less), and I have to say that, despite the almost universally dismissive reviews you'll find online, I found ""Seventh Son"" ten times more enjoyable than the empty and overheated ""Max."" And also -- thanks to its engaging characters -- considerably more suspenseful.Why were the critics so hard on it? Frankly, I'm mystified. I mean, it's basically just a fairy tale, a medieval fantasy with all the necessary trappings, and (unlike most fairy tales on-screen) it never becomes treacly and insipid. It's got lots of action, lots of over-the-top fights, and lots of CGI dragons flying around - and I guess I must have a greater than average fondness for CGI dragons, because I thought they looked great.It's worth noting, too, that Alicia Vikander is actually more appealing here than she was in ""Ex Machina"" (a film whose critical reception was equally mysterious, albeit in this case too kind). In the ingenue role, she's rather adorable. So are Olivia Williams and Antje Traue, playing surprisingly similar mothers. I think I've fallen in love with them both.Speaking of Olivia Williams, I want to quote something that amused me from Richard Roeper's review (available on Rotten Tomatoes). It's a negative review -- practically all of them are -- but he makes a good point: ""Ben Barnes (who plays Tom) is 33. He looks 33. Isn't the kid in the books like 12? ... And if Tom is the seventh son of a seventh son, some of his brothers must be 50. And yet Mam is a hot 45ish.

We will see some magic, bad guys transforming back and forth into frightening animal shapes at will. But what is most outstanding is the CGI as it is truly impressive. The fight scenes are very good and don't last forever. The acting all around is good, but listening to Jeff Bridges sound too much like a much older man was sometimes annoying; and sometimes he was difficult to understand. Ben Barnes is a newcomer and did very well and we shall see more of him in future movies, I am sure. His character falls in love with Alice (Alicia Vikander) who it turns out is also a witch, but a good one and pretty too, so that's a break. The whole movie is dedicated to the death of Mother Malkin before she conquers the entire world. So it's CGI action, action, and action throughout with magic, magic, magic thrown in.

It represents a small universe of Lord of the Ring, combining the elements of Outlander and Season of the Witch, but ends up just like the latter two, letting down by an uninspiring and predictable plot limited by low budget, poor performance from the young cast, unexciting action scenes, underwhelming scores and awful dialogues.

Unfortunately the things that bring it down 2 points from a possible 10 score are why some reviewers could not get into this movie.Going in initially there was probably too much expectation for most viewers who will want to see something new, as this story based on the books ""The spooks"" by writer Joseph Delaney has been adapted for films before so feels like a remake.That being said I really enjoy all these movies when done well like Seventh Son, plus I also love reading so my advice to people who enjoyed the film as I did is to not despair & instead of hoping for an unlikely sequel go read all the books.In my experience 99.9% of books are much better than movies made from them, so if each day you have a bit of free time spend some time reading a good book.Films can be a great shared experience, but books can be more magical as well.",Seventh Son

87,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Seventh Son Review,5,5 February 2015,"My Thoughts:This is your standard February movie, meaning that if it was placed in the blockbuster block it would definitely be a bomb. I still do not think that it was a great movie or even a good movie at its best Seventh Son is an okay movie.A running theme with some of the past movies I have reviewed is that the special effects and action scenes worked really well and looked good but the writing and even some of the acting just falls so short in the movie that you are going really?! i say this because we are getting these I will start calling them the Winter Block movies that have these big named actors that you know can act but seem stuck with either how the director or the writers lock them in.Take Jeff Bridges, we all know this man can act but it seems when he got chosen for this character he went ""oh I know the perfect character for this guy"" and dusted off Roy from R.I.P.D (see our review here). Though Jeff Bridges does have a bar fight scene that I thought was really well done and was fun to watch. But that is what you get from most of the cast through this movie, you will get these flashes of good acting but then they seem to get sucked back into the abyss and continue on with what they were given us before. Oh and if you are looking for a big performance from Jon Snow aka Kit Harington you will be disappointed. I was hoping that we would get to see him redeem his big screen acting chops and make us forget that crap of a movie Pompeii (review) he gave us the year before.This is a pretty standard by the numbers fantasy movie with nothing really new to offer the audience. You have a knight who belongs to an order that back in its heyday was a great and respected group but now is barely respected. Darkness has returned to the land and it is up to this Knight along with his new apprentice that he has to train in the time it takes to journey to where the darkness is gathering. We get that whole the bad guys have to wait until a certain time to gain ultimate power so they can take over the world but throughout the movie you see them beating up and taking on Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) and his Apprentice Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) when they could have pretty much killed them at anytime. They also take on and destroy a whole city, I mean what more are you waiting for if you already have that kind of power before your ceremony that is going to give you greater power? I get this is a movie and it would be over quickly if they did this but then do not put them in situations that they are facing off against these enemies and you are showing us that they are more powerful then the good guys and could easily defeat them at will but don't for some strange reason.I am trying to think of some good points that I can make about this movie that I haven't already commented on but it is difficult. The cinematography I thought was pretty good over all. Some of the actions scenes are really well done as well. Story/Plot fails in its execution. Acting just seems like most of them phoned it in or where not allowed to let their acting chops fly. My Recommendation:You know I was on the fence with what I was going to recommend for this movie but the more I wrote up my review the more I came to realize I could not tell you guys to go pay money for this at the theaters. So my recommendation is to Rent It.",Seventh Son
88,InMyHonestOpinion,A tale as old as time with nothing new to add but a whole lot of CGI,4,17 March 2015,"Fantasy adventure films have always had their place amongst the realm of cinema, when I was young I loved fantasy adventure, films like: Conan, Krull, Beast Master and alike. These days though I feel as though everything that gets released in the genre are recreations of plots done to death and were done much better, sure the special effects in the 70's and 80's were nothing compared to what they are today but that's what made those films so great, those little special effects. These days CGI is king and a lot of the time is so over used that it leaves nothing for our imaginations to grasp hold of. Seventh Son is the story of Gregory the spook (one who hunts the supernatural) and his mission to destroy the Queen of the witches Mother Malkin set in the 18 century. After trapping Malkin years pass by and she remains in prison until the threat of a new blood moon looms, Malkin escapes her prison and takes off to cause havoc and reclaim her kingdom once more. Gregory and his newest apprentice Ben; the seventh son of a seventh son set about the task of stopping Malkin and protecting the world from the devastation she plans to bring Sound familiar??? It's a story that has been told time and time again, set in all ages and in all places but especially medieval times where this is set once again. The stand out for the film and the reason you should see it though is for Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, True Grit) who plays Mater Gregory, he has created a fantastic character in Gregory, everything from his voice to his movements is exciting to hear and see. Also helping the film out is Julianne Moore (Still Alice, Mockingjay pt 1) who plays Mother Malkin, she manages to bring an over the top possibility down to Earth and even a little humble, she has done a marvelous job with her character and even though she is the ""bad guy"" you can't help but root for her in some places, and that's about all the goodness the film has to offer. The other characters are annoying, the actors should be on an Australian soap opera, they were lifeless, plain and boring, they brought nothing to the screen but a presence, and I hate to say it; but I doubt if the actors were even replaced with A list celebrities their characters would have been any different. I feel all the effort was put into Jeff and Julianne and the CGI landscape and beasties. Ben Barnes (Chronicles of Narnia, Stardust) plays the son of the seventh son Tom Ward, Alicia Vikander (Anna Karenina, A Royal Affair) plays Alice, Olivia Williams (The Sixth Scent, Rushmore) plays Mam who does bring a little something more to her character at least. This is Sergey Bodrov's first real English film he is really well known for his Russian films so I did expect a lot more from him, I have a feeling that perhaps the actors may have directed themselves in places as he sat back and took it all in. I was disappointed as I definitely expected more from the director of ""Mongol"" and ""Nomad"". The CGI used was so extensive at times there was so much happening on the screen it was hard to make heads or tails of what was taking place, don't get me wrong it was great, the dragon scenes in particular were legendary it was just a little messy is all. It seems to be CGI has taken over a lot of the substance a film can deliver when cheap thrills and special effects are used. Seventh Son isn't worth rushing out to see, it is worth waiting to see on DVD at least but I wouldn't be wasting my money at the cinemas. Being a fantasy adventure its appropriate for kids with only a few swears nothing they wouldn't hear in the school yard on a daily basis anyway.",Seventh Son

90,kangarooconnor,JUST MAKE THE BOOKS,1,29 October 2018,"I, as in being a giant GIANT fan of the books having read all of them and the sequel series say how dare they take a good spookish book with character more than one dimensional and villains with actual tenacity to them to this holy heap of garbage film.There are many thing in this movie like the book, Alice does fall in love with tom, toms mother is a good witch and dies die, there aren't a lot of spooks, and mother mankins wish to kill everyone.
HERES EVERYTHING WORNG WITH IT: first of toms mother isn't killed by mother malkin she's killed by and old god in the 6 book and is the queen of the lamaia witches (species in book not going into specifics scales of dirt women with black wings) and half the people mother malkin enlist in her ""ARMY"" aren't in the book, tusk the big dude who works for master Gregory doesn't, he is a villain brut that dies in the first book and works for Bonnie lizzy, oh never heard of Bonnie lizzy WELL THATS CAUSE SHES BARELY IN THE MOVIE. Bonnie lizzy is Alice's mother who helps revive her, Bonnie lizzy is more of a threat in the books and shows up more, she's in this movie getting her face fixed that's it then she dies.
THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE I LIKE, ACTUALLY I LOVE IS: Jeff bridges as master Gregory, has the same build, facial hair, age, attitude, sarcasm, and everything Jeff bridges was perfect and that's the only thing I liked about this movie it sucked wasn't like the books not 1%NOW BEFORE YOU GET ON ME I know that not all movie are like/ good as movies but at least when others have made an adaptation the try to stick to the books likeness a bit this movie took the names and same ideas and changed it to what the wanted and that's it.1/10 was horrible do not watch!!!!!!",Seventh Son

This time: Joseph Delaney's The Spook's Apprentice!John Gregory, who is a seventh son of a seventh son and also the local spook, has protected his country from witches, boggarts, ghouls and all manner of things that go bump in the night. However John is not young anymore, and has been seeking an apprentice to carry on his trade. Most have failed to survive. The last hope is a young farmer's son named Thomas Ward. Will he survive the training to become the spook that so many others couldn't? Should he trust the girl with pointy shoes? How can Thomas stand a chance against Mother Malkin, the most dangerous witch in the county?So, this movie is really good. The storyline is really good and interesting. Actually, I got what I was expecting. Usually, I don't watch fantasy movies, but when I saw the trailer for this movie, I got excited. Acting in this movie is nothing special, but it's not bad. The action scenes are cool and exciting, but some of jump effects of enemies are really unnatural and funny, but in this case, effects are good. The last battle in this movie is really cool and after I watched it, I was going back to again to beginning.There is actually not much soundtrack which I don't like. Clichés in this movie are really often, which I don't like.I recommend this fantasy movie to everybody who likes action and, of course, fantasy.",Seventh Son
93,rajivness,boooooring!!!! Avoid at all Costs!!,3,23 February 2015,"with all the hype this movie got - i was expecting something awesome.This movie provides nothing new to the fantasy genre. in fact its a mashup of several movies before it like Dungeons and Dragons, Dragonheart, Dragon Slayer, Eragon - for the dragon stuff; Conan the barbarian, Stardust, etc, for transformation stuff. In fact Conan the barbarian (or conan the destroyer) was the first movie way back when (in the 1980s) to show a warlock transform into a dragon of mist/smoke and fly over a lake. Effects are better in this one - but same ol same ol. This movie also borrows from Sorcerer's Apprentice, Season of the Witch, Vampire's assistant, etc.This is a standard story of Good Vs Evil. The knight and his squire must single handedly defeat the Dragon queen and all her legions and cohorts. A few twists in tne movie - but they seem kind of pointless since they are not written well and the story is scattered and confused.I'd give this a pass as far as going to the cinema. If you really want to watch it - rent the DVD (for free) from your local library or from Redbox/Netflix.",Seventh Son

It's a shame because the CGI isn't bad and they've clearly spent some money on the production, but the script is terrible! They've got some decent actors involved too but it's hard when you've got a bad script. Jeff Bridges is also beyond terrible, it sounds like he is doing a bad impression of Ian McKellan/Sean Connery. A little script rewording, 20 minutes more world building and it would have been better. Sad times.",Seventh Son

96,IanAJohnson,This film was incredibly clichéd and predictable.,2,15 February 2015,"Seventh Son is a fantasy movie about an apprentice being brought up to defeat an evil witch that is terrorizing the land. Unfortunately there is not much that I can praise about this film. The action scenes are filmed rather well. There is little to no shaky cam and the choreography is fine, but the sequences are performed rather poorly most of the time. While I enjoyed a couple of sequences, most were just boring. The special effects are fine. They are not great but not bad enough to really hurt anything. The acting is quite poor. Everyone speaks in an over-dramatic and stoic way. Jeff Bridges speaks in a weird mumble similar to his Rooster Cogburn impression. Think up your most generic fantasy characters. Are you done? Good. They are all in this movie. There is no character development at all. Every generic character remains generic for the entire duration of the plot. Any of them could be killed and I wouldn't care. Certain information will arise involving these characters but this information is almost always irrelevant. The apprentice can see visions, but they are useless. There seems to be something special about being the seventh son of a seventh son, but in the end it doesn't really mean anything. It just goes on and on. This movie brings up so many topics and ideas but they all lead nowhere. Now, think of your most generic movie plot. It probably involves some prophecy, and unstoppable evil force, some old wizard with a beard and his apprentice. Don't forget the random mythical creatures, demons and ghosts (and ghasts). Chances are that the plot you just made up in your head has more originality than this film. There is even an extremely forced romance that has no emotional weight or substance at all. I love the fantasy genre. There can be so much fun to be had in it, but everything in this movie has been done so much better in other films. So much of this movie is just unbelievable. A group of top trained assassins can be taken down by a single farm boy with less than a week of training. People survive the most impossible odds constantly. People will be surprised buy things that have happened several times before. Certain plot points will only be brought up at exactly the right time to seem relevant, but in the end that information is useless and makes no sense. There is a very small underlying idea of fate and destiny but it was just tacked on like everything else. This film is a perfect example of quantity over quality. There are a ton of ideas, but none of them are fully realized.",Seventh Son
97,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,Entertaining Kill-the-Witch adventure with a love story,7,7 February 2015,"""Seventh Son"" is a classic struggle between knights and witches with a young love story and a tragic long-ago love story. It is a typical fantasy told with bits of heart and bits of drama. You will enjoy the morphing of animals into humans and the abundant battles with beasts and monsters. Perhaps there are too many repetitive yawn-inducing CG battles. Although the storyline is somewhat predictable, it has enough twists and revelations to keep the audience somewhat excited. The opening scene is fascinating: the witch being locked away by a mysterious man and then fast-forward passing-of-time in what it looks like is a Grand Canyon/Highlands hybrid landscape. During the whole movie the scenery is very enjoyable, including the medieval villages and castles. Certainly Julianne Moore impersonation as the evil shape-shifter witch is spellbinding! And then, there are the dragons--loved that too! The chosen boy to become apprentice has all these visions that foreshadow what's coming next. Along the entire movie, the visuals are dulled by a certain haze or fog--I guess that's the mood the director wants to convey for the film.The centerpiece of the story is the witch and revolving around that is the training of the seventh son. After the introduction, we then meet Gregory (Jeff Bridges). and we learn what he wants-- to kill all witches. Jeff Bridges is sort of a humorous medieval Buffalo-Bill-looking knight determined to destroy the witch--Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), and to accomplish that, he recruits the Seventh Son, the country boy, Tom (Ben Barnes). We also learn that the witch wants revenge, and she'll organize her forces to take power. When we meet Tom, the to-be-apprentice, we learn that he wants a different life and that he has a strong bond with his mother, who gives him a special pendant before he goes with the teacher (Jeff Bridges). We later discover some truths about Tom and about Gregory that give us a new insight into these characters. This pendant, and the emphasis on the mother have a reason to be--these two elements become relevant later in the story. Next appears a young witch, who will captivate Tom's heart. Overall the performances are passionless, except for the witch herself. Perhaps the story spends more time in battles than in character exploration. My favorite part of the movie is the third act: suddenly there's drama! In the end, we learn that there are good witches and bad witches, and that a change of heart is possible. This is no ""Lord of the Rings"" and is not much of a memorable movie, but it is entertaining. It's based on a fantasy novel--The Last Apprentice--the Revenge of the Witch. Actually ""Seventh Son"" reminds me of that Michelle Pfeiffer witch film: Stardust and also of the ""Chronicles of Narnia."" Certainly this is a film worth watching. I thought I wouldn't, but I'm planning to watch this movie a second time. There's something compelling about it and I want to find out what it is...Enjoy.Thanks for reading! Cheers.",Seventh Son
98,gojiseb,"Dull, uninspired waste of a solid cast.",4,8 February 2015,"Seventh Son was okay. The CGI was pretty bad, I never found myself caring about a single characters and the action scenes were uninspired. It doesn't help that the whole thing looks like it was shot with the softest focus imaginable and contains one of the most boring, contrived attempts at a love story I've ever seen. However, it has some good stuff going for it. Bad effects aside, some of the creature designs were quite nice and Jeff Bridges did manage to get a couple laughs out of me. Ben Barnes is a total vortex of charisma, though. Christ, poor guy just can't do it...Julianne Moore and Djimon Hounsou made good villains but I feel like they might have made them too sympathetic. They made the monsters into such victims that it made the heroes looking like total sadists, leaving us with no one to really root for.Overall, it's not the worst thing ever but it's definitely not something anyone needs to rush out to see.",Seventh Son
99,joelsmith190,It's surprisingly solid for a film delayed so many times,7,22 July 2015,"Seventh Son is a film adaptation of ""The Spook's Apprentice"", and while I won't pretend to have read the book, as I haven't, I feel I can still accurately judge the movie. I've been waiting to watch this movie since I saw the preview for it while watching Pacific Rim at home. Mind you, this movie should've come out two years ago, but didn't due to some licensing issues, so I assumed we'd either never see it or it would suck.One of the best things in this movie is that it has great set pieces, special effects, and music that make you feel a part of it. And while the music isn't as good as the next movie I will be reviewing, it is still really good and fits in well with the film. This and its sense of wonder are what I feel are best done in this film.The action sequences (specifically the Spook's) are well done and fast-paced, with great sense of motion and fluidity in the way the characters move and fight. Which is what I always love to see (INSERT MY USUAL HARPING FOR KINGSMAN AND EQUILIBRIUM)It has a couple of people I've seen before; Jeff Bridges from RIPD as the Spook, Kit Harington from Pompeii in a very limited role towards the beginning, and Djimon Hounsou from Pompeii and Guardians of the Galaxy in another limited role. Jeff Bridges feels like he has a ""wannabe' Sean Connery voice"" if nobody could understand Connery. The acting isn't very great, but it isn't terrible. Bridges and the main protagonist probably do the best jobs.Seventh Son's story isn't that great but it isn't one we've really seen before in the modern age. It's pretty interesting because I'd never heard of Seventh Sons before until I started researching them before watching this movie. I feel the movie is too short and has too huge of a pacing problem for a movie that was finished a couple of years ago.Dialogue is well done and humor is found throughout the film which eases some of the tension. It's always nice to see good lines and some comedy every once and awhile.While not as good as the preview made it look like it'd be, Seventh Son is a decent movie that I feel deserves a 7.5/10. It has a great sense of wonder, but I feel the pacing and mediocrity in some areas kill a lot of what could've made this a 10/10. Some more world- building and a longer run time could've fixed this problem. Anyways, I don't think this is a 3/10 or anything and I feel this movie was unfairly judged. For one of the movies I was most hyped for this year, the film disappoints a lot, but I won't say it's terrible.﻿",Seventh Son

Ben Barnes and Alicia Vikander are so beautiful looking they hurt your eyes. I was really excited when Kit Harrington was in it and didn't realise it was only a small part. So was gutted when he died early on. The things for me not giving this a higher rating are the following. Jeff Bridges voice. He is one of my favourite actors but his voice just didn't seem quite right. Julianne Moore. Again another favourite actor but not right for this part. Her clothes and appearance could have been better and she wasn't scary enough. Considering this was a main role it could have been so much more than it was. I think my favourite actor in this was Olivia Williams. Well worth a watch though and probably the last half hour is the best.,Seventh Son

102,mhol111964-754-567942,This is another one of those where the trailer is better than the film itself.,3,10 July 2015,"Let me start off by saying that have not read the novel nor even heard of it prior to hearing about this. I went into this film expecting a cheesy but fun flick. Generally speaking, I often enjoy a good corny supernatural action flick. But this was quite disappointing.Before I get to the point, let me go ahead and note that this film was originally distributed by Warner Bros. and was set for a January 17, 2014 release. But at the last minute, after releasing the teaser trailer, Warner Bros. sold the distribution rights to Universal and the release date was postponed to February 6, 2015. That is exactly an entire year plus one month. I have never ever seen that happen before. Apparently, Warner Bros. did not want to have anything to do with the project.This film has a lot of things going for it, and it looked promising from the trailers, but after watching it, I can now see why Warner Bros. didn't want to feel responsible for it. But before I go into the bad things about the film, I am going to name the good things.The Good: I like the film's style, setting and tone. I liked Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore in this. They are what you would call the ""strongest parts of the movie"". I liked Julianne Moore as the villain. The witches and wizards are cool as well as their creature transformations. It has some intense moments and I really enjoyed the third act. Unfortunately, that is all that I can say about the good.The Bad: This film is, for the most part, a snooze fest. I was literally bored out of my mind throughout the first and second act. The characters are wooden, boring and just plain uninteresting. Jeff Bridges did a pretty good job portraying his character but his character is just boring. Bridges usually makes his characters entertaining (The Dude, Flynn, Rooster Cogburn, Starman etc.), but unfortunately, this is not the case. There is not a whole lot of action and nothing exciting happens until the last 30 minutes or so. The film is also uneven. The plot is rushed, the special effects are cheap looking and the opening sequence is downright laughable. The script is very derivative to the point where it felt like I have seen it all before. The final act is basically the only part of the film that I enjoyed.Overall, Seventh Son, despite it's redeeming qualities, is a pretty poorly made film and I would not recommend it.",Seventh Son
103,vsd324,"""Seventh Son"" has everything you need for a Medieval epic tale.",5,6 August 2017,"With wizards, warlocks, witches, walled cities, demons, dragons, knights and ogres, and of course with a side of romance, ""Seventh Son"" has everything you need for a Medieval epic tale. In this movie Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) is the 7th son of a 7th son, a fate thought to hold great destiny. Tom becomes the apprentice of John Gregory (Jeff Bridges). Gregory is a ""spook"" which in this world is ironically a good guy who protects humankind from evil supernatural spirits and beings. Gregory's arch nemesis is the powerful witch Malkin (Julianne Moore), who is growing more powerful with the presence of a blood moon. Together Gregory and Tom go and a quest to stop Malkin's havoc. This movie is a film version of the novel ""The Last Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch,"" the first book of the ""Wardstone Chronicles"" by Joseph Delaney. When these types of novel series moved to the big screen, there are a large number of characters that are well developed in the book. It's hard to cram all this character development into two hours. ""Seventh Son"" had lots of interesting characters that were likely highly developed in the novel, but in the movie it feels like it moves too fast to get to know any of themand the movie is not that fast paced.

It is more about the production and the bells and whistles than anything else. This film was exactly that. Beautiful fantasy landscapes in 3D, enticing the senses with mystical cities and evil creatures.It is one of those films where you can just sit back and marvel at modern technology and the ability it has to allow viewers to slip into a surreal world where good combats evil and where the good always wins (even though we loose quite a few ""good"" folks along the way).But that is where it stops. There is no plot, it is just a fairytale with some mediocre acting and a very clumsy ending. As I am not a fan of the genre personally, I do see the appeal for some people, but I just cant really get myself to give this rather boring storyline more than a 5 out of 10. I suppose it is good if you want to go on a date or be transported into some mystical world for an hour and a half and forget the pressures of every day life.

105,dangent280,Unlucky Number Seven,3,28 March 2015,"Julianne Moore. Oscar Winner. Jeff Bridges. Oscar Winner. Kit Harrington. He knows nothing. In terms of an A-List cast, Seventh Son does pretty well, with it even having the chance to show off rising star Alicia Vikander who seems to be in absolutely everything this year, from Ex Machina to Testament of Youth alongside Jon Snow himself. Based upon the novel, The Spook's Apprentice, something of which I was unaware of before watching the film, Seventh Son tells the tale of seventh son of the seventh son Tom Ward, played by Prince Caspian's Ben Barnes, who is taken under the wing of Jeff Bridges', John Gregory, the legendary ""spook"", who is tasked with defending humanity from the dark supernatural forces around them, including Julianne Moore's Mother Malkin, the renowned evil blood- magic witch. With such a cast, and a pretty cool premise including all the mystical tropes of dragons, witches and sword-fights, Seventh Son has to be nothing short of amazing, surely? Erm. no. It really isn't.Firstly, from the kick-off, Jeff Bridges is incomprehensible. Imagine Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, mashed together with a drunk Billy Connolly and that's pretty much how Bridges has chosen to play this particular role, although, to be honest, none of what he says really matters throughout the 100 minutes run-time, with the script being unbelievably dull and the characters even more so, particularly Barne's, Tom Ward, who will take some beating to not win worst and, or, most forgettable main character in a film released this year. Truly awful. As for newly crowned ""Best Actress"", Julianne Moore, her performance as the witch/dragon/thing antagonist has made me think twice whether she was right to gain such an award earlier this year. In my opinion, Moore and ""Best Actor"", Eddie Redmaybe, both made secret pacts with Hollywood that involved both of them being given Oscars as long as they performed as bad as they could at being baddies in other films released this year. Talking of Eddie Redmayne and Jupiter Ascending, Seventh Son at least has one up on the latter by having rather enjoyable action sequences throughout, particularly in ones when the General Grievous/Kali- esque warrior is present, but Seventh Son is definitely at the level of the abomination that was Jupiter Ascending earlier this year. It's dull. It's badly CGI'd. It's a total waste of time. There was talk of Seventh Son being turned into a franchise for the future. If that franchise is going to be at this level however, don't waste your time lads and lasses. Wait for Star Wars.Overall Score: 4/10",Seventh Son

So I can't really put my finger on it, but it just felt like they got something wrong. Maybe it was just that Mr Bridges seems kinda stuck on the same character from RIPD. Don't get me wrong, I actually liked RIPD (little bit more than 7th Son,BTW )but that character did not quiet fit in on this film. The special effects were pretty cool, loved the dragons. Ben Barnes was sexy grrr... and I kept getting distracted by Ms Moore's long finger nails, so I really did not pay attention to her acting because I was waiting for her to use 'em like a weapon ..or just pock her eye out.

107,just_for_movies,A fun fantasy movie filled with clichés,7,15 February 2015,"Seventh Son exceeded my expeditions by a great deal. I had no high hopes for this movie in the first place but I thought it would at least be a cheesy, clichéd, fantasy movie that just might be good. Well, it definitely was clichéd and slightly cheesy but I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. First off, the story and plot were pretty basic. The movie certainly had its cheesy one-liners and the plot definitely was very clichéd with the typical good vs. evil and a ""nobody"" boy needs to fulfill his destiny. But other than that, the story and plot were pretty basic and didn't require much thinking. I, for one, understood what was happening for most of the time. There were moments in the movie that just happened and then weren't explained at all. Those were the moments where I was like, ""So why did that happen?"" The acting... was not that bad actually. I was particularly impressed with Ben Barnes in the lead role. Julianne Moore was a pretty good evil witch and all the other supporting actors and actresses fit surprisingly well in their roles. The real downfall though is Jeff Bridges. His acting was just kind of terrible I have to admit. His voice was the main problem, it being almost inaudible. I suppose he wanted to embrace Master Gregory's scruffy manner, but it did not really work out. Now about the actual seeing and hearing. The music was kind of that usual epic fantasy music, but none the less it fit well with the movie. Before I start on visual effects, I want to say that the color correction on this movie in the trailers looked quite ugly, but it turns out that the actual movie is just fine, especially on a big screen. Anyway, the visual effects were generally pretty good. Judging by the trailers and my own instincts, I thought they were going to be, at best, mediocre. But it turns out they were quite good. There were some moments where I thought ""Yup, they definitely used green screen for that shot"" or there were moments were the VFX themselves were just not quite finished or not good in general. But all in all, they were actually pretty good.In the end, Seventh Son is an extremely fun, cheesy adventure movie that is worth seeing in theaters. If you go in with low expectations or an open mind, you will enjoy it immensely.",Seventh Son

Great acting, great plot, great special effects, really shows the the division in ideals about witchcraft. Some think witchcraft is evil (actually most) and some think it's good, bad or a mixture of both, depends on your perspective of things. I'm a practicing witch, and I get it. Most witches are portrayed as evil and must be destroyed, as they should be. But some are good and a lot of people just don't understand us. The idea of destroying something you don't understand upsets me greatly. My focus is of balance. I tend to be in the middle. This movie focuses in the differences of the good/evil thing very well. There is a tender understanding of the differences portrayed in this movie eventually. You will shift sides throughout till you finally get it. The moral is we all need to get along, no matter our differences, and that makes it so beautiful it brings me to tears. Watch this movie. It's awesome.",Seventh Son

And under average for the genre as well. Full of stereotypes, boring if not idiotic sometimes and .... uffff I absolutely hate it when ""noobs"" get to play with big ideas or idiots get to thrash big ideas in order to recover their money.

110,hopebuild,A Decent Fantasy Movie,9,3 July 2015,"Overall I really enjoyed the movie. Granted the plot wasn't richly developed and the green screen shots contrasting to the real life Canadian outdoor shots was obvious. Sometimes I just want to be entertained and I will overlook the shortcomings of a film. Lately a lot of the movies that have came out have had so much that bothers me in the way of horrible dissolving plots, bad acting, bad casting, etc. This movie didn't have anything that insulted my intelligence, so I'm grateful for that. For me the simple plot worked. It was a decently entertaining film that I plan to watch a couple more times. I am hoping that there will be at least one sequel.",Seventh Son

Bridges and Moore will have hopefully been paid a ton of money to make this dross.I can't believe for a minute that the script interested them. I watched it whilst playing on-line and phoning my daughter. You can turn off the sound for minutes and really not miss anything. Don't pay cinema prices for this. Straight to video would have been the best it could hope for. The cinematography is OK, the costumes are hilarious and Mother Malkins' Castle has really gone downhill since she was imprisoned.

112,davemfawcett,Worth Watching for Syfy fans,8,13 February 2017,"The Good. Special effects and CGI were surprisingly good for what I was expecting. The special effects were very impressive in the way they flowed during major fight scenes, the manner they used CGI with actors in all but one scene, was near flawless. The Bad. Jeff Bridges played an odd fellow very creepy and oddly. Most of the other acting was good to very good. The story was okay, but had major issues on why the heck did they do that or this at times as it did not add to the story or made you feel, why didn't they do that sooner if they could that in the first place. In that respect, the story took several leaps to move the over all movie plot along. (Very Minor Maybe Spoiler) It also had a major pivotal plot hole without explanation on why the two major characters relationship ended if they loved each other? This was major and pivotal because it was their relationship ending that set up the the movie and why the ""Queen"" witch went all evil. The Overall. Never heard of this movie, which made the enjoyment of it greater, had I been expecting a blockbuster I would have been disappointed. However, while this is no Lord of Rings, it is very good movie to watch once and kill an hour and a half!",Seventh Son
113,Franco_Strydom,"All the white washed, generic, bored fantasy standards you can fit into a single film.",2,10 January 2015,"It's not an awful film but if you want to see something new, anything new, then this isn't the film to look at. The production quality is high; things look good. They're shot well and you can see a lot of time and effort went into creating it. But I have to ask, if you're going to put that much time and effort into a project, why not do something new/fresh/unique/original?The narrative is more predictable than a Dungeons and Dragons rulebook and when the description for a monster was presented as a ""level six monster"" I had to take a moment to ensure my jaw wasn't on my lap. The character archetypes walk straight of the pages of any explanation of the Monomyth or Three Act Play. The mentor is a grumpy old man who gets disrespected by everyone but who is 'the most incredible fighter of evil'. The hero is 'the most unlikely candidate' to past the trails of being a Spook. Yes, the greatest warriors against evil are called Spooks – sounds too much like lazy writing to ignore. They have to defeat the 'greatest evil' before the 'blood moon' is full. The most generic fantasy content and lingo.Some of the dialog was also atrocious. In a fight one character comments ""(y)ou know nothing of dragons."" This intimidating comment is either completely useless as there are no other reference to dragons and if it turns out that the flying baddies are dragons then the statement is incorrect as the person the comment was aimed at knows the one quite intimately. Another such comment was ""his reign of terror"". The him that is referred to here holds no station of power beyond the power he claims over any person he faces in single combat, hardly a reign of any kind.The representation of the antagonists was interesting, visually at least. The master assassin couldn't be bothered to do anything sneaky or stealthily. His 'army of assassins' are incorrectly introduced as, well, assassins when really they're just 'random cannon fodder for the slaughter' to fill in the fight scenes between Lieutenants; yes the bad guys (who are witches) have a queen and she has lieutenants. The hero goes through the minimal required amount of character development, just like everyone else. Everyone who has to die, dies on cue. The love interest is a shallow relationship that starts with eye contact and ends with betraying their respective parties at one point or another, with little other than a single make out session in between.I'm looking for a saving grace and I'm having trouble coming up with one. It's like drinking a glass of tap water, not bad but it's not going to tickle your taste buds.",Seventh Son
114,mc_croucher,Are You Kidding Me!!!,6,7 February 2015,While the movie had some interesting aspects I cannot even remotely say I enjoyed it for two reasons. 1) I am a reader and read seven of the Last Apprentice series. The books were amazing to me and I couldn't wait for the film when I found out that it was coming out. But Hollywood ruined it. Five minutes into the movie and I knew they changed the entire plot line. I was screaming in my head the entire movie. 2) aside for reading the books before hand and being mad that they changed everything. The storyline the gave was predictable and tried to hard to amuse. The trailer showed most of the action packed scene and the comic spots were unsatisfying. I wouldn't recommend this for two types of people: ones who have read the books or ones who saw the trailer. Nothing will satisfy you during this film. Deeply Disappointed,Seventh Son

(I say this as the film bears very little resemblance to the book and the scenery is nothing like the English landscape either). This is a perfect example of what happens when the author has no clout in Hollywood and allows a director to simply do whatever they like. Obviously Sergei Budrov thought he understood the book better than the author, so happily stuck two fingers up at the fans and made it up as he went.",Seventh Son

Does she age?The only main complaint is the character who plays the 7th son. He is like todays modern day soy boy. He's not a bit masculine, he just comes off as this semi wimpy dude at best.

Even without reading the book, I was extremely confused and bored through the entire movie. Nothing about the plot made sense. Characters have no development through the entire movie, and only little bits of background is given about the main characters and main villain, and the bit we are given makes little sense and adds no tension to the movie.Probably the part of the movie that lost me the most and made me want to turn the movie off is the romance between Tom and Alice. It happens so fast and it literally makes no sense that they would ever get together in the way that they did. The characters had little to no chemistry, and they ended up sleeping with each other on their second or third time seeing each other. Unless this is a social commentary on the current state of dating in the modern day, this was dumb and shouldn't have been included.Moral of the story, don't watch this movie. Go watch Stardust instead. That movies not amazing, but it's fairly decent and certainly a million times better than this fun-sucker of a movie.",Seventh Son

They are good movies, all of which I wish had a sequel. They may not be exactly like the books but the people who complain about that stuff are the first to tell you comic book movies aren't the same because they take place in an alternate universe so it's OK. Eye candy? (Graphics) let's face it, if that's the only reason why you are going to see a movie then you should really just stay home. I've seen people say that things aren't explained like why the seventh son had to go with the spook, why this and why that.... The seventh son takes place in medieval times, the boy was bought and paid for, life wasn't, and still isn't free in a lot of places and that's just the way it was back then like it or not. It just takes a little historical knowledge to understand why things transpired the way they did. Perhaps that's why a lot of people didn't like it, they just aren't educated enough in history to understand. Perhaps they are judgmental because they read the book first, I really don't know but it was definitely a good movie.",Seventh Son

But pleasantly film involve me.it exceed and exceed from my expectations.Although its bit similar to Hobbit but it was not very far from that standard. In short words i love that movie.

Alicia and Ben create a romantic angle that might be appreciated by a S.O. that you need to convince to watch this fantasy flick and Jeff delivers some refreshing comedy into a largely dark setting. If you expect nothing beforehand and if you're looking for magic & swords clashing in cool battles you should have a great time watching this.

125,botha-rudy,Baddddd!!!!,1,10 January 2015,"This was incredibly bad and you will most like feel ashamed and angry for even trying to get through this movie. Why do we keep hoping a book to cinema transformation will be authentic to the book. I think it failed because they tried to make it less distinctive and more similar to other YA fantasy movies. It all feels to familiar and in a bad way...I think the producers and directors just don't get it. They don't want to make these movies because they flop every time. But these books can be great if they stay true to the source material.The acting was terrible Juilianna Moore's character was so familiar and predictably boring, Jeff Bridges had this horrible over acted voice and face (mostly i could not understand his mumbling), and Ben Barnes and his character ended up being nothing special.SPOILER ALERT - I had no clue as to the seventh son of a seventh son - explanations writers, directors, actors? Anyone? What should I care if you have a monster on your side with a ugly face if you don't explain his origin or anything about him.I mostly felt nothing for any of the characters. Then their is the illogical flow of the story. Why would you save a witch and just let her go, even after you have seen the evil looking dreams about her??? Then again at the end the apprentice and the witch can't be together because, they are both without a family and he is a spook and she is a witch also old spook is retiring. So remind me again why can't they be together o yes it doesn't make sense at least it might have been better explained if they didn't go off book.The magical world is what this is about and half the time your wondering What is that? and What is he? Why is he special? They fight and yet it still is boring honestly the witches however cliché they might be are more interesting than the two spooks.Anyway that is my opinion, we will have more of this until the studios realize how important the source material is and that sticking to it is the best. Examples of the success when sticking to the source are Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, Hunger Games. Not sticking to source material examples are Eragon, The Seeker, The Giver, beautiful creatures etc... Stop trying to make clones of good movies and make good movies.Just because we like hunger games does not mean we want to see ten different versions of hunger games.

Second of all, the poster of this movie everywhere advertises an army, well guess what, there were barely 20 to begin with, and the whole plot was to stop a queen that somewhat had the powers of the ''blood moon'' to destroy the planet yet only commands a shitty 8 Limbed swordsman (got killed with one damn slice), A Giant Bear transforming guy that deforms him when using damn silver (dunno why the army had two battalions killed when they can simply get silver dust to kill him), A retarded Dragon transforming guy (not a dragon, a retarded representation of a dragon with no wings) that doesn't transform to fight his opponent because ''honour'', then the protagonist tells him ''you should have stayed a dragon'' why?, a retarded leopard transforming girl (the most useless skill ever in medieval times) and dies one slice too. IT SEEMS TO ME, the kingdoms could've obliterated the Blood Queen's forces when they could, sure 40 or more will die, but they would literally kill the entirety of the story's problem if they wanted to.

There may actually be a decent story under this mess but I couldn't even make it half way through the film.What this movie is about has more to do with someone who really wanted to make a movie that had deep pockets but no understanding of story telling or continuity. The film fails spectacularly somewhere in the mix of writing, editing and direction. I suspect the film editors did what they could but the writer/directer combo falls miserably short.

134,bLINDINZI,Lacking originality,6,29 March 2015,"As films of this genre go it's well filmed with a reasonable script, some very good Imax stuff in both the CGI, dragons, demons, and monsters that are liberally sprinkled throughout and that rise up from the underworld a plenty, unfortunately none are original enough to be worth remembering; which is probably the best overall impression I can give you for the film as a whole not very memorable. The Soundtrack creates great atmosphere at times in what is to all intents and purposes a reasonably engaging film, just lacking originality!The actors all deliver their lines well enough, although I do have to say Mr Bridges at times is so concentrating on the character he has created, that he does mumble and the words get lost somewhere in his beard.The downside, if downside is the right word is that there is little that is original or makes it stand apart, unfortunately most of the ideas that make up the plot seem to have come from many of the others films that share this genre, with some very close attachments to LOTR, and the Hobbit at times.It's not that the plot copies the leaders in the field its just that there isn't a far enough divide and for me; as such spoilt a film that promised so much at the outset, and turned out as a prety average end product.

135,notaris818,Review - 'Seventh Son',5,3 April 2015,"N.B. I will endeavour to not give anything anyway (i.e. no spoilers).I just saw this film in the cinema. It is OK - you know the plot, it's quite typical, basically innocent teen is destined to be somebody, taken under wing of cool old guy, turns out there's more than meets the eye - remind you of anything? (*cough* hunger games, *cough* divergent, etc...)However, it is differentiated from other similar films by its fantasy aspect, making it more of the 'Clash of the Titans' or 'Robin Hood'.1) Screenplay - There is little character development - we do not get to know the protagonist very well, just as some boy. We get a good insight into Jeff Bridges' character Master Gregory, but backstory is lacking in the other characters. The story itself is rather cliché, one we've seen many times.2) Acting - Jeff Bridges does quite a good job as the ageing warlock, sort of a drunk Gandalf, though not as heart-warming as his roles in the Big Lebowski or True Grit. Julianne Moore is convincing as the villain, and personally I thought Olivia Williams was outstanding, but the other actors, including the protagonist, fall by the wayside a little.3) Cinematography and the film's Score offer nothing particularly noteworthy, though support the film itself.The CGI is... good, I would say, and offers some entertaining action scenes, especially with original weapons - Djimon Hounsou wielding axe-heads on chains is quite a sight. Although I at no point thought 'well, that's obviously fake', neither did I think 'well, that looks particularly realistic'.The film relies on its CGI to carry it through, which a film shouldn't do - the CGI should be a supporting characteristic, not the backbone of the movie.In conclusion, the film offers very little that is original, nor will there be any BAFTAs or Oscars for its actors. If you are a film buff or explore a wide range of movies, then you will probably consider this a waste of your time.However, although the same story that we see all the time, it nonetheless has many entertaining elements and fight scenes, so if you are a fan of the fantasy genre, or perhaps have read the book, then you will probably not be disappointed with this film - nor will you be especially pleased either.The Best aspects: Olivia Williams was great. That moment when Jeff Bridges swears (the F-word) was hilarious.",Seventh Son

No regrets paying to see it in theater which is more than I could say with the third hobbit movie. Reminds me of a merlin/arthur like film sprinkled in with some brothers grimm/season of the witch. Well done, nothing incredible, but no over the top or in my opinion failed special effects or actions. Nothing against any of the actors either. If I had to grade it as a movie over all, not a A but a solid B-B-. For what it did in the medieval fantasy genre especially compared to what we have seen from that genre as of late, it hits the A there sure.

But it is underdeveloped and the acting was very very sloppy. There were too many cheesy and lame parts. Even Jeff Bridges in this movie sucks.

For the good parts; The action scenes and fighting were well shot and it was very fun to watch. The CGI effects were really good and the sound tracks were very epic. Since this movie is based on a book, I can say that the storyline is all right.

A spook needs a seventh son to be his apprentice to fight against evil witches and monsters mainly the queen of witches, played by Julianne Moore who plays this part deliciously. She proves she can play any character . Also Jeff Bridges plays the spook and I realized they were both in the movie "" The Big Lebowski"" together . ha ha ha this film moves pleasantly fast, has great special effects without being gory.

The bad guys were very much on the ""meh"" side, most of the demon and witches who were supposed to bring end to the world generally acts like thugs with bad temper instead of any real power.The climax was something special, without spoiling the fun, it's like watching two giants about to pound each other to death, then one of them fell, hit his head on a rock and died.

145,ritikaprasad,The predicament of the approaching blood moon,3,4 May 2015,"Let's begin with the obvious- non-pleasing predictability, aesthetically disturbing VFX, overtly unrelated scene sequences and an unhealthy obsession with glitter/silver powder! This overall constitutes Seventh Son, directed by Sergei Bodrov. Based on the Spook's apprentice by Joseph Delaney, I am sure the book was readable because the movie was unwatchable. Jeff Bridges brought his usual Lebowski swagger to the film and Moore had an amazing satanic screen presence. The other characters with considerable screen presence- Thomas the damned seventh son of some seventh son who was happy to leave his home and his threatening/eager to let go mother and he also has spoiler visions which will keep telling you throughout the entire movie of what is about to come. And the other, the presumably good witch (love interest) who is excellent at disappearing like Batman. God alone knows what this movie was about, it's like Ghostbusters meets sorcerer's apprentice meets Battle of the 'seven' armies, with characters lamely coming, introducing themselves(hello!) and going just like the magic in the feature( remember tusk?). The predicament of the approaching blood moon was more terrifying for the viewers than Master Gregory and his kin. (Yes, some of us sat that long through the film). Should have regarded 'the signs of evil' before sitting down for this movie. Alas the ringing bells echoed oh! Mother of god.",Seventh Son
146,votoole-00090,Review of the movie,7,29 December 2015,"I saw this movie on On Demand and decided to watch it. After seeing the trailer, I had a pretty good idea about what the movie was going to be about, but let me tell you it turned out to be a pretty well created movie. I just want to start out and say that the writers and the direct, Sergey Bodrov did an excellent job at creating the monsters. The C.G.I. was amazing. The monsters and shape shifters transformations were very well done. At one time in the movie the our heroes battled a man that changed into a bear and the transitions between man and bear were done beautifully. This movie was definitely action packed with different battles and fight scenes between good and bad all leading up to the end battle against the destruction of the earth. Even though this organization sounds typically, which for the most part it was, the actors played their parts well. The part that stood out to me that most was Jeff Bridges part. His character Master Gregory, his a heartless old man that has a very dangerous job; he was to hunt down and kill witches. Throughout the movie his character has to train a young apprentice his ways, which in many ways becomes the comic relief in the movie. Jeff Bridges' character often forgets or tells his lessons while they are happening so his apprentice has to learn on the job. Also, it helps that Bridges has a low under tone in his voice that makes it all the more comedic. In all the movie was very well made and played very nicely. If there was one thing I would add to the movie it would be a better explanation of the importance of the ""Seventh Son"". The movie is a little to action based when it comes to that part, by as soon as the master finds the new apprentice he gets thrown right into action and the movie doesn't explain the apprentice's background. The movie is named after the apprentice but still to this day i'm not sure why he had to the Seventh Son of the Seventh Son.",Seventh Son
147,motets,Should have been top on Razzie list of Worst Films,1,15 January 2016,"Right off the bat you know this will not be a great film when American-accented actors jar your ears in a period piece set in European medieval times. American Oscar winners Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges both try to carry off an accent, so why didn't the other top-billed stars, Ben Barnes and Alicia Vikander? What makes this all the more bizarre is that Ben Barnes is British, as is Olivia Williams who also affected an American accent! Something I learned from the bonus material on the DVD. What weird thinking drove that decision? From there it continued downhill. I found myself shaking my head repeatedly. Other reviews pointed out the film's triteness, disjointedness, poor editing, terrible music scoring, and miscasting. Makes one appreciate the true artistry and skill it takes to make a good fantasy film such as Lord of the Rings. You can tell that the star-power actors had high hopes for this film.

151,TomPeeler,Seventh Son - So Bad It Doesn't Deserve a Clever Review Headline,1,15 February 2015,"Do you remember seeing trailers for Legendary Pictures' Seventh Son in theaters as far back as 2012? I do, because I have no life. But more importantly, it's because this movie was due out 3 years ago. Instead it was delayed, shelved, and passed between studios so many times it's embarrassingly telling. Now it's finally seeing the light of day, and honestly, it should've stayed somewhere dark and damp. Like the bottom of the ocean. Because Seventh Son is a waste of time, talent, and money so egregious, everyone involved should have to perform community service.It's dumb. And not just dumb but eye-rolling dumb. It has the scope and style of The Lord of The Rings but matches that with all the substance of an 80's adventure movie. And not one of the good ones either. The LOTR comparison may sound cliché, but it's fitting because just from the poster, you can TELL this is a film delayed from the era of studios trying to make their own LOTR knock-offs. Remember Eragon? The Seeker? 47 Ronin? This is a film commissioned by studio execs who KNOW what LOTR is but don't understand WHY those movies worked.What do I mean by that? Seventh Son's failures in the contemporary fantasy department start from its opening moments, when characters start spouting off dialogue that implies a whole universe of lore without any context or background. Some of it is simple, easy to grasp. Holy order of knights fighting off witches? Sure. I'll buy that. But then the sleep-walking actors start unenthusiastically throwing up all this mythical importance about Spooks and Seventh Sons and Blood Moons; until ultimately I stopped trying to pay attention and started trying to think up a Seventh Son drinking game. If the filmmakers couldn't put effort into making sense of this movie, then why should I put any effort into being sober for this movie?The baffling questions left unanswered throughout the film are so offensive they should be considered a hate crime against the audience. Is Jeff Bridges' Gregory supposed to be a holy man or a mercenary for hire? Because he does some jobs out of nobility but then others he's demanding money. Is Tom Ward, the Seventh Son, a destined hero or some dude Jeff Bridges literally bought like a slave? Because we keep getting stressed the importance of those who are ""Seventh Sons"" but Gregory seems to see Ward as a completely disposable intern. And in the end, the Seventh Son doesn't fulfill his destiny in any meaningful way; instead defeating the antagonist through what amounts to a sucker punch AFTER another character does all the work. Imagine Luke Skywalker stabbing Emperor Palpatine in the back after Palpatine fought a Stormtrooper off for twenty minutes. Satisfying? Heroic? Didn't think so.Scene geography. What? Scenes start on grassy fields and inexplicably end on mountain tops. Competent pacing and editing structure. What? Big reveals come about with no build up, seemingly important scenes last 20 seconds while visceral nonsense lasts forever. An entire genocide happens as payback for actions by Gregory and Ward, and there's NO payoff to it. Sensical character development. What? Big sub-villains are introduced and thrown away a scene later. One of them, called the ""King Of Swords,"" loses a sword fight to a helpless character with no combat experience MINUTES after we watch this King kill 4 guys at once in a sword fight. Performances. What? To call these paycheck performances is an insult to paycheck performers, because nearly everyone in this movie sounds like they want to be doing something else. Moore has some fun vamping it up as the film's big bad, but the material is un-savable. Bridges spends the entire film doing a poor man's Ian McKellen, and in general, is as miscast as Elizabeth Olsen would be as the lead in a Barack Obama biopic.I could go on forever. This is a movie so bad it leaves you angry after its over. When Universal teamed up with Legendary pictures last year, I was so pumped. Legendary's previous partnership with Warner Bros gave us Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, 300, Inception, Watchmen, The Hangover, Godzilla, and The Town. Not all masterpieces, but all LEAGUES above the quality they now churn out with Universal. Together thus far they've pumped out nothing but middling tripe, until finally hitting the bottom with this. Seventh Son holds no merit. Tie it to a rocket and throw it into the sun. Please, someone, do that. Now.",Seventh Son

153,franksanchez2,Not bad.,7,29 June 2015,"I'm gonna give this film a 10 just to bump up it's grade a little but I think it is more of a 7 out of 10.Seventh Son, directed by Sergei Bodrov, is a 2014 medieval-style fantasy-adventure. It stars Ben Barnes as the main character, Jeff Bridges as a mentor figure, Alicia Vikander, Djimon Hounsou, John DeSantis as supporting characters and Julianne Moore as the villain. This movie is a basic telling of a basic story. Although many critics disliked this movie, I thought it wasn't bad. I also haven't read the book that it was based on so I can't compare them. That being saidThe plot was predictable and the movie didn't bring anything new to the table but there were a few aspects that made the film enjoyable even though there wasn't a whole lot of substance to it. Young farmer Thomas Ward (played by Ben Barnes) is recruited by ""Spook"" or monster hunter Gregory (played by Jeff Bridges) who claims that Tom is part of a prophecy to become his apprentice. Tom, who has been having visions of Gregory, agrees to join Gregory on his quest to defeat the evil witch Mother Malkin (played by Julianne Moore). Along the way, Tom and Gregory (along with Gregory's creature assistant Tusk) encounter many monsters and witches including a were-bear, some kind of ground- troll, Malkin's minions and a variety of witches that turn into dragons. Throughout the journey, Tom meets the beautiful Alice and falls in love with her, but she turns out to be a witch. She convinces him that not all witches are bad and tries to get him to run away with her. When he refuses she betrays him and steals a magic stone that Mother Malkin needed to take over the world. This leads to the climax where there is a big battle between all the aforementioned characters and Mother Malkin is defeated. Tom and Alice makeup and Gregory realizes that not all witches are bad. Gregory leaves Tom to go on another mission and brands him as a knight. For some reason Alice also leaves, claiming that they will meet again. Although the plot was a little bland and convoluted at the same time, to me there were a few redeeming qualities to it. The movie created a pretty cool world with monsters and witches and magic and beautiful scenery reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings saga but on a much smaller scale. The cinematography in particular was very well done with good camera work during the action sequences including pans and long takes. The acting was solid; Barnes, Bridges and Vikander did a good job (although there were some scenes when the CGI didn't coordinate too well with the acting). The CGI looked pretty good for the most part. On the other hand, the screenplay was weak; a lot of scenes were lacking in charisma even though the actors did their best with the lines they had. The plot was somewhat unimaginative and lacked substance throughout. The characters and their relationships with each other were pretty entertaining for the most part. Barnes played his character well and was relatable as the unsuspecting hero. Jeff Bridges' character Gregory was solid as the careless and pushy mentor. As shown with Kit Harington's small role at the beginning, Gregory seemed to care more about accomplishing his mission then what happened to Tom. Ben Barnes and Jeff Bridges had a lot of chemistry as mentor and apprentice and made some boring and poorly-written scenes more enjoyable. Alicia Vikander also did a good job as the flirty witch Alice. Vikander and Barnes have a lot of chemistry on screen and are often flirting throughout the movie. They make a good couple and the fact that there is a large barrier between them coupled with how their relationship is built up makes their love believable and relatable. Especially towards the end of the movie after Alice betrays Tom but still cares for him, you can understand how they both have strong feelings for each other but are mad at each other, (reminiscent of Will and Elizabeth's roller-coaster relationship in Pirates of the Caribbean). Tom and Alice's romance is different from most films, especially because it isn't clear until the end whose side Alice is on. It keeps you guessing. The one thing I didn't understand was why Alice didn't stay with Tom in the end, especially after Gregory explained that he would leave and Tom needed to stay and not go anywhere? These three and John DeSantis' silent Chewbacca-like character of Tusk stood out in the film. Everyone else was bland and boring. Julianne Moore's character of Mother Malkin was completely forgettable and Djimon Hounsou (who is a fantastic actor) did pretty much nothing but try to seem menacing. All-in-all, this movie was a decent popcorn flick with a generic plot, bad screen writing, and lack of depth but has decent world-building, character relationships, good acting, good action and CGI. Check it out if you can't find anything to watch and you want to be entertained. I'd give this film a C+ or a 7/10.",Seventh Son
154,lord-horn-asstr,Okay-ish,5,21 March 2015,"The real reason, why something felt ""off kilter"" in this movie is the young hero.While it's all good to have a ""weak"" hero, who turns into his ""inner strength"" in the time of his crisis, the hero does not, for a moment, seems to be ""strong"".And I'm tired of seeing movies with ""weak heroes"" who defeat the ""villain"" because of who ""they are associated with"" rather than ""on the strength of their own backbone and initiative."" Wish the writers and screen casters had taken a greater time making and finding a strong young hero, respectively.Its never fun to see the hero win because of ""someone else's"" help. A hero is a hero. And in the end, the absolute end, he HAS to fight and defeat the villain by the strength of his own courage and ability.

157,tcydolphin,Full of potential but very under-developed,4,26 April 2015,"Sevenths Son looked to be a very promising plot when i first read it (which fantasy movie isn't) I had high hopes for it, to be honest, but was disappointed with the film.Let's be frank, the cohesiveness of the plot wasn't all that good. Mother Malkin was the 'queen of all evil and darkness'; and you would think that she's fearsome and unformidable. Sadly, Mother Malkin crumbles with a few stabs of the tail and knife - what happened to the blood moon strengthening her powers? Her various minions, looked to be so promising, turned out to be such fragile creatures as if they were a piece of paper. The so-called ""finest assassins"" wasn't so fine at all when they fell to the ground with one hit (mind you, on the torso) of the stick. The king of swords, didn't really know how to handle his swords well, snake-man was killed by a spark (i half expected him to pull the pitch fork out of him) and the beautiful cheetah didn't hear Tom coming from the back.It's also a pity that these fascinating characters were not given enough screen time and abilities (i have no idea why the movie is shorter than the normal films). Withe a longer screen time and a little more sophistication, i felt that the movie could be a 7/8 instead of a 4. Malkin and her minions should also have some bad-ass abilities that would require more effort to defeat themIn summary, the effects did the movie glory much more than the plot which is kinda sad because it is really a huge disappointment to see a plot full of possibilities and cool effects receive such a low rating.Watch if you don't expect much but are big on the effectsP.S: I got a little irritated because Gregory said that the Stone had enormous power in Malkin's hands but Tom's mother said only Tom could wield it.

This movie is so damn awful that it is hardly worth wasting any time composing words to even write a negative review about this movie but my frustration and anger has motivated me to write an awful review. The script is bad, the acting is bad and the movie overall is just bad. It almost seems as if this movie was filmed without a director. This director should never even be allowed to direct a movie like this. The acting is just absolutely bad and I don't really blame the actors, it's just it feels like the director did not guide these actors how to act or what type of behaviours or emotions to display on camera. I believe Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore are both great at acting but it seems like the script they were given were very poor and essentially made it look like it was their acting that looks bad. The sound effects of this movie feels like it was filmed back in the 60s very cheesy and out-dated. Also when making a movie like this, it should be noted to eliminate American accents simply because it just does not work!! As I'm writing this review, I am actually only 36 minutes into the movie but this movie is just so bad that it doesn't even come close to luring my attention towards the screen. If you are planning to watch this movie, save your money and time. Even if you were offered to watch this for free, save your time lol. It honestly isn't worth it.

160,Vaduen,"For Fantasy Fans Who Enjoy The Genre, It's An OK Watch.",5,21 February 2015,"I can see why critics and people in general are dissing the film. I think the problem with the film, is that it's director, Sergey Bodrov has never done a film of this scope. At least, never a film with a budget of 95 million dollars. The film is 102 minutes long. Had it been longer, I think many more ""things"" could have been better explained. It just seemed some of the scenes were out of sequence, or, didn't have enough detail. Had this film had Peter Jackson, or Guillermo del Toro at the helm, it would have been an entirely different film. Considering the LOTR series each had about the same budget, this film could have been so much more.The film seemed fragmented. It reminded me of the failed film Eragon, where you suddenly go from farm boy, to instantly learning Elvish, knowing how to fight, and just ""knowing"" everything. We need to see the characters develop.Now, I'm a hard core fan of this genre. I'll be the first to admit, that pairing Jeff Bridges with Julianne Moore was a great idea. While we get more background on Bridge's character than we do with other characters in the film, their performances, while quite acceptable could have been much better. Personally, I thought Bridges portrayal of Master Gregory was well executed. Again, I think the director was perhaps the main problem, reigning in their performances.I keep seeing articles and reviews from people who've read the book, then bash the film because the film itself is so far separated from the text. I don't like to compare books to film, simply because you can go into so much more detail in a book. I have to say it. I still enjoyed the film even though it left a lot of unanswered questions for me. If you like the fantasy series, as I do, then go into the film without preconceptions, and, enjoy it for what it is, entertainment.

This film is in no way based on that series, but rather another series about a ""seven-squared"" which I am not familiar with. As such, my view of the movie is based strictly on the movie itself, and has nothing to do with the book series. Which, as I understand it, was not followed at all well.As an afternoon's entertainment, it was not bad. You have a standard set of elements which can work together well, and do a decent job here. There is the crusty old ""master"", the innocent apprentice, the evil, powerful villain with nasty henchmen (and women), and the dewy love interest.The master (Jeff Bridges) is a ""spook"", or professional ""dark creature"" hunter. He obviously has problems besides his drinking, and speaks in a strange voice which is disturbing at first. Either we get used to it or he mellows it as the film progresses. The apprentice (Ben Barnes) is a bit of a klutz, who has to learn the spook trade ""in a week"". The girl (Alicia Vikander), who may or may not be what she seems, seems kind of ""thrown in"" because we expect such a character. That is, the story could have gotten along without her. And the chief villain (Julianne Moore) doesn't seem to have any particular goal/plan except to cause fear and destruction throughout the land. And get rid of Master Gregory, of course.Still, their interactions give us plenty of opportunity for interesting action scenes, and the story, such as it is, is reasonably cohesive.

Because of this I found myself 1. predicting what was going to happen accurately, and 2. not really caring to discover how the plot developed in the film. The heart could have saved this and that was the big fail here. From the onset the movie did little to inspire the audience in its beauty, little to get the audience engaged in the journeys of the characters, and very little to make the audience care about the characters. There was no heart in any of these characters nor between any of them and the movie itself felt like someone had replaced its heart with a computer chip that delivered the story line rote.I almost found myself bored at certain points and my mom was disappointed too (and that's saying something since in my family my mom is famous for loving awful movies).It is hard to believe that Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges could deliver such flat uninspiring characters, but they did.

168,asm-st,The assassination of a story that could have become THE fantasy saga of the next decade.,2,30 April 2015,"First of all, as a big fan of the book series written by Joseph Delaney, I was very happy when I heard the making of a movie. The story in the books is amazing, unique! The atmosphere is very stressful and at the end of each book, you just can't wait to read the next one! And yesterday I watched the movie. The only question that comes to my mind is WHY ? Why, indeed, did Hollywood destroy this movie saga before it even started? It could have been so great, but they just decided to put tons of action, tons of useless fights, useless characters and a plot written by a young child. They just took the names and one or two other things from the books and (badly) re-imagined the rest. Why did Warner even bother buying the story rights ? What was the point in associating this movie with the book series when they have completely rewritten it ? After this big disappointment, I tried to watch the rest of the movie without thinking of the real book story. And yet again, it was bad ! The quotes are foreseeable a mile in advance ! The special effects aren't good and the set is disgusting ! Did they take a red screen instead of a green or what ? The only positive aspect of this movie is Jeff Bridges' performance. I can totally imagine him as the real Spook, in a movie following the books. So, if Hollywood makes a sequel (which is highly unlikely), please make them lose money, don't go watch it and make them pay for this awful assassination.",Seventh Son

170,joshuaxie1993,Great visualisation BUT lacked everything else,4,21 February 2015,"The only thing that was attractive was the visualisation of mystical creatures and monsters. Witches transforming into dragons, weird demons getting summoned were spectacular but unfortunately nothing else in the movie could carry it on. The plot was on the slightly boring side but that could be over looked. The real sins are listed below which would have made it much better despite the boring story.1) Relationships lacked serious development. Grumpy teacher-""hardworking but useless"" pupil relationship was so cliché it pained me to see what interesting skills would be learnt (other than sprinkling iron or silver filing). None. Dashing Ben Barnes (Tom) and Alicia Vikander (Alice) had potential for a wonderful romantic relationship HOWEVER, the lack of proper development made it look (sadly) like a superficial crush of a boy who was never met a decent looking girl. Calling the relationship true love just because you had visions of her and seen her swimming in a lake under the moonlight made this look like an ""Anna-Hans"" relationship from Frozen. 2) With such a powerful antagonist such as Mother Malkin, there was definitely much more room to level up our dear protagonist to her level, have a spectacular one-on-one showdown before finally having her die a spectacular death. Instead, it was more like the work of the mystical staff that Tom could suddenly activate, killing most opponents with a single strike. Killing Mother Malkin with a single random hidden dagger was truly insulting, seeing how Mother Malkin was previously impervious to most attacks. Oh and Tom did not really kill the creature in the woods, he kinda kamikazed with it, and he was lucky the fall down the water fall killed the creature and not him. The amount of luck this kid had to escape every situation really deducted his perceived ability to actually defeat Mother Malkin.",Seventh Son
171,forsterpeter,Nothing new but decent time filler,7,7 June 2015,"i went into this with very little expectations and was not disappointed. There is literally not a single in this movie you won't have seen before. From the grizzled old war horse with sad back story to the Disney like evil witch, young unknowing hero with hidden unknown power? Check. Comedy sidekick? Check. Peripheral bad guy posse for good guys to chew through? Check. Like I said nothing new. So why my 7/10 rating? 2 main reasons - bridges hams his way through his role brilliantly, he knew he wasn't gonna win an Oscar for this and has fun with it. Moore clearly enjoyed playing the big bad and I found her a joy to watch ( always fancied her so might be a bit biased on that one), but she plays her role perfectly, nothing more, nothing less.

176,PennyRose2020,I mean... why?!? What have you done?!?,2,2 June 2020,"The book collection The Spook Apprentice by John Delaney is sooo good!
I mean... why?!?
I really don't mind a good adaptation, something very different from the original material, but all these changes add nothing to the story. It makes it shallow and poor, even when the action and the special effects are good.So many questions after watching this...
Why make Tom older? I mean you can, but why? Why is it better that way? To have a love story, the biggest cliché? Alice and Tom's relationship is so much more complex than that, they met when they were both 12 years old.
Ok, you tried to put a lot in one movie to create an impact. But this story was not meant to be told this way. Tom's journey is a long apprenticeship. Not a ""You have to be ready in a week or you die"" apprenticeship. We grow with him, a bit like Harry Potter fans, who followed the trio since they were young.
And it's not all about witches (yes, they are the most dangerous creatures in the story, I agree), but there are tons of others fantastic/mythical creatures that Tom needs to learn about.John Delaney's universe is much more elaborated and deep than what they did with this movie... The way Tom mets Alice with her pointy shoes, the first night he spends in a haunted house, alone, as his first challenge, trying to confront his fear, the manipulation of Mother Malkin from her prison down the hole before she escapes... NONE OF THAT IS IN THE MOVIE!!! #whyI give two stars though, because in the book, witches are only female, which is probably the only point that really bothers me in the Spook's stories. At least in the movie, witches can be anyone.Still, if you want a good sorcerer/witch story, go rent or buy the books. I promise, they are so easy to read (especially the first one) and definitely better than this movie. Hollywood, you just wasted an opportunity to build a great movie franchise.

177,lucky93-1,It will surprise you,7,22 March 2015,"Amazing film in my opinion, its a medieval fantasy of which there aren't that many that are good. The plot is clichéd typical guy with destiny saves the day, love interest and a mentor with cheese one- liners. But in my opinion it really comes together, the attention to detail is what makes the movie, you can believe that really can exist. Best comparison i can give is the Witcher universe you, honestly change the names and the plot and you can step in Geralt's world. And also there is a little bit of Dark Souls in there. I liked some of the cgi, but there is also some really bad for a 2014 film.

In the book tom is about 12 and is from Northern England. I don't understand the all American cast when they should all sound like they're from Northern England. In the film Tom's mother knows about the spook but is shocked by his arrival. In the book, before Tom is born his mother tells the spook she will give birth to the saviour of the county and that he will be the spooks last apprentice.

Hire someone who will just say no to whoever keeps thinking that you can make it better then it already is.The special effects were superb and the acting by all involved from range from fair to great (Bridges and Moore rarely fail me).

Let's face it, the story is not as deep as Harry Potter or LOTR, nor the budget as epic, but it's fast-paced story, CG-heavy fantasy action and one-liners is entertaining enough for me to not feel I wasted 2 hours.
I was impressed by the filming locations and detailed sets, which added character depth and made it more enjoyable. For example, I was really impressed to see Master Gregory's house had a smelter and weapons collection.
Fans of Skyrim will love seeing the characters trek through lush mountains and row over crystal lakes.
The acting was decent with Jeff Bridges the one who seemed to be having the most fun playing a grumpy drunk witch-hunter. He really transformed into a character reminiscent of Gandalf, which unfortunately made everyone else seem mediocre.
I also felt the story moved really fast during important story moments and became really slow during romantic scenes. Is that a teenage genre thing? The characters act like they are on a time crunch and then spend way too long gazing into each other's eyes.
Overall I give the film a B and enjoyed it the mideval fantasy sets/props, and Jeff Bridges. The story and other actors were teetering on mediocre, but the CG actions was entertaining enough to carry it through.",Seventh Son

There were small things that they changed, but there was mostly big things that were changed. Like when in the movie, we know Alice is Bony Lizzie's daughter from at the start, but in the books we don't find that out until the fifth or sixth book.

Bridges speaks like a cowboy with marbles in his mouth, Moore looks like someones mom at a costume party, and the rest of the Nickelodeon gang seemed out of place in a medieval fantasy film, usually dominated by Brits. The screenplay seems written by a twelve year old, the acting is predictable, and painful. The special effects at times seems brilliant, and at other times unfinished or artificial. I get irritated when movies like this show winter scenes and nobody's breath is seen when they speak. At other times, it would start raining but the rain would not hit the character, and then the next scene they would all be wet, lol. It's as if the entire movie was shot on a green screen.

Or do we start at the cringe-worthy accent breaks that would cause one to erupt in laughter in the cinema?No, let's start on a positive note. John DeSantis, the 6 foot 9 actor made of pure talent, charisma and charm and his role as the true hero of the movie, ""Tusk"" swept the audience off their tacky, rusted cinema seats in his performance which would put his cousin Chewbacca to shame. A stellar performance, mind body and spirit. The misunderstood soul of Tusk emanates through DeSantis' passionate grunts, snores and nightmares which do a top job of drowning out the flat dialogue between lovers in a romantic subplot worse than Spongebob and Gary. But we need to look at the symbolism and meaning of Tusks performance, what is the moral of Tusk? After receiving multiple insults and aggravated verbal abuse by senile gandalf, Jeff Bridges; Tusk does not flinch nor does it degrade the characters enigma for good and his glowing performance. When words are thrown like spears 'You are resilient as your are ugly Tusk' it may corrupt even the strongest characters but the directors strategic motive was to promote resilience and defense against bullies we face in life, at school, at the workplace.

It is a bit of a fairy tail - Worth Watching!The only issues it has is that some conversations and some of the characters behavior are a bit... I'd say wooden... simple. Part of the conversations do not bring the importance that they are supposed to and they sound a bit useless this way. Characters act quite stiffly and... somehow unprepared for the act they are supposed to do (I hope I express myself understandably so far).Apart from that all else brings a great experience of the movie.Combats are not boringly long (very important by my opinion) and not with too much flips, jumps, twisting and CGI (apart from fairy creatures). CGI itself is 8/10 points, by my opinion. Considering, it is a fantasy and it needs the CGI every corner of the way of the movie and yet, the effect of it is not dropped at places where it is, indeed, not needed. It is not annoyingly too much!The movie is worth the money at 3D, IMAX or any other way you can afford it. It is good for getting your head out of reality for a bit and see some favorite fantasy creatures or some new. I had good time watching it twice!!! :DAlso do not expect that it is an ecranisation of the books and do not be disappointed by that FACT. It does not say anywhere that it is!!! (I think)P.S. I hope I have expressed myself well enough!",Seventh Son
207,karimathmazou,Why..,1,26 May 2015,"As i laid in my bed watching this very poor excuse of a movie,wondering if the scriptwriter of that utter abomination was still employed, I realized that it was my duty to go through the trouble,on that fine Sunday evening, of creating an IMDb account, give the lowest grade possible to that piece of garbage, and write a review to make sure that no true fan of the book series will ever have to endure what I am right now. I would sit through a 20 hour long continuous screening of Fifty shade of Grey without the right to blink and a smile on my face before watching that movie ever again. It feels like the screenwriter asked the author to quickly summarized vague informations about the books, after which he decided to ignore most of them and add unnecessary components to the story.If you want to make Tom the titular character ooze sex appeal by turning him into a 40 year old looking- suppose to play a 20 year old actor-to attract more demography fine i guess, but making mother malkin hot when she is supposed to be a evil and disgusting baby eating witch....Julianne Moore I thought you were better than that... Shame on you Joseph Delaney for authorizing such a travesty of your books, I hope the blood money was worth it. Now I know that when books are turned into a movie it's never as good, but this movie adaptation for me is the same thing as remaking Romeo and Juliet and having Juliet twerk on romeo's dead body and end the movie like that, leaving the audience shocked and wondering how this came to be.",Seventh Son
208,muraign,I did not see it all,4,12 June 2015,"I cannot make an honest and unbiased opinion of this movie as I didn't watch it all, probably about a third. What I did see was a well directed dark fantasy, and it was darkly filmed too but great special effects. The reason why I only watched up to the farmers' son being enrolled as the new apprentice was the fact that I couldn't make out what Jeff Bridges was saying most of the time and I just couldn't watch any more. He seems to talk with some king of brace in his mouth, forcing his lower jaw forward thereby muffling the sound. I noticed it in Iron man and also True Grit. Don't get me wrong, I think Jeff Bridges is a fine actor and I will go back to the Seventh Son to complete an honest review in the future, but please Jeff, talk normally.",Seventh Son
209,shimerslaton,Nothing like the books.... horrible,1,12 June 2015,"This movie is an abomination! It has no resemblance to the book series, they simply used the names. A pity because if they had followed the story line of the book series I bet it would have been a success. But no, the film makers could not leave it alone and fortunately it bombed. I had read it was a horrible movie, but curiosity got the best of me and I have regret my decision to watch this ghastly movie. I still haven't figured out what was in Jeff Bridges mouth throughout the movie. Was he chewing tobacco or has he a poor set of dentures, wooden? I also wonder why they choose to make the Tom Ward character a simpleton? Was it bad acting an attempt to act like a 30 year old child. Hopefully, this dreadful movie will not ruin Julianne Moore's career, she is an excellent actress, given good material. The lucky one was Kit Harington, he dies early in the movie.",Seventh Son
210,anshaj-30243,Awesome movie,10,17 June 2015,"I saw the trailer and i got what i expected, Scenery is very nice, well amount of money spent on the film set. Story is simple and pure fantasy, Nice special effects, I found it better than hobbit series, i don't know why it has so low rating. I say must watch if you are fan of fantasy movies and like beautiful witches and demon type movies.Story is about a apprentice who learns how to kill demons and get trained by a old man. The hero has a red stone which has powers to defeat all and make him super cool then the hero falls in love with a good witch and save her twice from dying. Hero's mom dies while saving her village from the witches wrath and the revenge is taken by hero at the last he kills the head of all witches who is stupid kind of woman and the most powerful witch.

211,thhour-29352,31 reasons why this is a faceless adaptation of a beloved book series,1,18 October 2015,"A List of 31 Reasons Why Any Human Should Avoid This Film At ALL Costs.1. It obliterated a unique series of novels 2. Abysmal casting choices 3. It is an English story yet it's set in the USA 4. The writing is equivalent to that of fan fiction 5. One dimensional characters that you're supposed to care about 6. Terrible acting 7. Why is the main character British when everyone else is American? 8. Jeff Bridges does his best attempt at Gandalf's voice and fails 9. Generic story-lines 10. Characters have under developed and ever changing backstories 11. The Spook has a code of honor... when he feels like it. 12. Writers can't decide whether they're ripping off Jackie Chan's 'Drunken Master' or every other stereotypical fantasy film in history. 13. The characters are disagreeable and are not developed from start to finish. 14. The fact that Disney decided that the titanic needed a sequel is the one thing more ridiculous than the claim that anyone involved in the creation this film actually read the source material. 15. How is Tom the Seventh Son when he has at least one sister rendering him at best the sixth son. 16. Is the only person who cares that Tom's mum died Tom? I mean we only see her three times in the film and in one of those scenes she's already carked it. 17. Tom and Alice's love 'story' is less of a story and only slightly less shallow than 50SOG. 18. Everyone is useless at fighting until the last scene... convenient. 19. Instead of employing people who appreciate the source material they seemingly employed a 13 year old boy as casting director who promptly cast the first two women who looked good in a low cut neckline into the roles of two witches (who in the books are vile complex creatures hundred of years old in the form of haggard old women). 20. I'm surprised that the creators of Alien haven't sued for a rather 'unique' looking tail that Mother Malkin has. 21. The hero of this film would be better if he was the dragonborn not a Spook because dragons should NOT be in this movie. 22. The special effects are the 2014 equivalent of Eragon's and are overused. 23. This is supposed to be a dark fantasy epic not the middle ages version of Michael Bay's Transformers with characters making as many out-of-character quips and jokes as possible. 24. The USA was not settled in with advanced citadels and cities within the time period of this film and would have been a very basic civilization at the time. 25. They decided to eradicate the individuality of the original story and replace it with a good old 'we have until *insert natural phenomenon here* to defeat *insert name of villain(s) here* story- line 26. I would have snapped the disc of this movie if it hadn't cost me £7. 27. The blurb of this film is so generic reading it made me want to sit and watch Not Another Teen Movie 28. Watching this movie was more disappointing than Assassins Creed 3... yet another thing set in America with generic, dull and one dimensional characters. 29. The magical light bulb in Jeff Bridges' staff is the least lore- friendly thing I've seen since Thomas the Tank Engine in Skyrim. 30. Spooks are against all witches because they use magic ... both Tom and Gregory use magic. 31. This is the least faithful piece of filth to it's source material since Doom (the 2004 movie) and it is appalling that the author of the books (Joseph Delaney) allowed this butchery of something with so much potential.N.B: This is probably a highly bias review due to the fact that I grew up reading these books and was so disappointed with this movie. So whilst I still would actively discourage anybody who has read the books from watching this film I would say that it is suitable for any younger viewers who have not watched many films of this genre.",Seventh Son
212,catcam-54410,Not a happy bunny.,3,17 January 2016,"Having just read all thirteen of the Spooks books, and loved every word, I am disappointed in this film version which has been dumbed down in both plot and characterisation. This could have been a brilliant film, showing shades of good and evil, showing characters with inner depths and divided loyalties, but it is not. It's just another sword and sorcery offering with a tired narrative. It brings nothing new to the genre. The tension, menace and darkness of the books are lost here. What makes the story of Tom Ward so thoroughly enjoyable is the back drop of the dark north west of England landscape full of old legend, terror and harshness. Tom Ward is portrayed as a boy in the books, but is an older youth in the film. This changes the relationship with Alice completely. Less glossy monster scenes and more sustained menace might have improved matters. I think you have done young people a disservice here if you do not think that they can be absorbed by anything other than special affects and zany get outs. You never for one moment worry for Tom, and fear for his life and soul. Such a shame.",Seventh Son
213,briangraydoneverett,Great popcorn fantasy,7,15 March 2018,Just relax and soak this one up. It's fun and not at all as bad as reviews suggest. It reminds me of a time when these movies took themselves less seriously. Good fun. Good hero. Good villain. Good enough FX. Double love stories. Fun action. Pass the popcorn.,Seventh Son
214,mg-22377,A Very Enjoyable Movie,8,10 July 2017,"Unlike some of the other reviewers and critics here, I LIKED THIS MOVIE!It was a good fantasy action film and had a decent story line. By the way, ALL heroic and fantasy stories have been told again and again throughout history. Read Joseph Campbell's and others' works on the mythology of mankind and human archetypes that appear again and again throughout all cultures from the Mahabharata, to the Norse legends like Beowulf, to the Lord of the Rings, to Star Wars, to Asian sword movies to many classic American Westerns. The same themes play out, so it always seems rather shallow of reviewers to pan a production for using a classic plot line. This movie had good character interplay (partly thanks to an excellent cast!), it had good action, and in general IT WAS A GOOD AND VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE. Could it have been better? Probably, but that was not the actors' faults, and I found the parts of the main characters, Gregory, Tom, Alice, Mam Ward, and Mother Malkin, all well delivered and with more depth than they were given credit for. Could there have been more character development? Certainly, if you wanted a 3 or 4 hour movie. Movies by their very nature have to pack a lot into a limited amount of time.There were a number of twists in the story I liked, and some details it took multiple viewings to notice, e.g. Alice wandering at the edge of the crowd when Gregory and Tom first arrive at the walled city, and the guy with shaved head and heavy earrings outside the tavern as Gregory enters shortly after their arrival, then he cropped up later to confirm seeing the Spook (Gregory) enter the tavern when Tom announced he was Master Gregory's apprentice as he rescued Alice from the mob. Some scenes just flit by quickly and without enough emphasis to make an impression, then they are subtly referenced later. Watching the ""making of"" features, I realized a great deal of thought went into this by the creative and production staff. I was truly sorry it was not received better or more of a financial success.Special effects and cinematography were very good, as was costuming and attention to technical details in clothing, weapons, and even buildings. My only gripe in these details might be that a number of time periods and cultural intersections seem to have been conflated to create crowds and city populations, even technologies, that I seriously doubt ever coexisted. However, as this was a fantasy, these peripheral characters added some interesting complexity to the crowd scenes.Reading some of the backstory on Wikipedia, I agree with others here that I am amazed (and delighted) this movie made it to the screen in as good a form as it did. With changes in cast, support, and having to work through the special effects house bankruptcy, I would say they did a heroic job turning out a very good movie. I was not even aware of the cinematic release, and I stumbled across a poor copy on YouTube. This prompted me to go buy the DVD, and I am glad I did. Not only was it much better quality and not cropped at the edges like the YT version, but it had some nice bonus features I also enjoyed watching, e.g. the ""making of"" in several facets was best, giving some insight into the creative process, the Legend and Lore of the Seventh Son (not great but passable), and a few entries in the Visual Effects Gallery. If there is a BluRay with even more features, I might pick it up, too. I know I would have paid twice the modest price the DVD cost, which was less than half the price of a movie theater ticket these days.Whenever I read critics picking apart this or other good or just plain enjoyable movies, I am reminded of a definition of ""critic"" I once read: ""A critic is a person who, having no talent of their own, feels eminently qualified to pass judgment on the talent of others."" Take that as you may.",Seventh Son
215,meganfothergill-76333,Would have been better if they stuck to the book.,1,13 May 2018,"Unfortunately I started reading the series of book this movie is based on around 2005-2006, and was horrified to know they were turning it into a movie because it's one of my favourite books of all time. Well they completely ruined it, the only things being true to the books is that the characters of John Gregory, Thomas Ward and Mother Malkin exist, and that the theme of the story is dealing with her once she is freed. Basically everything else is different, down to the characters motivations, backgrounds, and sometimes even very existence (Kit Harrington's character is dead before the book even starts, and he dies to a completely different type of creature). Beyond that the movie is poorly written, badly directed, and lacks the depth of character and lore you find in the book (a 200 page novel for 9-12 year olds, it's not like it's The Stand or some big epic). They could have done so much better, but chose not to for who knows what reasons. TL;DR The movie is probably not worth your time unless you want a very bad LOTR spoof. Go read the book, it'll take you like 2 hours max.",Seventh Son
216,brody-68495,Not impressed,3,15 August 2018,"For someone who was read the books and was waiting for this film to be made, I was sadly disappointed. The main story line of the movie is not coherent with the first book they even add stuff from books further down in the series that shouldn't of been there. They didn't even get some of the characters correct and that was the most disappointing. If you have any curiosity to read the books I urge you to they are ten times better than the movie.",Seventh Son
217,amyparker1983,How to enjoy this obviously bad fantasy movie,7,15 January 2015,"First, have to say, Ben is one of the biggest reasons I bought the ticket. I'm surprised that this guy could keep his beauty for so many years while the others just turn old... Is he really Dorian Gray? 50 RMB for a movie starred by Dorian Gray, I say it worth my money.Second, after watching the trailer, I found this movie is familiar in every single way,especially when you a fantasy RPG gamer. I wanted to find out how much this movie is like Dragon Age and Elder Scroll...Well,IT IS A TOTALLY FANTASY RPG GAME, except you can't can control them at all. Where is my healing spell? Wait, did he just level up? If so, where is the level up music? You will have this kind of thought all the way till the very end of the movie.It's fun, but in another way. Do not take this movie too serious.Fantasy RPG gamers like me will love this movie more than regular movie goers, I suppose.",Seventh Son
