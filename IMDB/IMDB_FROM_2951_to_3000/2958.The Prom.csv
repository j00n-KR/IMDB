0,SnoopyStyle,"""Liberals from Broadway""",2,15 December 2020,"Self-centered Broadway stars, Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep) and Barry Glickman (James Corden), are devastated by their latest review. Barry decides to take on an advocacy issue to raise their profiles. Dee Dee, Barry, Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells), and chorus girl Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman) descend upon Edgewater, Indiana to fight for lesbian teen Emma Nolan (Jo Ellen Pellman) and her right to take her girlfriend to the prom. Tom Hawkins (Keegan-Michael Key) is the supportive principal. Mrs. Greene (Kerry Washington) is the opposing head of the PTA.Liberals from Broadway are the worst. That's how this Ryan Murphy movie starts. They are the most annoying characters. It may work on Broadway as irony but it's off-putting on film. It's meant as a joke but it's utterly unfunny. There is some controversy about Corden playing a gay character. I have a bigger problem with the way he's playing the character. I don't want to hate on the man but I hate his character. He is both too light for the comedy and too self-concerned for the appeal. The turn with his parents is diminished and I don't want him doing this.While I don't hate musicals, it's not my favorite genre. I don't particularly like any of these songs and quite frankly, I don't remember them a few hours afterwards. This movie is way too long at over two hours. Ryan could easily cut out a couple of the songs. I wish that he would cut out the entire Broadway group and hand this story to the kids. I guess that's not the objective. The objective is for liberals from Broadway to force their way into the kids' story and make themselves the story.",The Prom
1,mark.waltz,A big bundle of heart is what we need now...and forever.,9,14 December 2020,"Having seen this on Broadway three times from different angles to get the full perspective of one of the most original new musicals in quite a while (not based on a movie or a catalog of someone's songs), I was quite delighted that this was quickly chosen to be made into a movie. Not many musicals are filmed within five years of its Broadway run, let alone two.Two years ago, the Macy's Day Parade scored a victory for gay people by showing two young women romantically kiss. The show had an extraordinarily talented ensemble led by Beth Leavel and Brooks Ashmanakas whom I suppose outside of Broadway didn't mean box office.So who to cast? Who else gets to play the top stage roles on film? Why Meryl Streep of course and if she's not exactly in the league of Leavel as a belter, Meryl equals her with a commanding presence and manages to make the egotistical Dee Dee Allen still as big as she was on stage yet show those human elements to make her not a complete monster even in her most self centered moments. Her Dee Dee could easily have been a variation of Madeline Ashton from ""Death Becomes Her"", and there's not one sign of the star of that musical version of ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" present.As for James Corden, he's not among my favorite modern performers, having found Brooks to be completely loveable in everything I've seen him in on stage, but in spite of that found him to be quite a bit more subtle than what I've been lead to believe. He just doesn't have that certain stage bravado that I expected for the role of Barry so it's a slight mismatch for a role that required someone less reserved. His Barry doesn't feel like a big Broadway star who may or may have replaced Nathan Lane in ""The Producers"". He does have a pleasant singing voice, just not Broadway lead quality.While Jo Ellen Pellman, as teenager Emma, certainly can sing and has a nice personality, what she's missing is an edge that someone who's had to defend herself from a bunch of bullies would have. These teenagers, basically nice kids manipulated into being homophobic, are a product of their upbringing, but oh what a lesson that this small town will learn when Streep and Corden arrive in toe with ""Chicago"" chorus girl Nicole Kidman, former sitcom star Andrew Rannels and press agent Kevin Chamberlain.To adapt this to screen, the producers have allowed it to remain nearly 100% faithful to the Broadway show, keeping the score and only making select edits, some for the better. This is still great for everything it is fighting for, whether being acceptance (something that younger generations seem to embrace a bit more) or showing that people can change either through wake-up calls (Barry and Dee Dee), revelations of their own bigotry (Kerry Washington's PTA president) or seeing the world through a bigger light (the young people).In one of the few roles in the show where someone doesn't have a lesson to learn, Keegan-Michael Key is a big ball of heart as the completely accepting principal, aiding Pellman in achieving her desire to go to prom. Flashbacks showing him seeing Dee Dee in her first big show expressed what every Broadway fan feels when that curtain goes up, and that even includes the straight male members of the audience. Kidman and Chamberlain are the others, with Kidman scoring in her big Fosse number. Smaller roles played by Tracey Ullman and Mary Kay Place (not in the stage version) bring on more story perspective.By opening this up to outdoor scenes and sets other than the hotel, the school and the Broadway theaters, this really does indicate the heart that audience members on Broadway saw and brings it to a much larger viewing capacity. This is not for those who hate musicals, or anything that expresses the gooey feeling you get in big brassy numbers on the stage or the rare movie version or anything more accepting out of their own comfort zone. The power of theater rarely transfers over to film, and this one is quite a delight in spite of the magic I felt those three visits to the Longacre Theater and missing Beth and Brooks.",The Prom
2,nogodnomasters,Straight People Like Broadway too,6,11 December 2020,"A group of aging narcissist Broadway actors come to the aid of a small town Indiana girl who recently came out of the closet which cancelled the school's prom.This is not a squeal to anything that starred Jamie Lee Curtis. Based on the Broadway play and has an ""A"" list of stars. The musicals numbers were superb as was Jo Ellen Pellman. I didn't like the religious scene. You really can't debate the Bible in a 3 minute song. I felt the production would have been better served to change the method to convince the students to come around, maybe through self examination of their former relationship with Emma.",The Prom
3,kosmasp,More than a Prom,5,22 March 2021,"Prom - the thing Americans get excited about. Well teenagers and of course especially those who get to go there. There are certain aspects of the prom that may feel outdated. I won't say that about the movie, but there are certain aspects and cliches that some may describe that way too.Seeing the rating here, confirms that I am not alone on my feelings about this. Although I reckon, the more slack you are giving musicals the better you will be entertained by this. Even for those who like them though, I feel they might not have this as their favorite movie of all times either. For a second my cynic inner self was thinking about calling this last years Cats ... but since I haven't seen that (alleged) debacle yet, it would be unfair on many levels to do so.The one common thing they have is James Corden. But I only mention that, to make clear I have nothing against him. Quite the opposite, a lovely soul and a really funny talk show host. And surely not his fault this lacks in many departments (no pun intended)",The Prom
4,lee_eisenberg,So is it OK for celebs to draw attention to issues?,9,16 December 2020,"I haven't seen a stage production of ""The Prom"", but the movie addresses homophobia as well as the problem of celebrities trying to champion political causes (especially when they don't understand the complexities). The original musical was based on an instance in Mississippi in 2010, when a girl wanted to bring her girlfriend to the prom, and some celebs rallied around her.Like many of Ryan Murphy's productions - think ""Glee"" - this movie is so over-the-top that it defies reality. Nonetheless, I enjoyed every part of it, particularly the scenes where the celebs got a shock at having to adjust to small-town life. It won't be for everyone, but it's fun enough for its brief running time.",The Prom
5,Calicodreamin,Warms up,5,14 December 2020,"I was a bit hesitant in liking this in the beginning, but definitely warmed up towards the middle. This reads very much like a Broadway musical, snappy tunes and message heavy. Fairly like-able, fun teen lead, adults were okay.",The Prom
6,ferguson-6,Love Thy Neighbor,6,3 December 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. The success of his TV series ""Glee"" and ""American Horror Story"" has delivered Ryan Murphy the creative freedom to explore other projects. This time out he directs the cinema version of a Tony-nominated musical, and blends star power with newcomers in an extravaganza meant to fill the gap left by the darkened stages of Broadway during the pandemic. Created by Jack Viertel, with a book and screenplay from Bob Martin and Chad Beguelin, it's a story of homophobia and narcissism, and the battle to defeat both.Meryl Streep stars as Dee Dee Allen, and along with James Corden as Barry Glickman, their opening night exuberance for ""Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical"" fades quickly when the reviews hit. Licking their wounds at Sardi's, the two are told by the producer that nobody likes narcissists. Joined by chorus girl Angie Dickinson (played by Nicole Kidman) and Julliard-educated actor/bartender Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells), they decide what's needed to revamp their careers is a 'cause celebre'. Thanks to Twitter trends, they locate the plight of Emma Nolan (newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman), whose Indiana High School PTA has just voted to cancel prom rather than allow Emma to bring another girl as a date.As you would imagine, becoming an activist for the wrong reasons (publicity) can make things messy. These flamboyant city slickers aren't exactly welcomed with open arms by Midwestern folks. Plenty of touching moments occur between Barry and Emma, Barry and Dee Dee, Angie and Emma, Dee Dee and school Principal Mr. Hawkins (Keegan-Michael Key), and mostly, Emma and her closeted girlfriend Alyssa (Ariana DeBose, who will also star in Steven Spielberg's upcoming remake of WEST SIDE STORY). PTA leader and leading homophobe Mrs. Greene (a fiery Kerry Washington) does a nice job as a bigot and caring parent.So while a story exists and messages are conveyed, this is, more than anything, a glitzy musical covered in primary colors as only Ryan Murphy can. Each of our main players gets a featured song, with Ms. Streep's campy ""Not About Me"" a highlight, along with Ms. Kidman's Fosse-esque ""Zazz"". Mr. Corden probably gets more than his fair share of screen time, while Ms. Pellman and Ms. DeBose shine brightly in their numbers, and both possess lovely voices. Young Ms. Pellman is especially impressive holding her own on screen with Oscar winners Streep and Kidman.There likely aren't many gay teen rom-com musicals set in middle-America, especially ones with a Tina Louise reference, but leave it to Ryan Murphy to make it work. There is some quality humor, though it's likely the song and dance segments are what will draw the audience. Choreographer Casey Nicholaw takes full advantage of the athletic youngsters and fills the screens with backflips and leaps - complimenting the dance moves of the stars. It's a shame inclusivity must still be addressed, but at least it can be battled in a fun and colorful way.

7,cherold,"a bit of a mess, but generally fun",7,5 January 2021,"The Prom has a great start, as some narcissistic actors decide to try and help their careers by adopting the cause of an Indiana lesbian's battle to take her date to her high school prom (based on a notorious real-life incident in Mississippi). There are bright, witty songs, energetic performances (Meryl Streep is particularly good), and a pleasantly mild cynicism.Unfortunately the movie proves unable to hold a consistent tone or create reasonable character arcs. While the premise seems to be that these actors come in and make a mess, they truth is they seem generally irrelevant, causing neither harm nor good. And the amusing self-centeredness just seems to fade away as the show moves into sentimentalism.I think the first really weak moment is this weird love-song to Broadway. It's a boring song and also one of these artists-praising-their-own-importance moments that the movie initially mocks. This, like the cheap potshots at ""hick"" Indiana, suggest a certain insufferableness in the authors. The series also sometimes plunges into dreary sentimentality, particularly with James Corden, who moves between the polls of ""fun gay guy"" and ""bitter gay guy"" without finding the connection between them.Much of the emotion in the movie feels manipulative. Only Jo Ellen Pellman seems able to portray sadness subtly and convincingly.One suspects the all-star cast is less than the Broadway originals. Nicole Kidman plays a genial chorus girl but it's clear she can't actually dance (her one musical number involves sashaying powered by the magic of film editing), and that seems like an odd choice.At it's best, the show is funny and clever and fun. When it's not, it's still well meaning, with a message about tolerance that, while simplistic, is always a good thing to push. But I feel this could have been much better than it was, and perhaps a bit shorter.",The Prom
8,Cineanalyst,Narcissistic,3,12 December 2020,"""The Prom"" begins cleverly enough with the play-within-the-play starring self-righteous, narcissistic hacks. They laughably sing about their power to change the world. After a bad review, they decide to double down and take their supposedly world-changing song-and-dance numbers to saving a lesbian teenager in Indiana. It's amusing enough to see Meryl Streep bursting in on a small Midwestern town's PTA meeting belting out lyrics about how her singing isn't about her. It's a ridiculous caricature of oblivious coastal celebrity elites lecturing bigoted middle America. A FoxNews nightmare--the Broadway/Hollywood liberals coming to corrupt the children's prom. Panic! The movie's message of inclusivity is admirable, too, if heavy-handed and the picture generally overlong. Yet, it turns out, this first act wasn't a joke at all. The rest of the movie is the same obnoxious nonsense as the Eleanor Roosevelt musical. Ryan Murphy and company's featherbrained idealism once again reduce social problems to black-and-white issues to be solved by corny and monotonous speechifying and auto-tune. They are the narcissists.Murphy did the same thing with his prior Netflix project, ""Hollywood,"" bowdlerizing history to pretend that had there been some brave people who spoke up that racism and homophobia would've been conquered in 1940s America. Not only laughably stupid, but insulting to those who really did speak up and those who suffered from bigotry. ""Hollywood"" started off rather well, too, by equating acting to prostitution, but, then, it never really got to the acting part. At least, ""The Prom"" isn't set in the past and any lip syncing isn't as atrocious as in a ""Glee"" episode, although it's instead about the most frivolous thing in the world, proms. According to Murphy, he still thinks he's making an old-fashioned musical film instead of another iteration of ""High School Musical"" (2006)--no, really, he compared ""The Prom"" to ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952). To the contrary, every song here sounded the same to me; it's awful. Same auto-tuned, singing-and-dancing lecture in unison to the same melody--every time, over and over again. ""Singin' in the Rain"" made fun of the transition from silent films to talkies, but it didn't follow that up with the rest of the movie being as bad as the movies they made fun of. Plus, the singing and dancing was delightful and variegated.Besides reducing discrimination of homosexuals to self-centered fluff, Murphy's formula is also terribly cloying. Pathetic TV, tear-jerker melodramatics. Make sure you give all the main characters a prize at the end and that everybody declares their affection for one another. The bigots, too, learn their lessons. Grab the tissues or barf bags. What a waste of the talents of Streep and Nicole Kidman, among others.",The Prom
9,Thanos_Alfie,Change...,5,1 March 2021,"""The Prom"" is a Drama - Musical movie in which we watch two self-obsessed theater stars trying to help a high-school girl going with her girlfriend to the prom. They have to change their behaviors and truly help the girl if they want to change as persons.I liked this movie because it presented very well a serious social topic from different perspectives while it consisted of some sarcastic scenes about celebrities and famous people in general. The interpretations of both Meryl Streep who played as Dee Dee Allen and James Corden who played as Barry Glickman were very good and they both did a very good job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jo Ellen Pellman's who played as Emma Nolan and Keegan-Michael Key's who played as Principal Tom Hawkins and they were equally good. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Prom"" was not exactly what I was expecting but I have to admit that was good and I recommend everyone to watch it.",The Prom
10,cruise01,"Flashy, fun, and overlong.",6,2 January 2021,3 out of 5 stars.The Prom is a fair musical drama film that follows Emma (Jo Ellen Pelmen) who cant bring her girlfriend to Prom. School board cancelled prom and refused to accept that she is a lesbian. Broadway actors played by James Corden. Meryl Streep. Nicole Kidman. And Andrew Rannells. All step in to give Emma a prom and make it a night to remember.Fun plot about self love. And accepting everyone for who they are from race to sexuality. Fun meaning with the story.The cast ensemble is great. The musical sequences have some pretty decent set pieces. Some good songs. And some forgettable.I did find the direction to be a little too long at parts. Could have been trimmed like 15 mins from the run time. With some characters going on for too long with there backstory.It is a decent musical that is fun to watch.,The Prom

The celebs decide to 'help'.Essentially a long episode of Glee with one belt it out loud number after another. Whilst this is a bit of a swipe at homophobic small town America and hammers inclusion, not very subtly throughout, there is plenty to enjoy here if you can swallow the schmaltz and a plot like a Mickey Rooney / Judy Garland musical. Streep inevitably walks away with this - very nearly, as Corden is at his best (frankly not that hard) and they both perform some impressive numbers and happily send themselves up leading to both funny lines and some convincing drama, mainly from Corden. It could probably have been15 minutes shorter and Kidman seems quite out of place, otherwise it's fun, undemanding musical stuff.",The Prom
14,yusufpiskin,too cheesy,2,21 December 2020,"Pretty typical and brings nothing new to these sorta films, but it still has more to it than I was expecting.I had predicted it was going to be a full-on forced comedy and cringe teen romance, but it actually has a little bit more substance to it. Added to the fact that none of the cast irritated or annoyed me, which is always a positive. You can guess what's coming up from minute one, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it - albeit to a minor degree.Aimee Teegarden (Nova) and Thomas McDonell (Jesse) are a decent enough pairing, while the characters of Danielle Campbell (Simone) and Joe Adler (Rolo) are more interesting than they seemed to be early on. Dean Norris, midway through 'Breaking Bad' at this point in his career, also appears.'Prom' may have absolutely nothing special about it and is very plain, but I'd very much be lying if I said I disliked it to be honest. It's passable.",The Prom
15,aidanratesmovies,"Not as horrible as some may say, although far from great",7,6 February 2021,"Its wonderfully shot, and decently entertaining- even for its overlong runtime- but sadly The Prom at times can feel a bit too shallow to deal with the issues it so boldly thinks it's solving. Being a member of the LGBTQ+ group, I find it refreshing to see such a blatant display of rights of everyday people on film like this. However, the film just sadly isn't as magical as it thinks it is. I'll start with the flaws, that being the films large dose of overacting celebrities in the limelight. I get that they are trying to be cheeky, but the performances feel too forced at times, and the characters quite overdone. Stereotypes and cliches aside, the film also just feels too corny at times to truly take it seriously. It nails messages and situations at hand at times, but it can never truly deal with those conversations, or follow through with them, as it great as they start. The film has a variety of catchy tunes, nothing special, but they'll stick in your head for a little while. You care about the girl at hand, which I feel is largely why some of the film works as much as it does, and I enjoyed how they dealt with her character in the long run. The costumes and look of the film are fantastic, and at times it can put a smile on your face. In the end, The Prom ids nothing to gush about, but it's a fine musical, fine adaptation, and fine film for everyone to enjoy.

16,dierregi,Musicals are outdated,1,19 December 2020,"Musicals - and westerns - are very American genres. Neither works well abroad and should have been put to rest, with very few exceptions. This is not one of them, but just another patronising Netflix flick.Not being interested in Broadway musicals, I had no idea of what this movie was about, but I discovered it quickly and to my disappointment. Here we go again with sequins and silly songs that try desperately to be relevant, being sung by the likes of Streep and Kidman. Unfortunately, it looks like both are going down the De Niro way, playing whatever part for the paycheck. Good for them and for me, taking full advantage of my freedom to zap away.",The Prom

Newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman and Ariana DeBose play the couple in question, but the PTA led by Alyssa's mother, played by Kerry Washington, decides to shut down the prom instead as they can't bother to have gay students at the prom. Upon hearing this news, four Broadway actors played by Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Rannells, and James Corden decide to swoop in and save the day in an attempt to re-invigorate their middling careers.The film boasts a massive cast and everyone gets their chance to shine. This marks the third movie musical for Nicole Kidman who gets the fun Fosse filled number ""Zazz"" Meryl Streep is perfect casting as the narcissistic Broadway diva Dee Dee Allen. She has the playful humor down pat with the number ""It's Not About Me"" and ""The Lady's Improving"" Keegan-Michael Key is a fun surprise too as the high school principal who has a crush on Meryl's character.Of the high-profile leads, the casting of James Corden is complicated. He can play and sing the part without question, but I'd rather have an openly gay actor play the openly gay character. There's a needed authenticity that Corden can't naturally have with his character. The real soul and power of this story comes down to the star making performances from Jo Ellen Pellman and Ariana DeBose. Both are so cute together and will have huge futures ahead of them.There is so much heart poured into The Prom that its hard to not have a good time and be moved to tears afterwards with its messages. Expectations are key to enjoying it.

18,jadepietro,The Party's Over,6,12 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: Dubious casting and bad direction take some of the fizz out of this effervescent Broadway musical about intolerance and homophobia.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Critics were decidedly mixed with a love-it-or-hate-it attitude to Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of the Broadway hit, The Prom. I did thoroughly enjoy the live production on stage with its talented cast, good score, and flashy dancing. It was a enchanting romp about intolerance ala Hairspray. And it is hard not to compare these ""then"" and ""now"" versions of the same musical. (Decidedly, Broadway wins!) This movie adaptation is still lively, but it is also heavy-handed and preachy. However, there is still much to enjoy in this diverting movie.The gist of the film is a musical romp that deals with homophobia. A idealistic teenager wants to take her girlfriend to the prom and faces prejudice head-on. Her protests becomes a cause for some out-of-work actors who come to the town to support her cause and gain some needed publicity.Ryan Murphy directs and he does open up his film to avoid theatrical excesses, but he stages his performers in realistic setting that dwarf them and make the musical elements all the more jarring. Add to that, the film's lousy photography and editing that seriously hampers Casey Nicholaw's energetic choreography, with too many close-up and faraway shoots that always cut off the dancing from the knees down. Not the best approach for a musical and Mr. Murphy should know better. (The usually reliable cinematographer Matthew Libatique does his weakest work here and Peggy Tachdjian and Danielle Wang abet his musical crime.) As with the original production, the songs are solid, if not truly memorable, but they do advance the story well.The screenplay by the original Broadway writing team, Chad Beguelin and Bob Martin, remains mostly the same as the play although some dramatic additions to the plot (plus Mr. Murphy. To his credit, the filmmaker does try to bring in some diversity in his casting by giving some Black and Asian actors supporting roles in his film.So let's talk casting. The original Broadway cast soared. It's a shame that Hollywood rarely allows the talented stage performers to reprise their roles. Instead they seek out bigger names to substitute in order to lure moviegoers into the theaters, or nowadays, streaming into your home. And that again is the case here...with decidedly mixed results.The roles played by Tony nominated Beth Leavel, Brooks Ashmanskas, and the talented belter, Caitlin Kinnunen as Emma, the crusading lesbian, were prime examples of Broadway talent enhancing the material. They were all such a delight on stage. Here in moviedom, Mama Streep inherits the showiest role as the narcissistically challenged DeeDee Allen, and she is charming, a close second to Ms. Leavel. The remaining cast members never reach her level of zaniness, although Mr. Conden playing Barry Glickman, the swishy queen diva, comes close. Less than solid support is given by Andrew Rannells as Trent Oliver and Nicole Kidman as Angie. Their second banana comic status proves to be challenging. Newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman is a fine choice as our plucky heroine and Keegan-Michael Key as DeeDee's love interest has a nice chemistry with Ms. Streep. Kerry Washington and Kevin Chamberlin are wasted in their still sketchy and throwaway parts.The Prom loses its ""zazz"" as it hits home its positive message of tolerance. It is high-spirited entertainment, but you might want to sit this one out. Just where are those jazz hands when you need them? (GRADE: C+)",The Prom

20,LeonardKniffel,Musical Delight Padded with Sanctimoniousness,8,4 January 2021,"This lavish adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name has much to recommend it, especially the more than 20 delightful songs that fill its 130 minutes. Watching a stellar cast that includes Meryl Streep and Keegan-Michael Key as an item is just fun. Although they are so watchable, it is Carrie Washington who steals the show as a homophobic mom. The song lyrics are wonderfully satirical and clever and take potshots at bigotry and egomania with equal delight, but what lessens the impact of the fun is the tendentious, sanctimonious, sentimental preaching that goes on between every song. At whom are these anti-homophobia sermons aimed, when the film is clearly preaching to the choir? It is also interesting to note that in this integrated Indiana town, where no racial prejudice appears to exist, there is no mention of how the town entered this state of perfect harmony while remaining virulently intolerant of gay people. It's all in good fun and does raise one's spirits, but from it I did take some life lessons, and I do have a few suggestions for teens struggling with their homosexuality: #1 Do not ""come out,"" especially in high school. #2 Do not explain your sexuality to your parents. It's none of their business. Go live your life and never apologize, never explain. #3 Do not attend a high school prom. They are antiquated heterosexual courting rituals, no matter how many flashing lights and how much loud music. #4 No amount of razzmatazz can change the fact that, in addition to ""who you love,"" your sexuality is about sex and sex is the business of consenting adults in private.",The Prom

22,saadgkhan,Meryl and Nicole made it little less torturous,3,14 December 2020,"The Prom - C (Mediocre)Too many songs, and sluggish pace and mediocre songs can give you a headache at times. I had to mute multiple times or fast tracked songs especially featuring the young lead actress. She was painful to watch, always gleeful even in more serious situations. You barely think she suffered because she is always super cheerful. Who talks like that, with mouth wide open in a grin all the time. Also forcing her girlfriend to come out of closet relentlessly when she is not ready. I bet in Real life Emma there must be heartening story but unfortunately in this Emma they're unable to find it. I was very disconnected to her motives because she wants a prom dance she should have it eventhough her girlfriend is not ready for big comeout infront of whole school, friends and her mom. Not sure why almost 25+ And 30 years old girls are playing teenagers.Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman made it possible for me to push through this mediocre songs's bonanza. Soo many songs after songs after songs and sung even more painfully by character actors. Also the whole controversy about James Corden playing a homosexual is ridiculous, isn't for years str8 actors Sean Pean, Hilary Swank, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Laura Dern, Felicity Hoffman and Jared Leto etc broke the bearers and made ways for LGBTQ+ Characters to get mainstream attention and respect. An actor should be able to play anything even a tree as Scarlet Johansson once said.Why actors personal life and preference matters, lot of actors don't want their personal life in limelight. So, it means they should not even audition for these roles because they are not bold enough to comeout of closet. This shows the narrow mindset of current Cancel Culture, we have a bold mediocre maybe but still a movie like that and instead they pick on why they cast James Corden in it.

Everyone is down from the years events and the pandemic and the holidays seem to be a bust. So here comes Ryan Murphy's joyous old school musical based on the broadway show. Featuring a barrage of wonderful stars. The film centers on a young gay woman whose not being allowed to fully participate in her prom by the PTA. So some broadway celebrities with bad pr travel to the town to rectify the situation for some supposed selfless headlines. The movie is just a blast of positive energy with great performances by Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Randall, Michael Keegan, newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman and most surprisingly James Gorden who delivers a wonderful and engaging performance. Directed with creative zest by Ryan Murphy of Glee and American Horror Story. The film features dazzling choreography, a great soundtrack and wonderful musical numbers. I wish I could have seen this in theaters but it's still an amazing cinematic experience. It's funny and sad and it's just the experience we need right now. An energetic, inspired, campy, fun explosion of epic proportions. One of the best films of the year.****.5/5",The Prom
24,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Fun and catchy, even with a dated moral lesson.",7,18 February 2021,"I enjoy a good musical like the rare heterosexual man I am (played in the movie by Keegan-Michael Key), and The Prom (2020) scratched that itch for me this year. I enjoyed its self-aware first act, even if the overall plot seemed like it was about 10 years too late to be relevant. And while many of the story beats were either predictable or cliche, there were a few moments of rare depth that felt genuine, even if they broke the facade of the whimsical characters that had filled the first two acts.There's something about narcissistic Broadway types having to interact with the midwest that was entertaining to me. Much of this film's humor revolves around how out-of-step with the rest of the country these east coast elites are-even if it's far from realistic (I hope). Of note, a few of the songs are quite exceptional, including ""It's Not About Me"" and ""Love Thy Neighbor,"" the latter of which certainly hits a chord in this post-Christian era. Unfortunately, for a musical filled with plenty of songs, those were the only two that stuck out to me.While I understand film adaptations of Broadway musicals lag by quite a few years, this story's overarching moral seemed dated, even by 2020 standards. I'm sure these problems still plague high schools in the midwest, but there have been better movies to present this kind of story in a deeper way that didn't feel quite like an after-school special. Perhaps the reason for this out-of-touch feel is how hard The Prom leans into LGBTQ+ stereotypes to get their point across. I think the audience would have appreciated a little more nuance, even if it could have diverged from the original musical.Fun and catchy, even with a dated moral lesson, I give The Prom 3.5 stars out of 5.",The Prom

27,tm-sheehan,Ignore the negative press The Prom is Joyful,8,12 December 2020,"My Review
The Prom- my rating 8/10
The Prom is a joyous celebration of music and choreography with a strong message that shows the trauma and rejection many LGBTQI youngsters in school go through because of prejudice and ignorance .
Sound a bit bleak and heavy ? Well it's the opposite it's bright and colourful and overflowing with some of the best talent on screen today.
Film Musicals often get a tough time from the critics just look how they blasted ""Cats"" last year and that also featured great talent including James Corden who is quite brilliant in ""The Prom.""
I've already read some very negative reviews saying things like describing The Prom as Ryan Murphy's inconsistent musical and criticism of James Corden a straight actor cast as a flamboyant gay man .
I'm a lover of musicals and have been all my life and I appreciate an enjoyable entertaining musical when I see one.
The Prom as you may have read is loosely based on a true story
Perhaps the most notable incident took place in 2010, when the Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Miss., refused to let high school senior Constance McMillen and her girlfriend attend the prom as a couple. ... In response, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the school district.
The original stage musical The Prom made its world premiere at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia in 2016 and premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre in October 2018.
It was a critical and audience success and won The Drama Desk Award for Outstanding musical.
Frank Rizzo, writing for Variety wrote that ""with a tuneful score, a playful book, and performances that remind you what Broadway heart and chutzpah are all about, this cause celebre of a show turns out to be a joyous, funny, and sweet production that should appeal to several generations of musical fans.""
I haven't seen the Stage version but I agree 100% with Frank Rizzo's comments.
The plot is simple basically it's about a troupe of hilariously self-obsessed theater stars who swarm into a small conservative Indiana town in support of a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to the prom.
What a great cast in the film as these troupe of actors who's careers are starting to fade . They converge on Edgewater High to help Emma Nolan in a bid for good publicity to help their careers.
Meryl Streep as Dee Dee Allen a narcissistic and egotistical star is brilliant , her showstopper ""It's Not About Me"" is a vampy hymn about ego disguised as humility.
Then we have her co star on stage James Corden who I really admire in this performance as actor singer dancer in The Prom .James Corden is a true musical performer as he proved in ""Into the Woods.""
Nicole Kidman is also wonderful as Fosse Girl Angie Dickinson she has a great number in that Fosse style channeling the late Original star of Chicago Gwen Verdon.
Andrew Rannells as Trent Oliver faded young Soapey star is also good fun .
The star that impressed me most in The Prom is 24 year old Jo Ellen Pellman as Emma Nolan the young woman who wants to take her girl to The Prom.
I've seen Jo Ellen before in The Marvelous Mrs Maisel but in The Prom she reminds me of a cross between a young Anne Hathaway and Elisabeth Moss , my prediction is that we are going to see much more of JoEllen Pellman.
Summing up The Prom I'll just say if you don't like musicals you probably won't like The Prom but watch it anyway just for the message of acceptance and open mindedness and the talent .
It has some very good songs by composer Matthew Sklar and David Klotz and great dance numbers . If you enjoyed the series Glee which Ryan Murphy the Director of The Prom wrote you'll enjoy this movie.
I hope I get to see it where it should be seen on a giant cinema screen.",The Prom

29,msbreviews,THE PROM is a massively insulting disaster...,3,30 December 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I really love musicals, but Netflix's attempt at a cheerful, joyful, colorful, and culturally significant film turns out to be one of the most cringe-worthy, awfully stereotypical, ridiculously exaggerated movies of the year. From the astoundingly over-the-top (and honestly, somewhat insulting) performance from James Corden and Jo Ellen Pellman's one-dimensional debut to the contradictory narrative, Ryan Murphy's first feature film since 2010's Eat, Pray, Love is a massive disappointment.The Prom is supposed to celebrate equality by supporting an inclusive prom where everyone can go and feel comfortable being themselves. However, it restrains itself from showing a homosexual kiss or really any sort of intimacy, leaving that to the very last second of the movie, but it doesn't have any problems in fully developing a heterosexual relationship meanwhile. The breaking out into songs (which are a bit too many) mostly feels incredibly forced, making the whole film look more like a collection of sketches than an actual movie.A few excellent performances (Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Rannells, Keegan-Michael Key), a couple of quite entertaining musical numbers, some nice choreography and camera work (Matthew Libatique), and an admittedly ambitious production design save this film from being a complete trainwreck, but it's still a disaster.Rating: D+",The Prom

31,Alexander_Blanchett,Fine musical - Glee style,7,18 December 2020,"It takes a while to get used to the style of the film and the characters but if you take that time its worth it. At the beginning it all appears a bit irritating, cartoonish and fast spirited. But the more we get to know the characters and their conflicts the more interesting it gets,
I am also always a bit divided on Ryan Murphy. As a creator and creative mind I love him, as a director he rarely meets my expectations of good quality direction. This is no difference. The actors however make up for this. Meryl Streep is really good and developes her character quite well but you wouldn't expect less. Its not an Oscar worthy performance but I am sure she will become a Golden Globe front runner once again. James Corden is really annoying at first but also developes his character so well that he ends up giving a really good performance. Nicole Kidman is rather wasted. She has her Roxie Hart moment but other than that sadly rather forgettable. The young girl who gave her debut performance Jo Ellen Pellman is very good and so is Ariana DeBose. Kerry Washington was very stereotyped and never got out of this. Keegan-Michael Key is very smyphatic. Most of the songs were very good, the chereopgraphies mix between amateurish and very professional and entertaining. The look was nice. All in all a good light entertainment film with a strong message. Worth for the cast. Always nice to hear Meryl Streep singing.",The Prom

Director: Ryan Murphy
Starring: Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Cordon, Keegan Michael Key, Kerry Washington, Andrew Rannells, Ariana DeBose, Jo Ellen Pellman etcOverall rating 31/100The prom is about a group of self obsessed narcissistic theatre stars who travel to the conservative state of Indiana, in support of a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to prom. Apart from a few sweet moments and fun distractions the prom was absolutely terrible, missing in the mark in so many different aspects, so lets get started.I am going to be nice and start with a few positives. Its cinematography was good and the soundtrack was great. The movie did look visually fantastic, with breathtaking set locations and costume designs, and provide a good visual distraction from the movie. The Soundtrack was also fantastic. There was some fantastic songs in the movie that were very catchy and took you into a different world distracting you from the movie itself which provided some moments of greatness, with great vocal performances from the cast.However. My first few negatives would be the rushed beginning with no background or development, the offensive LGBTQ casting, the lack of convincing conflict, and the poor set up making most of the characters very unlikeable. I thought the movie had a very rushed beginning which didn't make a lot of sense, the movie just started straight away with the main set up for the movie of the main character not being allowed to the prom, without one single bit of development or background into the plot or any of the characters, the movie was just expecting you to know what was going on and care about the characters straight away and it didn't work. I also found the casting of James Corden terrible and offensive. No offense to James I do like him as a talk show host, but not as an actor. A straight man playing a gay character like this was a very poor decision, James's performance was very bad and offensive to the community that the movie is trying to represent. I also thought that there was a complete lack of convincing conflict throughout most of the movie. The conflict just lacked any form of believability and it just made the cast of theatre performers seem even more self obsessed and unlikeable, none of the conflict was very convincing and it just didn't leave any impact. I also thought the set up of the main plot point including all of the characters was poorly done and made most of the characters seem very unlikeable. The main motivation for the characters to help the main character go to her prom, was to get good publicity for themselves, this instantly made them dislikeable and the movie never did enough to convince the audience that they had changed throughout the movie.My next few negatives would be the generic high school formula, bland script and corny tone. The movie followed such a generic high school formula, where there was just a bunch of characters with no personality there to create generic conflict or to reflect a part of society, all following generic and lazy character types that are just boring now. I also thought the script and tone were very corny, there was so many generic lines of dialogue that were so cringy and poorly executed by a lot of characters it really dragged this movie down, for a movie with these kinds of themes the script needed to be a lot more powerful and heartfelt than what it actually was.My final few positives would be the performances from Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman, some decent character conflict for the main character, and a partly heartwarming ending portraying the representation and the themes of the movie well. Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman made the movie for me, Meryl as expected was fantastic her performance was fun and charming, her musical numbers were fantastic and she stole the show every time she was on the screen, Nicole Kidman also did this for me, she was criminally underused for the movie but seemed the most actually genuine character in the movie and her musical numbers were also fantastic. I thought that there was some decent character conflict for the main character, the concept of the school making a fake prom for the main character, it fitted with the theme of the movie and the isolation for the main character, making the leaders of the prom committee very unlikeable. I also thought the ending was heartwarming and was the one place in the movie where it portrayed the themes and representation of the movie well, having a prom where everyone is accepted and the admittedly powerful musical number was excellent, everyone was accepted and it really showed a positive representation and portrayed the themes well, its just a shame that this was not executed throughout the whole movie.My final few negatives would be the movie playing it safe with its LGBTQ themes, lack of character depth, odd narrative structure and inconsistent with character screen time and its structure. The movie played it way to safe with its LGBTQ issues and themes, this movie had such a big importance on acceptance and different peoples experiences, it had hardly any of that, There was teased moments with the main character and her parents but it was never included and the stupid insults made the film feel very unprofessional and it just didn't handle or execute these themes or the proper representation for most of the movie. There was also a complete lack of character depth for any of the characters, the movie just thought having one moment of some form of depth ordevelopment or depth was enough to carry the movie it wasn't, the attempts at death was largely just exposition and long pieces of dialogue, the main character completely lacked depth, she wasn't in the movie enough, and she felt more like a plot device for the theme of the movie than an actual person or character. I also thought the narrative structure was bad and poor, the movie had its climax randomly in the first quarter of the film, and then a very slow build to another climax with the different prom, this really effected the movies pacing and dragged the movie down a lot. And finally there was inconsistent character screen time with the structure, The movie didn't have a clue how long to have each character in the movie, it was completely messy and messed up the pacing and how much we cared for the characters, most of them just had a couple of scenes and then it moved onto someone else.Overall, apart from some visual appeal, some good songs, Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep and some good representation towards the end, The prom has nothing, and did nothing for me, lacking the believability and authenticity that this kind of movie needs, also with poorly constructed plot and characters that lacked any notable development or depth.",The Prom

I enjoyed it's painting of celebrities as these vain people who only think of their brand, even when they are trying to ""make a change"". This is all emphasized by the hyper glossy style. Think Greatest Showman but everything is more thought out. Where it lacks is in some performances, inconsistent at best musical numbers, and some questionable editing/structure choices. I realize the big names demand screen time, but it's not their story. They should've been relegated to the sidelines, allowing us to get more acquainted with the main character.

41,danybur,A well-intentioned but somewhat outdated musical,6,13 December 2020,"Ryan Murphy offers us a well-meaning and optimistic message about diversity, homophobia and inclusion (his usual themes) but through a somewhat old-fashioned musical, both in its musical bill and in the ""educational"" way in which addresses those issues. The film works best when it focuses with sharp humor and irony on the vanity of its characters and, last but not least, gives us a new festival of the marvelous Meryl Streep.Two musical comedians, Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman (Meryl Streep and James Corden) are defenestrated by critics after their last Broadway premiere, which they were celebrating in a New York bar. Along with a showgirl, Angie Dickinson (sic) (Nicole Kidman) and the bartender of the place and also an actor ""on hiatus"" Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells) find out that in a conservative town in conservative Indiana the parents' meeting of a school He decides to suspend his graduation dance (the Title Prom) to prevent a lesbian student, Emma Nolan (Jo Ellen Pellman) from attending it with her girlfriend. The comedian quartet decides to travel to Indiana to defend Emma's cause and thus regain notoriety and prestige.We could place El baile in the subgenre of movies about proms, a true institution of Yankee culture, so it affects rites. A masterpiece of the subgenre would be Carrie, for example.
So there are two thematic lines of this musical comedy: homophobia and the struggle for inclusion on the one hand and narcissism, the selfishness of the stars and their attachment to success, embodied above all in Dee Dee and to a lesser extent in Barry.Regarding the first, the film is a well-intentioned but somewhat exhausting permanent down-line on the right to diversity, in favor of inclusion and against homophobia, faced with unchanging seriousness or sentimentality. Instead, the best moments of the film are when he humorously describes the vanity of the characters. They could have included fewer ""educational"" songs and more songs by the villains and introduced more disagreements or nuances into the group of ""good guys"".The songs: the songs sung by comedians fit in with the emphatic and bombastic (and somewhat old-fashioned) style of classical musical comedy that works best with irony. The songs of Emma and her girlfriend have a more modern and pop nuance, but up there.The dances: it shows off an epileptic and overly edited choreography.The cast: the film includes perhaps the two greatest Hollywood divas. The one that saves the film is the marvelous performance of Meryl Streep: she sings excellently well, she again shows herself as an absolute comedy dominator, her character is the only one who presents some folds and contradictions and at the age of 70 she shows energy and her usual magnetism. The wasted Nicole Kidman gets a fairly minor character, a loser. As always, she does it well. The most sentimental character is that of Corden, who as an actor is quite bland. The girls sing well. Emma's girlfriend Alyssa (Ariana DeBose) is a reincarnation of Leah Michelle.Watching this film, we come to understand that the universe of its director, Ryan Murphy, the exasperated style in which she frames all her fictions, is that of the musical.",The Prom
42,Michael Fargo,Should you see this? Yes. Is it very good? No.,6,13 December 2020,"Frighteningly miscast (Mr. Corden's performance is the least of the objectionable performances here; Joe Ellen Pellman as Emma and Andrew Rannells seem to be the only ones in on the ""joke"" that is ""The Prom."" On the stage, this is a gentle and loving spoof to a formulaic Broadway musical, that gently nudges you in the funny bone, giving you some spectacular choreography, framing a social issue. Ryan Murphy takes something airy and light and jabs you with very sharp elbows in the ribs so that everything quickly becomes bruised and painful.There's no reason for Meryl Streep ever to perform in a musical again. Thank you, this is enough. I feel like she's using her well-deserved fame to weasel into roles that no one would have cast her in if she wasn't Meryl Streep. The use of VFX de-aging on Streep's face is the first sign that choosing her was a mistake. First, she's not that old for this particular role. She just doesn't have the instrument or talent for musical comedy. Ms. Kidman has a sweet, though thin voice, and her ability to dance is...none. Why an A-list actor would take a B-role in a, yes, winning though minor musical, boggles.I'm a little baffled at the heat James Corden has suffered. If anything, I think he plays against the ""swish"" stereotype successful on the stage by the wonderful Barry Ashmanskas. And he's as over-eager here as he is in anything. Did people complain he was ""offensive"" in Carpool Karaoke? I'm not rigid in filming the original Broadway cast in a film adaptation. Often it's not a good idea, but you really want a ""step-up"" in the film version; plus, you have the luxury of picking from anyone you want. This film didn't need this kind of star power to bring in an audience.Based on the true story (along with some other cases) of Constance McMillen, a senior at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Mississippi. The subject material is worth sitting through all the noise and clutter. And while the choreography, the only thing that survives the transition from the Broadway stage to the screen, is as athletic and fun, Murphy doesn't know how to hold his camera still long enough for us to enjoy it. Putting it in actual (and poorly chosen) locations, undermines the fun, a shopping mall being an especially grievous choice.The candy colors and very hard focus of the cinematography distracts from what weight the film has, that is, the bigotry endemic in small Midwestern towns. But it's worth being reminded of the actual event the book is based on. So buy a ticket...and find a YouTube of Beth Leavel's performance on Broadway and see how much we were cheated by not bringing her as well as Brooks Ashmanskas' ""Barry is Going to the Prom.""",The Prom

44,mr_bickle_the_pickle,The Prom fails to dazzle,5,15 December 2020,"The basic premise of the film is that these Broadway actors (who have just had a flop) decide to help out a young girl have the prom of her dreams after its cancelled when she cant bring her girlfriend. It sound nice in theory but truthfully I found the Broadway actors (played by Meryl Streep, James Corden, Nicole Kidman and Andrew Rannells) to be the worst part. Andrew was the only tolerable character in those scenes but overall its played too over the top that it almost comes across as parody. They sing a song early on in the film where ""they have to help the little lesbian because they're thespians"" and I swear it sounded like something you'd hear in The Producers. And the other part of the film (the school side) while being a little cheesy was at least very heartfelt and earnest. So the tone on the Broadway side just didnt always gel. I totally get that they're supposed to be ""out of touch"" and ""dramatic"" because theyre theater actors but its just a bit too OTT. James in particular comes across as very grating as he tries to play very stereotypically gay.I also feel like the film doesnt have a lot of real conflict in it. At the beginning of the film the prom has been completely cancelled over Emma (played by Jo Ellen Pellman) being gay. And shes fighting the PTA over this matter. But as soon as the Broadway actors show up (without them actually doing much) boom prom is back on now. So that conflict is over. The mean popular kids are no longer homophobic because Andrew Rannells sings them a song about how they're hypocritical for cherry picking the bible. Sop that conflict is easily resolved. Not too mention that if all took was to bring up that its also a sin to have a tattoo or get divorced then Im sure there would be no more homophobes in the world. Like, it aint that easy. Kerry Washington plays the pTA ringleader who's trying to stop Emma and the Prom. She also plays the mother of Emma's secret girlfriend. And that could be an interesting thing to explore but they dont really give much between the two characters. And once the daughter finally does confront her mom and tell her shes gay, literally 5 min later in the next scene the mom is all ""I love you"" and she has accepted her. Like everything in this film is wrapped up too neatly in a bow. Im not saying this film has to end dark...I know they want to have the happy ending and thats totally fine...but conflicts are resolved to easily.I've never seen the stage musical so I dont know how it compares. But I feel like this film had the potential to be good. I just think they could have done without the broadway actors storylines...they dont really do much to push the storyline forward anyway.

47,Golden_Hope,Endless...,3,11 December 2020,"I had never heard of this musical before watching. I can say that this film has made me never want to see it.This film has so many issues but Jesus Christ James Corden is on of the main ones. He is unwatchable in this movie. It is honestly so so bad. The accent is so bad but the worst part is the terrible portrayal of a gay man. I think a quote from the movie its self sums this performance up best ' An Insultingly misguided, offensive and laughable performance'. It was painful and embarrassing to watch and it is even worse when on screen with an actual gay man who is just a normal person because it may come as a surprise to James Corden but gay people are just regular people they are not cartoon circus clowns and just spin and clap all day. He also has no emotional range so all of his dramatic scenes fall flat.I found the songs to be grating most of the time and found that they just didn't flow very well. They were all sung sort of out of time with the music it was really strange. I wanted to skip some because they were just boring and really lacklustre. Some were also pretty embarrassing. Especially the ones that come from secondary cast members.The cast was a complete mixed bag. I enjoyed Meryl for the most part, i think because you could tell that she was just having a good time with the character. I think that Jo Ellen Pellman was pretty good however i did find that sometimes when she was sad it just didn't read she looked like she was smirking or about to giggle. I think Nicole Kidman was the biggest waste of money and talent in this movie. She is so good but she was just completely wasted in this movie. She is hardly in it and just does nothing. When she gets her moment it is really interesting and i would have appreciated more time with her character.The message of this film is really good and really important but it is so heavy handed.I sort of liked the sets so there is one thing.I would honestly skip this its a huge waste of money and it is never ending. It felt like it dragged on for 4 hours.",The Prom
48,gpxdlr,I Didn't Go To My PROM either,7,12 December 2020,"I enjoyed this film. It made me happy. The dancing, singing and music. Reminded me of Mama Mia with one song after another, non-stop. It had a simple message, LOVE. Haters will hate, critics will criticize but no matter ""what others think"". I liked it.",The Prom
49,Nightmarelogic,Ryan Murphy at his most Ryan Murphy,7,13 December 2020,"If you know me you know I adore Ryan Murphy shows. All of them EXCEPT GLEE. I hated Glee. Something about the impossible sweet episode of the week everything works out eventually happy ever after just didn't appeal to me at the time. ""The Prom"" has that same feel but for whatever reason it works. Maybe because it is in a movie format or maybe because I also adore Meryl Streep and Nichole Kidman who play failed narcissistic Broadway actors who with a couple other also failed Broadway actors become convinced that all they need to revamp their own careers a cause. They pick a high school prom that was cancelled because a girl wanted to take her girlfriend and instead of not allowing her to go the school cancelled the prom all together.Anyone expecting a drama doesn't know Ryan Murphy. And I bring up Glee because like Glee this is also a peppy musical. A musical about doing the right thing and fighting the right battles. Where a bunch of Broadway fakes learn lessons on being their true selves by someone who refuses to be anything else.The movie isn't perfect but it is at least worth watching.",The Prom
50,snperera,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,8,12 December 2020,"THIS MOVIE IS SO AMAZING! IT IS SO CREATIVE, COLORFUL, UPLIFTING, AND POSITIVE!! I LOVE MUSICALS SO MUCH AND IT FILLED THE EMPTINESS IN MY SOUL SINCE BROADWAY IS CLOSED!!! IT HAS SUCH A GREAT MESSAGE AND IT IS SO HOPEFUL!",The Prom
51,Davalon-Davalon,Total fun,7,29 December 2020,"This was a fast, fun movie, filled with some really great laughs and some fun, upbeat songs. I didn't give it a 10 for a number of reasons, but mainly because it feels like an episode of GLEE in an alternate universe. Meaning: Ryan Murphy has a very specific agenda, which I completely understand as a gay man. But sometimes I think that agenda gets hammered home to the point where it stops being effective.Still, they took what was basically a very simple concept (a gay teen being denied the right to attend her high school prom with her girlfriend) and just exploded it and went to wild, crazy, supernova places. We watched it all in one sitting, which we usually don't, and for the most part, we really enjoyed it, especially the first half, where the jokes were stronger.As for James Corden: why are people hating on him? He's a marvelous singer, he can deliver a line well, he moves well on his feet, and he's not your typical leading man, but he can carry a film. Also, people have got to get past this insane philosophy where only ""gay"" people can play ""gay"" people in films. Why? It's called ""acting"" for a reason. I totally bought that James was a gay person. Why would I care if he was one in real life?Meryl Streep was fabulous as a narcissistic Broadway star. When she has her Evita-like moment, it was just brilliant and hysterically funny.The only real moment where I said, ""Oh, no, absolutely wrong"" was when Tracey Ullman pops up as James's mother. She looked like a cross between an old Cabbage Patch Kid and a Troll Doll, in a hideous wig. And in her ""big scene"" where she basically apologizes to James for not ""being there"" for him, and goes into this ghastly ""ugly cry,"" I just wanted to say, ""Cut! Cut! No, Tracey, no! Off with the wig, scrub the make-up, dump the Granny glasses, no ugly crying, NONE, rewrite the dialogue, and make this a REAL moment in this woman's life.""Yes, there were other off-kilter moments: Kerry Washington as the mother of a closeted lesbian teen doing a 360-degree turn around and being ""supportive"" of her teen lesbian daughter in the home stretch; and my (not) favorite: the insane over-the-top dance in the shopping mall, where Andrew Rannells turns into the Pied Paper of LGBTQ and leads his young Christian, homophobic charges in an escalator/fountain dance that has to be seen to be believed.On the plus side: Jo Ellen Pellman was absolutely wonderful and if Drew Barrymore ever needs someone to play her in her life story, Jo is your girl!The less you think during this movie, the more fun you'll have. And if you don't know who ""Tina Louise"" is, you will miss out on at least two huge jokes.",The Prom
52,thepriceofpayne,The Glitz and Glamour,7,14 December 2020,"""The Prom"" based on the 2018 stage musical of the same name, has always had a fight with itself for story, at its core telling something important and earnest but doing so in a way that's bright and flashy. If you go into it knowing this you'll have a fun time, but it's easy for that to be off putting to some unfamiliar with the original story. Ryan Murphy is both the best and worst choice to direct this, as his big style production aspects clearly shine through in all of his work, but his direction has never necessarily been subtle or deft, however this is some of his better work. Meryl Streep is phenomenal as always, her larger than life persona mixes well with the picture, and Jo Ellen Pellman and Arianna Debose are a huge highlight within the film, Pellman has a wide eyed innocence about her with a beautiful voice to back up her performance and her relationship with Debose is beautiful and quite realistic for this fantasy of a film, she isn't as shy or reserved as Kinnumen is in the original Broadway musical, but there's something about her that just makes you enjoy her any moment she's on screen, I hope to see more of her and Debose in the future. The rest of the characters and actors do their job well, Keegan Michael-Key, Andrew Rannells, and Nicole Kidman sell what they are given and make for entertaining people to watch. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the elephant in the room that is James Corden in the role of Barry. While I won't lie and say it would've been nice to see an actor apart of the LGBTQ+ community in that role. (Not that straight or gay actors can't play roles of a opposite orientation,though in this role it should have at least been a consideration) , I think Corden does adequately with what he's given, though at times he may come across as a caricature I don't think that's what he's doing. I think he's portraying a proud gay man, but he and much like the others he is cast aside (Streep, Rannells, and Kidman) are just as larger than life as the characters they play. This can at times make the satire of them feel very awkward because these actors are already famous in their own right. Altogether I believe ""The Prom"" is a modern day send up to musicals of the 1950's. Large ensemble cast, tons of bright colors, and lively set pieces, but this time with a story to tell for the modern era. If you're looking for a comedy that's much more nuanced and less showboaty detailing similar issues please watch ""Happiest Season"" on HULU. But if you're looking for an escape into glitz and glamour with some talented actors and stand out new comers leading the pack as well as an amazing soundtrack. I'd say Ryan Murphy's film is a fun watch, that may have you feeling quite warm inside by the end, pop it on and give it a watch.",The Prom
53,grahamvr,SPECTACULAR,10,13 December 2020,"What a wonderful movie from the team of Ryan Murphy. The all star cast delivers what can only be called great in terms of the characters they are playing. There have been so many bad reviews for James Corden yet his over the top, outrageous performance is wonderful.In my opinion the most stand out actor is Andrew Rannells who has finally been given a role which shows what great talent he has. His dance routine in the Shopping Mall is just spectacular. When he stood in the middle of the water fountain at the end of the dance I could see Esther Williams rising in the water. In Boys in the Band he gave an amazing performance with his real life partner, and now Ryan Murphy has given him an outstanding opportunity in continuing to build his career.So much of this film reminded me of the CinemaScope musicals of the 50s and 60s. I even expected to see a water ballet scene at one time but alas that did not happen.This movie is certainly what we need in this difficult time of Covid. Those who give it bad reviews should never have watched it in the first place without reading what it is about.CONGRATULATIONS TO A WONDERFUL CAST AND CREW",The Prom

Merly Streep is a fantastic actress as well as Nicole Kidman James cordon is a good actor this is got to be the worse film there have done.

I love how Streep makes fun of herself and was not sure Kidman was Kidman until the credits ran since she doesn't look like her that much anymore. Has she had a lot of work done, anyway she was wearing way too much eye shadow/liner. I liked the songs but the dance numbers were too cut and jummpy. They should have had the camera still on them dancing and not have the camera jumping around. The film was fun, a bit long but I did enjoy it mostly because of Streep.",The Prom
56,mbhgkmsgg,The Prom,5,12 December 2020,"The Prom is the movie adaptation of a Broadway show bearing the same name. It has an important message, and for the most part, is entertaining. And while most of the music is good, the way it translates to the silver screen is, unfortunately, quite hit or miss.Since music is what makes or breaks a musical, let's start with that. Most songs were catchy and fun, and the ones that were meant to be more emotional worked fairly well. Had that not been that case, The Prom would've been an absolute disaster. While some musicals may save the singing for the most important story points, this one used them for everything. It's song after song, and the breaks in between tend to be quite short. Some, I'm sure, will be opposed to that as is, but I didn't mind it too much. However, when the entire narrative is told through song, they need to be good. And most of them certainly are. In fact, I don't think that there was anything wrong with the songs themselves, unfortunately though, some of the performances worked well in a movie form, while others didn't.
What makes musicals on a live stage good is the sense of wonder and admiration. It's always more impressive to watch someone sing and act and dance live on stage, rather than in a movie. And on stage, even if the song itself isn't the most memorable one, the props and grandeur of the whole performance make it come to life, literally. So when you take music and performances designed for a stage and put them into a movie, they are already at a disadvantage. And while watching The Prom, it's easy to see that. However, movies do also bring their own possibilities. And it was those songs and performances, that used and benefitted from the movie format, that worked the best. While others, unfortunately, felt like cheap and lifeless copies of what they could've been on stage.The story, which introduces us to a group of dishevelled broadway actors who have lost their charm, is quite good. While the group of four actors are the main focus of the story, we also follow the life of Emma, a 17-year old girl who is trying to fight for a prom that welcomes everyone, no matter who they love. The group of actors help Emma on her journey, while learning a lot about themselves, as well. Although the story didn't offer anything new or groundbreaking, it does come with a crucially important message. The message that we should all be proud of who we are, and we should all be free to love whoever we want to. And it's that message that really carries this film.However, while the story and the musical performances were great, the movie as a whole wasn't. What baffles me the most, is how slow The Prom felt. You'd think that a movie that is basically one colourful and striking performance after another would go by in a whim. But, this one did the opposite. I checked how much there was left at least three times, and every time I was amazed by how much there was. The only reason I can come up with for its sluggish feel is an overuse of music. Since the story is quite a simple one, it could've been told much quicker in a non-musical format. While the songs and performances are fun, they also make the narrative take a lot longer. And although I did enjoy most of the songs, I guess they just lacked the effect that they would've had on stage.It's quite unfortunate that The Prom felt like it was twice as long as it actually was. Had that not been the case, I think I would've enjoyed it quite a bit more. It has a good message, as well as a good heart, and what it lacks in originality, it tries to make up for with entertaining musical numbers, and for the most part, it succeeds. While it does a lot of things right, the end product just felt underwhelming and lacked the charisma and wow factor that it would have had on a stage.",The Prom

Always too busy trying to be appreciable, recognized, praised for his commitment to the good cause, trying to appear good, innocent and honest (and to include as many product placement as possible) that it neglects everything else with extreme superficiality: from the two-dimensional and stereotypical characters and the mediocre choreographie to the repetitive, forgettable and corny songs.

58,madanmarwah,A fascinating musical entertainer,7,28 March 2021,"This film will be loved by all those who like full fledged musicals. Some time back we had La La Land which mesmerized us. This film is similar.In this film Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman play the main roles with great style and chutzpah. We still remember them from Mama Mia and Chicago which are still fresh in our minds. This film has first rate acting, music, lyrics, choreography and cinematography which give it class and the songs/ dances are a treat to watch. Such films are not meant for all types of audiences and they have their own fans who will be thrilled.The plot is fairly simple. After a failed show in Broadway, down and out Broadway stars Meryl and Nicole with team are desperate for a come back. They hit upon a plan to gain some publicity by supporting gay girl student in Indiana, USA who wants to take her girlfriend to the prom but is being refused by the orthodox minded authorities. After the usual roadblocks, heartbreaks , and misunderstandings things get sorted out .The film is interspersed throughout with some lovely songs and dances.

The Prom brings this all together.
I guess you could call this a 'realistic' fantasy !! See it again and again.
Reminds me of a combination of Bye Bye Birdie and Glee. Like Glee the editing of the dances is not right. Too much editing ruins the dance numbers. Why not just focus a while on the whole number and not jerk it around. Same thing that ruined Glee. Do like Fred Astaire insisted upon. Keep the numbers intact and keep the editing at a stand still and let the performers PERFORM. It's really cheating the great choreography. Other than that this is a must see!!",The Prom

If he's in it, it's bad.This is a musical with an emphasis on music-too much of it and none of it memorable. The story is an old one, from some event that I occurred decades ago. Predictable, thus boring and uninformative.Tracy Ullman has one or two scenes and through her appearance, delivers 90% of the acting quality that resides in this film.Oh, and I forgot...

It certainly is one of this year's more positive films, and please will everyone stop knocking James Corden. I thought he looked and sounded like Russell Grant, and everyone likes him. And of course Meryl Streep had lots of fun with her diva character, so similar to Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada'. It's a fun evening's entertainment to enjoy over Christmas.",The Prom

70,avenuesf,Nothing special here,3,12 December 2020,"First of all, I have to say I've never been impressed with James Corden's acting abilities, but there was absolutely NOTHING whatsoever I could find in his performance here that was ""stereotypically gay."" It's more than obvious reading these reviews that we have a group of people here who have pulled themselves together to use ""The Prom"" as the sacrificial lamb to protest that they don't want straight people playing gay roles. The sad thing is that they've chosen a production by Ryan Murphy, of all people, to rally against. Murphy has done more for us in the the gay community for the last ten years than any producer has before. It's also interesting to note that Andrew Rannels is playing a straight man in this film but none of these reviewers have commented on that.The plot of ""The Prom"" revolves around a lesbian high school girl in Indiana who is being denied entrance to her school prom due to discrimination; as a result, the school P.T.A. shuts the prom down completely. A group of has-been Broadway stars go to Indiana to support her (""We're liberals from New York,"" a particularly embarrassing line) in the hopes of changing conventional ideas.Let's face it: ""The Prom"" isn't a very good film. It's mostly predictable, the plot just isn't that interesting, and it doesn't have one cast member that's ever been known for being musically inclined (in a couple of numbers the performers actually sound dubbed). It's also overlong by about half an hour. Like most musicals, the narrative basically revolves around one song after another, but the problem here is there isn't one number that's particularly memorable.Still, with all the television Ryan Murphy has produced, he's entitled to a miss now and then. What is is notable about ""The Prom"" is that despite its clumsiness, it still manages to make an important message about tolerance and being different. It won't hurt you to watch it, but there's definitely nothing remarkable here.",The Prom

I loved the star studded lineup of actors with Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and James Corden. I wasn't as familiar with Andrew Rannells, but he performed my favorite number ""Love Thy Neighbor."" In a scene reminiscent of a flash mob, he performed ""Love They Neighbor"" in a mall with the cast of Godspell as his chorus. This song was at the heart of ""The Prom"". I could identify with the lyrics with how people often pick and choose which rules they follow from the scriptures. For example, it's no longer acceptable to stone a child for disobeying his parents. ""If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his bloodguiltiness is upon him."" It's not acceptable to follow that Bible rule anymore thankfully or we wouldn't have many children left. The point of the song was that loving your neighbor as yourself trumps all other rules. The point was well taken, and the musical number was fantastic as a bonus!!The Prom delivered an important serious message, while offering great humor and fun musical numbers. That's a tough task. James Corden and Nicole Kidman both were fantastic when they had one-on-one scenes with the teenage Emma.The ending wrapped up too nicely and neatly for me or I may have given an extra star.",The Prom

The good in this movie most of the cast honestly fit really well in there roles but the cast in general even though most of them don't fit are really good in this movie especially Jo Ellen Pellman who just nails her roll as the main character Emma. The characters for the most part are likable and you really feel for most of them. The music because this is an adaptation of the hit musical for the most part is good there is some really good songs in this movie like just breathe, dance with you, you happened, tonight belongs to you and the reprise version, Alyssa Greene, unruly heart, and it's time to dance are all great songs in this movie. The 3rd act had me smiling and at times on the verge of tears because of how sweet it is. The movie is also very pretty to look at. The message of self love is a message I can get behind. But there is a lot of problems with this movie to. Some members of the cast just don't fit in there characters meryl Streep and James cordon are both really good in the movie but it's really difficult seeing them playing there characters because they are just so miscasted. The 1st and 2nd acts even though there is moments that are good are just so slow in pacing and at times are just really boring. The rest of the songs that I didn't notice are just bland and unoriginal. The run time just feels to long. The story even though it is an interesting story is just at times poorly executed. Overall, I think this movie does have talent and at times there is a lot of fun to be had in this movie BUT the movie just doesn't work at times and there's a lot weighing it down from being honestly a really really great movie because currently it's just okay and enjoyable. This movie well for sure be loved by people and maybe it's aimed for a certain audience but in the end I think you should give the prom a chance and maybe someday in the future I'll give it another shot and if my thoughts change I'll re review it.",The Prom

Many critics have said it is corny but musicals are supposed to be whimsical and entertaining. The story is one that was well delivered in a most pleasing way. The message of accepting people as they are could not have been presented in a more awesome format. Cudos to the director and writer of this film. It should get a warm and well deserved award. 👍🏻,The Prom
80,BirdzOfParadise,I love musicals but...,5,4 January 2021,...they really overdid it with the musical numbers in this one. For a good part of the movie every 5 min there was a different song. And they weren't that good. I give it a 5 simply for the cast and theme.,The Prom

82,janeannafoote,Excellent Feel Good Musical,9,12 December 2020,"In spite of some pacing issues during the 2nd half of the movie, The Prom is a great time and one of the better movie musicals of the past 20 years. The cast is great and Meryl Streep hasn't been this funny in ages. I was also surprised by how much her singing voice has developed. Maybe these songs are just more in her range, but she's never sounded better. I laughed, I cried, I smiled from joy - it gave me everything a movie musical is supposed to and I can't understand where any hate is coming from.",The Prom

It did not work!The cast consisting of well-known faces and big names cannot make up for the poor script and the mediocre film altogether.The music is very disappointing to me. Nothing really very melodical or even sing/hum-along and not like the music in older days composed for musicals/music films. The titles are very middle-of-the-road-soon-to-be-forgotten-again stuff.Based on my disappointment, four stars is my absolute max. What a waste of time and money and big names.

85,MacArthur_Parker,A treat for musical lovers everywhere,10,6 December 2020,"By no means is The Prom an Oscar contender but despite its obvious flaws, it is a great time for all involved and anyone into musicals. If you're into Glee and High School Musical, you're the demographic for The Prom.A quartet of self-absorbed Broadway actors - Patti LuPone-esque Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep), openly gay Barry Glickman (James Corden), former sitcom star Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells) and eternal chorus girl Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman) - seek a publicity revival in a Conservative Indiana town, where high school senior Emma Nolan (newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman) has been barred from the prom for wanting to bring her girlfriend.Pellman is a powerhouse in her first role, her performance so real and so relatable to anyone who's ever been cast out. The ever-talented Ariana DeBose is Emma's closeted girlfriend Alyssa, whose mother (Kerry Washington) is the ultimate Karen. The top billed stars are scene-scarfing narcissists but they each have their true colors shining through. Even Corden, who has been blasted for being a straight actor in a gay role, has stepped up from his previous movie musical spot (last year's critically lambasted Cats).In supporting roles are Keegan-Michael Key as the high school principal (I've never heard him sing before this and he is an absolute delight), and Nico Greetham, Nathaniel J. Potvin, Logan Riley Hassel and Sofia Dieler as a group of Emma and Alyssa's classmates who receive perhaps the most character development.The music and choreography are the film's highest point. It's a Ryan Murphy project, so those are bound to be of high quality, and the outrageously campy Prom is another notch in my guilty pleasure musical repertoire.",The Prom
86,pebsdad,"Corny, Dated, and a Total Joy!",9,13 December 2020,"I was concerned when I saw the low ratings and averages but this is everything a musical theater fan can love. The storyline seems a bit dated for a musical written just a few years ago but it is the set up needed for stitching together all the musical tropes to create a wonderful new musical. Corden and Streep chew bits of the scenery every chance they get and it is over the top corny, much like Hairspray was. They are great together, dropping great little asides that you sometimes have to pay attention to get. The songs were great and the dancing, although nothing new and kinda cliche, is a lot of fun. I will be watching this again soon because it was 2 hours of complete entertainment.",The Prom
87,berndgeiling,Love thy neighbor!,6,23 December 2020,"A touching message, an engaged ensemble, but mediocre music, which doesn't leave a lasting impression and a kind of plastic atmosphere all around.
I am not sure if form and content made a convincing match here. But I enjoyed the actors, led by the great Meryl Streep, good moments brought in by Jo Ellen Pellman and Keegan-Michael Key.
Nicole Kidman performs a charming number, reminiscing the good old ( and way better Musical times ) of Bob Fosse, for me the only number with some individual personal character. The rest sounds and sings more or less the same quite stereotypical way with choreographies executed in a very athletic, almost robot-like perfection, not adding much to lacking charisma, inspite of the fact that the movie's message is worth to be heard and understood.",The Prom

I loved the cast especially the girl who played Emma.. she has a great singing voice. I am not a fan of Nicole Kidman ( probably a sin given I am Australian..ha ha) but even liked her in it. Just watch it , enjoy it and if you are homophobic then shame on you .. we are all equal.",The Prom
89,firti,I really tried to like it,5,14 December 2020,That is another disappointment for me what a year! Such a big production looks like lots of money spent. First of all singing does not sound real as top 4 they should be famous singers if they could sing that well. Film full of cliches you can easily guess what will happen next and songs are very basic they all sound like a high school musical. It could be an amazing film but sadly it didnt happen.,The Prom
90,Lockout_Salties,"Not good, not bad, just average",5,13 December 2020,"My feeling towards this movie are quite mixed. It doesn't suffer from the same problems many other movie musicals face (overly long, really boring, etc.), but it still has problems.Firstly, I'll start with the things I liked. Most of the performances were very good. The lesbian lead was especially well-acted, especially because this is the actress's first movie. Her emotions felt genuine, and she was always able to evoke a lot of sympathy from me. I also really liked Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman. Both had some funny lines and a few good songs. Additionally, the initial premise of the movie is quite clever and topical. Mainstream LGBT+ films are always welcome, and especially one that deals with performative activism and homophobia. I wish the film had explored its theme of homophobia more (such as seeing how it effects the main character's day-to-day life), but it's still a good starting place.Now let's get into the bad stuff. To start with, next to Corden, Streep, and Kidman, there's a fourth character in the movie who doesn't undergo any transformation as a character. I get that he was supposed to change the town instead of changing himself, but that doesn't excuse him being a two-dimensional character. Another thing: Nicole Kidman is very under-utilized. She has no arc as a character, and only has a handful of lines. Considering that she's my favourite of the four main characters, this was really disappointing, especially considering that her number is one of the best in the film. Speaking of the songs, most of them don't feel memorable or distinct whatsoever. The only two exceptions to this are the catchy gospel number ""Love thy neighbor"" that's also a a good critique of certain Christians' hypocrisy, and the aforementioned Kidman number ""Give it some Zazz,"" which is a nice reference to the song numbers of Bob Fosse. But other than them, most of the songs sound weirdly similar, as if they're all part of one, ginormous song. Even the obligatory song that's only added to be eligible for an Oscar nomination leaves no impact at all.Now, let's get to the problem that everyone's been talking about: James Corden's performance. I'll say that it isn't the worst gay man performance I've seen (Betty's ridiculously stereotypical friend on Riverdale still takes the cake), but it's still pretty appalling. When your only gay man is saying lines like ""I'm as gay as a bucket of wigs,"" you should completely rewrite him. Corden's subplot where he comes to terms with his past doesn't work, because his character is so cliche I can't empathize with him at all. It never feels like I'm watching a gay man reckon with his troubled past, it feels like I'm watching James Corden perform every harmful stereotype in the book. When films like A Chorus Line and My Own Private Idaho (both 25+ years old) have more realistic gay men than you, then there's a very big problem.What's especially baffling is that there's a very simple fix to the problems with the film's leads: why not just have Love thy Neighbor guy be gay and undergo the transformations that happen to Corden's character? That way, Kidman can take Corden's place as the lesbian lead's friend and have her arc be about being appreciated by someone. Traces of this are present in the film: there's a scene where Kidman and the teen are talking and it's explained that they're friends. Kidman even expresses how happy she is that someone is noticing her, as normally seems just thought of as a chorus girl. So have her help the teenage girl with getting ready for the prom and encouraging her instead of James Corden, and use that extra screen time to expand on her issues with being ignored. As for how the solution would work for Corden and Love thy Neighbor guy, it hits two birds with one stone. It gives Love thy Neighbor guy a character arc (accepting his past), and it gets rid of Corden's offensive caraciture of a gay man. The movie would be vastly improved if they implemented this change, and my rating would go up at least a number.Overall, The Prom is an average movie. The acting was mostly good, and the story was relevant, but the songs are mediocre and there were many missed opportunities and two too many underdeveloped characters, made worse because they're ostensibly the protagonists. Additionally, Corden's performance was ridiculous in its offensiveness. Whilst The Prom may make for a fun evening for some, I think it should've just stayed on the stage.Final Score: 48/100.",The Prom

As such, not great but sure good enough.The songs are far catchier and flow more naturally into the scenes than other musicals of this genre. Everyone sang better than expected - Meryl Streep's assured singing exceeds her shaky performance in Mamma Mia.I don't particularly like James Corden either (but certainly not to the extent of his compatriot Piers Morgan whom I find a total yuckky loud ego fake), but to be fair I can't fault his good-enough performance here as with every cast member. Also, everyone else (except for Keegan-Michael Key who played it pleasantly 'normal', surprisingly) was camping it up so why shouldn't Corden? And his level of campiness suits the character and is by no means overdone. I don't know why so many people have an issue with him, when nobody seemed to bat an eyelid when Eric Stonestreet (who is totally straight also) camped it truly all the way up in Modern Family - why the double standard? Gays play straights, straights play gays - who cares as long as the performance suits the characters.I recommend this good-enough brainless musical. Enjoy! 😊",The Prom

101,pearlinasilverbasin,Barely passable,4,17 January 2021,"This movie with its brightly hued technicolor aesthetic and plethora of musical tropes and sometimes slightly offensive gay stereotypes has clearly drawn inspiration from a handful of other classics, such as Funny Face and Singin' In The Rain and the lgbt+ classics Victor, Victoria (1982) and Priscilla Queen of the Desert and most obviously Love Simon (2018). However despite all of this inspiration the movie has almost no redemptive qualities of its own.The plot is meandering, boring and wire-thin. Except for J. E. Pellman's performance as Emma all of the characters are flat and annoying and have about the depth of a Disney Channel movie.The visuals are seemingly intentionally campy, but instead of this producing a pleasing easy-going atmosphere it just looks screechingly bad on purpose.

Streep's musical numbers are sometimes better than in the praised Mamma Mia, but probably best in her over the top caricature of a Celebrity.

108,molemandavid,Jazzy Musical,8,12 December 2020,"Movie musicals are normally a mixed bag.

The Prom embraces the format completely with some mixed, but mostly positive results.After their latest show bombs, two self-obsessed Broadway actors recruit two of their out of work friends to get some much needed positive press by crashing into a small town to teach the yokels a thing or two about tolerance after a lesbian high schooler isn't allowed to take her girlfriend to prom.It could be said that The Prom is a little over directed. Some musical numbers work wonderfully and others seem to be edited to have a cut every 5 seconds to either keep the audience awake or distract from some less than stellar footwork from the Hollywood actors coming into the musical world. These choices can be distracting, but everyone involved in so joyful and game to entertain that it becomes a slight weakness rather than a huge drawback.Armed with a wonderful cast, director Ryan Murphy pulls every laugh and tear he can from the material even if certain moments can get a little too sweet and sugary for its own good.

114,joshtill-98100,The Prom: A Bowlful of Glitter With A Whole Lot Of Heart,9,14 December 2020,"The Prom (2020) was one of my most anticipated films of 2020. As an avid broadway fan, I had heard of the smash hit musical of the same name, and listened to the soundtrack a few times. While it has never been my go-to, it always creeps up and never seems to fail at turning my frown into a smile. Just before its closure in 2019, Ryan Murphy announced that he was so moved by the project that he wanted to share it with the rest of the world, by making it a movie. I have always admired Ryan Murphys work (Glee, Hollywood, etc) so I was excited and scared to see what he would do, as this was very heavy source material.The Prom tells the story of Emma Nolan (Jo Ellen Pellman), a lesbian high school student who just wants to take her closeted girlfriend Alyssa (Ariana Debose) to her senior prom. Sorely based on homophobia, the PTA of the school, led by Alyssa's mother (Kerry Washington) decides to cancel the event entirely. This catches the attention of four failing broadway stars, Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep), Barry Glickman (James Corden), Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman), and Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannels). Together, the four come up with the massive plan to help the girl in order gain some positive publicity, after a review called them ""narcissists"". As time progresses, the four retreat from their shallow thought processes and truly open up their hearts to Emma and Principal Tom Hawkins (Keegan-Michael Key) and help her find courage to speak up for herself.The scripture is beautiful, it truly makes you feel for each and every character that you cross and teaches the valuable lessons of acceptance and empathy. Meryl Streep as Dee Dee Allen is utter perfection, she makes the role truly fun and unique, a kind of acting that we rarely get to see from her. Her vocals are great in her songs, but her performance in ""It's Not About Me"" is amazing and truly breathtaking. James Corden was also great in his role as Barry, and while his accent could use some work, his overall emotional vulnerability and dedication to the role really shows. His song ""Barry Is Going To Prom"" is really inspiring, and while maybe not sung the best, the performance really sells it.Andrew Rannels' Trent Oliver is nothing short of hilarious, and while we are all sad that ""The Acceptance Song"" got shortened, he gets a big show stopping number with ""Love Thy Neighbour"", which is one of the best parts of the entire film. Nicole Kidman, while perfect in the role, really lacked in screen time. Her solo song ""Zazz"" if fun while it lasts, but is completely forgettable amongst the other songs. Keegan-Michael Key really surprised us with his singing and acting abilities in this film, same with Kerry Washington. Ariana Debose is stunning and a beautiful singer and actress. Her song ""Alyssa Greene"" is truly heartbreaking and really makes you feel for the character. Jo Ellen Pellman's Emma is a perfect representation of that character and both of her songs, ""Just Breathe"" and ""Unruly Heart"" are amazing and true tearjerkers.Now, with all this good, there is a little bit of downfall. First off, the synching the actors lips to the prerecorded songs was noticeable in some songs and it took away from the spectacle. Second, the major cutting of two songs, ""The Acceptance Song"" and ""You Happened"" was noticeable and really made me mad. Lastly, the glitz and glamour of colour in each song was kind of distracting and made it feel very overdone.Overall, The Prom is a great watch for friends and family alike. Everyone can relate to these characters and their stories. The world can learn from this movie how to be more empathetic and not live in a world based on fear. Overall, The Prom (2020) gets a 9/10.",The Prom

123,BoomerFan,I Expected More Polish,7,13 December 2020,"With an A-List cast based on a hit Broadway musical, you'd expect The Prom to be hitting every production high note. But something about it felt compromised and rushed, as if there wasn't quite the time and budget to do it right.For one thing, it was choppy; scenes were obviously cut out, probably to hit the two hour run-time. I would love to see the deleted scenes reel. For example, we're suddenly in a scene with Emma's grandmother with no set-up or explanation. You can figure it out, but something's missing. Similarly, the climactic resolution between Kerry Washington's character and her daughter needed something more than just being suddenly dropped in there.While the setting was bland, small-town Indiana, the scenes in the high school and mall looked like someone said, go out and find us a place we can shoot, cheap. Nothing special. On the other hand, the early number on the street outside Broadway theaters was brilliant.As you would expect, the acting was first rate. Streep is Streep - she can do anything. Kidman made the most of a smaller part. The young performers, especially Jo Ellen Pellman's Emma, are excellent. My only minor quibble was that I couldn't get used to Corden's (excellent) American accent, but he played the character perfectly.Don't get me wrong. It's still entertaining and well worth seeing. It just feels like it could have been so much more. The Prom reached for Great, but didn't quite make it.",The Prom

The Prom, while making fun of everyone and everything in an edgy fashion, in the end has just a disarming message for everyone: let Emma go to the prom; straight or gay does not matter!The writing is sharp and funny. The songs are catchy. The actors are delightful. Murphy's movie version knows to capture and deliver the big and small moments. While ""Glee"" lost it's soul, becoming a direct-to-iTunes music video commercial, The Prom makes you feel warm and fuzzy.It captures the best of the old Hollywood musicals, or the Stephen Sondheim kind, while being modern and can melt hearts of everybody ... if people will allow it to.",The Prom

Both of them are decent singers and it's nice to see them get this opportunity to strut their stuff.The bad part- the anti bigotry plot drowns in overkill as insult after insult is directed at the flyover - country hicks who want to keep two high school lesbians from having a prom. The message is a good one but this movie beats it to death and demonstrates yet again why people from a place like Indiana could vote for Trump.The film, directed by the creator of the TV series Glee, follows the same path of almost non stop energy and music and bright colors and movement.

The plot is very weak at points. For example: somewhere in the beginning Nicole Kidman's character walked in, and at the end I still had no idea what she was doing in this movieHalf way through the mean, conservative teenagers are suddenly converted into supporting LGBTQ-activists in three minutes because of Andrew Rannell's character singing a musical number about idiosyncracies in the Christian faith. I mean, really? It wasn't even that great a song.Even though there are some touching, emotional moments, there are also moments that feel like an explosion of sugar that will give you a toothache for days on endPro's:

And Andrew Rannell since Girls.I love musicals and Broadway and this was right up my alley. I will say I get where people who aren't into Broadway shows will think there was too much music, I even thought that for a split second when James and Andrew were off the screen for a bit, but then Andrew came back with Love Thy Neighbor and I was back in.The main girl, for being a newbie, was good, but almost too smiley.

But in this case it impacts a girl who wants to take her girlfriend to the Prom. Following a failed Broadway Musical enter James Corden and Meryl Streep, accompanied by Nicole Kidman and Andrew Rannells, to save the day (for publicity) for the girl played by Jo Ellen Pellman. Kerry Washington, head of the PTA and influential to the townspeople have denied not only the girl from going to the Prom but has eliminated the Prom entirely. While Streep and Corden are both excellent and Kidman had her moments Pellman steals the movie with both her presence and her singing. Ariana DeBose, Pellman's girlfriend, demonstrates her acting and singing capabilities in her first film role. There are a couple of memorable tunes but this movie won't challenge the Rodgers and Hammerstein successes.

Please don't pass on this because the messaging and songs are wonderful but also don't be surprised if you find yourself fast forwarding a bit to get through some of the music.

139,megomike,"Uninspired Music, But Warm as an After School Special",7,4 February 2021,"While Meryl, James, and Kerry do their best to serve the message, it is pretty clear that they are being themselves in roles simply designed to move conversations forward, and that's okay. Nicole Kidman comes closest to giving a performance out of the zone, but even then the script limited her. Still, the message they share is beautiful, with a lot of understanding towards those that fear or do not understand gay love, and that is the true strength of this movie. It has the theatrical chops of an old 80's Afterschool Special, but the warmth and understanding of one as well. It is a love letter to LGTBQ children in the midst of doubt, confusion, shame or fear, that they are truly loved, and are worthy of that love. I give The Prom 3.5/5 stars and recommend it for anyone with an open mind needing reminders of how we are meant to judge others different than we are, and even more for anyone discovering emotions that fall outside their family norms, experiencing that judgement.

When I heard Keegan-Michael Key had a new movie coming out and it was called The Prom, I quit listening because I think he is that great and I knew I was going to watch it right away. I was surprised it is a musical, but it was a delightful surprise. I was only surprised because, as I said, I quit listening.All the musical numbers are quite good, some are really excellent! I thought everyone, and there are sooo many important names in The Prom, was wonderful. The amazing Meryl Streep is here and so so good. To think how good she is in so many different characters is unfathomable. I loved Andrew Rannells in The New Normal and it was so wonderful to see him here. He brings something special to everything I have seen him in. I have never paid attention to James Corden before, but he was really great. He was funny and selfish but also selfless and poignant. I don't see how you could watch the movie and think that he was not wonderful. Nicole Kidman was great as the most thoughtful one-on-one of the Broadway bunch. She is so beautiful it is hard to wrap your head around it. That's not important to the movie, but it is unmistakable. Kerry Washington was so convincing as narrow minded and defensive. Django Unchained convinced me that she is the most beautiful woman in the world, and this one had me seeing her as one of the most controlling mothers in the world. It is the role of actors to see the character and not the actor walking around. They were more than wonderful.The movie made me think about whether narcissism rooted in abandonment and self survival is less or more deeply entrenched than narcissism rooted in pure conceit and entitlement.This movie made me very happy even if I also sobbed like a baby more than once. If you do not know what it feels like to be an outsider no matter what the reason, I cannot image what kind of life you have had. The reason here is played out over and over all over this country and many others. To have the story told with a peaceful resolution is not simpleminded, it is modeling.

The whole movie was the basic musical, the actors were decent and the music was not so exciting, but it fit well in the movie.

However, the second thing which I noticed, and unfortunately struggled to un-notice, was James Corden's fake American accent. It actually took me two separate attempts to finish the film because it distracted so much from his actual acting performance (which really wasn't bad) and it made me quite uncomfortable. Also, do we really need another straight white guy playing a gay character? Not really.As for the story, it was a bit slow at times with a lot of dull dialogue and not very memorable songs (apart from ""Love Thy Neighbour"", which I would highly recommend listening to for an accurate and hilarious middle finger up to Christian homophobia). I think the premise of the film was very original; I did very much enjoy the sarcastic take on the performative activism of celebrities which we often see. The Prom set my expectations high with its fabulous cast and the promise of being a feel-good musical centred around LGBTQ+ rights, however for me it fell short by having only one memorable song, unremarkable characters and a forgettable plot.

But if you like these things or are open to learning about them and have ever been to a Broadway show it somehow captures some of that magic. During a time when theater's return is looking iffy at best for another year, I'll take it. They all look like they were having the time of their lives making it and that joy is infectious.

James corden isn't actually to bad I mean he does play the role of Barry glickman really well.
Then you have andrew rennells who plays trent Oliver, he's rendition of ""love thy neighbour"" is really well done.The reason I say rendition is because for some of you, who might not know this film the prom, is based on the Broadway show the prom.

Music really does heal the soul plus the story was one that very applicable to today's youth and I feel will give those struggling with their voice and fear to step up and not feel alone.

Thank the heavens for Meryl and Nicole being greats who do manage to do such in their scenes but Andrew never even gets a chance to participate much at all because he's basically the gay foil for James's mess of an acting job.",The Prom

With this being a musical of course i have to comment on the songs, and GOD they do have some killer bops in it! and really packed with great choreography and sets too!It might be too cheesy for me but somehow it feels like a guilty pleasure. The acting was okay, the problem lies in some plot points that are resolved too quickly. It kinda bugs me, but it could also be because in the movie format they have to cut some stuff or something (i haven't seen the original musical sooo i can't say much about it.

If you are expecting something extremely original and fun throughout, it might not be for you. It's basically about a gay teenager, who wants to join prom, but there are people against this decision. The only thing that bothered me slightly was how stiff Nicole Kidman was due to this role being the wrong decision for her. Maybe it was intentional but it was hard to watch the ""zazz"" scene.

179,clara-76859,Worst musical ever,3,23 April 2021,"This film was bad for so many reasons. I just watched it because I normally love musicals and the actors are great, but I was very disappointed.The first reason it was bad, is the plot. It was so normal and unoriginal. I had the feeling that nothing happened and that I've just been staring at an empty screen for two hours and ten minutes (not so) straight. The story had a bad structure and everything went so fast and easily. Those celebrities randomly decide to help a random girl they don't know? That part wasn't profound enough. It felt like the writers put no time in finding a reason for them to help her. I also don't like how easily the homophobic people accepted it, as if that's realistic. And in the end they're just forgiven after how horribly they treated Emma? There's a happy ending and there's a too happy ending, this is the second one. That was basically the whole plot. And also, who the hell makes such a big deal out of a prom?Another reason no one should watch this, is the horrible music. One of the most important things about a musical is the music, so they should've put more time into it. It was boring and unmemorable.I know these are good actors, but this wasn't the best I've seen of them. That's probably just because the script is so stupid, so I don't even blame the actors.That was about it, just one more thing: never, ever watch this!",The Prom

Who actually thinks James Corden can act? Please someone give the LBGTQ community a musical they can actually take pride in. Pure tripe. Does Meryl Streep need money this bad?,The Prom
182,lulu_aka_pinky,A walking cliché,3,18 December 2020,"The movie really lacks depth and emotions.
Meryl Streep is absolutely great and gorgeous as usual but James Corden, as much as I love him, honestly, but his acting in this is God awful! Absolutely terrible! Nicole Kidman is really trying and for the most pulls through.
The songs are also a musical cliché.... Exactly what you'd expect from an amateur musical- I am shocked that with this level of A list actors that the songs weren't better. I can't even remember a single one...
And the character Emma lacks depth too. She's always smiling even though her world is crushing down and when she cries, it looks so shallow with your typical facing the camera, back turned to whoever is with her, and pretty crying. Absolutely unbelievable! (The girl can sing though) It's like they want her to constantly be this happy go lucky person but it's just not realistic for a teenager to be that way when facing a crisis!
I was pleasantly surprised by Michael Keegan's musical debut though. I love that he was in this movie. Thank God for him and Meryl Streep. But seriously don't watch it. It's horrible.",The Prom
183,orjis,Joyful and hits the mark,8,13 December 2020,"Don't listen to the haters of James Corden. They are just being very audible here. He is actually good in this and has several scenes in which he shows real depth as an actor. Is he overpaying the gayness? Yes and no.. As a Gay man I know several of this ""type"" and I can be it myself, the drama-Gay, it's real. But in his real scenes he is heartbreaking. Part from this, So refreshing to see something uplifting and positive with good music and actors. The pairing of the cast is brilliantand Jo Ellen does a great job of portraying a slightly naive high schooler with big ideas. Love the scenes with James and Meryl, and pairing Meryl with Micheal-keegan was brilliant.
Music can sometimes be a bit predictable but there are several great numbers despite of that. Nicole finally does a sympathetic role again and is a bit downplayed.. Thought it would be bigger but never mind, love her.
Best laugh--Meryl going for the fight
Best tears- James heartbreaking moments with Meryl and later Tracey Ullman

184,blaneyontheboogie,Could've been fabulous,5,11 December 2020,James Corden ruins everything. His performance in this is no exception... but this one is also offensive. I'm sure Ryan Murphy has full rolodex of talented gay men who could've made this movie a 10 star effort with its sweet message and catchy songs... as soon as Hollywood stop casting Corden the better musical movies can be.,The Prom
185,jbt_281181,Ode to the pretentious:,10,12 December 2020,"Somewhere along the way, the patronizing general American audience dusted off a fedora they found in the back of their closet. They plopped it on their heads and they became eye-rolling, over analytical movie critics. Keyboard warriors. Telephone tough guys. Unfortunately, your venomous egos have found your way to this movie.Ironically, you've attacked the agenda of the material. Granted, I will give you ""Love Thy Neighbor."" Aside from the impressive dance number, it was underwhelming. But you stand alone everywhere else. I don't believe the agenda of the actors was self-motivated. I believe James Corden has left us with his BEST work- gay men play straight men all the time. It is NOT offensive for a straight man to play gay- it is not over the top either. It is ornamental but I know plenty of PEOPLE who are. Nicole Kidman: nailed. it. Meryl Streep: typical. Typically wonderful. Keenan: a breath of fresh air. There wasn't a stale performance. I absolutely adored this film. In a year when cinema needed heart, we got it with The Prom.",The Prom
186,copperrd,A Flashy Feel-Good,8,12 December 2020,"I think with any musical movie adaptation, it is safe to count on losing some of the authenticity of the voices. With that being said, yes, some of the songs sounded off or overly autotuned, but they still had their effect in the end. If you're an automatic anti-James Corden fan, then this is not the movie for you. If you have an open mind though, I did not find his performance horrible in the least bit. Can he be over dramatic in all the wrong ways, yes. For this role though, I think it fit better than I expected and I appreciated what he did with the character. The others in the Broadway cast aways group were also fun and at times lovable characters as well. One common thing I saw in the reviews was that you could atleast relate to one of the characters throughout the movie. With the different array of personalities, acting methods, and voices, I would strongly agree to that. I think Emma's character got lost in certain sections and the storyline got carried away, but in the end, the story found it's way back.",The Prom

It's the correct amount of over the top.I feel like some people don't understand that it's wildly satirical. And that satire isn't reserved for one specific group. If you think it's PC political propaganda, you're just wrong. It's a movie about love. It's also about how hard it can be when people don't accept you for who you are. Last time I checked, that's not a political statement. One might even say the lesson is ""love thy neighbor"".

This was a best-in-class version of what Ryan Murphy can do with a big budget, great actors to work with, and strong source material. It was joyful, touching, campy, and funny. It's skewered self-important Broadway types while poignantly letting us empathize with the marginalized main character. I didn't notice any auto-tuning, however the singing was pitch perfect so that might explain it. As far as the criticism of James Corden's slightly over-the-top Broadway queen, as a gay man I had no problem with it. James Corden has a great voice, and I know plenty of gay men who act like that. I also know plenty more gay men who don't act like that, but that's not the point. He played to character. This show made my heart sing, and it was exactly what I needed after this year. The Prom clever escapism done exceptionally well.",The Prom
194,Queenie04,Camp and irresistible!!!,9,17 December 2020,"I don't understand the 1 star reviews, just watching the trailer gives it all away. You know what you're signing up for!! If you dont like musicals, cheesy, camp, singing etc......... Then dont watch it!!! So easy!!Ok so first of all there was a loooot of tears. But let me say this. MERYL STREEP. She is a delight. And I was worried about her performance because Beth Leavel's voice in The original Broadway version is so extra and sharp. And I can't help comparing. But I think she did an amazing job, I was not worried about the acting (obviously she's Meryl) but the singing I mean I know she's a good singer, and it's one thing to sing Mamma Mia but it's another to sing The Lady's Improving!! So 5 stars for Meryl!!I love Nicole Kidman and I think her character was breezy and peachy but I wanted more of her!! I loved her version of Zazz!! But it was not enough screentime!!You know what James Corden didn't even annoy me. Usually he's always hyped up and he gets on my nerve but he was fine this time!! My only issue is that his character could have been played with more depth, but as a straight man I understand he might not have wanted to overdo it. The best thing in my opinion would have been to cast a gay actor.It was basically everything I wanted it to be. So I'm not complaining at all. It was camp and full of sequins!! The Prom scene at the end was shouting DIVERSITY!!!! And I'm loving it, seeing all the Queer kids go to the prom waaaaas sooooooo cute the last 15 minutes I was fully sobbing!!! I think it was just the right amount of humour and the exact right amount of seriousness due to the subject and I think it was sooo beautiful!!!Jo Ellen Pellman was perfect as Emma, her voice is so beautiful and she gave such a strong and emotional performance. It was so well balanced!!Ryan Murphy is really good with colour pattern, all of his shows have this pastel colour theme. This film was pretty much the same, the cinematography is always on point with Ryan Murphy and he did not disappoint!!! It's always so colourful and bold and tacky but in a good way!!The Prom sends a message of self acceptance and tells Queer people to be proud of who they are!!",The Prom

The musical is not one of the greatest ever, but it has the makings of a comedic and fun tale using stereotypical characters. The message is simple: love is love.It's sad to me that the movie is receiving such backlash - the antithesis of the message! It's a tale about love. It's a tale about acceptance. The majority of the characters are created from stereotypes and foolishness.The dancing is not Chicago; the singing isn't Les Miserables.

196,cosmochickita,Stick past first 30 minutes,7,21 December 2020,"My opinion on the various themes I've seen in the reviews :
The first 30 mins are tough: the songs are not really entertaining or specially harmonious so you don't get swept up in anything. So instead, use that time to get excited at the thought of watching a musical (cuz if you don't like musicals or this is your first, this is the wrong one to see), know it gets better and enjoy the visuals and costumes as those are awesome from the startAgain, about the songs: some are great, others really not so good. Generally the ensemble numbers I find are better. I will say though, I find a lot of the lyrics are lame, verses too prescribed just to make the point.The story does seem like it's 10 years too late... but I guess it's the point? This acting group was looking for an ""easy"" cause to get behind because in 2020 how could a community stand by such bigotry when the spotlight is on them? I think? Not sure. I'm sure there are still schools where this could happen, and if so... shame on you, humanity...I see mixed reviews on James Corden, so here's what I'll say a) his accent is REALLY not that bad (In fact, it's fine, it's not like he's forcing a southern accent or anything, he puts on a harmless middle of the road, generic American accent) plus he sings 1/2 the time so you can't even hear it b) his character is really endearing after the first hour c) love that he got the love song at the end during credits shows he really can sing.Quick tangent: James Corden's character's mother thing? Uh huh, it's not that easy... at least put in a line about ""still lots to work out and work to do for him to truly forgive but he missed her and needs his mama""
Nicole Kidman: seriously wtf? She did nothing in this movie, why waste such a great star? It's not her fault, there was nothing for her character (is that supposed to be a reflection of her character's story of always being a chorus girl and not getting the lead?) We know she can sing and dance. Plus story wise: Emma thanks and hugs everyone at the end but never a really moment with Nicole's character, and even the choreography, James dances away from her, she's on the sidelines... even Trent gets two small moments, she gets nothing.Yes. Meryl Streep is fabulous. How can anyone be that perfect that she nails every role? 'Nuff said.Conclusion: This won't win awards. And you have to like musicals to enjoy it. And you may forget it by tomorrow. But while watching, you'll have a good time. Lyrics: not edgy enough. Songs/music: some great, some eh. Dancing: good. Acting: great with what they've been given. Costumes and visuals: everything you could wish for from a campy musical.",The Prom

Great fun. I told my wife I might even want to watch it again... she demurred for herself, but I meant it.
Streep is great, James Corden is fine, and every member of the cast pulls off their roles well.

The fairytale attempt at solving issues that LGBTQ+ people face in their personal lives is. But for the sake of film, that is all fine and dandy. It's supposed to make us feel happy and sad and ultimately root for the characters. The second fault the film has is that it barely focuses on Emma, the main character. It seems like the supporting cast from the gigantic hollywood superstars overshadowed the entire plot of Emma trying to go to Prom with her girlfriend. But it's still worth a watch.

238,griscowsky,Fun and Colorful,7,13 January 2021,"I was a fan of this actually. I like musicals, I like ""feel good"" movies, and I like random dance numbers. I also loved the casting on it, and some musical numbers were unexpected but worked. Loved ""I Just Wanna Dance with You"" and ""Love Thy Neighbor"" and ""Unruly Heart of Mine"" those songs spoke to my sole.I also loved the choreography a lot. Very creative, very fun to watch, and it made me want to hop into the movie and join in too!Throughout the movie I wanted to cry as well. SO many touching moments between friends, family members, and schoolmates. Really important to remember to be kind to everyone and accepting of those who are different then you.",The Prom

240,acjacobsford,"Eh, it's okay",6,13 March 2021,"One of the only movies like this that acknowledges how liberalism doesn't do much to change minds.
It's also not a coming out movie, which is nice, as that has been done too much and doesn't show the true experience.
So, yeah, it's not the best, I'm guessing the musical is better and would be fun to watch. James Corden is kinda annoying, hetero side relationship is boring, it's still kinda forced.
But hell, they finally got queer actors to play queer characters (besides James Corden, seriously, why dude).
I like that the ""gay makeover scene"" is a gay character dressing a gay character. I like Emma's first song.
My liberal family likes it, so it certainly reaches its audience. I hope it hasn't/doesn't win any awards though.
There are much better, more artistic or unique, less flashy and Hollywood, gay movies out there.",The Prom

But I knew a bit of the story so I decided to stick with it. And I was glad I did, because the acting of Ariana DeBose got to me and made me cry as a straight man of over 40. I never saw her before, but she was so real where all the other actors where over the top. If I could give out Oscars, I would give her one. I rarely rewatch scenes, but I did this time, just to appreciate the acting, and I **** cried again.
I also liked the main theme, ""I just want to dance with you"", the rest of the music I don't remember.As her acting could maybe convince people to treat LGBT+ better , it will never be watched by them because of the rest of the film will put them off.",The Prom

If you grew up gay in the 60s and 70s, which I did, and even today there is no semblance of reality in this banal, shallow piece of crap. Ryan Murphy should have his gay card revoked. And, I cannot believe the stellar cast could take any of this seriously. The vanity is intolerable and I don't understand how the cast didn't laugh their asses off at the drivel while they were shooting it, let alone when they read the script. Art does not imitate life in this one. I hope that the gay youth of today don't watch this and believe one iota of it could have any impact on their lives. Truly sad!",The Prom

250,stepea1,Utterly outstanding movie,10,18 December 2020,"I don't normally do reviews but this gem of a movie deserves it .
The cast is perfect . In my opinion James Corden does not deserve the backlash he has from so called critics for portraying a gay character even though he is straight . He played his part brilliantly as did Meryl Streep and everyone else.
I love Musicals and thought I was well up on Broadway and the West End but have to admit I've never heard of this one. I'm glad I do now . This is so funny , Heartwarming and feel good. It had me laughing and Crying too . Very Well done to all involved .",The Prom

257,softanimalbody,You know what? This should be out there.,8,6 August 2021,"It's not amazing. It's a little tone-deaf, and over-simplified. But I WISH there was a movie like this out there for me and my gay friends growing up.We're in our thirties now, and it's tough to take ALL the scenarios LGBTQ+ kids face today and put a face and story to them in one film. The songs are pop and a little saccharine (but not unlike similar musicals like the very successful Hairspray, Little Shop of Horrors, Bye Bye Birdie, Grease, Dear Evan Hansen, The Last Five Years, Baby, etc.) and Meryl Streep is phenomenal as always. I also loved Keegan-Michael Key as a straight ally with a voice. As is I went in with low expectations, sat on the fence for a bit, and came out with the overall feeling of my title and first paragraph. If this movie had been out there when I was in high school, the conversations I've had since the early 2000s with high school friends could have happened a LOT sooner, with a lot more understanding, empathy, and love expressed at a time kids need it most.I appreciated the tongue-in-cheek jabs at celebrity liberals, and how the animosity posed at small towns was also highlighted as being bigoted in its own right. The message overall is to stop making assumptions-whether it's about your Trump-supporting neighbor, or your Biden-supporting other neighbor.Growing up gay, or in the alphabet community, or even as an ally doesn't get solved by a solo on the Internet. BUT films like this will continue to balance out perspectives and understanding, and are important overall.Side note: I don't care at all that James Corden is straight and played a gay man. I don't know any other gays who feel that way either. If a character is being honestly and fully represented on screen, who cares who the originating actor is? It's a CHARACTER. If they successfully fulfill the role of that character, it doesn't matter who that person is in real life.",The Prom

270,matteatch,Not The Musical,8,13 December 2020,"I really loved the stage version of The Prom. This movie does a pretty good job at doing the story justice. Overall I really liked it but I had my issues with it, the whole story line with Barry needing to let his mother back into his life kind of glorifies forgiving toxic people just because they're family, that story line could have been left out and they could have focused more on Emma and Alyssa's relationship, the whole story revolves around them wanting to go to prom together but they don't get nearly enough screen time on their own, much less together. The other problem I had was the fact that a couple of the songs are cut before their over and they sound off, like their cut in the wrong place, and maybe I'm just too used to the Broadway versions of the songs but it didn't work. Despite what this review might seem like I really enjoyed this movie because I never actually got a chance to see the Broadway show live and with Broadway and theatres everywhere still shut down I may never get to see the staged version. So many people can't afford to see live theatre and making this movie gives them a chance. Overall, it's a good movie but, I wish a few things were different.",The Prom

Ryan Murphy gave us a great directing that shows how original he is and how he can be one of the stars without being a character. He could direct this movie with no flaw even though the screenplay gets terrible after the first 30min of movie. The movie falls at some stereotypes and doesn't know how to balance comedy and drama because of it's screenplay (that balance is like, the first thing you need to get so you can make a musical). But in spite of all those things, the movie has a beautiful message, the cast is terrific, especially the female actors (Streep and Pellman) and their co-stars (Washington, Kidman and OMG DeBose)
Ariana DeBose has no screentime at all compared to other actors, but that girl is a star. Blew my mind as Alyssa Greene, and I'm sure she's going to do the same as Anita at Spielberg's West Side Story.",The Prom

Since then, however, I became quite a fan of the original show. I was very disappointed when I learnt some of the first reviews had negative connotations but I went into the cinemas with an open mind and thank god for that. Like always, Ryan Murphy used colour, and lots of it, to his advantage. It gave the set and costumes the feel that was required to suit the actors and the story. The music was amazing but I do not appreciate the cut verses from ""The Acceptance Song"" and ""You Happened"". However, with an already long run-time of over 2 hours, I understand cuts need to be made. Meryl Streep and James Corden did a spectacular job playing the stuck up Broadway stars and the whole cast seemed like they had a tremendous time making it. I feel the whole plot was a little confusing and hard to communicate but this is truly how I wish all movies were made today. It is by no means an Oscar contender but definitely a fun, charismatic pic that will hopefully inspire more films similar to this in the near future.Follow @reviews4musicals on Instagram for more musical content!",The Prom

291,richmondchandler,Feel Good Campy Musical Fun!!!,10,11 December 2020,"I saw ""The Prom"" on Broadway a couple of times, and was so moved by it (as was the whole audience). I told everyone about it, bought all the merchandise, played the soundtrack over and over, etc. Point: I LOVED the Broadway version. So I was super excited to find out that Netflix was making a film version, and have been looking forward to it for a long time.I was a little hesitant when I heard about the decision to cast ""Names"" only in a show that ironically purposely cast a lot of actors who had been in small Broadway roles for years, but never the leads, until now. There are also some incredible vocal numbers that Broadway performers are trained for, and I wasn't sure that the ""Names"" could handle them (with the exception of Andrew Rannells, who became famous due to Broadway). I happy to say that I needn't have worried.All of the actors cast were incredible in their respective roles, did all of the beautiful numbers justice, and brought these characters to life. Yes, it is very campy and over the top, but that's how it was originally written (and done) for Broadway. On purpose, because, campy, flashy, etc. not only makes for a magnificent feast for the eyes (and ears), but it also makes it much easier to digest what are serious issues (Inclusion, Homophobia, Bullying, etc.), without being too preachy or angry. The film is made with the lavish style and camp magic that is a Broadway Musical and embraces that, basically, it's not made to look like a dramatic film, it's meant to look as if you were watching a Broadway show. The original Broadway choreographer, Casey Nicholaw, also choreographed the screen version as well, for example.Keegan-Michael Key actually sings a number called ""We Look To You"" whose lyrics literally explain the reason for a film like this. It's fun, it's moving, it will make you want to sing and dance along, and hopefully appreciate Broadway and Musicals more, and perhaps Celebrate people, and all of their differences as well. Meryl Streep is amazing, as are everyone in the cast. I'm seeing a lot of negativity towards James Corden in reviews, but to his credit, he plays Barry exactly as he should, and he is really heartwarming in what I feel is one of his best performances ever.Watch this film if you love musicals, dancing, big production numbers, optimistic stories with heart and tales of love, acceptance and redemption. I've already watched this film twice, and I will definitely own a copy when it becomes available. I highly recommend this film, especially in these times, as the perfect way to forget your troubles and be really entertained. Trust me, you'll come out of it singing the songs afterwards and just feel happier because of it.",The Prom

For our children's sake, if you're willing to learn some different ways of thinking then it's a good movie. It's feels like an entry level movie to basic humanity.

296,noahpandalover,Conflicted,7,11 December 2020,"I am a massive fan of the Broadway show, and I was looking forward to this movie since it was announced. I didn't think it would be fantastic, but I knew it would be fun to watch, especially as a fan already.And fun it was. As expected, Ryan Murphy really did Ryan Murphy, with all the glitz and glamour, colour, and vibrant look of his work. I do wish it wasn't a Netflix film so I could see it in a cinema (if this was a normal year), because a bigger screen would certainly benefit it.However, it wasn't great. Yes, I had a lot of fun with the film, it was certainly enjoyable. I wanted more Andrew Rannells, and the fact they cut almost all of ""The Acceptance Song"" makes me annoyed, because that is one of my favourites in the show.Additionally, the auto-tuning and overly done pitch correction of many of the actors is hard to listen to. I didn't know Keegan Michael-Key could sing, but the rest of the main cast all can.Love him or hate him, but James Corden can sing. His accent isn't great, overly done in some scenes, but he can sing. He was probably the one I noticed the least editing done on his voice, him and Meryl Streep. Andrew Rannells was in ""Book of Mormon"" on Broadway, he doesn't need his voice altered, nor did Ariana DeBosse, who was in ""Hamilton.""As mentioned, the severely shortened ""The Acceptance Song"" was annoying, as well as cutting Emma and Alyssa's verse from ""You Happened."" I can take changing some lyrics, and while a great joke is removed in one change (""Just Breathe""), it ultimately isn't a big deal. Luckily, no full songs are cut (though I wouldn't have minded the removal of ""Zazz"").The pacing of the film is good, with songs coming in reasonably quick succession. It helps that the musical creators wrote the screenplay, they can make sure the film follows their show from a script perspective. The ability to change scenery a lot mid-song helps at times, but it makes you question Murphy's choices a bit (like, why does part of ""Just Breathe"" take place while Emma is swimming backstroke? Why is she singing then?)Everyone does a fine, competent job, but it isn't a movie that is going to win any Oscars. I had fun watching it, and I went back and watched a few performances again. I would watch it again, but unless I want to hear a little Andrew Rannells, I am sticking with the Broadway cast.",The Prom

300,njporteousbutler,Maybe...?,6,12 December 2020,"The Prom is an interesting film, mostly because it's biggest problem is it's just not long enough. It would have worked better as a series because the runtime didn't allow for character development. There was too many characters which just didn't get long enough to flourish. What we had was less of an arc and more of just a quick transition from narcissist to everything's fine.The main characters I had a problem with were Emma, Barry, Alyssa and Ms. Greene. Emma just didn't have enough depth simply because of the low runtime. Many people can pull into question the casting choices of James Corden, but it could have worked, he just needed to either fully commit to this overt camp character or tone down the campiness so his he could flourish in the role. Instead what happened was a mix of Barry and Corden which felt confused and restricted Barry's character arc. Despite this I'm still a Corden fan and hope he gets a musical role which he can stand out in. Finally Alyssa and Ms.greene. the problem that I had here was first that neither Alyssa or Ms.greene really had enough of a story for the conclusion of their arcs. Also this should have had a better story because they hinted at parental problems throughout, when it finally came to have a mother-daughter relationship on screen we just had the mother immediately change her mind after continually undermining Emma's sexuality and also mistreating her daughter. You could have had the same ending if it was in limited series format and it would have felt like more parts of their relationship and particular themes had been fully explored.It is also worth mentioning that the film didn't fully grasp LGBTQ+ culture and probably could have if it was longer. They could have had something which truly celebrated this but instead they had a short snippet of something so big which only really had stereotypes and clichés. It felt like a missed opportunity.Apart from this the films musical numbers were still fun, the visuals were well done and general I still enjoyed it. It's just there are some looming issues which kind of spoiled it.",The Prom

I will always love James Corden, he has a naturally friendly demeanor. Andrew Ranells I've loved since seeing him on Broadway and the other two well....do I even need to talk about them? Goddesses.

If you like musicals there's no reason not to like this. 2) I'm not giving it a 10 because the message the movie is based on got pretty heavy. Its obviously targeting a specific audience and designed to help turn the tide, so to speak. It was a little too much for me and hubby, it was preaching to the choir at our house.

The homage given was fun and the story line hit the right punches but due to length, a cast that were too recognizable for other similar roles everything feels forced and takes the audience out of the show.

Character build up was overshadowed by the musical of course. There was no back story about Emma's parents or reaction towards her coming out. Chemistry between Emma and Ashley was not shown as much, I wanna see more dynamic of the relationship that makes me feel like ""Yes, do all that to celebrate love"" but it was too minimal. Barry's character was entertaining as well as Dee Dee. But I feel like Angie's character seems more of a filler. We've got Nicole Kidman to play that character, imagine what she could show.I give it a 7/10 because I enjoyed the movie but I wish there were more character build up.",The Prom

Predictable and cliche to a fault - the film missed its opportunity to use more poignant scenes given the main messaging, leading its grandiosity in the production without having much to takeaway from the plot. The conflict (so to speak) was resolved so early on in the film that it just went downhill from there. Just my opinion as I know the movie is still well-loved by many but seriously, that movie didn't have to be 2 hrs and ~15 mins long. Incredibly bland and pretentiously campy.",The Prom

The cast makes it, including Jo Ellen Pellman. These huge stars addressing a serious issue without taking themselves seriously at all was just wonderful.I've loved Streep, Key, Kidman, Corden, and Rannells in other stuff but would never have thought to put them all together. I'm so glad somebody did because the movie couldn't have been cast more perfectly in my opinion, and they all played off each other in the most fabulous way. And Pellman was wonderful as Emma.The dramatic portions were overly sentimental, the comedy expected, and the plot exactly what you think it will be. And I loved every minute of it! I think the movie is exactly what it set out to be and the actors delivered it perfectly.There's a message in the movie but instead of it being pushed in your face, it's just sung right into your heart. The point was to NOT take itself too seriously. I mean, the scripture song in the mall? Come on! And yet it was perfect!I think the main theme in the movie is a vitally important one, but the point couldn't have been made in a more hilariously poignant, fun, feel-good kind of way.",The Prom

James Cordon was uninspiring and he should be kept far away from any future musical adaptations, for the good of humanity. It should be a crime that Andrew Rannells didn't sing every song but I digress. The costumes were all incredible and I hope the wardrobe designer gets a raise.

368,joshuatneedles,So much FUN,10,6 December 2020,"This movie is genuinely so good. Ryan Murphy really delivered. There were a few things going in that I was worried about (namely James Corden playing Barry Glickman rather than Brooks Ashmanskas who absolutely amazed me in the original Broadway cast). However, Corden really delivered the heart of this character so beautifully. Now, Ashmanskas was definitely funnier and still had as much heart as Corden did, but I was in no way disappointed with Corden's performance. I, in fact, really loved it. Meryl Streep is the star of this film. Her acting, singing, and just all around charm is infectious. I could watch this movie JUST for her over and over again. Luckily, I loved the rest of the cast. Andrew Rannells, Nicole Kidman, Kerry Washington, Keegan Michael-Key, and Ariana Debose all gave such heart-felt and honest performances. I GASPED when I saw Kerry Washington's final costume of the film.There is definitely some ""cheese"" in this movie, but I expected that so I wasn't bothered. I enjoyed what was added from Broadway to Screen for the character of Barry Glickman. It is a lot of different characters to follow, but I feel they did a great job of keeping me invested in all of them throughout. Honestly, I really want to go watch it again because it really touched me and made me happy and excited.",The Prom

I really don't know why people are criticizing James Corden. No matter what other people say I thought he was great.

383,adrianpeng-54397,cliches cliches cliches,1,14 December 2020,I just don't know how this movie can help raise attention for the lgbtqia community. You thought it's about the equality issue in the first place and then it started to talk about the narcissism in the produciton industry in the next second with really bad cliche jokes. Plus you really can't cure homophobia with musicals within few days. This movie is a good example for overpresenting and appropriating lgbtqia culture in order to cover up bad screenwriting and cliches.,The Prom

So much emotion from start to finish. Say what you want but I enjoyed watching James Corden in this production.,The Prom

387,jod-24011,It's about time !!,10,15 December 2020,"It's about time that someone is brave enough to call out the hypocrisy of so called Christians, bigots and close minded people. Soooooo tired of the heterocentricity that is so constant in film. The Prom was so very refreshing! But then again I'm biased I guess... I've been out of the suffocating closet since age 13 and longing to see a good show wherein the lesbian doesn't get killed off or portrayed as some evil man hating female but rather as a smart, Thoughtful, courageous person... after all this is how most of us lesbians are in real life. BRAVO!",The Prom
388,hmilanifilho,Couldn't have made my Saturday evening happier,10,16 December 2020,"I must admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Unfortunately, the play did not make it to Australia so I have no comparison basis.
It is as simple story which teaches about tolerance and acceptance, such simple concepts yet widely ignored and the year is 2020!
The cast is engaging, the music and choreography are amazing, it has a good pace and it put some tears in my eyes but mostly big smiles and by the end I was happy and hopeful.
I also loved all the references (either in lines, songs, gestures, etc....) to other musicals.
Not the movie for ""Blood Thirsty Zombies"" or ""Car Exploding"" type movies' lovers, and I can only figure out that the low score will come from this crowd.",The Prom

I was once an LGBT teen growing up in Indiana and a lot of the discrimination she felt I could relate to. The writers did a great job of taking a sensitive topic and showing how hearts can change through comedy and music without being offensive. It was the type of movie that makes you smile and want to get up and dance along.",The Prom

Secondly, I thought they did a great job touching all the very scary and very real problems that people (especially kids/teens) struggle with in the LGBTQ+ community.
And lastly, the bit about cherry picking the Bible is something I've been saying for years. The Bible isn't a choose your own adventure story, if you think so I think you're missing the point. Love. Thy. Neighbor. Above. All.",The Prom

The rest is a message that needs to be sent time and again until the bigots get the message. Great to see James Corden work himself up into a lather, along with the fabulous Nicole Kidman and Andrew Rannells. Honestly, what was there about this production that couldn't be liked? It even kept me awake and interested at 8:30 at night.",The Prom

I love James Corden. He can sing, dance, act and interview. However, the world doesn't need any more Glee episodes. I suppose if the viewer never saw Glee they might like this but for us die hard Glee fans, this is just nothing special and the storyline is the same old thing.",The Prom
402,jadealana,Love it!,10,10 January 2021,I have this a 10 star review bc in this world we are dealing with homophobia and I think that homophobia is wrong. This movie shows that homophobia is bad and people can't help who they love. Everyone should be appreciated the way they are. I am part of the LGBTQ+ community and my dad is homophobic and I can't tell him. Every person in the world should be appreciated for who they are! Btw watch the show. It's so good!,The Prom

Songs were ace and the film was Bright & Bold and Beautiful to behold! It also sends and incredible message of tolerance and acceptance and equality for all, which is still relevant and important in this day and age! And as for James ""stereotypical"" portrayal of a Gay Broadway Star! I thought it was Brilliant! Full of Heart & Humour! What is wrong with a straight man playing an effeminate Gay Man??! They are just as much a part of the Gay community as ""straight"" acting or any acting Gay person. Love Wins! And this film has certainly Won my Love! Thank you Ryan Murphy!!

The story is great, the music is catchy and the lyrics funny and relevant to the story. The actors did a great job and the cinematography is excellent. Loved the use of the blues and purples throughout, and the maddening color schemes of each scene. Sure it's campy and should turn into a cult classic. I'll watch it again and will be a go to when I need some good tunes and happy jaunt in my step.",The Prom

412,jonnydt,Only good thing is the message!,2,28 March 2021,"Unfortunately the film is such a jumbled mess it becomes an exercise in how to tear it apart. The core message is a good one but is dealt with such a heavy hand it pretty much becomes lost. Characters are slotted into old and tied one dimensional stereotypes, even its central protagonists are forced into nearly swiping the message from under the films feet.The cast are given very little to work with here being pushed aside in favour of songs and dancing. Kidman is all but sidelined, Cordon is given a little meat to show he can do emotion, and Streep somehow makes the unlikable likeable.Visually the film is hugely lacklustre, well choreographed dance numbers are shot without any style or imagination making everything feel flat.The music at least has one or two high points, although visually these don't match the content. As a whole the songs do not work to create a consistent tone, making it feel like a rubbish mix tape, rather than a crafted album.The film may not be hateful to watch, but it's self indulgence detracts from its core themesMost annoyingly (and which completely pulls the rug, from the message of the film and it isn't even the films fault) The Prom has been given a 12A when clearly it should be PG (if compared to say Mamma Mia). I can only see one reason for this! And that is more films like this are needed, as homophobia seems to be deep set in the ratings system. Remember kids, you can love anyone you like, as long as you are 12 or above!",The Prom
413,pinkiu-158-792671,Good in parts,5,12 January 2021,"The film was ok in parts I agree with the other reviews as all the songs sound the same and not very memorable. Nothing like Hairspray:
With such high credible actresses, Kidman and Streep I thought it was going to be up there with Showman or Hairspray but it doesn't deliver. On a positive it's easy watching and good story.",The Prom

I didn't love the casting of James Cordon but he actually portrayed the character well and as written, yes it was a stereotype but it's how the character is meant to be.A few of the nest numbers were trimmed for the movie which i didn't love but at least they are on the album.It really is a feel good movie with a important message.

420,debnicke,Relatable & Powerful!,10,19 December 2020,"This movie not only grabbed my attention (as I'm a much older lesbian now), I was emotionally connected as it reflected the story of my teenage years as well as my young adulthood. This is a tear-jerker in some parts as well as exhillerating in others.Growing up in a strict religious family and community during the 80's, I was treated horribly. I was shunned and disowned at 17 yrs old and thrust all alone into a society that never really understood people like me and systemically rejected LGBTQ people. So many of us could never dream of going to their prom; certainly not in any way a straight teenager could enjoy it. After losing our families and friends with not a shred of community help, what is left at such a tender age?This movie delightfully portrayed how our society is slowly changing for the better. I want to buy this movie on DVD, if ever I can! And yes, I give it 10 STARS!",The Prom

422,eliannasemail,Hairspray meets Glee,10,5 October 2021,"If you like light campy socially aware musicals like Hairspray, and LGBTQ teen musicals like Glee, you will love The Prom. It's an old style musical where most of the character development and plot are told through song, so be aware of that and know if that's something you like or not before you watch. Don't expect a ton of deep dynamic character development, or surprising plot twists. That's not what this is for. This is about the warm fuzzies. And it brings ALL the warm fuzzies. If you're a fan of this kind of musical, I dare you to watch this and not end up with a big smile on your face by the end. This is the mashed potatoes of movie musicals. Comfort food in movie musical form. By the second or third time you watch it (and if you like me you will want to rewatch it whenever you're having a rough day) you can sing along to all the songs. It's self-deprecating humor is laugh out loud funny, and it gently mocks pretty much every group so you'll definitely need to bring a sense of humor about yourself to your viewing. I recommend putting on some warm fuzzy pajamas, cuddling up on the sofa with a pizza and some fluffy pillows, and getting ready to fall into the world of old school movie musicals with modern twist for the night. I loved it. My boyfriend loved it. And I hope you will too.",The Prom
423,kipapoiss,Survived 25 minutes.,3,20 December 2020,"I have never been big fan of Ryan Murphy since his movies and series are so similar.

426,takogawa,Amazing vocal engineering - technology driven show,7,10 February 2021,"Overall, a good high-camp entertainment. Nothing deep, just fun-filled joy ride. Perfect movie on TV during the lockdown. Sparkle, dazzle & glitter - you get the idea.I was simply mesmerised by the use of auto-tune, and how ""natural"" (well, not quite - but compared to the vocals in ""Glee"") the processed sound has become.
veryone's voice is so full & rich in tone, plus perfect pitch & timing. And yet they all still sound like their own. No one sounded like android singng heavily manipulated melody lines during post edit.
Total opposite of live performance because everything sounds unrealistically perfect, and that suits this show really well.Songs are ... Ok. It's filled with spoofs of words & melodies we heard before. Dialogue is filled with cliche. A little too much from time to time. But there is no wasteful moment. Every song moves the story forward & to the ending.Not sure if I watch it again, but enjoyed it very much.",The Prom

Another thing was newcomers. Those young actors were brilliant. They sang even better than those big shot stars:)

The actors did a great job singing the songs and saying the lines and genuinely trying to convoy the same sharpness and wit of the stage show. James Cordon in particular, who I normally find over the top and disingenuous, I found to have a grounded and believable performance. However something got lost in the shuffle and there's seems to be a giant hole where the substance of the stage show was ripped out by none other than Ryan Murphey.",The Prom

Meryl Streep continues to show us that she's the best actor on this Earth by taking on the lead role of Broadway Legend Dee Dee Allen. Not only does Streep bring a certain camp to the role she also explores Dee Dee's softer and more vulnerable moments... plus she sings the HELL out of the score.
