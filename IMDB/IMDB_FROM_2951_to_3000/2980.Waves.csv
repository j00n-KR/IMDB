0,SnoopyStyle,family study,8,20 April 2020,"High school senior Tyler Williams is on top of the world. His family is supportive and well off. He has his friends and a beautiful girlfriend. He's a star wrestler at school. His father (Sterling K. Brown) pushes hard but he does it out of concern. A nagging injury turns out to be more. A series of self-inflicted problems and unforeseen difficulties come at him in waves.I like this movie as soon as it starts. It begins with a great cinematic vision. Then it turns into a compelling character study of a family. I am a little conflicted about the divide in the movie. It would have been perfectly great to wrap up the movie soon after the midway point. I do see the value of the change over but it does split the movie in two. Also, it gets a little long at over two hours. It may be worthwhile to give the sister more screen time in the first half. Overall, it's a compelling study of this family.",Waves
1,lee_eisenberg,"good story, poorly recorded sound",8,23 March 2020,"Trey Edward Shults's ""Waves"" looks at how a series of bad decisions affect a family. The movie is like a kick in the gut, with a number of shocking scenes throughout. An unpleasant, but well acted and well directed movie.The movie's problem is the the sound. They use the bass so much that it causes your room to shake, and other times you can barely hear the cast members talking.We can probably ignore that and focus on the story. In that sense, it's probably one of last year's most important movies. I'd say that the most intense performances come from Sterling K. Brown (of ""This Is Us"") and Renée Elise Goldsberry (of ""Hamilton"") as the parents. They want what's best for their children but can be too forceful. Not to subtract from the performances of the younger people. Everything adds up to a fine movie. I recommend it, but just remember that it's like a knife in the stomach.",Waves
2,Quinoa1984,Love and Tragedy and Forgiveness in another A24 Florida film,7,12 December 2019,"And the moral of the story is: Parents - talk to your kids. Like, actually talk to them. Maybe give them a hug every now and again... I mean, don't wait until the absolute worst thing can happen to your family. Do it a little *before* then, kay?This is a powerfully told story that shows a director who may be so creative and full of vigor and energy and ambition with his camera (and good lord, Drew Daniels is flying high and free and ready to take on the world like the apprentice of Emmanuel Lubezki), that his reach may - at times - exceed the grasp of his script. I say at times because this is a bifurcated viewing experience; this is almost two movies smushed together with the first involving a very harrowing, dark, sad and intense downward spiral of a misguided young man (Kelvin Harrison, playing an opposite yet with similar hardcore energy than his character in Luce), and then the second half/the second movie is what happens to the rest of his family (primarily his younger sister) afterwards.I think that Shults has a lot of creative, heartfelt and genuine execution for many of the scenes and moments in the first part of the film, but at core the material is immersed in things we may have seen before, even in After-School specials - domineering (black) dad, drug addiction, pregnancy, hard-pressed-to-the-limit-and-beyond athlete, so much is pumped into the narrative - until it hits the breaking point that I was expecting would happen eventually. I wonder what turns the story could have taken had it not gone SO immesurably tragic (and the chaos that spins out for the character I think gets reflected in the filmmaking, which is commendable and uniquely done, almost like Shults doing his spin on a Fire Walk With Me scenario but for 2019).Then that second part comes, and I appreciated what Shults was doing with the turn into the story, even if it doesn't quite gel altogether (or it's here where it starts to feel its length, a little). He focuses in on the daughter, and a relationship that happens somewhat suddenly with Lucas Hedges, and the actors bring a lot to the table (Taylor Russell does a whole lot with what might be a little on the page, and especially delivers some heartrending moments with Brown when the characters finally have a heart to heart). The only issue is that it all rests on characters who didn't get as much time as they should've (well, Brown did, and he can't help but be great, but his character is painted in broad strokes as Angry-Unable-to-Talk-Dad). I like what he is doing as a filmmaker, which is grappling with this notion of... well, after something like THAT happens, what about everyone else?What Waves becomes then is - and sorry for using this word but I think it works - meditation on grief and forgiveness and trying to connect with someone to, if not mend fences completely, then to start the process. These characters, in all seriousness, could have therapy and most of their problems could be dealt with, but the idea here is almost more Biblical in nature (I don't think it's just there as a dramatic fluorish that the characters go to church, Shults means to take this seriously as a theme). But the reality is they don't and have to reckon with their lives and lots and what they have to do to become whole again. I admire so much of that and the clear passion Shults puts in to this... I just wish it connected for me overall a bit more.I feel almost like a dick criticizing this, as I can picture someone who's 20 years my junior or so who may see this and it could turn them on to filmmaking, or even more profoundly move them to connect with their family members. At the same time, I have to be honest with how it all worked or didn't work. At times, this is emotionally striking and heartbreaking and shocking, and at other times it's a little more basic and the execution can only do so much to rise above the more conventional themes. For all of its flaws though, it is a special picture, and certainly something A24 can be proud of (albeit there is a bit that is CLEARLY a Moonlight reference).",Waves
3,CinemaSerf,"Watchable, but contrived pedestrian tale of suburban Florida",6,27 January 2020,"A rather routine tale of teenage aspiration, angst and (sadly) tragedy which I am afraid to say has been seen many times before. Kelvin Harrison Jnr. portrays a young man who appears to have it all - a top sportsman at school with a beautiful girl on his arm. He develops an injury and it all starts going pear-shaped thereafter. It is almost as if someone had created a checklist of things to start with that can all go wrong and then make a film about it. We have the ""pushy parent""; adoption; race; ambition, drink, drugs, abortion, reconciliation - it's all just a bit too box-ticky for me. Lucas Hedges does manage to bring a bit of geeky charm as he pursues Taylor Russell (""Emilly"" - the younger sister) in the second half of this rather episodic piece of drama. It may well be that this film is more remarkable as it empathises with African-American life as US cinema continues it's reconciliation with a significant part of it's population traditionally neglected, and certainly stereotyped. As a Brit, however, much of that traction is lost and the film boils down to nothing particularly innovative.",Waves
4,evanston_dad,Degrassi High Meets Crash,6,5 December 2019,"There's probably an effective film somewhere amidst the chaos of ""Waves,"" but it's buried underneath undisciplined direction and a determination to knock us out of our seats.Set in suburban, affluent Florida, ""Waves"" is like an episode of Degrassi High married the film ""Crash"" and had babies. After school special trappings and gritty dysfunctional family drama are swirled together in an uneasy mixture that gets more and more preposterous the longer it goes on. In fact, by the time the first half of the film was reaching its climax, I was almost laughing at how hard the film was working to pile calamity on top of calamity. It makes being a high school senior look like navigating Dante's seven layers of Hell, and every terrible thing that a person might have to face over the course of their lifetime happens to an eighteen year old within about a 3-week period.The second half I liked better, mostly because director Trey Edward Shults calms down, but then it gets draggy too with the introduction of yet another character and his story involving a dying, estranged father which goes on forever.There is some good material in ""Waves"" as well as some performances that had the potential to be memorable, but everyone is forced to sustain one long note of intense angst, and I became desensitized after awhile and stopped really caring about what happened to any of the characters.The life illustrated in ""Waves"" doesn't remotely resemble anything like my own. The version of adolescence is far removed from what I directly experienced, and ditto its version of parenthood. I'm not saying this isn't what life is like for a lot of people, but I couldn't relate to it at all. That can be ok -- one of the things I most like about movies is their ability to help me relate to people who aren't like me. But this film didn't do that, probably because it was too busy freaking out.Grade: B-",Waves
5,ferguson-6,two for one,8,27 November 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Whether in sports or music or movies, watching talent blossom and grow is wondrous. For movie lovers, this describes young filmmaker Trey Edward Shults, whose first feature film KRISHA really grabbed me at a film festival in 2016. His follow-up was the critically acclaimed IT COMES AT NIGHT (2017), and now with only his third film, Mr. Shults has delivered an even more ambitious story with wide-reaching impact, yet he remains true to his intimate and personal approach. In fact, with WAVES, he basically delivers two brilliant films in one.A terrific opening credits sequence takes us inside the life of a teenager. There is constant motion, laughter, the longing for independence, and signs of responsibility and structure. Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr, LUCE, 2019) is a high school student, talented athlete, pianist, son, brother, and boyfriend. He's living an upper-middle class life in a beautiful home with his dad (a powerhouse Sterling K Brown), stepmom (Renee Elise Goldsberry), and younger sister Emily (breakout star Taylor Russell). His dad owns a construction company, and is tough and demanding as a parent, incessantly pushing his son to do and be more. His fatherly advice comes in the form of telling Tyler that black men have to work harder than white ones ... never stopping to give praise or affection. He's the type of father who challenges his son to arm wrestle while in a restaurant and critiques his wrestling match victory by telling him the lesser opponent should have been dispatched much quicker. The pressure is relentless, though offered with the best intentions ... a college scholarship and a successful life.Tyler's stepmom is loving and supportive, and his sister Emily is very sweet and quiet, living in the shadows of big brother. Tyler and his girlfriend Alexis (Alexa Demie) seem to have a good relationship and Tyler appears to be dealing with the pressures. But then, as is common with life at this age, things go sideways quickly. A shoulder injury, self-medication, and Alexis' late period bring this ideal world crashing down on Tyler. Just when it seems things can't get worse, they do.Shults' film is really two love stories separated by a tragic line. Whereas the first half belongs to Tyler, the second half is owned by his sister Emily. Dealing with a situation and emotions that should be beyond her maturity level, Emily proves how strong she is, and how the heart can always respond to compassion and caring. She meets one of Tyler's ex-teammates Luke (yet another brilliant Lucas Hedges performance). Luke is socially clumsy and 180 degrees from being a smooth-talker, but he's smitten with Emily and offers her a lovely, if unlikely, companionship. First love is almost always awkward and watching these two navigate is quite charming and heart-warming. A road trip leads to bonding and a better understanding of each other.As the film shifts in focus and tone, characters are pushed to emotional limits. The film offers snapshots of moments without disturbing the flow or Shults' commitment to rich texture. The photography from cinematographer Drew Daniels is creative and varied, and adds much to the presentation. Music is also vital here. The score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adds the perfect touch, and the soundtrack contrasts the tastes of today's generation with what the parents relate to (Dinah Washington's ""What a Difference a Day Makes""), even forming a surprising connection at one point. For other fans of Shults' film KRISHA, you will enjoy a quick scene with Krisha Fairchild as a high school teacher.Proms, pregnancy, parties, pills, and parents are all common topics for films dealing with teens, but this one digs deeper than most. It's based in south Florida and is quite the stylish and heartfelt drama, slicing open the traits that make us human. A lifetime of good decisions builds a foundation, and one or two bad choices can topple all the good ones. When Tyler and his teammates are pumping up before a match with chants of ""I cannot be taken down!"", we all know that life can absolutely take you down. Tyler learns this lesson in the harshest of ways, while his sister Emily deals with the aftermath. Themes of acceptance and forgiveness give this the feeling of the work of a much more experienced filmmaker, but evidently Trey Edward Shults is just this talented.",Waves
6,deloudelouvain,Is it possible to make it more boring? Rigged ratings by the way...,3,24 January 2020,"7.8 is the score this stinker got when I watched it. Another perfect example of a movie with rigged ratings, from people that were asked to give it a high score, from friends of friends of somebody that worked on this movie, and apparently they have alot of friends. Don't get fooled by the positive reviews, they're all fake. There is so much negative things to write about this movie. It's too long (you could skip half of the movie and you still wouldn't have missed anything), it's way too slow (they for sure like to film endless boring scenes where nothing happens), the story is beyond boring, the acting is just okay (nothing special here). The writer/director Trey Edward Shults loves to play with dark scenes illuminated by blue, red or yellow ambient lights which at one point becomes boring to watch, he loves endless scenes of people looking at themselves in the mirror, and he loves really crappy music (is there anything worse than those lousy R'n'B tunes?). All those ingredients made this movie become a snoozefest, one of those movies where you check every fifteen minutes how much longer you have to endure this crap. Note to myself, never watch a movie again from Trey Edward Shults.",Waves
7,blanbrn,Dark family drama of loss and emotions with rage and anger at it's best!,6,8 December 2019,"Everyone knows life is tough with ups and downs with drama and pain as it's rocky just back and fourth like waves in the ocean. Well with ""Waves' these themes are on display very well as this picture follows the lives of one African American Miami, Florida family as director Trey Edward Shults really goes deep with this drama proving that this family has a whirlwind life with twist and turns in it for them.Despite a tough and strict father in the form of Ronald(Sterling K. Brown) his two children spread their wings different ways as the movie is somewhat of a two part thing with different chapters. It involves the son Tyler(Kelvin Harrison Jr.) who has dreams of being a star athlete only a bum shoulder lead to bad decisions of drug use and his life spins even deeper down the tubes when his gal pal becomes knocked up. Then the anger, denial, and rage, leads to a very grim thing and life changing thing for Tyler.Then with young sister Emily(Taylor Russell) seeing the destruction and grave ends she tries to flight a better path in life yet only the scares and wounds will leave lasting marks as the mind never forgets painful memories. Overall well done drama that's a painful journey with all involved as the substance of this film showed it's important to love no matter how bad the situation.",Waves
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Wave after wave.,7,18 January 2020,"'Waves (2019)' is basically two films stuck together, complete with a total shift in protagonist and tone. I mean, it's literally like you're watching one film followed by its sequel. Even within this framework, the flick moves through so many different phases that it's difficult to categorise any given moment, never mind the entire affair. It's unpredictable, for sure. It's also a tour de force of filmmaking, its extremely energetic camera doing things I don't think I've ever seen before. At times, it's like a pure panic attack, disorienting and relentless. Elsewhere, it's completely calm and contemplative. It manages to be a rather emotional experience, despite being sort of disjointed and initially slow. After a certain point, the thing becomes a lot more interesting. Its performances are all absolutely amazing and its cinematography is often stunning. It stays with you, even if you're not quite sure why. It's strange, elusive and undeniably effective. 7/10",Waves
9,ThomasDrufke,Unforgettable,7,16 December 2019,"Waves is a film I don't plan to ever revisit, but I appreciate the heck out of it. Daring, disturbing, and consistently original, Waves will rip your heart out and put it back together within a few scenes. It may not completely work as a finished product, considering it feels like two distinct halves, but it's a film I won't soon forget. In fact, it is most definitely an unforgettable filmgoing experience. Much in the same way that last year's Hereditary was. It's been over a week and I'm still processing what I saw.7.6/10",Waves
10,Cineanalyst,Maundering Moods,6,15 February 2020,"There's some exquisite lighting effects in ""Waves,"" from a crackling fire to police light bars and rainbows, which is complimented by occasionally kinetic montage and hand-held camera movement. Quite a few shots tracking behind figures' heads in this one. And all of the bobbing of the frame coalesces with the rhythm of the soundtrack. The narrative is something of a rigmarole, though. Following the oscillations of a suburban African-American family in crisis, from teenage son wrestler abusing painkillers for his injured shoulder while fighting with his girlfriend over pregnancy, to the daughter dating one of her brother's teammates, I guess, while the father and mother struggle with their relationship and business. The melodramatic climax actually occurs in the middle of the picture, and it's intense. Even the aspect ratio closes in from the usual rectangle to more of a square tending to frame the characters' faces.Yet, tracking the immature emotional waves of teenagers for over two hours, in what is essentially two pictures in one with two separate protagonists, is exhausting. Nary any intellectual engagement is to be had. The score is all over the place and generally prominent. Maybe you'll like the music and maybe you won't, or perhaps you'll be like me and like some it and not the rest. The problem, however, is that the picture relies too heavily upon it. Teens, their music and feelings. Lots of scenes merely of figures riding around in cars. Drama frequently trying to be wrought from texting and social media. When the tortuous theatrics are, at last, wrapped up, it comes as a relief.",Waves
11,westsideschl,Winning,6,25 February 2020,"First, our father coaching his son in wrestling says the goal is to win. I disagree, the goal is to do your best. What the Greeks called Arêté (excellence).
Second, as to the hit. I thought the sentencing was way too harsh given it was his only incidence of that nature & that following the slap he had that momentary loss of control (anger). The supposed emphasis on compassion should have been shown in understanding this event.
Third, as to how the story was presented I thought the excessive use of music (32 songs) took away from the importance of the stories.",Waves
12,vincentlynch-moonoi,Good news / bad news,6,7 December 2020,"There are parts of this film that are superb film-making. The first half of the film is -- for the most part -- gripping. And young Kelvin Harrison turns in a remarkable performance. This is a young actor to watch! Here we see a very promising life crumble before our eyes, and it's all rather logical, not forced. A tragic story. Sometimes a little distraction caused by the visuals that had little to do with the film, but still gripping.Then, about halfway through the film, ""the deed"" is done, and that's where the problem begins. The film seemed to lose focus. Suddenly it wasn't at all about the young, promising athlete...in face, in the second half of the film he seemingly no longer exists...a real shame since he is the strongest actor in the film. The film rambles through a new relationship for the sister, the illness of her boyfriend's father, and this all went on for way too long...really needed some strong editing here. The second half of the film was sort of about the father's failure to be the father he thought he was -- which was interesting, but not strongly focused on; and about the relationship of the stepmother whose life had collapsed...also interesting, but explored in only a shallow manner.Sterling Brown turns in a performance very different than his role in ""This Is Us"", and while good, I felt that the way the director made the film it minimalized Brown's character, even though it was central to the foundation of this particular family.To summarize: great first half with outstanding acting by Kelvin Harrison; the second half just seemed to drift.",Waves
13,ops-52535,"yes , its special",9,19 January 2020,"What a beautiful, devious,exhilerating and strange a drama this flick was. its a heartbreaking story of a familylife, a life that i have not been experiencing myself considering all the steph-roles and invoulantary homecoaching, both as it shows into the film , by father and son.its a journey of brilliant filmographic craftmanship, at times,the transcendent use of flashing colours and blurry images, combined with a soulscoarching and soulsearching kind of score, makes this experience quite dramatic and frantic in its fragility.what is a drawback though is the pace that are on the slow side, and the total playtime is a little bit long.alltough this said, the story may need this time to tuck all its intensity into your emotional gutters, so that you wont forget it that easy.but i am not sure that i, the grumpy old man will remember this one late november 2020, when the oscar statutes are considered, but what i can say from the cold humid northern hemispheres' norway, it is a recommend",Waves

15,eddie_baggins,A uniquely shot and powerful drama,8,9 July 2020,"With his newest film Waves, director Trey Edward Shults has showcased an impressive ability to improve with each singular effort across his three distributed films, as he transforms further into the director he could be with a film bursting with energy, verve and heart, that while not always hitting the emotional highs it goes for, shows itself to be an undeniably unique feature length effort of much creative flair, substance and creativity.Spinning a somewhat typical family drama affair into a whole new direction thanks to its visual tricks and molding together of well-known songs, Drew Daniels color-filled camera work and Trent Reznor's and Atticus Ross's experimental and at times hypnotizing soundtrack, Waves very quickly bypasses the familiar narrative beats it at times follows as Shults bravely gives us a film split into two very distinct portions as it explores the life of South Florida African American family the Williams.Built around Kelvin Harrison Jr.'s high school wrestler and budding sporting star Tyler and Taylor Russell as his younger more softly spoken sister Emily, Waves tackles some weighty issues as Shults and his behind the scenes team build up a serious intensity and emotional surrounding as every camera movement, every blast of ambient sound and every drop of neon-like color helps create a wholly unique movie going experience that is just the type of unexpected and untamed type of imagination that cinema needs in today's more carbon copy playbooks.The visual trickery and flair displayed in almost every scene of Shults film would've amounted to nothing more than a curious experiment had the upcoming talent not been able to craft a suitable tale to enact everything else around but Waves is as competently acted and delivered drama as any other high-profile product of the last 12 months, that fully announces both Harrison Jr and Russell as future stars of the industry.Supported by an awards worthy Sterling K. Brown as Tyler and Emily's father Ronald and yet another fantastic supporting turn from the always great Lucas Hedges, Harrison Jr. who showed serious potential in Shult's last film It Comes at Night and under-seen drama Luce really advances here as the charismatic yet sometimes detestable Tyler, while Russell who is so far best known for her core role in Netflix's Lost in Space and horror outing Escape Room absolutely announces herself here as a major new acting talent in the Hollywood space.It's hard to talk too much about their performances and what their roles require of them without giving away Waves more unexpected movements but suffice to say both actors are universally impressive and quietly heartbreaking in two very differing roles.With so much goodness to be found in this memorable effort, it's also not impossible to see why this highly praised yet also flawed outing failed to break out in the art house circuit upon release or to the surprise of a few pundits failed to secure any major award nominations or recognition, as while Shults should be praised for reaching for the stars, Waves doesn't always come together the way it would've hoped as certain plot developments and failed emotional payoffs hold the film back from becoming the outright classic it comes close to being at particular moments in its runtime.Final Say -Waves is a film unto its own. Taking a seemingly straightforward dramatic family story arc into exciting, dangerous and nerve-wrecking territory, Shults has crafted an impressively staged feature film with some career making acting turns anchoring its runtime and while not everything fits together perfectly, this is a film you won't soon forget.4 manatee's out of 5",Waves

18,paul-allaer,"""true love waits"", and one of the best movies of 2019, period",9,8 December 2019,"""Waves"" (2019 release; 135 min.) brings the story of Tyler, an African-American HS senior somewhere in South Florida. As the movie opens, we get glimpses of Tyler's day-to-day life, going to classes, working out with his varsity wrestling teammates, going out with friends. We also get to know his family: his dad, while domineering, leads a construction company where his mom also works, and his sister is also in HS. And then there is Tyler's beautiful girlfriend Alexis. Then one day during a doctor's visit for a pain in his shoulder, Tyler is told to immediately stop wrestling or his shoulder will never heal. Tyler ignores the advice... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the third movie from writer-director Trey Edward Shults, and this guys just keeps getting better and better: 2015's ""Krisha"" was a promising indie movie, 2017's horror movie ""It Comes At Night"" was a critical and unexpected commercial success, and now this epic drama that frankly blew me away. The movie consists of two parts, the ""before"" and :after"", and of course you are wondering before and after what? Sorry, I'm not going to spoil it. The movie technical features are dazzling: the photography is eye candy, and the sound even more so. In addition to the always impressive score from NIN's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, there are a ton of great song placements. Check out how Shults uses Tame Impala's pulsating ""Be Above It"" early in the movie to maximum effect. When later in the movie we get Amy Winehouse's ""Love Is a Losing Game"", I thought that summed up the film quite well, at least to that point. But it is towards the very end that we get Radiohead's ""True Love Waits"" (the ""Moon Shaped Pool"" version), which truly brings it all home for me. Shults gets great lead performances from Kelvin Harrison Jr. (as Tyler), Taylor Russell (as Tyler's sister Emily) and Sterling Brown (as Tyler's dad). Lucas Hedges (as Tyler's wrestling teammate) gets 5 seconds of screen time in the ""before"" section of the movie, but is front and center in the ""after"" section. What a film and what a viewing experience ""Waves"" turned out to be! I couldn't help but be reminded of Terrence Mallick while watching this.""Waves"" premiered at this year's Telluride film festival to positive acclaim and got a limited release in November. It finally opened this weekend on a handful of screens in Greater Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (about 10 people), which is a darn shame. Hopefully the great word of mouth this movie should generate will result in more foot traffic. If you are interested in an epic family and relationship drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Waves

20,Turfseer,"Dynamic, kinetic look at domestic violence in the first half gives way to lugubrious meditation on loss in the second",5,11 November 2019,"Trey Edward Shults' certainly has come a long way since Krisha, his low budget debut in which he conscripted family members to craft a well received but rather one note meditation on a family outsider. But here with Waves, his universe has expanded exponentially, to the point where he's now grappling with headier themes including domestic violence and the emotional after effects of loss.
The first half of Waves I think is much better than the second. We're introduced to an upper middle class African-American family living in South Florida. The main focus is on high school senior, Tyler Williams (played by Kevin Harrison Jr, who was so good in the recent ""Luce""). Tyler's father Ronald (Sterling K. Brown) goes overboard in pushing his son to become a star wrestler.
Soon a series of events cause Tyler to spiral out of control, leading to a terrible tragedy which not only affects the Williams family, but the entire community as well. Tyler's downward trajectory begins when he injures himself while wrestling and receives a dire prognosis from a doctor who informs him that his career as an athlete is over and he should undergo immediate surgery.
Tyler can't stomach the doctor's grim prognosis and ends up continuing to compete in wrestling matches while in complete denial about this dire condition. It makes sense that he would have this attitude because his father has been pushing him to win at any cost.
To make matters worse, Tyler's girlfriend Alexis informs him that she's pregnant and has decided not to have an abortion (after chickening out during a visit to an abortion clinic). Tyler doesn't want her to have the baby and they argue bitterly. After collapsing during a wrestling match, Tyler completely loses it after Alexis blocks him from texting or chatting on her cell phone. In a blind rage, he confronts her at a high school party and ends up striking her in the head, causing her death.
Shults utilizes a heart-pounding score, mixing both electronic and rap music, to chronicle Tyler's meltdown. It's a visceral experience, akin to watching some of the better music videos which grab you from the start. This is precisely how tragedies occur particularly involving teenagers and domestic violence and Shults is completely on the mark, showing how such sad events basically go down.
This part of the film reaches its climax when Tyler is sentenced to 30 to Life. Except for a brief shot of Tyler now as an inmate at film's end, he's no longer part of the story. Shults shifts to Tyler's sister Emily (Taylor Russell) and follows her as she tries to cope with her feelings of rage toward her brother as well as dealing with the now imperiled relationship between her father and stepmother Catharine (Renée Elise Goldsberry) who blames her Dad for driving Tyler to commit his insane act. Emily also blames herself for not stopping Tyler from killing Alexis, as she was there when Tyler showed up at the party.
Emily begins to heal when she gets involved with Luke (Lucas Hedges), who also must cope with the imminent loss of his estranged father, now dying of cancer. Encouraging Luke to go and see his dying father helps her to realize that only through forgiveness can true healing take place. It's a heartfelt sentiment, but Shults drags out the relationship between the new lovers, to the point of tediousness. Unfortunately Emily and Luke are not very interesting characters and there's not enough conflict between them to keep our interest.
There are a few sparks between Ronald and Catharine, who now wants nothing to do with him due to the previously alluded to pressure he placed on Tyler growing up. They of course have to find ""the road back"" too and rather predictably they do, at film's end. All the while, there is little opportunity for character development.
Ultimately Stults is much more attuned to emotional beats than a narrative that appeals to the intellect. Some may find his exploration of how people cope with loss to be quite satisfying but others such as myself don't have the patience to sit through the lugubrious pacing. What's more, characters end up being defined by one external situation (Alexis' murder) and don't develop organically. Simply put, Waves is melodrama incarnate. For some, all the angst may be cathartic but aside from the neat, kinetic machinations up to the midpoint, much of what we see next has been done before and is a bit disappointing.
Stults should reflect on this effort as another learning experience. What worked so well in the first half was the fact that his story was fraught with conflict. In the second half, most of the conflict dried up; in its place was the rather predictable optimistic resolution of characters overcoming loss (Emily even visits her incarcerated brother at film's end!). Fledgling filmmakers still need something more unique and less predictable if they plan to make their mark in the world of cinema.",Waves

Such as, overuse of the super annoying light blinking scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the close-up facial scene, and overuse of the head put outside the car's window scene! Barely intense scene is, Tyler argue with Alexis, and Tyler eventually kill Alexis by accidentally push her on the floor! At the end, Emily dating with Luke! Tyler serving his life sentence!

23,valleyjohn,A Beautiful journey,8,27 February 2021,"Waves is a superb film that follows the life of a suburban family through their ups and downs of life .This is a film about loss , Love , grief and addiction.
It's about dealing ( or not ) with the stresses in life and how it's rare that children learn from the mistake of of their parents .I felt this film always had the feeling of impeding doom . As if something really bad was just about to happen and that kind of made it in feel almost hypnotic.
That hypnotic feeling was helped also because of some amazing cinematography.
The aspect ratio would change when things were not going well , giving a feeling of cinematic claustrophobia.
The soundtrack complimented the cinematography as well.The acting was fantastic. The cast laid everything bare for everyone to see and I was especially impressed with Kelvin Harrison Jr and Taylor Russell who played the brother and sister.Waves is a hidden gem and should be sought out by everyone if possible.",Waves
24,truemythmedia,Why Did This Movie Get So Little Love?,10,27 February 2020,"Wow! I was not expecting to have to adjust my Top 10 picks for 2019 but I just might have to after finally seeing ""Waves,"" albeit a little later than I wanted. I just wasn't expecting to like it so much being the follow-up for Trey Edwards Shults' ""It Comes at Night"" which I did not enjoy.""Waves,"" however, ticked all my boxes. From a narrative that is more driven by character than plot to cinematography which reinforces the themes of the film to just a couple scenes of high school wrestling (a sport I participated in and which is also criminally under represented) this film, in any other year than 2019, would have been my favorite film of the year.Beginning with the acting and characters, I have to say that every actor delivers raw performances that feel incredibly authentic. The movie focuses on an African American family but it was written by white man and so has drawn some ire from well intention-ed watchers of the movie but I have to say that everything that I saw in the film, watched in interviews with him and his African American cast, and read about in articles leads me to believe that he did a fantastic job of owning his limitations and reaching out and trusting the voices of his actors to ensure that the voices seemed as authentic as possible.I want to pick out a performance and say something like Sterling K. Brown (""Black Panther,"" 2018) is a stand out among a well performing cast but I just can't. The ENTIRE cast does an amazing job and while each one has scenes or aspects that I would highlight, I would only be doing so at the expense of other great actors and performances. This is an especially admirable feat as many of the characters are young, which can sometimes be a pitfall for a serious film.Another thing I like about this film, and feel is likely to be the least talked about aspect of it, is the sweeping scope of it. Essentially, the film is a family tragedy/recovery story which could have been shot and acted as cheesy melodrama. However, ""Waves"" has a sweeping feel to it like you are not just watching the story of one family but of all families akin to ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" where one couple seems to stand in for many African American couples. Here, our family seems to represent almost any family in America. Even though it is about an African American family and they deal with specific problems, at times, which I will never have to deal with as a white man the moments where I felt myself identifying with the sentiments and feelings of the characters were almost constant.I believe that this is because none of the particularly African American experiences were framed as being the experiences of certain people of a certain race. They were framed as the problems of human beings. I may see the father in this film as overbearing but he says some things which hit hard to my core like, 'We gotta work 100 times harder to get anywhere.' That is a particular feeling of American Black culture that I will never really know in the way they do but it sounds like my coach in high school and teachers I have had. It has me recalling those feelings of weakness in the face of tremendous odds, a mentor aided push to the next level, and a desire to never disappoint someone who would be that real with me.The narrative of this film does an excellent job of replicating the way that reality feels. People we love do terrible things, people keep things inside where they can destroy rather than opening themselves up to shame, and it takes more than one event or kind word to bring catharsis after pain. One of the reasons these things work so well is that the events that happen to these characters feel, at the same time, both the sole result of our characters understandable actions and reactions as well as totally out of any one person's control. This reflection of life as being in our own power to direct but also the product of the whims of fate is something that anyone can understand and identify with. This experience is true to people whether they are black or white, male/female/trans/etc., Christian/Muslim/Jewish/Hindu/etc., rich or poor.I heartily recommend this film as I think it speaks to issues that are very human and universal in a way that few films, save the great masterpieces, even attempt. This one not only set it's bar higher than most films, it cleared that bar with beauty, grit, and grace.",Waves
25,jadepietro,The Ripple Effect,6,11 December 2019,"GRADE: C+THE FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite all of its good intentions and strong acting, the film can't explain some sloppy storytelling and contrived visuals.JIM'S REVIEW: In the independent film, Waves, director / writer Trey Edward Shults has created a drama that deals with a well-to-do black family that somehow loses its way, just like its talented filmmaker. The storytelling is always compelling, but its episodic structure and showy direction complicate a narrative filled with too many subplots.At first glance, all looks very copacetic in the Taylor family. Son Tyler is a good-looking and popular teenage jock with a loving cheerleader girlfriend and a promising wrestling career. Daughter Emily is a kind and quiet student who avoids the limelight. Stepmother Catherine keeps everyone happy while Father Ronald oversees his son's sport life with a strong and domineering hand. All this happiness is about to come to an abrupt end.For a while, moviegoers experiencing this earnest and serious-minded movie are kept guessing and caught completely off-guard with the series of unfortunate events that befalls this clan. We slowly discover that Tyler's drug-fueled behavior will cause a ripple effect on everyone involved. While the film firmly establishes teen pressure, its unguarded sense of immortality, and their privileged and self-absorbed lives, some of characters' actions and their logical repercussions are left unanswered. As the film progresses to its tragic conclusion, the storytelling begins to lack focus and cohesion, going off on tangents and never recovering from its melodramatic flourishes.The visual look of the film does not help matters. The film is poorly shot by Drew Daniels, with lots of annoying kinetic camerawork and contived colorful transitions that do little to enhance the movie. The editing by Isaac Hagy and Mr. Shults is choppy and abruptly changes screen formats for no good reason. There is a busyness that seems desperate. It's almost as if the director within Mr. Shults didn't trust his inner screenwriter.This makes the whole venture all the more disappointing because the initial story is truly interesting and worthwhile. Especially, with its terrific cast on board. Kelvin Harrison and Taylor Russell are excellent and quite convincing in their challenging roles. Renée Elise Goldberry and Sterling K. Brown provide very strong support, but one wishes there was more screen time given to their characters for clarity sake. Lucas Hedges and Alexis Demie are also fine as the younger Taylors' love interests.Still, Mr. Shults' screenplay remains too locked into the siblings' secret lives while their unsuspecting parents go completely AWOL and literally out of the picture for long stretches of time. Several necessary scenes clarifying their relationship are also missing in action and seem to be sketchy at best. These omissions in storytelling and character development dissipate the turmoil of the family dynamics, making one wonder why certain actions by the film's characters are never fully addressed. One also regrets what this film could have been with just a few more rewrites.Waves is meant to wash over you with its dramatic intent. But, despite the powerful acting, it's just a wash.",Waves
26,Xstal,Powerfully Reflective & Thoughtful...,8,29 April 2020,"This treasure of a film explores the emotions, circumstance and consequence after a moment of chaos, that moment when in an instant the world begins to crumble and the lives and directions of so many are instantly and irredeemably altered. An original story, beautifully shot, elegantly performed and imaginatively directed. Left me asking the question: are any of us as bad as our worst fifteen minutes?",Waves
27,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Really good, so hopefully won't be too overlooked",8,21 February 2020,"Waves is a film that seems to have been somewhat buried under a host of other strong releases from 2019; particularly its last couple of months, around awards season. It may have been this release date that has made it overlooked, with it failing to make the sort of impact that even the director's previous (and rather divisive) film It Comes At Night seemed to make. I think it deserves attention though, even with all the other great films recently released, especially because it marks a significant improvement on that previous film.On a technical front, Waves is impressive, although it is worth mentioning that it's made in a way that calls attention to itself and the filmmaking. Doing this in itself is not automatically a bad thing, as directors like Paul Thomas Anderson and Martin Scorsese have proven. In Shults' case, he draws attention to his craft through the shifting aspect ratio, the bold lighting, eye-catching use of strong colours, and a diverse, frequently front and centre soundtrack of contemporary alternative and rap music. The showiness of the direction and construction of the film wasn't a turn-off for me, because these techniques were mostly used to serve either a story or character purpose, and thankfully done in a way that was visually/aurally pleasing. These bold directorial choices could be distracting or even detrimental to some viewers, but hopefully not most, and I'll certainly count myself among the people who enjoyed such choices. It felt like the best student film (and then some) I've ever seen given a decent budget before being stretched to feature length (okay not quite, but hopefully that goes some way towards illustrating my rather ridiculous point).The narrative is compelling, and in some ways quite straightforward, yet in other ways a little twisty and unpredictable, so the less said about it the better. It's best to see it unfold and let it affect you at its own pace, but vaguely speaking, it's a well-told story about a family dealing with each other and the various hardships they're facing in their lives. I feel as though there'd be a lot more to unpack narrative-wise through rewatches, which makes me keen to see this again one day. Also worth praising is the acting, with Kevin Harrison Jr. and Taylor Russell being particularly impressive, likely both with promising careers ahead of them after giving intense performances filled with emotional range in this film.Waves is long and intense in parts, and may feel distracting for some viewers due to its direction, visuals, and style, but it's a ride worth taking because there is a great deal to be impressed by here. I can't give it a glowing recommendation for absolutely everybody, but would imagine that for most viewers it's worth a shot. I found a lot to like and am confident my feelings towards this film will grow even more positive in time, and more still after a rewatch. Don't let the fact that few people are talking about this fool you: this was one of 2019's boldest, freshest, and most interesting films, and deserves a whole lot more attention and discussion than it's so far received.",Waves

29,rockman182,Waves (2019),8,17 November 2019,"Here is a film that kind of came out of nowhere, with not a lot of buzz. Trey Edward Schults returns with his follow up to It Comes at Night. There were aspects of It Comes at Night that were really admirable though I felt it didn't really reach its heights. However, with Waves comes an absolutely alluring sensational experience. Its absolutely raw and the way in which it is presented adds to a completely engorging experience at the theaters.The film is broken up into two segments. The first is about a teenager with so much potential. He is a star on the wrestling team, has a great girlfriend, and a family who support him (albeit his father pressuring him to succeed). Slowly, things start unraveling and events transpire that drastically change things for him. The second part of the film is seen from his sisters point of view and her struggles with coming to grips with events in her own life and the weight put on by family.From the opening minute of the film with the bright sunny Florida water and the camera circling around inside the car, you can tell you are settled in for a visual joy. The film is shot beautifully for the most part and it is vibrant and triggers your senses. The aspect ratio changes throughout which I found a little odd but I'm sure its too enhance parts of the story. The score is fantastic and at times foreboding. The entire first half of the film is jaw dropping good. Its insane but a tremendous watch.The film slows down in its second part but its still great and appeals to the emotional element of the first half of the film. The film feels longer in its second half despite flying by in the first. Overall, this is a very impressive effort from Schults and puts him on my radar because it shows that he is extremely capable of telling and showing a story creatively. I hope this picks up more buzz as weeks go by because it was a very interesting watch.8/10",Waves
30,kjproulx,This Film Tore My Heart Out,10,13 September 2019,"I've said this before, but I will also never be tired of saying it; A24 is easily the best studio out there today, in terms of releasing quality content. Their endless devotion to finding original and exciting projects has always been an admiration of mine. Each year, they seem to be building a bigger catalogue of movies. Waves is one of their latest films to be produced and will hit theatres this November. Here's why, even though it may be a tough pill to swallow at times, you should absolutely be seeking it out.I will start off and say that I'm going to keep the premise very brief, because it's the type of film that consistently surprises its audience, becoming a completely different film by the end. For this reason alone, I'll simply say that Waves is a film about a relationship and a family who slowly falls apart in unexpected ways. I was incredibly invested in the set-up for this film and all of the characters in it, so when a certain moment occurs, I was floored. This movie moved me to tears in ways that I never thought it would.Written and directed by Trey Edward Shultz (It Comes at Night, Krisha), he very carefully crafts this story in a way that feels true to life, while also having levity in times of crisis or grief. On top of the stellar writing and direction, the cinematography by Drew Daniels, who happens to have worked with this director for years, is out of this world. From the way the camera spins to tell a story or frames things perfectly for an aspect ratio change, I would be shocked if Daniels isn't talked about for his work here.It goes without saying that Sterling K. Brown has deliver an amazing performance, and his work here is nothing short of that word. I believe he will be recognized for awards this coming season, but I would like to mention Taylor Russell as well. Playing sort of the backbone of this family, her character has a lot on her shoulders and there are a few scenes where she absolutely steals the show. Alexa Demie, Kelin Harrison Jr., and Renée Elise Goldsberry are all terrific as well, but there was just something I couldn't put my finger on when watching Waves unfold.135 minutes doesn't seem too long for a film in hindsight, but the way this story plays out will probably make some audiences impatient. There are a couple of instances when this movie feels like it ends, but there's still a lot left to explore. Looking back on this possible negative though, I feel that a rewatch may have me forgiving that aspect, and that has everything to do with the score. Even in the moments where a movie like this would seem to drag, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide a pulse-pounding score that will keep you invested, even during the slow moments in this family's life.In the end, for what Waves sets out to be, it's nearly perfect. The route this film takes toward the end will probably not sit well with some viewers, but that aspect is what impacted me the most and took the film from great to incredible. It can be quite upsetting and depressing at times, so if you're not into that, I would suggest looking for a different film. With that said, this is easily one of the best movies I've seen in 2019 and I can't see myself changing my mind on that. This movie is a human drama that just goes for it and it tore a hole in my heart by the end. Waves is stellar.",Waves

It felt like the (spoilers) arrest and incarceration of Tyler was the end of it, but we got knocked into this completely new movie within the movie, where the producers looked at the aftermath. And it kind of ruined the film for me. I have no clue what minds are behind A24, but wow, This movie was a total letdown, I usually like what A24 produces, but this thing was just a 2 hour music video. Crying and music. With barely any dialogue at all. Can't recommend. 5/10 score. But in this movie, when Tyler looked at her photo in prison, this feeling was conveyed without any dialogue, such a popular concept, but one that has never reached me, but here, for whatever reason. I have NO idea what this movie is supposed to be about, ALL I see is an EXTREMELY DEPRESSING movie about literally nothing.",Waves

He's pushing himself too hard and suffers a shoulder injury but disregards the warning of a doctor, he always wants to live up to his father's expectations so takes painkillers rather than talk to him about this. His mother isn't is natural mother, so that's probably the reason why can't talk to her either.His girlfriend falls pregnant, the question of abortion comes up, he's responsible for a tragic accident, and is found guilty of her murder and imprisoned.

33,Alexander_Blanchett,Emotional and beautifully acted,8,25 January 2020,"Very good character and family drama about an upper class family. The film focuses on the two teenage children of the family and is told in two parts. The first part is definitely the stronger part. It is about the son, wonderfully played by Kelvin Harrison Jr. who really turns into a fantastic performance. The story really shows fantastic character development and an interesting story of a young man on the edge to break together. The second part suffers a bit from two rather uninteresting protagonists. While Taylor Russell really gives a good performance and makes the very best out of her character, the role itself is not so exciting as there is hardly any development. Also Lucas Hedges' role is rather uninteresting, although it had potential. His performance is not really great either.
In the middle of both we have Sterling K. Brown and Renée Elise Goldsbery who both give Top 10 performances. Brown convinces as the strict but good hearted father and Goldsberry is the loving and sensitive mother.
The story is excellently written and directed and absolutely convinces with his original and unique cinematography and its unexpected use of colors. This is absolutely award worthy and underrated. Same goes to the editing that wonderfully puts the film together linked with a fantastic and very related soundtrack. Those were the masterful parts of the film. I just wish the second half would have been as great as the first, so the film really could have ended up as a masterpiece. Still what it tries to tell us is important.... healing just works with forgiveness and this is a powerful and very relevant message.",Waves

It's the type of film that if one sees it in their youth, it could change how you view movies, art...life.I will say nothing more about Waves except it is an absolute must-see, and if it finds its audience, it has the chance to be a generational touchstone film.",Waves
35,ronakkotian,Raw and poignant,9,25 January 2020,"A24 is the best film company right now in my opinion. Whilst their films don't earn much money, the quality of them beats any big Hollywood film. Waves is an experience that not many people will witness but the people who did will find it insane.Waves looks at the breaking of a family and the effect it has on them.After seeing Waves, I became increasingly excited to see more of Trey Edward Shults's work. This is a stunning film with scenes that can tear you apart in an instant. The visuals are amazing to look at and the use of colour to establish a character's emotions is exceptionally done. There are some impressive 360 degree shots inside of a car that make the scene look really stylish and immerses you into the film. However, the film never becomes style over substance due to Shults's incredible writing. The way he grounds this movie and its characters into reality without being too over the top or dramatic makes everything that takes place believable allowing the audience to feel the emotion in every heartbreaking scene.The acting is solid throughout. Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Taylor Russell give outstanding performances both of which will stick with you for a while. Sterling K. Brown is also fantastic in this role and even Lucas Hedges, who I didn't like in Three Billboards, fit well into his character. Every actor in this film felt real and you are able to buy them as these people because of how strong their performances were.An integral part of this movie is the music which I thought was handled immensely well. The music choices never felt out of place and added a huge punch to the scenes it was playing in. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is very edgy, brings a certain atmosphere to each scene and doesn't feel overpowering in any way. The film also goes through several changes in the aspect ratio which made me think why Shults decided to add this but I've come to the conclusion that the changing aspect ratios do feel purposeful. They really contribute to the emotion felt during the scene and tell the story in its own way.Overall, Waves is a film that I would definitely recommend. It's very experimental in terms of its presentation and I think Shults managed to pull it off. Some people may complain with how the film is structured and it does feel weird at first but it all comes together very nicely. Shults is a director that's definitely on the rise and I can't wait to see his previous work: It Comes at Night and Krisha.",Waves

The visuals were very good and one of the best cinematography I have seen this year. The music was also very good. The movie has two sides and I liked both these sides equally.

38,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,The most devastating film of 2019 - CRUSHING,10,11 December 2019,"It's Oscar season, and so my ex girlfriend and I have been hitting the theaters every few days together. We saw Honey Boy, Queen & Slim, and Ford v. Ferrari all in a week. They were all great movies but it seemed she was rather underwhelmed by all of them. Why? Because she had seen WAVES the week prior. She kept suggesting how heavy it was, that when her and friend left the theater they didn't know what to do with themselves. ""You love really heavy movies - you have to see it"". A couple days later, two more people said basically the exact same thing to me.Well, now I know why she was underwhelmed with the others. WAVES is an absolute CRUSHER. I wasn't super interested before hearing anything about it from personal friends because the trailer made it look far too much like a Moonlight wannabe (another phenomenal movie - but it seemed TOO similar). WAVES is a very stylish film visually, which features a predominately black cast, and which is extremely dramatic with it's content - but that's where the similarities end. Where Moonlight focuses on growing up struggling and in poverty, Waves focuses on a relatively well-off family in a Floridian suburb, seemingly a really nice part of town. The entire primary cast absolutely KILLS it and I believe it will be majorly career-building, possibly elevating any one of these fine folks to star-level status very quickly, especially leads Kelvin Harrison Jr., the endearing Taylor Russell, and the absolutely colossal performance by Sterling K. Brown as their father. Lucas Hedges also did really fine work, portraying a character that is almost the polar opposite of his aggressive, manic interpretation of Shia LeBouf in Honey Boy.The movie is about 2 hours and 15 minutes but only slows down for about 15 minutes when you aren't sure where the story is going to go after some very massive plot elements unfold and shift. It is immensely gripping through the majority of the runtime, and if you're a sensitive softy, it's highly likely you're going to cry your eyes out at this one like I did. Everything that happens is extremely raw, and real - it feels progressive and simple at the same time, never too predictable OR unpredictable. You might know what's going to happen next, but the thought of such things will fill your with nervousness, and perhaps even fear. And it's an intense film, with heart as the entree but COATED in pain as it's sauce. There is beauty in the darkness but one must experience all the pain to get to the light at the end.The soundtrack was also fantastic. A killer blend of tasteful modern hip hop cuts, with choice cuts by hipster-era indie darlings such as Animal Collective, Radiohead, and Tame Impala, featuring some cut-up dark remixed versions of their tracks, assumedly done by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, who also did some scoring work for the film. There was even a classic Buttons track in there, one of the best contemporary electronic outfits around. Every song fits in impeccably with it's scene - really ace music supervising on this one.Beautiful cinematography & lighting. Impressive editing with great flow.This is Top 3 films of 2019 for me. Pure drama does not get better than this.",Waves

There is an awkward, yet endearing, sexual encounter that I related to in a way that summoned a deluge of different emotions: a little cringe-inducing, then a little funny and warm, and ultimately oddly nostalgic.Moments like this (a scene from Lady Bird, another A24 film, also comes to mind, although it doesn't end as sweetly) are so much more interesting than garden-variety sex scenes that are just, well, sexy. Waves, directed by Trey Edward Shults (It Comes at Night), is as dreamily beautiful to look at as it is vividly real. It doesn't hurt that the film is, to quote Justin Chang, ""deeply rooted in its characters' consciousness"". Even the most horrid characters can be understood, and nonetheless recognized as human beings.Most important on the cast, which has no shortage of stellar performances, is initially Kelvin Harrison Jr. as high school senior and wrestler Tyler Williams, who suffers from a physical ailment that he keeps secret so as to continue sporting, even stealing painkillers from his father (Sterling K. Brown), who accepts nothing less than greatness from his son. The supporting actors include Taylor Russell, Lucas Hedges, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Alexa Demie, and Clifton Collins Jr., none missing a beat. This, strangely, goes for the Harmony Korine cameo as well.Further difficulties arise for Tyler when his girlfriend Alexis (Demie) unexpectedly becomes pregnant; Tyler rejects the idea of parenthood at his age (and in his life situation). Turbulence occurs between the two as Tyler surrenders to narcotics and alcoholism, and things soon turn uglier in ways I dare not reveal.As mentioned above, this movie has grounded beauty and sweetness, but indeed, it also ruthlessly portrays the consequences of the bad choices humans are prone to. Some of these, I've noted, are emblematic of a defiant generation; especially younger folk and their indifference to what their future may hold, should they not drop the idea that they're invulnerable. But as Brian Tallerico mentioned when discussing how the film is titled, waves do recede back into the ocean. There will be a chance to get out of the way before the next one crashes, even if you can't undo the previous one. I don't advocate that one ""needs"" to do this and that to lead a correct life, but there exist rational methods of navigation.Again, much of the film's impact is in those little touches that Shults is permitted to include when enabled by such guardians of creativity as A24. It may the body language and emotions on display during an awkward date proposal, or the anxiety of those little dot graphics that appear when you're texting your girlfriend about something serious, awaiting a response. Shults knows just what to show.It is inevitable to also bring up the visuals when praising this movie; the part that makes this otherwise grounded and biting movie fantastical. In addition to breathtakingly beautiful and often nifty photography, Shults has a peculiar way of subtly using a film's aspect ratio to set the mood (comparable to Xavier Dolan's 2013 flick Tom at the Farm). Waves is no exception, and it all fits well with Trent Reznor's score and the remainder of the soundtrack.It also has distinct color schemes, mainly featuring strong reds and blues. To tell you my opinion on what this might communicate about the different characters, I will need to see the film again, which I am excited about already. I can say this: in a sense, these two colors foreshadow Tyler's fate.Critics I trust in were banking on this to be the Moonlight of Shults' career; a gorgeously crafted ""black film"" that constitutes his overdue ticket to the Oscars. It being snubbed was quite a shock, but I will be using my homeland's release date as an excuse to include Waves on my forthcoming 2020 list, in lieu of a spot on my 2019 list. After letting this film sit, however, it's possible an actual revision will be in order for my ""40 Favorite Films of the Decade"" listicle (which uses more accurate dates and should probably include Little Women, which I also saw in 2020, anyhow). This is quite a movie.",Waves

46,Bertaut,"Bleak, but never despondent; audacious and confidant filmmaking",8,7 February 2020,"Writer/director Trey Edward Shults's previous films, the unconventional Thanksgiving drama Krisha (2015) and the brilliant but poorly marketed post-apocalyptic thriller It Comes at Night (2017) would seem to have little in common with the more social realist concerns of Waves. However, all three share the same thematic DNA, focusing as they do on a family under intense pressure. And as with those films, if you're into formalism, you'll find plenty here to keep you happy; elaborate camera moves, varying aspect ratios, unusual colour correction, striking shot composition, a sound design which bleeds into the soundtrack/score (and vice versa), a quite audacious shift in focalisation at the half-way point, and a stunningly concise closing shot. On the other hand, it's emotionally bruising and takes its sweet time getting anywhere. It also asks much more of the viewer than your average Marvel movie, and some simply won't want to put in the legwork. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but if you consider cinema as entertainment only, I'd imagine Waves will leave you bored and frustrated. However, if you have the patience and are willing to take the journey on which the film wants to bring you, the cathartic rewards are many.In a middle-class suburb in Florida, Tyler Williams (a brilliant Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is a popular high school senior and skilled wrestler, who is deeply in love with his girlfriend Alexis Lopez (Alexa Demie). At home, he has a good relationship with his sister Emily (a heartbreakingly sweet Taylor Russell) and stepmother Catherine (Renée Elise Goldsberry). However, his relationship with his domineering father Ronald (a sternly intimidating Sterling K. Brown in full-on stare mode) is somewhat strained due to Ronald, himself a former athlete who was forced to retire due to a knee injury, constantly pushing him to succeed. As the film begins, Tyler's shoulder is causing him problems, and although he keeps it a secret, he soon learns he has a Level 5 SLAP tear, with his doctor telling him he'll need surgery and a few months off from wrestling, or the damage will become permanent. However, he ignores the doctor's advice, continuing to wrestle and starting to self-medicate with Ronald's painkillers. Meanwhile, he becomes increasingly acerbic and starts drinking heavily. At around the half-way point of the film, the focalisation then shifts to the shy and socially awkward Emily, looking at her burgeoning romance with Tyler's wrestling teammate Luke (a passive and pensive Lucas Hedges). Meanwhile, the Williams family must try to come to terms with a horrific act of violence that could change all of their lives.The most noticeable thing about Waves is the aesthetic audaciousness. What's especially interesting about the narrative bifurcation is that Emily barely appears in the first half and Tyler barely appears in the second, forcing the audience to completely recalibrate themselves vis-à-vis the film's milieu. However, for all its narrative gymnastics, it's Waves's visuals that really pop. Working with his regular cinematographer Drew Daniels, no matter how elaborate Shults's use of form becomes, it's always in service of the story, with the camera being used thematically rather than as a passive tool of observation. For example, the opening shot is inside a car occupied by Tyler and Alexis, but rather than shoot the scene in a shot/counter-shot format, Shults positions the camera between the duo, spinning in circles, and completing multiple 360-degree rotations. This immediately inculcates us into their sense of abandonment and exuberance. Before a single line of dialogue has been spoken, Shults has already started telling us who these people are. It's pure visual storytelling, showing rather telling.This kind of form/content correlation occurs throughout the film. For example, in the first half, which is focalised by the restless and propulsive Tyler, the handheld camera rarely stops moving, reflecting his frenetic energy. However, when we shift to the quieter and more withdrawn Emily, Shults uses more static tripod shots and a much slower editing rhythm, which reflects Emily's calmer disposition. He also has the palette reflect this shift - whereas the first half is awash in garish blues, reds, and greens, the second has a more naturalistic look. A crucial part of the film's visual identity is the very unusual use of aspect ratio(s). Beginning in 1.85:1, the frame gradually reduces in width until it gets to 1.33:1, which is how Tyler's section ends. Then, at the start of Emily's section, it starts to widen again, eventually reaching 2.35:1. The narrowing ratio of the first half reflects how Tyler feels he's being progressively trapped as things continue to go wrong, whilst the widening ratio of the second half reflects Emily's determination to recover from tragedy and reconcile her family. In short, the first half symbolises an ever-increasing restriction, the second half a gradually discovered freedom.And all of this is to say nothing of the diegetic lighting, the shot compositions and camera blocking, or the blending of Johnnie Burn's immersive sound design, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's discordant score, and the exceptional 32-song soundtrack.Thematically, the film looks at the pressure to succeed, particularly in men. Ronald equates masculinity with strength, mocks Catherine's job, and barely acknowledges Emily. Instead, he pours all his effort into Tyler, through whom he's trying to live vicariously, pushing him to be the successful athlete that he himself could have been before injury ended his career. He's also acutely aware that as an African-American man, things won't come easy to his son, telling Tyler, ""we are not afforded the luxury of being average."" However, Ronald is by no means the villain of the piece. He seems to genuinely feel that raising Tyler in this manner is the best thing, telling him, ""I don't push you because I want to, I push you because I have to"". The problem with all of this is that neither Tyler nor Ronald have a backup plan, so when things start to go wrong, Tyler immediately falls apart. And as things get worse and worse, he becomes a pseudo-Job figure, with the big difference being that Job was self-aware and understood his suffering.In terms of problems, there are a few blatantly expositionary scenes. An especially egregious example is the scene where Ronald outlines how hard it is for a black man to get ahead in the US, using that as justification for why he pushes Tyler so hard. Whilst the sentiments are fine, it doesn't ring true that this is the first time Ronald has said this to Tyler. Surely he would have given him this talk in his youth? It's a well-acted scene in isolation, but in the context of the overall script, it's too literal and seems out of place. Additionally, Shults tends to use the stuff of daytime soap to propel the plot - the end of a sports career, the prospect of having a child at such a young age, a family tragedy. The performers make the material work, but the film does come close to melodrama on occasion.Nevertheless, although it's initially bleak, looking at loss and disintegration, Waves ultimately reveals itself to be about the ability of love to conquer despair, about how life can persist no matter the circumstances, about the importance and restorative power of family. Shults uses this framework to build a quite audacious monument that celebrates the ordinary without ever overshadowing it.",Waves
47,TuesdayThe17th,Crash into me,9,10 February 2020,"In 2008, at the beginning of my junior year of high school, I saw an indie film called ""Rollercoaster"" it was an intense and emotional drama about a group of orphan kids and the fateful day they snuck into an abandoned amusement park. I was 16 years old, and that movie changed my life. After watching it I made my way outside where i paced back and forth almost vomiting while trying to come to terms with the film I just watched. My emotions were spinning. There are many good indie films but nothing moved me the way ""Rollercoaster"" did. I can say the same for Trey Edward Shultz's ""Waves"" but in a bigger way. ""Waves"" is a very deeply felt film. Shultz uses filmmaking as a sledgehammer, knocking through the barriers of standard viewing, creating an experience so immersive that it feels like the stakes are high even for US as we watch the film. Like WE have a lot to lose or gain along with the characters. This is something I rarely to never see in a movie. This is not a job for Shultz but a way of life. I can relate so much to Kelvin Harrison Jrs character, Tyler, as I too was in what felt like a super serious relationship in high school that ended badly. Not as badly as his lol but we were both very emotionally hurt. Love hurts when you're young and time passes more slowly. You feel like you will never get out of this moment or that the pain wont subside. Teens make bad decisions out of angst and frustration all the time and it ends up costing them more in return. I made mistakes as will the next kid. Seeing this movie at a young impressionable age could change someones life, as ""Waves"" grabs you by the hand and pulls you into its dreamy and lifelike story. The first 75 minutes of this movie build and build to a maximum tension and devastating climax resulting in a fresh breath feeling second half of grief and recovery. This is where we reel in our hearts as they have fallen out of our chest onto the floor from what we witnessed. The second half is interesting but slightly...idk....boringish. I thought Lucas Hedges was poorly cast and I feel there should have been one more scene in the second half that was more interesting than the sum of the last 60 minutes. I fell in love with this movie and it is a masterpiece but the slight issues with the second half cause this to be a 9 for me and not a 10.. If the second half felt more cohesive with the first and was a bit more interesting I would have given this movie a 10 all day.",Waves

52,LiveLoveLead,Focused more on soundtrack and visuals than the story and characters.,6,3 August 2020,"Very difficult to review. Waves is essentially 2 movies in one. The film is about a suburban, middle-class black family and focuses mainly on the teens. The acting is undeniably great. The story is relevant and deals with how teens navigate in today's society, the pressures, and decisions they face, family dysfunction, poor choices, consequences, first love, forgiveness, and healing. The first half follows the older son Tyler. He's outgoing, popular, athletic, and living the high life until some poor choices start making his picture-perfect life unravel. The second half focuses on his younger sister, shy, introverted, Emily, who is having to deal with the fallout of her brother's choices and basically her coming-of-age story. (I preferred the second half.) The emotions are raw and real. The problem is the way it's filmed. First, the movie is way too long. Second, they try to be so ""artsy"" that it's annoying and pretentious. There are tons of long scenes just driving in cars with music, showing scenery glide by or psychedelic colors, long moments focused on characters just sitting, contemplating, worrying. Other times is chaotic, frenzied, and jumping all over the place. They show close-ups of people throwing up like 4 times, gross! Although the cinematography and music are good, they overly focus on them (the soundtrack is about 30 songs from oldies to rap) If they cut this movie by 40 minutes, taking out or shortening many of the long extended artsy scenes it would be more engaging and focused, and it would add more tension, In My Humble Opinion!

Although there are some beautiful shots for more than an hour it is basically a montage where you will get dizzy because the camera is tilting, panning, spinning zooming non-stop always with the red and blue color scheme while you get bombarded with song after song after song. I just wanted to scream: ""Slow down"". The most precious toy is the 360 degree camera pan which you will get again and again. The idea in a movie is that the camera, sound, costume, set design and so on compliment and underline your story. They should never become the story.
So for more than an hour it was almost unwatchable because of the theatrics basically watching a music video. Then they considerably turn down all of that stuff and you actually get real scenes with real actors, good ones and good acting as well. What a novel concept. If the director would have decided to to the movie that way it could have been great but actors become the second lead overshadowed by theatrics.",Waves
55,cappiethadog,No cure for pain,8,15 December 2019,"""Your father doesn't mean to act that way,"" Lou(Barbara Rush), the consummate fifties-era wife, loyal and self-effacing, explains patiently to Richie(Christopher Olsen), her verbally-abused son, who shouts through tears: ""I hate him!"" While Ed Avery(James Mason) steps outside the boy's bedroom for a moment, the mother sneaks Richie a glass of milk to quickly down, before he resumes the heated math lesson, an exercise in pedagogy as torture. It's the cortisone, Lou explains, a miracle drug that Dr. Norton(Robert Simon) prescribed Ed for his seriously-inflamed arteries, a condition called polyarteritis nodosa, which gives him delusions of grandeur and violent mood swings, side effects brought upon by the user taking more than the advised dosage. ""Bigger Than Life"", directed by Nicholas Ray, adapted from Berton Rouche's ""New Yorker"" article about the dark side of prescription drugs, is an early forerunner to Trey Edward Shults' ""Waves"", which intriguingly presents the pharmaceutical as a danger that's deliberately obtuse; a red herring, for some. Since cortisone puts Ed out of commission, Pat asks her son to be the de facto man of the house. In a role-reversal, no doubt, strange to an average moviegoer in 1956, the boy goes through his father's folded garments, like Ed is some juvenile delinquent, and finds what he was looking for, a bottle of cortisone secreted away behind the top dresser drawer. Richie looks up, just in time to see the enraged man-child fill a small vanity mirror, staring down the child-adult like he was a complete stranger. Cortisone addiction excuses Ed's overture to murder the boy with a knife, just stopping short of entering the room after charging up the stairs. Wally Gibbs(Walter Matthau), Ed's middle-school colleague, intervenes on Richie's behalf after the father regains his bearings. The physical education teacher saves the day, but even if his arrival came too late, the blood on Ed Avery's hands would be forgiven. His wife had already exonerated him of all culpability. Lou lets her husband off the hook. Medical science is to blame. It's those damn pills.He signed up for this. Tyler(Kelvin Harrison Jr.), a high school wrestler, trains with his father, Ronald(Sterling K. Brown), a buff, no-nonsense taskmaster, because he wants to earn an athletic scholarship at a first-tier college with a first-tier athletic program. The father impresses on Tyler that being ordinary isn't enough for a person of color; he must outwork his teammates, mostly white, but it's not as if the family is starving. Ronald Williams and his wife Catherine(Renee Elise Goldsberry) can afford to pay college tuition for both children, including Emily(Taylor Russell), Tyler's younger sister. On some level, Ronald just enjoys being a sadist. Not only does the son train with his father, he also works with Ronald Williams, who is the foreman of a construction company. For all of the father's bombastic talk about being your own man, technically, he would be nothing without Catherine, his boss. She owns the company. Deep-seated feelings of inadequacy could be the cause for Ronald's overcompensation, pushing Tyler so hard, he never discloses to anybody, his serious career-threatening injury, a Level 5 SLAP tear, because failure is not an option, a tenet ingrained so deep by his father that the idea of quitting never crosses the young man's mind. Ronald, an alpha male to start with, the addition of pain-relieving medicine inflates his already overblown ego to proportions that, inevitably, causes problems that nobody can quite get a handle on, during the whole of the film's running time. Tyler has his own prescription. Like father, like son; no pain, no gain, but both men need OxyContin to take the pain away. Unlike Richie, who makes an attempt at confiscating his father's cortisone, seeing how it alters the man's personality, Tyler never sees it, confusing tyranny for machismo, when he steals a few opioids from Ronald's medicine cabinet. Tyler can't tell where man leaves off and man under the influence begins, because he grew up to be just like him, victims, both, of a culture based on toxic masculinity. His father is complicit; he knows it's not Catherine pilfering the OxyContin. The mother misses all the warning signs, regarding her loved ones' aggressive, sometimes antisocial behavior, both husband and son, as being a symptom of boys just being boys. Nothing unusual about arm-wrestling right there, right now, on a crowded table strewn with dishes partially-filled with uneaten food, crumpled napkins, and utensils, in a bustling diner where waitresses and other customers are walking abound; nothing, surely, that would indicate a drug problem. The father wins the match. Tyler looks agonized by the one-sided victory. This pursuit of a competitive edge morphed into living on the edge. Neither son nor father ever stops to consider the toll that wrestling takes on a young body. Ronald is too busy living vicariously through Tyler's achievements. Every medal that goes around his son's neck offsets Ronald's feelings of emasculation caused by being dependent on Catherine. Tyler is not her biological son. He built this wrestling champion on his own. Tyler's success on the wrestling mat makes him feel bigger than life.Lou drives her husband to school. ""Well, here we are again- male schoolmarm,"" Ed jokes, a little sheepishly, as he exits the car. The visual metaphor for Ed's impotence as a breadwinner encapsulates itself in the form of a deflated football, a souvenir from his glory days as a benchwarmer-turned-hero-for-a-day, which Richie helps him pump up with, another metaphor, hot air. In return, Ed pumps his son up, throwing hard spirals in the backyard that the boy can't handle. It's no way for a father to act, but he has the built-in excuse of drug addiction, even when he declares"" ""God was wrong,"" when Lou reminds her husband that Abraham didn't follow through with his intent to murder Issac, the son. Likewise, it's no way for a potential father to act, in ""Waves"", when Tyler stalks Alexis(Alexa Demie), his pregnant ex-girlfriend, at an after-prom party, under the influence of opioids. Alexis had ended her association with Tyler after an ugly row in his truck, following their visit to an abortion clinic, where she underwent misgivings about going through with the procedure to her boyfriend's considerable dismay. Potty-mouthed and misogynistic, the audience hardly recognizes the Tyler we saw at the outset of ""Waves"", during happier times, when Tyler and Alexis drive to the beach, looking very much in love. This display of unprecedented ugliness, the audience gauges, is not completely wrestling-related. It's the Oxycontin. Alas, instead of a reconciliation, Tyler ends up hitting the girl in the side of her head, killing both mother and the unborn baby. Tyler gets his abortion, after all, but with a price to pay that he can't afford. The audience knows therein lies a connection between the painkiller and his actions, but nobody in ""Waves"" does. Nobody onscreen, like Lou, Richie's mother, in ""Bigger Than Life"", tells us how we should feel about Tyler. The viewer decides if blame should be ascribed to the individual or the drug company, or some amalgamation of the two.Emily needs an excuse for Alexis' violent end, more so than anybody. In ""Bigger Than Life"", Ed Avery locks his wife in a closet before he ascends the stairs with an intent to kill their son. Emily, however, is wracked with guilt, because she sat frozen on the couch, instead of intervening on Alexis' behalf by stopping her brother's progress towards the forthcoming murder scene, and perhaps, in doing so, avert a senseless tragedy. She didn't want to cause any waves.Does it matter, though? It's a cold comfort for all parties concerned. It won't bring Alexis back. Tyler has to serve thirty years, regardless, pills' fault or not, before he is eligible for parole. ""Waves"" is set in a time before anybody knew about the danger that opioids presented.Only the pharmaceutical industry knew.",Waves
56,IamROCKAS,A solid sob-story with a darker undertone,6,21 January 2021,"From the first few minutes, I expected this movie to be just another coming-of-age move where I would envy the perfect couple story and a good relationship with the protagonist's parents but instead, I ended up with one of the biggest sob stories in my recent memory. Guess things in life aren't always as they seem, there's more than one given angle to any one given scene. I had to stop a few times throughout the run of this movie as it actually hit me emotionally, which is a trait of a good movie and I admit, some tears were shed throughout the 135-minute runtime. Including song like ""True Love Waits"" by Radiohead and ""Sound & Color"" by Alabama shakes only made me tear up, as they're a part of the assortment of song that are the most emotional in my musical collection. Speaking of music, this movie had a truly magnificent soundtrack, I felt the emotion that was displayed with each song and it matched the mood of the situation that the people were experiencing at those moments. Although it had a lot of powerful and emotional scenes, I can't really look at it as anything more than just a huge sob story in the end. I need those to get a bit grounded from time to time but it's just not something I tend to watch for own pleasure on a regular basis. Besides the incredible narration that the movie displays, I didn't see anything unique or ground-breaking, other than a solid, heart-breaking sob-story.",Waves
57,ccamp89,Strong 4 // One of the most exciting young American directors,8,23 December 2019,"Trey Edward Shults solidifies himself as one of the most exciting young American directors working today. Like Krisha and It Comes at Night before it, Waves is another deep dive into family psychology, though with a far grander scope and an operatic tone reminiscent of the work of Terrance Mallick. The pure energy and style of the filmmaking here, particularly in the first half, is truly something to behold. The camera whips and whirls, the music surges, the emotions sear, and scenes transition between one another in a fluid stream of consciousness. Then things settle down as the movie unexpectedly switches gears. It's an interesting structural choice that makes for a unique flow to the film and certainly helps put you in the emotional headspace of the characters, though the slowness of the last third compared to the first and its relative lack of narrative thrust can become a bit patience-testing. Ambition is one of the film's greatest strengths but also winds up being one of its weaknesses. If there's one thing that holds it back, it's that the execution just doesn't quite match that ambition in the film's final act. It just barely misses the mark on the emotional resolution it really needed to tie things up after its long, emotional journey. Still, when this film is at its best, it offers up some of the most powerful images and drama of the year. Shults has a masterpiece in him somewhere, and I can't wait to see him realize it.Strong 4/5",Waves

60,safsurfer,"Slow meandering journey of a families love, hardship, and reconciliation",8,21 January 2020,"I'll start by saying that slow doesn't mean boring as this film was anything but. The script was well written and structured to give you everything you needed to ride along and feel the highs and lows of life these characters were dealing with from start to finish. The dialog was very engaging and realistic to what real life teens and parents deal with every day....especially now in the digital age.The main story of this film is every parents nightmare and nobody can accurately say this can never happen to them....it happens, so be prepared. Few families are epuipped to handle the tragedy that takes place here no matter which side of it you're on. Like a wrecking ball that destroys everything in its path equally affecting everyone connected to the heart of the centerline.....the dead are mourned, guilty are convicted, and both sides of families and friends are left in the aftermath to deal with the uncertainty of life.This film conveyes powerful messages of love, family bonds, coming of age teens, the pressure of succeeding, failing, or just being average, the pressure of parental guidance vs control, grieving tragedy and how to cope and move forward, dealing with personal guilt, dealing with loss of a child, remorse, shame, and how to reconcile the loss of life, rebuilding family bonds after picking up the broken pieces, and much more and does it in a very subtle moving way that really hits hard on every chord of being.This is a good movie and should be seen by everyone with children and by teen children of age to watch this movie and by anyone else who interacts with both.

I think Waves is a metaphor for relationships, at least that is how I perceived it. Temporal, transient formations, peaks and troughs. They break, change directions, but never completely cease, like the cycle of life. Generations of people falling in and out of love, even rekindling old ones.
There are other interwoven themes such as child birth rights, peer pressure, social injustice, battling depression, and compassion, which all lead to a though provoking movie.
There are no good and bad people in this movie, only fallible ones.",Waves

The cinematography is beautiful, the anticipation was nail biting, and the plot was big and bold! For the first 90 minutes or so the film was building to a fever pitch. I got notes of the Safdie Brothers with booming sound design that really put the viewer on the edge of their seat with anxiety! But the film is called Waves, after all, and the plot then explored a number of other subplots, characters, and perspectives. I think the film ultimately tries to do more than it possibly can with so many ideas and characters, but there is a lot to enjoy here!",Waves
63,logicproreviews,The most aptly titled film of 2019!,7,17 September 2020,"This is proper drama 101 - essentially, a character drama about family and romantic relationships, juggling the difficult decisions people have to make in life. Aptly title 'Waves' a good metaphor for the up and down motion on constant play here.Waves has two narratives. The first half concerns Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) as he deals with his inner pain, despair and penchant for violence. The second story follows Tyler's sister Emily (Taylor Russell) in her journey of love and beauty.This is a deep film, rich with interesting characters. If the first half is a derailed train heading straight for a solid brick wall, the second half is a meadow filled with lush greens and daisy chains.Highly watchable7/10",Waves
64,melodyso,Stunning cinematography powerful emotion,9,2 January 2021,"It gave me the euphoria vibe, probably with the neon color in dark background. But it is aesthetic in a different way as well. With the spinning camera movement and vibrant/earth tone color. It's a feast to the eyes. The black screen is also used so appropriately to show suspense.The story takes very unexpected turns. I'm pleasantly surprised that it is kinda split to document two characters development. I really like that! I like how the characters are very three dimensional and you can see them evolve throughout the movie. The emotions are very powerful and real. The characters did such an amazing job articulate them.What I would love to see more is the characters backstory and why they are the way they are. The collages didn't really explain that much about why things are. If there's more build up/explanations, I'll relate to it more.",Waves
65,michaeldoud,"First Hit: I'm not always a fan of revolving cameras and frame sizing to create a feeling, but this time it worked.",9,4 December 2019,"First Hit: I'm not always a fan of revolving cameras and frame sizing to create a feeling, but this time it worked.In an opening scene, Alexis (Alexa Demie) and Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) are driving in a car. They are young, the music is blaring, and they are drunk on their love for each other and being young and alive. The camera keeps going in circles creating a feeling of erratic motion, and that something is going to happen. I kept holding on to my armrest thinking that an accident was coming soon. It didn't.This opening scene gave me a sense that the film was going to be a roller coaster of feelings because of all the joy in this scene and the spirit of impending doom riding in the background.Tyler lives with his father, Ronald (Sterling K. Brown), his stepmother Catharine (Renee Elise Goldsberry), and sister Emily (Taylor Russell). They are clearly middle class, and as a black man Ronald is very proud of his work ethic, what he's achieved, and makes a point of instilling his driven work ethic in his children.Tyler is on the wrestling team in high school. Ronald is very engaged with his son's wrestling. He works out with Tyler and practices wrestling moves in their garage. He pushes him to be the best wrestler on the team. They not only practice wrestling moves in their garage; they also lift weights together, and they challenge each other while working out and wrestling. In one telling scene, after Tyler pins his opponent for a win, afterward his father tells him if he would have made different moves, he would have pinned his opponent 20 seconds sooner.So it wasn't only about the win, but how fast and what moves Tyler performed in each match that was challenged by Ronald. What Ronald doesn't know is that Tyler is hiding a shoulder injury from everyone, and the doctor is quite clear that the injury is so severe that he'll have permanent damage if he continues to wrestle.Tyler likes to party with his friends and is very popular at school. He and his girlfriend Alexis spend a lot of time together and are sexually active. During one text message exchange, she tells him her period's late.As the film proceeds, the pressure is building up in Tyler; his father is riding him to be better, his shoulder and ticket to college are irreparably damaged, and his girlfriend is pregnant. His drinking is getting worse, he's smoking more pot, and taking lots of pain pills; his life is spinning out of control.Going with Alexis to the abortion clinic, she changes her mind and says she wants to keep the baby. Tyler goes ballistic, they get in a massive fight in the car, and she breaks up with him.The tension in the film is enhanced by the use of different camera movements, image focus slipping, and color splashes only add to what is about to happen.Violence breaks out, and Tyler finds a reason to express the rage within and without thinking hurts the people he loves and who love him. It ends up in an act to which he finds himself arrested and sentenced to jail.Shortly after that, Tyler's sister Emily, who has been nearly a forgotten person in the family, meets Luke (Lucas Hedges). The early scenes of their meeting and getting to know each other are magnificently done. They felt real and authentic to the characters. Both are damaged in different ways. Luke because his father's alcoholic rages and when his father left him and his mother. Emily, because she's the forgotten one in the family and is now embarrassed because she's the sister of her once-popular imprisoned brother.When the film moves into this new story, the relationship between Luke and Emily, I started wondering where it was headed. Then I started worrying about Emily because she began to party and experiment with pot in the same way her brother did. I thought more trouble was brewing.However, the story unfolds towards the power of forgiveness and speaking openly and truthfully. As Emily supported Luke in his healing, she was being healed.I am not a fan of camera movement, becoming a significant part of the story, but for some reason it worked. I could have used less of the swirling circular motions, but it did add to the sensation the film was attempting to make.Also, as I reviewed a different film recently, I'm not a big fan of changing the image size on the screen as a way to affect the viewer. But again, here it worked. At times it was letterbox style, other times almost portrait, like what one sees from a phone video, and at other times it was full screen.This is a story about a family on a journey through love, tough times, tragedy, and forgiveness. It worked.Harrison Jr. was compelling as the young man attempting to live up to his father's ideals, failing, and spiraling out of control. The angst leading to his lashing out is probably familiar to many a young man. Russell was sublime as Harrison's younger sister, who had to come out of the shadows to be seen and own her own life. Demie was wonderful as Harrison's girlfriend, who didn't want to be controlled and wanted her feelings to be heard and honored. Brown as Harrison's dad was terrific. His portrayal of a man who was blinded by his own work and not seeing the effect it was having on his wife and kids was convincing. Goldsberry was terrific as the stepmother who empathized with the kids and struggled to find her place when her husband refused to be empathic to her pain. Hedges was excellent as Russell's boyfriend, who reached out in her time of need, and in turn she gave him strength to deal with his past. Trey Edward Shults wrote a strong and powerful script which he then in-turn directed. As a director he knew what he wanted, and I, for one, liked what he did.Overall: This film captured the power of love and forgiveness over the expression of anger.",Waves
66,popcolin,2 movies for 1,5,17 February 2020,"Even the synopsis is a spoiler and I would have rather known that this movie is split evenly down the middle into 2 separate halves that really don't have anything to do with eachother. I was really looking forward to this movie because of the director's first film. His second film had none of the raw emotions that the first one had. The first one was effortless because it felt as though the director really had something to say. This movie on the other hand seems to have no point. Is it about family drama, stress, redemption? I really have no idea. Seems to be like a really fancy film project where the director can flex his muscles by writing all these camera movements and music cues basically into the script as though the movie itself is a character. And for how unstructured the story is the director seemed to have no problem evenly splitting this movie into two completely unstructured segments that are exactly the same length, which leaves me feeling misled because everyone knows that this is not the way to make movies. Its frusturating because the movie certainly never gets you to care about either of its leading actors and doesn't really give you the chance to because neither storyline develops far enough because each one is limited to an hour. I kind of wonder if the original intention was to have both storylines intercut and peppered more evenly through the movie. Although that wouldn't make sense either. In its journey to startle and shock the audience the film forgets in order to shock us you have to develop a story, and this one is almost non-existent. Anyway, I'm not sure whether this is a sports movie, a teen angst kinda-thing, a romance movie, or like a gritty slice-of-life. Either way it fails to make any kind of statement about young people or the state of the country and certainly fails at making a worthwhile family drama because everyone is a one dimensional character. Either that or it is just boring.",Waves
67,richard-1967,"Tense, extremely ambitious, not always successful, but a must-see",8,6 November 2019,"31-year-old director Trey Edward Shults didn't decide to go modest with his third feature. Waves is a big, broad movie, about many relationships, many deep feelings, many social issues. It doesn't always succeed, but boy, it was worth the effort!Shults focuses on an upscale African-American family in an affluent suburb in Florida. The son's a HS wrestling star, the daughter is quiet and sweet, the dad's successful but tough on his kids because he knows the cost of success particularly for a black family, and the mom, who's in medicine, is an empathic parent. But this seemingly idyllic set-up is shattered in the first minute by the jumping camera and raucous music. The tension is palpable. Something is going to happen throughout this film, but we don't quite know what. (Fear of the unknown was a hallmark of Shults's other notable film, It Comes at Night.)So this movie is not for the faint-hearted, but it's got a lot to say. About fathers and sons, parents and children, young love, sharing (or not sharing) secrets, hate, anger, and forgiveness, and the effects that great pain - physical and psychic - have on the soul. Needless to say, with this ambitious an agenda, some things work better than others. Some silly plot errors bugged me, but maybe it just doesn't matter much. Another issue that's been raised: a white director working with a black-centric story; didn't bother me, but it's been talked about. Still, the film is never boring, never static, and never mails it in. Even if 75% of the plot and message works, that was good enough for me. It is NOT easy to watch, but it has a lot to say.Fasten your seatbelts!",Waves

69,thetyvonlesure,"A Stylized, Beautiful Heartbreaker",10,16 December 2019,"Waves is a drama centered around the lives of an upper-middle class family in Florida. Waves is directed by Trey Edward Shultz, and it stars Kelvin Harrison Jr., Taylor Russell, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Sterling K. Brown as the Williams family. Throughout the film, the family faces internal and external conflict that pushes the boundaries of their love. The story of the film is broken into two distinct character arcs. One arc leads into the other, and the film treats the atypical dramatic structure as a loop, as opposed to a singular line. The use of looping, presents the story without a true ending, but rather a new beginning. The storyline of this film is wonderfully heartbreaking. The writing hurts in a good way.The brightest qualities of this film come from the editing, cinematography, and the soundtrack. The editing is incredible. The film transitions smoothly, while taking its time to enjoy the scenery. The use of color and visual effects within the film is masterfully edited in with the ongoing story. The scenes are edited to perfectly match the soundtrack put together by Trent Reznor. The soundtrack is a beautiful representation of teenage hormones and emotion. Each song accurately reflects the emotion and energy that Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr's character) and Emily (Taylor Russell's character) are presenting. The soundtrack is an all star ensemble of contemporary Hip Hop and R&B. Sonically, it adds a lot of depth to the film and the characters. The audio engineering, is some of 2019's best work.The cinematography is beautiful. Drew Daniels does a phenomenal job capturing the beauty of South Florida. The film is well lit and colorized, displaying a keen sense of hyperactivity. Daniels successfully captures the emotion and energy of each character. When the film is at a low, the cinematography reflects the low point. When the film is at a high, the cinematography reflects the high point. The story's pace and emotion is flawlessly matched by the cinematography. A lot of the shots within the film are stylized and well done. An excellent example of Daniels' fantastic work comes from the 360 shot seen within cars throughout the film. Daniels' cinematography is a shining example of great camera and lighting use.The acting within the film is beautiful. There are no hiccups within the cast. Every member of the cast emits raw emotion that moviegoers will feel. Their energy guides the film to grace. The audience feels for each character and shares their success and anguish. Kelvin Harrison Jr. is the breakout actor of the film. His portrayal of Tyler is an amazing performance. Each character is presented differently and portrayed in a unique fashion. The Williams family feel like real people living within a reality of heartbreak.Overall, Waves hurts. It hurts because it feels so real. Waves deals with the duality of life and death, and the duality of love and hate. Waves is a beautiful film with a powerful and wondrous presentation that shines cinematically and sonically.",Waves

I appreciate the overall theme of the movie and in the end I was teary eyed. But overall I wouldn't watch it again. I also don't think it's a ""must watch"".

73,kaneeddy,A fantastic amalgamation of genres,10,11 July 2020,"Trey Edward Shults shows us that he is one of the most promising directors working today by showcasing some masterful work in Waves. His direction is fantastic from the way that he uses the cinematography to immerse you by using many close ups and orbiting shots, this cinematography, the excellent writing and the strong performances from everyone in the film giving a great ensemble performance get us to instantly connect with these characters this is especially seen from Kelvin Harrison Jr, Taylor Russell and Sterling K Brown who are all mesmerising in this film, they feel real, they act in many ways that everyone does making the audience see themselves to some standard in each character. The way the story is told is so interesting and refreshing, with the first half having a Safdie brothers feel to it with how stressful it feels, climaxing in emotional devastation, and the second half being a road to redemption and togetherness, also the soundtrack used throughout the duration of the film is excellent and enhances these scenes so much.The only critique I can see is that the beginning of the second half of the film is a little slow and i think that was used to help us gather ourselves after the highly emotional scenes that precede it however, it does pick up again and further immerses us again.Overall, Waves joins a massive list of fantastic films that have come from A24, this film is emotionally devastating and will leave you speechless after the credits are finished, the performances are fantastic and Trey Edward Shults provides us with some of the best scenes put to screen. this is a must watch as I feel this can impact a lot of people and shock you the way it did with me.",Waves

This two elements shape the whole movie with the help of music, directing and editing. I would like to underline how compact this movie feels, It seems like every little thing is going for a single collective goal.The movie reminds me how universal and timeless can be everything that will happen to every single one of us, even If those actions won't change a thing for the rest.Really worth checking It out, do not miss It, one of the best american indie films of the year.",Waves
76,Lepidopterous_,Rediscovering family & love among the oscillatory demands of life,9,8 November 2019,"*minor vague spoilers on structure & theme*Waves is an ambitious, impassioned, and honest depiction of the trials and tribulations that reverberate through our lives. It is slice of life cinema that brings us so urgently into human moments at an intimacy I haven't seen since Honeyland or Roma. It's about the weight of our personal battles, but also about rediscovering family, love, and some sense of normalcy in a world that can grow tumultuous and overbearing.Waves, however, is primarily a sensory experience. The meticulous, immersive film & sound editing is notably well done, with visuals & colors that reflect character & mood, thoughtfully crafted transitions, and a jarring shift in tone and theme (writer/director Trey Edward Schultz apparently does all the editing himself!). There is essentially an anxiety-filled Krisha-like chapter accompanied by a fantastic score from Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails, followed by a lighter, more weightless Terrence Malick chapter. The camera communicates theme and emotion through all of this extraordinarily well.Wonderful casting & chemistry. It's sincerely difficult to pick a favorite character when each one is written and acted so well. A few minor issues with the first half, including the medical probability of a particular event and the dynamic style being a bit heavy-handed initially. The second half emotionally wrecked the audience, as tears and sobs filled the Opera House throughout this portion. At times I thought of Lee Chang-dong's masterful meditation on grief, Secret Sunshine in the way the film spends time in silence, self-discovery, and learning to love again.The opening shot of the film begins with the sound of heavy breathing in and out. Amidst all the chaos in life, it never again feels we can reduce life back down to these peaceful respiratory oscillations that keep us alive and moving forward.DFF42 Red Carpet Presentation",Waves

78,dolive-578-564987,A different kind of black movie,9,28 January 2020,"Young people and their parents work through inevitable and commonplace family challenges. The ""kids"" prove to be remarkably strong. A story of reconciliation, doing the right thing, sorting through confused emotions without much life experience yet coming to smart conclusions. Technically wonderful, a great cast, magnificent SoBe setting used to maximum effect, and smooth inter-cutting to tell parallel stories with seamless transitions. A different kind of black movie? Yes, no racial injustice, which still has its crucial place in storytelling (Fruitvale Station, Harriet). But a non-racialized black film, probably why the Oscars overlooked or snubbed it, with few equals in explaining how families and individuals with tough decisions to make handle those challenges. This is the stuff of life, difficult to dramatize and all the more need for that, and done superbly here. Once again, an indie shows the way.

80,ian-dodkins,"Original, artistic but not artsy",8,25 January 2020,"I love a good story, and to be honest this film has quite a simple, albeit interesting and emotional story. But this film isn't about just a simple sad story, it's about the emotional connection between the characters. The cinematography is astounding.. great colour, close ups and longish periods of seeing an extended reaction. Might sound completely dire, but actually the actors were up to the challenge and create unique and engaging characters who you genuinely feel for. And isn't a simple good/bad film or people. You can see flaws and loveable traits in them all. The way the director characterises adolescent love is intense, genuine and beautiful. It really is a work of art, not because it's strange (it isn't) but because it manages to capture emotions in such a realistic way that delve into your own heart, in a way that you couldn't even do yourself. I have not seen a film that was able to do what this film did. Despite not having a particularly engaging story, I was indulging in every second of this film, mesmorised.So why just an 8? I'm not really sure. It deserves a 9, but part of me thinks there should be a more complex story behind it, even though it's not really necessary. In some ways it reminded me of Moonlight, but the atmosphere and subject very different.I recommend to anyone that is able to cry at a movie (male or female), but the Marvel superhero film lovers and children/adolescents probably won't engage with it.

Stylistically and thematically the most obvious comparison is HBO's criminally underrated teen drama series Euphoria. The emotive, minimal score by Atticus Finch and Trent Reznor ebbs and flows creating tension and release, while the stellar soundtrack mirrors themes of love, anger, loss and redemption.

98,JRodFilms,Waves (2019),7,12 December 2019,"Waves, from A24, who right now is probably the leader in independent cinema in America. I pretty much went into this movie blind, only saw the trailer once and that was enough to get me to see it.The film begins with Tyler and his girlfriend enjoying their youth in South Florida. He lives with his family in an upscale house with an overbearing father who pushes him and plugs into him that he has to work 10 times harder than everyone else and does not have the luxury to settle for mediocre.Tyler's girlfriend reveals to him that she is pregnant. Unfortunately the scene came off to me as cliché and something you have seen thousands of times as Lifetime, but luckily, the film begins to shift after that scene and Tyler's life begins to collapse around him.He and his girlfriend decide to get an abortion but are met by protesters, his girlfriend has a change of heart and does not go through with the abortion. As they leave the clinic a woman shouts a racial slur at Tyler, and fights with his girlfriend in the car and kicks her out of the car.Tyler begins to spiral out of control as he starts to steal Oxycodone pills from his father. His father suspects his son but never confronts him. Tylers performance as a wrestler begins the decline, and it is affecting his mood. Once Tylers girlfriend decides to keep the baby, he goes ballistic and she breaks up with him.He loses all hope and stalks her through social media on Prom Night, drives to the party she is at, gets into a fight with her and he hits her and she cracks her head on the garage floor and dies.Tyler is sentenced to life in prison and then the film shifts to focus on his sister, who is pretty much in the background during the first half of the film. After her brothers trial and sentencing, she begins to isolate herself at school, but Lucas Hedges comes up to her and introduces himself, and they start a relationship which is portrayed more mature than a couple of high school kids could handle.There are scenes of them taking showers and baths together, and end up driving to Missouri to see Lucas Hedges dying father. I found their relationship to be somewhat far fetched and unbelievable.The story may have a typical after school special narrative, but it is the performances and the pulsating soundtrack that carry the film. Songs from Tame Impala, Animal Collective, Tyler the Creator, Kid Cudi The Glenn Miller Orchestra and a host of others surround the film and will definitely keep you awake.The opening of the film gave me a lot of memories of past teen films from my time like Varsity Blues, She's All That, even Dazed and Confused and having the film set in South Florida location reminded me of the Larry Clark film Bully which is a true story captures the twisted minds in cookie cutter suburbia. Waves isnt twisted like Bully, but it is another tale of the high school experience that is really lacking in cinema today.",Waves
99,tune345,Holy cow that cinematography!!,9,23 July 2020,The way its shot got me hyped enough to write this. The colors that are used in this I haven't seen in any film and I have seen alot of films.

100,filipovnanastassja,Watch it for the emotion,9,8 July 2020,"Someone wrote this movie ripped their heart out - I agree wholeheartedly. If you plan on seeing this movie, don't be concerned by the narrative or plot: neither is there for the sake of it, but to explore human emotions such as grief, love, hate, forgiveness. It's true there are two movies here: one very erratic, almost to the point of nausea: you just know something heartbreaking is going to happen: for the girl to die, I certainly did not. So we are about an hour in when our protagonist ends up in jail for pretty much the rest of his life. Normally, I asked myself: where is this movie going??
Suddenly focalisation changes and little sister is now the main protagonist. The second part is like putting an ointment on a fresh wound. It's all about healing and not shutting yourself out: trying to forget and forgive even when you hate somebody, or, more precisely, somebody's actions. How can we forgive when we hate the demon inside them?",Waves

102,JasonGuzman,Unsettling depiction of a black middle class family in suburban Florida,9,26 January 2020,"There is an uneasy foreboding in the first half of this film as we follow the male teenage member of this family as he lives a pretty typical teenage life. His father whips him up into shape for the wrestling team, instilling in him a strong work ethic. We get an intimate look at him and his girlfriends relationship but we also get the sense that something tragic is going to happen and when it does we are swept up in the whirlwind of the dizzying camera movements and the teal/pink color palette. Trey Shults first film 'Krisha' had the same 'uncomfortable-but-cant stop-watching' feeling. The second half becomes more mellow and it deals with the aftermath of an inadvertent tragedy mainly through the daughter of the family who is coming to terms with it as she is becoming mature. She meets a young man (Lucas Hedges) who offers a sense of calm amidst the emotional storm and when he finds out his cancer-stricken Dad is about to die on his deathbed, she convinces him to visit him and it becomes a healing journey for everyone. Tragic and beautiful. Why was this movie overlooked by the Oscars is beyond me. The acting was great across the board but Taylor Russell is a standout.",Waves
103,sean3240,Looks amazing,8,1 February 2021,"The cinematography, colours and ever-changing aspect ratio fit together perfectly to put across the perfect visual to match the tone of each scene.I went in blind so there were a few effective surprises with regards to the films events and even the structure which definitely added to my engagement and interest in this story.Other than a bit of shaky writing here and there I don't think anything was executed badly. There were however a few occasions when I had to question the relevance of scenes to the overall journey of the film. This can unfortunately make the film feel like it's slowing down at times.When it first happened I got a little nervous that the changing aspect ratio would come across cheesy and hipstery, but it actually turned out to be really effective and it always fit in with what the scene needed.I wasn't expecting the second half of the movie to switch it's lead character to be Tyler's sister Emily, but it made total sense when it happened. It's a risky thing to do as you definitely risk the audience losing interest (Playing as Abby in 'The Last of Us part II' comes to mind for how this could've been done badly). All those worries aside though, the film managed to keep me engaged through this thematically seamless transition.",Waves

Very little dialog, F this and F that, not even necessary. The movie was boring. I didn't even finish, I just skipped around to the end. Too much music, too many 360 camera scenes; nauseating.

That ""slice of life"" grounds you in the characters. You care about them.A compelling aspect for me was that the point of view seamlessly transitions from the brother to the sister and along the way makes stops with the father and step-mother, the girlfriend and boyfriend. Eventually, the title becomes clear. Every action sends waves that roll over others. It's very thought-provoking and, as I said in the title, it stays with you.On a side note, I wish young people could see this film.

108,carrythe2,"Intense, immersive and deep",7,13 October 2019,"Waves is one hell of a story, an emotionally draining tale about the crushing pressures on some teenagers and the fallout that can result from poor communication and lack of understanding between parents and their children.It is also a wild sensory experience, particularly in the masterful use of music to encapsulate the characters' emotional state, in a way that will be familiar to anyone who was a music-lover in their teens - that heady, swirling intensity of sound that seems to speak only to you. At times it feels as though the soundtrack is ahead of the story, driving it forward.Waves is deliberately a film in 2 halves, and if you're like me you'll be wondering where the hell it's going towards the end. Whilst the intensity builds relentlessly in the first half, the second is gentle and meandering. It's understandable why the story takes that direction (and it's a bold break with conventional storytelling) but, unfortunately, it makes watching to the end a bit of an endurance test - it just completely loses momentum.However, I'd still highly recommend it. It is a confident and complex film exploring extremely relevant and important issues about modern family life. It is a deep exploration of the teenage (and particularly black American) experience.",Waves
109,rossmcdee1,Boring film by boring people for boring people,3,25 January 2020,"Beautiful cinematography can not disguise the lack of content in this film- we've seen this all before, done better; with characters we could care about.
All the characters in this film are either smug, boring or psychotic (latent & manifest).I was expecting stunning visuals from reading various reviews- a visual trip - instead there's a bombardment of garish neon & strobes - those reviewers must have been glue sniffing.There's an overwhelming amount of films being made that have no really likable or emphatic characters- maybe this is due to the overwhelming amounts of cocaine that the film industry absorbs.. the scripts are written & filmed by (effectively) coke-slaves & their perspective on the rest of the world is in many ways snowblind ? ...
It is hard imagine anyone beyond the production of this film being able to stomach the rancid misery of this story of the cardboard characters inhabiting it.
All the technical aspects of the film or good & the actors played their roles well, sadly their talents were wasted on a naff 'vision' of the producers & director. Maybe they should read some good STORIES before making another film?",Waves

The film is a great emotional journey narrated with a great job of directing, camera, lighting and acting that leads you to want to know more about the characters. The soundtrack also accompanies the emotions of the protagonists. I think that personally, to overcome terrible pain and destroy hatred, is to cling to love, hope and redemption and how to transmit it. And like the sea itself, it is never still ...

112,heatherbryan-72686,Just finished and I'm still waiting for it to get better,4,14 July 2020,Boring and pointless. The first 30 mins had a good build up but then the movie crashed and died.

114,prasadgollakota,A great example of how to show a story,9,7 March 2020,"This film is a unique example of how to show a story, versus simply telling a story. I left with a reaction of having been punched in the stomach, and feeling a little winded.Often times a film has a great build up, which is let down by the writers and directors simply not knowing how to end it. This could so easily have gone that way, and at one point thought it might! However, the gentle character arc in the second half is spot on, and I couldnt think of a better way for the movie to have closed out. It was absolutely fantastic. The movie shakes you furiously in the first half, only to give you a gentle warm hug in the second and it uses its cast and characters so precisely and delicately to do so. The cast is on point, and play their roles effortlessly.Moreover, the themes covered by the film apply to so many of us. It addresses those faced by any middle class families across the world; namely, societal and family pressures and competition, and a breakdown due to unmet needs and expectations. Plenty of examples of movies covering this theme (eg. American Beauty, Revolutionary Road etc), however the way this film does it is truly one of a kind and worth a watch. There is one particular scene between father and daughter that stands out for me, and is one of the finest scenes from a cinema I've seen in a long time.",Waves
115,dyonisus,Exactly what todays cinema lacks,9,29 March 2020,"Wave's story isn't one of a typical film or book. It merely treats the audience as a bystander who just happens to watch a family deal with what's thrown at them, mainly from the perspective of a young, ambitious teenager, Ty, and his sweet, shy sister Emily.The film doesn't have a traditional narrative which makes it refreshing while never being boring. Trey Edward Shults could have ended the film after the first act but decides not to and continues to not only tell the amazing dramatic downward spiral of Ty but also the aftermath. Shults tackles other tough topics and introduces more interesting characters as the movie progresses keeping it fresh, while maintaining the observational feeling for the audience.The cinematic execution is also spot on and on par with some of the greatest movies. Shults uses various cinematic effects to tell the story, most notable the amazing use of aspect ratio which reflects Ty feeling more and more claustrophobic and stressed and Emily redifining herself and how she deals with the situation as well as the family growing back together.The whole movie is beautiful to look at with some very cinematic shots, pretty colours and amazing actors. The music is also great, especially if you're a hip-hop and r&b fan.Overall the movie can be slow at some points, but that's just part of it. The movie left me a little confused but totally amazed and it hasn't left me alone even weeks after seeing it. Shults pulls off an amazing work of art which is a love letter to american youth culture and cinema and is exactly what the action and superhero fueled movie industry lacks. Lay back and enjoy.",Waves

But after 30 mins it just goes downhill fast (2/10) The second part of the film is not worth watching (0/10)It isn't emotional, as you never form any connection with the characters.

IMO the best performance and also worthy of an Oscar nomination is from Taylor Russell. Don't miss it!,Waves
121,GabeDoesReviews,Mellow,10,21 January 2020,"I could end this whole review by calling the entire movie great, but its way more than just that. Waves is heartbreaking, mesmerizing, and downright brutal at some moments. What Trey Edward Shults put in this film came from the deepest parts of his mind that no other modern director would be willing to put in at all. It may seem to be an average coming of age story but one that is further enhanced by Shults' direction, alongside its use of music and cinematography. The movie follows the two young protagonists, Tyler and Emily, growing up in South Florida and living with the choices they make in life. It's very cliché at first (trust me, it is) but it fully commits to this idea of love and hatred fueling all the choices our characters make. Just when everything seems calm, another huge hurdle gets in the way, making it feel as if hope is unobtainable. It happens so often that I kept thinking that this whole family would fall apart by the end of the movie. Its easily one of the best movies to handle family drama at this caliber, especially when it feels it hit the point of no return. Every member of the Williams family felt genuine, I even thought this was an actual family given their chemistry with each other felt relatable. The music is a combination of a score performed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross mixed with contemporary songs from artists such as Frank Ocean, Animal Collective, and even Kanye West. Usually I hate it when a movie tries to fit in modern music with its story, but Waves accomplishes it by having the music lead the scene rather than inserting it for marketing. The cinematography ranges from great to dream like that it seems almost impossible on how certain scenes were shot. I want to keep this review as vague as possible just due to it being such a powerhouse of a film, that talking about any detail in the slightest might ruin the experience. Just be prepared to witness something truly different.",Waves
122,BrentKayd,I'm Just Left In Awe,10,7 December 2019,"I just saw Waves and it was one of the most exciting movies I've seen this year. A lot of haters will say it is very dark, emotional and melodramatic, but I enjoyed every second of it. Any ""teen movie fan"", definitely has to check this out. When I hear about movies being good and they actually live up to the hype, I honestly can't think of a better time to be alive. It opens up in a full aspect ratio and as the tension of the film starts to build the film turns to a super wide ratio. I have seen this changing ratio trick done effectively in other movies such as Unsane (2018). I love cinematography of this film, it has mostly a cool color temperature with deep blacks, super punchy colors and under exposed faces in outdoor environments that really turns our attention to the beauty of the sky and surrounding areas. The overall story and its characters had me intrigued from start to finish and I'm really thankful!",Waves
123,shalomsk,All we have is now,9,27 August 2021,"There's always something interesting happening in Waves. Be it visually or in the way the story unfolds, there's no doubt that this a film made with great care and thought. It's scenes are peppered with what seems like carefully chosen songs featuring an eclectic mix of artists that help set the mood and tone of the film and ensure our immersion in its world, with one of my personal favorites, Radiohead's True Love Waits finding a perfect locus in the proceedings. There's an Instagram filter-like quality to the cinematography and colors, which isn't distracting but actually quite fitting considering it's a story about Gen-Z youth. I must say I had no idea what this film was about, but after the first fifteen minutes or so, I thought I had a clue in to how things were going to play out. It starts out by following Tyler, a high school senior who is also a wrestler, the jock character with a domineering parent that we can't say we haven't seen before. This character also features in other popular Gen-Z teen depictions such as Sex Education and Euphoria (both of which I saw before this). We see his routines, get a sense of his relationship dynamics with his family (especially his father) and also get to witness the challenges that he faces being a Black youth. Kelvin Harrison Jr. Deftly calibrates his performance to bring out intensity, but also an innate likeability. There's an empathy with which he plays his character (props must be given to the writing too) that then helps us empathize with him when he behaves questionably and commits some serious blunders. There's a line that the character's father has in the second half of the film (that he delivers to the daughter) that just wouldn't work if he had made missteps in his performance. Midway through the film, a tragedy occurs, and this is when the film changes into something else...something profound and deeply affecting. That's not to say it becomes a depressing film. Sad things happen and characters do linger in a state of grief for a while, but the tone never turns bleak. The colors and some really well crafted characters help a great deal. The focus also shifts towards Emily (Tyler's sister) and she is by far the best character in the film and that is largely in part to the way she's played by Taylor Russell, who is nothing short of a revelation. If the first half of the film played out a bit like Euphoria with better characters, this part of the film plays out The Spectacular Now - another teen drama I really admired. There's an inherent sweetness in the way she and Lucas Hedges portray their characters. I wanted to befriend them. It also made me realize that it had been a while since I had seen such absolute sweethearts on screen. Their relationship, the way the meet, they way they look at each other, the way they comfort each other, the way they care for each other, and even the way they make love to each other is the definition of - and I hate to use the word - ""wholesome"". Not in a cheesy way, but in a deep, human way. The most charitable act a writer can perform for his characters is to write them in a way that makes it hard for us to judge them. All I could do through Waves was to see these characters, feel the love they have in them despite their actions, and truly understand them.",Waves

147,ncrd,How does this have a 7.1?!?!?!?,10,11 September 2019,"Just saw this movie at TIFF.... wow what a film. Incredibly unique, this is the next Moonlight without being anything like Moonlight at all. The whole cast is amazing and Trey Edward Shults puts it all together perfectly. Incredible score to boot. See you at the Oscars Waves.",Waves
148,ncrd,Movie of the year,10,12 September 2019,"Just saw this movie at TIFF, it lives up to the hype and then some. Trey Edward Shults is the next Chazelle/Jenkins. It hit me on a deeper emotional level than any movie I have seen before. SEE WAVES!",Waves
149,megsippey,Very real story but cinematography tricks were too much,8,10 December 2019,The story was very beautifully laid out and real; and it definitely brought tears but the cinematography was a bit much at times for dramatic effect I think. I would recommend this movie for awesome story and wonderful acting; but not for the effects.,Waves

151,madisonquince-45561,I audibly gasped and you should too,10,1 May 2021,When I say I have NEVER written a review I mean it... I live off this app and never review... but this movie was so incredible I had to. The pace and the cinematography were effortless but the acting and the plot will have you hooked from the opening scenes. At the climax of the film I gasped and my mouth didn't move for several minutes. That is what I assume it's supposed to do because its effect is tantalising and necessary for the viewer to understand what the dialogue is telling you. Mistakes are moments that are brought on by choices that can change your life. Then the film just switches and takes on an incredibly different pace... one that still leaves you as breathless as before. I let this movie sit on my watch list for far too long. Don't let it sit on yours!,Waves
152,trent-24719,One of the best films of 2019,9,21 January 2020,"I would like to boast about the technical aspects of this film, that have so stunningly taken the story to dimensions that tear deep into your heart.
This mashup of brilliant cinematography, editing and a magnificent score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. This film speaks to two generations that are keeping their head above the smog of the world that we live in. It is a truly stunning representation of the joys and sufferings of what it is to keep the bond of family alive.This is a gem of a film that probably wont get as much of the recognition it needs but it certainly serves as one of 2019's best feature films and A24 has certainly done it again. Well done.",Waves
153,yagizerdikk,Give me back my 2 hours!!!!,2,29 November 2020,It's super slow super boring but that's not the point cause I just was expecting something meaningful such as relationships or some conversations that it can fill it up me but nah! It was just emptiness that's it. Do not waste your time and do not believe those guys who wrote a review like ' ohh Soundtracks were amazing ' 2+2=4 so you can't change the fact about movie both goddamn soundtracks!,Waves
154,sammart-36654,Pretentious as heck with no order,3,3 June 2020,This movie is boring and very self indulgent. It starts off strong but then makes the decision to hit the reset button and become an episodic mess that doesn't go anywhere. There is a theme here if you dig deep enough about moving on and forgiveness. But it trades all of its narrative for pretty shots and music videos. Literally have this movie is a music video. All emotion with no plot. I couldn't wait for it to end.,Waves
155,colt-01085,A giant leap in the right direction for Shults.,7,17 February 2020,"As a follow up to It Comes at Night, Waves is a giant leap in the right direction for Shults. A poignant and impactful drama about a family's spiral downward into tragedy and climb back up after it. The cast (especially Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Lucas Hedges) deliver tonally perfect, emotional performances of authentic and complex, well-written characters. The screenplay for Waves is clearly a great piece of writing.Where the film struggles, is in it's over-use of aesthetic and it's seeming inability to progress action and play music at the same time. The use of neon, lense flare, strobe effects, and graphics were each independently beautiful but I found the film too often paused its narrative for a musical interlude or technicolour light montage that eventually left me impatiently waiting for the story to start again. Many of the editing effects used were effective and very interesting, my only complaint here is that there were too many of them.I do recommend Waves. It's a challenging screenplay that's met by a cast of fantastic actors who manage to tell a meaningful and all too realistic story, despite some over-editing.",Waves
156,shannonnorgaard,This Movie Broke Me...,9,29 February 2020,"I haven't cried watching a movie like this in years. I have lived through a lot of the issues addressed in this film so it truly affected me. Amazing acting from all involved, brilliant directing, and editing. I don't understand why this wasn't a contender during awards seasons, it's baffling to me and makes me realize how much politics, power, money, etc. probably go into nominations and all that crap because this deserved to be at the top in numerous categories. So for now I will savor it....",Waves

158,rneill-71817,Realistic,10,20 November 2019,"This movie gave us the brutal truth of how love, our identity and relationships can go without sympathy. It brought us a fresh soundtrack that fits the age group and time period as well as new camera techniques and plenty of engaging long takes! The freshest movie i've seen since call me by your name and moonlight (and this movie is on the same emotional as those two movies) and definitely recommend it!",Waves
159,cameronlogan-33883,MINUTE REVIEW: 'Waves do die',6,21 March 2020,"If waves was just the first hour and condensed into a short film i would say its one of the best movies ever. Instead 'waves' after the climax of the movie is one of the most drawn out experiences of my life. 45% of the movie had some of the best camera work, soundtrack, and performances just to blow it all with its over detailed ending that is touching and deserves its attention but not to the degree at which it was. Watch waves because the 1st hour is without a doubt worth it.

160,Barbarajohnproduction,Amazing !!!!,10,24 January 2020,"This movie is amazing, I cried during all the screen.
It's emotionally incredible. If you like to feel emotions during a movie go for it.
Trey Edward Shults is so talented!
He inspired me so much. 10/10 for Waves",Waves
161,pmbrockrat,If zero was a rating .....,1,1 February 2020,Clearly the good reviews are family and friends or kiss asses. How did this win any awards? The Wave scenes are for a drug trip and made me want to fast forward...Can I please have that time back in life? Might be the worst movie of all time.,Waves
162,ampairwe-05226,Fantastic,10,23 February 2020,"This movie right here deserves a  A because this is really happening in real life. The story is absolutely great. The clarity is perfect. For sure, I'm impressed.",Waves
163,matildabraithwaite,My new favourite film,10,26 February 2020,"This film spoke volumes, it made me feel things I didn't think I could feel. It follows a black families struggle with the growth of their son, who is physically and emotionally exhausted but doesn't know it yet. His world is put on hold when he gets a sports injury which if ignored could end it all, like any 17-18 year old high school boy he ignores it to please his father. His relationship with his girlfriend is captivating and beautiful, the two of them show you what real love is like- sacrifice. But whilst the problems get worse for the golden boy, we fail to notice the sister who in herself is an untouched beauty. She is the hidden gem in the whole film, the second half of the film watches her pain, sorrow and growth all unfold. She is that M&M that you find right in the corner of the packet right when your about to throw the packet away, and the taste of this M&M doesn't just fade like the others it lingers in your mouth. That's how I felt about her at the end of the film, I felt touched by her, I felt connected to her, almost like I was with her. Definitely when I watch it again I will understand her character more and more each time, the development of her is delayed and sudden but in a way just right. I will warn anyone about to watch this extraordinary film it is very emotional at multiple times, at least it was for me it brought out a side of emotions I hadn't been in touch with for a long time. Overall a breathtakingly alluring film, which I would recommend to anyone craving a heartfelt and moving watch.",Waves

As a teen in high school it Really shows how high schoolers really are now a days, And I can tell u that from experiencing things like this. I love how the movie was so realistic cause this is how life is now a days and I love it. And I don't think some adults understand that but, It's such a sad movie though but it has a very good message to it I would definitely recommend this movie.",Waves

167,adamakbar-29295,Style Over Any Substance,6,18 July 2021,"I love films, always had a huge passion across many genres and also across many nationalities. There is beauty in film as well as great learning.So, having read the reviews, I was genuinely intrigued and excited to watch Waves. It did not last long.Very rarely do I switch off a film before the end but this was one film I did.Let's speak about the positives first. Great acting. Truly impressive performances by the whole ensemble. Everyone was relatable and delivered with aplomb.However, the over stylised approach and painfully weak script made this hard viewing. It's a movie you want to succeed because of the actors, who deserve better. But whoever wrote this screenplay needs to reconsider their ambitions as this lacked any.A plotline that is so banal and ultimately lacks any innovation is frustrating enough but the attempt to overlay this with a 'edgy' musical score that only adds dysfucntion, made for hard viewing. I'll be honest. I got fed up with the club handed approach to this story. There was no nuanced element other that what the actors provided through their talent. A major disappointment sadly.",Waves
168,Lauren-Ybarra,Best Film of the Year,10,8 November 2019,I saw Waves at the Denver Film Festival and it is the most beautifully told cinematic masterpiece I have ever seen. You've never seen any movie as well done as Waves.,Waves
169,stellayanakieva,Drama done beautifully!,9,2 February 2020,"The story unfolds slowly but it is one worth waiting for. It's a portrayal of pain and trauma that addresses many important issues, such as mental health, pill addiction, teenage vulnerability, and societal expectations.We are not monsters. We are just human beings who hurt and make mistakes. We are all broken in one way or another. We all need a shoulder to cry on from time to time & for this one you'll definitely need one.Brilliant acting from Sterling K. Brown and Kelvin Harrison Jr., breathtaking cinematography and amazing soundtrack.Can't recommend enough - go see it with an open heart!",Waves

171,rachel-buchanan14,A beautiful and powerful look at grief,10,17 July 2020,"I don't understand the poor reviews here. The film was beautiful and I especially loved the second half from Emily's perspective, which some people don't seem to appreciate. The first half definitely has more excitement to it, but what do you expect? It's a film about loss. In fact I loved the duality of storytelling. Starts out high, with a comedown dealing with reality.I think this film really encapsulates how difficult grieving such an awful situation can be, while keeping in mind all of the love and beauty around us. It really made me think about anger, love, sadness, and togetherness in times of loss and tragedy.The performances are fantastic, the soundtrack is superb, the cinematography is also excellent. I'm surprised it didn't get nominated for any major awards.",Waves

Must see.,10,13 April 2020,"I don't understand all the bad reviews because this film was one of the BEST movies I've watched in a very long time. Beautifully filmed and such an emotional, gripping story that made me feel so many emotions all at once.
I was slightly put off because the trailer wasn't very gripping but now I realise it's because it would give too much away if it showed any more. Please ignore the bad reviews and give it a watch, you won't regret it!",Waves
174,marshasteinback,Couldn't wait for Waves to end.,4,29 October 2019,"My friends and I thought we watched a couple of movies last night. The character development in the first half was slim at best depending on music and gadgetry to do the work for the writers. The second half was better but seemed to tie things up in a feel good story tale ending, even introducing a deathbed father who we had hardly heard about at the end to completely the fairytale. I thought nothing was left on the cutting room floor until the Q&A afterward when the director said that the original was 3 1/2 hours. I consider this movie an example of directorial narcissism.",Waves

178,kev_1515,Fantastic Moments Framed in Incoherence,4,3 December 2020,"This film has a series of 8-10 scenes that are intensely and humanly connected and those moments are a joy to watch. They are poignant, beautiful and sorrowful moments that make the audience this film might pull off a good story by the time it ends. Another positive is that the acting throughout the film was quite good. They sold very tough scenes and emotions despite the lack of clear character orientation. So why the low score? These wonderful elements are framed with incoherent and inconsistent story telling. The breaks in character psyche and logic are so severe that it makes important scenes entirely unbelievable. The jumps in time make the audience completely lose stride with important characters. It's really too bad because the basis of the story really had a ton of potential, but it was ultimately ruined by a film-maker that appears to try to take the spotlight instead of believing in his story and actors to get him there.",Waves
179,obitosdespair,tried too hard being sentimental and hysterical.,6,11 March 2020,"I didn't think the movie was bad, but i want to write down why I can't give it more than a 6.The story didn't feel cohesive. I still don't understand the purpose of the deathbed arc. It feels like they ditched out on the first half of the story, leaving it unfinished. The overall plot also felt simple without much depth and complexity.The acting was great, the facial expressions were great. However the screenplay would often be overshadowed by the 'background' music. It felt like i was forced to listen to some artsy dude's Spotify playlist. At one point i even had to mute the sound because it was so disconnecting to the story. It also feels like the director and screenwriters used the music as a quick-fix to do their work for them.The movie tried hard to evoke emotional feelings from the viewer, but would often fail. The storyline didn't have a real direction and didn't manage to develop any real connection with the characters. Come 3/4 of the movie I was just waiting for it to finish.",Waves
180,ayanathebeautiful,If you like beautiful movies then you'll love this movie,9,6 August 2020,"If you're like me & love beautiful, emotional, character driven dramas, then you'll love this movie. If this movie starred freggin Timothee Chalamet and the chick from Ladybird & Little Women and was surrounded by a white supporting cast it would've been nominated for every Oscar category available. 2020 has been so long I forgot the academy awards for the 2019 year had already happened, and I was sick to find out that this movie wasn't nominated for anything. Everything about this movie is beautifully done; the direction, the cinematography, the music, the acting, all phenomenal. I genuinely cannot think of why it wasn't nominated for a single major award other than the main characters being brown.My only complaint is the sound quality of the dialogue. It's hard to hear what people are saying in scenes with loud music in the background. Other than that, this movie is great. We need more movies like this.",Waves
