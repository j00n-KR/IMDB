0,MartinHafer,A rather amazing film.,8,26 October 2017,"Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead wanted to make a film. The problem is that they're newcomers to filmmaking and didn't have the millions it usually costs to make a movie. So, they chose to star in the film, direct, produce and Benson wrote the script! In addition, although the film has some sci-fi/supernatural elements, they managed to create some stunning special effects on the cheap! Watching it is like a lesson on economical filmmaking...and it's a darned good film to boot!Justin and Aaron (yes, the filmmakers use their real names) both apparently left a cult many years ago. Unfortunately, their lives have sucked since and not Aaron is growing wistful and wants to return to this cult for at least a visit. Exasperated, his brother eventually agrees to make the drive to the middle of no where. And, not surprisingly Aaron LOVES the place and wants to stay. Justin, on the other hand, soon learns more about the place and is scared to death...as Aaron eventually will be as well.I would try to explain more about the plot but it's almost impossible to describe the plot. Instead, just watch it with an open mind and enjoy the high quality of the production. It's also a film with a few funny moments as well as harrowing ones...and a film that I am very happy I saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival.",The Endless
1,SnoopyStyle,great rope scene,6,26 June 2018,"Two brothers receive a video from a cult they escaped years earlier. Older brother Justin Smith had pulled his younger brother Aaron out believing the group to be a death cult and insists that they had committed mass suicide. Aaron remembers nothing but good times. Justin admits that he had not actually witness any deaths. They go back to examine their vastly different past experiences. Aaron falls for Anna. There is something surreal happening within the camp.The premise is interesting. I love the rope scene. It is simple and compelling. It's a simple in camera effect which isn't even that difficult. What it is is that it presented something mysterious and intriguing. It is the best idea ever. Then the special effects get surreal and random. It stops being compelling. As for the actors, the two brothers are lackluster. They don't have much personality and honestly, sometimes I confused them. At a certain point, I stopped caring. It's a standard indie failing. They need at least one top level actor but they don't have it here. Also, Justin needs better motivation to go back. The movie isn't clear enough. Quite frankly, he would probably hide from it rather than confront it. This indie has some greatness in it but not consistently great.",The Endless
2,kosmasp,Resolution,8,6 April 2018,"I have not seen the Spring movie yet (I bought it because it got recommended to me by a lot of people), but I have seen the previous stand alone future movie they did - Resolution. And let's say it did prepare me for this. Because while this looks like one thing and kind of is, there are layers upon layers to this. Usually when directors act in their own stuff, in low budget movies especially, nothing much comes out of that.This is an exception if you want to call it that. Then again, you will only be able to enjoy this movie if you have some patience and if you are willing to get with the flow of the movie and the pace it sets. Also its weirdness ... a lot of weirdness going on. Many questions, not so many answers. Can you dig that? If so, this is really exceptional",The Endless
3,Sleepin_Dragon,Rather good to be honest.,7,28 March 2019,"I'm almost pained to watch ant film that has the tag of horror on it, as the results are so often a disappointment. The Endless however, had something I've longed for, and a level of originality that seems so rare these daysYou can see it isn't exactly huge budget, but that arguably helped, a reliance more so on acring and story, rather then on mind blowing special effects. Admittedly a few scenes looked a but poor, notably the appearance of the Mountain Lion, but others such as the rope, looked great.I loved the concept of the film, and that it left us wondering so many points. Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson did a great job.I really enjoyed it. 7/10",The Endless
4,gavin6942,A Defining Film of 2017,7,22 April 2017,"Two brothers return to the cult they fled from years ago to discover that the group's beliefs may be more sane than they once thought.This film is more clever than it first appears, because it operates on at least two levels. On the surface, it is a taut, well-crafted horror story about a (possible) ""death cult"". We have some mysterious rituals, a missing husband, and seemingly silly camp activities that may – or may not – have a darker purpose.Some of this is vaguely alluded to in the opening quote from H. P. Lovecraft, and further still during the lake ""reveal"". The scare quotes here are just because what is revealed at this moment is entirely up to the imaginations of the viewer. A certain Lovecraft story may provide a guide, or it may be merely a coincidence or red herring. But once the big reveal comes, everything goes dark, and the suspense truly becomes horror.The subcutaneous level is focused on a theme: the truth of religion, either this one or religion in general. Though this film really only explores the reality of one (fictional) religion, it does make us wonder: what if some religions we find strange are actually right? With so many religions in the world, it is certainly possible that one or more are correct. And if the strangest ones might be right, we ought to question our own beliefs: do we believe correctly? With so many choices, it is hard to say for sure.Though this deeper meaning may not have been intentional, it nevertheless exists and makes the film even more interesting. The filmmakers previously had a hit with ""Resolution"" (2012), but all signs point to ""The Endless"" being an even bigger success. The film played at Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, and will no doubt be seen by a wider audience throughout 2017.",The Endless
5,george.schmidt,Not even Mulder and Scully would want to continue this investigation.,7,23 April 2018,"THE ENDLESS (2018) ** Justin Benson, Aaron Moorhead, Callie Hernandez, Lew Temple, James Jordan, Tate Ellington, Emily Montague, Kira Powell, Vinny Curran, David Lawson, Jr., Peter Cilella. Hit-and-miss indie thriller about two brothers (Benson and Moorhead who collaborated on the script co-directed) who decide to return to the cult they fled years ago in an attempt to make sense of their lives from 'civilization' with some 'be careful what you wished for' consequences. Deadpan humor and a distinct feeling of dread with some fairly impressive visuals can't make up for the plot holes (um, no federal investigation occurred in all that time of their very public escape?!) and its final act of 'let's see if this works/kitchen sink' work method. Not even Mulder and Scully would want to continue this investigation.",The Endless
6,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,2,22 October 2018,"The Endless has an awful premise and not much else.It really didn't matter what it was, nothing was saving this film. It's tolerable, because it's a mystery for most of the duration. Other than Justin who also wrote and directed the film, none of the characters had anything to offer. Why did these brothers not have their own lives? Just because you live and work together, doesn't mean you spend every second together. Another film these guys did though ""Spring,"" terrific.",The Endless
7,deloudelouvain,A missed opportunity.,5,9 August 2018,"First of all The Endless is not a horror movie so it's not necessary to put it in that genre, something that happens all the time on IMDb and that I quite honestly hate. It's fantasy and sci-fi and that's it. The good things about this movie is the idea of the story, it's intriguing and full of mystery, and the acting was not bad either. The bad thing is that I thought the story was just not elaborated enough, you'll be stuck with unanswered questions and that's never pleasant. It's not that I had to endure this movie, not at all, but it could have been much better. It's a low budget and that shows, with mediocre visual effects. To me it's a missed opportunity to bring a good movie with a mysterious story. But everybody is entitled to his opinion.",The Endless
8,christopher-underwood,fascinating and intriguing,7,27 November 2020,"A most likeable and well constructed affair, with directors Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson sharing out many filmmaking duties including that of the two leads. After a startling beginning the mystery deepens as we follow the two brothers as they re-visit a cult they had been with as youngsters. Everything is dealt with naturalistically and it is both fascinating and intriguing to gradually find out more and discover just what goes on in this cult as we begin to look at the members in a little more askance manner as the brothers disagree on whether to stay another night. As the weirdness level increases Moorhead and Benson are so convincing that we stay with them and it is only as we crash towards the very end that the special effects and science-fi element begins to stretch our credibility. Very enjoyable ride, however, and a good feeling engendered throughout, even though this must all have been achieved on a minimal budget. Excellent effort.",The Endless
9,thesar-2,The Wicker Men,5,13 January 2019,"Well, at almost two hours, it sure felt that way.How now brown cow...or so the movie looks. Soooo brown! I live in Arizona, U.S.A. and hate the brown, so this was a tad hard to watch. Oh, well that and the predictability.Two bros, er, brothers are struggling after escaping a cult in the desert. One can't stop thinking about how ""great"" things were on the ranch and they both decide to go back and rekindle cult-status. Only, it's just as foretold as you'd expect.Hotel California is probably my all-time favorite song. I never get tired of hearing it and even love the Spanish version from The Big Lebowski. This is the semi-version of that song and could've been so much more with a few more re-writes. In fact, even at 2-hours, it could've expanded so much more to so much more depth.So sad. This had such potential. No need for a sequel. Just reboot it with a bigger budget and tighter script.Welcome to Hotel California! You can check in, and escape, I guess.***Final thoughts: There was so much here to explore. Here: just make up your own movie while watching this. You're sure to come up with something grand and hopefully less brown.",The Endless
10,FeastMode,my notes,1,26 July 2019,Worst movie ever. just a bunch of madness that happens to be excruciatingly boring and pointless. crappy quality everything. felt like a tv movie. these critic and user ratings are baffling (1 viewing),The Endless
11,westsideschl,What Time is It?,4,15 July 2018,"On a positive rating note the raw idea of spending eternity in a time loop is an interesting plot premise. 
On many negative notes it is worth two to four stars. 
1. Time loops are impossible because they require going back in time - a no-no, but fun to talk (make films) about. Not explained was how they took place; did they effect each person differently; at what age do they come back as; long long do they last; ways of ending it had contradictory outcomes.
2. Cheap special effects of CGI force field bubbles; three moons in the sky; pulling on a rope seemingly stretching out into wherever. First, overused; second, makes no sense; third, still another mystery creator is a film no show; fourth, the reliance on old tech film rolls capable of running backward makes no sense as a visual or causal explanation.
3. Dialogue in trying to be philosophical was all over the place, sort of institutional patient illogical. 2' by 2' chalk blackboard w/single equation as an explanatory hook - nope!
4. Not much of what you could label as acting took place. 
5. Another open ended (meaning they couldn't figure out an ending that makes sense) thus our car running w/no gas suggests ...",The Endless
12,851222,Original and fresh movie gem,8,29 September 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Endless"" (2017) is a great movie example of what happens when you don't have big money but have a great idea and concept. This is a highly original movie which will make you think until the closing scene and further. The story itself is the star of the movie. Also movie making was very good - they used every thick in the book to make this movie look like that without big budget.Overall, ""The Endless"" is a highly original little movie gem. Some won't like it, but if you are tired from all the cliched sci-fi superhero flicks, look up for this movie, its a pretty rare thing.",The Endless

This was just really incredible. The acting was superbly natural. The cinematography was awesome, as was the visual effects. I enjoyed the fact that the visuals never took over the screen.

15,Thanos_Alfie,Very good idea but average execution...,6,7 December 2018,"""The Endless"" is a Sci-Fi - Horror movie in which we watch two brothers who receive a cryptic video message in a videotape which bring some memories to them and inspire them to revisit the UFO death cult. They both escaped from there a decade earlier but now they hope to find the answers they were seeking for many years but they couldn't find as young men. The members prepare a mysterious event for them and the brothers start their own race in order to reveal the impossible truth before they are getting trapped with the cult.I liked very much the idea of this movie which I found very new and because I have never watched something similar before. Unfortunately, the direction which was made by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead who are both the main actors in this movie didn't help at all. They created some plot holes that weren't covered at all in the movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention that I liked the interpretation of Justin Benson who played as Justin one of the two brothers and he was very good at it. I didn't like the interpretations of Aaron Moorhead's who played as Aaron and I believe he didn't reach his potential and Tate Ellington's who played as Hal and wasn't so good.In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Endless"" isn't a bad movie just an average movie with the potential of being an amazing one. I don't regret watching this movie I am just a bit disappointed by it because it could be a very good movie. It has an interesting plot and a great idea for a movie but the execution of it isn't the best.",The Endless
16,cruise01,A bit slow but intriguing and creepy.,8,29 October 2018,"The Endless (4 out of 5 stars).The Endless is a trippy science fiction horror film that will have an effect on the audiences psychologically and creating that paranoia creepy feeling. A concept about brothers that escaped a cult when they were teens. Only to visit the cult as adults, cause they received some video on the mail that they felt like their group of people were going to commit a mass suicide. For those, that enjoy the mythical concept idea of Lovecraftian entity and so on would definitely find this entertaining.The plot is definitely one of those movies, were it is best to see it without knowing much about it. Avoid reading spoilers or seeing trailers/clips. Brothers Justin and Aaron (Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead) are both wanting to visit a group of people they know that lives out in the middle of nowhere. They left when they were younger cause they feared the cult was not any good to them. After receiving a mysterious video that they feared the group lives are at stake. They visit them and see that their old friends and everyone are all happy and still participating in their daily routine. However, they both start to become very suspicious when they notice every thing is strange. Which they fear the group may know something that they do not? Or could there paranoia really be getting to them?The plot was a great mystery concept that throws in some Lovecraftian themes. There are plenty of creepy moments. When the brothers feels like they are being watched by something. Or shadows of something bigger. The idea of the cult and their reason to their activities is also kind of creepy. I was never once bored with the movie. I was intrigued to see more but when the climax happens with the brothers trying to escape it is intense.Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are both good with their characters. Playing brothers that wants a better life for themselves. But they both care about the friends and people they once knew in the cult.The film does have a slower pace in the second act when the brothers are visiting the people in the cult and hearing their perspective on what lays ahead. Overall, The Endless is a good science fiction horror film. The concept and plot is mysterious and creepy. And the acting is good. The cinematography was good as it captures the feeling that the characters are always being watched by something.",The Endless
17,eddie_baggins,A wickedly inventive low-budget hybrid,6,1 July 2019,"A high-concept and low-budget effort, after the underrated and really quite good Spring from 2014, The Endless see's directing (and this time acting) duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead once more showcase some serious talent, talent that suggests we're not far away from witnessing something truly special from the still up and coming combo.While not as efficient and well-rounded as Spring, The Endless offers up another mind-bending offering from the team that will keep you guessing right the way through with the combination of sci-fi and horror making this independent offering a unique and sometimes mind-melting affair.A slow-burning offering that takes a little too long to truly get going, The Endless focuses on Moorhead and Benson playing two brothers, who at a young age escaped a potentially dangerous UFO believing cult, whose habitat out in the American wildlands holds some dark and nefarious secrets.Trying to live a normal life hasn't really worked out too well for the brothers so they decide its best to pay their old cult buddies a visit and see if they can find answers in the past to help with their future, only to discover that leaving the cult and its lands won't be as easy as they would've hoped.Saying too much more about the mystery at the core of this tale would ruin much of the fun to be had but there's no doubt Moorhead and Benson have crafted a seriously wicked little yarn that is nothing short of devilishly inventive, even if it doesn't always feel like the payoff or explanation is as good as the idea at the core of the whole mysterious outing.Taking some cues from classic genre offerings like Primer, Looper and even of all things Groundhog Day, The Endless doesn't always click and perhaps is slightly disappointing in the character development field with Aaron and Justin not the most interesting characters, as well as not being amazingly played by the directing partners, but at least there's a heartfelt effort here with a strong insistence on being constantly inventive and even wickedly fun in parts.Final Say -A high-reaching effort that is more intriguingly conceived more than astoundingly delivered, Moorhead and Benson have crafted a likable next offering after the success of Spring, which helps solidify the duo as an extremely exciting film-making pair.3 unreliable vans out of 5",The Endless
18,howard.schumann,The Gods Must be Crazy,8,9 May 2018,"Ignoring Thomas Wolfe's observation that ""You can't go home again,"" brothers Justin (Justin Benson, ""Dementia"") and Aaron Smith (Aaron Moorhead, ""Contracted: Phase II""), as an expression of completion, return to a California cult from which they had escaped ten years ago. Written and directed by Benson and Moorhead, The Endless is a low-budget psychological drama that juggles elements of horror and science fiction, unfolding in a world where reality is malleable and where past, present, and future exist simultaneously. Opening with a quote from legendary fantasy/horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, ""The oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,"" the film plays with time loops and apocalyptic visions, but its basic element is the relationship between siblings Aaron and Justin and their desire for mutual support.Living in poverty and adrift in a world that offers little satisfaction for them, Justin and Aaron become nostalgic for Camp Arcadia when they discover a mysterious video tape with a message from Anna (Callie Hernandez, ""Alien: Covenant""), a woman they knew at the commune. Reminded of the sense of security they felt at the camp, the friendships they made, and especially the good food they can almost taste, Aaron suggests that they visit the commune for one day and a skeptical Justin agrees to keep his brother happy. Their return is full of some trepidation as they recall stories about a ""death cult,"" but when they arrive and find that very little seems to have changed and no one seems to have aged, they believe that they have made a good choice.As things turn out, however, they probably wish that they had taken more time to consider their decision. Hal (Tate Ellington, ""Straight Outta Compton"") greets them first and welcomes them back to the camp. (He says that he's not really the leader, just someone who talks more than the others). They also meet ""Smiling Dave"" (David Lawson Jr., ""Resolution"") who never speaks presumably because he drilled a hole in his skull to find God, Jennifer Danube (Emily Montague, ""Fright Night""), a woman who leaves notes all around requesting quiet, Tim (Lew Temple, ""Kidnap"") who forgives Justin for spreading false rumors about the camp after he left, and a perpetually angry fellow named ""Shitty Carl"" (James Jordan, ""Wind River"") whose own hanging corpse keeps him company in his shed.Almost immediately, the brothers take part in bonding rituals, performing magic tricks with adept Shane Williams (Shane Brady, ""Spring"") and participating in a tug of war with an immeasurably long rope that connects to something in the sky that we can only imagine. With the insistent music of Jimmy Lavalle setting a menacing tone, all the fun and games soon morph into eerie happenings, governed by an unseen entity. Birds fly in a pattern in one direction, then instantaneously reverse course and fly in the opposite direction, huge trees decide to fall to the ground without warning, a tiger meanders through an opening in the woods, and other nerve jangling events including the sighting of totems, metallic dragon demons, and a monolith they carved on a tree or stone many years ago. One might sensibly conclude that the Gods must be crazy.While it may be too facile to say that the time loops are endless, Benson ""explains"" them this way, ""So when you cross into one past, you come to a different loop each time. If you want to be really specific, the radius or diameter of the circles they form, as it gets bigger, the loop gets longer and as they get smaller, the loops get smaller"" - or whatever. In spite of the weirdness (or perhaps because of it), Aaron wants to stay another night and then another and the conversation between the brothers about whether to stay or leave becomes central to the film. The not overly friendly cosmic force, however, has something to say in the proceedings and no matter how much the brothers try to leave, they find themselves right back where they started.The Endless is not a typical in-your-face horror film that leaves blood splattered in your lap, but a much more cerebral experience in which the characters are people you can recognize from your own life, people that you can care about. Although some of the scares come across as being contrived and unconvincing, there are enough thrills to keep you involved from beginning to end. Though its message of forgiveness resonates as does the growing connection between Aaron and Justin, to fully understand its message, stay tuned for the inevitable sequels. They could be endless.",The Endless
19,TheMovieDiorama,The Endless repetitiously increases its cosmic horror through its convoluted complexity.,6,23 August 2019,"Whenever a feature, particularly an indie flick, commences its story with a quote from Lovecraft, you just know you're in for a bizarre journey. To review The Endless' plot would be to spoil the enigmatic mystery, so apologies in advance if I rarely touch upon it. Having said that, absolute credit must given to Benson and Moorhead for comprising the film's entirety from the ground up. Impressive on such a low budget. A shame that the further the story progresses, its staying power is also lost due to its vastly convoluted plot that will leave you perplexed for a decent hour of its runtime. Two brothers who escaped a ""UFO death cult"" visit the campsite again after receiving a mysterious tape through the post.Originality is the essence of filmmaking brilliance. It's so rare for modern cinema to host surrealism, mostly due to its non-marketable premise, that both Moorhead and Benson should be revered as creative geniuses. Even if, in my opinion, the plot's complexity is its downfall. Praise must be given for even attempting to convey such ambition. Lovecraftian thrills alluding to the trapped mind state of a devout religious cult member, segregated from society. Comparing the idyllic civilised lifestyle of a brainwashed member to the fearful freedom of the outside world where opportunities seem so infrequent.Bolstered by surreal imagery, The Endless attempts to compel by sporadically implementing ostentatious breadcrumbs to unravel its absurd science-fiction premise, but its labyrinthine complexity forces other technical aspects to decrease in quality. As I said, Benson and Moorhead are multi-talented individuals. Both directing this convoluted behemoth, starring as lead actors, editing, writing, producing and providing the cinematography. But their mass involvement has meant that every element is rough around the edges. The writing often delves into synchronous banter between the two brothers that felt unnatural and often missed the mark. The writing to explain the concept? Great, if a little expositional. In contrast, the characters lack that personable touch, exhuming unusual dynamics that impossibly describe an impossible situation. The banter occasionally addresses this, but when discussing the difference between ""sleeping with someone"" and ""going to sleep with someone"", it skews the tone.The cinematography, resembling the circular symbolism embedded throughout, was somewhat distracting. The outskirts of the camera lens being squished to force this circular vision, with the colour grading offering a pale perspective. The editing was often harsh and abrupt, cutting a scene and then randomly appearing halfway through a different conversation. And of course the disparity in concept detailing and character development meant that the third act lost a portion of its humanity that was built effortlessly in the first act. The performances however all felt realistic and allowed the concept to breathe through naturally. Always good to end on a positive.The Endless is described as a horror. It's not. Even reaching out to its Lovecraftian roots would prove futile in the search for endless scares. It's pure mystery, with an original concept so grand that it unfortunately doesn't stick the landing. Yet I'd happily see more from these two, as I believe their efforts on all levels should be eternally praised.",The Endless

21,jtindahouse,"Weird, creepy and a fun watch",7,23 July 2019,"Very rarely do I watch movies on the Rialto channel but I was flicking through the other day and 'The Endless' came up on the planner. It sounded interesting and after a quick glimpse at the trailer I decided to give it a go. It pretty much fit exactly into my perception of Rialto channel movies. To be frank, it was weird. But weird in a good way if that makes sense. This film goes to some utterly bizarre places.The film starts out straight-forward enough. A couple of brothers return to the cult they left years ago. The first half of the film is spent introducing us to characters and creating mystery around the true motivations of the cult. The occasional weird thing is happening, but nothing too over the top at this stage. Then in the second half of the movie all hell breaks loose and we go to crazy town. I would have to say I actually enjoyed the first half of the movie more. In fact I would really like to see this film given a conlusion to the way it starts out that wasn't supernatural in any way. That's the film I would have preferred to see.But what we got certainly wasn't bad. It's a movie where you never know what is going to happen next and I loved that about it. It also feels like anything can and will happen, also a major plus. The cast were actually the biggest surprise of all for me. For a clearly low-budget film they did extremely well. Creepy when they needed to be, mysterious at other times, they nailed all the marks. And it must be said this film does get very creepy in certain places. I had a good time with 'The Endless' and I look forward to going back and watching these filmmaker's earlier films.",The Endless
22,dfranzen70,A must-see for fans of the warping of time and space,7,18 October 2017,"Two grown brothers, who escaped a cult when they were kids, receive a video from same cult, enticing them to return. The older Justin (Justin Benson) has vivid and terrible memories of their time with the group, but younger Aaron (Aaron Moorhead)has just hazy memories of pleasant times. So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually.But it isn't too long before things get a little unsettling. No spoilers here; the cult believes there is an all-powerful deity who exists only for them – i.e., not a God from any other religion. This entity sends the group messages via cassette tapes and Polaroid photos. The group members pass this all off as normal; to be truthful, I found their happiness to be a bit unsettling. But Aaron, the younger/more impressionable of the brothers, wants to believe and is definitely looking for some structure in his life after a decade of menial jobs and no real direction. His wiser brother Justin, is strongly skeptical, but certain events do make him question his own sense of righteousness.So this seems like a pretty straightforward story, doesn't it? Maybe there's something to the cult's thinking, maybe they're really just harmlessly living off the grid. But then a few somethings happen, and the movie switches from being about a crazed cult into being about, well, the neverending loop of reality. And that's when the movie really takes off. I'm talking about mindbending twists and some terrific special effects. Just like that, the plot zooms from just sort of floating about, intriguing but not enticing, and then it blasts into overdrive. And suddenly nothing makes sense, and everything makes sense. It's a huge trip.For that reason, I really enjoyed this movie, the third I saw at this year's Spooky Movie International Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Endless was written by Benson and directed by Benson and Moorhead, and they score with all aspects of their work here. If you're looking for a distorted-reality movie, check out The Endless.",The Endless

There is scant science, but lots of fiction; that is not is science-fiction. It reminded me of the Blair Witch Project with lots of bells and whistles. That film was a hustle, and so is this one. The final scenes induce unintentional laughter from the viewer. There are some interesting scenes, however, they are crushed by the weight of too much dialogue and rumination. Talky films are seldom successful. Don't wate your money renting this turkey.",The Endless
28,truemythmedia,Intelligent Thriller,9,17 June 2019,"Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead's ""The Endless"" is about as good as a small budget, horror/sci fi/thriller film can be. It's expertly written and almost perfectly executed; it's incredibly atmospheric; frightening, disturbing, and sometimes surprisingly funny; it's exquisitely paced; and best of all, though the rules of world are bizarre and strange, it all makes sense. Had it not been for one scene- quite literally one scene- this film would've received a perfect score from me.

29,robertemerald,Adorable indie sci fi thriller,8,10 October 2018,"The wonderful love between the two brothers tends to overshadow the buildup of tension in this strange little gem. Oddly, if this was a movie about brotherhood with no reference to sci fi I'd probably still give it a good review. There was also the theme of surrogate parenthood (rather than 'cults' per say) that was moving and original. This is an intelligent movie, and gives one thought. The sci fi element is like that too. It's just within the bounds of credibility. The effects here are good (especially as they conform to this 'bounds of credibility' I just mentioned.). If I did have a criticism then its along the lines of my first point, in that when the full tension does hit its a long way from the beginning. That's the slight contradiction in this movie, but also its charm. Heart warming sci fi for everyone.",The Endless
30,davidmvining,A real sense of terror accomplished without any money,8,22 November 2019,"Ah, cheap micro-budgeted filmmakers. How often they go wrong, but when they go right, magic happens.Aaron Moorehead and Justin Benson are a writer/director pair that have managed to make a handful of movies on virtually no money. They are models to be admired. The Endless is the first of their films I've seen, and I think it's a wonderful example of what a smart script, tight direction, and solid acting can accomplish even without any real financial backing.The two play the movie's two main characters (Aaron and Justin, oddly enough) are brothers who escaped from a death cult ten years before. They live a meager existence cleaning apartments and eating ramen when a package arrives with a video tape from the camp they left. Prompted by that and their general miserable existence, Aaron convinces Justin that they should visit only for a day.They go and life is ideal. Everyone's happy. Everyone's useful and doing what they want to do. It seems so much better than their memories and their fears led them to believe, but there are eerie things happening around them. They see a man, marching around the area with strictly determined focus that borders on hostility. There's a woman who cries for her missing husband. There's a lake where they go to fish and Justin is scared beyond reason at the sight of something he sees underwater when he goes diving. There's something wrong with this life, and no one can explain why.The movie actually begins with an H.P. Lovecraft quote, so going through all of these motions with that in the back of your mind makes the end point rather clear. There's a horror that cannot be explained or reasoned lurking around every corner.This is when we get introduced to the trippier part of the story. I don't think it holds together completely (it might, but it feels like there are a few holes in the logic placed there for dramatic purposes), but it overall adds to the pervasive sense of impending doom in such a great way. The writer/director pair understand how to use images and especially sound design to heighten tension. And that's really what drives the movie forward through the end. That feeling of dread and tension that just keeps building until its climax.On top of that, characterization is wonderful. The two brothers not only feel like brothers (with all the minor bickering that that entails) but they also have completely different sets of beliefs that set them apart and make them distinct. Even the most minor of characters (like the gun tweeker and his friend whom we see for about 5 minutes) have a breadth of characterization that makes them far more than merely exposition dumps.There's so much to admire in this film. I loved it. Moorehead and Benson are terrific talents, and I hope they are able to maintain the same level of creative ingenuity and execution as financiers discover them and give them larger bundles of cash with which to make movies.",The Endless

32,pc95,CHEAP,4,21 September 2018,"There's some times when movies can get away with low-budgets; ""The Endless"" is not one of those times.

How many times do we see drawings to somehow try to convey what ""it"" is, or become witness to effects that cause one to recall the tv shows, ""Sliders"" or ""Hercules""?

33,begob,Three Moon Junction,7,15 May 2020,"On receiving a video suggesting The Ascension has arrived at a cult they escaped from years before, two brothers return to the scene to investigate the truth ...Cult horror is not my genre, but I got into this. It's a substantial film, well performed and edited, so the pace is good. Everything tinted yellow in what looks like the scraggy location for a '70s California TV series, and an atmosphere of eerie isolation is created. Performances are good too, although the dynamic between the characters never really gets the story going - that depends on a time loop concept, with a ticking timebomb in the cycle of the weird moons.There is one well executed scene where a doomed couple - a random guy looking for his wife and a drying out addict chained to the wall - carry the exposition of the nature of the threat with good humour. But then, the story telling lets itself down with what I'd call emotional exposition plonked right into the climax as the brothers push their car away from danger while figuring out how they feel about each other.There's also a few problems, like the non-connect between the random guy and his wife, and the practicalities of the cult being trapped yet relying on the outside world. Also a reference to abuse that isn't carried through in the plot - a similar throwaway line was used in the directors' earlier movie Spring to no purpose.I definitely don't consider this horror, and I doubt it's really sci-fi either but more of a metaphysical adventure. American cults seem to stem from the problem extreme protestantism has in dealing with a reality that doesn't reflect what scripture says. In that vein, this is a thoughtful speculation on a world dominated by a higher power, where even time is a myth, and life is for preppers bewildered by the coming Apocalypse. Does it hit the right emotion? Hmmm - that end scene in the car kinda clouded it for me.Overall - big improvement on Spring, and although not a completely integrated story it got me thinking, so well worth it.",The Endless

37,gedikreverdi,Third full moon marks the ascension,8,6 August 2021,"Justin returned to The UFO death cult with his little brother Aaron because Aaron was discontent with their life outside the cult and wanted to visit. The members were pretty interesting and the actor playing Anna was amazing. She made me feel like I was seriously watching scenes from a real cult. Her ominous calmness was so palpable. And then there's her boyfriend who's doing tricks with playing cards and Hal who's trying to solve the equation written on the blackboard. There's also Tim who's brewing beer and selling it to make money for the cult. He also guarded a shed locked with a chain around it (it contained numerous recordings labeled with different years). But Jennifer was different. She was looking for her husband mike who went missing in the area. Hal promised her to help her find him. The brothers found a tape at the bottom of the lake and Justin said there was something in the lake. After watching the tape Justin wanted to leave and wandered in the area until he got lost. He ended up in a shed where a man hanging himself repeatedly. Carl the hanging guy wanted Justin to go mike and bring him a gun. Mike was the guy from the film Resolution who was trying to help his friend quit drugs. They were in another loop, too and trying to figure out how to break free. The poles were marking the borders of the loops. They set the shed on fire while Justin was leaving. The brother run into each other in the wilderness. He gave the gun to Carl. He shot himself and revived again. The guy in the tent has the shortest loop of a few seconds and it resembled of Hell the most. Then they got back to the camp and found torn clothes of the members around the bonfire. They were sucked into the sky. And then things started to explode. They drove away and seemingly managed to break free from the cycle and got back to their lives without knowing that their infinite loops were made up of ten-year periods. Seeing the two friends in that dilapidated shed and the addict cuffed to the pipe, it felt really weird because it all made sense. Although I loved Resolution without this explanation, too but it felt good to see the two. And this film drew the bigger picture and everything made sense. But I'd like see more of it and who knows perhaps they could make a third film from the same area where the three full moon in the sky meant the ascension.",The Endless

I compare ""The Endless"" to ""Annihilation"" because of its setup - something strange and unworldly is going on in one remote area of the globe. This film had a smaller budget so wasn't as pretty.

42,kuarinofu,Just drop the pretentious pseudophilosophy and its fine,7,20 October 2019,"I saw this film after watching Resolution (2012) so it was more clear to me what was going on. I'm pretty sure this would've pissed me off much more if I hadn't. Resolution (2012) was an ok experiment with zero budget that somewhat resembled an indy mystery movie (it was never a horror movie). It kind of made sense even though it had no ending at all (it just stopped). It had some flaws like amateur cinematography and weird editing but the acting and some interesting writing and dialogue were what made it work.The Endless (2017) is a follow-up to that film and while it does perform better overall it is still bloated with a lot of unnecessary content. It provides an understandable ending to the first film as well.First with the good stuff. The story is much more comprehensible this time, the relationship between the brothers is better written and at least the older brother gets a real character arc. It picks up some of the characters from the old film once again, which was nice to see. The film also has a couple of interesting ideas on what life is and what our basic lifestyle represents if you look at it from the other angle, it's cool.Now for the bad stuff though. The acting is much worse, especially when one of the directors is acting opposite to the old actors, please, let the actors act. The movie looks overedited, especially when it comes to color correction right from the start. Weird green glow-tint is just there for the looks, not necessary for anything else. The biggest problem of the film was lots of pointless hipster pseudophilosophical dialogue that meant absolutely nothing for a sane person. It was clearly in the film just to show scenes of people socializing while smartly talking about nonsense to please specific audiences who love pretentious smart talk.Other than that, it was alright. I'm glad that they found the time to revisit their old project and made it better (mostly).

47,phenomynouss,"80 minutes of nothing, 30 minutes of plot",1,21 October 2018,"I feel it is not really appropriate for people to review films where they essentially got bored and their attention wandered off. sometimes some people are just not wired to like some films.
the problem here is while I did in fact lose interest in this film, I continued to force myself to stay on to it.
First off, it takes a full 1 hour and 20 minutes for the film to get into its ""real"" plot with sci-fi/horror elements. Up until then, we are stuck with two protagonists, formerly a part of a UFO Death Cult, who inexplicably get sent a goodbye video from the cult indicating the cult is still alive. So they go back to the cult and just start squatting and paling around with their old cult friends, all while dryly navel gazing and having some of the most broad, non-specific, generalized conversations possible to convey drama without actually giving us any real substance behind it.
At no point throughout the first hour and 20 minutes do I ever figure out who these people are, what they are, why they have come back, or anything at all about this supposed cult. At no point does any of the meandering dialogue ever approach anything resembling the plot at this point. The only thing we get is that one of the two friends feels at home back in his cult, and the other one doesn't. The only thing overly unusual is the appearance of two moons in the sky, which one of them coyly responds is an atmospheric effect of some sort. It takes a full hour and 20 minutes to get that far and literally no further.
After a full hour and 20 minutes of NOTHING, the movie starts throwing baffling sequences that make no sense, random discoveries of tapes and computer harddrives, implications of a time paradox or the like, and constant mentioning of a ""loop"" which, as minutes tick past and the film rolls on, reeks copiously of Telling, and not Showing.
what basically destroys this movie is it pushes its sci-fi/horror/mystery all the way literally to the very last 30 minutes, and spends the first ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES not only never even coming close to its ""Loop"" storyline, but settling on a character story between two characters who have no personalities and literally no meaningful interactions with anyone in the entire film. Everyone acts like they never really left the cult because they are such wafer-thin non-entities that they may as well have not been in the film at all. they could easily be replaced by any random duo, even Laurel and Hardy, and have absolutely nothing meaningful change in any way.
By the time genuinely interesting head-spinning stuff starts happening, it's too late. The film has already wasted all its time and instead just taunts us with some genuinely intriguing and compelling imagery, like the fractured remnants of a far superior film that ran out of money 30 minutes in and had to be filled in with cheap, hastily written nothingness.",The Endless

I didn't check the rating until after I watched it, but had I checked before-hand, I likely would have thought this was a decent film. I did fall asleep during parts of it, so maybe I missed all the good stuff, but what I did stay awake through was very dull. On a number of occasions, you see characters give pensive looks to other characters as if something bad is going to happen to someone, and then it just moves on to another boring scene.

It is a science fiction drama with elements of mystery and suspense. You can watch it on that level, and it is entertaining, but you can also watch it as a theme and character driven story. The character development between the two brother protagonists is very good. You can pull many themes from this story: when is faith actually faith and when is it delusion (or illusion); is blood thicker than water; trust versus suspicion; honesty versus prejudice and fear; what makes a life meaningful; is there actually any such thing as control in our lives and as we try to influence the lives of others.So, in addition to being an entertaining movie it is also thought-provoking. I also am willing to give it a lot of credit for trying and in many ways succeeding to be something unique. I'm not sure they're really has been a movie quite like this one. While it isn't as heavy as Primer or Predestination, if you liked those movies this one is well worth a look.

There are indeed various camps and ashrams in those mountains.
 It makes perfect sense too, that a couple of guy who cannot find their niche in the outside world, would crave a return to such a place. What I did not understand about the plot was that besides the main people at the camp, there were peripheral characters on the outskirts who were stuck in a time loop. I don't know if each loop itself involved suicide, or if the people were committing suicide out of frustration of being stuck. There was mention that if you succumb to being stuck in the loop, you live forever, albeit in that loop.
The scenery is breathtaking. Apparently somewhere inland from San Diego.
I believe that the unknown force that people fear is either God, or their own personal limitations or fears.
Like other reviewers, I needed just a bit more character development, back story, and explanation. I don't mind being confused and coming up with my own interpretation, but it's a matter of degrees.

The actors/film-makers have made a sequel (in a trilogy?), some of whose characters are familiar from a previous film.The premise of the film is that Justin and his brother Aaron, whose life Justin runs, eke out a pretty miserable routine - or daily loop - of boring work and no relationships. When they receive a strange video tape, they return to visit a cult that rescued them as children. Strange markers that look like stony spikes mark the circumference of the cult - and of something terrifying behind it. As the brothers explore the area and forge relationships with cult members that seem not to have aged at all in 10 years, Aaron wants to stay to escape his brother's control, but Justin finds out that the markers contain 'bubbles' where time runs in a loop, some a few seconds, one (you guessed it!) 10 years. The bubbles don't repeat over and over exactly, but start with the same initial condition and end with the same final condition: death of those within when the loop restarts. In-between there is at least the appearance of free will.These bubbles were created by an entity we never get to see, but which is ever-present: in drawings by an escapee from an insane asylum; in ancient Native American monoliths (so it's been around for a long time!); in equations written out by the physicist-leader of the cult (who claims there is no leader). The entity is the audience for the sad shows put on by the unfortunate bubble prisoners, and goads them along with movies, photos and sound recordings that fall from the sky or emerge from the lake.The movie gets 7/10, even though production values are low-budget and the acting varies in quality, for several reasons: it keeps the audience on its toes; it spends a lot of time on good character development, including the brother's ambiguous relationship, but also with cult members and a few others trapped in time bubbles; it can be seen again, and hints in various parts of the movie will become apparent on second viewing; it bucks the annoying trend of constant action without reflection in most current movies. (Well, OK, it's an indie film, so it better!)Also, I usually find electronic scores annoying, but this one is subdued and menacing at the same time, and should hold up pretty well.I hear there will be a 'part 3' at some point, and look forward to it with interest. I do hope the auteurs stay away from a banal revelation like the spider creature at the end of 'It,' or the human batteries in 'The Matrix.'",The Endless

It's not your average jump scare horror flick as it relies on building up a creepy atmosphere and using more common scare tactics sparesley. A follow-up on ""Resolution"", Benson and Moorhead's ""The Endless"" is a part of a wider mythology created by them, which, even though this film answers some questions, still leaves you with many unanswered. The idea that the main characters - Justin and Aaron - might actually be inside a larger time loop themselves is a truly thrilling thought and that is something that this film gives you a lot of.

None of the characters carry any of the scenes. All the dialog is spoken in a sort of David lynch twin peaks manner, all monotone and just moving the story forward. Very rarely do you feel any genuine emotion from the cast.That said the movie is weird and interesting. Two brothers who ran away from a supposed death cult and live a poverty stricken lifestyle decide to go back to the cult, which for reasons unknown never actually finalized their end, to give the younger brother some closure.As the days pass tension mounts and the brothers begin to think the supernatural is majorly at play and things get...crazy.The movie provides finite closure to ""Resolution"", the writers previous movie which ended on an insane Cabin in the Woods-esque cliff hanger.

When I saw their first great film; ""Resolution"" a few years back, I was absolutely blown away by its unique and foreboding nature, and I was constantly wondering about the ambiguous yet fantastic ending it left us with.

Its imagination and creative unraveling of a insanely brilliant and mysterious tale is incredibly intriguing. The visuals and set pieces are astoundingly well done and set such a clever tone that's doused in suspense and wonder throughout. It's abundantly clear these guys can make amazing films on lower humble budgets and it speaks volumes about their talent as writers/filmmakers.

I understand the limitations of working with a low budget, and they did a fairly good job of just making a coherent story. I've seen many low budget features and shorts that weren't even coherent, let alone good. I just don't like its imbalanced tone and story. My main problem: when Justin Benson's character threw down verbally against the cult leader there should have been a tonal change with him that lasted for the remainder of the film. No one would have such an epiphany and verbally blow up at someone about the horrible conditions in that place then just lollygag through the remainder of his escape. Just moments after he decided that he wanted to leave he seemed as indifferent and lethargic as he seemed during the beginning of the film. There was no sense of urgency or anger or even panic in his acting-- normal things that one would expect in those conditions. It might have been a limitation of him directing himself.
Aaron Moorehead's performance as his brother was almost as uneven. They seemed to play basically the same people from the start of the film to its ending. I misinterpreted their natural performances at the beginning of the film as the signs of good actors. No.

I can't go much further without spoilers.It eschews a lot of the standard tropes of modern horror and sci-fi movies. That's probably at least partially because it didn't have the budget, but I was happy for once not to see someone's eyes turn white, their face distort into a weird shape, their body bend backwards, etc. There were no pop scares or repulsive CGI. It was really a 70s-style slow burn, in which you really had no idea where it was headed until very near the end.It's not perfect. If you start looking closely, there are some things that don't make sense within the logic of the movie, and the end gets a little....busy.

Implying that a person possesses a negative state of mind if they don't like the film (or a positive state of mind if they do like the film) is akin to bullying someone into believing that the score the person gives the movie is based on the actual movie, and simply not the reviewer's (if you can call them that) desire to illegitimately inflate the movie's success (or lack thereof).That being said... I give this movie a 6.5/10 because it constantly ties itself together. Aspects of the beginning of the film are tied to the end, aspects of the end of the film are tied back to the beginning. All throughout the movie (if you paid attention) you will recognize things and have ""aha!"" moments. Though those aha moments are not all that amazing, they are interesting nevertheless. The main characters' acting is a little bland and emotionless, but I guess the directors wanted to make sure that the movie turned out the way they wanted it to. Some of the other actors (the various men in cabins/houses) showcased good acting skills. I would have given this a 6/10 but after realizing that the subplot in the detox house is tied back to the movie ""Resolution"" I had to up the score to a 6.5/10. The visual effects are very good except for the end.... are we not past the days of ""day for night"" cinematic effects? Invest in good lighting or simply film it during dawn/dusk. STOP pretending that it is nighttime when obvious shadows are projected onto everything from a sun that is in the middle of the sky. It doesn't look like a moon! ESPECIALLY when the cameraman has already zoomed in on the nighttime sky and showed a moon (or two). This could have been a 7/10 with a boost in funding for camera lighting and better actors for the lead roles of the brothers. The movie could have been even better with better effects and soundtrack (and the music was very good, but the soundtrack simply didn't exist during some parts). I mean, in all honesty, this script is an 8/10 (i.e. Predestination) but the budget just didn't call for that good of a movie. This movie falls in that category of GREAT stories with GOOD executions (i.e. Primer).This writer Justin Benson has some really good ideas. 10 years from now he could really do something big.

99,captainpass,Thoughtful Slow Burn,7,20 November 2021,"I didn't realize when I first sat down to watch this one that this was from the same hands as ""Resolution"" and ""Spring."" As in those films, character dialogue is particularly important (which set Benson and Moorhead apart from most contemporary horror film-makers). The dialogue style of the characters-- short bursts of often esoteric or sarcastic assertions -- is definitely close to that used in the earlier movies, with this difference: this film features multiple narratives and a much larger cast. Thus, the task of ""bringing it all together"" is much more difficult. Did they succeed?Mostly. At first, what was personal and believable between the main characters in ""Spring' and ""Resolution"" was not terribly believable here: the whole idea of a ensemble of contemporary-clad 20 and 30-somethings in the forests of SoCal drinking beer, smoking what-not and being part of some ill defined cult. I was all-too-conscious of the artifice at times for the first thirty minutes or so. Frankly, it was all a bit stiff and wooden for me.But, as in ""Spring"" and ""Resolution,"" the directors hold their ""weird cards"" for the second half. Thus, what begins as a bit of a clumsy slow burn becomes far more focused (yet also more surreal/psychological or ""Lynchian"") as the movie progresses. With the benefit of hindsight, then, the dialogue actually works as a reasonable means to a good end. (As an aside: The integration of certain ""Resolution"" scenes into this film is really rather clever.)I would compare ""The Endless"" to ""Equinox"" (1970), ""The Axiom"" (2018) or even ""Braid"" [""Dying to Play""] (2018)"" to analogize its mood and working premises. And like ""Braid,"" there are some superior themes at work here that, while never fully un-spooled, give the viewer a great deal to think about: repetition vs salvation, the novelty of danger/addiction vs. The tedium of stability, group acceptance vs. Social death, the desire for both a home and a new start.I think a tighter script might have helped.

One plot line I would like to have seen explored more fully was why the two brothers were living such unfulfilled and disappointing lives, and why they were living them together.

Jason Benson deserves praise for an intelligent, thoughtful script with some fine dialogue. It's well directed, decently shot and uses its few locations extremely well.

While the protagonists are to root for - and even the side characters are good (enough) - the story feels all over the place.I never felt the presence of ""something bigger, more powerful.."" - all what happened felt rather random and underwhelming.I would have loved to know more about the people and their stories. The actual story of the movie was so straight forward that it was predictable and boring.

Instead they decide to be the two main characters and wow are they about as boring and dull as you can get. No emotional range, no acting skill at all. You would think saving all that money not having to hire any leads they could at least make the small bit actors decent. But no you get more cookie cuter people they found in the woods to act.One guy was so bad he somehow managed to make walking fast on the side of the road look so fake and bad I almost turned it off right then and there. But I struggled for another half hour of a pattern of a strange scene, followed by the two Generic robot leads discussing it slowly badly and boringly. They can't act, they have no clue how to direct or any clue as to pacing, and they hire even worse actors then them. Why it takes two people to direct something this bad is beyond me.I can deal with low budget movies but when the 2 lead actors are also the directors and writers and they woodenly slog through their scenes with the emotional range of a mental patient on Thorazine that's when I pull the plug. Your not watching a movie anymore, your a teacher suffering through a first year film students trash.Anyone can use Lovecraftian horror and mood to try and make a movie but you need actors, directing and a budget to make it watchable.Do yourself a favor and watch Lovecraft atmosphere and dread done 100x better and watch Annihilation.

This is a film I had been excited to see for a while, and my god it did not disappoint. The Endless is about two brothers who escaped a ""UFO death cult"" 10 years prior to the start of the movie, and follows them when they decide to revisit the cult, slowly realizing that there may be more truth to what these fanatics worship than they originally thought. The writing is amazing, the best I have seen in quite a while. Constantly teasing you and pulling you along through this mysterious and captivating story. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time, I was intrigued and fascinated, in constant awe and fear of what it could all be leading up to. The whole movie was just absolutely riveting. There aren't even any specifically suspenseful scenes, the entire film is just suspense and mystery throughout. The characters are all very interesting and for how many characters there are, they do a great job quickly developing who they are and making you remember them. This film is extremely creative and original; the concept that the whole movie leads up to is terrifying. The cinematography and directing are all great and only further immersed me. My only wish is that it had a higher budget, some things had to be shown off screen and some effects didn't look too great, but they did a lot with what they had, especially for how ambitious this film was. I would have loved to have seen what some of this could have looked like if they had just a bit more $ to throw at it. That being said, there were also some great effects, especially towards the finale, you can tell that was where most of it went. There were also some great and creepy effects just pulled off by some masterful editing, and those shots were some of the coolest. In conclusion, The Endless is amazing and absolutely mind bending, a perfect little sci-fi/horror indie film that will have you and your friends discussing it long after it ends.",The Endless
134,cavemould,great movie!,8,13 July 2020,"A great movie, and on a low budget too. Quite a unique twist because although the main characters are all on a loop, they are apparently also aware that they are in a loop, but don't know much more beyond that. It seems each time they are reset, they grow a little bit more while not realising where the loop starts exactly. The visual distortions like the multiple moons etc, and the way people just accept what's going on just add to the psychedelic mystery of it all.The entity is completely unexplained. Perhaps it is a supernatural force, or an alien, or something that simply defies science and knowledge. It is watching everyone, and has total mastery of time and space within the region around the lake where I assume it lives. Because it is so mysterious and unknown, its motivations are very difficult to ascertain, leaving all the protagonists to make their own speculation about it. Some just act out of defiance, others acceptance, others persevere, others focus on just one thing.... its like every character is being tested to their limits to see how each one reacts, almost like lab animals in a skinner box.for what purpose the entity does this is a mystery, perhaps for its own entertainment, or perhaps because it is curious to push people to the limits. Maybe this is just the way a multi-dimensional invisible entity interacts with humans. A bit like the way the Solaris planet interacted with the human crew in orbit, completely bizarre and alien. It's never really explained, which leaves the viewer to make up their own conclusions and that makes this movie worth an extra watch.",The Endless

They've done everything on their own terms and educated themselves on how to tell a story well. I hope they maintain their high level of integrity and continue to do their own thing. It's obvious that they've learned a lot since their first film resolution, and watching endless it's awesome that they've tied this film so closely with it, and it really helps to explain those characters. It's littered with references to resolution and it's definitely worth watching that film first. It's not fancy, it's just funny, odd and weird. It's obvious that these guys have studied lovecraft who was a visceral and acerbic author who told remarkable stories. I really hope they continue to expand this story as there are some loops I would like to know more about, like the ten second man. I want to know how he ended up that way and if he ever gets free. There are few films with much bigger budgets, that leave me thinking about it days after. It was easy to connect with the characters and isn't that what a great story teller does? The effects were really subtle but very well done, not for the sake of it, just when it was needed.

And the mechanic itself doesn't give you a meaningful message or something, it's just what's happening, so it didn't feel deep or that it was going somewhere or let me wonder about higher powers (like The Void did) since what's happening is confined to that camp/area in the desert.

152,vonna-05624,A treat for the sci fi lover,8,13 February 2020,"I write this review not having see Resolution or Spring or really anything else by these film makers. I was blown away. I am not surprised that they won a number of awards for this film. I loved it. It was not without its problems of course, but overall the story/concept was intriguing. The acting was really good. Honestly, I was quite surprised at how good the filmmakers acting was. If you are a sci fi lover, then watch this film. It makes you think....I actually had a nightmare about it (in a ""good""way). So it has the mind bending aspect but also the thriller aspect to it. Very appealing. Now for some spoilers and issues.So, we learn as we watch that the ""cult"" and others in the area, that they are stuck in a time loop - that some sort of power or alien/diety sort of thing is controlling it. And in some cases, he is cruel (and we don't know why) and in other cases not so cruel, but still disturbing. The cult has to live over and over again within this time loop, never aging, never changing, never able to leave.
Issues - How did these men, when they were boys leave the ""cult?"" There was some dialogue regarding age and being able to see or feel the diety....does this mean they weren't affected as kids? Is this why they were allowed to leave 10 years before? Why didn't these guys realize something else was going on when the people in the cult didn't age? Aarron and Justin weren't young enough to play ""boys"" 10 years old too. Took some imagination and thoughts that Justin was just going gray early. ................Also, the leader/not leader guy (Hal) says that they make beer and that is their livelihood and that a couple is the one who grew the barley. Well how, if they are stuck in a loop, able to grow barley, harvest it, process it, and ferment beer in that time. Also the leader/not leader gets angry with the Aaron and Justin for the lies Justin tells about the ""cult"", saying that it ruins their livelihood of selling beer....well how in the bleep are they selling beer to the outside world? no one can leave, right? so are they saying that people come there, buy their beer, then leave? it doesn't make sense. It's not logical and has too many unanswered questions. There are also unanswered questions with how long they were there? how did they age in a time loop as boys? They were pulled out of a burning crash (mother died - was she in the cult or leaving the cult or just a traveler?). Again, how did Justin get them out of that cult? How did they not know about this evil deity? Did they not see and were they not part of the time loop? had they never explored the area as kids? Did they never see the totem poles? And WHY did the leader/Hal tell Justin to go to the bottom of the lake? Why didn't anyone in the cult WARN them about what was really going on? Why didn't the lady with the missing husband say WHY they couldn't look for her husband? So many questions.....as others have said. But OVERALL, a really interesting, thought provoking story which was well filmed and acted. Definitely worth your time and attention. These guys remind me a bit of my favorite film maker. M. Knight....and I look forward to seeing more of their stuff. I will be looking at their previous work as well. Watch the film, enjoy it, and let your imagination run wild.",The Endless

The story is brilliant - not your usual Hollywood flash, bang and clever talk entertainment. This movie had depth to it, the story reflecting the relationship between the main protagonists. What motivates us to mislead other people? It isn't always for our own gain, but often to protect the other person, the problem being removing choice from the other person.
****SPOILER ALERT*****
The time loops in the cult reflect the loop of the main characters' relationship to each other.

155,spidermonkeycoleman,"A satisfying follow-up to Resolution, but it does need a little work",6,1 November 2021,"I'll be brief as I can with this but this is a type of movie that isn't for everyone.The biggest flaw I can think of is the plot. The plot is good, but it takes a bit longer to get somewhere than it should've. The 2nd half of the movie is great, but in order for the audience to see that, you need the viewer to be able to make it through the first half as well which not everyone will want to do. Not much happens in the 1st half and that might draw some viewers away. Like I said though, great 2nd half.The acting wasn't awful but it wasn't good either. Some of it was stale while some of it worked well. However, the acting was good when it needed to be and that's what matters most.It also doesn't explain what's going on very well which causes a bit of confusion. You get some answers but also get more questions. But maybe that's what Justin and Aaron were going for with this, maybe there will be another film to further explain this story, but who knows?Not a bad movie but not one of Justin and Aaron's best. Average acting with an interesting, but confusing, story and a plot that drags before it begins to pick itself up.",The Endless

161,augustkellerwrites,Niche Following Potential,7,4 June 2018,"The Endless is a film that is easy to get pulled into due to the variety of its techniques and the intention of its direction. A daunting atmosphere is created almost instantly with ominous scoring and dramatic transitions from scene to scene. Tensions rise as the plot carefully creeps along and the cast is given room to hit notes as diverse as comedic and horrifying. However, while the craft of this movie may be clear, the drawbacks are clear as well.Some jokes fall flat, some characters feel incomplete, and some effects look weak. The Endless gives so many gifts but, unfortunately, it delivers some misses as well. Lightly peppered throughout the existential themes and sprawling imagery are cheesy lines and forced plot points, which leaves the whole thing feeling like a slightly missed opportunity. Superb sound, pacing and direction make The Endless a fascinating film from the drop but it all comes with enough miscalculations that the tonal integrity may be questioned by some. The result is a film that has potential to form a niche following but receive some mixed reviews from the general public.Writing: 7/10

It was a mess. I hated that film...And then I hear about The Endless, that's allegedly a new revolutionary horror movie and what not... I gave it a chance, full of hype hoping to see some Sci-Fi horror movie, because I did not want to watch the trailer to not spoil anything So I went in completely blind. I did not know the movies were even connected, and after finishing watching The Endless, it sucked, I hated it. After reading some reviews later I learned the two movies are actually connected... So my taste just confirmed to me on two separate occasions that both movies are awful.",The Endless
163,abs-ghosh,Its a direct sequel to Resolution...,7,24 December 2018,"I watched this movie first, it hurt my brain quite a bit. Somewhere on the discussion board someone mentioned that its linked to Resolution but only mildly. I decided to watch Resolution and there was nothing mild about their link, The Endless might as well be a sequel. Its just told from a different perspective than Resolution but has way too many nods to Resolution to just be a cheeky nod. Just a friendly warning, Resolution is very heavy on the relation ship between two best friends than it is on the scifi mystery its labeled under.As a whole its a pretty interesting movie to watch and will likely keep you asking questions, most of them feel like the answers might be a simple goof or logic error rather than a cleverly set up Nolan-esque intrigue.

Basically, I think it's a pre/sequel to ""Resolution"". Needless to say, that I would have preferred to see this first and then the loop inside Resolution, it would have explained the framework better (but I will rewatch Resolution asap).Back to ""The Endless"" ... I find it fascinating, both in terms of the script & direction and also in terms of visuals and sound. This is actually a great accomplishment considering the fact that it's a low budget independent film, like the other two movies they directed. Although the plot may not sound so exciting and original at first, rest assured that it is. Also, the many subtle symbolic references to today's ""unauthentic"" society add a lot to the general impression.
It deals also with the decision of living a secure but repetitive life instead of a risky but free one.It's hard to review it properly without giving too much of the plot away, or includ minor spoilers.Highly recommended to people who love independent, anti mainstream movies.",The Endless

The storyline was a nice surprise-not what I was expecting and quite original and the sound track was equally fitting.

The acting is kind of average but it never gets so bad it pulls you out of the film.
The mood is really faithfull to the lovecraft vibe, that's why i gave this film an extra point. Seldom do filmmakers manage to achieve that.
The whole film doesn't feel exactly ""pro"", you can tell the filmakers don't have a lot of experience in filmaking.
Nevertheless, the mood is so well done you forgive them, they totally nailed the lovecraftian feel.A little amateurish but a good film nonetheless, with pretty good visual ideas, a lot of original ideas you never saw elsewhere before and a nice build up of tension. lovecraft fans will not be disappointed.",The Endless

Husband fell asleep pretty quickly but don't read a lot into that: he falls asleep during loud war scenes at the movie theater, too. I thought that Jason and Aaron did a decent job of acting---better than I could do, for sure. Just some holes in the plot that maybe other viewers could fill but I couldn't. I guess I like things nice and neat at the end. Example: these boys grew up there, at this commune that is in an endless loop. While they were visiting, the time frame that they had until they were caught in a loop and would never be able to leave was when those three moons were full. So, why weren't they ever caught in a loop when they were living there for years??? Another: they knew they only had a day before the moons were full. Why weren't they hurrying the hell up? Food: where were the groceries coming from? Did the Deity allow them off the commune to go to the market? What did Justin see at the bottom of the lake? He looked terrified when he came up. He's not going to look that way because he saw a metal box, so what was down there? When Justin went to the Gun Tweaker's cabin and saw Mike there, why didn't he say to Mike immediately upon realizing who he was, ""Hey! Your wife is looking for you! She's staying at the commune hoping to find you!."" If the Deity allows them off the grounds to go to the market and to sell their beer, won't he let Mike hike up the hill a bit to see his wife? Were all the loops different lengths? Why did some have long ones and some have shorter ones? And more questions that I can't think of right now.

The worst part of the ending is that there could have been a tie in to the beginning of the movie where upon receiving a tape, launched them into the need to visit the camp. Not eluding to if their reality was just another loop of a grander scale was the biggest letdown of all. If you're going to pick up Lovecraftian horror, have some sense of the bleak cosmic nature of it and blunt that somewhat happy ending where these two morons go back to their horrible existence.All and all, was watchable when on quarantine but could have really elevated itself with the richness of the source material.",The Endless

214,ariwebbkatanos,The Endless by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead,6,4 April 2018,"What to say about this film? It wasn't what I intended to see when I traveled to the cinemas last month, but it's what I got. I don't have much to say about the actors, or directors, nor their previous films. I simply walked into this movie blind. It's from this perspective that I'll put together my short review. The Endless is a film about time, life and consequences, coupled with supernatural themes and elements.The Endless starts out poorly and awkwardly with obvious low production value, stale acting and a weirdly present shaky cam. The poor impression this put on me harmed the film in the short term, but actually left a lot of room for it to move upwards, and that it did. The film itself decently improves once the plot moves from the characters normal lives and into the isolated country area where the rest of the movie takes place.The plot itself is the movies strongest suit, but that isn't saying much. It delivers decently on tense moments, interesting characters and creative concepts. Throughout the film I had to remain on my toes to stay on top of some of its more convoluted elements, which I'm going to put into the negative category. I honestly believe a film's plot should at least on a surface level be completely graspable in a first watch, with still plenty of underlying points and themes waiting to be discovered later.By and large the film didn't capture my attention for very long and its even taken me a while to get around to writing this review. In summary, the film keeps itself moving on its good pacing and plot, but is constantly brought down by over-complicated elements and stale acting. I had originally considered a 7 out of 10 for the film, but on revision I think I will leave it with a 6.",The Endless

216,squareyourface,Don't try to convince me this movie makes sense,5,25 February 2021,"The acting was ok. The writing was ok. The idea is kinda neat. But the lack of internal consistency and explanation...frustrated me. Some examples:
When the loop resets for the gun nut tweaker, his previous body is still there? Why isn't his body there from every loop? Shouldn't there be hundreds of corpses? Why aren't anyone else's bodies there from their previous loops?Do people have an awareness of their loop? The cult people seem to. The gun nut tweaker does. But the protagonists don't seem to, despite clues that they are looping. The handcuffed drug addict and his friend talk about knowing about their loop, and yet, when it resets, they seem to carry on repeating their previous loop like their memory has been reset. The guy in the tent with a 10 second loop speaks like he knows he's looping but acts like he doesn't by doing the exact same thing every time. I don't understand the rules.So the monster in the sky has complete control of time, and is omnipresent, but it can only communicate by taking pictures on a polaroid camera?! And why does it leave media in such random locations? Sometimes it's mailed to you, sometimes dropped at your feet, and sometimes delivered to the bottom of a lake. What?Why is the cult so secretive about information regarding their loop while people in other loops aren't secretive about it? They come right out and say it. It seems like they're in a predicament, and they would want to explain it to others and ask for help.And what is the sky monster that controls time? Oh sorry, not only can it communicate by taking polaroid pictures, but it can play tug of war. And you know it doesn't like you if it tugs real hard.What are the clumpy, gnarled sticks? I get that they are somehow a sign of the presence of the monster...but what else? Sometimes you can walk next to one and walk through a loop boundary, but other times you walk next to one and nothing happens.When a loop resets, what happens to the sun, to daylight, to things outside your loop boundary that can still affect you? When your 3 hour loop resets, does the position of the sun also reset, or does it continue from where it was at the end of your previous loop?How do you escape your loop? Or alternatively, what is keeping people in their loop? The protagonists just have to drive outside it and then apparently they're free. Why doesn't everyone just do that?What do the swirling birds in the sky have to do with anything?I have so many more questions, but I won't ramble any further.",The Endless

You'll have to keep paying attention to get the edges.The ending explains the story of the cult without spelling everything out, and it leaves you wondering how the situation developed and who, or what, is responsible.

232,toenailzits,The major flaw that broke the movie,4,29 October 2019,"After watching this movie I really enjoyed the acting and the story building. I'd like how they gave you little pieces throughout the movie until they finally did the reveal of what was going on halfway through the movie.
Everyone in the forest is apparently stuck in different time loops in the characters are very self-aware of this because they are the ones that explain it to the 2 guys that return to the UFO cult. Apparently the time Loop is for the amusement of some invisible creature you never see that rules the forest. And what they're told us as the Story Goes On is that if they don't get out of there by the time the third move is complete they will be stuck in the time loop with the rest of them and never be able to leave and never be able to die. But there in lies the problem unless I miss something in the movie which I don't think I did they apparently were in The Cult when they were younger in fact when the movie begins before they go back to the cult with one of the brothers talking about how much he was missing the camaraderie and the good food they used to give them in the cult. In fact he was the one that talked his brother into going back. From the backstory you get the idea that they had lived there a while before leaving. And the reason why I'm saying all this is because this is where the story falls apart because when it's revealed to them that they need to be out of there before the third moon or else be stuck in the time Loop forever that doesn't make sense because if they live there for a while 10 years prior to coming back and visiting by the rules of the movie they should already be stuck in the time Loop because they already spent enough time in the forest to make that happen. That is why the story doesn't work because it doesn't follow its own rules. That is why when I finish the movie I thought the ending was going to be only the forest making it look like they got out( because it's also explained in the movie that the monster in the forest has the ability to change and add things to the forest and try to keep people lost in it so they get stuck in the time Loop.) but they too were stuck in a Time Loop of their own that they were unaware of. But the ending is them breaking out just before reset of the forest caught up to them. Which does not make sense given the other rules of the story because they should be stuck in the time Loop just like everybody else because of the amount of time they where there before. Also usually people stuck in a Time Loop are not self-aware of the time at least in other time Loop stories because it would be like hitting reset on a video game none of the characters in the video game are aware of the fact that they've just been reset. But that's kind of a side issue compared to the major flaw in the story. Which is they should be stuck in the time loop with everybody because of how long they lived there before their return at the start of the movie.",The Endless
233,anilaloshi,I liked it,8,22 October 2021,"This is a great film with an interesting concept. It's quite gripping. Good for fans of cosmic horror, sci-fi, psychological and supernatural films. It takes the idea of a UFO cult and takes it in a completely unexpected direction. It's creepy and unsettling without needing to rely on tons of gore, shock and special effects - one of the main strengths of the movie is that it leaves certain things to the imagination (especially the more gory elements). The two brothers have a really interesting dynamic. However, i did find that there were some parts that dragged on a little, and imo it would've been better if there were more weird events that were creepier leading up to the ending.",The Endless

Anyway the story is indeed really interesting, character construction is well achieved and cast performances are good.The special thing on this film is the unique kind of horror it depicts, not your usual killer monster to run from but a locraftian cosmic horror where humans are tiny insignificant beings in a big universe. The great psychological horror on the film is also an important point. Human issues and human interaction, escaping from the past, trust other persons, connecting with people, belonging to a place, being in control of life and destiny are topics present.In the movie not all important answers are given to the viewer but the story definitely is a nice and satisfying ride.

If you read Adolfo Bioy Casares' novella La invención de Morel (1940) you will have a sense of déjà-vu as you encounter the characters and the time loops that some of them try to break free of. Unlike the novella, though, in which characters are brough to life through the mediation of a projector, the film uses the mediation of an explainable force, worshiped by most of the cult members, to re-enact and re-experience a most horrible death. It mostly all happens off camera, but the soundscape, cryptic dialogues, flawless camera work, and the wandering gazes and desires of the brothers allow you to get into this puzzling world of 'the fantastic,' a hesitation felt both by characters and spectators, as explained by Tzvetan Todorov. The unsaturated palette and eery atmosphere makes you think of series like The Twilight Zone and Lost, and Isaac Ezban's The Incident (2012).

264,ray-06990,Answered Questions,9,31 May 2020,"This movie in one word: thoughtful.Each detail of the movie, every conversation, has hints and meaning laced into it. I'm convinced any questions you have are answered somewhere in the movie. There may not be a monolog at the end to explain it to you, and that's part of the beauty. You get to discover the answers yourself. Or from me, if you read ahead.Spoilers follow.My interpretation of the ending:The two brothers have been stuck in the loop. A 10 year + long loop. But in this loop, the one we witness, they break free. They have finally discovered the ending that the entity in the sky wanted to see.Evidence:1. Pedophile:
Anna and Aaron have a flirtatious undertone throughout the movie. Justin tells Aaron at one point that Anna would ""make eyes"" at Aaron as a child, and he then goes on to call her a pedophile.Is this scene just pointless banter between brothers? No. This is a clue. Why would Anna make eyes at Aaron as a child? Not because she was a pedophile, but because she had been with him in a prior loop as an adult.2. The gun nut tweaker painting:
Lizzy, the escaped mental health patient, is painting a picture of a man holding his arms out toward either side, guns in hand. She calls him the gun nut tweaker. She used to watch him on her trips from the psych ward.We initially think the gun nut tweaker is the drug addict that Mike is trying to get sober. But after Justin delivers the gun for the angry 3 hour loop man, we see him replicate this exact picture. The angry man has his arms out, gun in one hand, his fingers in the shape of a gun on the other, before he kills himself.How would Lizzy have painted this picture? How would she have seen this scene? She can't tell the future, the only way she would know that image is if she had seen it in the past. And the only way that would have happened in the past is if this was not Justin's first time bringing him a gun, and thus not his first loop.3. The projection screen:
After Justin and Aaron meet at the trailer, they walk off. The camera pans to a projection screen that shows them walking off, and then shows it again, and again. I believe this is showing their prior loops, the multiple times they have repeated the same actions.4. Car battery / camcorder:
In order for Aaron and Justin to die in their loop, they had to return to it. They receive a video from the cult, that no one seems to have sent. This leads me to believe that the thing in the sky is the one who sent it, calling them back to complete their loop. Even when outside the camp, they were making decisions that would get them back there. Aaron was supposed to buy a car battery, but instead bought a camcorder. A camcorder that allowed him to watch the video, the video that brought them back to the camp. He did not buy the battery, because a battery would have made it easy for Justin to leave when he was ""thrown out"". If he had left, he would not have completed his loop.5. ""All I ever wanted""
Justin likes to call the shots. From the beginning to the end Aaron complained about how he never lets him make any decisions, how he controls their life. When Aaron says he wants to stay and Justin says okay, he's taken aback. They decide to leave together. Justin finally lets Aaron drive. ""All I ever wanted was to screw up alongside you"". And this time, they escape. I believe this small decision to let Aaron call the shots and take control is what made them able to escape their loop. It was the ending the entity in the sky wanted to see.I believe all the characters can escape. It's just a matter of not time, but action. That's why Hal told the woman they would find her husband, it just might take a very long time... Hal himself is trying to escape by figuring out the equation.When everyone sees that Justin and Aaron have finally escaped, they all smile, albeit somewhat sadly. They are happy for them, it probably gives them hope that someday they may too escape. But it is also sad, because they will never see their friends again -- friends they have known loop after loop after loop.",The Endless

Details like why they want to go there and why vegetables don't grow in the ""real"" world (for instance) are conveniently missed out. Once they reach there, the story gets stuck in monotony and doesn't really go anywhere until the last 10 minutes. Very disappointed with everything about this movie.",The Endless

Ingredients: A little sprinkle of the feeling you get if you attend too many festivals, a mysterious and unseen alien (or maybe not alien) prescence, much weirdness, questions of time, space and life itself, and time again.

273,congect,I don't get it,1,4 October 2020,"I've literally seen hundreds of sci-fi movies; I love them. In fact, I love them so much, I often really enjoy many that receive mediocre reviews (and, in some instances, even bad reviews). This doesn't make me an expert on sci-fi but I just don't get the high-praise reviews and Metacritic score (the reasons I chose to watch this movie). Even the Rotten Tomatoes audience rating of 67% is shockingly high to me.Yes, this movie is original. Yes, the acting is decent; but even amazing acting can't save a bad story, and this movie has a very bad story.This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A stupid plot, stupid characters (as written, not how they were acted), and I didn't particularly care for the director's choice of color scheme which I felt made it difficult to watch (though I understand the point of it/them). I can't describe why I disliked this movie so much without going through the entire plot, but I thought it was terrible. The only sci-fi element I felt intriguing (the fact that everyone was in their own time loop AND aware of it) sadly played part in an otherwise completely unwatchable move.This was the second time I finished a movie and just went, 'WTF did I just watch?!?!?' and 'How did I make it all the way through that movie?' (the first being Napoleon Dynamite). I may not have the best taste in movies, and I'll certainly never make a career as a movie critic, but this was one of the VERY few movies of which I had to write a review.",The Endless

So many movies are just like other movies. Like in horror - a group of teens have to stay in a haunted house/Asylum or whatever over night.

280,askanade,Different and interesting,7,19 September 2018,"There are no cut and dried answers here, just a mystery and a happening that defies logic but makes you feel that it just might happen somewhere unknown to anyone. What is really happening at this cult, why are some people behaving so strangely, what is the past that has pulled the two brothers back to make sense of it all.I liked the movie, the acting and the flow is good and the tempo maintained till the end. The theme of living life in a loop where one day is very much like the other is intriguing but the possibility that some alien intelligence is making it happen leaving no way to escape such a fate seems a little depressing.But finally it is a different movie, well made and so different than the standard SciFi genre that it is worth a watch.",The Endless

The premise where the main characters would go back to ""a cult"", and the poor memory of events, given that it wasn't all that long ago were drastically unbelievable.

The film is made with the look and feel of a Hollywood budget, which should be celebrated and the performances are earnest if not spectacular. The narrative winds through its 1hr 51min runtime, not culminating in a big reveal, but rather allowing the viewer to unpick the dilemma that will face the main protagonists at their own pace. Nothing is spelt out to the viewer and, at times, the dialogue is so intangible it becomes meaningless.

Good performances from most of the actors too which helps the film greatly.The film unfortunately suffers from some pacing issues. We dive in to the main action of the film pretty quickly however once the plot is set in to action it almost feels as if it doesn't know where to go. I can appreciate slow cinema however this film felt more like directionless cinema. Some interesting concepts at play throughout the film but sadly not executed in the best way.Would recommend to fans of sci-if thrillers.For fans of: Coherence (2013), Sound of My Voice (2011), Primer (2004).",The Endless

 - If they were in a loop why the need to sell beer? There was about 5 days between the tape and the end of the loop, so 1 week maybe?
 - Why was the guy on the 5s loop tent made like he was from early 1900s if they would still age, even if slower? Also, he had no time to kill himself before ""it"" got to him.
 - Why would they ask people to stay when they werent trying to end the cycle like the others?

I'm not a horror fan, but a huge thriller buff and I appreciate tension, build, mystery, more tension, some nail biting, tossing in questioning of reality, and deeper meaning layered into the context.
Yeah, some of the free-will questions are spoon-fed, but there are other western family/religion and political ideals being questioned as well.
There is one quote in the film that really put the entire thing in a nutshell, but I don't want to give anything away.
It got incredibly high rating everywhere I've looked except IMDb, so was suprised at 6.5 here. I assume its from people expecting a horror and being given a Sci-fi philosophical thriller and being miffed about it.",The Endless

Another thing about their films, especially this one, is that their characters react to the world and each other like real people; skeptics don't act stupid in the face of weirdness, friends banter like friends, etc.

Lovecraft. In The Endless, two brother who recently escape from a cult receive a mysterious tape from said group, inciting them to journey back to the secluded and mysterious Camp Arcadia. Without giving too much away, suffice to say there is something very, very wrong on the campgrounds, something that desires to toy with the populace of Camp Arcadia as well as others unfortunate enough to be caught in its grasp. The acting is a bit stale in some scenes, however, the brothers (acted by directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead) manage to convincingly portray the ups and downs of a familial relationship in a time of hardship in a manner both brilliant and natural. The effects are well used and sparingly implemented, giving shape but no form to the forces at work throughout the film, although one could easily be very nauseating for those suffering from motion sickness. While the comedic elements usually fall somewhat flat, the atmosphere and brilliant concepts at play make this a must watch for horror enthusiasts and Lovecraft fans alike, as well as those interested in unique or experimental film techniques.

It's about potentially extra terrestrial occurences and sci-fi mind games. I saw many people who reviewed this movie have no clue. They haven't seen Resolution, therefore not making the proper correlations. Even by itself though, the film stands well on its own 2 legs. It's entertaining, suspenseful, has bits of comedy, a good story and leaves room for the imagination. Now, put it with Resolution (an underappreciated movie that sadly isn't as well known as it should be), and the movie takes on wings. Watch both for so many reasons. It's a great story that slowly develops into way more than what it seems. If you don't like it...you're not doing it right. Only complaint is some less than perfect acting (inexperienced or just a little bland seeming). The flavorless acting at times may very well be intentional though to portray the characters as regular dudes. They don't need to be extremely emotional. Next time I watch I will decide how I feel about that. All in all, worth watching more than once.",The Endless
