0,ops-52535,its full of great efforts,8,16 March 2020,"This is not a traditional comedy, nor is it a blackcomedy either, its somwehere inbetween.... its a description of a young mans life and speedway to adulthood, the immaturity told in a mature manner, and the acting by the main cast is just darn good. its not full of action, just a lifesaver to all youth at the brink, and all young parents looking for signs so that they can make their traps and eventually punish their loved ones for their bad moves.the rather immature grumpy old man found this very heartwarming, ive experienced some of the things myself, so its a good choice for everyone above age of 12. its a recommend",Big Time Adolescence
1,cruise01,Pete Davidson steals the spotlight in this comedy film about a coming of age.,7,25 March 2020,"(3.5 out of 5 stars).Big Time Adolescence is a comedy film about a teenage high school student Monroe. He could never make friends of his own age. But has been best friends with Zeke (Pete Davidson) ever since his childhood. He was his sister ex after things did not work out. They kept in touch. Hang out. Zeke is a college drop out and not sure what he wants to do with his life besides get high every day and hang out with his stoner buddies. While Monroe parents and sister is worried that his best friend is going to hold him back in life.The plot was pretty decent about a coming of age story. Monroe is shy in high school. Could never fit in with anyone else. But he could definitely be himself when he is around Zeke. Who is older than him. He takes advice from Zeke which may not be the brightest choices. About girls. Goals. And life.The films direction is a little bit entertaining with some humor and laughs. Can be a little cringing with Monroes awkwardness. The cast ensemble was pretty decent with their performances. Pete Davidsons performance was a lot of fun as the stoner Zeke.Overall, Big Time Adolescence is a pretty fair film about a coming of age story with fun stupid humor. But the story is nothing different that we have seen before.",Big Time Adolescence

Gluck is an empathetic and relatable center for the film, but Davidson is the star; he was made for this role, and he nails it.",Big Time Adolescence

4,paul-allaer,A different kind of coming-of-age movie,7,14 March 2020,"""Big Time Adolescence"" (2019 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Monroe, or ""Mo"". As the movie opens, Mo is daydreaming in class and then led away by the principal and a cop. We the go to ""Six Years Earlier"". ad we get to know 10 yr.old Mo, as he hangs out with his sister and her 17 yr.old boyfriend Zeke. When his sister breaks up with Zeke, Mo continues to hang out with Zeke, and they become close friends. We then turn back to today, when they are 16 and 23, respectively, Alas, Zeke does not always provide the best example for growing up... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you';; just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of writer-director Jason Orley. When we think of coming-of-age films, we typically think of films like the recent ""Eighth Grade"" or ""Thirteen"" or perhaps even ""Palo Alto?. Let me tell you upfront that ""Big Time Adolescence"" is not that film. It's brought from a different perspective for one: a 16 yr. old whose parents inexplicably let their son hang out night after night with a college dropout who means well but is a classic slacker or loser when all s said and done. This is billed as a comedy, and yes there are a lot of funny moments in, but more of the chuckling kind than they are the laugh-out-loud kind. A good example is when Mo meets a girl in school that he likes, and Zeke gives him some ""can't miss"" dating advice. Watch the ensuing consequences! The movie features pretty much a no-names cast, except for Pete Davidson (from SNL) who plays Zeke. Beware: this movie is rated R for a reason, and there is lots of cursing and underage drinking and doping, so if that bothers you, better check out something else. In the end, the movie flew by in no time.""Big Time Adolescence"" premiered to immediate acclaim at last year's Sundance film festival (yes, over a year ago), and Hulu snapped it up and is now giving this a brief theatrical run. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally: 2 people including myself. (This was the day that the coronavirus was declared a national emergency.) If you are interested in a slightly different coming-of-age movie than what you have seen in the past, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Big Time Adolescence

Avoid at all freaking cost!",1,3 June 2020,"This film start with young man ""Monroe"" capture by the police at school, and the flashback of six years ago scene! As turnout, this film is about the friendship between Monroe and his drug dealer friend ""Zeke""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene!

6,yusufpiskin,Sundance,6,14 May 2020,"Does this movie do anything special? No. Does this movie do anything never done before? No. I love it though. This is a truly depressing coming of age story. It depicts the reality of how bad the mistakes you make as a kid can actually end up being. Griffin Gluck and Pete Davidson give heartfelt and heartbreaking performances. This movie is a darker Superbad and a better Mid90s. This movie really shows why I love Pete Davidson. This movie does things that have been done before, but does it in a way that personally resonates with me more than most other coming of age movies.",Big Time Adolescence
7,aidanratesmovies,A Wonderfully Entertaining Surprise,10,3 April 2020,"A hilarious, poignant, and incredibly entertaining story of growing up, Big Time Adolescence doesn't just pump out another forgettable coming of age film, but instead breaks the mold and does something truly different. The film is full of many really good performances, most notably from Pete Davidson and Griffin Gluck. The romance part of the film involving Gluck's character can seem a bit forced at times, but it does prove to flesh out the story better than expected. The script is quite brilliant, by providing not only a modern day outlook on high school adolescence, but friendship, and the consequences because of it. The direction makes the film seem very focused, and it feels very personal. The film is surprsingly extremely entertaining, and not once in the film did I ever feel bored, or like it was dull. There are a few moments in the film that I thought could have gone smoother, but as these type of films go, it is quite an impressive feat. In the end, Big Time Adolescence is a very entertaining tale of growing up, that doesn't shove the hardships too much down the viewers throat like so many others, or simply rely on old cliches. Through Orley's writing, and Davidson and Gluck's acting, the film is able to transcend its own potential, and provide something truly eye catching, and real, and though it may not nail every mark, it does far more than try.
My Rating: 9.75/10",Big Time Adolescence
8,questl-18592,Medium Time Adolescence,6,2 July 2020,"I watched this movie. I know I did. It didn't really make an impression at all though. Is the story of two kids being kids and coming to terms with growing up. It's not a terribly original story, it's decently acted, has it's funny moments.There's nothing inherently wrong here, it just doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the myriad of other coming of age stories.",Big Time Adolescence
9,Kamurai25,Big Time fun and drama,7,12 June 2020,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This is a surprisingly touching ""coming of age"" story. I'm not a big fan of Pete Davidson, but he does what he does well enough.I could imagine many people relating to this in several different ways, and what's more is that it feels timeless. Yes, they have cellphones in this, but I could imagine a greaser version of this where he comes by instead of calling, as opposed to calling instead of texting.The presentation is subtle and near perfect, everyone plays there roles very well.Its subtle again, but the writing is well nuanced. It really captures the essence of someone who got a broad future, but gets tunnel vision based on his ""childish"" wants.There is a lot of depth here if that's what you're looking for, but the minimal version of this is still a good movie.",Big Time Adolescence

12,KyleLicht,Unconventional Buddy Comedy/Wholesome Indie Film,7,22 August 2020,"This was a great and fun movie. I had the pleasure of working as an extra on the film and you can see me blurred out in the background in one of the school scenes. Pretty cool stuff. Anyway, to objectively review the film, I thought it was very pleasant and well-done. It's an indie coming-of-age/unconventional buddy movie where a 16-year old boy idolizes his sister's ex-boyfriend, as an older brother and best friend. But, he's a burnout and loser, living a life of partying, drugs, and alcohol. I can predict a lot of what would happen, but my expectations aren't completely high either. It's a fun independent film that showcases Davidson's excellent acting skills and typecast as the likeable scumbag. It also features Thomas Barbusca (of *Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp*), Jon Cryer, and Sydney Sweeney (of *Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood*). There's some good laughs, nice cinematography, and an enjoyable experience.",Big Time Adolescence

14,dan_slentz,Excellent Acting.. Interesting Movie.. NOT a comedy!,5,9 May 2020,"The acting in the movie was actually excellent! Great role for Pete.. and Griffin Gluck, Oona Laurence, Emily Arlook, Jon Cryer (great look as bald with goatee) and everyone in the movie were great!
It MUST be said that this is NOT a comedy. I wouldn't even call it a dark comedy. It's more like a ""coming of age film"".
I do not consider the following a spoiler, but you might want to stop reading as it says something non-descriptive about the movie's ending.
For me, the rating dropped considerably from what would have been 7 stars to 5 stars when they decided to NOT give the movie an ending. What drives me nuts is taking great acting and an otherwise VERY good movie and walking away from an end. Is there a ""part 2"" coming or what.. because this just ends. Bummer!",Big Time Adolescence
15,johnnyhbtvs27,Pete Davidson Debut,7,12 September 2021,Great coming of age comedy with a stand out performance from Pete Davidson. He's great in the role of Zeke (or basically himself) & Griffin Gluck is good in the straight role.,Big Time Adolescence
16,nehpetstephen,Defies expectations,7,14 March 2020,"I went into this film with lowered expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.Griffin Gluck was wonderful in ""American Vandal,"" but his movie THE TALL GIRL was one of the steamiest piles of hot garbage I've ever seen, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. Likewise, I've been generally unimpressed by Pete Davidson's appearances on SNL. I was expecting to only watch about five minutes of this movie before shutting it off. The hackneyed opening doesn't help. (Hook with something dramatic happening. Voiceover of main character saying, ""It wasn't always like this."" Cut to title card ""EIGHT YEARS EARLIER."" Like Morty says, we should start our stories where they begin, not where they get interesting.)Anyway, I'm glad I stuck past the worrisome opening because the film is actually quite solid. Jason Orley's direction is assured and engaging. The characters seem like real people. The things they say and do seem refreshingly believable, the chemistry between them is palpable and lived in, and you get the strong sense that their lives extend beyond the page--all signs of exquisite writing and direction. Although it's all fairly low key, there's some good humor, emotion, and suspense blended together in equal parts. I watched this by myself on the couch after a very long, busy day of work, and I found myself thoroughly transported--smiling during flirtation scenes, grimacing during awkward moments, occasionally laughing out loud. This is a story that we've all seen before several times, but Orley makes it new and interesting.I do feel that the film is ultimately not empathetic enough toward the Zeke character. Yes, he's a mess who frequently makes very bad and hurtful decisions. And yes, the first half of the film does persuasively show his charming side and how someone could be seduced by that. But I think the problem with the film's conclusion lies in the wording I just used. The final act of the movie seems calculated to show that Zeke's actions were all a ""seduction,"" implying some malicious intent, like his terrible advice for how to manipulate girls. But I don't buy that. Zeke's relationship with Mo definitely had a lot of dysfunctional elements, but in their interactions, it's also very apparent that Zeke has a genuine love for and attachment to Mo, for a wide range of messy reasons. If their friendship were to be severed, it seems that the Zeke we've been shown would truly be hurt, even if he chose to express that pain in some dysfunctional way. The movie doesn't give us any access to seeing that pain, even though it does give us access to seeing him alone in other private moments--scenes that seem calculated to show us what a filthy dirtbag he is.So by spinning Zeke's treatment of Mo as the ultimate manipulative seduction, the movie in its final moments really doubles down on the conclusion that he's a loser and that other people are naturally and obviously better than him. As it's presented, we're supposed to accept these confirmations about his worthlessness (in contrast to other characters' worth). But although the actions of the characters in the film do seem like a very realistic depiction of what might happen to real people in such a situation, somehow the overall package of this movie's conclusion seems a little oversimplified--and, ironically, that's only because of how good the rest of the movie is.The whole film is built around a core sense of empathy that fleshes the characters out with real feelings and reactions, yet having the moral of the story be ""this guy, however, really is just a total loser who deserves to be alone"" belies that approach. The final shot of the film seems designed to make us rejoice in the guy's total comeuppance, but I guess I would have been more satisfied if there had been just one painful moment somewhere in those final scenes that affirmed for us that even though he's a mess, Zeke's also a person deserving of dignity, and we should wish the best for him, too, even if it's best for other people to stay away from him for the time being. Such an ending would have been much more powerful for me, and I think the filmmakers are talented enough that they could have pulled it off very well.Which, now that I think about it, means that I walked into this movie with extremely low expectations, but by the time it was over, it had so won me over that my exponentially elevated expectations ended up being too high! I trust that Orley's next films will be even better, and I look forward to them.Overall, this is a very good movie. Gluck carries the role well, and Davidson, despite his lackluster performance on SNL, is surprisingly very captivating.",Big Time Adolescence
17,Steve-Zoicks,If time but slow in parts,3,28 March 2020,A nice slow movie about preteen adolescence and coming-of-age. It was nice but the storyline in the narrative is similar to almost every movie of the same kind. The acting was reasonable but it wasn't a comedy this is more a drama. I think this type of genre has been overdone over the last hundred years in film and nothing is really different in the narrative except for the actors who play. We need something different we need either a sense of war realism or a sense of my humour but if we keep making these coming-of-age movies the only thing we are doing is saying the same tail with a different visual approach.,Big Time Adolescence
18,innovativengineer,Soft 8 for a soft play,8,18 November 2020,"Start is very good with few scenes you can actually relate to . Gets a little off track but Pete Davidson pulls it off , the duo seems great . An extra 1 for The team .",Big Time Adolescence
19,phil_doucet,"Nice and short, good or bad thing?",6,22 March 2020,"This is a really short movie and maybe that's a good thing. Pete Davidson makes me feel like he is not only in character but like he is his true self in this movie. Arrogant, annoying, a druggie and not very likeable. I guess that's a testament to his acting?If you are a parent to a teenager I just don't see how you let your 16 year old spend that much time with a 23 year old and not do something about it earlier. I mean what could a young teen be doing with a young adult every single night of the week and weekend.Would have given this a better mark if there was a decent ending but unfortunately there was not.

22,elishawin2005,We all know that one person,8,26 September 2020,"I think this movie is good. Pete D did a great job because it was a relatable role. Everyone did a good job. If not personally, we all know that one person from back in the day who got stuck in life. It was so real that I'm still feeling like I'm actually glad Mo got in trouble when he did, even though he felt like it was the end of the world because it gave him the perfect opportunity to change the course of his life. If he kept on that same path he was going to end up living on Zeke's Grandmother's couch with nothing real to look forward to in his future. Surely Zeke didn't want that for his little buddy BUT in his mind it's not so bad because one day it's all going to work out and be great. Realistically that's not how it usually works. See, I feel somewhat connected to them. That's how good they were in their roles.",Big Time Adolescence
23,ajk-75755,Simply 8/10's of this film were excellent.,5,20 March 2020,"However the ending is rapped up in an oppressive hateful way to Pete Davidsons character. (Completely out of touch & contradictory ending which was completely hateful towards a guy that puts himself on the line for a friend, instead of being a straight edge character like the likely sheltered writer/director expects).Makes complete sense how they were able to gain Pete Davidson & Machine Gun Kelly as cast members, as they are both newcomers to hollywood with short resumes & susceptible to sell their soul for a paycheck.

I can see where the good reviews come from because it is certainly a good movie although I feel that it is more of a coming of age drama and not so much a comedy.

31,coopermcdonald-52056,The Start of Pete Davidson's Rise,6,14 June 2020,"Big Time Adolescence follows a friendship between two characters: Mo and Zeke. Mo (Griffin Gluck) is a coming of age teenager who grows under the destructive guidance of Zeke (Pete Davidson). Mo and Zeke's relationship is strange to the viewers. Not only did they meet because Zeke was dating Mo's sister, but the two continued to hangout even after the breakup. On top of that, throughout most of the film Zeke is 23 and Mo Is only 16.
Griffin Gluck is outstanding in his role as Mo. He's featured in a hefty number of tv series and movies, but this was the first lead role I've seen him in and he nailed it. His character is charming and relatable and Gluck does a fantastic job bringing his character to life.
The side characters are great as well, but Zeke's story is obviously the crown jewel of the movie. But his story is nothing, a black hole. As the movie drags his darkness into the light, his quirks become less and less entertaining. The story of the main character is not that resonant, but the way we see Zeke's evolution through his eyes, along with some laughs and entertaining scenes along the way, is more than enough to make this a good movie - the bitter, acrylic, burger joint ending seals the deal. Zeke, who begins as entertaining but ends as trite and soulless, is a representation of all those things people try to find meaning in during their high school years. It is the story of one man who can't connect with anyone, and who personifies all the methods people use to try and get ahead in the world without building something real. Look at all the scenes where Zeke shines - they are dark. In the night. Slowly, the movie brings his personality into the daylight. All the grime, filth, and destructive patterns of behavior are laid bare as the movie goes on.
By the end of the film, it's clear that this coming of age story proves to be more than just another teenage movie. It provides a lesson of who you should listen and look up to while developing in high school. This film is fun ride that knows just when to sit back and provide some emotional scenes for the viewer. I am rating Big Time Adolescence at a 6.6/10.",Big Time Adolescence

49,kevwalder,Really Warm-Hearted Film,8,20 May 2020,"This was an incredible film. I expected it to just be another silly low-budget comedy to pass the time, but it turned out to be a beautiful coming of age drama that very quickly brought tears to my eyes. Don't pay attention to the poor reviews out there, I think they just expect it to be some oscar nominated picture. It's not. And I think if you can understand that fact, you can better appreciate what the film is getting at. It's not supposed to be a beautiful cinematic production with the greatest actors and writing and direction lol. It's supposed to be a short, simple, but complete film serving as a reminder of what it was like to grow up and learn about who you are and who you want to be. Don't expect the best, but don't expect the worst either. If you pay enough attention, there are some key life lessons that make you think and bring you back to your high school days when life was all that much more difficult, yet all that much more simple at the same time. An awesome coming of age drama with a great soundtrack. Good job Pete!",Big Time Adolescence

51,yaboyxanman,Love it,10,4 June 2021,This movie is great the plot is amazing it really throws your emotions everywhere and does a great job of making you feel what they want you to feel acting is great as always Pete Davidson's performance is great and so is.l Griffin Glucks 10/10 this is def on my top ten movie list.,Big Time Adolescence
52,xbestofmex,Great Movie - Pete Davidson & Griffin Gluck were fantastic,9,13 March 2020,"I hope this movie changes peoples minds about Pete Davidson because he was fantastic in this film. I felt like this movie really showed how you can idolize someone older and ""cooler"" but realize at some point you need to move on from them.Pete's character Zeke broke my heart, he's a good kid with a great soul, just lost in his own problems. We all know a Zeke and we all know a Mo and to watch their friendship blossom then fade reminded me of so many friendships in my adolescence. The last scene where Mo sees Zeke in his rear view mirror smoking was the perfect way to end the movie. Mo will move on and Zeke will be right where he left him in that parking lot. Sad but true for so many young adults.Not an overly crude movie (not that I mind that) and had some really beautiful scenes that perfectly captured what it is like to be growing and changing in high school. Highly recommend this movie!",Big Time Adolescence
53,bertrum96,Surprisingly good movie!,9,16 March 2020,"So the movie starts out in a way that you don't really know where it's going. But that's because of the good acting. Pete did such a good job his character was kinda scary, because he didn't give anything away by Over or under acting.He played his character perfect. and the rest of the cast did the same. The acting in this movie supported the writing so well, I could take in each scene one at a time.It was nice to see Jon break out of his normal role right before my eyes. Each and every actor did such a good job.I want to see more!",Big Time Adolescence
54,kylecaglion,This movie broke me,8,5 November 2021,"Let me start this with the fact that I have never reviewed any movies on here before, this is my first, I also wrote this review immediately after watching. These are my raw feelings on this movie.This film featuring the endlessly funny Pete Davidson broke me. The story line were a teenage boy befriends a grown man, Zeke, talks about the beauty of friendship. A bond created when Mo the main character was a pre-teen, the friendship continued to grow until his 16th year. Mo is at the age now where a teenage might start becoming more interested in adult things. Mo turns to the older brother figure in his life, Zeke. Zeke (played by Pete Davidson) a wildly unsuccessful adult, working at an appliance store. It's my belief that everything was taken from Zeke, his parents. In the film we learn that his own grandmother, seeming the last person who cared about Zeke passed away recently, though we never see it in the film. Zeke makes the most out of his life, befriending everyone who he crosses paths with and standing for what he believes. In the climax of the movie, we see that when all is lost and it seems like the end is near, Zeke pulls Mo out of his situation, saving him (Temporarily) from curtain doom. Mo however does what he feels is right, which brings us back to the very beginning of the movie with Mo being called by an officer. At this time we find the relationship is cut with Mo and Zeke. It isn't until the most heartbreaking scene that we see the metaphor of Zekes life before our very eyes. Mo, Zekes only friend and only family, drives away, leaving Zeke to fade away into a lost memory in the mind of Mo.This film was funny, heart warming and heart breaking at the same time. Pete Davidson does an amazing job portraying depression and mental illness, while a minuscule scene speaks volumes on the mental health of Zeke. Mo (played by Griffin Gluck) does an excellent job in portraying the attitudes and likeness of a 16 year old boy on the cusp of manhood. Doing what he feels is right can only be exemplified by his closest friend Zeke. The same man Mo leaves behind for a better, more directed life. This movie is the only one in my entire life that had me crying well after the credit rolled. Jason Orley did an amazing job in writing and directing this fantastic film. A must watch for fans of Pete Davidson, as I believe this is his best work. This is one of those movies where there is no shiny red bow at the end to make everything alright. It feels real. To some, it may be how life actually is. A rare thing that is comfortable and uncomfortable.",Big Time Adolescence
55,samrussell99,Some People are Black Holes,7,20 March 2020,"Pete Davidson is great. He's great because he's playing himself. He is the ultimate antihero. Zeke's influence is felt in every scene of the movie - the parties, the girls, all of it. They are all infused with his patina.Zeke, who begins as entertaining but ends as trite and soulless, is a representation of all those things people try to find meaning in during their high school years. It is the story of one man who can't connect with anyone, and who personifies all the methods people use to try and get ahead in the world without building something real. Look at all the scenes where Zeke shines - they are dark. In the night. Slowly, the movie brings his personality into the daylight. All the grime, filth, and destructive patterns of behavior are laid bare as the movie goes on.Most of the characters are interesting. Machine Gun Kelly is hilarious in his role. Zeke's girlfriend is good too. The kid plays his part well. His perception reflects that of the audience, even though he isn't really all that interesting himself. Most scenes are entertaining. A couple are stereotypical.Zeke's story is obviously the crown jewel of the movie, and his story is nothing. A black hole. As the movie drags his darkness into the light, his quirks become less and less entertaining. The story of the main character is not that resonant, but the way we see Zeke's evolution through his eyes, along with some laughs and entertaining scenes along the way, is more than enough to make this a good movie - the bitter, acrylic, burger joint ending seals the deal.",Big Time Adolescence
56,gerlingk,Amazing movie... hits hard,10,15 March 2020,"So I don't usually get emotional about movies but this one it's almost impossible not to. I relate to it so much, and the ending was so Sad. I didn't rly understand why Zeke seemed like he didn't care until I read a review one here and once I understood the movie got like 5x sadderAnyone who does not like this movie is to young or to sheltered... (cough cough) the dude who said characters are unbelievable",Big Time Adolescence

58,izabella-77324,ending.,9,18 March 2020,I was so pleasantly surprised with the entire movie. the only thing that i wish was different would be more of an ending :( it was super good but a little more detail would've been much appreciated! definitely my current favorite movie ((:,Big Time Adolescence
59,jbungay-57721,This was surprisingly good,10,9 November 2020,"The only reason I clicked on this movie is cause Pete Davidson was in it, and i ended up with a life lesson. The premise is pretty basic, a young kid looks up to someone who isn't a good influence and he learns about the weight his actions have, the hard way. However, the way this movie portrays the dangers of drugs/drug dealing is very well done. The movie has this perfect mix of relatability, comedy, and reality so the lesson/moral can still shine through without it feeling forced and shoved down your throat like many drug psa's. Overall, its a good watch, I highly recommend it.",Big Time Adolescence
60,meronm-87230,love it,10,29 January 2021,I refuse to accept the ending. The movie was amazing and it had alot of my favorite actors in it so 10/10 .,Big Time Adolescence
61,mihailohranjec,A great coming of age movie,8,20 November 2021,"The movie is far from perfect, but it's very endearing. The characters have some depth to them, you can see the exact moments that are turning points for characters and the ending shows how much certain characters changed because of what happened. The plot isn't very realistic and can get boring for a bit, but the movie is overall something worth a watch.",Big Time Adolescence
62,arianner-52484,Sad ending,8,14 March 2020,"This movie gave me mixed emotions from laughing to also feeling really sad towards the end. Zeke is 23 years old and such a lovable character despite how much of a ""loser"" he is and how he treats all the women in his life. Mo, who is 16 years old, looks up to him so much but towards the end Mo realizes how much he does not want to end up like Zeke. Zeke is a really bad influence for Mo, with even Mo's dad and Mo's sister asking Zeke to leave him alone because they don't want him to screw up. Unfortunately towards the end, Mo's decisions cause him to lose the girl he liked and even some of his friends at school due to their backstabbing tendencies to save themselves from being in big trouble. Mo is clearly a good kid but he lets his false idealistic perspective of being cool like Zeke and his friends get in the way.
It is obvious how broken Zeke is about losing Mo's friendship near the end because he really does not have anyone who views him as highly as he does with Mo. All the women abandon Zeke and treat him like the screw up that he really is and he ends up doing exactly what you think he would at the end of the movie..
At the end, Mo moves on with his life not looking back and Zeke is left behind exactly where he was before.",Big Time Adolescence

64,HensLens1999,regular high school movie sort of,7,8 February 2021,"This is kind of a ""COMING OF AGE"" movie but it has two different leads. one is pete from snl who i think is mad funny, the other is the kid who has to grow out of looking up to pete. maybe they wanted u to wonder if pete was a bad influence or the kid made the chooses on his owne or if he was responsible? i don't know. but i liked petes other movie on staten island.",Big Time Adolescence

66,rubensimmons,Bittersweet comedy,8,14 March 2020,"I think this film nails it in realistic situations. I thought the main actors did a superb job on their characters.

68,bogdanglavonjic,To anyone who thinks that the ending is crap.,9,29 March 2020,The whole movie by itself shows you that ''that life'' does not bring anything good it just destroys you from within.The ending means that Monroe is leaving everything behind him.,Big Time Adolescence
