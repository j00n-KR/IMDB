0,Leofwine_draca,Seen it all before,3,30 November 2015,"The latest horror film from producer Eli Roth, who also has a cameo appearance playing, you guessed it, a clown. CLOWN is a film almost entirely bereft of ideas and originality. The whole storyline is that a guy transforms into a demonic clown. The problem with this is that it's just not significant or involved enough to sustain a feature length film, which is why it worked much better when I saw exactly the same storyline in one of the stories in anthology horror film SCARY OR DIE.CLOWN has a low budget, grungy look and the lack of money is often apparent. The lead actor, Andy Powers, contributes a passable performance, but his character is never for a moment likable or interesting outside of his affliction. The reliable Peter Stormare (FARGO) is much better but limited in support. There are thematic links to the likes of THE FLY, but for the most part this is just an excuse for the infliction of pain in lots of mild gore scenes. Sure, there's the odd imaginative idea here and there - I love the rainbow brain splatter - but they're lost in a mire of inanity and sub-par film-making.",Clown
1,nogodnomasters,This is a bad idea,7,17 October 2017,"Kent (Andy Powers) is a real estate agent running late for his kid's birthday party, one where the clown canceled out. At a client's home he discovers a clown suit in a chest. He puts the suit on and sure enough he selected ""the cursed"" clown suit, one that requires the sacrifice of little children. I hate it when that happens.The film had a few good horror scenes, but was mostly drama filler, poor Kent lamenting in his suit.The film had good scene changes, i.e/ Eli Roth did a professional job with the mechanics of shooting, scene lead ins, etc. but needed to up the horror aspects.Great final kill scene.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Clown
2,kosmasp,Pleasant surprise,8,9 March 2016,"It might be a mess from time to time and it might not always make completely sense, but it is a fine movie nevertheless. And I have to admit, I never thought I'd like the movie the way I did. I thought it'd be just another slasher and wasn't really expecting something that takes its time to explain the plot and is actually suspenseful and keeps the tension from start to finish.The acting is more than decent and one bad decision is the starting point of it all. Though who'd have thunk it, except for the viewer, that one should not just put on things. Especially when you have a time and money issue. So everything is well thought of, even if the movie is kind of off. And it is mean and violent too, so nothing for the faint of hearted, even if the drama at the beginning might suggest otherwise!",Clown
3,gavin6942,A Successful Gamble,7,23 May 2015,"A loving father (Andy Powers) finds a clown suit for his son's birthday party, only to realize the suit is part of an evil curse that turns its wearer into a killer (Eli Roth).When it comes to the plot of a clown suit that turns its wearer into a demon, there is a lot of room for failure. The idea is a bit cheesy, and it becomes a bit more cheesy when you add in the back story that ""clown"" comes from the word ""cloyne"", some sort of Scandinavian demon. In such films as ""Rare Exports"", they successfully tied Santa Claus to the Krampus, but had history on their side. Could ""Clown"" succeed? In short, yes. We get a fast-paced horror story, with excellent effects and more than a little gore. Some of it a little nasty (which we have come to expect from Eli Roth-connected features), but nothing so over the top that it is repulsive. And there is no cheesiness. Some very, very dark humor, perhaps (the rainbow blood is a nice touch), but this somehow managed to stay serious and actually believable.Well done, everyone. You gambled, and the gamble paid off. Hopefully this movie gets the attention it deserves.",Clown
4,ma-cortes,"Gory and fantastic terror movie with suspense, chills and intriguing end",6,20 June 2021,"Nice terror movie dealing with a sympathetic father : Andy Powers and his son , when the birthday party get ruined due to an entertainer clown, daddy puts on a clown suit he finds at home, subsequently realising that's cursed . From now on , everything goes down hell. Along the way, he is helped by his wife : Laura Allen , and a stranger man : Peter Stormare, while pursues his son : Distefano and other children , but happenings go awry. The Kids aren't alright. They're as terrifying as you think. No one is safe.Creepy and scary film with thrills, chills, shocks and lots of blood and gore. The premise results to be a weird clown outfit that holds an evil curse throughout the movie and it won't come off. An intriguing and suspenseful film wih a number of surprises, fantasy events, and terrifying final result. Interesting and twisted script from Christopher Ford and director Jon Watts himself, adding collaboration by Eli Roth who produced as well. Accompanying the thrilling story an adequate cinematograpy by Matthew Santo and frightening musical score by Matt Veligdan. This one turns out to be one of the best films in ""Killer Clowns sub-genre"" , whose main representations are ""Killer Klowns from outer space"" 1988 by Stephen Choido, ""IT"" 1990 TV series by Tommy Lee Wallace, ""IT"" 2017 by Andy Muschietti, ""IT chapter II"" 201 by Andy Muschietti.Financed in medium budget by the famous producers Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein from Dimension Films.

Rating : 6.5/10, decent horror movie.",Clown
5,BA_Harrison,Send in the cloyne.,7,12 June 2015,"When the entertainer at Jack's birthday party cancels at the last minute, his loving father Kent (Andy Powers) steps up to the plate to play Dummo the Clown, putting on the costume he finds in the basement of one of his properties. But after the party is over, Kent discovers to his horror that he cannot take the costume off: the wig, nose and hair are stuck fast. Tracing the original owner of the costume, Kent learns the terrifying truth: the clown outfit is made from the hair and skin of a Scandinavian demon that is slowly taking control of his body.This is not the first horror film to exploit 'coulrophobia'—the fear of clowns—but it is the first one (to my knowledge) to try and create a mythology that explains exactly why the colourful circus performers might give so many people the shivers. According to Clown, their origins can be traced back to Iceland, where a white-skinned, red nosed demon known as a 'cloyne' once terrorised locals, feeding on children during the winter months.This fanciful explanation for the strange phobia makes for a fair amount of demented fun, director Jon Watts delivering a film that effectively blends the disturbing with the darkly humorous, offering up a satisfying dose of gore in the process (including the gruesome demises of several minors—a cinematic taboo that is still rarely broken). There's a noticeable lull in the action towards the end of the first half, as Kent endeavours to find out more about his mysterious clown-suit, but the pace picks up again after the poor sap's unsuccessful attempts to end his ordeal by blowing his multicoloured brains out and rigging a pair of rotary saws to slice off his head: the second part of the film sees Kent paying a visit to the bully who has been pushing Jack around, stopping off at a Chuck E. Cheese to find another young snack, and eventually returning back home, where his wife Meg (Laura Allen) puts up a valiant fight to protect her son.Other fun moments include a cool decapitated dog scene, a desperate Meg offering up a trusting young girl as a sacrifice, and the tragic ending in which Kent's torment is ended via a hefty swipe with a sledgehammer.",Clown
6,michaelRokeefe,Everybody loves a killer clown!!,8,13 September 2016,"Jon Watts directs and shares credit for the screenplay. Gorier is better. A slow bloodbath with little motivation, but a wonderful invitation to be terrified. Young Jack (Christian Distefano) is really looking forward to his birthday party complete with clown. But when the clown fails to show and not to have the party spoiled, Kent (Andy Powers) puts on an old clown suit, to save his son's party. But when it is time to take the clown outfit off, he can't remove it without causing bodily harm. Yes, creepy and a bit scary. The last fifteen minutes are to die for.Music by Neil Sedaka and Nirvana are part of the soundtrack. Also in the cast: Laura Allen, Peter Stormare and Chuck Shamata.",Clown
7,Scarecrow-88,Clown,4,11 September 2016,"Potent graphic violence at times and bizarre premise are what somewhat salvage a rather unspectacular presentation. Pacing drags and instead of a sense of real horror exploited to its potential, the handling of the film is a bit subdued and cold. I just found myself underwhelmed. The plot has a real estate agent father finding a clown suit in a house he's about to sell. His son's birthday party had a clown cancellation so the father puts on the suit, wig, and red nose (applying makeup as well) as a replacement. What the father doesn't realize is that the costume curses him with a child-hungry demon which gradually transforms him into a monster. Five kids must be eaten in order for the father to be released! Ghoulish plot, to be sure. The fate of a kid who sees him as a clown, continuing to come around his hotel room, with an attempted suicide beheading with two running electrical saws going awry and the evil influence of clown demon causing him to go after kids in a indoor playground (similar to Chuck E Cheese) are both especially disturbing. Eli Roth's name was attached to this much the same way as Craven and Barker's were in the 90s to projects exploiting their name more than anything as producer. The pregnant wife protecting her son and unborn child while nearly deciding to sacrifice a girl who knows her as a seemingly trustworthy dental assistant is a secondary conflict along with researching her husband's clown costume dilemma. A gunshot in the mouth causing brain matter spattering on the wall of a bathroom mixed with colored clown paint and a really nasty attempted beheading after the use of a blade and chain (eventually the head is pulled from the neck wound, as the medulla oblongata makes it particularly difficult!) are the film's showstoppers. The bloodletting is rampant...like when pop goes after one of his son's foul-mouthed bullies while the kid is in the middle of a shooter video game. Grisly accidental use of a box cutter to pry away the costume from the father's arm and the unfortunate episode regarding the red nose being pulled away from his face are added violent bits.",Clown
8,LeonLouisRicci,"""Not for the Squeamish""...Killer Klown Slaughters and Devours Taboos",8,30 September 2016,"Not many Taboos are left to Shatter and this very Disturbing Movie takes the ""Killer Klown"" Sub-Genre to its Logical Conclusion and Slaughters the Taboo of On Screen Bloody Violence to Children. Then it Big-Tops its own Chutzpah and has the Demon-Clown Eating the Kids like Snacks. He has to Eat Five of the Little Ones to Survive (the number of months in Winter).Not for the Squeamish, as they use to say, and for Once it is Actually Appropriate. You need to be able to Stomach the Aforementioned (with little humor to help it digest) to get through this Gore-Fest from Producer Eli Roth.Roth's usual Tastelessness is Saved in this one because the Director shows some Real Talent for an Artistic Color Scheme and Frame. There is a Suicide Scene that is so Darkly Colorful that it is a LOL Moment. One of the Few Funny things in this Deadly Display.Overall, it combines the Best of ""Mother Goose"", ""Grimm's Fairy Tales"", and Pre-Code E.C. Comics and Delivers a Frightful Film that will Satisfy its Target Audience. Others are Strongly Cautioned to Contemplate the Value of this Type of Entertainment as Enjoyable.It's anything but a Casual Concern, especially if Children being Harmed Physically and Emotionally is something You want to Avoid at All Cost. For Horror Fans it's a Must See.",Clown
9,neil-476,"You'd expect rubbish, but you'd be wrong",7,4 June 2021,"When the clown booked for his son's birthday party fails to show up, real estate agent puts on a clown costume which had been left in an estate sale property, and steps into the gap. And then finds he can't take the costume off...I know, you're looking at that synopsis and, like me, you're thinking, ""I know exactly where this is going."" Well, admittedly, it isn't overburdened with surprises, but it is definitely a cut above what you would be expecting.Produced by Eli Roth, it is fairly gory. And for a film with a distinct black comedy edge, it has aspects which are very dark indeed. Peter Stormare is, as ever, great value for money, but the rest of the cast were also very good: I hadn't heard of anyone else.This was not at all bad.",Clown
10,FlashCallahan,The tears of a clown......,7,30 April 2015,"A little boy's birthday party gets ruined when his entertainment cancels. His father finds a clown suit and becomes the new entertainment but something doesn't seem right about it.Soon he discovers there is an evil curse and it won't come off.......I had many reservations about watching this film. Simply calling the film 'Clown', felt like a cheap shot, after all, many people have a great fear of the titular character, so it sounded as inviting as a film called 'snake', 'heights', or 'spider'.And plus, the fact that it had Eli Roths' name plastered all over it didn't do it any favours, after all, the man hasn't some anything of any relevance since Hostel.But, it's a surprisingly solid horror, solid enough to become a cult movie in years to come, and one of the best b-movie horrors in the last twenty years.Because it doesn't try to be Meta, it doesn't try to reference any other horror movies intentionally. Basically it doesn't do all that wink wink stuff to the audience that most horror films do now to try and distract the audience from the poor end product.It's just a nuts and bolt horror movie about a man who puts on a suit, and the suit begins to take over him. Now if this was Venom in Spider-Man 3, that movie would have been something.So the film is straight-forward. The first act focuses on the fear of claustrophobia, and him being unable to get the suit off. The second act focuses on change, as the suit becomes the man, the killing starts after he realises he cannot end his own life.Plus the second act features Stormare, who is basically in the film to provide the exposition and the origin of the clown. And predictably, clowns are born of evil.And then the third act is totally bonkers, the change is complete, and the film has nowhere else to go, so why not go all out bonkers?It's a fun movie, really minimal on humour, which is surprising for a film with this subject matter, and it's very dark, in the sense that children are the main focus of the Clown.Although it looks a little on the cheap side, its a surprising gem hidden in all the dirge that gets released in this genre.",Clown
11,trashgang,not gory as expected for a flick with Eli Roth being involved,7,16 March 2015,"Eli Roth being involved in a horror flick always got my attention. Being known for gory flicks i always want to watch his flicks. But here he didn't direct this horror but played the freaking clown. And he did well but the movie itself never got my by my throat. It wasn't that bad but it is a bit too long for me and naturally a clown being involved you will think of It (1990). The flick itself started off rather good but it's after a while that it dropped a bit for me. We do know that something is wrong with the clown suit but to figure it all out and to watch for the transformation it took way too long. Towards the end naturally it delivers the gore and horror but for me it was a bit too late. And the ending is so open that a second flick can appear when this one becomes a hit. Eli Roth as a producer here have left me with a bitter feeling,Make it a 20 minutes shorter and it would have been a good flick.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Clown
12,deloudelouvain,Another scary clown movie with a slightly different story,6,6 June 2017,"What I will never understand is why some people are afraid of clowns, or mimes etc... I don't think they are scary at all so it remains a mystery why so much people are freaked out by them. My wife is one of them. Just the image of a normal clown freaks her out, so with this movie she's being scared from the first minute till the last. This clown is definitely evil looking so for that I would understand why you would be scared. The story itself is something slightly different than the clown movies we are used to. It's easy to follow, with a bit of gore every now and then. To me the gory parts could have been more detailed to make it better but I guess the lack of budget has something to do with that. The cast is okay for a movie like this one. You never watch a movie in this genre to see great acting, it's just about the horror and the thrills. So you could say it's not a bad movie for this genre. Better than some others that I saw, for sure.",Clown
13,Hellmant,"Creepy, very unsettling and disturbing!",8,23 June 2016,"'CLOWN': Four Stars (Out of Five)An indie supernatural horror flick, co-produced by Eli Roth. The film was written by Christopher D. Ford and directed by Jon Watts (the duo also teamed together on last year's 'COP CAR'). It stars Laura Allen, Andy Powers, Christian Distefano and Peter Stormare. The movie tells the story of a man that puts on an ancient clown costume, for his kid's birthday party, and then can't take it off. He becomes possessed by it, and starts having sinister urges. The film is based on a fake YouTube trailer, that Watts and Ford put online (in 2010). In the trailer, they claimed that Eli Roth was producing their movie (even though he wasn't involved with it yet). Roth was so impressed by this, he decided to co-produce the film! I really enjoyed it. Kent McCoy (Powers), and his wife Meg (Allen), are hosting a birthday party for their son Jack (Distefano). The clown that's supposed to show up, for the party, can't make it. Kent, in desperation, puts on an old clown costume, that he finds in the basement of a house he's selling. He then goes to the party, in the professional clown's place. Kent's a hit with the kids there, including his son. Then he falls asleep, while he's still wearing the clown costume, after the party's over. The next day Kent can't take the costume off, and strange (nightmarish) things begin happening. The movie is creepy, very unsettling and disturbing. It's also really funny, in a very darkly comedic way, and Peter Stormare is classic in his role. The special effects are impressive, and the directing is more than adequate. The film's concept is also brilliant, and I can definitely see it becoming a popular franchise; with many sequels to come (deservingly so). The only real complaint, I have with the movie, is it's pacing; it could have been trimmed down (at least a little). Other than that, it's a pretty entertaining 'fright flick' experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8E1WKbyL3YM",Clown
14,thesar-2,Ciller Clown from Another Place,9,11 April 2015,"Holy crap. When I saw the ""fake trailer"" for this years ago, I was quietly thinking: YES, YES, YES, YES. It helps that there has been an onslaught of waaay too many haunted house/ghost stories that has dominated the horror marketplace the last decade and this preview, despite being fake, was the horror I wanted to get back to.Mercifully, Eli Roth saw this trailer and ran with it to make his own Clown. I'm sure as heck glad he did.This has to be one of the most fantastic, scary, gruesome and fun horror movies I've experienced in probably two decades. This would've been perfect for me to see when I was much younger when I couldn't stop watching enough horror movies. Thoughthe images and deaths on screen most likely would've given me nightmares and scarred me for life. So, um, I guess I take that back. It's probably best I see it now, as an adult.A last minute birthday party clown cancellation causes Dad to don a very old clown costume and perform at his son's birthday party. Unfortunately for him, and well, many others, the costume, wig, makeup, etc, won't come off. Worse, he's progressively growing into the legend behind the outfit.Heath Ledger's Joker has to be my favorite clown, though he was pretty sadistic, purposely chaotic, a thoughtless killer and without an ounce of remorse. THIS clownmakes Joker sane. Regardless of this being an Eli Roth production (and vision,) you would still not expect the victims of this movie to be who they were: kids. In fact, in most of these types of movies, namely A Nightmare on Elm Street, they barely ever showed any younger victims – all late teens to twenty-somethings. This moviewell, yeah, the targets were what clowns were invented for and there is no holding back.Fortunately, most gore and violence against the kids was off-screen and what was left on screen was like the rest of the movie: homage to 1980s horror, as in gore splattered on objects to indicate, though avoid showing, a horrible death. I had enough and seen too much violence against kids/babies from sick and unwatchable films like A Serbian Film and the abomination, The Human Centipede II. Yes, here I was shocked when the kids were gonna get it, and yes, it was still gruesome and absolutely frightening, but I was pleased with the lack of unnecessary images of their demise as this would never happen anyways.Man, I loved this movie. As stated above, this homage to 1980s films is exactly what I've been looking for and gave me faith in Hollywood that they still know that horror isn't exclusive to ghosts or haunted places. Or possessed dolls. Oy vey!* * *Final thoughts: I highly recommend this, if you can get your hands on it. My friend purchased this from overseas, and I think that's all that's available right now. Shame this hasn't come here wide. I suspect, even when they made a horror out of the evil spirits genre and they believed in it, they're getting shut down because America doesn't want the classic horror any more. They just want their ghosts. Sad.",Clown

16,bowmanblue,Quirky little horror,6,20 July 2015,"I've been watching Eli Roth's horror offerings ever since he grossed the world out with 'Hostel.' Granted most of his work post that little gem have been a little below par, but I still have hopes that he'll return to form. I wouldn't say 'Clown' is exactly memorable or a classic in its genre, but at least it's a step in the right direction.The clown due to entertain at a child's birthday party lets the family down. Luckily, the dad has access to a home up for sale and all of its contents. There, he finds an old clown suit and puts it on in order to entertain the kids. This is all well and good... until he finds that he can't actually take the thing off.Most people would say that it's a pretty horrific prospect in itself to be stuck in a grubby old clown's suit for the rest of your life. However, what's really bad, is that it starts affecting his mood... with murderous consequences.Normally, there's already some ancient monster running around, so it does make a bit of a change to see a loving father slowly changes into the monster in question.The acting is pretty standard all round – nothing special, but nothing bad either. Plus there is a kid in the film. Kids can be hard to watch at the best of times, let alone in a low budget horror. I'm pleased to say that here the boy is tolerable enough not to spoil the entire film. There is some gore, but not much - don't expect a major 'gore fest'. The 'horror' of the film is in the make-up – which is pretty nasty during the final act.'Clown' is nothing special, but, if you're a fan of the horror genre, it's certainly watchable and different enough to raise itself – ever so slightly – above the piles of forgettable films in the genre.",Clown
17,paulclaassen,"Bloody hell, this was creepy - and totally unpredictable!!",7,24 December 2020,"Holy crap!!! Of all the movies that surprised me this year, 'Clown' has to be at the top of the list! This is NOT what I was expecting. 'Clown' is one of the biggest surprise movies I've seen in a long time.And when I say ""surprise"", this is defined as shockingly the opposite of what I expected. Where do I even start? Ok, lets start with the most obvious: Andy Powers. Wow, he is fantastic in the role of Kent, the father who becomes the clown. The premise is simple: Kent and his wife Meg plans a clown-themed party for their seven-year old son, who loves clowns. When the event coordinator informs them the clown was double booked, Kent finds a clown outfit and delights his son as a clown.However, the following day things start going very wrong. I don't want to ruin it with spoilers, as this is a film you have to see for yourself to fully appreciate the surprise factor. My gosh, this film is just relentless!! The film features incredible effects and make-up, and is creepy as hell! I mean, this is seriously one of the creepiest films I've seen in a very long time.What I enjoyed about Kent, is the fact that he didn't hide anything from his family. He told his wife exactly what was happening and what he was going through. That made it more realistic, and I rooted for this character all the way. Andy Powers is just so incredibly good. Thanks to his brilliant acting and the use of facial expressions, I felt every bit of agony he experienced. I firmly believe the film would not have worked so well without him in the lead. I also have to commend director Jon Watts for a job well done. There was no room for sentimentality or mercy 'because the victims are kids'. He went all out to bring us one of the most memorable horror films in recent years.The film is fast-paced and very, very disturbing due to it being so relentless. Children should NEVER watch this!! 'Clown' is completely unpredictable and a truly unique possession tale. I LOVED it!!!Would I watch it again? Oh, absolutely!",Clown

Allen plays Kent's wife, Meg and Stormare (Fargo) plays Karlsson, a man who tries to help Kent break the curse. Clowns are truly creepy and this film proves it

Only now he can't take it off.The movie kind of reminds me of Kevin Smith's Tusk (not as good, however). It's the same odd disturb feeling. This guy has to live his life in a clown costume. It's seems funny at first with his fellow co workers laughing at him and his father-in-law now having the best visual reason as to why he's not good enough for his little girl, but then you don't know how to feel as he attempts to take it off and the only thing that's happening is that he's hurting himself. Than it takes a turn for the more disturbing with this whole back story how evil real clowns are and what it will take to get out of the costume, and how far this clown's wife will go to get him out. It does mess with your head.Eli Roth produced or executive produced the move and it does have his style all over it. Clown, tends to poke fun at the cheesy horror clichés, almost banging us over the head with the Stereotypes and Archetypes of the horror genre, but I have to admit those moments do make the movie more fun during slow paces when you realized that some one made a feature length movie about a guy stuck in a clown suit.It's not scary, but a little distributing, and it works just enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth that makes you feel that you did not waste your time watching it",Clown
20,kevin_robbins,This is an underrated gem in this genre worth a viewing,8,20 September 2021,"Clown (2014) is currently available on both Tubi and Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a man planning a birthday party that includes a clown for his son. The clown cancels on the day of the party causing him to scramble to make his sons dreams come true. He finds a clown outfit in the attack and puts it on for the party. Unfortunately once he puts it on he finds it impossible to take off. This movie is directed by Jon Watts (Spider-man: Homecoming) and stars Andy Powers (Spider-man: Homecoming), Laura Allen (The 4400), Peter Stormare (Fargo) and Elizabeth Whitmere (Hands Maid Tales). I absolutely loved the uniqueness of this storyline and the clown backstory and evolution. There's a lot to like about this movie. There's some really clever shot scenes like the Suicide attempts and black light sequences. Powers does a great job of displaying both transformations - the human and clown side of him. The makeup and attire changes over time and are also very well thought out and done. The ending wraps the concept up well. Overall this is an underrated gem in this genre worth a viewing I would score a solid 7.5/10.",Clown

24,peterp-450-298716,Entertaining ...,5,25 March 2015,"Perhaps you have nostalgic memories about attending a circus when you were young and you had fun while watching the clowns act. My advice. Don't watch ""Clown"" because these idyllic reveries won't be the same anymore. And also, were you scared of clowns and thought these were horrible impersonations, you definitely shouldn't watch. I guarantee you the phobia will grow out into clownish proportions. For me who has no emotional connection with clowns and enjoys a ghastly horror, it's mandatory to watch this movie. Just one thing worth knowing. If you're wondering which movie is shown in one particular trailer and the thought of plagiarism comes to mind, I can tell you that this is a fake trailer created by director Jon Watts. The moment Eli Roth saw this trailer, he couldn't restrain his enthusiasm and the only thing he wanted to do was to turn it into a feature film with himself as a producer. Although Kent looks rather ordinary as a clown in the initial stage, the final transformation ensures a grim and frightening character. He can join the club of creepy clowns like those in the movies IT (Stephen King) and All Hallow's Eve (A trashy tale, but with an ultra-scary clown as main character). I am convinced that there exist other horror movies with a creepy clown in the lead.The trouble starts when Kent (Andy Powers), a real estate agent, is forced to replace the clown who was booked to perform at the birthday party of his son Jack (Christian Distefano) and whose schedule got mixed up a bit. Luckily he discovers a complete clown outfit in the house of a client, in a chest that is chained to the wall (what a coincidence). Kent appears at home dressed as the clown Dummo and ensures a spectacular birthday party for his son. The next morning, however, he comes to the conclusion that he can't take off the costume: it seems to be merged with his own human skin, the wig is suddenly his natural hair and he can't get rid of the clowns nose despite all efforts. Ultimately he discovers that the costume is made off the skin of an evil demon, called ""The Cloyne"". Kent gradually transforms into a bloodthirsty Killer Clown with an insatiable appetite.The initial idea isn't so bad, but the final result is a bit too soft in my opinion. But rest assured, there are plenty of ""suggestive"" thrilling moments and gore scenes, but it's never straight-in-your-face horror violence what you'll get to see. And yet I enjoyed watching this film (despite the linear storyline with a predictable ending). There are some funny moments, like the clumsy way Kent tries to get rid of the suit and the sublime decapitation mechanism Kent designs, which provides a very different outcome. There are also some subtle fine details elaborated, showing that the makers have looked further than their (red?) nose. Just as Derek in ""Afflicted"", Kent is unable to take his own life. The only thing that was added to this fact was the confetti. Quite funny and a proof that creativity was indeed present.There are some gruesome scenes (for experienced horror fanatics still a bit soft) and the atmosphere is sometimes really unnerving. The part that takes place in the indoor playground was extremely thrilling and creepy. You can be sure that you'll be looking at a ball pool in a different way from now on. For me this was the most magnificent moment of the entire movie with claustrophobic images in a labyrinth of corridors, shown in an explosion of colors. But as mentioned before, the central theme around which everything revolves, isn't explicitly portrayed. If you want to promote a creepy and gruesome horror movie, you have to have the guts to handle this in the whole story. Now the most gruesome scenes are handled off-screen and your imagination has to provide the missing images. The inner struggle that Kent should engage with the demon, who tries to change his personality, takes up a large portion of the film. Perfectly outlined but maybe it was still a tad overemphasised. Most horror fans will say that the transformation unfolds way to slow and that they rather saw Kent appearing as a bloodthirsty killer clown much sooner.In terms of performances, there is no one who excels or disappoints. Andy Powers (unknown to me) manages to show the creepy clown in a convincing manner and with its various facets : entertaining, sad and desperate, resisting, fighting and finally sneaking around as a maniacal killer, looking for victims to satisfy his hunger. Laura Allen plays the desperate wife Meg who (obviously) must face the ultimate confrontation with her ""transformed into a not so cheerful clown"" husband. Christian Distefano evolves from a clown lover to a frightened little boy who eventually throws his plush clown in the bin. Who wouldn't ? The most amusing supporting role is played by Peter Stormare as the pretty disturbed Karlsson. The Swede Stormare is such an actor who takes care of small roles in many films (The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Armageddon, Bad Boys II, Get the Gringo, The Last Stand, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters ...). His contribution in this film is of greater importance.""Clown"" has its good sides and lesser sides. Unfortunately, there won't be much publicity about this film and most likely you'll only see it on DVD. The idea and the development of the theme about the clown is rather successful, but the final result is still just an average movie. I enjoyed myself while watching it, but I'll still go to a circus without any worries or fear. And I'm surely not going to run away in a panic when the clown act begins.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Clown
25,vengeance20,A Grim & Bloody Horror Film!,9,8 March 2015,"Haerd about this film a while back & have been looking forward to it ever since it's release. The film has a pretty basic setup. A loving father Kent finds an old clown outfit in the attic to substitute for a clown that is doubled booked & had to cancel! The party goes down well with Kent as the clown replacement. But after waking up the next day, he finds he can't take off the suit & tries fanatically to cut, slice & rip off the outfit to no avail. His wife Meg tries to help him as he runs away & tries to figure a way to get the suit off. She eventually finds & tries to help him but he escapes!The film goes at rapid pace from drops of blood to buckets as Kent begins to change into a blood thirsty child killing demon! Which in the middle of the film, by Karlson is explained that the suit is skin & hair of an ancient demon that kills children!The back story of the film was interesting & fitted in well! Unlike others which have a back-story that's just ""Thrown In"" & makes no sense! The blood was top notch & didn't fail to amuse! The theme of the film it'self was dark & gloomy! Which I felt really added to what was going on!You really do begin to feel sorry for Kent as things go from bad to worse in seconds! But after a failed suicide attempt (which involved him accidentally killing a prying child) he eventually gives in to the demon & devours the him! Grim as F**k!The scene in the play area was well done! Again grim & dark!However the ending I wasn't entirely bought by! I mean it ended well but Meg had to kill her husband who was possessed by the demon! She wasn't the one bit sadden & sorry for doing this! It seemed like a difficult decision, sacrifice her son & her husband will be free or kill her husband & let her son live! But why couldn't she just find a random kid to sacrifice to the demon clown? The ending would've been better had this been the case! Overall the film is pretty good! Gory, dark & grim in so many levels! Though the ending wasn't exactly a great one, the film as a whole is pretty intense! 9/10",Clown
26,quincytheodore,What begins as wardrobe malfunction escalates into the stuff of childhood terror. Clown is no laughing matter.,7,8 May 2015,"This movie might just ruin someone's childhood. It transforms what could have been trivial concept into a particularly eerie showcasing of an individual's deterioration. The character development hides a few fascinating twists, they adapt to the malady with surprisingly convincing reactions. It appeals to the curiosity of audiences as they are more invested in increasingly insidious transformation of once an ordinary man.Kent (Andy Powers) is a real estate agent who finds strange clown suit on one of the houses he sells. Serendipitously or not, he needs a clown to entertain his son's birthday and takes it upon himself to don the costume. Later on he discovers that the suit is something much more sinister than he previously thought. This concept of a man becoming more disfigured physically and mentally has been done in The Fly, Clown uses the same allure quite effectively.The cinematography doesn't uses overwhelmingly terrorizing atmosphere, instead the first act is shot in simple manner. As it escalates, both visual and practical effects are becoming significantly darker. Much of the visual rests on the make-up and believable costume, the presentation of titular character is commendably persuasive. The clown could've been silly, but it retains and even enhances its creepy visage throughout the nasty phases of transformation.The actors perform proficiently as well. Andy Powers looks normal which makes his personality change more drastic. Laura Allen as Meg, his wife, is not the usual damsel-in-distress. While she finds his husband's ordeal to be perplexing, she must decide on difficult choices, Laura Allen displays the torn motherly role with powerful conviction.Clown delivers a compelling horror tale by turning an elementary subject into the stuff of children's nightmare.",Clown

Then the Dad goes to take off the clown suit,,,,,,,, but it won't come off,,,,,, yipe?!?This was a bit dark and twisited for the same director that has brought us Spiderman Homecoming and Far from Home,, but it just shows range imo.

28,gregsrants,Much Better Than Expected,7,9 March 2015,"This hurts to say – Eli Roth is no longer a 'go-to' name for me in horror. Ouch. Go back a decade ago and I didn't think that possible. I was present when he brought Cabin Fever (2002) to Toronto and again in 2005 when he introduced his Canadian audience to Hostel. I met Eli a few times since and I think his knowledge and enthusiasm for horror is outstanding.But since 2007, Eli has focused himself more on acting (Inglorious Basterds) and producing (The Last Exorcism). Since then, the quality of the projects that bear his name on the film's one sheet has been sub-par. The Man With the Iron Fists (2012), The Last Exorcism II (2013) and The Sacrament (2013) were all throwaway entries on an ever expanding filmography. And don't even get us started on Netflix's timewaster series Hemlock Grove.So when I saw the DVD cover for Clown with Eli Roth's name above the title, it was hardly the seven letters in the actor/producer's name that had me walking out of the market with the disc under my forearm.Clown has an intriguing premise. A demon possesses a clown suit and morphs anyone who dons the outfit into killer that preys particularly, yet not exclusively, on children. Andy Powers plays Kent, the unlucky son-of-a-bitch that adorns the found garment to appease his son Jack who is awaiting a cancelled clown at his backyard birthday party. But after applying the suit and make-up, Kent finds the outfit impossible to remove. He also finds an increasing appetite that is appeased when a child is devoured while straying from his campgrounds.Kent attempts to remove himself from his family life and seclude himself to where he may be a lesser threat to those around him. But as the demon begins to take hold, Kent's cravings for violence extended outside his given will and even the help of someone who has history with the suit, Karlsson played by the always reliable Peter Stormare, might not be enough to help stop the demon's rampage on the youth of his stalked community.I was intrigued by the idea behind Christopher D. Ford and Jon Watts' screenplay and the idea did feel fresh and at times inspired. Jon Watts does double duty behind the camera and executes the fine line of dealing with a serial killer of children with diplomacy. But it's the diplomacy that grounds the film from really taking flight. Unfortunately, the kills are largely off-screen with only the bloody after affects represented after the deed is completed. I am sure this was done to keep censors edit happy but if the gore was to match say, Eli Roth's Hostel II, in this format, we might be talking about Clown being the horror movie to see if 2015. A particular chapter where our morphing demon ends up at a ChuckeCheese was a particular waste of a fantastic opportunity to showcase unmuted violence in an extraordinary setting.Still, Clown was an above average horror film for its ilk. It follows some of the horror film handbook 'To Do's' that are as aggravating as they are accepted, but there is enough freshness and commitment to the overall goal to keep Clown's head above the recommendation waters.And now back to Mr. Roth. Although Clown is hardly Silence of the Lambs it does provide a definite upswing on the Roth career chart that was beginning to resemble my investments circa 2009. Let's hope the momentum continues and I can update the first sentence of this review in short time.www.killerreviews.com",Clown
29,Patient444,Remarkable cheesy fun!,6,1 March 2015,"I love Clown! A complete surprise for me, came out of nowhere, when I was the poster I was expecting nothing but a class C kind of horror, but boy was I wrong!What makes it so much fun? The transformation itself is simple and brilliant! They take their time but they make sure to always keep you interested, waiting to see what happens next, how things will evolve and so on. Clown is a natural movie, they didn't bother into too much gore, nor nudity, but instead they actually focused on the story. And I have to say, it was a good one, effective and sometimes haunting!It is a sure thing that most horror fans out there will dig this on for sure. Without saying too much about it, if you liked movies like Rare exports or Sint, this one you'll enjoy even more because in my opinion, it is better! Clown, simple and effective!Cheers!",Clown
30,Seth_Rogue_One,Predictable horror fare that seems amateurish,5,4 July 2015,"First things first, Eli Roth has top-billing here among the credits as Frowny The Clown, which leads you to think (well at least me) that he will play the lead.But no, that role is played by the unknown Andy Powers, in fact I tried really hard looking for Eli Roth in the movie or any other clown for that matter but I couldn't find him anywhere!I have no idea what that was about, maybe he was hiding somewhere in the background but yeah he's definitely not the lead.Anyhow, the movie follows any rule of the book of horror and therefor is truly predictable to the t, it also takes itself way too seriously while not having the competent direction or acting to back it up.Laura Allen pulls off a decent performance and Peter Stormare always entertains but other than that I wasn't too impressed with the acting.It never really get scary either and the scare scenes are fairly poorly orchestrated, yeah overall it feels like a not so great indie horror.If you want a movie about a killer clown may I suggest STITCHES (2012) instead, or why not go back to the roots and re-watch IT (1990).",Clown
31,nathanmanson,Meh,4,7 January 2019,"Wasn't really scary, it was gory but again not scary. If you like gore films you'll love it but if you're a scare freak you won't really enjoy it and Kent wasn't massively punching above his weight.",Clown
32,RossRivero99,Very disappointing,1,28 May 2017,"Last weekend my sister and I were talking about killer clowns and how scared she was of them, and while she was surfing through Netflix she found this movie and I dared her to watch and making her as well as myself watch it was probably one of the worst possible decisions that I have ever made. The movie does start off good however starting the Stirling at a little boys' birthday party and his mother (Laura Allen) is on the phone with her husband Kent (Andy Powers) and asks him to wear a clown suit in order to surprise their son for his birthday, but nobody knows right away that it's a cursed outfit which is the biggest plot twist of the story and Kent can't get it off after trying anything and everything he possibly could do get it off of him. After that this is where things get really boring even though I was expecting to bite my nails and scream like a little girl even though I did none of that throughout the course of the movie. Then the suit controls Kent's body and mind turning him into a cannibal clown, and in turn his a man to help her return her husband back to normal named Karlsson (Peter Stormare). Then everything gets totally predictable, and everything goes right out the window, and after watching this I was totally disappointed with Eli Roth because I thought that would be good by the look of it and now that it is a week after watching it I question why people call him the ""Master of Horror"" after producing a total piece of cinematic trash like this, I mean after the beginning of the movie the whole plot goes downhill and takes the movie right down with it, the screenplay makes the movie predictable and boring to the point where we don't even care about what kind of trouble that the characters happen to be in, and the performances are just plain terrible. But don't get me wrong I love a good horror movie which are movies like ""Psycho"" (1960) and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) which brought on real scares unlike this movie which was a total gore-fest, this isn't the worst movie that I've ever seen but it sure is one of them.",Clown
33,MattBrady099,Well I enjoyed this messed up movie,6,19 March 2015,"Never again would I look at Clowns in the same way after seeing this movie but that get's me thinking, when did I like them in the first place.The story to Clown is about a father discovers the clown suit and decides to wear it for his son's birthday party. However, he soon discovers that the suit turns the wearer into a killing machine.Clowns never scared me because I always know it's somebody else in cheap looking make-up trying to make you laugh but really they creeping us out. I have seen many movies and TV shows with scary looking clowns in it and yes I can see why people are scared of them but they never took a big effect on me, until I sawed this and for now on I will stay far way from clowns if possible.You can hate or like the film Clown if your a horror fan or not, for me I like my horror movies best served cold and freaky, and Clown to me isn't a bad flick. I can see a lot of effort went into the make- up and the design of the monster clown.To those who have seen the movie did you think for a second that Eli Roth directed this movie, yes I know he stars in the movie but the movie has that style look to it that Eli Roth himself would use and I'm saying that has a positive.The acting in the movie was surprisingly pretty good from Andy Powers and Laura Allen. The directing as well was pretty good from other horror movies today. Normally I don't like over the top gore in movies as I think it's a cheap way to get 18 rating or if your American Rated R, and to be honest I didn't get that in this movie for most of the time you don't really see much of guts flying everywhere but most of the after math of what happened.For problems with the movie I have some like: The characters in the movie are mostly forgettable and I'm not talking about Laura Allen or Andy Powers characters, I mean the other supporting or the background characters that always seem to get screen time which they shouldn't because they stupid and dull to watch.The movie dose have some clichés that really stick out and I thought we are already pass some of the clichés when it comes to horror movies today, but luckily after a while the movie forgotten the clichés as it went on. Oh remember when I said some of the acting was good well the kid actor was a bit noticeable that he's trying to be scared but I didn't buy it not for one bit.Besides that Clown overall isn't a bad flick, now some people may not agree with me and that's fine you got a opinion and that's awesome I'm not going to be like those dick heads that start yelling at you for nothing. Well I enjoyed this messed up movie.",Clown
34,lathe-of-heaven,There are many other Killer Clown Horror films out there that I personally like a lot better... Blu-ray: Excellent A:9 V:10,4,29 May 2015,"Normally I do not go out of my way to review movies that I don't like. And, I have made a STRONG point of mentioning MANY times in my reviews, that I do not feel it is fair or helpful to come here and trash a film simply because you do not like that particular kind of movie. That doesn't really help others to know whether it is a 'Good' film or not of it's type. That is primarily why we come here...Well, this one just reinforces the reasons why I personally despise Eli Roth. So far, from what I've seen from him, the ONLY thing the guy has 'going' for him (if you can call it that) is that he likes, cold, sadistic, brutal gore and violence. Now... Before you say, 'Hey, the movie is ABOUT a Killer Clown, you Dickweed!' Yes, I know that... :) However, there are Killer Clown movies and there are Killer Clown movies (a more profound statement I have never made...)So, the dilemma that I find myself in is this... I frigg'n LOVE Killer Clown movies, but I completely LOATHE Eli Roth. So... I figured that at least I would watch the movie and give it a chance. Okay, I did... Now, do I choose to review it...? Well, firstly, I would not come here and take a dump on this film JUST because it is presented by Eli Roth (after all, he didn't direct it) But, after watching the movie, I felt that I could come here and honestly give it what I felt was an OBJECTIVE review based SOLELY on whether I thought that the film was well done or not, regardless of Roth's influence. So, that is why I am writing this.FWIW, I FULLY agree with the reviewer Andrew Gold (May 2015) I thought he really nailed it. He focused on the fact, and I agree, that the movie itself simply doesn't build any real atmosphere and doesn't really involve the audience in the characters or even the story very much. Here is a direct quote which is right on the money, ""Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialog and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie."" And one more that pretty much sums it up, ""It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of children in this movie and child actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland child trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland children.""There you have it. Even completely ignoring the fact that Eli Roth has anything to do with it, and giving all the stupidly done gore a pass (most of it was just bloody NAUSEATING, NOT scary...) and just looking at the film as a film... In my lowly and wretched opinion, it just wasn't that involving, it wasn't really done that well, the acting was below par for everyone, and last but not least it just simply did NOT entertain. I don't know about you, but I watch movies to be ENTERTAINED. And yes, I understand that people are entertained by VERY different things. A case in point, I do NOT at all like Torture Porn. Thus my strong dislike of Eli Roth and his 'HOSTEL' like pedigree. HOWEVER... I appreciate the fact that many others truly do get off on stuff like that. Okay, fair enough... So, therefore, I wouldn't come here and deliberately give 'HOSTEL' or 'SAW PART ""x""' bad ratings and reviews just because I do not like those kinds of films. BUT... I DO indeed like Killer Clown films, so I feel that I can come here and objectively write about how good or bad of a Killer Clown movie THIS film is.This movie not only did not do much for me personally, but I also found it's tone blandly mean-spirited and NOT, I repeat NOT entertaining in the least. It is my personal feeling that people like Eli Roth just simply have NO bloody idea how to make a Horror film that ENTERTAINS. One that disgusts, sure. One that disturbs, yep... You know, it kind of reminds me of Stephen King's style, which is why I stopped reading him LONG ago. People like this seem to have only ONE note, ONE tone, ONE dimension, and that usually is just being coldly mean-spirited, and using gore and brutality just for the sole sake of it. Hey, if that is what does it for you, then fine, maybe you'll like this one... Now, before you all hang yourselves... just ONE more thought, if I may please... Take James Wan, for example. And YES, he did direct the first 'SAW' film. However, just about ALL of his subsequent movies are genuinely involving, VERY well constructed, scary, and fully entertaining. They are FUN movies! And I LIKE fun movies... Just one example that stands in STARK contrast to the 'style' shown in this film here.So, the bottom line I would say is this... If you like straight-up brutal, meaningless Horror films and you are not that particular about the acting or tone or the finesse of constructing an atmospheric mood, then you may well like this one. But, for the reasons that I have gratuitously stated here, if you are like me and you want some true atmosphere, believable characters, or creative style in your Horror films, and if you like FUN movies, then this one will likely leave you flatter than Chaz Bono...",Clown
35,Finfrosk86,Pretty cool but lacks take off,7,15 March 2015,"Saw this at Frightfest Glasgow 2015. Naturally I was a little intrigued by Eli Roths name being attached to this title, although I'm not that big of a fan of his movies, I think he seems like a cool guy. Anyhow, he just presents this movie, and has a super tiny role, that you likely won't even notice if you don't know where to look. This story seems kind of fresh, you haven't seen exactly this a thousand times. And I think the first half, or the first two thirds of the movie is the best. I was kind of waiting for it to really get crazy, but it didn't deliver perfectly. The effects are pretty good, and it has some decent gore. The acting is pretty good, and it's always nice to see Peter Stormare. The movie has some funny moments, and is a quite nice blend of scary and funnyish.There is something lacking though, it sort of flats out towards the end. But that might just be my taste. I think it needs a second viewing. It was definitely a Frightfest high light. I enjoyed it.",Clown
36,dcarsonhagy,A Very Nice Attempt,6,20 March 2016,"I, too, had seen many advertisements about this film and never thought it would be released. I caught it the other night on On- Demand. I was not disappointed...well, not too much.The film tells the story of a family devoted father who has called and ""rented"" a clown for his son's birthday. Unfortunately, the agency has had a mix-up and Kent and Meg think their son will be hugely disappointed. The father (Kent) finds and dons a clown suit, and it looks as though the birthday celebration will be saved. Are they in for a surprise. You see, Kent did not actually find a clown ""suit."" What he found, as we later learn, is the actual skin and hair of a horrible demon; a demon whose appetite can only be satiated by eating children.I liked ""Clown."" However, with just a few minor tweaks, it could have been one of the scariest films released in a long time. Instead, the first part of the movie seemed very slow to me. I also did not understand why suddenly everybody turned on Kent. It seemed the father-in-law despised him, for reasons never explained. Once Kent's actual transformation finishes, this is a ghoulishly dark film.Rated ""R"" for horror gore and violence, please take this little warning to heed: ""Clown"" is NOT for children. Some images and the demon frightened ME. So, please parents, if you choose to let your children watch, I suggest you at least watch with them. More of a 6.5 movie than a 6. A very decent try.",Clown

38,jamiedarlow-37510,'You know you can always talk to Dummo.',4,10 April 2020,"The directorial feature debut from writer/director Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming, Cop Car) is a pretty by the numbers horror movie but with some nice twists along the way. Kent (Andy Powers) is a dedicated father who, upon hearing that the kids entertainment can't make it to his sons birthday party, stumbles upon a clown costume and decides to dress up and be the entertainment himself! All is fun and games until the day after when he discovers he can't take it off. The more he tries the more welded it seems to his skin and searing into his flesh. He looks for the source of this outfit and what dark secrets lie underneath it. It's a pretty cool premise but unfortunately it's played with such a straight face that it's hard to have a huge amount of fun with it. It has wonderfully gory moments (one including a nose right near the start which is really tense!) and is performed well with a particularly crazy role from Peter Stormare! The mythology behind the Clown is explored really nicely and the creepy origins could've done with a little more screen time.

They did a pretty good job of making the clown truly evil and scary looking.",Clown
40,TheRedDeath30,I Really Wanted to Like It More,6,8 October 2016,"I think that I try pretty hard to judge a movie based purely on the product that I'm viewing. It can be very easy for all of us to go in with preconceived notions, either good or bad, that skew our opinion of a film. When you continuously hear how great a movie is, then it becomes hard to judge it independently. For some, they hear it's great, they think it's great, it ends up giving you a puffed up impression. More likely the opposite happens, it becomes hard for a movie to live up to that hype, as is the case for CLOWN with me.It's not a bad film, by any means, and has some really solid ideas and direction, but it also shows the work of an amateur director making one of their first feature films and mistakes are made along the way, certainly. In case you haven't heard the plot yet, we begin with a birthday part for a young boy who wants a clown party. Unfortunately, the clown they book cannot make it. Dad comes to the rescue. Fortune shines on him (or the writers could think of no better way to insert the most important plot device) because Dad is a real estate agent and the home is trying to sell just so happens to have belonged to a costume salesman. That salesman just so happens to have a clown costume in a trunk. Dad rescues the party and becomes the hero, only there's a problem. He can't get the costume off. While at first this leads to some funny jokes, it becomes more scary for him. Eventually, we find that this is not a costume at all, but the skin of a demon who has now possessed our hero.One of the best and worst things about the movie was the direction in tone that they chose to take. In the hands of a lousier director, this movie would have become one giant cliché. We would have got yet another ten cent variation on the Pennywise evil clown design. The clown would have gone on a murdering rampage, with a squeaky horn thrown in and some ""don't ya like clowns"" jokes for good measure. This movie takes a whole different path. The introduction of a mythology and using a demon is somewhat unique and added a new wrinkle to the clown horror genre. Mostly, the movie is not a ""slasher"" in any way. Yes, we get copious amounts of blood and some intensely scary moments, but it's actually far more of a psychological horror film. The main impetus of the movie is the terror that this father feels as he realizes he is trapped in this situation. As the demon slowly takes over more of his body and mind, the father has a sense of desperation and despair that is central to making this movie work. It, also, brings me back to why it doesn't work so well, either. To start with, this brand of horror relies heavily on our investment in the character. We need to feel their terror and feel for them. We don't get to know dad well enough before the terror begins. We are supposed to know and accept that he's sort of a hard luck loser as a dad. He's trying his best. He wants to be a good dad, but he just can't get it right. The father-in-law is an important character here and we are reminded, repeatedly, that he doesn't really approve of his son- in-laws parenting. None of the reasons for any of this are shown to us well enough, though. I think the director and writer needed to do a better job of introducing us to dad and the chemistry of this family before plunging into the main plot line.I did like the design of the ""final creature"". It was a well- thought out construct of presenting us with a Pumpkinhead type demon while utilizing elements of typical clown costuming into that design to make it believable and unique.The biggest problem I have with the movie, though, is really no fault of its' own, but it is still the topical choice of the film makers and so the decision lies in their hands. I just have complete and utter clown fatigue. Go to a mask convention. Walk into a Halloween store. Browse through the indie horror selections on your favorite streaming service. Heck, look at the news as I write this and creeper clowns are showing up in every town. The evil clown has become as prevalent as the vampire or the zombie and I'm just sick to death of the whole thing. Probably part of it is that I was never a person who had any fear of clowns, so it doesn't touch on any nerve for me, as it may for some, but it's become so cliché and overused that I just don't want to see evil clowns anymore. Yes, the movie takes a different approach, as I outlined already and that helps it, greatly, to rise above crap films that just want to give us a clown in black makeup and call him scary, but it's not enough to make me forget that I'm watching a whole movie based around a cliché.",Clown
41,ghost_dog86,Is it an absolutely disgusting notion that I liked a movie about a clown who eats children?,7,14 August 2016,"Writer/director Jon Watts made a little low-budget drama called ""Cop Car"" which received fair reviews from critics. ""Clown"" was his other film; a film universally panned by critics as something akin to hot garbage and produced by Quentin Tarantino's forgotten stepchild, Eli Roth. That said, is it an absolutely disgusting notion that I liked a movie about a clown who eats children? Synopsis: A man finds an old clown costume and wears it for his son's birthday party. In the morning he can't seem to get it off. And when he tries, things get bloody. Layered atop this plot line is a really creepy eastern European clown origins story, which is actually more frightening than most monster movie horror origin stories.""Clown"" isn't without flaws (shocking, I know). Basically everything Roth touches tries to be funny and just isn't. And much like many B-movie horrors, this film suffers from a reaction problem from the people being perused by the titular monster (in this case, the reactions from friends and family are curiously calm) but that can be attributed to the level of actor used in this.On the plus side for novice horror fans, much of the violence here is not as gratuitous as I would've imagined (as far as violence towards children is concerned) but more importantly, every kill is extremely well choreographed; not overly campy or silly, even with visible budgetary constraints. In fact the direction is the best aspect of this film by far, really elevating the more unbalanced and underwhelming melodramatic material in the 2nd Act into something visually disturbing and half-way scary.Final Thought: Not going to lie, there were some quite disturbing and morbid sequences involving suicide (the best filmed suicide of 2016) and child consumption, which I rather enjoyed. But all that is an acquired taste.",Clown

46,lnvicta,"Clown has a unique premise, but its execution leaves a lot to be desired.",4,10 May 2015,"Even if you aren't bothered by clowns, you have to admit that a killer clown is a pretty creepy idea. I mean clowns are always around children, they have a pale face, goofy hair and bright welcoming colors, masking the homicidal tendencies underneath. I always thought it would make a good movie idea, and Clown is about the closest we get to that. It's less of a killer clown story as much as it is a possession movie. This particular clown suit does not come off. If someone puts it on, it fuses with their skin while the demon slowly possesses them. The demon is a cannibal and only eats children. 5 children to be exact: one for every month of winter, or so the lore goes. It's an interesting take on the killer clown notion and I usually like Eli Roth so I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, Clown misses the mark in almost every way.It's an Eli Roth movie so of course there's lots of blood and gore, which is fine. Eating kids is also inherently disturbing, even though the killing is not shown on screen you do see a lot of children's guts, blood and body parts. The thing is, it doesn't really add anything to the movie. That's mainly because the movie doesn't build up much tension in the first place. It's slow to start - the dad is the one who puts on the costume to surprise his kid at his birthday party, but he falls asleep in it and when he wakes up, he finds that the wig infused with his hair and the costume is indestructible. The psychological aspect of this is interesting for a while, but it never goes the extra mile. Everything we see here has been done to death already. Just because the premise is cool doesn't mean cheesy dialogue and inappropriate jump scares get a free pass. They're still annoying as hell, and sadly they are littered throughout the entire movie.This movie has every horror cliché in the book. The jump scares in particular really detract from the movie's atmosphere. It sets a dark tone at the beginning, and even more so when the psychological elements start dripping in and the dad questions his sanity as he discovers more about the suit, but every once in a while someone will pop up behind someone else and the music will be LOUD for a second as if it's supposed to scare us. No, it doesn't work like that. All the good build up in the first two acts are dampened by these cheap scares - they give no time for tension to build before throwing another one at you, and it's just annoying after the first couple of times. The dialogue doesn't help either. Neither does the acting. Peter Stormare is great as usual but he doesn't get that much screen time. It's mainly the female lead and her reactions to her husband turning into this monster, and let me tell you, she is a terrible actress. There are also a lot of kids in this movie and kid actors are almost always terrible. You just don't care about any people on screen, except for the guy being possessed but even he is only in the first half of the movie. We're just stuck following a bland wife and her bland kid trying to stop the evil clown from killing other bland kids.The clown itself does not disappoint. It does look genuinely creepy, and the costume and make-up are very well done, but sadly that doesn't make up for a bad script and poor direction. It just has no style. It's really by-the-numbers horror with an Eli Roth tinge. The worst part is, it isn't even scary. If you're a fan of Eli Roth then you might get some enjoyment from this, but if you aren't a horror fanatic then don't bother.",Clown

Great effects, acting, story, makeup, unintentional humor, and most of all, its scary! Most horror movies people act pretty stupid, in clown they act believable. The thought of unable to take off a costume is scary. Its unclear if he can go to the bathroom, but we hear his stomach grumbling quite a bit.Its hilarious when Stormware's character says ""Oh sh--!"" b/c the clown is waking up from being drugged too quickly. The death of the pet dog is a great effect as well as scary. The effects of the Father turning into a clown are great. All the actors did a great job.I'm not sure why this didn't get a wide release at the theaters. Maybe because its very dark. But if your into scary, dark horror movies then sit back and enjoy.

""Clown"" is actually a pretty refreshing entry in the genre - being clearly of modest budget, yet still managing to come across as a professional looking flick with an unusually likable cast of characters, a reasonably memorable villain! There's also a few decent and relatively gory deaths, cleverly themed after traditional clown tricks.The gore level in this movie is extremely high. Every kill is based upon a trick that a clown but all with the intention of making your skin crawl.

51,tresm87,A very underrated grim and intriguing take on Clowns.,8,3 July 2018,"At this point everyone is well-versed and familiar with the fears of clowns, and the overall creepy aesthetic that they carry, but the concept shown in this overlooked horror gem is probably the most sinister and frightening. The fascinating spin they put on clown mythology was so depraved and evil and went in very disturbing territory, but that's what horror to me is about. Alongside just being an overall twisted horrifying film with an interesting story, I found the cinematography to be very well done and the tone and atmosphere was set perfectly through it. If you're into horror in general you should check this out and especially if you're into clowns because it delivers very well on both fronts and really doesn't hold back. You will not look at clowns the same way after seeing this film.",Clown

53,tiskec,What A Crazy Ride!,6,1 November 2016,"This movie was not the horrible mess I thought it was going to be, or nearly as stupid. I actually thought it was pretty well done. Yeah, the story of a possessed Clown suit that turns you into an ancient ""clown demon"" is a little unrealistic, but the movie did a good job of bringing it to life. The devouring and mangling of small children I could've did without. I winced at one scene, knowing it was of a mangled child. Otherwise, I'm a fan of gore. Other than that, throughout the whole movie the transformation from the dude to the ""clown"" was bad ass. The make-up crew did an excellent job with the skin cosmetics of the ""clown."" Towards the end of the film, the clown looked so awesome. Especially when the chick pulled it's head off, and all of the weird, clowny colored blood started running everywhere. The ""Clown"" also tried blowing his brains out, and this confetti colored brain matter sprays against the wall. That was pretty funny. This movie was actually pretty well done. The acting was good, the script was okay, and the dialog was good. I would recommend this movie for a one time watch.",Clown

Sometimes someone thinks out of the box and creates a totally new story for something that exists a very long time. First there was Rare Exports (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401143). A movie that showed a similar horror twist to the genesis of Santa Claus. In the same year, ""SINT"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167675) had is appearance and tels the ""true"" horror story of Sinterklaas.

55,politehere,Very Original and Enjoyable,8,7 May 2015,"This is one of those movies that didn't really scare me, because it felt like a horror-comedy, albeit a dark one. It is very similar to Drag Me to Hell in its style, and DMTH is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The difference is that DMTH is full of effective jump scares from start to finish, but Clown has very few jump scares, few of which are effective.I watched Clown for a second time and again for a third time and it started to grow on me. What made me really love this movie is that it starts off as a family movie, which is in contrast with the amount of gore you get later. The kills were funny rather than disturbing and not explicit enough for gore hounds, but I think it was intentional to be consistent with the style of the movie. There were a couple of scenes in the beginning of the movie which gave me an uneasy feeling (without giving too much away the thing with his wrist and his nose). The idea behind the movie is very original. I found myself really enjoying watching the gradual transformation from an ordinary man to a demon over and over again. The demon in its final stages had pretty scary looks. The back story about the origin of the clown was also really interesting and made me want to search the web to see if it was true. The last time I did this was with ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to see if it had really happened. After watching this movie for the third time I decided to add this to the list of ""The Best Horror Movies I have Ever Seen"" on IMDb. You can check the list out here:http://www.imdb.com/list/ls008343902/?publish=saveI recommend this movie to horror movie fans who liked the style and tune of Drag Me to Hell.",Clown

They could have even done away with the demon sub-plot and let the movie take on a more abstract terror.Like the poignant vibes of the superb 'A Ghost Story' (2017) which had genuine resonance and a feel for the material.Instead, like old wallpaper, it hangs, it cracks and then it falls. Following suit and stumbling into the blind, schlocky arena you had hoped it would avoid. Dark, noisy monster and slurpy sound effects. I believe if they had thought it through, they could have had something quite original on their hands, 'a sad and ultimately moving horror movie' Instead, they played it safe and straight into the hands of the norm.

I was apprehensive when first watching this, it could have gone either way, and 15 or so minutes in I was thinking, ""This is gonna be dumb!"" But surprise surprise, it takes some very dark turns and becomes a very enjoyable out and out horror storyI don't think I'm giving too much away by saying (This all happens in the first 10 or so minutes) Son loves clowns, Father running late for birthday party. Clown booked for party cancels at last minute. Wife calls the Father. Father working in old house and finds trunk with old clown costume and decides to step in.One of the things that makes this film, apart from the on the nose acting, is the clown costume itself. It's not bright and garish, a la Stephen Kings Pennywise, but understated. There is some humour, used to good effect towards the start of the film, but not too much and it never falls into the trap of relying on the humour, which would have been so easy with a clown based horror film.Despite initial apprehensions, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it's one of those goodies that catches you by surprise every so often.",Clown

As far as I know, this is a film with an original story. I won't ruin anything of course, it's better to find out for yourself.One of the best parts about this film is that there is no slow beginning, or slow anything to be honest, it starts pretty much as soon as you begin watching it. As the film progresses the story line begins to unfold, presenting a new tale unlike anything I have ever seen. I was fascinated by it and was enjoying a lot of what I was seeing.It had it's cliché moments, which everyone expects in a horror film so it's not a bad thing, however it doesn't offer anything new except a great story line. Sometimes it felt a little cheesy, but only close to the beginning. There were several scenes that made me uncomfortable, but I was never disturbed or scared unfortunately.It is a one-of-a-kind film and I highly recommend it to anyone. It is mediocre, only in the way that it doesn't offer anything new in the horror field. Typical gore, violence and mild humor. I would have given it a six if it wasn't for that reason.

I had very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. For a horror film, the acting isn't too bad and the script is darkly comic. If killer clowns are your thing, it's no IT, but the idea of an otherwise innocent person slowly being corrupted by a curse is reminiscent of An American Werewolf In London and adds a bit of tension to a concept that could have resulted in a substandard, run-of-the-mill slasher flick.

Oh yeah and, you no longer want food, but instead you feast on children. Premise for horror movie, check.The problem is that this film fails to deliver scares. That being said I'm not personally afraid of clowns but I can imagine that this film might scare those who are. A majority of the film is gross-out, Stephen King's least favorite type of horror. This is partly due to Eli Roth.Jon Watts did a wonderful time directing the film for his first time. Not to mention that he's also slated to direct Spider-Man: Homecoming. He also co-wrote the movie which like many Eli Roth films has great character development.Andy Powers plays Kent, the husband, turn clown, turn clown-demon. He plays a realistic approach to what lengths anyone would go to to prevent all of these horrible things from happening to you. Laura Allen plays Meg, the wife and mother who has a small arc but isn't truly used in the film till the late second and third act. Some might see the lack of her use in the first act as a flaw but I see it as focusing on developing the Clown character. Which was needed.Peter Stormare, Gaear Grimsrud from Fargo, plays Karlsson in a storytelling role that I wont spoil for you. His first impression is hard to forget and I'll leave it at that. He's by far the best and most talented actor on the set.Verdict: Not scary, but a good story. I suppose that counts for something.",Clown

I was actually expecting a tacky B-movie but this delivered in every way possible, it even has a great story, something else I was not expecting. The acting was great from a relatively unknown cast.

70,Necroambulant,Like a Nightmare Played Out On Screen,9,10 May 2015,"Eli Roth's Clown is most certainly one of the most messed up movies I've seen in some time...I'm talking Meet the Feebles level messed up. The movie begins with a father putting on a clown costume for his son's birthday party because the clown they had hired was double-booked and couldn't make it...only to find the next morning that the wig had replaced his real hair, the nose was attached, and the suit was stuck to him like skin. This is only the first five to ten minutes. From there everything gets progressively worse and more bizarre. Jon Watts manages something that very few directors are capable of doing, creating movies with unpredictable outcomes. Altogether too often I can predict the specifics of what is to come by the halfway point of a movie, if not nearer the beginning. That is the curse of those who watch too many movies and television shows, and read too many books...especially those who are creatively inclined themselves. All of that goes out the window with Roth's movies themselves, so it makes sense that something he'd produce would be the same way. The most predictable one was Hostel, and that still wasn't entirely telegraphed. I won't waste my time trying to describe this story, other than to say that it is sincerely the sort of thing that can only be defined as someone's nightmare displayed on a screen...it really feels like a bad dream that you'd wake up from, only to be unable to fall asleep again out of sheer discomfort. At times it seems like it should be funny, in the same way that Cabin Fever mixed disgusting horror and humor into something spectacularly filled with black comedy, but it's really not...and that somehow strangely manages to make it funny in a sense, albeit a perverse sort of funny that is really not funny at all. I don't know if I can say I loved this movie, because I don't know if that is a possible feeling anyone would experience after seeing this...but it was terrific.

From ball pits, to playgrounds, to hand paintings and clown toys, there's always a childish touch to this movie, despite it being excessively gruesome. This mix of childishness and gore makes 'Clown' incredibly disturbing. Undoubtedly this is the best clown-movie in the horror genre.

Okay a killer clown who prayed on children isn't original but the scripting was good and the lead cast had great roles and good acting.Clown is based on a family realtor father Kent, his wife Meg and their young son Jack whos just about to 7.The movie starts with Jacks birthday his celebrating his 7th and is obsessed with clowns. They hired a clown entertainer but unfortunately he was double booked. Looking like the party will be cancelled Kent found a clown costume in one of the homes he is trying to sell an wears it.Straight after the party he doesn't take it off, its when hes trying to go to work the next day it doesn't want to come off. Struggling he still attends his job and uses tools on site but to no help in taking it off. Getting frustrated his wife uses her dentist tools to pull the nose of leaving a huge sore.No one believing Kents worries he goes to the house and tries to track own the previous owners. He comes across a man called Karlsson who insists he doesn't touch the outfit, but telling him what he has done they meet immediately.We find out the clown many many years ago was a murderer of children who feasted on them over the winter. Karlsson tries to kill him as the demon already has taking over but fails.

I just came across the film by accident and when I seen it was an Eli Roth movie I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. I actually think that I held my breath for over an hour, and when it finished - I wasn't able to fall asleep. The story is about a dad who puts on an old creepy clown outfit for his sons birthday party. He realizes after that it won't come of, and tries desperately to cut into it (slashing his own wrist). His wife tries to help and ends up ripping his red nose right of his face. I think this is when I started to feel uncomfortable. He starts to transform.. Into an evil clown. The effects are great and I really like how the story started straight away - he literally puts the outfit on during the first two minutes of the film and things just keep getting darker. As the clown outfit becomes more restricting and you find out it's actually turning him into a demon... Who likes to eat children. At certain points in the movie his wife tries to help and save him. There's also a great bit when he decides to cut his own head off, but things don't go to plan. The character really does become creepy and sinister.

77,jmcfrancis,Good fun and pretty original,9,18 March 2015,"I liked the idea of Clown since seeing the first trailer and I was curious to see how far it would go. With Eli Roth behind it I knew it wouldn't cop out easily, but I was afraid it would go overboard. Luckily neither happened: Clown is funny, scary, interesting and bewildering all at once. It pulls no punches, but doesn't go for sneaky sucker-punches either. The plot plays out at a good pace, the characters feel real enough, the acting is solid and the ultimate transformation is certainly memorable.This is not a gore-hound film, nor torture porn. It doesn't pander to specific subsets of the horror world. Instead Clown simply plays the cards it was dealt with great effect. It is true that the movie doesn't quite hit the lights, but it is far better than so many higher-profile horrors we've seen the past year or so.I really enjoyed Clown and I hope to see a sequel!",Clown

80,gorepump,"Better than I expected, despite how silly it is...",5,8 August 2015,"I was a bit more entertained by this one than I expected. I guess it's due, mainly, to the fact that it takes the concept of demon clown transformations completely serious. Does that mean it's GOOD? Nah, not really. But a killer clown flick not being totally played for laughs isn't too common. Plus, you thrown in a handful of splattery kid murders and, hell, I'll accept whatever ridiculous clown lore bullsh*t you can toss my way.A guy fills in as a last minute clown for his kids birthday party, wearing an old clown suit he found at a dead dude's house. The next day, panic begins setting in when he finds it virtually impossible to remove the articles of his clown ensemble (rainbow wig, red nose, makeup, suit...) as they have adhered, seemingly permanently, to his body. He seeks the help of the former owner of the costume who explains that the only way to intercept the demonic metamorphosis that is taking place is to either decapitate him or feed him the proper number of children...""Clown"" offers up a fairly unique (though seemingly unintentionally goofy...) 'body horror' premise that contains a nice amount of practical effects - many of which are pretty decent - and the crème de la crème: a bloodbath at Chuck E. Cheese! I must say, the kid killing in this one is on par with another psycho clown film, ""Sloppy the Psychotic"".So, while I can't say ""Clown"" is anything all that groundbreaking, but I'll give it props for keeping with a more serious 'tone' in the midst of horror-comedies being the familiar go-to these days - even through all of the silliness and retarded 'clown mythos' - and for having the balls to slaughter little kids. I'm being generous, here, but I'm giving it a moderate rec. Also check out ""Stitches"" if you dig f*cked up clowns.More of my reviews @ http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/",Clown

There was hardly any classic scary moments, just the gory ones which makes you wanna throw out or look away.

88,the_real_Doc_Justice,Awful in every way,2,12 May 2018,"I have a weakness for Roth-related material. He's an easy target for most, who usually haven't seen much of his work if any, so for the many times he surprised me the right way, I tend to be attentive and overlook the flaws.Overlook this whole movie. It doesn't even try to have an ""oldie 80's look"", it just takes every trick in the book. Jump scares are lame, the orchestra hits will often get you to understand you were supposed to be scared a second ago. The score is AWFUL. Barely daytime TV movie level.The acting is terrible. Sure they're not helped by the scooped in dialogue, which managed to steal a few smiles from me as I wondered which awful truism would come out of the next open mouth. And as most of the action is as predictable as your average informercial, oh they do walk the walk and talk the talk.The clown, is, well, a clown. No real effort is made, for example when he tries to take off his wig and fake nose, the scene is one of the most ridiculous that comes to mind. Worse, it feels like the guy thinks he's smart and clever grimacing his way through it. Yet any slap scene from any soap drama the world over has more convincing violence than that.As I'm a jerk, I'll go on with the wife, a breeze of vapor, I wonder how many takes were necessary for her ""My husband would never do anything like that"" delivery, wich had me rewinding and replay several times over to be believed, and all the scenes poor Stormare desperately tries to get a pulse from her, and desperately tries to get done with his stupid, convoluted explainatory text. I hope Stormare got away with most of the budget with his Christopher Lloyd impression, he deserved it.And the kid. Oh the kid. I could bet that the scene of his first main appearance, where he's just sitting at the kitchen table, took serveral takes as he kept sending stares at the camera. I don't know if it was the case but it really felt that way. Most of his lines are dubbed as his facing away or backlit.The action, the gore? Nothing but bloody prothesis of little kids limbs! Yeah! How's that for fun? It fills the running time, with stupid kids running around the clown until quick snacking scenes are suggested.Any attempt of cleverness in direction is ill thought and awfully done. The very few decent scenes towards the end, you have seen the exact same ones in older, better movies.A waste of time. For children maiming afficionados only.

89,alex_van_beek,Inventive and original horror,7,22 October 2015,"There aren't too many clown films but this ranks as one of the finest in that subgenre. It has a really original and interesting take on terror origin of the clown and makes it something entertainingly creepy to watch. The storyline is well executed and follows the other trends that make Eli Roth films great fun to watch as a horror fan. There's plenty of gore and twisted violence, but it's always managed to be incorporated into a context that adds rather than just distracts from the plot in some way. There's enough films out there that offer nothing but violence in place of a storyline, and this one manages to harness violence in a very creepy and effective way towards the tone of the film.As horror films go, this is one of the most memorable that I've seen in a long, long time and as I write this I am unable to think of any other recent horror titles that were as memorable as this, in terms of the overall scare factor and anyone that manages to somehow find an original take on anything in the horror genre deserves points.I saw this film about a month or so ago and as I've only just signed up to IMDb felt that this should be one of my first recommendations as it really has stayed with me and I've recommended it already to plenty of people via word of mouth.If you hate clowns, this film will do bad things to you But if you love horror then get all over this!

If you felt the same way, I would highly recommend that you give this film a watch. In the end it surpassed my expectations and left me feeling pretty disturbed. The acting from the leads is solid, Andy Powers especially is fantastic as Kent and carries the earlier parts of the film with a really good performance. Laura Allen is also very good as Kent's wife Meg whose journey through the film is in some ways as interesting to witness as his own. Some of the supporting cast are admittedly not fantastic, but that doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. The film is generally well-paced but suffers a little during the middle where it seems to stall, don't worry if you feel this way because it soon gets going again and when it does, it really does.

98,markhale-22640,In the loin of Cloine,8,25 September 2015,"Eli Roth presents an intimate trip to coulrophobia-ville in the wackiest of fashions - fashion being the key word in that an accursed clown costume morphs its host into the parabolic Nordic demon 'Cloine', renown for chowing down on a child-per-period of a wintry season. It's ingredients: a classically Cronenbergian concept come carnivalesque, add two stock cubes of 'An American Werewolf in London"", the ""Insidious"" voracity of King's Pennywise in 'It', combined with a foolhardy idea from the second series of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Halloween' (a conjectural plucking from the 'Whedonverse""), whereby characters meld with the attributes of their stereotypical trick or treating attire subject to some eerie, nineties voodoo-hoodoo. Voila, pastiche ala peckish, peccable, polar-paediatric Dummo the 'Clown'. This lacing of intertextuality and emulation might sound a sleight of hypocritical, yet it actually works in the films favour in creating a spicy referential humour to a narrative that was - without a doubt - never going to work otherwise. It is, after all, about a man's absurdly ill-fated transmogrification into a demonic clown.Embarking en-route to a subtle humour to partner such an imaginatively offbeat yet lucrative body-horror hypothesis, 'Clown' relegates gesticulative puns to a minimum by abstracting normative routines and functions in insinuating a farcical (though realistically pragmatic) depiction of 'clownification'. Simple tasks such as having a shower, going on a school run or going to work in clown attire are worked into the feature to provide an outlet to snicker at the audacity of the concept itself, and acts as a realisation made by the filmmakers that humour is a welcome prerequisite to accompany such preposterous notion. Watching our clown-contaminated protagonist tackle his stuck-fast red nose, reappearing make-up and transmuting wig (to actual perms of hair) boils up a recoiling deadpan comedy none the more summated by Dummo's botched suicide attempts in forestalling the cometh of the cacodemon. Rambunctious chuckles in cahoots to a grimace, the rainbow coloured blood spatter that proceeds a gunshot through the mouth - and a trip to the local hardware store to build a self-decapitation machine - is indicative of a harmonious equilibrium made between horror and humour.Entrenched from the off to progress with the plot rather than loitering a slow-burning build for character development, perhaps the narrative rushes into causal linearity too quickly as most of the protagonist's brood are rendered depthlessly lean and subsidiary (or less) to the macro and could have helped in filling a few plot potholes. Nevertheless, the barmy 'Clown' posits an original concept within a parodic wrapper and entertains throughout - even if it is a tad 'The Fly' off the wall.",Clown

It's not a very scary film by any means, it's Eli Roth so of course it's gory, but scary? No. There is little to no tension throughout, and you don't actually see much of the killing (just children's body parts).The idea was good, and the effects were also well done.

107,Blackhawk1989,Smarter than most killer clown films,8,25 April 2015,"Horror movies have made something of a comeback in the last few years. After studios realised they'd ruined the slasher reboot into submission the space was open for some creative old fashioned spook stories like 'Babadook', new takes on the classic home invasion flick like 'You're Next' and suspenseful chase movies like the wonderful 'It Follows'. 'Clown' is a return to the transforming body horror nightmare.The plot is simple, but well told. A hardworking father fills in for a clown at his sons birthday party only to discover that the costume won't come off, worse yet, it seems to be filling his mind with bloodthirsty urges and making him spit out teeth. What follows is a slow journey as he slowly looses his mind and people around him loose their lives. The reveal of the clown suit and its horrible purpose is fairly flat, but I'll take it over any of Stephen Kings 'it was a thing from another dimension' cliché.What makes the movie actually fun and quite special is the main performance. Andy Powers feels natural as a parent, and horrifying as a monster. The scenes of him trying desperately to make a curious child get away from him feel like a dark take on someones horrifying urges. The supporting cast is also great, with the panicked wife, and surprisingly good child actors all coming in well. A lot of slow horror films tend to let themselves down on the gore, but Clown delivers on that too. Since the Clown is mostly out to eat few children you'd be forgiven for thinking it would be a cutaway film, but there's tons of well done gore effects.Whilst it never quite reaches the heights of the other films I mentioned, its a fun horror film I fully intend to see again. It's getting a bit of a beating for being even remotely connected to Eli Roth, but ignore that and enjoy it for what it is.",Clown

What could've been a little twisted turn on body horror movies lacks so many key components. The writing is, at best, mediocre, full of stereotypical sentences one might be sick of be now. The pacing is out of place, what starts slowly and builds up some tension, as the transformation goes on and on, flushes everything down the toilet after the first half and goes frenzy in the last 25 or so minutes. A pretty predictable plot and almost every cliché is also on board, myself got pretty annoyed by all the irrational choices the cast does. And no, they weren't done in state of emergency nor panic. Speaking of annoying - the cast. Especially the mother and her son.. a prime example of dull, lifeless and shallow acting. You also get your fair share of ""I know that would happen now""- jump scares, which adds nothing to the movie.I give it a 5/10 (a 4 would also be totally legit).

It brings us the story of Kent McCoy (played by Andy Powers) who is hosting a birthday party for his son. He hires a clown but unfortunately the clown ends up accidentally going to a different party. Luckily Kent finds an old clown suit in the basement and puts it on and goes to the party himself. After the party, Kent falls asleep in the suit and the next day finds that he can not take it off and notices that the body suit, wig and nose all begin to fuse with his body. Having no other choice he leaves for work wearing the costume.After a few attempts at taking the costume off Kent goes to his wife (played by Laura Allen) and she tries to remove his fake nose. While doing that they notice that the skin on the nose is starting to peel off too. With no other choice he goes to the hospital. There he starts to show some sings of strange behavior and starts developing a strong sense of hunger. After researching a bit he finds out that (mild spoiler) it is not actually a costume but it's the skin of a demon and the only way to satiate his hunger is to devour kids. (end of mild spoiler)I'm not the biggest fan of killer clowns but the direction that this film took was very pleasant and intriguing. The acting was decent and camerawork was ok but could be better. At the start it felt a bit cliche and cheesy but it started to pick up as the plot progressed. The gore was awesome as well which was surprising for me since I rarely point out gore in films. The pacing was very well too.However I do think that this movie could have been done much better. I enjoyed it yes but not as much as I wanted to since I really loved the premise of it.

117,bevanaaron,Really Good Concept But Could Have Been Better,5,16 August 2021,"I would like to first of all point out the positives about this movie. The general storyline of the film I actually rather enjoyed, the cast and characters within the film all did a good job to make this film a decent enough watch. I'll also give extra credit for the look of the clown within this film, it was great to see the obvious and detailed decline of Kent from human to demonic clown, the make-up and special effects to create this scary clown by the end of the movie were spot on.The reason I can't give this film a much higher rating, and this may seem harsh, but it was a very slow burner and I also think it could've quite easily been tweaked to be a lot more entertaining. As the killings started happening, in particular the children's play area scene, I couldn't help but think this should have all happened about 30 minutes ago in the film, it could been made scarier and more entertaining with more scenes like this and with them coming slightly earlier in the film. It was a very long build up coming from Kent (the main character) turning into this clown, we saw he couldn't get the clown suit off from within the first sort've 15 minutes so wouldn't say the 45/50 minutes to build up the film was necessary, but that's just my opinion.In summary though, this is not a bad film, it's almost good compared to other horror clown films and wouldn't tell someone not to watch this, it is enjoyable for the most part.",Clown

After a while he discovers that that's not a costume but the hair and the skin of an ancient child-eater demon which has already started to permeate his body and his soul. *SPOILER* He obviously starts killing and eating several kids before he gets stopped by his own wife while she tries to save their child who was about to be eaten by his father-demon-clown. *END SPOILER* The good thing about this movie is that it manages to create an anxious atmosphere and it makes you feel afraid to get your body hurt. You'll start thinking about being in something that gets stuck on you, changes and disfigures your body and your mind. There's also a lot of good old splatter scenes where you'll see half-eaten kids and regurgitated human bones. A particular note goes to the kids' playground scene, where the director manages to convert a funny and colorful place in a horrid and spectral hunting field.",Clown
119,scorpion-233,Had potential and then laughed at it.,4,2 April 2015,"I'm going to be honest here. I was actually KIND of excited to see this... thing. I thought it had potential to possibly, and I use that work generously, put fear back into a horror movie circled around something to do with a clown. Sadly, that's not the case.Clown starts off way too fast, almost giving the impression that it NEEDS to get you into it because it knows that the rest is just a straight up flat line that has some originality, but none at all at the same time.Honestly, I enjoyed the back story behind the clown and thought that it was a bit of a fresh take on the subject, but, that is ALL THAT I LIKED. Acting was not that good. It had some redeeming qualities, like the blatant Loomis-type character. I kind of liked him, although he was never used the way he should have been used.A lot of the story that didn't involve the clown was lazy and just stupid. Nothing else to say, just... God awful.Overall, this movie is kind of like a smart kid who dropped out of high- school. It has potential, it just doesn't care and laughs at anything that shines light on the fact it has potential.4/10. I was hopeful.",Clown
120,AriaSkies,Better than I expected,9,12 June 2015,"I love the opening. Images of clown toys and a clown cake being shown along with a cacophony of children screaming. Best way to start a clown movie!The acting was great and believable, and the film quality was obviously high quality. Which is a breath of fresh air after watching some of the other clown horror movies. I just have to say that Kent is a complete moron and deserves everything that happens to him after he dons the clown costume. Like, for real, who just walks into some guy's house, goes through his stuff, and puts on an antique looking clown suit to wear to your child's birthday? (This happens within ten minutes of the movie so hopefully I'm not spoiling anything that wasn't already in the film synopsis). Also, if the chest is chained to a wall, it is probably a good idea NOT to open it. There is some bad juju that comes along with messing with stuff that has been chained to walls, because they are probably like that for a REASON. But, I did like that the initials were KC (KC = Killer Clown). This movie was amazing, and I strongly recommend watching it. The only thing you might be wary of is that it depict very brutal death scenes involving children and that may hurt the sensibilities of some viewers (just thought I might warn you).**Minor Spoilers Below**The wife was a moron. That poor old guy told her countless times, ""Don't trust your husband"" and then she acts all surprised when her 'husband' betrays her. Like, yes lady maybe that is why the old guy kept telling you not to trust him!The kid is an absolute genius, and honestly if it weren't for his words of wisdom the mom would have probably ended up doing something that would have allowed Kent to escape and then her and her children would have been doomed (I'm counting the unborn as one).",Clown

122,Dranerys,Finally a decent clown movie!,7,18 April 2015,"Now this is something I have waited ages for, a decent movie about killer clowns. Ever since I was little I have been scared to death for clowns, but I still hadn't seen a decent movie about clowns. Sure, there is It, but that clown turned out to be an alien spider something, and I didn't really find it scary either. There's Stitches but I honestly thought that was a pretty bad movie. There is also this awesome clown scene in the movie Amusement, but unfortunately that was only one scene and the rest of the movie turned out horrible anyway.Here's what Clown is about: A loving father finds a clown suit for his son's birthday party, only to realize the suit is part of an evil curse that turns its killer into a killer.Clown is based on a short fan movie that was once made, and people seemed to like it so much Eli Roth decided to turn it into a movie. Oh wait, did I forget to mention Eli Roth produced Clown? I know that many people dislike Eli Roth, but honestly I don't think he's too bad. Perhaps Cabin Fever wasn't the best movie around, but I can't say I hated it. Besides, I kinda liked Hostel.The movie might have a bit of a strange concept of a suit that turns it wearer into a killer, but honestly what else might turn a human into a clown-suit wearing killer? The curse is a nice story for it I think, it's definitely a better story than the standard reason why some characters become mass-murderers. Besides, I was already very happy that there was finally a full clown movie that's actually decent and somewhat scary.You might have noticed my phrasing there when I said that it was 'decent'. It really is a decent movie, I can't say this is a incredible movie with many new ideas and insights, but it's just a nice and decent slasher. I think this is one of the few slashers in the last couple of years that actually tries to be original and actually somewhat succeeds at that, so that's already quite the head start for Clown.The make-up is done very well in this movie, at first when the plastic nose is stuck to Kent and his wife rips it off - ouch, that looked quite painful. The transformation of Kent is looking awesome as well, at first he just starts to look a bit messed up, but when his transformation is finally done he is looking very scary I think. Perhaps one of the scariest clowns I have ever seen. The gore is pretty awesome as well, ripped off children bodies, brains splashing around, and lots, lots of blood!Decent acting, Andy Powers did a fine job as the messed up clown. Laura Ellen played okay as well, by the way - how much is she looking like Malin Akerman?! I was convinced at first it was Malin Akerman instead of Laura Ellen. Of course there's also a small (tiny) role for Eli Roth as a clown, really only for a second he shows up though.I thought Clown was a fine and nice movie, it had some great gore and nice looking make-up. The acting was decent and overall I thought this was a nice slasher. I'm also very happy that finally there has been released a good murdering Clown movie because that has been ages since I have seen one. Clown is a hundred times better than Stitches, even though Stitches tries to be funny (and fails at it) and Clown is more a serious type of movie (as far as Clown murdering movies can go serious). Even if you're not a fan of Eli Roth, I suggest giving Clown a watch, I definitely had fun watching it.",Clown
123,jzolivera,Doesn't Quite Hit the Mark,4,5 July 2016,"Clown has a solid concept, and initially, it would appear as though it is following through with it; unfortunately, about halfway through the film disappointment kicks in.I was expecting something along the lines of Contracted (which if you haven't seen, you should consider instead of Clown). What Clown delivered was a good idea supported by a decent beginning rounded out with a campy B-horror second act that ruined what could have been a solid film.Don't bother. Eli Roth's name has lost the star power it once had around 2007. Clown has its entertaining moments, but in the end it misses the mark.",Clown

125,sethdarvick,STOP Clowning around!,1,14 February 2018,"Hello, Eli? Mr. Roth? Why did you make this movie? It wasn't scary or even remotely unnerving. In the trues sense of the word, it was a flop--like the noise a clown's oversized shoe would make on asphalt. This clown should have perished in a circus fire like the one they had in Hartford, CT over 35 years ago. The premise of the movie: 100% predictable. Direction: Misguided. Lighting: There wasn't any. Sound: Loud then low, low then loud. Acting: Like a crappy comic book. If you enjoy wasting your time or if you are just curious and want to see if this film could be fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000, then watch it.

126,joepromax,One of the Best Horror Films I've Seen in Recent Years,9,5 April 2017,"Am I the only one who appreciates this film as a dark comedy? The premise is straight out of a cheesy campfire story. A haunted clown suit which possesses people with an 'ancient evil'. I mean come on, how can you not see this as a silly satire of horror movies in general?There's loads of darkly comic transitions and juxtapositions, such as the wife telling Jack that 'daddy will be home tonight' followed by transition to him shooting himself in the head. Then the whole suicide scene following that in which you don't want the wife to come in and disturb his decapitation.Having watched a lot of David Lynch recently I have started to rethink what 'bad acting' really is. I honestly think that the awkward set up and exposure of the child actors to their inevitable demise is purposeful. People don't seem to be getting that this is really a black comedy and this technique of ridiculous set up to murder is part of what makes it funny. take that irritating kid playing online games for example, we don't see him being killed but we see his heart being thrown at the TV screen, it's silly. The problem is that people lower their expectations for horror films unless it's so obviously 'arty'. This film has a brutal sense of humor and it isn't cheap in it's jump scare approach unlike the majority of modern schlocky horrors out there.",Clown

The story towards the end just seemed lazy. They were setting it up as if there was some sort of cure/fix. The ending was a massive let down that after all that he was just killed and his suit was seized in evidence. The music would imply this fact was ominous but was just poor. It felt like it was just cut short.

At the start, I was honestly feeling a cheesy, B movie type with a possible special appearance by the Dwight Johnson or Dolph Lundren :) The gore in the movie was top shelf and watching it with my wife and daughter (who are both scared of clowns) made it that much better and they absolutely loved it! And my daughter still slept in her own bed. I honestly don't know if there has been a horror movie with the main character of a clown that has been this good in the last 5-10 years, if I'm wrong please let me know of such movie.

132,holdingstarsup,Not the worst Horror film associated with Eli Roth,7,7 July 2016,"I would preface I had just watched Cabin Fever (2016) reboot. Albeit it was not directed by Roth, just written, his name was plastered ALL over it--- and that was a baaaaaaaad movie. I choose to watch this film over great deliberation, and I'm glad I did. In saying that, this film was actually pretty decent. It was sort of dumb near the middle and towards the end, but I kind of expected that going into a clown-horror film. The way the film was setup as well as the character(s) background(s) was very believable. I could care less what would have happened to the wife, but she sort of rounded out the story and made you care about Kent (main character). There were many horror elements throughout the film, but I wish there was a little less blood in some of the scenes. Not that many jump- scares. That horrifying moment ""the cure"" was realized/discovered was pretty wicked. I don't know, I thought the film was really original and really stepped up the horror genre, it was pretty good in that aspect. Some of the dynamics of the film sort of contorted and didn't make sense near the end, but in all the film didn't disappoint. It was entertaining, much like a clown. I will say though that old man was pretty bad ass. Honestly I love the old man vs. horrible monster (or just external battle) trope. Best. Thing. Ever. Reminded me of The Strain (sort of). Just seeing an old man wield a meat cleaver is pretty awesome for me.",Clown

It's the execution and actors that in the end totally ruin this otherwise decent idea of a movie.The actors deliver a (mostly) decent job at trying to make the movie entertaining, however they fall flat when it comes to the child actors. I know they're not close to being as experienced or talented as the adult actors and actresses but holy f*ck were they horrible and annoying.The monster isn't particularly scary either. It's a run of the mill rubber-monster with too much gore and blood and too little attention to detail.*spoiler* Worst of all are the characters themselves. You kind of feel for the ""main"" character that puts on the suit and goes through all the sh*t that comes with it, however the female lead I absolutely cannot STAND. She's annoying and just plain stupid. The grandfather character goes into the same category. The actor doesn't help with the fact that he delivers his lines terribly.In the end, it was a predictable movie without a whole lot of substance and just too much focus on those fake ""jumpscares"" where they set up an atmosphere of ""You're going to be spooked in a second"" where after it's a main character jumping OUTTA Nowhere to scare the main protagonist for no reason WHATSOEVER.

It doesn't top penny wise but it puts a good twist to the clown genre. It comes in at close 2nd place! The movie starts out fast, you get to grab all the details up front within the 1st 10 minutes. It actually gets pretty funny after right wards then it gets real from there on out. It does have 2 slow spots, it rolls pretty fast. The clown looks awesome! you get to see it develop throughout the movie, which is a nice slow burn. Its just not like BAM here it is... its a slow progression. It doesn't look like Bozo the Clown with blood, it looks like a real monster, which was awesome! I've read a lot of reviews on how parts of the movie are not realistic. I could see 2 parts, but you know, its a fictional movie.This does have a feel of a fast paced Sci-Fi channel movie in the beginning, but then it starts to rev up into a real movie.The ending is really predictable, but its a good ending, its not confusing, it ends on a good note. After you watch that movie, your clown phobia will def take new heights.If you want a good scare, with a few laughs, this is it for you.

Overall it was a very good gore flick and the premise was great. I have never been a fan of clowns and although I do know they are just make-up and ridiculous costumes, they still gave me an uneasy feeling. Now my whole concept has changed and I for one find clowns a thing to look at with more of a ""pondering"" thought of what is under their whole premise. I did however especially like the comic way in which the suit is trying to be removed. It began as comical and slowly moved to terror for the wife and son. Like others have said, the transformation from a subtle dad in a clown suit to the final version was very good. Slow and constant. It did keep me awaiting what was to be next. The special effects were very well done and obviously a lot of time went into the end results. Throughout the whole movie I was held firm to my screen. A very good horror/gore film.

Sadly, nothing that terrifying ever crosses our screen. However a commendable job by Roth to slap his portrayal of 'Frowny' on the 'Clowns to Make You Sh*t the Bed' wall of fame, but no praise can be bestowed upon Peter Stormare's useless yet 'horror movie correct'character, nor the emotionally detached log, being Kent/Frowny 's wife Meg (Laura Allen emitted no care for her on-screen husband and neither did I). Watts clearly had no idea at what pace he wanted to obtain around Kent's transformation (Suddenly... The costumes stuck! - He's had that bulbous nose for a month now - A hobgoblin appears)combined with miscasting and concerning reality checks (who could possibly sleep wearing a full clown costume?, nose and all!)diverted Clown off its hoped for path of extreme 'Roth' gore and that one scene where Frowny visits the strippers.",Clown
141,oliviapoe,A definite shocker,9,18 December 2020,"I think most people upon stumbling across Clown would consider it one of those cheesy low-budget killer clown flicks. They all have the same plot, bland one dimension characters and so on and so fourth. While this film has the general idea of a child eating clown, it definitely differs from others. The actual plot itself- a man named Kent who dresses as a clown for his sons birthday only to find that he can't rid of the costume nevertheless remove it off himself, etc, etc. That within itself gives me anxiety for the character! But, it's a different story, different characters.Speaking of, the acting was pretty good as well. You could easily get sucked into it and I felt myself feeling a bit bad for the man and his family. The characters aren't posed as over annoying nor do they make the hand-to-face choices the characters typically do to drag the plot along. The only thing was that during the middle it got a little stiff. Somewhere in between I kept looking down at my phone and getting a tiny bit distracted. I personally didn't find it scary, through the clown definitely was creepy looking with his origins and features and such. So, if your looking for more of a scary, cover your face sort of movie this isn't it. But still a good movie nonetheless!",Clown
142,mudkatz48,Scared the Hell Out of Me!!! I Hate Clowns!!!!,10,5 April 2015,"""Clowns"" is a very nicely done horror movie from Eli Roth. Though not yet released in the US, it is available from Amazon.co.uk, so those out there with Region Free players, send in your orders. Pennywise is nothing compared with the Clown in this film. The film starts nicely enough, with little Jackie's birthday party. This year he wanted a clown for his party. Who knew clowns would ever double book. Never mind, Dad to the rescue. He's a Realtor who finds an old trunk with a clown suit in it. Dad puts on clown suit and saves the party. But all too quick we learn that something is wrong with this particular clown suit. To give away anymore would be criminal. The actors and actresses are mostly unknown, but are totally believable in their roles. The exception being Peter Storemare, who turns in a really cool, and slightly unsettling performance, let's just say he's not very good with kids. Some very typical Eli Roth humour shows up in a few places. And Eli himself makes a cameo appearance as ""Frowny The Clown"", a TV show that son and father are watching at the beginning of the movie. I give ""Clown"" 10 out of 10, because it was fun to watch and scary as hell. Especially if you hate clowns and are as scared of them as I am. Possible Spoiler Alert! Kudos to the makeup and FX guys. The final version of the clown is really terrifying.",Clown
143,chrisdas79,Killer clown on the loose!,5,13 March 2015,"A film by Eli Roth. That credit itself is scary enough to make you want to watch a horror movie. So, did this movie live up to the name?Yes and No. Yes because it was a very interesting take on the origin of the clown and the whole history behind it's eventual transition to the modern day version. No because it could have been fleshed-out a little more. Anyone who's watched movies by Eli Roth knows, that he very rarely holds back. However, I couldn't help but feel that this whole movie seemed a little restrained. Almost as if he was trying to make a movie that wouldn't offend the oversensitive - but come on, Eli, that's why we have Disney. The atmosphere through this movie ended up feeling like Hannah Montana on acid.So the story revolves around a father (Kent) who wears a clown outfit for his son, Jack's birthday. The laughter turns to horror though, as that night, when Kent tries to take off the outfit, it just won't come off. Kent decides that it's not such a big problem and sleeps it off in the hopes that maybe when he wakes up, all his problems will have magically been whisked away. Much to his dismay, this proves to be far from true as the next day, he tries to remove the costume again, without any success.What we learn through the course of the movie is that the outfit, is not really an outfit but the skin of a demon which is slowly turning the goofy and terribly wooden Kent into a demon obsessed with eating children. That's right, a demon who goes after the one thing more scary than demons. Children.Being an Eli Roth movie, you can expect violence and suspense. I have to say though, the whole effort just felt very forced and the only notable performance came from Peter Stormare (who plays a man named Karlsson and happens to be an expert on clown-related horror) Peter, seems to have become an expert at switching between the role of protagonist and antagonist. It's not awful but it's not good either. It doesn't seem to have any goal in mind. It's as if three drunk people got together and said ""I know, let's make a movie about clowns. Also, let's make sure it isn't really that good"" So it ends up landing in the ""Meh"" pile.Would I recommend it? Well that depends... Did you lose a bet? Are you looking for ways to waste your time? Do you have a clinically diagnosed obsession with clowns? If so, then look no further! This is the movie for you!",Clown

The actors did a fine job of portraying some surprisingly well written characters while the storyline moved along at a good, steady pace.Although this film has its fair share of Gore, it doesn't turn into a mindless slaughterfest that so many similar movies resort to. Granted, it's not as deep as ""It"", or ""The Last Circus"", but it does touch on more than one moral dilemma, as well as a couple of interpersonal conflicts between characters.Enough about the ""drama"" aspect.

150,metzenger,Surprisingly good,8,12 August 2019,"My wife and I enjoy watching horror movies primarily to laugh at them and make fun of the bad executions of terrible ideas. We went into this expecting the same, a never heard of low budget horror movie to scoff at. We ended up invested in this movie and enjoying the hell out of it! We will definitely watch it again. Clown knows it's cheesy and rolls with it. The gore is top notch and there is enough of a slow burn into the transformation that you can really enjoy the character shift. It's a dumb premise that KNOWS it's dumb and owns it wonderfully. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. More than just something to make fun of. It isn't scary at all, but it is very entertaining! I would love this movie to be on an episode of How Did This Get Made?.",Clown
151,marciacowart-43911,Very dark and Sinister,9,5 September 2017,"This movie is a must see for any horror fan. there was never a dull moment from the beginning you knew something bad was going to happen. It gives you a Wayne Gacy-Slender man feel. If you are a true horror fan I recommend watching. **Spoiler Alert** This movie is not for weak stomachs or the weak at heart, You will see a lot of blood and if you cant stomach the thought of a child being killed in a gruesome way (not that anyone should, but it can be unsettling at times to watch) this movie is not for you.",Clown
152,cassieleighart,Let's be honest...,3,4 January 2017,"... (some spoilers) This film was pretty awful from a story point of view. If you watched the trailer and have ever seen a horror movie, you'll have no trouble figuring out the loosely veiled ending. The cinematography is the only reason I rated this as a 3 rather than a 1. Visually it is a typical Hollywood horror movie akin to 'The Ring' or 'Cabin in the Woods' while lacking any originality to the story. It is a killer clown movie! Not much to expect! More backstory or actual scare factor would have gone a long way. There were lots of plot points that could have been explored further and possibly enhanced this waste of time. I think we, as a society, know that when the score drops to silence; something is going to pop out in an attempted jump scare. And gore does not equal scare! Twisty the clown from AHS: Freakshow and Pennywise from It had less screen time yet more scare factor than the clown in Clown. I honestly think this film would have been ten times better if the clown suit had 'won' rather than stereotypically defeated, not what I was expecting from Eli Roth. Cabin Fever was excellent! Looks like Roth is headed to meet M. Night at the intersection of big budget mediocrity and washed up ideas. Of course this is just my opinion, seems like a lot of people enjoyed it, I'm just not one of them.",Clown

You will if you watch this,",1,19 November 2017,"I feel like a lone voice in a sea of fake reviews.There is no way anyone--I mean ANYONE with 1% of brain cells left in their head, that would give this film a passing grade. It fails at every attempt at everything. No need for details other than DON'T BOTHER!! It's the worst of the worst.",Clown
154,mvk-58876,Prolife or prochoice?,5,6 March 2018,"I recently watched Clown and it left my torn. I'm really pro-life and I'm not sure about my position regarding this movie. I understand that the clown demon will not leave his host-body (Kent, played by Andy Powers, usually referred to as 'daddy' or affectionately babe, by the actress whats-her-face), until he has eaten poor, young souls. This brings my to my main concern. While watching I counted the clown demon killing five(!!!!) kids in total:1. Lard Ass 
2. The Kid Who does not Take no for an Answer while Offering Food
3. The Bully
4. Random Ball Pit Kid
5. Fetus(!!!!!!!!!!)This seems to convey the point, that the fetus is not a human being. This I find very disturbing. Even though the fetus has not yet devoloped fully, it is still a human being just like you and I, and should be considered as such in the movie. The question I am left with is this: is this a mistake on the writers behalf (Christopher Ford & Jon Watts) and if so, who is the writer responsible for this omission? Or could it be that this movie is, God forbid, actually is taking a pro-choice stance?! if so, I would be highly disturbed and would have no choice but to withdraw my five star rating and replace it with a one star rating.",Clown
155,chuckninja-03948,Something Wicked This way come...,10,5 July 2018,"I'm a sucker for a good Evil Clown Movie!
 Unfortunately, there are not many that hit the mark, until 'Clown' was reluctantly released. 
This was one of the films that fall under the Circus tent of ""I heard about this but when does it come out?"" 
I wondered for years, it seemed, if this would be a straight to DVD or Theatrical Release!?
When said film was finally released here in the states, I was NOT Disappointed! From start to finish it is a gory, bloody, bizarre, roller coaster of Fear and Discomfort! 
When its backed by Eli Roth, You almost can be certain it will be a bloody good time! 
The story is an original take on a Horror film (Not another Re-Boot) Transformation-Were' Clown Monster, Demons and Child Endangerment! 
This film is Intense and just all out cool! 
For all you Monster Kids and Gore-Hounds! Highly Recommended!",Clown
