0,SnoopyStyle,unique,8,19 August 2013,"I was expecting something more shocking. Don't get me wrong. This is violent and misogyny at it worst. But we've seen it all before. Especially the worldly movie reviewers that are so eager to give it a zero. If anything, it's the minimalist acting that's unique here. And not just the limited dialog but it's the movement. They don't even move that much.The minimalist acting, the over saturation of color red, the grotesque violence, the misogyny, all of it adds to a unique feel unlike anything I've seen before. Even with all its oddness, it was compelling and mesmerizing. This is like nothing I've ever seen before and that's worth something to me.",Only God Forgives
1,nogodnomasters,I'd like you to meet my mother,6,25 April 2018,"There is nothing like an oddball Thai noir film with Ryan Gosling. Ryan runs a fight club in Thailand. His older brother Billy kills a prostitute. Billy in turn is killed by the father of the dead girl, assisted by a vigilante cop (Vithaya Pansringarm). Ryan realizes his brother was no saint and doesn't enact revenge and then the over the top drug dealing potty mouthed mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) shows up to makes things worse.The main problem with this film is that Ryan's character was never developed, or developed to the point you cared about him. It was a bad role. The drug dealing, while discussed wasn't really part of the plot other than background material. The background of Billy, was told to us as was many plot points that didn't mesh well into an enjoyable tale. Kristin Scott Thomas' character carried the film for what it was worth.This film is clearly not for everyone and I give three stars for its uniqueness and potential, not the entertainment value.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word. No nudity (unless you count art). No sex. Adult themes.",Only God Forgives
2,kosmasp,Masterpiece or boring piece?,8,3 October 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn is not a predictable man. While many expected (and some reviews even suggested) that his follow up movie to Drive would be more of the same ... it's not! It's not like, if you loved Drive, you'll like/love his new movie too. While the coloring might be in the same area (code), it does not have many more similarities. It is closer to Valhalla Rising than Drive.Of course having Ryan Gosling starring in this does help. Also the other actors are really great. Whether they're speaking (rare occasions) or just stare at each other, beautifully lit, their charisma comes across. Yes the movie does move slow, but it also tries to take a simple theme of ""Revenge"" and make more out of it. Stylizing it, but not necessarily the violence it holds. There is a lot of violence, too much for some surely. But I won't convince people to watch something they don't wanna see. And I wouldn't want that ... because everyone has their own taste in movies. Decide for yourself if this is something you want to watch (either by looking at the Trailer or renting it and watching the first 10 minutes or less, if you don't like it)",Only God Forgives
3,lee_eisenberg,too confusing,5,28 October 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn first came to my attention when I saw his 1996 movie ""Pusher"", about a drug-dealing ring in Denmark. I didn't see any more of his movies until I saw ""Only God Forgives"", starring Ryan Gosling as a man running a drug-smuggling operation in Thailand whose mother wants him to kill the men who killed his brother. The interesting thing about the movie is that the indoor scenes have a red tint, creating a surreal feeling. Unfortunately, that doesn't compensate for the movie's vagueness. It's as though hardly anything happens in the movie. I could barely understand the plot. Gosling did a lot better in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (which plays with the audience), while Kristin Scott Thomas fared much better in ""Sarah's Key"". This is just not a movie that I feel inclined to recommend.",Only God Forgives
4,jboothmillard,Only God Forgives,5,9 May 2020,"I recognised this title, because I had missed it being shown on television so many times, I knew the leading actor in it and that it was rated well by critics, so when I finally got the opportunity to watch, I went for it, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Drive, The Neon Demon). Basically, Julian Thompson (Ryan Gosling) is an American, living with his older brother Billy (Strike's Tom Burke) in Bangkok, Thailand, who runs a Muay Thai boxing club, as a front for drug dealing. He is a quiet man with a troubled past. One night, Billy rapes and kills an underage prostitute and is cornered by Thai police. Lieutenant Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) allows the girl's father, Choi Yan Lee (Kovit Wattanakul), to exact his vengeance on Billy however he wants. He chooses to beat Billy to death, but he also cuts off Choi's forearm for allowing his daughter to be a prostitute in the first place. During a session with Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam), Julian's favourite prostitute, he has a vision of himself meeting Chang in a dark room, where Chang cuts off his hands. After discovering his brother was murdered, Julian and his crew go to confront Choi, but Julian ultimately decides to spare Choi's life. Julian's mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), arrives in Bangkok, and demands that Julian finds and kills the men responsible for Billy's death. She is infuriated when Julian refuses, saying he believes Choi was justified in avenging the death of his daughter. After having Choi killed, Crystal learns of Chang's involvement. She meets with rival drug dealer Byron (Byron Gibson), offering him a cut of her drug dealing operation if he will put out a hit on Chang. The police arrive at Julian's club investigating Choi's murder, but Chang concludes that Julian is not the killer. Julian recognises Chang from his visions and follows him, but he seems to disappear before Julian can catch up to him. That evening, Julian brings Mai to meet Crystal, but Crystal recognises that Mai is not his girlfriend, he insults her being a prostitute, and demeans Julian, saying he is sexually inferior to his dead brother. Julian does not react to his mother's verbal abuse, but after they leave, he viciously humiliates Mai, by making her remove her dress in public. Two gunmen on motorbikes are sent to kill Chang at a restaurant, several customers and a couple of Chang's men are killed in the ensuing shoot-out. Chang kills one of the assassins and pursues and apprehends the other. The surviving gunman leads Chang to his boss, Li Po (Danai Thiengdham), who arranges assassination contracts to provide for his disabled son. Chang kills the gunman but spares Li Po after seeing his affection for his son. Chang then finds Byron and tortures him to reveal who ordered the hit. Julian confronts Chang and challenges him to a fight at Julian's boxing venue. But Chang is an experienced boxer and quickly beats him. Afterwards, Crystal knows Chang has figured out she ordered the hits and is fearful for her life. She pleads with Julian to kill Chang, reminding him that he killed his own father for her. She promises that after Julian kills Chang, they will return home, and she will be a true mother to him. With his associate Charlie Ling (Nophand Boonyai), Julian infiltrates Chang's home, shooting his guard dead, intent on ambushing Chang when he returns. Charlie informs Julian that Crystal wants Chang's entire family executed. Charlie murders the nanny of Chang's daughter as she enters the home, but Julian kills Charlie before he can murder Chang's daughter. Chang and a police officer find Crystal at her hotel. She explains how Julian killed his father with his bare hands, asserting that Julian is violent and deranged, blaming him for the violent crimes committed. Chang decides to punish her by slitting her throat. Later, Julian returns to the hotel and finds his mother dead. In silence, he approaches her body and cuts open her abdomen before placing his hand inside of the wound. Julian is last seen standing in a field with Chang, who appears to cut off both of Julian's hands with his sword, as seen in his dream. Also starring Gordon Brown as Gordon, Sahajak Boonthanakit as Kim and Pitchawat Petchayahon as Phaiban. Gosling gives a pretty good performance as the quiet and tormented drug smuggler, and Scott Thomas is fantastic as the sinister mother who wants those who killed her son to pay. This is one of those stylish films that will confuse, bore, or alienate those watching, the use of colour, dark lighting and camerawork is very intriguing, the electronic score by Cliff Martinez is cool, and the violence is eye-catching, the story set in the criminal underworld just about holds up as well, an interesting crime thriller. Worth watching!",Only God Forgives
5,Tweekums,Ultra-stylish revenge thriller from Nicolas Winding Refn,9,18 December 2019,"This film, from director Nicolas Winding Refn, is set in the Bangkok underworld where a tale of revenge is about to play out. Julian runs a boxing club, which is a front for his mother's drug empire. One day he learns that his brother has been murdered... it turns out he had raped and murdered a teenaged girl and police officer Lieutenant Chang has allowed the girl's father to extract his revenge. Julian's mother is determined to have her own revenge against the father and Chang. Before the story is over several more people will die.This is one of those films where a fairly average score is highly misleading... there is nothing average about it but it is a film one is likely to love or hate. Everything looks very stylish with lighting and colour schemes where I'm sure every detail was carefully decided upon. At times the action loves at a slow pace... literally the characters move slowly; I was never bored though. The characters might not have great depth, nor are they particularly sympathetic but they are intriguing. The acting is great; most notably from Ryan Gosling, Vithaya Pansringarm and Kristin Scott Thomas as Julian, Chang and Julian's mother. As one might expect Refn there are moments of extreme, disturbing violence that is likely to have most viewers wincing... I certainly did at times! Overall I'd say that this won't be for everybody but I'd still recommend it to anybody wanting something very stylish that leaves one thinking.",Only God Forgives
6,BA_Harrison,Quite possibly the most tedious revenge movie ever made.,1,1 June 2014,"Drive, the previous movie from director Nicholas Winding Refn and actor Ryan Gosling, utilised a deliberate and rather stilted style that not only resulted in a unique air of cool but which also had the effect of making the movie's explosive scenes of violence more impactful. In Only God Forgives, Refn and Gosling repeat this sparing, slow-burn technique, but take it to the nth degree; this time around the effect is to completely bore the crap out of the viewer.Quite simply, Only God forgives has got to be one of the most excruciating exercises in cinema it has ever been my misfortune to witness. Every pan, track or zoom is agonisingly drawn out, the camera movement often being almost imperceptible. A good percentage of scenes comprise of corridors, or people not moving, or people moving very slowly, or karaoke performances (slow songs, of course). Virtually every scene is lit in either red or blue, which gets extremely irritating. Gosling's brooding expression remains the same throughout the entire film. Conversations take an age to unfold. Minutes seem like hours. Hours seem like days. Time eventually loses all meaning.Even the film's few scenes of brutal violence are shot in such a way as to render them totally boring.Art-house types will love the film (or at least pretend to), finding hidden meaning and symbolism in its languorous plot and mind-bogglingly dull execution, but most right-minded people will quite rightly dismiss this for the utter garbage that it is.",Only God Forgives
7,paul_haakonsen,Seriously?...,3,17 December 2015,"Reading the synopsis for this movie made it seem like a movie that would actually be quite alright. But wow, was I in for a rude awakening as this movie trotted on in a painfully slow pace with a storyline that was equally devoid of life and energy as the acting by the people performing in the movie.The story is about two brothers in Thailand, whom are involved with some shady business. When one of them is killed, the other brother sets out to seek vengeance.Right, well, the storyline was simple and straight forward, but it was killed most horribly by the hands of director Nicolas Winding Refn. It was so slow paced that it was unbearable and there was too much focus on totally irrelevant things; such as the unfathomably dull sex scenes.I think this was actually my first Ryan Gossling movie, or at least I don't remember him from any other movie that I might have seen. I can't claim to be impressed with the performance that he delivered in ""Only God Forgives"".""Only God Forgives"" was a dull experience and it was painful to suffer through en endless tirade of random and pointless shots taking place in an equally pointless storyline.",Only God Forgives
8,LeonLouisRicci,A Beautiful Looking Ugly Film,7,11 December 2013,"There is much Ugliness amongst the Beauty. A meticulously Photographed Film, it is not one for the Masses. It is an Art Film for Art Film Lovers and makes no Pretense to be anything but. It also has the Audacity to have one of the current Mainstream Pretty Boys and Fan Favorites Ryan Gosling as the Lead and it is His Fans that will be the most Disappointed in this thing that reeks of Underground.Every Scene is Photographed as though it were some sort of come on Tourist Trap for Decadent Westerners to take the plunge and visit the Ultimate in Decadence Bangkok, Thailand. Deserved or not the place has that kind of Rep that precedes it. This is a foul mouthed, bloody, exercise in Style and not much else. It is attractively repulsive from the get go and will have some demanding Their money back and others seeking Therapy. It is the Dark Side that is on display here but is Framed like the Bright Side.A revenge Flick for the hardened that has an Alternative Comic Book look and feel. The fact that Ryan Gosling has literally nothing to say in the Movie maybe the Actors way of saying that anyone who ever took me as a real talent, well, the jokes on You. This is what I do best.

9,CinemaSerf,What is this?,6,19 March 2021,"Now no-one sports a waistcoat better than a dapper Ryan Gosling, but even that sartorial skill is nowhere near enough to rescue this from cinematic oblivion... An implausibly cast Kristin Scott-Thomas arrives at her sons' Bangkok club after her other son is murdered. Turns out that he had killed someone who had avenged the murder of his daughter and so a disgruntled police officer with a samurai sword had done for him. She orders revenge, and the whole rather dreary thing lurches - with a desperate paucity of dialogue - towards a conclusion that can have made absolutely no sense to anyone not involved in the production. Gosling is at his most enigmatic, loads of lingering and loving photography as he has to pit his wits, and is fists, against his lethal., karaoke singing, protagonist ""Chang"" (Vithaya Pansringarm). The direction certainly has a style to it and the lighting creates a wonderfully seedy and plausible environment - as does the graphically depicted brutality - but the story is just, well, lacking. God may, indeed, be the only one who forgives - but that's always assuming that he cared, though - I didn't.",Only God Forgives

11,grantss,"Pretentious, ponderous, pointless revenge-drama",3,22 August 2014,"Pretentious, ponderous, pointless revenge-drama. Had some potential but it immediately becomes obvious that the movie is nothing more than a vehicle for director Nicolas Winding Refn to showcase his array of slow, lingering camera shots. Every scene gets stretched out to the max in a massive display of self-indulgence.You wouldn't know the movie is only 90 minutes long, it moves so slowly. Strip away the pretentious padding and the movie would only be about 50 minutes long...And, after all this, there is no point. The movie ends with nothing accomplished and nothing said.It does spark to life occasionally, but these brief flutters just make it worse. They make you think that the movie is at last going to kick up a gear, but instead it then just subsides back into its morass of pretentious gimmickry. Whole experience seemed very David Lynch-like (not a good thing), except that if this was a David Lynch movie it would have been at least an hour longer...The only plus is that the cinematography is great. Good use of light and dark, especially red on black.In keeping with the slow, pretentious theme, dialogue is kept to a minimum. This was also a feature in Drive, but it was far less irritating there. Like in Drive, Ryan Gosling is the main beneficiary of the lack of dialogue, hardly having to say more than a handful of sentences in the whole movie. I guess he was hired for his looks...Performance of the movie goes to Kristen Scott Thomas, who has a bit of dialogue, and what dialogue it is! Hardly the cutesy, schmaltzy role we're accustomed to see her in. Very gritty.The stunningly beautiful Yayaying Rhatha Phongam might be about the only reason to see this movie.Longest 90 minutes of my life...",Only God Forgives
12,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,1,22 June 2021,"Only God Forgives is weird, empty and abstract.Silence, murder and karaoke, leaving the viewer throughout the film questioning WHY? With little characterization and dialogue, often long blank stares, similar to Gosling's expressionless ""First Man"" performance. It's dull and vile mostly.",Only God Forgives
13,phd_travel,Only a fan could forgive,1,29 August 2013,"Face it if you are a Ryan Gosling fan you will probably see this movie despite all the bad things said about it (most of which are justified). Basic premise: a pedophile rapist murders a young Thai prostitute in Bangkok. He gets killed and his mother (Thomas) wants his brother (Gosling) to avenge the death. A few pointers on how to sit through this cinematic abomination. 1. Accept the flaws of this movie. The story isn't confusing surprisingly - but it is stupid. There isn't a single feel good aspect of the plot period. Ryan doesn't say much or change his expression - he walks around slowly or sits there staring a lot. You won't find any love, passion or character depth.2. Cover your eyes at the right times It is sickeningly violent, so cover your eyes during the torture and killing scenes - you will know when they are coming - watch out when the knives come out.3. Laugh out loud at the comedy Look on it as a comedy led by Kristin Scott Thomas in cheap white trash get up with long blond hair, heavy eye make up and age inappropriate dresses. She is so unrecognizable as the mother from hell. Plus the terrible dialog she has to deliver - just laugh. The Thai singing is hilarious. So is Ryan's dapper outfit during his fight with the cop.4. Appreciate the lesson. Although Bangkok is negatively portrayed as a hellish dump of murder and prostitution, at least it serves as a warning for foreigners behaving badly in Bangkok - you will be punished. Plus the Thai super cop is a refreshing anti stereotype. To compensate for showing Thai women as prostitutes the movie lets a middle aged Thai man beat up the white hero.5. Don't expect anything as good as Drive Overall the stylish photography and effective soundtrack of Drive hardly figure here. So put aside expectations of a follow up in style or substance.Some advice for Ryan - part ways from this Danish director.",Only God Forgives
14,gradyharp,'Time to meet the devil.',8,20 July 2013,"Controversial as this film already is (the critics hate it, those who have watched it either hate or love it), it is a solid stretch of cinematic art by writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn. He is an artist who challenges audiences and takes enormous risks: his 1996 film, the extremely violent and uncompromising PUSHER became a cult phenomenon and won Refn instant international critical acclaim. That was followed by BLEEDER and the now cult classic DRIVE. Each of these films is highly stylized and focuses on introverted reactions to outward situations. ONLY GOD FORGIVES pushes those traits even further: completely set in Thailand it weighs in on Asian symbolism, spiritualism and response to revenge or own hand rights. It is very dark, both in the cinematography of Larry Smith and in the ever-present veneer of killing and death and mutilation. The entire film is a study in color manipulation, slow movement (as in Noh theater), minimal dialog, and even more minimal character development. And yet somehow Refn makes all of this work to his advantage to hold the audience, as though imprisoned, to examine the extents of evil.The setting is Bangkok. Ten years ago Julian (Ryan Gosling) killed a man and went on the run. Now he manages a Thai boxing club as a front for a drugs operation. Respected in the criminal underworld, deep inside, he feels empty. When Julian's brother Billy (Tom Burke) murders an underage prostitute, the police call on retired cop Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) - the Angel of Vengeance whose other obsession is Karaoke singing. Chang allows the father to kill his daughter's murderer, then 'restores order' by chopping off the man's right hand. Julian's mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) - the foul-mouthed nasty head of a powerful criminal organization - arrives in Bangkok to collect her favorite first son's body. She charges Julian to find his killers and 'raise hell'. Despite being beaten severely in a fight with Chang, Julian's inability to react to anything - even to the physical relationship with a strange girl Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) - leads to mayhem that in many ways does not even seem to affect him.The casting is strange: obviously Ryan Gosling was hired for the role of Julian because of his works with Reyn in DRIVE. He is called upon to do very little and as a result we are not able to appreciate his motivation or his presence in the story. Kristin Scott Thomas is a brilliant actress but here she is merely a source of filthy accusations and Kabuki-like poses. The star of the film is Vithaya Pansringarm, and even though we loathe him and his malicious manner he alone gives us an idea of why he is doing what he is doing, framing it all with obnoxious Karaoke singing in a garish nightclub. Everything about the film is slow and dark and yet for some obscure reason it works. Grady Harp",Only God Forgives
15,zetes,"Partly terrible, partly masterful; in the end, I quite liked it",8,28 July 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn follows up his most mainstream hit, Drive, with one of the craziest, most non-commercial films imaginable. It's somehow simultaneously one of the most laughable pieces of crap and one of the weirdest, wildest, gorgeous films I've ever seen. In Bangkok, Ryan Gosling's brother (Tom Burke) is murdered after killing a 16 year-old prostitute. Their mother (Kristen Scott Thomas) arrives in town demanding that Gosling take revenge for his brother, but Gosling has misgivings about it. Thomas hires some thugs who go after the perpetrator, a middle-aged police captain (Vithaya Pansringarm). Pansringarm is kind of a psycho, and when the attempt is made on his life, he goes full force after those responsible. It's all very minimal, and it moves at a glacial pace. It's often extremely silly, especially when Kristen Scott Thomas is on screen. She chews the scenery like crazy. Gosling reportedly only has 22 lines in the entire picture (it is thankfully short, running 90 minutes) and really doesn't have much presence, unlike in Drive, where he shined. Pansringarm is a ridiculous villain, an nonthreatening, pudgy 50 year-old Asian man who likes to sing karaoke. All of it is quite humorous, and it's so not supposed to be. You can tell Refn is dead serious about this whole endeavor, which makes it all the more funny. So, it's entertaining for those reasons. But it does a couple of things right, and that makes it something quite intriguing. The cinematography, first and foremost, is just breathtaking. The whole film is bathed in red and blue neon light, and the framing is often startling. I also love Cliff Martinez's score. This film is a huge disaster, but it's an enormously fun one. Yeah, most will definitely hate it (the pacing is going to be brutal for a wide swath of the audience), but it's going to be a cult classic, for sure.",Only God Forgives
16,siderite,What was the point of this film?,7,14 October 2013,"I know that Ryan Gosling's specialty lately is the silent character in an atmospheric movie, but this is just ridiculous. In this Danish French production which takes place in Bangkok and features American actors, most of the scenes are silent, with loud moody music in the background and with disturbing levels of violence. The problem with this film is that its violence is its sole reason for being. Refn teams again with Gosling, but the result is a different film from Drive, which was a far better movie. Perhaps Refn should stick to directing only.In the film you get this really dysfunctional American family with ties to the Thai underground and a local cop with a God complex who treats every crime with what he believes is the appropriate level of punishment. Even if he is respected in his community, he isn't saner than the Americans. The conflict between them isn't even a real one, there is no right or wrong, righteous or vile, just a bunch of people who more or less decide to kill each other for no good reason than their own brand of insanity. And then it is all over. Of course, being an artsy movie, the idea behind it is much more complex, with the cop acting as ""God"" and the depraved mother as the ""Devil"". But more than a religious allegory to be good a movie needs.I can't say I regret watching the film, I didn't really have anything else better to do, but it is as slow as a snail and as pointless as it is insane. Well done, though. I know it sounds weird, but even if I don't agree with its strategy, the movie's production was very good, with good direction and good acting all around. It's just that at the end I couldn't help asking myself: what was the point?",Only God Forgives
17,StevePulaski,"""This could've possibly been repaired if either the actors or the writers had something to say""",3,19 July 2013,"I've had three separate debates with people over the last few months about Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers. All three times it has been me trying to justify its social/cultural importance as a film and state explicitly why its message is true and needs to be heard. All three times, I felt as if I was talking into a megaphone to a crowd of deaf people. It seemed as if they already made up their minds as to what Spring Breakers was and felt no need to hear other viewpoints.Well, now here's Nicholas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives, and, this time around, I won't be having any verbose debates about the content of the picture and its significance/impact because, frankly, there doesn't seem to be much. This is an art-house film that will be considered ""profound"" and ""deep"" by those who likely haven't watched an art-house film before. I have a strong feeling that if that is the case, many will go back to this years from now after, hopefully, having watched more pictures of this kind, and when they revisit this one, they can see how lifeless and artificial most of the film is.The film's plot is beyond basic. Set in the seamy whorehouses of Thailand, the central ""character"" is Julian (Ryan Gosling), who runs a boxing club down in the area. After his brother is killed for beating and, eventually, killing an underage prostitute, Julian's mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) comes down to Thailand immediately to try and convince her surviving son to avenge his sibling's death. But Julian is something of a pacifist, unmotivated to kill anybody associated to his brother's murder because he believes he got what he deserved. This upsets Julian's mother, whose foul-mouthed, Neanderthalic ways only become worse after that.From there on out, the film is less a film and more an evocative montage of people staring at one another, sometimes saying a sentence or two, or engaging in senselessly violent acts, all of which are usually captured in deep neon hues. Almost everyone of these scenes are plastic in the sense that they seem so dedicated to trapping the viewer in a room void of connection. Refn doesn't make any attempt to create or illustrate character, which would be fine if he would give us a setup mildly interesting (or illustrated a welcoming impressionistic style). But instead, he gives us a setup that doesn't even seem to be taken seriously by the characters and actors themselves.It's hard to talk about performances when the actors seem to have very little to work it, too. Ryan Gosling is a strong leading man and, coming off of The Place Beyond the Pines, where he played a troubled but focused father with a woman who can't stand him, I was sort of expecting he'd move past his recent foray into playing a brooding archetype. Gosling simply broods in this film and nothing more, saying few words and scarcely stringing a sentence together. At this point, Gosling is beginning to venture into the area of self-parody, which is the last place a spry, young talent would want to find himself. More, it's not necessarily the fact that Kristin Scott Thomas gives a bad performance, she just gives one that feels misplaced and too blunt for a film clearly trying to maintain a minimalist charisma about its ways.Two things are slightly mesmerizing about Only God Forgives - that is - until redundancy breeds contempt. The first is the cinematography by Larry Smith, which sometimes entirely consumes the screen in an attempt to seemingly distract the audience to show the film isn't as empty as it really is. The second is the luscious, ambient score by Cliff Martinez, which always seems to kick in at the right place and right time. The combined efforts of both a lovely atmosphere and a memorable score save Only God Forgives from unforeseeable drudgery, and yet, the entire thing still feels like a gigantic missed opportunity.Much as been made about the violence of the picture, some saying it emphasizes some sort of metaphorical aspect of the picture and others saying it's simply used as shock value. I side on those who claim it's shock value; in a way, everything in Only God Forgives is used as a piece of trite shock value. From the foul-mouthed mother who does everything from call out a prostitute to recount an incestuous past, to romanticizing and fetishizing its violence into mindless bloodiness. I look at films like Fight Club and am astonished at how they fit in commentary on manhood and textbook masculinity in a picture ostensibly devoted to grown men beating the hell out of each other. I look at films like Only God Forgives and am astonished they could even stand from the ground up on the thin material they're crafted on.Writer/director Nicholas Winding Refn finally received some mainstream attention and credibility when his film Drive took people by surprise in 2011. People regarded it as a quiet, but ambitious masterpiece with Gosling going full-force as the quiet lead in the picture. Now, Refn follows up with one of the most tiring films in sometime, one that feels so forced and unable to produce anything of significance that we, as the viewers, could potentially extract. I see Only God Forgives becoming the go-to film for young cinephiles, anxious to deviate from the cinematic conventions into something new and bold. They will likely find it exhilarating and remarkable because they'll feel it's saying something they can't pinpoint, which is very rare in Hollywood films. As someone who has made a priority out of seeking out lesser-known films over the years, I find Only God Forgives nearly impossible to believe on an impressionistic, independent frontier, and inconceivably brooding (like its character) when trying to exist on Hollywood ground. This could've possibly been repaired if either the actors or the writers had something to say.",Only God Forgives
18,KineticSeoul,Very self-indulget film that is maybe worth seeing just once...,6,23 July 2013,"Now I thought ""Drive"" is a great art-house film(pretty sure a lot of reviews for this movie starts out like that) and I don't know if the success of that one got to Nicolas Winding Refn head. But this is a very self-indulgent movie, a lot of art-house films are. But this one has a lot of the forced artistic moments in it to the point it really drags the movie down. Nicolas Winding Refn said in a interview if ""Drive"" is a cocaine than ""Only God Forgives"" is like going on acid. Now I haven't done those drugs but this is a trippy film. With hellish visual style with neon lights. But just because a film is weird or even messed up doesn't necessarily equal greatness. This film is so slow moving, not when it comes to the story but by the frame by frame direction and character movements it gets kind of irritating sometimes. Nicolas Winding Refn likes to make his characters stare at each other or at inanimate objects for a long period of time. And he really does use those moments a lot in this film. In another words this movie is a hour and a half long but could have easily been just a hour and have gotten the story across. This can kind of be considered a sequel for ""Drive"". But Nicolas Winding Refn relinquished what was good about ""Drive"" and tries to do something new. Since he basically funded this whole movie, he had the freedom to do whatever he wanted which is ballsy. But he cared so much about imagery(which is well shot) but seemed to have lost focus on entertaining or even engrossing the audience and getting there attention. With a direction and elements that can grab the audiences, while having that artistic edge. And when it comes to the art style direction it didn't seem all that original either(even if it's well shot) and gets predictable. This isn't a good film but isn't a terrible one either, I might want to see this one again but the super slow pacing makes me think otherwise. Ryan Gosling is in this and he does a good job of bringing out this maybe crazy, quite, stoic, vulnerable and yet tough guy character. In another words the similar character he played in ""Drive"". In another words he has very very very few lines. There is no hero in this story, everyone is after vengeance and money and that basically sums up this story(with a bunch of metaphors thrown in about crime and punishment). Again this movie isn't so bad that it isn't watchable but I guess one watch is enough. I am glad this one came after ""Drive"" or maybe the film ""Drive"" wouldn't have even come about. Although Nicolas Winding Refn wrote the script for ""Only God Forgives"" before he decided to take on ""Drive"".6.3/10",Only God Forgives
19,Hellmant,Entirely about (and breathes) violence!,10,26 July 2013,"'ONLY GOD FORGIVES': Five Stars (Out of Five)A misunderstood masterpiece from writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling. Refn also co-wrote and directed the violent biographical crime drama 'BRONSON' (which is another masterpiece) and the violent viking film 'VALHALLA RISING' (which I haven't seen yet) as well as directed the cinephile loved violent crime drama 'DRIVE' (which also starred Gosling and is a near-masterpiece). Refn definitely has a thing for violence but he doesn't glorify it in any way; he actually depicts it exactly how it actually is in life (the darkest and most disturbing part of human nature). With this movie he takes his fascination with violence even one step further, by making a film that is entirely about (and breathes) violence. It's resulted in extremely mixed and polarizing results from critics and movie lovers (which is usually the sign of a great film). I for one love it!Refn describes the film as a 'fairy tale' and a 'western' set in the modern-day Far East. It's a French-Danish film shot entirely in Bangkok, Thailand. It's filled with subtitles mostly and Gosling has almost no lines in the entire movie. He plays yet another brooding and conflicted anti-hero who's such a soft-spoken 'man of few words' that he almost appears to be a mute. How Gosling can constantly play such creepy, insane and silent characters and still have girls adore him is amazing! It really shows how important looks are in our superficial world. The film also stars Kristin Scott Thomas and Vithaya Pansringarm. Gosling plays a former American, named Julian, who now lives in Bangkok smuggling drugs with his brother, Billy (Tom Burke), under the front of a boxing club. As the movie opens Billy rapes and murders a 16-year-old prostitute and is caught red-handed in the hotel room he did it in by the Thai police. Lieutenant Chang (Pansringarm) shows up at the scene and exacts his own brand of revenge by bringing the girl's father, Choi Yan Lee (Kovit Wattanakul), to the scene of the crime and allowing him to do what he wants to Billy. He then cuts off Choi's arm as punishment for allowing his young daughter to live in such a dangerous and sinful way. Julian and his business associates then get a hold of Choi but before Julian shoots him Choi explains what happened. Julian feels compassion for the man (as well as understanding for why he did what he did) and lets him go but then his domineering and psychotic crime lord mother (Thomas) arrives in town and 'all hell breaks loose'.The movie is most impressive in how dream like it all feels (it feels like a nightmare but still a very vivid and realistic one). Refn definitely has skills in this area and this is probably his most impressive visual and stylistic cinematic achievement yet. I think Gosling is a good actor (in the right role) but in movies like this (and Refn's 'DRIVE') there's not really much required of him (still he is a strong cinematic presence though). Thomas chews up the scenery in every scene she's in and Pansringarm is a very memorable villain as well (if you think of his character that way). I enjoy movie violence but despise it in life and don't think one has anything to do with the other (in a cause-and-effect way). Movies should be a reflection of life (at least in some ways) and this film definitely reflects the increasingly violent (and more racist) times we live in. It's a time when (some) of the powers that be argue more violence is the answer to violence; that everyone should be armed and whoever acts first is justified. Creeps can hunt down and murder kids (if they're of color) and legally get away with it. These are the times we live in and this movie very much reflects that. I understand the controversy surrounding the film's violence but don't think it's an immoral movie in that way at all. Years ago I wouldn't have respected a film like this because I wouldn't have understood it. It very much resembles (but is superior to) many of the films of David Lynch's career (which I've never liked but saw at a different time). The violence (as over the top as it all is) is definitely necessary in this movie and if you can sit through it it's definitely a worthwhile experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQkUJbRVsoM",Only God Forgives
20,thesar-2,The Top Twenty-Four Things Only God Forgives Made Me Ponder,1,28 July 2013,"1. Maybe God should start with everyone involved in this film.2. Also, speaking of God, it had to be a miracle Director Nicolas Winding Refn made a measly 90 minutes feel like 210 more.3. And the only time 90 minutes feels this long and drawn out, is when it's an hour and a half before my work shift ends.4. When your mother compares your dick size to your brother's, you know something more than diaper changes happened in that family.5. Drive now seems like an action-packed movie.6. Reaching your hand into the stomach of your dead mother's corpse seems like an odd way to find out if you're still an only child after your only sibling just passed.7. Gangsta moms never seem to travel with protection.8. Characters throughout a movie that relentlessly stare off into space is a Twilight movie trait and should never, ever, be duplicated.9. During a fight scene, audiences would much rather see a statue – repeatedly – than the actual fight.10. Now, I know where those incredibly slow movie theatre concession stand employees get acting gigs.11. When a 90-minute movie's singular highlight is a split-second Go-Go Boys scene, it's time to start googling something else instead of watching all of this. And by ""something,"" I mean12. Red is the new bland.13. Random is the new Indie Film.14. I'm bailing on a director if he tells me to walkasslowasIpossibly can into a scene. Ain't nobody got time for that.15. Bangkok isn't even that when all they feature are depressed strippers at their clubs.16. ""Here, seek justice, but I will take your hand for doing as I say"" is the logic here.17. It wouldn't surprise me if Ryan Gosling really did get beat up for real in this movie and that was just from his fans. Or, even, his mother. I would.18. Since Gosling barely spoke during this movie, did he adhere to the old phrase: ""If you don't have anything nice to say""19. 5-mintues for an interrogation scene should only occur in real life, not in the movies.20. Karaoke never sounded sobad. And Bill Murray lost his Oscar?21. Kristen Wiig was in this? Oh, sorry, that's just Kristin Scott Thomas's terrible wig.22. When you say: ""I'm checking out"" to a hotel clerk in Thailand, it means you're checking in. Is it reversed from America, like the side of the road you drive on there?23. God had nothing to do with this movie and wishes His name be removed. In a completely unrelated story, The Book of Revelation has just been bumped up thanks to Only God Forgives.24. Impatient people should never see a Refn film. I've learned my lesson. Sadly, it took two times.",Only God Forgives

22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Basically fails where Drive succeeded, by being too deep and lost in itself",4,24 February 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe murder of a prostitute in Bangkok sparks a chain of events that leads to Julian (Ryan Gosling) the brother of the guilty man, being sent on a mission of vengeance when his brother is killed in retribution. But when he learns the circumstances behind his death, it casts things in a different light. But then he learns the reasons behind his brother's death may not be as clear cut as they seemed.Nicolas Winding Refn introduced the style he used in his native Danish films to such great effect to Hollywood with Drive, which showed things in a different light whilst also having a well written, intricate story behind it to keep the masses amused. But with Only God Forgives, it's like everything got lost in translation, an overly stylistic, bewildering spectacle that will leave you lost.Gosling plays moreorless the same character from Drive, a rarely speaking heavy presence who causes a bigger effect by talking when he does as a result. But in the lead role, he's probably the biggest part of the whole pretentious, subversively art-house feel, just as much as co stars Kristin Scott Thomas as his bitchy mother being more forthright about vengeance and Vithaya Pansringarm as a karaoke singing mob boss, who provides the film with it's most subliminal moments. While comparisons with Drive should be kept to a minimum, it's impossible not to note how well that film converted to mainstream audiences while this feels so out of tandem. **",Only God Forgives
23,bowmanblue,Warning: know what you're getting before you watch this,4,2 July 2014,"'Only God Forgives' is one of those 'Marmite films.' Basically, you'll either love it or hate it. I daresay there are few with feelings in between those two ends of the scale.Some will say that it's a beautiful, arty masterpiece. Others will simply label it dull and boring. Basically, it's both and neither. How you perceive it will largely depend on how much you like these types of films.It's billed as a 'revenge thriller.' That may not sit well with some people as they may feel a bit mislead. If 'revenge thriller' makes you think of plenty of action and fast-paced car chases, you are severely far from the mark. Yes, it's about revenge, but it's more of an 'art-piece' than an all-out action thriller.The scenes are slow, filled with painstakingly long shots of characters as the camera pans backwards. Every shot has been crafted to perfection, primarily utilising colours and lighting, over snappy dialogue. Plus, if you're watching it for the film's leading man, Ryan Gosling, you may need to know that in the ninety minutes the film runs for, he only has about twenty-two lines to say.Basically, don't expect action and thrills (even though it's labelled a 'thriller'), expect violent art and understated performances. If you can live with that, you'll love it. If that doesn't sound like your ideal way to spend an hour and a half then it's probably best to steer well clear.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Only God Forgives

These are same people who occasionally stop on the way home to hug a tree. This writer will look you in the eye and tell you that this is a film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever that should never have been made. Or alternatively, those that made it should be banned from ever working in the industry again. Don't even know where to start. How about the fact that the story is based on seeking revenge against a cop who ""bent the rules of justice"" to his own will and assisted in the early ""execution"" of a suspect by allowing the father of the girl the suspect had killed into the same room with him. Deliberately. Now, in the piece of insanity that passes here for a script, the brother of the murderer who himself was murdered by the father of the girl he killed looks for revenge. That's the movie. There yuh go, I just saved you the misery of watching it. The really astonishing thing is that Ryan Gosling stars. What, a gambling debt? No offers from Hollywood? I confess I have no explanation for this and I usually have an explanation for everything. My best guess is that he did it on a bet and figured it could not hurt his career because no one would ever see it. And it was a easy gig, not much dialog. The most memorable tag from the film is when the mother (of Ryans character) flies in to see the body of her (other) sun, and demands an explanation as to how this happened.

This is the same writer and director of that movie and the style and feel are almost identical. For those that haven't seen Drive, this movie is very slow moving and deliberate with the dialog.

30,sol-,The Neon Devil,6,9 February 2017,"Marketed with the tagline 'Time to Meet the Devil', this enigmatic crime drama tracks the experiences of a young drug smuggler who avenges his brother's brutal murder with an awareness that he will later be judged for his vengeful actions. The film comes from the hands of Nicolas Winding Refn and much like his later 'The Neon Demon', this earlier film is visually arresting the whole way through with vivid, supersaturated colours, foreboding shadows and plenty of neon. The basic plot is likewise hardly straightforward but in a way this adds to the experience with animosity and tension in the air between characters accentuated by the lack of exposition and dialogue; in fact, lead actor Ryan Gosling has less than twenty lines of dialogue. Gosling is not, however, as solid as Elle Fanning in 'The Neon Demon'. He is cold, distant and aloof throughout, almost unmoved by his mother's outbursts and insults. This in turn renders him a very hard character to relate to. Kristin Scott Thomas on the other hand is very well cast as the overbearing matriarch, stealing every single scene she is in with her utter audacity and willingness to make it perfectly clear that her other (dead) son was her favourite. So why is Gosling so dedicated to her? At one point, he bluntly states ""she's my mother"" as justification, but is that enough? One thing is sure: this is just about the strangest film one is ever likely to come across about a son's dedication to his mother. It is a movie that looks and sounds great, but clearly not something for all tastes",Only God Forgives
31,tomgillespie2002,"Tries to antagonise its audience, but ends up simply insulting them",4,5 December 2013,"After the surprising success, both critically and commercially, of 2011's Drive, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn has furthered his auteur aspirations with his difficult follow-up, Only God Forgives. Refn admitted in an interview that he gets a kick out of screen violence to an almost fetishistic degree, and, like Drive, Only God Forgives has moments of nightmarish violence set in a seedy criminal underworld.Set in Bangkok, Thailand, Ryan Gosling plays Julian, a reserved young man who runs an underground boxing club as a front for his drug dealing business. His older brother Billy (Tom Burke) sets out one night with self-destructive tendencies, and rapes and murders and 16 year-old girl. The girl's father takes personal vengeance and kills Billy. Julian sets out for revenge himself, but after hearing the reasons for his brother's murder, realises that some kind of justice has been achieved and lets the man go. But with the arrival of Julian's peroxide-blonde, acid- tongued mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), Julian's hand is forced.For a director so obviously eager to prove to everyone that he's some kind of film-making genius, Only God Forgives is surprisingly familiar in tone. Refn has gone to Thailand to make a Korean movie, full of abstract plot devices, a basic revenge premise, and some squirm- inducing, yet cartoonish scenes of torture and murder. One thing that cannot be denied is that the film looks absolutely beautiful. Like Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void (2009), this is a film seeped in neon-porn, and it's amazing how a bold flash of blue or red can make a scene instantly more wonderful to look at.But the set design and cinematography aside, this is disappointingly empty movie, full of long moments of existential pondering and comically bad dialogue. The movie's antagonist, a crooked police chief named Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), slices his way to his own form of justice, using a sword to execute and dismember his unfortunate victims. He is meant to be a vengeful God to Julian's sinner, and his appearances on screen are meant to fill us with dread, but instead only serves as a warning that more violence will soon implode. As a sort of idiosyncrasy, Chang sings karaoke as his police force watch him silently. It comes across a bit like Dean Stockwell in Blue Velvet (1986), but here it seems pretentious and just rather silly.It's a real love-it-or-hate-it type of movie. On one hand, you have the technical brilliance that helps create a sleazy, slightly unnerving world, but on the other, you have the fact that this is a straight-to- DVD plot with some rather laughable dialogue. Kristin Scott Thomas, playing against type, gets to use the phrase 'cum dumpster' at an uncomfortable dinner with Julian and his 'girlfriend' Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam). It all just feels like Refn is simply trying to antagonise his audience, but he really only insults them. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Only God Forgives

33,Dr_Coulardeau,Let social garbage be dumped in a bottomless landfill.,10,5 December 2013,"A rather small film altogether.The plot is simple. Some American psychopaths go to some underdeveloped third world countries to be able to realize their phantasms without any limits. Thailand is the target here. And two brothers, under the benediction of their mother, just get the sexual fantasies they develop in their twisted minds materialized in the blood of girls, as young as possible, thirteen, fourteen is good.But these countries start developing some police force to take full control of these psychopaths, except that there is no Miranda there and no lawyer and solicitor does not mean lawyer but pimp. One brother kills a girl and is then locked up with the father of the girl who kills him. Then the cop decides to give a lesson to that father who still has two daughters and cuts his right hand. But the second brother and the mother, who arrives from the USA on an emergency trip, have that father killed whose life had been spared. And then they have to confront the cop himself till the cop stands in front of the second son in a fair fist fights. The brother loses. Then the mother takes over and sends the brother and a hit man to the cop's house to kill everyone, including of course his daughter. During that time the cop has killed the mother.Apparently the son spares the daughter, though it is not 100% clear and at the end the cop will gets the hands of that brother, or is it a dream? It is difficult to say at times, because the dialogue is too often music more than words, and ellipses are used in very providential ways to hide the truth.We don't know. One thing is sure anyway. These countries are learning how to resist the westerners who dump their social exhaust there for them not to soil western streets. The end is in blood and the cops of these countries do not make the difference between a cockroach and a psychopath. Crush them all and God will forgive those who were innocent. Cruel it is, but necessary indeed for western psychopaths to be taken care of by their own ""rulers"" if their politicians are rulers, which I deeply doubt when we see how lenient they can be with this social trash. To make a potato edible, you cook it. To make social trash palatable you process it.

34,Floated2,Don't go in expecting another Drive,3,11 January 2014,"Following the success of Drive, Director Nicolas Winding Refn's returned with Only God Forgives, in which has been described as another Drive or somewhat of a sequel since Ryan Gosling is the lead. However Only God Forgives is several levels below Drive and doesn't have the same feel or magic that Drive had. As many have previously said, the film is slow paced with limited dialogue, many emotionless characters though a well shot cinematography.Only God Forgives has a runtime of 90 minutes yet feels as if it plays for about 2 hours. It's pace takes a while to get to something interesting but when it comes, the violence much like Drive is quick and brutal (more so here than in Drive). More torture violence with less emotion. Most of it is in the last 30 minutes of the film and I think that it is a little too late. There is a fight scene towards the end where Ryan Gosling's character and Chang battle which ends up worse than expected. The thought was good but the execution wasn't. It was very emotionless with only a couple of minutes. The camera angles was well shot but I found the scene pointless and didn't understand Gosling's reasoning for wanting to fight the master.Another reason why this film is sub par is because of the lack of character development, and character connection. In Drive, Ryan Gosling's character was likable, interesting and easy to root for. In Only God Forgives, his character is less likable as we know much less except he is dealing with the passing of his brother and he is more distraught. The character development seemed to go nowhere. We see him with his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) a few scenes whom don't have the greatest relationship, which was obvious.Perhaps this is a film which takes a couple viewings to properly understand.",Only God Forgives

There isn't much dialogue throughout the movie, but it's easy to follow, if you into films set in Hong Kong. The acting was also pretty strange because the character just walked around staring into space half the time. Ryan Gosling suited the part well, because of his style of acting, but the storyline was all over the place and sketchy. The whole seedy look to the film gets a bit annoying, with its neon lights, brothels and prostitutes, which made it off putting and I personally lost interest after a while. Disappointing.Round-Up: Every actor has the right to make a couple of bad movies in there career, so I'm sure that this won't hurt Ryan Goslings peak at the moment. After successfully warming to all the ladies heart in Crazy, Stupid Love, with his naked scenes, he has become a bit of a pin up lately so he will always make money at the box office. Anyway, some of the scenes were pretty gruesome in the movie, and I'm glad that they didn't over do it with the subtitles, but I just couldn't get into it.

37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Another visually stunning, cold violent Refn-Gosling outing, only less accessible",6,8 December 2013,"For fans of the Nicolas Winding Refn-Ryan Gosling duo, ""Only God Forgives"" throws a left hook. Although both this film and ""Drive"" have their silent, slow-building moments that give way to shocking, powerful violence, ""Drive"" at least provides a bit more context and story development, whereas ""Only God Forgives"" is like a visual revenge poem.The film takes place in Thailand and centers on the repercussions of a murder and a swift retaliation in the name of justice. Julian (Gosling) deals drugs behind the veil of a Muay Thai boxing ring. When his older brother, Billy (Tom Burke), murders an underage prostitute, retired detective Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) allows the prostitute's father to have his vengeance by letting him kill Billy, but cuts off his arm to even things out. Learning what Billy did, Julian decides not to take the father's life when he has a chance, but when his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) arrives in Thailand, it gets complicated.The above plot summary is not easy to surmise on one's own. The film moves slowly and distorts what's reality with what's in Julian's head. It takes a few minutes to realize that a scene is actually happening and isn't part of Julian's imagination. Refn leans a lot on cinematography to grab audience interest. The neons prevalent in Asian settings and the light shining through ornate oriental wall carvings definitely sets a tone for the film, but it can't be seen as a substitute for the staples of good storytelling. Refn's captivation with the setting of his film doesn't translate with so much utter confusion going on.Symbolism, then, becomes the primary lens for exploring the film's many warped senses of justice. Arms reaching out, hands turning from open palms to clenched fists — in a simple metaphor Refn, captures the capacity of man to do both good and bad. The biggest challenge in appreciating that notion is that the founding incident of the entire movie is a horrific crime and the main characters want their vengeance for a justice that has already been served. Obviously, it will not end well for Julian and his overbearing, cruel mother, who overlook what the audience can so plainly see. At least Julian struggles with it.Gosling has proved countless times he can act without saying a word, which is why he's Refn's muse, but Julian is missing something. There are a lot of forces acting upon and influencing his character, especially his mother, but he doesn't get much of a chance to express himself. He makes a couple crucial decisions that impact that course of the film, but he's a weak, inaccessible protagonist. The supporting characters are no more accessible but definitely contribute to film's impact. Thomas is just despicable, belittling Julian in front of his girlfriend and using downright Freudian tactics to leverage him for her revenge. Pansringarm represents the old-school notion of honor, though he takes himself very seriously. He would make for an interesting character study if Refn was as interested in helping us understand him as he was in fitting him perfectly in the frame.Still, ""Only God Forgives"" is chilling and contemplative. Refn is nothing if not affecting as a filmmaker. He knows how to evoke a strong emotional response in the audience with both imagery and violence. The question always comes down to whether someone watching his film can find some meaning in his graphic yet tacit approach. In this film, it's a bit more shock than awe. Unsurprisingly, that makes ""Only God Forgives"" a love it or hate it kind of film — moments of both ebb in and out.~Steven CThanks for reading!

38,videorama-759-859391,You're not totally forgiven,6,4 January 2014,"I had been hanging out to see this film and I must say I was somewhat disappointed. But also I was mesmerized by the beautiful backdrops, music, and mood of what is basically a chain of revenge story, instigated by a guy, part of crime family of despicable people, who was seeking sex from an underage pro and got pi..ed when he didn't deliver, resulting in a feud, where he killed the son of a powerful crime figure. This figure has dirty cops on standby to clean up his messes. He's a prime fighter, with his fists- just ask at opponent, Gosling's face, the receiver of his deadly blows. He's frighteningly fast and deadly with a sword too. When the sex seeking killer is killed in avengement, the more stronger brother of Gosling's character, Gosling is summoned by his criminal mother, a fantastic Kristin Scott Thomas to avenge his brother's death. After watching Gosling give long, steady, head turning, vacant stares, and not uttering one word in the movie's first half hour, which I must say had me intrigued, while also finding it pretty cool, soon, my expectations perked up at some super cool action sequences, plus a little fighting from Gosling. What I did admire about the film, was it's mood telling the story, not the actors, dialogue kept to a minimum. Some actors are dismally dull in this, lesser performers, extra's, their face muscles hardly moving or showing any emotion. It's as if the filmmakers tried to do the movie and see what it would look like, with as less dialogue as possible. This is not a bad movie, but it's not really a good movie either. It does have some pieces of pretty strong, impactful violence, it's near end, terribly predictable, as is another showdown between you know who, handsome faced Gosling, choosing to die. The Asian joy girls, in this, I must are masterpieces of beauty.",Only God Forgives
39,jtindahouse,"Great title, average movie",6,4 January 2014,"Only God Forgives. Three words. Three very effective words. Words that make you think, ""I need to see that film."" 'Only God Forgives' is a movie with a fantastic title that just can't quite live up to it. Maybe the title itself sets the expectations too high. Maybe the director Nicolas Winding Refn's highly successful previous film 'Drive' also set the expectations too high. Quite likely it's a combination of both. But is it a coincidence that the more successful of the two has a very bland title (thus giving people less expectations, perhaps, going in) and the less successful a very compelling title? Possibly, but I suspect less so than you might suspect.It's not that 'Only God Forgives' is a bad film. It just spends too much of it's time being bland (as I also thought 'Drive' did). Ryan Gosling hardly says a word throughout the film. His character's intense, but I still feel more dialogue from him would add even more layers. The premise is strange and quite likely to confuse or annoy a lot of audience members. The person I watched it with was sick of it very quickly and it never improved for her. There are some very violent scenes, but nothing groundbreaking with all that we get thrown at us in this day and age.It's not that it's a bad film so much, just that it's kind of annoying and dull at the same time for the most part. Movies set in foreign countries, with foreign customs and characters in them, are generally quite hard for an audience to enjoy (just have a look at the flack 'The Hangover Part II' got). The movie worked itself up from about a '4' to a '6' from the halfway point until the end for me. As the story settles down a touch and you come to realise what the film's trying to get across to you it grows on you a touch. Just not enough to make it a great film.",Only God Forgives
40,BeneCumb,Uneven pace due to apparent over-sophistication,5,4 March 2015,"Nicolas Winding Refn is a Dane who has created several distinct films, mostly drug-related, yet with lots of alternating reasoning and action. Usually it is nicely balanced, but not in the one in question, alas. Statics and fast events are too adversary and the result is hectic viewing; moreover, the background and main ideas are trivial, and some twists related did not enhance overall value of the film to me. Ryan Gosling as Julian is torpid and mute, his comprehensions are odd (the part was too simple for him), the Thays are mostly poker-faced and immobile, only Kristin Scott Thomas as Crystal, Julian's mother, was a character performed by pleasant and diversified manner.Well, the film lasted less than 1,5 hours, but there were multiple moments I was longing for faster end.

42,meeza,Gosling is great but he is no Godling to save this movie! Kristin is the best thing here!,7,15 December 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" is quite forgettable, and that I will remember until God's calling for me. Speaking of a higher power, God forgive me but I think this has been the most disappointing movie I have seen so far in 2013. I was really looking forward for the reteaming of acclaimed Director Nicolas Winding Refn and star thespian Ryan Gosling. Their last collaboration ""Drive"" steered right into cinematic brilliance. However, this time they crashed. Gosling stars in ""Only God Forgives"" as Julian, a Bangkok drug dealer who is put in a god-forbidden situation when his tyrant mother Crystal orders him to kill who murdered her son. Winding Refn does an admirable job in once again incorporating his trademark rich color and intriguing tracking shots. However, Refn roughed it up big-time with his mundane screenplay of the picture. Gosling was mostly sleepwalking here with his starring performance as Julian; but he is forgiven due to his impressive resume'. An unrecognizable Kristin Scott Thomas does bring a spark to the movie with her crystal-clear fiery supporting performance as Julian's mother Crystal. The movie also scored a few points with Cliff Martinez' pounding score. However, all that is not enough for me to give ""Only God Forgives"" a must-see blessing. *** Average",Only God Forgives
43,estebangonzalez10,"Loved Drive, Hated Only God Forgives",3,27 July 2013,"""Time to meet the devil.""I've never gone from a love-hate relationship as fast as I have with Nicolas Winding Refn after watching Only God Forgives. His prior film, Drive, was my favorite movie of 2011 and now only two years later I was utterly disappointed with his follow up movie also staring Ryan Gosling. Everything that I loved about Drive, I hated about this film. It was an exercise in style, but it lacked substance. It's an existentialist surrealistic film that never managed to connect with me. I have to admit the style and the visuals were great, but the story was way too vague and the movie didn't say anything to me. I know that there are many film buffs that loved this film and have explained the meaning of the story, but despite understanding what they are saying it didn't really say anything to me. I respect their point of view, but I can't justify a film that narratively didn't draw me in or had no meaning to me personally. I wouldn't want to waste another 89 minutes of my life re watching it and trying to find a deep new meaning just because I didn't see it the first time around. Only God Forgives is a very divisive film and in a way that proves Refn's success here. He did manage to reach to a specific audience just like a specific art piece speaks to one person but to another it is just a paper drawing. Despite how much respect I have for Refn I have to say this was simply an empty exercise in style that we've seen in much better films in the past.Julian (Ryan Gosling) manages a Thai boxing club in Bangkok, but it is only a cover up for his underground drug operation which is the real reason as to where the money comes from. His partner and brother, Billy (Tom Burke) rapes and kills a 16 year old girl and all hell breaks lose. A former police officer, Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), allows the victim's father to kill Billy in order to restore order and balance, but when Billy and Julian's mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), arrives in town to reclaim her son's dead body she asks Julian to kill those people responsible for killing his brother.The plot may seem pretty straightforward like any other revenge movie, but this is far from it. It is a slow paced film with long shots of colorful wallpapered hallways full of silent moments, it is stylish and has little characterizations, the narrative is surreal and dreamy, it sometimes can seem pretentious and extremely showy which may leave the audience feeling tedious, and it is brutal and sadistic in its portrayal of violence. There are extreme close ups on Ryan Gosling whose character shows no emotion at all. I felt like he was just in a photo shoot at times simply modeling for the camera. He only has 22 lines in the entire movie. He was completely empty, but it was exactly the character he was asked to play. Kristin Scott Thomas is supposed to play this menacing character, but she reminded me of Lady Gaga in her weird days. I didn't enjoy her performance at all. Everyone was detached or at least that is how I felt towards the movie. Pansringarm also played a very silent character with some sort of supernatural ability or quality. He was sort of the God figure who was sent to restore order and justice. There is a lot of style in this film and several stunning camera shots but the movie is extremely dull and hollow.",Only God Forgives
44,Fluke_Skywalker,Like a dream... or is it nightmare?,5,1 June 2014,"Like his previous film, 'Drive', Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Only God Forgives' is often times more of an ultra-violent visual tone poem than an actual movie.Filled with striking visuals, ambient music and understated performances, 'Only God Forgives' is likely to be a very polarizing film. Either Refn's storytelling style will connect with you or it won't.This isn't a film for everyone, but I believe it's a film everyone needs to see to find out where they stand.

45,peterp-450-298716,"A sad attempt to emulate ""Drive"" ends up in artistic crap ...",3,3 January 2014,"Refn wants to show clearly what he's good in. Namely bringing a simple story to a higher level by stylistic and artistic tricks . As with ""Drive"" there is a lot of commotion about this movie and there are pro's and contra's of this movie. Refn apparently seems to be a huge fan of David Lynch. Some will consider it as a work of art . Others will qualify it more as complete nonsense and a waste of time when you watch this movie . My opinion lies in between those two and consider it as a great achievement to make an artistic tale of a meaningless story. The intellectual movie audience obviously will give a standing ovation for this one and it will lead to all kinds of theories and opinions. Think long enough about it and you'll discover a deeper philosophical content with appropriate symbolism . If you don't think about it too long, it is actually an empty box with careful attention to the correct ISO settings and lenses that were used .Without a doubt , most images are aesthetically pleasing with its esoteric , neon exposures and the numerous moments where the characters are looking silently around. However, most passages are sometimes so absurd and hilarious. The sequence of a murder , the revenge of the daughters father and a Karaoke bar, in that order, gave me on one side a wondering impression , and on the other hand, I could not suppress shaking my head, chuckling . The karaoke is reused a few times in this movie. I'm still wondering what the symbolic value this has.When you look at the characters it seems like a bunch of autistic persons , who react in the most unnatural way to situations ,take their time to give a meaningful response and after that start staring at an infinite point. Each of them master the best ""Bold and the Beautiful""-staring technique. Gosling is actually a duplicate of his character in ""Drive"" . A silent person with the empathy of a good working American fridge . The news about the death of his brother, not even makes a small change in his facial expression . The fact that he's actually totally harassed and ignored by his mother , raises the same dispassionate attitude .The entire movie is a concatenation and a secure editing of fragments with lots of neon light and proportional masterfully placed image impressions . A snapshot of a belt , a beautiful oriental girl behind red fluorescent beads , a flash of bodybuilders , a karaoke bar , at the ceiling staring people .... Take all the moments away where someone meaningless stares at the horizon , and you keep a simple revenge story of roughly 20 minutes.To make it acceptable for a larger audience you throw some bloody fragments in it and a realistic, lively fight where Gosling end up with a rather damaged face.In short : a simple revenge story held together by arty interventions . In my view, not such a work of art as it should appear to be.",Only God Forgives
46,Agent10,Artistic Revenge,7,2 February 2021,"I don't understand the general dislike for this film. Yeah, I heard all the reviews and admittedly, the reviews turned me away from the initial release. It didn't help it was only in my town for a week. Either way.... I low key love this film.I love the color palate. I love the pace. I love how it creates a world completely alien to the one I live in. While the story is very basic, it is visceral. You understand how Kristin Scott Thomas commands so much fear. You understand how Julian does not want to be like her. You understand how Chang prefers to work outside the confines of law and order with his own brand of justified punishment. The motives are clear, and while the older brother Billy is way too cartoony evil, we had to quickly establish the central conflict.The thing about such a film is this...where does art end and pretentiousness begin? I think a lot of people interpreted this more for the latter than the former, wanting a dull Tarantino style revenge epic with tons of swearing and pretentious pop culture dialogue. What they got was a neon bathed slow burn, and it worked so much better. In the end, we see why it would happen that way. Chang is brutal and even caustic, but he is fair in the dog eat dog world of the drug dealing underclass. And boy, did that ending seem satisfying.Those who have not seen a lot of film from multiple eras and styles of film making might not get this type of feature, but that is okay.

47,dierregi,The driver moved to Bangkok... and his name is Julian,1,28 May 2013,"Starts as a straightforward tale of revenge. A drug-trafficking family is torn apart when elderly son Billy (Tom Burke) is killed in Bangkok, where he was living to run a Thai boxing establishment with younger brother Julian (Gosling). Their mother Crystal (Scott Thomas) disembarks in Bangkok in a bitchy mood and ready to retaliate. Unfortunately (for Crystal) a formidable and mysterious police officer is also mixed up with Billy's well deserved demise.Add to this a weird side plot, involving Julian's girlfriend of some sort, a Thai girl named Mai. Once you get to know Julian's mother, you will not be surprised by his twisted sexuality. Unfortunately this part of the movie seems only a time-filler and an attempt to add more ""Lyncheanesque"" atmosphere to the creepy tale.Much was written about the Crystal/Julian relationship. Actually, it is the only part of the movie with a sparkle of life. Their confrontations are fiendishly entertaining, especially the dinner scene, with Crystal comparing the genitals' size of her two sons and delivering bitchy remarks about Mai's profession. Hardly the sort of conversation one would expect dining with mother.Much was written also about the violence, but it is so stylized as to be annoying more shocking.It may sounds like ""dark"" fun, but it is not. What could have been a good, albeit quite predictable tale of revenge, on screen plays as monumentally pretentious. The director seems to have a fetish for symmetrical images and we get plenty of perfectly centered shots. Everybody moves so slowly I had the feeling of watching photos rather than a movie. Add the long silences and the ""dream"" sequences (or whatever they are) and the results is a movie that tries too hard to be cool.Praise to Gosling, for playing stoically a character who can be described as a dumb spineless looser. Unfortunately, it also seems like a reprise of his equally annoying, taciturn character in Drive. Praise to Scott Thomas, who must have had a lot of fun with her part. But bravery alone cannot save the final result.Refn has a short career based on directing movies with titles such as Pusher and Valhalla Rising. He seems to be aiming at supreme cinematic criminal coolness. Perhaps he reached it already with Drive.Maybe Thai audiences will enjoy with the movie. I am not sure die-hard fans of Drive (of which I am not) will...Actually, the only reason I decided to watch this was because I recently visited Thailand and I felt nostalgic. Since the movie opens and closes with titles in Thai, my nostalgia was momentarily wiped off, but then it felt like yet another sign of its unbearable pretentiousness.",Only God Forgives
48,truemythmedia,Still Mulling It Over,6,23 July 2019,"""Only God Forgives"" starts out the way that I like a drug fueled trip into the criminal underbelly to start. Lots of enigmatic imagery, neon light, synth sound score, and only a little bit of explanation as we go. The unfortunate side of that coin, however, is that when things begin to be revealed it isn't very subtle or complicated.As I started the movie I found myself thinking, ""Aw yeah. Here we go"" but by the end I was checking my phone. The story and character revelations never rise in such a way as to engage any other part of my being than the one that enjoys good camera work and lighting. It never tapped into my love for story or theme.I think there is a theme in the film I am missing though. I have to rewatch it. I know that Winding Refn was criticised for this film having its theme intentionally kept hidden without much cause, another occurrence of his pretensions.I can't say what that theme is yet but there are hints of it in the characters' relationships to each other. The fighting imagery vs the pacifism it seems Gosling (""Blade Runner 2049"") has toward the Cop (Vithaya Pansringarm, ""A Prayer Before Dawn""), and also in the performance and singing scenes which seem like they may mean something having to do with how the world sees the cop or maybe a comparison between him and the mother played by Kristin Scott Thomas (""The Horse Whisperer"").",Only God Forgives

50,EdgarST,Mother's Day,10,19 November 2015,"Nicolas Winding Refn rules! I admit that my admiration for Refn is unconditional: the «Pusher» trilogy, «Bronson», «Drive» and «Only God Forgives», which is the cause of my euphoria. Dedicated to Alejandro Jodorowsky, this is a hint that suggests that this is not a realistic action film, and more something in the lines of «El Topo». To the surprise of many, this is a classic tale of revenge with the high and strikingly emotional charge of a Greek tragedy, a Calderonian drama or an Elizabethan play. It is a reflection on parenthood (as well as motherhood of an incestuous nature), in which the defense of the characters' children is the central motivation for the deadly action. «Only God Forgives» is pure cinema refined in 89 minutes (not one of those 180-240 minute pieces of crap that tell us what we have heard a million times), in which only precise words are needed, in which images reign and the structure takes shape as blood hits the audience's brains in its run in and out of their hearts, allowing sentiments to add to the cathartic effect. Ryan Gosling (who has as many detractors as sycophants) is an example of restraint and control in almost all the motion pictures I have seen him in. It curiously works very well, for those traits seem intrinsic to the archetype he embodies, that of the modern Caucasian and English-speaking man, completely stunned by a bastard world dominated by those of his kind, the present-day savages of the North, until the times come for those living in the South, or we decide to live as human beings in peace all over the planet. Vithaya Pansringarm is the old Thai enforcer (Thailand and Apichatpong Weerasethakul are quite fashionable these days, what can you do, you have to forgive Refn for that), without Chow Yun Fat's syrupy charm; and Kristin Scott Thomas, looking badly aged, cheap and not glamorous, is the bitchiest mother of all bitchy mothers since the days of María Elena Marqués as the legendary «La llorona» (1960), Bette Davis in «The Anniversary» (1968) or Anjelica Huston in «The Grifters» (1990). I just hope Refn knows when it is enough and time to retire in good form, and not end his days doing what John Ford and others did in old age.

51,p-stepien,Red and blue cocoon of irrelevance,5,21 May 2014,"Hot of the heels of his breakthrough to the big league, Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn delivers a vivid pastel of imagery firmly situated on top of a self-flagellating revenge flick, which makes Johnnie To look like Akira Kurosawa. When Billy (Tom Burke), one of two brothers leading a drug trafficking ring and muay-thai fighting arena, haplessly decides to go on a hunt to rape and kill a underage prostitute, he is soon exacted punishment through the actions of police lieutenant Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm). This in turn brings about a spiralling circle of violence, when their mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) attempts to induce vengeful retribution on those responsible, despite the half-hearted opposition of the quietly numb younger sibling Julian (an ever-distant Ryan Gosling).With ""Drive"" as a reference point, Refn seemingly intended to push the envelope further down the road, replacing the withdrawn anti-hero with a tirade of depraved villains, offering only two characters: Chang and Julian any sort of moral code, however skewed and lopsided it may be. This essentially makes neither the story nor the characters relatable in the slightest, making the almost oniric film language painted with red and blue (to an extreme not ventured into since the glory days of Dario Argento) a distanced voyage into a dark fable of gloom and doom. Depending on your taste buds this is undoubtedly a hit-and-miss type of movie, easily attention grabbing with its artsy endeavour in bloody circles of violence, but lacking essential movie meat underneath the skinned body. As such it can be admired for its crazed trippiness or for the beautiful suddenness of splattered carcasses.This beautiful cocoon of irrelevance is essentially good viewing, but despite its adventurous experimentation it still seemed overly derivative of Hong Kong, Korean or other East Asian revenge dramas. Nonetheless Refn boldly borrows aesthetics and even some concepts or specific scenes, successfully transposing the language into a Western- made movie (a success in itself) without a hint of pastiche or reverence. From a filmmaking point of view a success, but with characters so detached from viewer interest it comes off more as a failed experiment into the formation of an alternative 'non-hero' protagonist.",Only God Forgives

I can't find one likable character in the screenplay (Chang is awesome and implacable, but he isn't likable).So what's left? Awesome sets, amazing sound design, mesmerizing soundtrack, and colors a viewer could get drunk on. It's also a very ""quiet"" film - dialog seems mumbled, clipped, terse, there's no narration, no musical stings, nothing to enliven the events or detract from them. (It's actually rather restful).

54,moviewizguy,Why So Serious?,4,20 July 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" is a superficial revenge flick with a thin plot, failing to break beneath the surface of its shallow characters. Where ""Drive"" fired on all cylinders, ""Only God Forgives"" spun its wheels. It's almost aimless at times, and director Nicolas Winding Refn employs his style to the point of self-parody. By no means is ""Only God Forgives"" a bad film. It is technically well made, with gorgeous cinematography and beautiful lighting, and I would be lying if I didn't say it was compelling to watch. The performances by the cast are also very good, especially Kristin Scott Thomas. However, Ryan Gosling doesn't have much to do in his one dimensional role. It's been said he only has around 20 lines in the film, but I don't see what the big deal is. It felt like he had enough lines, and I barely noticed his lack of dialogue at all. Despite that, we don't get to know much about his character or any of the other characters really. They're all driven by revenge, and that's as far as their emotions go. On top of that, the film carries this self-important quality and oh-so-serious attitude, you wish Refn would relax and lighten up. Everything about ""Only God Forgives"" spells out ""deep"" and ""profound,"" but it's neither one of those. Instead, it's like every revenge film you've seen before, only more deliberate in pace and with above-average cinematography. While a step back, Refn is still one of the more interesting directors working today, so you can bet I'll be there for his next film.",Only God Forgives

Then, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thompson) his mother, arrives from the states and puts out her own contract to find the killer. Crystal is also a drug runner.This was not good at all. This started out like it would be somewhat erotic, and there were some pointless and uncomfortable female masturbation scenes within to bring this about. We never learn much about Julian, but if we consider him impotent, and wildly afraid of his mother, then some things make sense in here. The camera work focused and lingered too much on items symbolizing something that only a few would understand the significance of; too many long silences and constant staring into space by Julian, and others; very little dialogue all around; everything seemed to be in slow-motion like in a dream sequence; at times singers would sing and they did it in Thai language and there were no sub-titles to tell us what they were singing about; scene changes were abrupt that caught us off guard; the dialogues coming from Crystal were harsh, stilted, potty-mouthed that mentioned sexual body parts in a very crude, and raunchy manner and that made her utterances extremely uncomfortable to hear. The acting performances all around needed work. Add to this some killings by swords to include bloody gore that came in to shock us from time to time.The endingwell, there wasn't one to our satisfaction. We still don't know what happened. Guess we better learn that symbolism. All in all. not good at all. The story was simple enough, but all the above trumped it. Someone forgot there was a story to tell and got us lost in symbolism and other pointless things and we concluded that God has a lot to forgive. (1/10)Violence: Yes.

56,Sergeant_Tibbs,Too entertaining to hate. Pretentious and laughable.,5,10 August 2013,"Drive earned Nicolas Winding Refn a legion of deserved fans with its tense and elegant take on a neon Los Angeles. Immediately, Refn and Gosling's followup, Only God Forgives, became one of the most hotly anticipated films of its year. The concept seemed like a winner and they could have just retread the ground Drive in a different environment for it to be satisfying. Instead, they took it on the completely opposite route and completely divided opinion into love-hate camps. It's a cryptic art film that tries to entice its viewer into the atmosphere and take them on a wild ride. Unfortunately, nothing seems to click for Only God Forgives and there's no ride to have. It's slow, repetitive, void of interesting conflict and ends up unintentionally amusing. Although it's very different to Drive, I actually liked the cinematography and sometimes the score. There's a mood there but its context is too bland to be engaging. It can feel quite pretentious with its use of lighting and shadows but the fluid motions with the tracks compliment the intricate production design very well. It's closer to last years Holy Motors than anything. But Holy Motors had engaging points to make, if just as ambiguous.Here, actors pose like models in an art project. Which can be fine, but Only God Forgives has its foot in the middle of what it wants to be that it never resonates. Where's the humanity? Ryan Gosling sticks out like a sore thumb. While he immersed himself in the role of the driver, he seems like he's sleepwalking through this film and renders his performance unintentionally hilarious. Every expression he had and everything he did felt so inappropriate that it made me laugh, I couldn't help it. That's the problem with the film, it begs to be taken seriously but its drama is so ridiculous and unnatural that I can't imagine a universe where people can connect to it. Even when the film isn't trying to have a story, it's repetitive violence with meaningless suspense that could've been interesting if it was clear what it meant. Or if it had any of the grit and slickness that made you clench your teeth as Gosling stomped on a man's head in the elevator. I can see why people love or hate the film but it's just too entertaining for me to hate. I couldn't take my eyes off but in all the ways it never intended. I rarely care if films are pretentious if they work but Only God Forgives defines the word pretension. At least Refn isn't doing fan service, I guess.5/10",Only God Forgives

Like most directors these days they use shock tactics - foul language , extreme violence and sex because they have not the inspiration and art that real directors like John Carpenter, Sam Peckinpah, Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott used to have!I have to laugh at all the so called art-fart types who think this is art and so much beyond us mere mortals; the types who think Tracy Emmins tent and used condoms garbage is better than a Constable, Renoir, Vettriano or even Picasso - so deluded.The thing that gets me with this director is the utter sexual perversiona and degradation and extreme violence that he seems obsessed with - how sad; it seems the days of good acting and story are a bygone era. If i wanted to watch cinematic excrement like this; which I dont, I would just go and watch a snuff porno!",Only God Forgives
58,Screen_Blitz,"Compared to Drive, this one fails miserably at nearly every conceivable level",1,24 December 2015,"Director Nicholas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling reunite after their first collaboration in the art-house crime-drama 'Drive', in this psychological thriller. Ryan Gosling play Julian, a drug smuggler who has fled to crime-ridden streets of Bangkok after brutally murdering a man. There, he runs a Thai boxing club part time, while managing a drug dealing business. When his older brother Billy (played by Tom Burke) rapes and kills an underage prostitute, Choi Yan Lee, father of the victim is enlisted by a corrupt Thai police officer Lieutenant Chang (played by Vithaya Pansringarm) to kill him. With his brother dead, Julian's mother (played by Kristin Scott Thomas) gets the news and flies down to Bangkok where he sends him on a mission to hunt down the man responsible for his brother's murder.Despite the success with Nicholas Winding Refn's previous film 'Drive', I had low expectations going into this film. Drive was an ambitious art-house thriller with amazing performances, stunning cinematography, and solid writing. This film on the hand, is a whole another story; a bloody, violent, tedious thriller that suffers from severely underdeveloped characters, stunted pacing, and a plot that makes almost. The only luxury viewers are blessed is the solid lighting and beautiful effects, everything else simply is just a mess. The film starts off with a promising premise of the main character's brother who is apparently an animal as he rapes and violently kills a prostitute for reasons unknown, and this results in this gruesome murder. From there on, viewers are introduced his mother who demands vengeance on the man responsible for the travesty. The story quickly transcends into a revenge plot, and at the point, it ceases to make any sense. The film spends the rest of the time horribly pacing through convoluted scenes and sickening violence that alternate between boring and confusing to watch. Now lets step to the characters. The film is filled with so many uninteresting and unlikable characters that feel so wooden, its impossible to comprehend them. Ryan Gosling's character is supposed to pose as a character of solid appeal, but is sadly severely underwritten that he has nothing to give his performance to. Even the main villain lacks depth and feels more like a cookie-cutter character than villain. Drive was a film that treated audiences with some interesting characters, solid plot, and incredible cinematography; and this film seems like Nicholas Winding Refn tried to copy what we did but fails horribly. Only God Forgives is a highly disappointing movie that fails nearly everything that 'Drive' brought to the screen, and anyone who was not quite fond of that movie enjoy will definitely hate this one. This is not a film I recommend.",Only God Forgives
59,Troy_Campbell,A missed opportunity.,4,19 July 2013,"Danish auteur Nicolas Winding Refn's first Hollywood picture Drive is one of the best films of the millennium, hands down. His Thailand-set revenge saga feels like a natural extension of that masterpiece, albeit a very boring and pretentious one. Where Drive was slow-burning and enrapturing, OGF is slow and uninteresting; where Ryan Gosling's Driver was charismatic and compelling, his drug-dealing enigma here is dull and vacuous; Drive's violence was impactful and meaningful, the brutality in this is nasty and pointless. There are, however, two shining lights that save this from being completely unwatchable. The neon-lit cinematography is simply stunning and quite often disguises the senselessness of what is actually going on, whilst the ballsy performance from Kristen Scott Thomas as Gosling's reprehensible white-trash mother is a terrific display of her versatility and deserving of a much better movie. A missed opportunity that suggests Refn is a hit and miss prospect.",Only God Forgives
60,Prashast_Singh,Not something for everyone; an offbeat action piece.,10,18 December 2020,"Needless to say, Ryan Gosling and Nicolas Winding Refn's iconic duo left me impressed with Drive (2011), an arthouse take on the action genre. With Only God Forgives reuniting them, I expected a similar film: not in terms of story, but genre and execution, and while it turned out to be that, I can't say this is for everyone. Gosling, who once again plays a quiet protagonist with lines as few to recite, at times feels like a supporting character instead. Kristin Scott Thomas delivers a similarly terrific yet controlled performance, while it's Vithaya Pansringarm who steals the show with his surprising, menacing performance. You can tell something big's about to happen every single time he's on screen.One of the biggest reasons a slow yet simple story like this doesn't feel dragged is largely due to the length. Roughly one and a half hour long, the plot of Only God Forgives isn't that hard to follow, though the way some scenes have been executed can cause some confusion for sure. Nevertheless, the film is brutal and action-packed; while several violent moments are high on shock value, there are also some high-octane, enjoyable action sequences where Refn reminds the viewer of his sheer skill at crafting action. The way he chooses to place the action sequences and the way he builds up the tension before we see the violence unfold, is in itself a pretty impressive sign of artistic filmmaking. With this film, he has shown that on one hand, we can enjoy fast-paced violent action while also finding a slower version of it disturbing on the other hand.The reason why many might find this slow or hard to continue is because the dialogue's minimal and there are several long, quiet moments only those accustomed to watching slow-burn can relish. Myself being used to it, I did like the film personally. I got this on DVD knowing I'd like it, but wasn't sure if I'd want to see it again. But having watched it, I can say that at least the action sequences are worth revisiting, if not the whole film itself. Only God Forgives is a pretty apt title for a film like this. There were moments when the perverse language felt more disturbing than the violence itself, and since Refn possibly intended to make the viewer feel like that, I can say his effort succeeded. At least for me, it did.",Only God Forgives
61,Jeremy_Urquhart,"A flawed, fascinating, neon-infused nightmare",7,27 July 2013,"I've found the response to this movie fascinating. It literally may be the biggest and most obvious example of a ""love it or hate it film"" in recent years. And honestly, that's understandable. This is by no means a film for anyone. Even some who enjoyed Winding Refn's and Gosling's last collaboration (2011's Drive, a very good film that grew on me progressively more each time I watched it) will walk away from this one disappointed. It's artsy, very violent, metaphorical, and lacks a definite plot and characters. But it's still something very much worth watching, even only for the fact that you can then be prepared to discuss and debate the year's most divisive film.There is a plot here, but it's pretty simple, and honestly not too important. Actually, it's probably not even worth explaining here in this review. All it really does is justify the film's symbolic images, scenes of gruesome violence, and trippy, disturbing imagery. And honestly, I thought that was okay. I knew going into this that the plot wasn't going to be hugely involving, and so there really didn't end up being any disappointment in that regard. This is not your conventional 3-act story or anything, so don't go in expecting a satisfying and easily noticeable beginning, middle, and end.In a similar fashion, the characters here aren't too compelling in a typical manner. As far as the standard narrative is concerned, they're not particularly unique, or even likable. This is, on the surface level, a film about very evil people doing very evil things. It may be better to think of these characters as representing certain traits or ideas rather than looking at them as simply characters in a story. Winding Refn apparently spoke frequently about what each main character basically represented, and as someone who didn't really follow the interviews where he spoke about such things I really don't know if the film made it clear enough that the characters represented what they did. Maybe that's my problem for being stupid, but I'm not sure.I must admit though, I was probably too pre-occupied with admiring how the film looked to think about the characters too hard. This movie is shot amazingly, and the amount of style in the film is hard to deny. I especially loved the use of colours throughout the film, with lots of dark reds and blues being used, which often looked striking when put against the darkness that was present throughout many of the film's scenes. The soundtrack's great too- perhaps not as good as the one from Drive, but the songs here work well for the scenes they accompany. It is a fantastic looking and sounding film, and I'd say it's worth checking the movie out at least once for these factors alone.Acting's good too. Yeah, we've seen this sort of performance from Ryan Gosling before, but he does do it really well. Maybe he should mix it up a bit and do a few more roles where he's not quiet, brooding, and intense, but to be honest I didn't mind him kind of rehashing a few of his earlier performances here. Vithaya Pansringarm was very good too in a sort of, maybe villainous role (and I'd like to add that I'm thankful I'm typing this review and not speaking it, as there's no way I could begin to try and pronounce that guy's name).So, the bottom line? This movie's strange. Really strange. I liked it, but I honestly don't know if I can recommend it to many people at all. Yes, I know it's probably worth watching for the cinematography and music, as well as the fact that it allows one to know what everyone else is talking about, but I can make no guarantees to anyone over whether or not they'd like it. You liked Drive? You might like this one. You hated Drive? You also might like this one. You can usually handle artsy, slow-paced movies? There's a possibility this one will be too slow for you. You like Ryan Gosling? No guarantees you'll like it just because he's in it. And I could go on...So, what we have here is a unique film full of disturbing violence (seriously, this one's really brutal), surreal imagery, strange yet intoxicating music, a lack of a real plot, and some pretty crazy pacing. There were some parts of the movie where I was enthralled by what was happening on screen (especially at the beginning and towards the end), yet other points where I almost felt like nodding off. There's very little consistency in this movie, and with the pacing and the violence and the ambiguity, it's not exactly an easy one to watch. Maybe give it a try though. Inevitably though, I liked it. I think. I'll be revisiting it eventually in order to properly decipher exactly how I feel about this film. Upon a second viewing, will I love the film? Will I hate it? Will it make any more sense to me? I'm not sure.Perhaps only God knows... and forgives. (Get it? Cos that's like the name of the movie? I should be a comedian).",Only God Forgives
62,brchthethird,"Minimalist and violent to the extreme, but nonetheless thought-provoking",8,14 November 2014,"It doesn't have any character development to speak of, but that's the point: all of the characters are archetypes and they all serve to tell a simple story about the nature of things. In this case, the film largely deals with nature and subjective morality of revenge, but also touches on parent-child relationships (Julian's mother is kind of like Oedipus' mother), the way in which the cycle of violence affects us, and how justice is served and affects us in an abjectly cruel world. While it touches on a lot of weighty subjects, the movie still doesn't say anything truly profound, save, that violence begets more violence but that justice will eventually be served. On the quality of the film, it's what you would expect from Refn: immaculately composed cinematic images, brilliant use of color and mood and a moody soundtrack (from Cliff Martinez, who did Drive as well) which lends a certain intensity to the whole affair. Overall, this a great movie which should be seen by any self-respecting cineaste.",Only God Forgives

On the other hand, there are many minutes of no dialog. Also, many lines of dialog have no translation into English, whereas the spoken English usually has subtitles.Acting: 2/10 Acting?

65,aciessi,Forgive and Forget?,5,12 June 2015,"This is a hard one. I really liked this movie in parts, and really didn't like it in other parts. Let's be clear, the cinematography is absolutely incredible. Those vivid, neon lights that scream depravity, along with on the whole, awe-inspiring camera work. This is one of the best looking films I've seen in many years. But all that glitters isn't gold. Unfortunately, what we have is a perplexing story. We have characters with little to no motivation in their actions. The mother and son gangsters played Gosling and Scott Thomas want to avenge the death of their slain loved- one, but if only we could genuinely believe that. Gosling, once again, shines brightly as an emotionless, cold-hearted psycho.. and that's only credited to how amazing an actor he is. But this character doesn't work on the premise of being vengeful. He's a puppet of his mother, we get that.. and perhaps reluctant about his mission, but still, I don't fully get his motivations. Scott Thomas as the mother is pretty much repugnant in all the wrong ways. She's a potty- mouthed little pig. Again, it makes you wonder about the full motivation. The murderer of the brother, Chang, is probably the most fully realized character of the film. He's a silent, blood- thirsty, unrelenting killer mob-boss, like a Thai version of Paul Cicero, with a black belt. Some of his scenes are magnificent. But then, they have him singing in a Thai karaoke bar. A heavy handed reassurance to the audience that he is.. human. The film loses me again. Why did this keep happening? I like this film, and there is much room for forgiveness in the end, but the effort doesn't all pay off. This is a film incomplete. A rough cut. With a clearer story, an utter masterpiece could've emerged from this.",Only God Forgives

67,bryank-04844,"'Only God Forgives' is less than 90 minutes, but feels like three hours as we journey through a slow-moving, neon-laced maze of corridors.",2,23 August 2015,"'Drive', the first collaboration between director Nicolas Winding Refn and star Ryan Gosling, was one of my favorite films of 2011. It was original, fresh, had a killer soundtrack and a colorful cast of characters. I own the Blu-ray, the soundtrack album, and even stickers from the movie. Needless to say, when I heard that Refn was making another film in the same vein called 'Only God Forgives', I was excited with pure joy and couldn't wait to see it. Not only would the movie star Ryan Gosling again and amp up the violence and suspense, but it would take place in Thailand and pack in enough blood for two films. Man, was I proved dead-wrong about my expectations and came out sorely disappointed.'Only God Forgives' is less than 90 minutes, but feels like three hours as we journey through a slow-moving, neon-laced maze of corridors, violent stare-downs and several brutal murder scenes that would make Tarantino blush. Mixing a bit of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch, Refn takes us to the Thailand underworld, where we meet Julian (Gosling), a drug lord who fronts as a boxing promoter. In the first five minutes of the film, Julian's big brother Billy (Tom Burke) decides that he wants to rape a 14-year-old girl. When he can't, he goes on a violent rampage until he gets a 16-year-old girl, and then ends up brutally killing her anyway.After the murder, a senior police chief known as Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) – who dresses like a priest – acts as judge, jury and executioner to his cases. In this particular one, he allows the father of the dead 16-year-old to kill Billy, but also punishes the father for allowing his daughter to be a prostitute, by way of chopping his arm off.The only saving grace for me in the film is Kristen Scott-Thomas, who plays Julian and Billy's mother, Crystal, the head Mob boss back in the States. She arrives in Thailand to identify and pick up her son's body, and we see her true colors once she arrives at the posh hotel where the desk clerk won't allow her to check in early. Once settled, Crystal sees Julian and forces him to get revenge on his brother's killer. From here, Julian must track down and find Chang before he and his fellow police officers catch up to him and Crystal. What follows is a slow-paced story that seems to move in slow motion with dream sequences and a couple of ultra-violent scenes, including a poor victim being stabbed in the eyes, another burned by hot cooking oil, and much more.One of the best scenes gives us a little bit of background on Julian's childhood. When he brings a call girl as his date to a fancy dinner with his mother, Crystal immediately figures out that she's not his girlfriend, but a prostitute, and asks her specifically, ""How many cocks can you entertain with your cum dumpster?"" This is followed by a graphic description of her two sons' penises and why Julian is always jealous of his brother's bigger size.While Scott-Thomas may be the most entertaining character due to her impeccable delivery and funny lines, Chang is the most intriguing. He floats across the screen graciously as if he were the angel of death. He never loses his temper, and carries out his executions as if they were the norm. He also follows-up each day with a karaoke number in front of his fellow police officers.Gosling literally only has a dozen lines in the film, and spends the rest of the time staring at the camera.The camera-work is great and the movie as a whole looks incredible. It reminds me a bit of Kubrick's 'The Shining', with tons of Stedicam shots that weave in and out of long corridors. However, that's really the only aspect of the film I enjoyed. Fans of super-violent movies might want to catch this one purely for that aspect, but for the rest of us, feel free to skip it.",Only God Forgives
68,mikayakatnt,Love-Hate Relationship with This Movie,7,13 January 2020,"A dark, violent, neon-flooded film. Ryan Gosling in his element.Only God Forgives is a slow-moving yet beautiful crime film based in Bangkok, Thailand. It's a film that has to be carefully watched to be enjoyed. Viewers are rewarded with satisfying violence and stunning visuals.The plot is a basic revenge storyline with some twists and turns. The real and surreal are blended to amplify the sleazy underbelly of Thailand.Acting performance can be debated among viewers. Some view Ryan Gosling's performance as lacking emotion. Yet, I found this to be the point of his character. Certains lines and dialogue may seem overused yet it doesn't take too much away from the movie.Cinematography is jaw-droppingly beautiful. From the beginning to the end, this movie will bathe you in well-thought-out set-pieces, use of colors and imagery, and stunning visuals. The setting and cinematography do a lot of the heavy lifting to this film that makes so many viewers love it. Special appreciation to Larry Smith and his team for their stellar work.Sound design and music also add a lot to this film that makes it so damn enjoyable. I'll have to applaud Kristian Eidnes Andersen and Eddie Simonsen for their work.Yet, after all the pros this movie offers, I felt that there seemed to have been a certain ""oomf"" missing. This film did not stay with me as long as I'd like. That may as well be this film's greatest sin.3.5/5. Beautiful eye and ear candy.

Everytime I watch it I'm just in awe at how good this film looks.Ryan Gosling in this movie is amazing in the way he just stares into the abyss in the most inhuman way possible. He's eyes rarely focus.
I love the music. The karaoke scenes, particularly the one that closes the film, are amazing. This movie has probably my favorite ending credit sequence of all time.This film just wraps around me and doesn't let me go. Masterful from a technical perspective and a lot more emotional than most people might think. I never found it boring, I never though it was confusing, and I definitetly never thought it was just shallow eye candy.Behind all the neon and violence hides a disturbing story of two brother's sexual and psychological abuse at the hands of their domineering mother, and the guilt that one of them feels for the crimes he commited under her command. It just so happens to be told in a mostly implied way.What can I say? I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies.",Only God Forgives

Almost every shot is filled with vibrant colors and imagery. Where the film falters mostly is in its plot. Not very much happens and it's very straightforward. Yes, there are some interesting metaphors about God and delivering justice, but it's surrounded by uninteresting characters. I usually don't have a problem with violence in film, but some of the violence in here didn't serve the plot at all and seemed more like fetishized violence. Only God Forgives has some unique philosophical pinings and some undeniably cool moments, but ultimately seems a little too much style over substance. Definitely do not expect a sequel to Drive.",Only God Forgives
71,asda-man,Only critics destroy,9,19 September 2013,"Drive, Drive, Drive! That's all people thought of (me included) when we saw the first trailer for Only God Forgives. For some reason we assume that Nicolas plus Ryan Gosling equals Drive 2. However, Nicolas has rather pleasantly showed us that he is capable of creating an entirely different beast altogether. I actually think (contrary to most people) that Only God Forgives is even better than Drive. It's easy to see why the film got famously booed at Cannes. It's relentlessly violent, slower than mainstream films and has very little dialogue. However, I am surprised that it has sparked as much universal hate as it has, although I do think you have to be in the right frame of mind when you watch it. If you regularly watch mainstream action films with Jason Statham, then don't bother. Similarly, if you can't immerse yourself within a film, and find yourself watching a screen, then don't bother.Only God Forgives may seem superficial on the surface, however if you dig deeper you can find a very complex web going on underneath it all. Only God Forgives is more of an experience than a film. I found myself completely immersed within its dark and dream-like world. The long drawn-out shots, moody score and intense dream-like atmosphere are not dissimilar to something David Lynch would create. This is quite a compliment coming from me as I believe that David Lynch is one of the greatest directors of all time. The scenes where the fascinating God-like character, Chang sings at the karaoke bar evoke the Club Silencio scene in Mulholland Drive. I found it powerful and compelling for no particular reason.The biggest complaint Only God Forgives receives is that it's slow. People complaining about the pace have clearly never seen possibly the most boring and underrated film of all time, Uzak which moves at a pace which would make a snail weep. Only God Forgives is slow, but I was never bored. There's an extremely strong atmosphere in Only God Forgives. Every shot seems to be drenched in doom and seedy (but beautiful) neon lighting. Just like Drive, every shot is meticulously crafted. The positioning and lighting are clearly perfected just like in a Stanley Kubrick film. Because of this I was never bored.I was also fascinated by all of the characters. Ryan Gosling says virtually nothing, yet he somehow seems like a deep and complex character. Chang is possibly the most fascinating character in the film. He's a relentless and untouchable force and it was a very interesting move to compare him to God. Plum Berkley steals the show, however, as the domineering and creepy mother. Every scene she's in is full of awkwardness and intensity. Some of the things she said can also be hard to take. I was never sure if the film was trying to be darkly humorous or disturbing, however I don't mean this in a negative way. I enjoyed all of the characters immensely.The high point of the film is probably the climatic battle between Chang and Julian. It's a wonderfully choreographed and brutal scene where you feel every punch. This brings me on to the next big criticism which is that Only God Forgives is sadistically violent. This is true. I'm used to violent films that use disturbing torture such as: Inside, Martyrs and Audition. However, there was one particular scene which I found incredibly hard to watch. I did manage to watch it though. I think the violence was harder than it needed to be, but it did show the type of relentless man Chang is. I'm also one of these sickos that isn't adverse to a bit of blood and gore. I don't think Only God Forgives is glamorising violence in any way.Needless to say I loved Only God Forgives. When it ended I felt haunted and I wasn't sure how to take it. However, it has now sunk in and after reading analysis' of the film I can see how complex and intelligent it is. I think it's a misunderstood film. It's hugely atmospheric and engaging. I was gripped throughout, in fact the film probably could've done with being a little bit longer. It's full of unforgettable and powerful scenes which I admired greatly. Only God Forgives is very nearly a masterpiece.",Only God Forgives
72,Rickting,There's a difference between deep and pretentious,4,5 January 2015,"There is no plot. Only God Forgives, Nicolas Winding Refn's follow up to the apparently amazing Drive fails to come up with anything more than a lazy revenge storyline where Ryan Gosling is compelled by his mother to find whoever's responsible for the death of the brother he despised. This has split people down the middle. Some will see it as a brooding, visually brilliant and haunting masterpiece while others will nearly nod off. I didn't know quite what to make of it, but the truth is: This wastes its potential with its insistence of being arty, slow paced and unconventional to the point of walkout inducing arrogance. This obnoxiously smug art house thriller thinks its being smart, and to be fair, maybe it is. Ryan Gosling looking at his hands, loads of visual metaphors, dream montages, a weird mother son relationship, endless starring and karaoke in a night club do not tell us anything. The neon soaked, dazzling visuals are unbelievable, and the silence, grit and violence mean a strange melancholy power stirs to life occasionally, but you never know where it's going.Kristen Scott Thomas is the only genuinely good actor in this, as Ryan Gosling barely speaks and the others don't get much to do. You never grow tired of the amazing cinematography, but this is a film which needs analysing and explanation to enjoy. Its violence is part of the style, but it can go overboard. OGF is an example of a film where restraint, although a good thing in many ways, actually lets the film down, showing less isn't always more. The lack of action set pieces and emphasis on atmosphere and depth is great and I have some admiration for the film for that, but it's a movie that leaves you cold since you don't know where its going. There's not really a point in the end, and while I occasionally noticed visual metaphors and symbols, they never amounted to anything or helped with my overall reading of this disappointing let down. I'd like to see Drive, because at least that one clearly has something to say. Small fights and tense outbreaks of violence are often better than action scenes and slow pace is often great, but only when supported by a good narrative. This movie certainly isn't, but it'll probably become a cult classic in future.4/10",Only God Forgives
73,DareDevilKid,A Surreal and Languorous Journey Down a Dark Path,7,30 July 2013,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.2/5 starsOkay, it might not be another ""Drive"", but it isn't anywhere close to how most critics and the general audience are making it out to be. The pace is deliberately slow and the performances are understandably languid, in keeping with the somber tone and brooding atmosphere of the film.Ryan Gosling once again makes for a strong lead character and renders an arresting performance that is etched in subtlety and finer nuances. He is ably complemented by Kristin Scott Thomas who delivers a ballsy act as the dominating matriarch of the crime syndicate with an incessant need to control and manipulate everything and everyone she comes in contact with.Most people are being unduly harsh on this movie. Nicolas Winding Refn has not created another masterpiece, but he has certainly hemmed another surreal tale, which exemplifies the sordidness of crime and repressed malevolent desires.",Only God Forgives
74,rubenm,This film is pure style,7,3 June 2013,"Basically, there are two kinds of films. Firstly, there are genre-pictures, using established cinematographic conventions, trying to please the audience. They may be good or bad, but are never shocking, disturbing or ground-breaking. Secondly, there are films ignoring conventions, and deliberately keeping distance from mainstream movie-making. Their aim is not necessarily to entertain, but rather to provoke, to shock or to disturb. They may be good or bad, but they don't leave the audience indifferent. Clearly, 'Only God Forgives' belongs to the latter group. The quality of this film is not about the plot twists, the character developments or the witty dialogue. There aren't any. This film is pure style. The only thing that matters is cinematography and atmosphere. And there's a lot of that. The film is set in Bangkok, which is shown as a dimly lit cityscape full of violent characters without any moral feeling. There's almost no daylight in the film, and neither any emotion. A senseless killing sets in motion a series of extremely violent acts. These are shown in settings full of contrasts - the most memorable and most violent scene takes place in a karaoke bar full of young women, watching the bloody proceedings in a state of pure indifference. The film sometimes is very slow. But this, and the very effective soundtrack, adds to the sinister atmosphere. One great scene shows a sort of garden, with a man and a young boy sitting in a corner. Very slowly, the camera moves towards them, while the music indicates something creepy is about to happen. You keep looking out for the danger that is supposed to be hiding in a corner, but then the film cuts and the camera angle reverses 180 degrees, so that the audience sees what the man and the boy see: an army of corrupt cops, with the most sadistic one in the front row. In this film, the acting is not about showing emotions, but rather about hiding them. An easy job for Ryan Gosling, who only has to show a poker face and act cool. It's Kristin Scott-Thomas who's stealing the show in this film. Her role is miles away from the British stiff-upper-lipped parts or the French character roles she is most famous for. She plays a super vulgar woman without any conscience, and she does it so well that I doubt if I would have recognized her if I wouldn't have known she was in the cast. The thing that struck me most about this film is how Asian it seems to be. Not only the emotionless acting and the stylish cinematography, but also the extreme, almost sadistic violence is something you wouldn't expect from a Danish director. He himself seems indeed to emphasize this, by using Thai characters for the opening and end credits.",Only God Forgives
75,christophe92300,Classic NWR,3,27 October 2013,"Winding Refn stayed true to himself with this Only God Forgives, and this time, it seems the public is starting to realize the Danish may be an excellent visual technician, but when it comes to telling a story — which is the main goal of a movie —, he does a poor job.And even here, the form sometimes becomes caricatural, not to say ridiculous, with those stylistic effects (slow motion, twilight, for example) pushed to the extreme, that serve as a disguise for an obvious empty script. Because this is where the problem lies with NWR. The plot is ultra basic, outrageously stretched, and the narration is painful, too choppy due to abrupt transitions that break the dynamic of the story.The film lasts only 1h30, but it's boring, nothing much happens and the few developments offered are extremely predictable. And on top of everything, once again, you have to endure that exacerbated violence always hard to justify.",Only God Forgives
76,dragokin,Valhalla Rising meets Drive in southeast Asia,2,24 August 2013,"It seems that Nicolas Winding Refn tried to bring together the visual appeal of Valhalla Rising with some plot elements of Drive. There is nothing essentially wrong with this approach. There are authors that built entire careers upon filming one and the same movie with slightly altered plot in different settings. And when you do the same thing repeatedly once in a while you'll inevitably create something of the extraordinary. Unfortunately Only God Forgives falls outside that group.The pace is slower than in both Refn's previous efforts. At times it is uncertain whether this is intentional or a weird experiment gone wrong. Violence is abundant but it is unclear why and how that should contribute to the artistic merit. At least we're spared Tarantino's waterfalls of blood in favor of gore. In order to supposedly bring this to a higher level, Refn adds dreamlike sequences and some Freudian moment in the plot.Ryan Gosling repeats his nearly voiceless character from Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines and is in this sense the weakest in the cast. Vithaya Pansringarm achieves a strong effect with limited means, although his role is nothing unusual in any B-class kung-fu movie. Kristin Scott Thomas is the best in the cast and brings to the screen an amazing mix of Eros and Thanatos. And she is the only reason i gave two stars.",Only God Forgives
77,RevRonster,Disappointment...,2,7 November 2013,"I was pretty excited for this film because I really liked ""Drive"" and Ryan Gosling is very talented. So, I was anticipating another great film from the Gosling/Nicolas Winding Refn team up. However, I was incredibly disappointed.The film has all the makings of being a dark, haunting tale of revenge as the cast is filled with astonishingly talented people, the tone is perfect for the story, the camera work is amazing and Refn has a very creative eye for disturbing thrillers. However, the end result just couldn't entertain me and it moved far too slowly and felt like it was going nowhere.In the end, the movie felt like the script was several dozen of pages too short and Refn had to compensate by padding out the film with a lot of scenes of the characters staring vacantly off camera. Sure, the violence in the film, on paper, seems like it's enough to shock the viewer out of the slumber that may have occurred during viewing but, when all is said and done, the film is basically just an hour and a half long staring contest.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies. So much so that I write a blog where I review and talk about whatever movie I am watching at the time. I have a more in-depth review of this film (and others) at revronmovies.blogspot.com",Only God Forgives
78,Al_The_Strange,I forgave this film,9,3 February 2014,"For much of 2013, it seemed like the movie's poster, with the dragon in neon lights, was beckoning me, perhaps even taunting me and daring me to watch this film. Since Drive was such a big hit just a couple of years earlier, this follow up from Nicolas Refn and Ryan Gosling looked like it'd be more of the same, but fans may find that Only God Forgives is a totally different animal of a film: many find it distasteful, weird, shallow, and just plain bad. I would have agreed with those assessments at first glance as well, but as with most works of art (especially in film), it took a fresh new viewing to look past the initial expectations and appreciate it as it is. This is not Drive; this is Valhalla Rising, with all the same primal brutality, but swapping out the lands of the Norse with the seedy grungy streets of Bangkok.This film moves with a slow and brooding pace, which will strain the patience of many viewers. For those with the patience, the film will be mesmerizing and hypnotic, thanks to the film's beautiful compositions and vivid lighting. Despite the pacing, most scenes rarely linger, and the film is pretty short overall; I think it's actually pretty notable that the film uses just as many scenes as it needs, cutting out the excess and keeping things simple.The story is pretty simple and small-scale, but the narrative is not easy to digest. Few words are spoken, and when they are, they're pretty quiet and they reveal very little. Most of the film's story is relayed best through its imagery and the characters' expressions; the burden of the pathos rests purely on the way the characters regard each other, the way they treat each other, and the way they take revenge on each other. Paying attention to these small nuances can reveal much about the characters, but without any straightforward answers, a lot of the story is left wide open to interpretation (and many viewers would probably dismiss it all as pretentious nonsense). As I regard the story, I believe it lays out some basic archetypes (especially on a theological level) and sets up a massive series of eye-for-an-eye conflicts that lead up to an expressionist finale. Ultimately, the characters go on to express themes of temptation, sin, vengeance, and authoritarian terror.All that being said, the story is hard to take at face value. Parts of it are hard to believe, if not outright unrealistic. Parts of it make little sense, and the finale is pretty weird.The film is as beautiful as they come. It boasts some superb photography and editing. Color and lighting are extremely vivid and powerful, painting each scene with bold imagery that drives the story and gives the whole thing meaning. Acting is notably odd; most actors are statuesque and silent, but their expressions, movements, and compositions are very nuanced. Writing is pretty minimalistic. This production uses some very good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Locales are authentic. Cliff Martinez's music score is pretty awesome and accentuates the visuals beautifully.Only God Forgives: it looks like the companion piece to Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void, and it feels like Stanley Kubrick. Its narrative and pacing is not nearly as palatable as Drive, and if you're expecting something on that level, you will likely be disappointed. But what the film lacks in narrative or straightforward dialogue, it makes up for with pure expressionism.Since the film is so polarizing, I'd only recommend renting this film first, to see if it can captivate you the way it's captivated me.4.5/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Perfect)",Only God Forgives
79,MelbaMan1,Style Over Substance,6,12 May 2018,"Beautifully (deceptively) quiet, shockingly violent, ultimately captivating. I can't remember when last I felt (in a good way) the director's presence in a movie so much. Still, a lot of it is style over substance. Never got emotionally involved with the characters or carried away with the plot. Like the girls in the club, I had to close my eyes when the violence got too bloody.

80,MovieCriticOnline,What did I just watch? Someone tell me..,1,5 March 2019,"How does the director go from a good movie like Drive to this and also Neon Demon? I never understood why directors can make a good film and then just make a total piece of garbage. Maybe he got lucky with Drive, but then continued to make a bunch of pretentious nonsensical art films.And Ryan Gosling needs to start TALKING in movies. He can't keep playing the silent lone character. This belongs in a weird arthouse somewhere. Everyone apparently has to move at snail speed.",Only God Forgives
81,moviemanMA,Coffee Table Movie,5,22 July 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn has made a career of shocking audiences, for better and for worse. Through all of his work there is one word I keep repeating: hypnotic. I've seen five of his films and all of them put me in a trance. The stories, the camera work, the ethereal music beds, and the performances. Everyone involved seems to know what Refn is aiming to make, and when it works we inevitably figure it out.In the case of Only God Forgives, I wish we knew what was going on.Sometimes a film seems like it has one or two inside jokes that the characters get but you don't necessarily understand. I feel like if I watched this with the cast and crew they would smirk at certain moments and nod at a particular line. I, on the other hand, would be left scratching my head.This is a film that after several viewings, probably similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master, would make more and more sense, and maybe even create an appreciation for what is being done. Some movies can pull it off. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one such a film. it gets better and better with each viewing. Though The Master doesn't quite deserve a revisit just yet (it does have quality performances), this film falls completely flat.It's a shame. A real shame. Refn is one of the most interesting filmmakers out there and his body of work shows it. He turns violence into an art form, where it's not just about special effects and blood curdling screams. He doesn't let violence carry on and on, barreling through walls and off of cars. Fighting hurts everyone, both the victim and the assailant. It's a very emotional experience with lots of blood, sweat, and swelling. That's what we saw in Drive, Valhalla Rising, and Bronson. That's not what we see here with OGF.Now, I'm not advocating violence by any means. Violence when photographed and presented correctly can show humans at their most primal level. Here we have a lot of violent people, but there's no motive, nothing driving them to such violent acts. In Drive, the Driver is on his own. He must fight to survive, but he would rather use his wheels do the talking. The villain is an old, mean gangster with no patience to rant and torture his victims. His violent acts are done with purpose and precision. In OGF we have a lot of violent people, none of which we ever truly get to know. Julian (Gosling) is a fighter (maybe) who runs a Thai boxing gym as a front for his mothers drug trafficking. He doesn't say much (less than in Drive if you can believe it) but he has a look about him that says...well, I'm not sure what it says. He's almost like a puppy. When his brother is killed his mother comes to seek revenge, hoping that Julian will help out. He doesn't. We find out later that he may or may not have been jealous of his brother's relationship with his mother, but we're never told anything that is the honest to God truth. You can't trust any of the characters...except the detective who wields a katana and slices up everything that moves.I really don't want to go into the details because there isn't much and most of it is speculative. There are a few dream sequences (maybe) and one fight with Gosling, who may or may not be a good fighter. He sometimes has a temper but he also has a good side. His mother has no redeeming qualities and is pretty nasty to everyone. The detective leads a pretty wholesome life when he isn't stabbing, slicing, impaling, or gouging his way through the movie.So the takeaways? Well, it looks pretty. This would probably serve better as a coffee table book than an actual movie. I would rather just look at a few images than an hour and half of synth tones, neon lights, and sword slashing. Honestly, watch the trailer. It tells a much more precise story and is more easy to understand. Hell, the trailer is actually pretty awesome (there is also a red band trailer that is more like a short Refn film).Only God Forgives isn't an unforgivable sin. I don't even think it needs an apology. Refn clearly made a film that HE wanted to make. He has earned it in my book. Now that he has it out of his system I'm hoping he gets back to basics and starts making more films like Drive, Bronson, and Pusher. The ball is in your court Mr. Refn.",Only God Forgives
82,LloydBayer,Be careful what you wish for.,7,23 July 2013,"Following the success of the shock and awe machismo in DRIVE, director Nicholas Winding Refn returns with another strong dose of violence that has now become his institutionalized insignia. We wanted an encore and ONLY GOD FORGIVES has everything we have grown to expect from Refn – a story of revenge prescribed through gruesome violence, told in a chronological and evenly paced narrative, and set within an atmosphere abundant in style and mood. But within these parameters, Refn tells a simple story that can't seem to decide if it is art-house circa, or camp bloodletting by way of impertinent freedom of speech. And this is probably one of the reasons why ONLY GOD FORGIVES was booed at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The other reason is obvious – an overindulgence in style with little or no substance. To be fair, we asked for it, and Refn responded with a concentrated formula derived from his preceding films. Now there is no going back. It is a matter of whether or not we were wise in what we wished for. Joining Refn is Ryan Gosling in a role almost parallel to his introvert in DRIVE. Deeply conflicted, Gosling's Julian is an American expatriate who runs a Muay Thai fight club in Bangkok; a front for a drug syndicate he operates with older brother Billy (Tom Burke). A suggestively themed background story creeps up later in the film, revealing just how sociopathic both brothers are. When Billy is lethally punished for the demon that he is, Refn's script unleashes not one, but two unapologetic characters that propel the narrative into a mesmerizing mode of madness and mayhem. The first is plain clothes policeman Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), an angel of vengeance, or perhaps the titular God, loathsome of the putrefying influence foreigners have on his people, and how low his people have stooped to appease said foreigners. The second is Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), a repugnant racist who arrives to avenge her son's death, and in the process, navigates a war path through Bangkok's lethal underworld. Caught between his mother's murderous cry for revenge and Chang's unflinching brand of justice, Julian must either overpower his past or face the consequences coming his way. One of my main disappointments is the fact that Gosling has nothing to work with. Punctuating frequent scenes of long hard stares into nothingness are a couple of words here and there and perhaps one or two sentences in the entire film. For the most part, Gosling maintains a passive-until-provoked demeanor but this changes towards the end when we realize Julian is not what he appears to be, nor anywhere near his Brando-esque persona in DRIVE. Contradicting Gosling's mime is Thomas, almost unrecognizable as a high maintenance peroxide blonde with an American accent. A far cry from her Academy Award nominated role in THE English PATIENT, Thomas' mere presence as the venomous Crystal makes it uncomfortable for on-screen characters and viewers alike. But even as her acid spitting dialogue is tasteless, these scenes crackle with wry humor. Watch out for the scene where Julian brings his prostitute-girlfriend to the dinner table. And then there is Pansringarm's Chang, whose main job is dishing out the film's most brutal scenes thanks to a well concealed weapon of choice. Except for some mistimed karaoke scenes, Pansringarm has hardly anything to say and his Chang appears to be in some sort of trance, but this character turns out to be the brute force we expected from Gosling. Despite a disappointing story that begins and ends in obscurity, ONLY GOD FORGIVES had me clamped to my seat because almost every scene is hypnotic in nature. Using ambient lighting from neon-lit saturation of primary colors, Larry Smith's cinematography is nothing short of aesthetic brilliance. Refn uses this in long takes, both static and sweeping, to create introspective expressions on key characters. On par with the cinematography is the atmospheric score from Cliff Martinez – an electronic fusion of pent up energy reverberating through some of the best scenes in the film and essentially giving the narrative its dark tone. All this boils down to how this film is perceived. If you have 'acquired a taste' for Refn's movies, there is the possibility that you will find this movie intriguing. If not, you will lose the plot right from the start.",Only God Forgives
83,peefyn,Refn focuses so much on atmosphere that he forgets the characters,4,9 January 2016,"If this movie only had a some more interesting characters. The movie is so close to being really good, but it seems like it chooses to focus on mood or atmosphere, instead of the characters. A plot as simple as this one (basically a series of revenge killings) could still work as a great movie, but when the characters in it are completely devoid of life, you end up not caring.There is so much to like about this movie, that it is a pity that it just doesn't work. The visuals are great, and does evoke the feeling of moral depravity. The slow pace works really well, leaving the silence feel heavy. When there's music, it's usually good, fitting the style of the movie completely. And the setting is great. I love the locations they use. The actors are all good, both the English, American and the Thai. As mentioned before, a plot as simple as this could work (though doesn't, in this case).I can't imagine wanting to watch this movie again, despite all of the good things that can be said for it.

84,samkan,"Great Bogeyman, Poor Film",5,5 December 2013,"If you don't feel like you have wasted your money after seeing ONLY GOD FORGIVES it is because of Vithaya Pansringarm's Chang, who is among the most intimidating cinema characters I have ever encountered! I think if I ever ran into Chang I would, after soiling myself, just ask him what part of my body he wanted to sever or split and be done with it. I'm thinking Chang can probably dodge bullets too. Forget the Chuck Norris hyperbole and metaphor, Chang makes Chuck look like chopped liver (pun intended). Unfortunately, OGF is an art film sans the art. Excruciatingly long pregnant pauses soon become stupefying. The mother-from-hell's demeanor and language is supposed to be crass contrast but instead comes off as comic relief. If Pansringarm and Gosling's characters are supposed to have backgrounds that explain their actions the version of OGF I saw omitted such. I'm sure there's merit to the book this film was based on. I'm sure the author spilled his guts, split his sides (pun intended again) at the big screen version of his work.",Only God Forgives

I would say that the benefit of watching this movie is entirely from the visuals were it excels. Unfortunately after a while the blood-red and, often, bizarre scenes become a bit boring.The story, well you have it in the movie blurb above. There is not much more to it and it is just used to tie the string of artistic expressions of the director/writer together. This is a quite violent movie. The old cop, Chang, gets more than one opportunity to use various sharp instruments, mostly his sword, on various criminal elements and the effects are frequently shown in all their gory glory.What about the actors and their performance? Well it is quite good for this type of movie but having said that the acting mostly consists of various people silently staring at each other.I had quite a bit of difficulty in deciding what rating I should give this movie. If I would go by the visuals only it should be very high but if I would go by the rest of the content it would be rather low.

86,rooee,Unforgivable,2,27 July 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn, who successfully explored the violence at the heart of man in his mythic Valhalla Rising, has made a follow-up to Drive which shares that film's neon aesthetic and apathetic mood, but slows everything down even further and ramps up the gore even more. I don't have a problem with a filmmaker hating the world, but if he wants us to hate it too, he's got to come up with a less boring and risible argument than this.Ryan Gosling, stolid as ever, plays Julian, an American drug dealer living in Bangkok. When his brother is murdered, their mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas, cast against type and looking uncomfortable for it), rolls into town to demand revenge.The film is basically a procession of synth-scored atmosphere shots punctuated by bouts of physical and verbal aggression.There are potential themes floating somewhere in its melting pot of tasteless stylish elements. It becomes apparent that Julian is on the run after committing a murder; therefore we assume his odyssey is one of seeking forgiveness. There's even a scene where he's washing his hands and blood comes out of the tap. Blood on his hands, see. Symbolism, that is.I momentarily enjoyed the amusing irony that Crystal's cruelty toward Julian renders him impotent, and thus removes her last line of defence against imminent death. But, lest we mistake him for anything but a SERIOUS FILMMAKER, Winding Refn has no real fun with this, either. It's just another sub-Michael Mann mood moment, full of careful colour and drained of any significance.As a showcase for lighting, mood, and composition, Only God Forgives is a triumph. But there's a whole lot more in the cinematic toolbox, if only Winding Refn would get stuck in.",Only God Forgives

88,kgprophet,Director's Commentary Doesn't Help Much in Translating this Mess,4,27 October 2013,"I became an instant fan of both Director Nicolas Refn and Actor Ryan Gosling after seeing ""Drive"", their last collaboration. There was a very distinct style that had a great deal of thought behind it. It was a smart screenplay and well acted. So I was perplexed at how OGF got kind of swept under the rug. With a high profile actor, it still could not even muster a showing on a single screen in the Twin Cities during it's run.With dismal reviews, I was curious about what the director would have to say about this film by listening to his commentary on the DVD. Refn certainly goes into great detail, explaining the symbolism of each shot. He also explains that he removed a great deal of dialogue because it didn't work. He instead wants the audience to interpret the visuals to fill in the dialogue themselves.But, judging by the intricate story he describes, all that symbolism and nuance is not translated well by the silent stares given by Gosling, co-star Kristin Scott Thomas, and villain Vithaya Pansringarm. This film clocks in at 90 minutes, but still has little momentum. Perhaps Refn is channeling David Lynch, modeling the film structure like ""Lost Highway"". Characters move and talk slowly, and the movie is more about the atmosphere itself than what dialogue transpires to any great degree. I don't give Refn much credit if he is mimicking Lynch. The extreme lighting and simple settings our characters inhabit are not blurring the line between dream and reality successfully.I have not seen Pangsringarm before, but obviously he is a veteran actor who has a menacing presence on screen with a disturbing calm in his eyes. He is the only one that survives this film with a winning role. I don't hold this experiment against Refn, who is still early in his career, but it did seem to end the collaboration between him and Gosling. I look forward to a properly budgeted project with a type of script where Refn can apply his unique touch. His potential genius was glimpsed in ""Drive"", I expect better things to come.",Only God Forgives
89,OttoVonB,The Audience Never Forgives,5,28 July 2014,"Nicolas Winding Refn knows how to make real cinema. A quick glance through the likes of Valhalla Rising, Drive and especially Bronson should be all the proof you need. After these three films though, the growing question was, can he tell a story? The answer finally lands with a loud thud as the end credits to Only God Forgives crawl onto the screen: not really.That is not to dismiss or cheapen his considerable accomplishments, particularly in the 3 earlier works, as a visual artist, and a creator of atmosphere. His particular style begs for a strong - not to be confused with sympathetic - lead character to anchor the unique universe he unleashes upon his viewers. Mads Mikkelsen had the aura of mystery and unbearable suffering to make this work. Tom Hardy transcended the challenge. Ryan Gosling bravely broke himself down to primary colors for his stoic outsider in Drive. The trick is getting harder to repeat and every fundamental layer Winding Refn peels away from his films piles new responsibilities on his lead actor's shoulders. Sadly with Only God Forgives he has reached both the limits of the medium and of his leading man.On the plus side, it is an intriguing affair to watch, moody as hell and beautiful to behold, with a hypnotic turn from Vithaya Pansringarm as an oddly likable angel of death. You could watch him just sit still and stare into space and it would be fascinating in itself, which is a good thing, as that's mostly what the film has in store for you. Winding Refn's Bangkok is a suffocating, neon-lit hellhole that manages to convey more filth and unease than the parodies portrayals depicted in most American films. But then there's the parade of empty shells the film has for characters, and it's hard to give yourself fully to the atmosphere when the human element is so undercooked. Scott Thomas' toxic mother would have been a treat if she weren't dragged down by one cliché line after the next, at least she's more engaging than any of the other cyphers who populate the film.And then there is Ryan Gosling. While his beyond-minimalist work here might have been universally praised in a more mainstream, classically-structured film, you can't escape the feeling that Winding Refn hung him out to dry. In a sense, it is extremely brave of him to appear so naked and blank, just a floating spirit in a kaleidoscopic hell, but if that was the intended metaphor, then this hell is too bland for the journey to matter or really engage. And if his character, Julian, doesn't care about anything, why should we?It will be very interesting to see what director and star do next - if they choose to collaborate again - but Only God Forgives proves that the experiment has reached a limit. Time to branch off into another direction, or take that final, huge leap into the void.",Only God Forgives
90,Tak005,Grossly violent,1,14 February 2020,"This film may have a deep meaning, however, it has been lost in grossly excessive violence and sexual perversion. From the opening scene of the movie till its end it is just one long dark moment.",Only God Forgives
91,x_manicure_x,"Memorable, but not for good reasons",4,24 August 2021,"""Only God Forgives"" is the ultimate example that the most personal and uncompromising work of a filmmaker is not always his best. Unlike most people have been saying, this film shares many common traits with Refn's most famous work ""Drive"": a stylized plot to allow complete focus on the aesthetics and atmosphere, characters who stay quiet and let the images talk instead, emphasis on the city and its urban landscapes, a silent hero with an ambiguous ethical code, twisted violence used as some kind of artistic fetish, men seeking for redemption as they keep fighting forces that are far greater than themselves. So why didn't the formula work this time?""Only God Forgives"" sees Refn rowing against the current at all costs and dropping all intent to please his audience, as if he was asked to prove his artistic integrity after having achieved mainstream success. I guess people didn't like that Ryan Gosling this time impersonates a pathetic loser with rotten feelings, continuously manipulated by his deranged and vengeful mother. Honestly, that was actually the only interesting thing I could find in the whole movie. Despite Gosling's bloated performance, his character brings with him the existentialist and introspective nature of this film. It's the key to decipher all symbols and visual nonsense. His mother Crystal is perfectly portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas, but her character ends up being overly stylized and cartoonish, a little more than a swearing machine with boobs. Crystal's opponent Chang is a cruel executioner that resembles the God from the Old Testament, able to forgive those who violate his principles but not without proper punishment. He connects well with the mystical, alienating atmosphere that permeates the film, but I couldn't stop laughing every time he was swirling his machete around.It felt just like one more pretentious, self-indulgent film that will definitely stay in my mind for decades, but that due to the naive and careless writing failed to communicate anything more than formal beauty.",Only God Forgives

But beyond being fiscally responsible for his investors, Refn has taken many steps backwards, producing something very immature. It's neon lit nonsense for 90 minutes without a modicum of restraint. For a film that is so director and DP centric, it's a surprisingly lifeless film. May I suggest for the future, feeding Gosling some amphetamines or Ritalin before each scene - not Vicodin or some other opiate. If this is what Refn needed to make to get out of his system so he can then grow as a filmmaker, I understand. He made the film he wanted to. Now please show progress as the talented filmmaker you are. There's soulless generic products released every week to theaters and this is a film fueled with passion. It shows. It really does. It's a one of a kind disaster. The kind of film you can practically see the director giving the middle finger to the audience.",Only God Forgives

And 'Only God Forgives' is the film that shows us what that is like. I mean he only says 17 lines and is in 75% of the movie. The oddest part is, I was never bored in this film. It follows Julian and his mother as they hunt down the man that killed their son/brother. And that's about it. The real story is in the subtly between characters and the implications that each scene holds. Few other films are this thin but this interesting. I found myself consistently trying to unravel the plot and all the on screen metaphors. It's all captured by the confident hand of Nicolas Winding Refn. This being his first film following the hugely successful 'Drive'. If you can believe it, 'Only God Forgives' is even more stylish than 'Drive'. The production design captures Bangkok in an elegantly dark way. The film uses neon lights, boxing arenas, dark hallways, and quiet streets to show the culture of the city. It gives the city life and the film a distinct style. This seems to add to the performances we see. Which are all pretty great. It's obvious at this point that actors respond better when they are in real environments rather than in a green or blue room acting against nothing.And everyone in the film gives excellent performances that really explore their character. Gosling is a broken man on the run from his old life, desperately trying to start new. His mother, on the other hand, is trying to force him to be the way she wants. Having these interesting characters in a scene together helped immensely with the atmosphere the film is going for.Gosling sits and stares as his mother verbally abuses him. It made the scenes they shared easily the best of the film. But when they aren't sharing scenes it was hard to really get into it. I understand what the film was going for, but many of the scenes felt unnecessary. While others really didn't make any sense.Like the overly gory ""action"" scenes. Which weren't really action scenes at all. They usually consisted of one character slashes someone else with a short sword. Each one of these scenes didn't feel earned. It's hard to get into an action movie that only has action for sake of action. When there isn't any emotion or anything at stake it's not action, it's boring. I like to watch movies that rely on their story or characters to carry you through. But movies that rely completely on you being able to find the symbolism and nothing else are just not that entertaining.I wish I liked this film more. The characters were interesting, the film stylish, and there was more than enough subtly with the story. But the whole thing didn't really know where to go with itself. It wandered between some scenes that mattered and others that most definitely should have been cut. It relies so heavily on symbolism that it's hard to enjoy the story. I would say watch this for the undeniably unique vision and complex plot but be wary, you will probably get bored real quick.",Only God Forgives
94,CountJonnie,"Succeeds in style, fails everywhere else",4,21 June 2017,"Refn surprised us with Drive. Drive offered a minimum of dialogue, but without having the story and acting suffer from it. Alas, OGF takes it too far.OFG is made of something that could have been a story about a man and his crime of life, smothered by his mother, a cruel and vulnerable personality hidden behind his stoic appearance and victim of people who are worse, after his search for whom killed his brother.Symbols could and should be used to tell an underlying story and to tell that which can't be expressed in words. But OGF does this by pointless silences, pointless staring, pointless acting stoic and pointless.....nothingness.The movie drowns you in feelings, emotions, colors, symbols and suggestions, but none take a direction. Things just.....happen. And while the story (or the lack of it) goes slower and slower into nothingness, the ability to understand the story, or to feel for the characters will completely disappear. Chances are that you reach this point halfway the movie, and wonder if you need to continue.I can only attempt to summarize this vague dream: A revenge story turns into a colorful and symbolic experience than can be compared to drowning into nothingness. You can enjoy that, but you probably won't.",Only God Forgives
95,squirrel_burst,"Gorgeous movie, but filled with unlikeable characters.",4,24 November 2014,"""Only God Forgives"" looks terrific; the use of colour is nothing short of brilliant and the cinematography jumps out as particularly strong as well. Too bad the movie as a whole is plain ugly and the entirety of its characters completely unlikeable. When Billy (Tom Burke) is discovered by a Bangkok police officer after having raped and murdered a 16-year-old girl, he finds the girl's father and lets the man (Kovit Wattanakul) beat the murderer to death. When she hears the news, Billy's mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) is outraged and demands revenge. She asks her second-born son, Julian (Ryan Gosling) to grant her satisfaction in an increasing spiral of violence.When I say the characters in this movie are totally unlikeable, I meant it literally. I don't mean in the way that some people would call an anti-hero unlikeable because he or she doesn't obey the rules. I don't use the term in the way a flawed character might be considered unlikeable because he or she needs to show improvement and growth throughout the film. I mean these are terrible people that you want to see boiled alive in oil, eaten slowly by a pack of wild dogs or murdered with a sandblaster. The character who drives the action of the film, Billy, is a pedophile, a rapist, a violent misogynist and a drug dealer. When this guy was killed, I was sorry only in the sense that I didn't get to do see it on-screen. When his mother comes into play, you hate her even more. When Julian informs her that ""Billy raped and killed a 16-year-old girl"" and that's why someone figured he was no longer fit to live, her answer is ""I'm sure he had his reasons"". Wow. What I wouldn't give to splice this movie with that final scene from ""Hellraiser"", so I could see these characters get torn apart with Pinhead's hook-chains. If that wasn't bad enough, she's a domineering, verbally abusive racist who might have had incestuous relationships with her children (at least one of them). Julian isn't much better either. I think the objective of the film is to have him as a sort of neutral character, who is torn between obeying his mother and thinking that Billy got what he deserved, but it doesn't work. To think that he is a likable character you would have to ignore the fact that he is spineless block of wood with basically no personality, has a tendency to assault strangers for no reason and that he commits several murders himself throughout the film. I'm not talking about bad people exclusively either, I'm talking about police officers who were just doing their jobs that got in his way. I found his character even more unlikeable when towards the end of the film he shows conflict over killing a little girl. Oh I see, it's bad to kill children but if you're killing their fathers, their brothers, their mothers or their nannies it doesn't bother you eh? Give me a break. This character is not likable and no bullshit ending (and this movie has a bullshit ending) can convince us otherwise.If you stretched yourself, you might be able to like one of two secondary characters in the film. One is the prostitute that Julian frequents, who at least has the sense to call the mother out for the bitch that she is. The other is the cop responsible for getting Billy killed. Even then I couldn't get behind this character. Yeah he's a supercop who gets the job done in an ugly world, but he also tortures several people so brutally that you want to disconnect yourself from him (mostly because he treats it as standard police procedure, not as a personal vendetta). He also seems to really pick and choose at random who deserves to be punished, with some people who have suffered a lot getting punished even further by his hand, and others who deserve a severe punishment by any country's standards getting off not necessarily easy, but not in a way that's equal to the other people he dispenses justice towards.In the movie's defense, it's got a lot of style, some great cinematography and an excellent use of colour. I also found the acting to be pretty good and the special effects to be convincing as well. For an hour and a half of your time though, this really doesn't offer much. It's filled with confusing dream sequences and ambiguous moments of morality, awful characters you couldn't care less for and a story that in the end doesn't really mean anything. It wasn't an unpleasant experience for the most part because the movie looks good, but it just left me feeling dirty and disappointed. (On DVD, July 5, 2014)",Only God Forgives
96,trublu215,Brutally beautiful,6,15 July 2013,"After hearing all the poor reviews coming out of Cannes this past year, I was concerned due to the fact that Drive, Refn's last film, was brilliant. However, I gave this a shot and I must say all of the negative reviews surrounding this film are misleading. For those of you expecting Drive in Bangkok, please don't watch this because you'll be very disappointed. Only God Forgives is a deeper film than Drive, metaphorically. Due to its blending of Kubrick style camera work and signature Refn violence, it makes for an interesting watch to say the least. The imagery on screen is haunting. Whether it is Ryan Gosling beating a man and dragging him down a hallway by his jaw or seeing countless people slain with a Katana, it keeps your attention visually. On the script side of things, the film doesn't make a whole lot of sense without really researching what Nicolas Winding Refn was trying to convey to the audience. The story seems broken and fragmented throughout which makes it ridiculously hard to keep track of what is going on. But when you do get to a scene that progresses the story, you realize that the fifteen minutes in between meaningful scenes is bogged down with imagery of Ryan Gosling brooding or Kristen Scott Thomas laying down a profanity laced dialog telling Gosling's Julian to find his brother's killer. It makes for an interesting watch to say the least. The performances are good but don't expect any great memorable characters. Ryan Gosling is rehashing his performance in Drive, so much so that the characters of Driver and Julian are mirror images of one another. I believe he only has 20 or so lines throughout the film, which would be fine if he wasn't the main character. But with Ryan Gosling, the man is such a brilliant actor that he can convey about 75% of what he is feeling through mere facial expressions. However, the Julian character is so complex that 20 or so lines does not do him justice. We can only guess what he is thinking for so long before we start getting annoyed. Kristen Scott Thomas was utterly fantastic as a bitch mother with an appetite for mayhem and incest. Her performance is definitely the highlight of the film.Nicolas Winding Refn definitely directs the hell out of the shot and his actors but fails to deliver any substance to the film's story as it never really progresses, it just reacts. The film, however, is hardly a failure as the Cannes audience made it out to be. It is a splatter film very much so, it is brutal, it is violent, and really haunting in certain scenes. If you're a fan of cinema, and independent films then this is a subliminal treat for you. If you're the everyday movie goer, I would advise against it just for the mere fact that it is an experimental film with A list actors.Overall, this is a brutally violent film that is beautiful at the same time. The visual elements of every frame will keep your eyes occupied, even if a silent Ryan Gosling won't.",Only God Forgives
97,masoncheek,Not as good as Drive.,7,29 July 2020,"I guess expecting a slow paced movie helped the overall experience, but I thought it was decent. Nicolas Winding Refn has talent especially in cinematography. So yeah 7/10 works.",Only God Forgives
98,darkreignn,"Constantly enthralling, even if it's light on straight-forward narrative",7,6 February 2021,"""Time to meet the devil,"" Tom Burke's Billy utters to Julian, played by Ryan Gosling, early on in the film. Who, or what, is the devil that Billy is referring to? Is Billy talking about himself who will be meeting this devil, or is Bill telling Julian that Julian will be the one meeting the devil? Those questions, and more, are all thought provoking sentiments that ""Only God Forgives"" poses, and leaves it up to viewers to answer.""Only God Forgives"" is Nicolas Winding Refn's follow up to ""Drive"" - no doubt even more polarizing than that film. Taking the stoic, quiet performances and ultra violence from the previous movie and amplifying it past a level that mainstream audiences would have been comfortable with, it's not a surprise that ""Only God Forgives"" was booed at Cannes. It's also not a surprise that it was applauded. ""Only God Forgives"" offers a slow but briskly paced story that revels in its minimalism, the beauty lying in the fact that its viewer gets to decide for themselves what everything means.There are many interpretations of this movie out there, and practically all of them I disagree with. And that's okay, because this movie wants you to watch it intently, digest every scene, ever frame, and ponder on what you're seeing. Some may call this film pretentious, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. On the other hand, it's purposefully obtuse nature calls for endless rewatchability, meaning you'll pick up on something new with every viewing.As is usual with the films of Nicolas Winding Refn, ""Only God Forgives"" looks and sounds incredible - gone are the brightly lit and cheery, upbeat pop songs of ""Drive,"" instead replaced by a deep, dark synth soundtrack that goes wonderfully with the equally as dark setting. Bright neon reds and blues light up the screen, casting everything in an unsettling, ethereal glow. It sounds great, and looks even better, which makes for a fittingly hypnotizing experience. Long stretches without dialogue that would be boring in any other film are enthralling because of the show this movie gives your eyes and ears. However, that's not to say that the visuals and soundtrack are the only things this movie has going for it.From the jump, ""Only God Forgives"" feels uncomfortable - perhaps because of its surreal setting, or its ominous soundtrack - in my eyes, however, it is because of its plot. A classic revenge story, at least on paper, this film subverts expectations and ups the stakes by making its lead character unwilling to take revenge, an understandable choice when you come to see the events that set the plot in motion unfold. This unique eye-for-an-eye tale gets flipped on its head, which may upset, or enthrall, viewers. I found this change of pace welcome, as it opened the door to many unpredictable scenarios and meaningful character building, practically all done through Refn's signature slow and steady style.Yes, Ryan Gosling once again plays a quiet hero (or perhaps, anti-hero) who stays stoic for the majority of the running time. But if you pay attention, there is real and tangible character development taking place - as there is plot momentum. Just because this movie is slow and quiet doesn't mean things aren't happening to move the story forward. There is a story that's being told here; it is small-scale and minimalistic, but a story nevertheless. It will ultimately be up to you whether you not only enjoy the story but the way it is told; it goes without saying that this isn't a film for everyone.Packed with mean dialogue, over the top violence, and lurid scenarios, ""Only God Forgives"" will be sure to send shivers down the spine of even the most hardened film fans. I still feel uncomfortable watching the beginning of this movie. However, it's style, sound, and story all come together in a way that's unlike any other action-thriller. This isn't a perfect movie - I wish Refn would've harnessed the plot a bit more and tightened it up, as he does in ""Drive"" and ""The Neon Demon,"" both films where he enhances the plot with his surrealistic style, in comparison to this movie where he seems to use the plot as an excuse for surrealistic images. Regardless, for a pure cinematic experience in sight and sound, ""Only God Forgives"" delivers in spades.",Only God Forgives
99,martinrobertson300482,"""What? Is that it?""",5,8 September 2013,"The Only problem I had with the much praised ""Drive,"" Was that I thought it was supposed to be something else. The fact that it was called ""Drive"" had me thinking it was an action movie. Or at least had some Cars in it. So when it wasn't about either of these things, I couldn't help but be disappointed with it in the strangest of ways. Even if it was great for what it was.I thought I had a better idea of what I was walking into this time with ""Only God forgives,"" but it turns out I didn't. This one has the same slow, stylish atmosphere that worked before, but perhaps over does it. Its one of those professionally made arty films, which (Once I got past the very strange first 20 minutes) I was ready to lap up. The Problem is, it doesn't really go anywhere with it.Ryan Gosling Keeps his mouth shut and stares down the camera most of the time. As do a lot of the cast. When everyone is doing this, can you really call it a film full of ""great performances?"" The stand out performance is from Kristen Scott Thomas. Who is actually great as Gosling's lippy mother. But she is maybe the only thing worth seeing in this. After sitting through lots of shots of long corridors, and weird imagery, I was wanting a pay-off. Which is something ""Only God forgives"" doesn't deliver. Its abrupt ending, and mere 90 minute running time made sure of that.I think it might have been the first time i've been in the cinema and the audience wasn't sure whether it was all finished or not. Lots of people looking around, asking ""What? Is that it?"" is no good thing.",Only God Forgives
100,Jerghal,David Lynchian,9,10 November 2013,After 'Drive' Refn brings us this dark descent into the Bangkok underworld. 'Only God Forgives' is the most David Lynchian film I ever saw not actually made by Lynch himself. It has a ominous brooding atmosphere created by the foreboding music and beautiful dark cinematography. Most shots are locked-off or slow moving tracking shots. Every frame is like an excellently framed and composited photograph with gorgeous colors and contrast. The short bursts of graphically extreme violence are countered by the calmness in the acting and filmmaking. The violence lingers beneath the surface as it does in our human nature. 'Only God Forgives' maybe not as accessible and won't be as well-liked as 'Drive' but for me it was a better movie and well above my expectations. I highly recommend it but I can't guarantee you'll like it as well as this might be a matter of personal taste ;),Only God Forgives
101,mistoppi,Anyone who liked Drive should see this,6,5 June 2015,"I am very surprised. If you think about the story as simplified as it is in the summary, this movie could be very simple, very simple and typical crime drama. But no, Only God Forgives was far from simple and typical. It was way more artistic than I thought it would be.The pace in this movie was slow, kind of reminded me of Kubrick's The Shining. The cinematography was interesting; it was colorful and mysterious. It added partially weird atmosphere to the movie. And when you combine the slow pace, amazing cinematography and the surreal feeling of the movie, the result was astonishing. I never would've thought that a crime drama with such a simple plot would turn out to be a really artistic movie. I was expecting something like Drive, but tiny bit worse and simpler. Most of this movie felt like some kind of more artistic, dreamlike scene you could add near the end of otherwise simple movie.Only God Forgives didn't sugarcoat or hide disturbing violence, and the dialog was as rough as needed.

102,Tcarts76,"Odd, Bizarre, but mostly boring",2,21 July 2013,"""Only God Forgives,"" is one of those movies I wish I could forgive Nicholas Winding Refn for making...but I can't. There is nothing really good I can say about this one. As for Refn, using an actor like Ryan Gosling was a genius move since it will probably put backsides in the seats, but that is clearly what the entire budget went to because the story will put everyone to sleep.There is a lot of violence, blood and guts stuff, much like ""Vahalla Rising,"" but beyond that this movie is just dumb. It mostly comprised of shots of Gosling in various degrees of Thai neon lights, in the streets and whore houses of Thailand. Plenty of Thai ladies who are posed around more like mannequins and more as pieces of sets than anything else. The ""bad guy"" is equally as stupid. It is almost as if Refn put an add in the Thai papers to find a slightly out of shape, older Thai man that liked to swing a machete, walk the streets like a robot, and that is pretty much it. There is almost zero dialog in the movie.If this movie were made in 1970, it might have been a decent art flick. As it is, it is a waste of your time, your money, and your brain. Sitting at home and staring at the wall would probably be time well spent compared to this stupid disaster. This really is becoming the story for Refn. He produces a few decent movies like ""Bronson"" and ""Drive,"" but then puts out nonsense like this one ""Only God Forgives,"" and ""Vahalla Rising."" I don't know, maybe its a European thing, hating yourself for putting out a good movie, so punishing your audience by putting out a painfully bad one? Just say don't to this movie.

He brings the murder victims father to the scene, and introduces him to the murderer, Billy, then the father introduces a baseball bat to Billy's skull, sweet revenge right?

As Julian is faced with his mothers rage over his decision to set free man that murdered his brother and also that man faced a punishment for that from Chang, a man who believes that he is above all. Throughout movie Julian is being doubtful, as we learned earlier he killed his father with his bare hands and now he faces a challenges over and over again. His mother Crystal is a terrifying women that projects pure evil over everybody and in doing so humiliates others but also considers she is all right in doing so. Chang is satanist that believes he has a power in deciding what is right and what is not but in doing so his intentions are just directed into hurting others. Ending where Julian is standing and Chang draws his sword is probably moment where he finally achieved what he always wanted to be able to stop Julian which could surpass him in evil and horror that he is able to do but only with Julian's acceptance because his doubts turned out to the good side. Visually impressive movie with some of the most brutal and terrifying scenes ever on screen.

Acting was what the director wanted them to be, non expressive, but the characters were well defined and they worked well for the story. I mostly liked the character Chang, I didn't see him as a villain, I think the point is that there's no real hero in this movie.. The story was simple and straight forward, even if filming is a bit experimental. It worked well for the short time it lasts. The photography was the main subject here. It was like a series of really beautiful composed shots (actually in many of them was no movement, except for the camera panning) that made watching it very enjoyable for me. The action scenes were very well done too, and there's a lot of realistic gore, which gives balance to the long slow paced scenes. A few things I didn't like, was the singing parts, maybe too many or too long... one was enough... but I don't really mind them as much as to make me hate the movie, and there's a character developing reason for them to be there.

I was hyped for this, and I ended up disappointed.Only God Forgives ends up being a cluttered, perverse, bizarre-for-the-sake-of being-so letdown. I must say that the staring, minimalist theme that Ryan Gosling brings back (in reality, more so than in Drive) is tired & played out. It's time for him to come back to life. His dialogue here is equivalent to Arnold's in the first Terminator. He had, what, 20 lines of dialogue here? Enough already.The only true positive thing I took from this film is the style & cinematography. Absolutely STUNNING. I enjoyed it in Drive and I enjoyed it just as much here. Extremely atmospheric and sets the mood perfectly. It's everything else that makes this film a mess. It's one thing to be artsy, but at least have a coherent story with characters that you can care about. The end of the film seemed like a cop-out as well. The level of ambiguity here is exhausting. This type of approach worked in 'Drive' because you were given just enough of character development to actually care about what was happening on screen....not to mention understand what was going on. It's amazing how much Hollywood has abandoned this fundamental aspect of film making! As for the bizarre elements of the filmdisjointed and forced. Karaoke? Really?

Only God Forgives is Nicolas Winding Refn's newest film and is one of the most dramatic film events of the year. Some may be turned off and hate it for its simplicity. But may I remind you that was why Drive was so good. But if you are an art-house fan, you will absolutely enjoy it.A drug smuggler Jullian finds out his brother raped and killed a teenage prostitute and is murdered by a cop. His mother wants him to bring the cop to her so that they could kill him.The main reason I wanted to see this movie is because of Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling teaming up again. This combination is just as good as lobster and crab. Refn puts lots of heavy symbolism in many places. The title refers to characters in this movie. God is Chang, the cop. Crystal, the mother of Billy and Jullian is the devil.The music is one of the things I need to talk about. There are very few electronic music tracks in this film. Instead, the music is more focused on the orchestra. I think its suppose to fit the setting because it takes place in China. But I don't think the music is that good.I felt this film had some slow pacing. Unlike Drive which had a faster pace, this film felt like it went nowhere until the end.Direction by Refn is fantastic as his art-house style is not gone.

110,schroeder-gustavo,Just plain slow and boring,4,16 July 2015,"Only God Forgives was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, who directed Drive, which has become one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie takes some elements that made Drive so good, but takes them way too far. I'll just start by saying the cinematography in this movie is just phenomenal, every shot looks gorgeous, mainly because Refn really knows how to use lighting and camera angles to create a good looking movie.But the pacing in the movie is just off, which is one of my main complaints about it. I rarely say this about a movie, but honestly I thought it was very boring. I wanted it to be over, quickly. Also, there are basically no characters in the movie, as the people that are in it are more metaphorical than anything. I get some of the metaphors, but the ideas in the movie just aren't clear enough to be interpreted to make a good movie.I always appreciate when someone tries to create art, and since this is an art film, I do appreciate the effort, but Only God Forgives is only beautiful to the eyes, and it's sadly a disappointing film by Refn that is more boring than entertaining.",Only God Forgives
111,Condemned-Soul,An exercise in style over substance that excels so well in visuals and sound that it's easy to forgive its drawbacks,7,18 August 2021,"Nicolas Winding Refn is very meticulous at the framing and length of each shot. It's slow, bordering on laborious at times, yet also strangely captivating. The cinematography is excellent throughout. Early on the film is flooded with garish reds: symbolic of passion, anger, danger, and death (all evident from the outset) while there's a grace to each shot - slow moving but deliberate - and it works to ensnare us into the setting.The story is paper thin, but there's surprisingly more going on in the characterisation than some might give it credit for. Ryan Gosling bottles up his emotions, Kristin Scott Thomas has no filter, and Vithaya Pansringarm is calm and remorseless in equal measure - and the source of most of the film's graphic violence that's destined to test some viewers' limits.Overall, it's easy to see why some might not have the patience for this, but also understandable why some find it another treat from Refn. The score from Cliff Martinez is outstanding in its variation, synced perfectly to the imagery on screen, while the characters are just interesting enough to keep you engaged within its moody, shallow, revenge-fuelled storyline.7/10.",Only God Forgives

I finally got to see if with a group of friends the day it opened, and let me tell you...I loved it. It's a surreal and beautiful film. The violence, in my opinion, had a purpose, but many would disagree. I just don't see how critics who enjoy art house films would dislike this. Perhaps it's because of the foreign film feeling it gives? I'm not quite sure. I find it hard to decide whether I prefer this or Drive. Both are amazing but very different. I really don't understand the hate this is getting, and I'm sure some may think i'm crazy for enjoying it this much, but perhaps they were expecting something different? It's a film that you really need to see to make your decision. I could understand not liking the film because it's not your style or a little too slow, but the people giving it a 1 out of 10 and saying it's the worst film ever are absolutely insane. I give Only God Forgives a 9 out of 10. Favorite film of the year, beating out The Place Beyond The Pines.",Only God Forgives
113,vasco_cid,"Only Gof Forgives, only Refn understands",5,15 February 2017,"Refn is an auteur, there is no way around it. Every film he's done, from the more commercial and approachable Drive to the downright weird and dissident Neon Demon, Refn has his own personal visual trademark, edited and scored to a clinical degree that sets his filmography apart. Only God Forgives may just be, until now, his strangest and subjective film of all, veering away from every stereotypical Hollywood trademark and only a representation of Refn's creativity. Maybe because the film is so strange and subjective that is why it is certainly difficult to secure a definitive opinion on the first viewing. The plot, or simplicity thereof, is not the factor that will welcome debate, praise or dismissal, but rather Refn's unique visual approach.Bearing in mind how head over heels I fell for both Drive and Demon, the biased preconceptions I went into this one may have hurt my discernment of it - and because of that, I had a problem ascertaining whether or not I embarked or even liked this bizarreness. I knew I was watching something that I was not grasping and delving into. What was worse was that I didn't feel the need to come back to it to assess whether or not my experience of the film was final or if I should revisit it.",Only God Forgives
114,FilmMuscle,Violent Erotica,5,1 August 2013,"Phew, it's really a breath of fresh air to finally witness a unique, artistic film during the summer, which is clouded with an abundant amount of familiar blockbusters. Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives casts you into an incredibly uncomfortable and grotesque setting that's infested by criminals and scumbags. Ryan Gosling plays a drug smuggler (by the name of Julian) who's doing beyond-fair business in Bangkok but is keeping his criminal activities hidden by managing a Thai boxing club. When his older brother is killed for raping and murdering a 16-year-old girl, Julian is forced into a perilous conflict all while his mother visits to exact her revenge. The film's plot isn't really that complicated. In fact, it's fairly simple, but the film takes issue with this as it's apparent that Only God Forgives is greatly drawn-out to provide a lengthier feature film. The movie uses dialogue very sparsely, and the main character actually only utters 22 lines throughout the entire story. No, what you get in between moderate advancements in the story are long, pointless scenes displaying emotionless faces and ominous sceneries. This is where the pretentiousness comes in, and the very few fans of the film begin arguing about the true meaning of these unnecessary scenes, attempting to convince the rest of the world that it's all directly related to the main theme of the movie and an address to Ryan Gosling's character. A filmmaker can't just place his well thought-out ideas into a film and transform them into highly ambiguous scenes because the coherence and understandability of a film is key. The audience has to see what you see and think what you think. Unfortunately, you can, by all means, browse a forum and view the various theories enthusiastic fans of the movie possess, but as you're watching it, it can seem terribly messy as in ""what the hell am I watching?"" Eventually, after numerous jumps to different characters blankly starring at something, you get a scene of dialogue or another form of plot progression (some interesting action scenes). In a sense, the film does a poor job of properly communicating to its audience and making them feel anything besides disgust. The majority of the characters show no emotion whatsoever, especially Ryan Gosling as he looks on with his ""tough guy"" persona and robotic personality (this is by no means an insult to Ryan Gosling as he's proved, time and time again, that he's a largely talented actor but an insult to the character alone). Kristin Scott Thomas might've been the only one to deliver a believable and humane performance, and that could've well been the point but then have some other aspect replace the acting to keep the people entertained because, remember, after all that artistic value and metaphorical language, a film has to be entertaining at the end of the day. No one's going to finish a book that's wholeheartedly dull or a TV show that frankly has nothing to offer besides inner meaning. The interior is there, but the exterior isn't? No, both have to work decently for the art form to shape up to be a worthwhile experience. Now, one might think the film is simply horrible after reading all this text, but Only God Forgives surprisingly has a few redeeming qualities such as its unbelievably intriguing and breathtaking cinematography. The film's camera-work is wholly impressive, and there are countless shots in the film that make you watch in wonder. The many colors just pop out at you, and it only takes one to see the poster for the movie to understand just how engaging the visuals are. In a way, it shows the sensual or more erotic side of the film, interestingly conveying the amount of violent fantasies throughout. Speaking of, Only God Forgives is insanely brutal and vicious with its violence as limbs are cut off or cut into (a number of them occur off-screen). It establishes a pornographic vibe in the realm of violence and torture, so to speak. Anyways, the cinematography is amazing; the simplest way to put it. On top of that, the music- a fair part of it being electronic- compliments the film as well, again immersing you into this dark, painful atmosphere. Furthermore, Only God Forgives is one of those fascinating art films that you won't visually forget anytime soon, but its plot and characters leave much to be desired. This might be an independent movie created for sheer artistic value, but it's sadly another example of ""style over substance."" In the end, this isn't a must-see, but if you're a movie buff who's interested in how true cinema is crafted, then this might just be your style of film.",Only God Forgives

116,paulijcalderon,"A good mood-piece, but the story lost me",7,16 February 2017,"I thought ""Drive"" was excellent. I had problems with ""Neon Demon"", even though I liked the visuals and colors. I have mixed feelings about this one.The cinematography and look of the entire thing is fantastic. The world that the movie creates feels like something from a dream. And I know it's Thailand, but the way its portrayed makes it look like a fantasy version of it. There's something very unreal about the setting. All of that together with the look and the tone is phenomenal. It was just the story didn't do much for me. The fight scene was my favorite part. The buildup and execution of that scene worked well. It was exciting, but the rest of the movie was hard to get into I thought. I wasn't sure how grounded it was supposed to be, because it felt like it was both surreal and realistic. The two tones weren't balanced well for me to buy what was going on. People behaved in odd ways and I had trouble caring for them as well. It's a visual and dream-like film that I think is trying to say a lot. Something about the relation between gods and humans. The main character is sometimes like-able, but he has moments when he snaps and does something very questionable or unpredictable. Sometimes you can feel bad for him and sometimes you don't.It's not terrible, but I didn't think it was fantastic either. I wanted to like it more, but I couldn't get invested in the characters and the story lost me at many places. It works great as a mood-piece because the colors, sets, cinematography and music are all still worth taking a look at. We'll see if it grows on me over the years.",Only God Forgives
117,jburtonprod-802-759029,The Heaviest Handed Director in the History of Film,3,22 May 2018,"I've seen two movies from this guy. The other was the 'I'm going to beat you over the head with my metaphors' exercise in overindulgence called 'The Neon Demon' and this thing. I want you to understand I'm a major supporter of 'auteur' cinema. I love the Cohen bros, David Lynch (sometimes) and worship Stanley Kubrick. I really wanted to like Nicholas Refn but I find myself despising him. When I was in college one of my teachers used to say, 'Leave the last 15 brush strokes off of your paintings, It allows the viewer to fill them in'. Well, Mr. Refn not only puts in the last 15 strokes, he adds about 150 more. It makes for a film that you can look at but you have no invitation to participate in. You can almost hear him shouting instructions to the actors for how they should walk. see him posing them just perfectly for the camera and giving them EXACT line readings. Yes, there are some beautiful scenes in the movie and yes the art direction and cinematography are great but the whole exercise draws so much attention to itself that you can't involve yourself in what's going on. You can only look at it. I usually give a movie 10 to 15 minutes to draw me in. I've now watched two complete movies by Refn AND NOT BEEN DRAWN IN FOR A SECOND. He may one day turn into a good director if he lightens his touch. He might even become a great one but I can't see it. If you can sit through editing either of these two films and not see they are stillborn you've got no artistic eye and probably no creative soul. I'm not falling for it, again. Last movie of his for me. There no way to critique the acting because the actors aren't allowed to do anything. He may as well have put on a puppet show. And the writing gets buried under 'THE STYLE' so, you really can't evaluate that either. Even if you like art house movies, ( I do) I can't recommend this. It is totally lifeless and ultimately unenjoyable.",Only God Forgives
118,boydwalters,Decent atmospheric film ... Certainly not that bad !!!!,6,23 July 2013,"I don't see why so many people really hate this film ... Its certainly got atmosphere, though the director has gone a little bit too far :)) Ryan Gosling looks like he did a bump of k before each take :)) Who can blame Kristin Scott Thomas for taking the opportunity to play the most hideous hag from hell that she will ever play :)) ... I honestly wouldn't have recognised her Its dedicated to Jodorowsky but is not trying to mimic his films ... But is very surreal at times, though not in the art school juvenile way of David Lynch ... He's certainly more grounded than him and not half as annoying ... Though some of the karaoke shots certainly reminded me of him Its beautifully shot but of course there is no excuse not to be now that we have hi def video All in all, watchable but no masterpiece ... It could be better or worse on a second viewing... Its one of those movies Give it a go if you are able to immerse yourself in a film makers alternative universe",Only God Forgives
119,themissingpatient,Like a Samurai movie that lacks sword play,5,20 July 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn re-teams with Ryan Gosling for Only God Forgives, another revenge-fueled action/thriller shot and edited like an art film.Billy and Julian are American drug-smuggling brothers operating a Thai boxing club in Bangkok. When Billy rapes and murders a 15-year old prostitute, Chang is summoned. Working with the police, Chang brings in the father of the victim and allows him to have his revenge on Billy. The victim's father goes on to murder Billy. When Billy's grieving mother arrives in Bangkok, she not only demands Julian take revenge on his brother's murderer, but also does everything in her power to raise hell.Sounds like an action-packed thriller, doesn't it? While the film delivers much gore there is very little action. Fans of the genre will find themselves disappointed to the point of boredom and deem it a pretentious art film. The majority of art film lovers will be turned off by the gore. This leaves a very limited audience that may enjoy the film for what it is. A homage to Samurai movies that lacks sword play yet is saturated in blood, spiritual metaphors and references to greater films.Nicolas Winding Refn's last film wasn't much different. Drive had Ryan Gosling playing a violent psychopathic stunt driver who murders anyone and everyone who he feels is a threat to the mother and child living next door to him, who he has grown to care for. It was an over-rated, poorly paced film that relied heavily on references to classics such as Wild At Heart and True Romance without ever coming close to what made those stories so great. It also seemed to try to justify, if not glorify, the extremely violent ways in which he committed the murders, sending mixed messages.Only God Forgives is only slightly better. There are actually quite a few aspects that save the film from being a complete disaster. The mysterious character Chang, played by Vithaya Pansringarm, is hard not to be mesmerized by. The questions surrounding this character will linger long after the film is finished. Was he a villain? Though he was violent and became a great threat to our protagonist, he brought balance to the chaotic mess of the story. It is left up to us to decide whether he was the devil, a god or an angel of vengeance. The true antagonist of the story is the mother, played by Kristin Scott Thomas in her most powerful performance to date. Simply by introducing us to her, it is understood why both Billy and Julian took the paths in life that they did. The cinematography and soundtrack are also perfect for the dark story.This is far from a straight-forward revenge thriller and doesn't come close to being anywhere as effective and intense as Kim Jee-Woon's I Saw The Devil, Chan-wook Park's Oldboy or Gaspar Noé's Irreversible. Nicolas Winding Refn did dedicated Only God Forgives to Alejandro Jodorowsky, which if you are familiar with that filmmaker's work, this film will make that much more sense to you. There are also flavors of David Lynch, Takashi Miike, Gaspar Noé and even some Tarantino through-out, making the film quite a mixed bag. It seems Nicolas Winding Refn still has not found a voice of his own and his films will continue to suffer, unable to find their audience, because of this.For more sincere, unapologetic and brutally honest film reviews: http://meanmovies.tumblr.com",Only God Forgives
120,Hawkensian,"This is a film that concentrates far too heavily on obscurist, insubstantial metaphor rather than characters, dialogue and narrative,",3,12 October 2013,"In contrast with 'Drive', Refn and Gosling's last collaboration, 'Only God Forgives' is very much an art film, a film that's sheer metaphor. They're completely different.The film focuses on Julian (Ryan Gosling), an American drug dealer operating in Thailand who is laconic in the extreme (he speaks just 22 lines according to the IMDb trivia section.) When his sordid brother Billy (Tom Burke) is killed by the father of the girl Billy has murdered, Julian's mother Crystal (Kristen Scott Thomas) arrives in Bangkok seeking revenge. Her wrath brings her, Julian and their associates into the path of Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), an ex-cop who displays God-like abilities.The characters are incredibly bland, as are their relationships and indeed the film itself. Its attempts at depth comprise blatant oedipal elements that are both unoriginal and uninteresting. However seeing Kristin Scott Thomson remark about Gosling's inferior penis size at the dinner table is quite amusing.The behaviour of the characters made me cringe; watching Julian and particularly Chang robotically saunter along while sporting their best moody poses became plain embarrassing after a while. Whenever a character strung a few sentences together I breathed a sigh of relief; although no line in Refn's script is of any value, it was a welcomed development every time the suffocatingly absurd lack of dialogue was broken.What's even duller are its themes of religion and redemption. The irritating Chang is apparently the omnipotent moral arbiter of Bangkok, apparently he is 'God', whatever that means. I just thought he was a portentous prat.Then there is the problem of the film's violence. The violence in 'Drive' was explosive and shocking, it gave the film energy; it informed you of both the sheer danger of the situation and The Driver's disconcerting readiness for extreme retaliation. In 'Only God Forgives' however, Refn's violence is protracted, gratuitous and, like other areas of the film, ultimately embarrassing. Refn has admitted that he is a 'pornographer', and the film's main moment of violence, a lengthy and vicious torture scene, is certainly testament to that.'Only God Forgives' tries to be profound, however it doesn't really mean anything. There is nothing real about it, it simply doesn't resonate; the only modicum of empathy I began to experience during the film was for Julian and his complicated, broken relationships with women.Apart from making you feel uncomfortable for all the wrong reasons, the film just does not affect. This is because the film is sheer metaphor. Symbolism and ambiguity can be very interesting and powerful, but this is usually when it is combined with good acting, strong narrative and credible, interesting characters. Unfortunately, 'Only God Forgives' lacks all of this.40%www.hawkensian.com",Only God Forgives

The feelings I got from this had me running away from pure boredom and it's apparent lack of meaning.Maybe if it had some kind of hook, or otherwise was compelling enough to get into, but it just wasn't. The overbearing music reminded me a bit of ""There Will Be Blood"". Maybe that was the style they were shooting for (but never came close)?. Is it to much to ask for story, some kind of meaning, or entertainment to a movie? It reminds me of one those Fish tank screen savers; I guess one is supposed to just sit and watch things while they are going on.Horrible, waste of talent, waste of everything, most of all a waste of time.

It seems to be trying to be arty and stylish, but despite looking superb, there is zero substance. There are no real questions being asked, no real characters being developed, and a threadbare story. All that means is this is a film of art for art's sake, which was always the refuge of the uninspired.Ryan Gosling sucked. He just stands around, saying virtually nothing, no expression, no emotion, nothing. It was bizarre. Maybe that's how it was supposed to be, but all that means is that you have a dull, lifeless movie.Kristin Scott Thomas sucked. Zero acting effort.The script is s**t too. Very little dialogue, which would be fine except that the end result is weird conversations with zero emotion, zero acting, and bizarre pauses where no one talks.And then there's some reasonably serious swearing, which when added to the s**t dialogue just sounds weird and odd.The best parts were the Bangkok night scenery. The lighting is great (lots of red light, purple etc), but it is simply a s**t film. This film deserves nothing but contempt for wasting my money and time.

126,The_moan_of_all_moans,Only God Forgives; Chang doesn't.,8,5 August 2013,"7 people walked out of this film; maybe more, as i was engrossed at times and may have missed them. There was collective huffing and rambling at the end. And one person shouted ""that was sh**"" as they walked out. And Why? Well I couldn't care. As far as i'm concerned it's their loss if they don't enjoy films that are somewhat different. Films that don't toe the line to judgmental critics. Films with directors - like Nicolas Winding Refn - who put their spin and talent on it rather than join the ever growing list of stale money makers. I think what may have ignited these viewers hatred towards the film is their unwillingness to see what's really going on in; the title is a massive clue, and my add on in the summary basically spells it out. There where laughs at the karaoke scenes, but in reality Karaoke is one of the most popular things in Asia and is very suitable. Again something that's different just brings out hate in some people. It's fine to not enjoy the film; it's certainly not to everyones taste, but to say the story is awful is wrong. There are underlying, disturbing issues between Julian (Gosling) and Crystal(Thomas). There is not a great deal of dialogue, but the visuals more than make up for it. It's a film that shows you, you don't need words to describe what's going on. What's the popular phrase? ""actions speak louder than words"". That applies in this case. I couldn't point out a flaw in the acting. Refn directs his cast accordingly.For me it's a great film and i enjoyed it. It was something fresh. By the reaction so far it would be safe to say you're either going to love it or hate it.

127,SimonD1900,Review based on other reviews,8,14 January 2020,"Yes, I read some other reviews of this movie. A lot of people are comparing this movie to Drive. Like how it's nothing like Drive, don't expect Drive whatever you do or it's a little bit like Drive and off course this movie is so bad beacuse it's not Drive.Yes, it's the same director as in Drive. Yes, he's working together with Ryan Gosling again. When did they say they're making Drive 2?
This is an whole other movie. Wouldn't it been kind of bad if they went ""hey, Drive was pretty good and successful, let's make that again.""
Seriously, why are people so stupid? I mean review the movie for what it is. I'm not saying you have to like it. But to base a review on comparing this movie to another, just beacuse it's the same director and actor? What?Anyway, my personal review: This movie has some flaws. But it's a mesmerizing expirence with beautiful cinematography and a fantastic sound. This heavy deep score really makes the movie feel more deep, probably deeper then it is, but I like it! Same technique was used in both Blade Runner movies, worked well there also.The message of this artsy weird movie? It's kind of surrealistic and abstract, so it's up to anyone's assumption, a thing I think is great in any art.Personally, I think it's about men's evil nature, the simple tale that in every man there is good and bad. We don't really know why we have these strong emotions and urges in us, a thing that makes them even more dangoures. But we're capable to both evil and good. It's in our nature, deep down, we can't escape it.It's also about a man in great great pain. Someone that had a hard upbringing which made him a troubled and emotionally disabled man. That led him to a life where he did evil. But he is seeking redemption deep down in his soul, to do what was made wrong, right. But he doesn't know how. It's just a feeling that is haunting him.It also has a religious theme. With the portrayal of the punishing vengeful angry God. Where Vithaya Pansingarm is good. And Kristin Scott Adams is the devil.And that it's set in Bangkok fits very well, since it's known as the city of sin, at least had that reputation before. And the name of the movie is almost genius, or it is!Flaws; I think, that at times it's a bit too ambiguous and slow, which makes it drag to much and just loose its point and become boring at times. But at the same time, I think the whole movie is masterfully done for what it is and could probably not have been done better. No actually, it couldn't. It's perfect.Not for everyone off course. But a damn good movie.",Only God Forgives
128,s_campanale,Bangkok Impenetrable - Refn and Gosling Mann-up for surreal drama where style over substance is the Lynch-pin,7,15 September 2013,"We saw this at our local multiplex on a one night showing on the way back from its West end run, hence the late review.""Only God Forgives"" follows its controversial predecessor ""Drive"" in deliberately adopting a 1980s style, modelling itself on the dour urban noirs of Michael Mann, Paul Schrader and the like. The ""story"", as with the formers, is a Calvinist tale of guilt and the desire for both revenge and atonement set into a cookie cutter underworld noir story. An American drug boss rapes and kills a young prostitute during a fit. Otherworldly Thai police officer, Chang, a combination of an Archangel, Dirty Harry, Ghost Rider and the Punisher, allows the girl's father to kill him then chops his arm off for his own sins. His brother Julius is meant to take revenge, but doesn't because he believes he deserved his fate. Enter their mother, slutty ""Dragon Lady"" crime boss Crystal – with whom both boys had an incestuous affair and whose husband apparently died at Julius's hands-demanding retribution. As Julius dithers like a latter day Hamlet, bodies on both sides pile up and Chang dispenses his un-flexing brand of divine justice courtesy of his sword.Like the précis of a Malick picture, it sounds pretty conventional on paper, but the result is anything but. Adopting the Mann approach of ""Style over narrative"" the film consists largely of long silences, stares into the distance, and oh so very very beautiful set design, colour co-ordinated thematically in reds, yellows, blacks and blues all to the tune of Cliff Martinez's Glass-y score .So far so ""Drive"", but this time Refn wants to outdo himself and borrows from David Lynch and Alejandro Jodowrosky (to whom he dedicates the picture) in blending the real with the dream/nightmare world so that we no longer know if what we are seeing happened or not. The result is a film which ceases to operate on even the most basic level of logic or rational structure and instead becomes a disturbing surrealist trip, with moments of lucidity that make an unprepared audience wonder where the rest of the ""plot"" is?The film features some extremely brutal violence; most of it at the hands of Chang and his Thai sword, including a protracted ""Hostel"" style torture sequence using fruit knives that had a few people walk out at our showing. Following each moment of carnage is a sequence of Chang singing old Thai love songs in an empty Karaoke bar watched on by his utterly impassive colleagues, a very Lynch-ian touch to be sure.It is hard to rate the acting in such a movie, where what is required is not naturalness or spontaneity but the direct opposite. Ryan Gosling (Julius) proves yet again that being a Zombie is no impediment to a Hollywood A-list career with a ""performance"" of utter passivity and immobility. As Chang, Thai actor Vithaya Pansringam is equally impassive, but carries off the presence and menace of a divine agent of justice despite being quite a scrawny middle aged bald guy. Kristen Scott-Thomas, for 2 decades the epitome of Galois puffing Anglo-French chic and style here plays against type as a slutty American ""Dragon Lady"", being barely recognisable beneath fright wig and make up. She has fun with the role, but she's never allowed to develop as fully as we'd like. Beautiful Yayaying Rhatha Phongam is also fine as the local prostitute that Julius is sort of seeing, but apart from a tense dinner with Crystal is reduced more to an image and an idea in Julius's mind. Gordon Brown is also good as the Scottish enforcer for the clan, though his character simply disappears towards the end without explanation.Refn's latest film is one of those works that cannot be judged as a conventional cinematic work, even though it wears the outer garments of one, but instead falls into the category of ""tone poem"" cinema, where images, music and atmosphere convey power and meaning instead of the usual tools of narrative, dialogue and dramatic action. Well known masters of this genre have included Cocteau. Fellini, Kubrick, Lynch, Malick and Aronofsky, whose works continue to divide and frustrate audiences, many of whom walk out enraged shouting ""What? I didn't understand a single damn thing about that!"" It is more akin to ballet or painting than modern cinematic tradition, and transcends most conventional notions of ""plot"" or ""drama"".I guess, like some cinematic Rorsarch drawing, everybody will see into this what they will, whether it is masterpiece or pretentious crap, disturbing nightmare, beautiful but empty extended Chanel No5 advert, searing glance into the human soul or waste of time. Just don't expect a conventional, even semi-conventional film.",Only God Forgives

He was supposed to be empty and melancholy and conveyed that brilliantly. Kristin Scott Thomas looked amazing! I did not recognize her. She looked 20 years younger than when she starred in the English Patient.I guess this film is a little more abstract than most. Wasn't sure how to rate it. I didn't understand the significance of the detective singing karaoke to a room full of police officers.

Perhaps this says something for the lack of truly awful films the person has actually seen, but if you are familiar with the reference to the Lynch directed masterpiece, or in fact David Lynch at all, you are already most of the way towards knowing whether you can sit through the hour and a half that is 'Only God Forgives'.Nicolas Winding Refn's second collaboration with Ryan Gosling was not going to be a Gosling film at all; it was only due to the dropping out of a fairly unknown British actor, for a role in 'The Hobbit', and Gosling's desire to help his best buddy director, that lead to where we are now. Where are we? We have an art house film that was hated at the Cannes Film Festival, and which would have most likely bypassed most casual cinema goers had it not been for the big name, actually drawing in crowds of excited but naive Gosling fans, and curious but naive passers-by, on a trip out for their weekend's entertainment. Sadly for them, 'The Notebook' this is not.Remove 'Drive' from Refn's catalogue and 'Only God Forgives' sits as a steady continuation of his vision; 'Drive' is in fact the most accessible and ""Hollywood"" the man has ever gone, or may likely ever go. Sadly for many who do not know of the 'Pusher' trilogy, 'Bronson', 'Fear X' or 'Valhala Rising', it makes for high expectations ripe for the shattering! Forget any comparison with 'Drive'; the film features Gosling, who again says very little, features explosions of violence and looks absolutely gorgeous. That is about all the two films have in common. The story, as far as it is one, is of Julian, who runs a muay thai boxing club as a cover for more shady dealings. His older brother does something awful and vengeance is visited upon him; this prompts the devil of the piece, Julian's poisonous mother, played by Kristen Scott Thomas as you have never seen, to fly in and order Julian avenge his brother's demise. Julian cannot do this, and so follows the tripped out dream-scape that seems to be a vague effort at a revenge tale, a spiritual journey which serves as an exploration of the futility of vengeance, the battle between forces of good and evil, the damage of guilt, self-loathing, the need for forgiveness and redemption, the Oedipal complex of a man broken and owned by his mother, and shattered masculinity, all delivered with shadows of Shakespeare in the background.The top of the list of great things about this film is the cinematography; you can DESPISE this, and still need to concede that we are unlikely to see a film whose framing, lighting and textures are more terribly seductive. Larry Smith shot 'Eyes Wide Shut' with Stanley Kubrick, and has worked with Refn twice previously; based on the evidence, it is fair to say Refn has found his partner, just as Chris Nolan had with Wally Pfister. Next up, the sound editing and Cliff Martinez's score rumble, grind and push at the edges of the piece. Martinez previously worked with Refn on 'Drive', but again, there is little comparison. The performances are all very good, but it should be noted, and this is meant absolutely sincerely, it could be easy to watch this with the wrong mindset. These people are not characters, they are archetypes; do not expect standard characterisation. Now, the violence! For all the uproar about how full-on this movie is, it is quite clear this criticism comes from people whose high water mark for extremity is 'Saw'. I should note, this is not a complaint; in fact, I rather admire the technique of always cutting away, or shooting the violent scenes in such a way that we, the audience, aren't completely privy to the retribution. Even if a belief that this ties in with a theme of the film is incorrect, it is still safe to assume that it was Refn's intention to defy our expectation of what we are going to see every time. This does, however, lead me to say that the violence is tame. Yes, it is extremely stylish, but I have seen more raw and disturbing violence in Scorsese's pictures than in this one.In many areas admirable for its Kubrick-standard perfection, but admittedly tiring, this is a film that will find its most loyal audience in the art house crowd. If you only watch films for a standard western approach, an entertaining story, with a clear through-line and plot, characters with traditional arcs and actors giving dialogue-driven performances, then avoid at ALL costs! If you grasp the idea that a film can be something else, an expression like a Salvador Dali painting, in which every image, gesture and moment can be considered key to your understanding of what's going on, deepening your analysis of the film, then this is worth your attention, as it does have a lot going on that cannot be absorbed in one sitting. That does not mean you will love it; despite a dedication to Alejandro Jodorowsky , Refn lacks the man's mastery of this sort of visual poetry. You will, however, be hard pushed to find a more strange and challenging film in the main stream for some time! Overall, this is not a scratch on Refn's best work, but it is worth giving him, and all involved, a round of applause for truly going all out to shake us out of what I will call ""cinematic apathy"". Now and then we need a film like this, whether we like it or not!",Only God Forgives
131,sohansurag,"Of Sex, Emasculation and Revenge!",5,24 December 2013,"Of Sex, Emasculation and Revenge! If you are familiar with Nicholas Winding Refn's works you might feel that you'd feel right at home with Only God Forgives. Being a fan of Drive, I sat down with the same presumption that I'd end up at least liking, if not loving, Only God Forgives. But after watching I was perplexed and found myself winding up on IMDb forums searching for answers very much like the protagonist of Only God Forgives. Believe me this ain't a scathing review of Only God Forgives, I immensely wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't do so. Even after wandering in the IMDb forums learning new insights about the movie, its religious undertones and all just didn't make this a better movie for me. It was enlightening for me, learning all those I'd failed to notice the first time but I don't think I'd be able to sit through this a second time. There are people out there who is touting the movie to be ingenious but I just couldn't buy it. I do agree that its one of the most visually arresting movies ever made, having striking resemblances with Gasper Noe's Enter The Void or Cronenberg movies. Each scene in Only God Forgives is drenched in incredible visual artistry, with a never-before-seen neon and lights play, thanks to Larry Smith's cinematography. I am still saturated with the visuals of the movie, though not much with its plot or performances.Ryan Gosling as the protagonist of the movie, Julian, felt like an extension of his character from Drive and had nothing novel to offer. Of course he's a mentally disturbed persona but its hard to look past a character who simply stares at things or barely says five lines throughout the movie. His silence does say a lot, about his past and the relationship with his mother is further fleshed out when Kristin Scott Thomas is introduced. Where Ryan's performance felt bland, Kristin's was way too aggressive, way too show-offy but she still managed to bring out the anger, the frustration and some motherly (or maybe a more incestuous) elements on the table. Doned in a black and white attire, Vithaya Pansringarm plays Chang, the main antagonist of the movie. He is a crooked cop and allegedly a self proclaimed GOD who walks around serving his own brand of justice wherever he saw it fit, punishing his victims with his blade or granting them redemption by chopping their hands off. Yayaying Rhatha Phongam plays Mai. Her role never said anything actually and all she did was masturbate in front of Julian and despite him taking her out for a date, his feelings for her felt more monochrome. No character in this movie felt even remotely good, everybody had shades of yang. The concepts of God, The Devil and Redemption made an otherwise simple revenge-plot convoluted and slow.If there is one thing that I can cling on to, despite however crappy the movie, is its score. Cliff Martinez's score is not as magical as that of Drive's but it does most of the heavy lifting here. If not for the score, the scenes of the movie would have felt a lot more slower. I'd absolutely adored Drive's soundtrack and score, the same couldn't be said here as I can't even quote one single memorable track. It did immerse me in an otherwise insipid pace but thats about it.As previously quoted, Only God Forgives exudes copious amounts of violence and sexuality though the violence is gratuitous the sex, mostly, is implied. It also promises abundant ambiguity but Nicholas Winding Refn, in a recent interview mentioned what he meant with the plot and its characters, leaving no space for our imaginations. Had he to be ambiguous, couldn't he have gone the Christopher Nolan way? Not telling us anything? Not even nodding what all the audiences have racked up their brains to?While Drive and Valhalla Rising was accessible to a large group of audiences Only God Forgives require an excessive eye for details, a lot of time post-watching the movie and above all a forgiving attitude for its flaws and slow pace. Watch it for the visuals and the way its artistically taken, thats all that you can ever root for in Only God Forgives. As much as I want to love this movie, I am forced to give it a thumbs down.",Only God Forgives

136,Corpus_Vile,Only God Drives Brooding I mean Only God Forgives,8,30 August 2013,"A film by Nicholas Winding Refn Starring Ryan Gosling as Moody, Broody Soulful Antihero Kristin Scott Thomas as Moody Antihero's Ice Cold but Milfy Ma Vitaya Pansingram as The Thai Terminator And introducing: Lots of Thai ladies in 1950s Suzie Homemaker dresses, as the supporting cast.Thailand. The present day. Ryan Gosling is moody, broody, laconic soulful drug dealer and Muay Thai kick boxing gym owner, Julian. His life consists of dealing drugs, not saying much and staring at nothing in visually stunning surroundings, to an 80s tinged quasi retro synthesizer score, when he's not having digitally probing hand sex with a Thai hooker called Mai. One day Julian's rather addled brother is killed for doing something really really (REALLY) bad. When Julian hears the news he stares and then stares some more, in even more visually pleasing cinematography, as being a drug dealer is hard and requires much intense soulful reflection. Things aren't helped when Julian's ice cold and rather milfy Ma appears on the scene. Julian's Ma is exactly like Vera Farmiga in Bates Motel, only far more vicious and abrasive and she has no time at all for Julian's brooding. She viciously belittles him at dinner, in front of his hooker bird Mai and then bizarrely, starts talking about her dead son's wang in a disturbingly graphic manner, even using a word which rhymes with mock. Bottom line- she wants revenge and when an ice cold milf is looking for revenge and she's yer Ma no less, well......Julian broods. And stares, while that awesome soundtrack plays. And... not much happens for quite some time... However, it turns out that Julian's (thoroughly despicable) brother was killed only with the permission of a certain cop. This cop is The Thai Terminator and he's indescribably bad ass. He's so bad ass that his day typically consists of walking in slow mo while waving a short but very lethal looking sword about, in a highly stylized choreographed manner, while another 80s retro synthesizer score throbs in the background. It's almost like the Thai Terminator is really God ,(albeit a relentlessly homicidal and incredibly badass Old Testament blood and vengeance kinda God as opposed to his metro son who appeared in the sequel, the New Testament), Julian's Mam is the Devil and they are battling over his redemption seeking and admittedly soulful soul... (It's also almost like Gosling's actual character, Julian is really the driver from Drive, who has hightailed it to Thailand, to get into a showdown with a Thai and far more bad ass version of Albert Brooks). The Thai Terminator is SO bad ass, that he thinks nothing of singing Karaoke- for AGES- after horribly and jaw-droppingly graphically, torture-murdering a thinks- he's -hard- but- really- isn't- compared- to -the- Thai-Terminator, not so hard ass Assie drug lord. (read that last sentence back again, slowly. It'll make more sense once you break it down:))Yes, the violence in Only God Forgives out-drives Drive in the sheer left field icky gooey in yer face violence stakes, but it's all so visually sumptuous, it becomes beautiful. In fact, EVERY damn scene in this film is beautiful. I actually wept and had a spontaneous and simultaneous climax when watching it, and the climax was purely due to Only God Forgives' sheer aesthetic beauty, and that's never happened to me when watching a non pornographic film before, but considering I've just given way TMI there, I'll simply move on gracefully and say see this film.It's so pretentious and self indulgent it makes both Antichrist and The Idiots combined seem really really non-pretentious but it's just so soul achingly beautiful, you really won't care. Its pretentiousness and self indulgence actually make it even more awesome. And by all rights I should hate this film, as I'm an admitted philistine in regards to art-house cinema and will be the first to confess that I normally have no time for this kinda arty farty claptrap, but man... this film rocked and had David Lynch had have directed it, it would have been cheered instead of booed at Cannes. I intend to revisit it again soon and hopefully weep (and um... y'know, ahem) again at its sheer ethereal beauty.A solid 7.5/10 rounded to 8 for IMDb, pretentious as hell (and I know a lot of people hate the use of the word ""pretentious"", and certainly not without justification either, but trust me folks, it really does apply here:)), but awesomely beautiful. And it also has Ryan Gosling having a bad ass fight while wearing a suit that undoubtedly cost more, than the non existent down payment I never put down on the apt I don't own... which is reason enough to see it. And anyone who Liked (as I did) Valhalla Riding should REALLY dig this one, as it has the same dreamy & surreal style/tone. Only even more badass.And joking aside folks, Vitaya Pansingram is actually excellent in the film and exudes a sheer commanding menacing presence, while not actually saying much, which is rather difficult to pull off successfully, but Pansingram not only manages to pull it off, he pretty much elevates the film in any scene he's in. To stand out in such a beautifully shot surreal film via your sheer presence is quite a feat and my hat's off to him.",Only God Forgives

His presence is so unnerving and tense that it made me think why aren't Bond baddies like this anymore.My only negative is Ryan Gosling. I'm yet to see him show any emotion in his last 3 films.

139,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Only God Forgives,6,1 August 2013,"Julian, a drug-smuggler thriving in Bangkok's criminal underworld, sees his life get complicated when his mother compels him to find and kill whoever is responsible for his brother's recent death. Chang, a Thai police lieutenant, is exacting his own brand of vigilante justice and punishing everybody involved.Only God Forgives is the classic case of a director doing a continuation of his authorial style. An aesthetic that was recognized in a previously successful film is further explored in a more extreme fashion in a follow-up piece. Very often it's focused on using the established cinematic style to carry the entire movie. Wong Kar Wai made Fallen Angels after the success of Chungking Express. David Lynch made Inland Empire after the success of Muholland Drive. Terrence Malick made To the Wonder after Tree of Life.Only God Forgives is Nicolas Winding Refn's stylistic continuation of Drive. What's stripped away is the frequent plot turns, traditional character development and character likability. These are probably the most quiet cinematic gangsters I've ever seen in my life. Characters are posed like empty vessels. They don't talk much. Sometimes when they do, the director mutes their dialogue. Ryan Gosling plays a still taciturn character in a similar way he did in Drive. Kristin Scott Thomas is an effective threatening presence as Julian's stern mother Crystal. There's very little to draw from Gosling's Julian, but it is there. Even within it's morally ambiguous world, there is a clear character arc. Julian is an active character trying to find redemption but also wants to please his mother. Which leads to me to the Chang characterNicolas Winding Refn has said the Lieutenant Chang character represents the Old Testament God, exacting judgment and punishment on all the sinners in the story. I am not sure how clear that is in the film unless the audience read the press notes beforehand. Does the God theme really matter? In a way, yes. The film is so stoic with its characters posed like figurines, you cannot help but inject symbolism into the film's empty canvas to derive meaning out of it. Trying to watch this film as a genre crime thriller, which is what it is on the surface, would be relatively more frustrating. Luckily I caught on to it.The Chang character, in a perpetual black shirt with a white collar, is dressed like a priest. He is a violent enforcer of poetic justice, and all his actions are ritual-like. In a more traditional movie, Chang would have been the protagonist. Here, he's the antagonist. From the story's perspective, where all the characters are varyingly degrees of bad, it's as if Chang is the Grim Reaper coming to collect souls even though he in fact is a force for good. That's a really interesting left-field story choice and I dug that. Lieutenant Chang is the most fascinating character and a great antagonist.There is an indulgent aspect to Only God Forgives, any director taking on big questions will naturally come off that way. Refn could have easily written a theology thesis but he's chosen to express his thoughts with narrative film. I have no problem with that but it automatically sets up qualifiers for audiences to enjoy the film. While it is not necessary, I think having viewed Drive first will help one familiarize with Refn's film language before seeing this movie. As for the God themes, it can go either which way. Some may find it pretentious, but I found images from the film stuck with me long after and I am still pondering the film's themes. I found the Julian and Chang characters compelling. So for that, Only God Forgives is neither the masterpiece nor disaster that all the Cannes hype is suggesting, but more of a hyper-stylized personal statement. It will surely divide audiences, and your enjoyment will depend on how you deal with abstractions.For more reviews, please visit and subscribe to my film blog - http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",Only God Forgives

141,DubhDoo,"""Time to meet the devil""",9,11 August 2013,"'Only God Forgives' is not the sequel to the brilliant 'Drive'. Yes, it may feature the same lead actor, composer and of course, director, but 'Only God Forgives' is really a world away from the aforementioned, forgoing the traditional narrative structure and likable leads that film had, in favour of something much more unconventional and polarising. It has more in common with some of Refn's weirder fare such as 'Fear X' and 'Valhalla Rising', and chances are that if you are a fan of his work then you'll like his latest film, but if you're going on strength of 'Drive' then you'll be disappointed.The film is set in Bangkok, where American expatriate Julian (Ryan Gosling) runs a Muay Thai boxing club with his brother Billy (Tom Burke) that acts as front for drug-dealing. However, when Billy rapes and kills a 16-year old girl, Lieutenant Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) – referred to as ""the Angel of Vengeance"" – allows the girl's father to brutally murder Billy. Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), Julian's over-bearing mother, arrives in Bangkok and demands that her only remaining son take care of the killer. Despite having no desire to do so, this puts Julian on a collision course with the seemingly supernatural police chief.Its storyline might make it sound like a tense revenge thriller, but the film is anything but. It moves at a slow and languorous pace, which adds to the nightmarish atmosphere that is so brilliantly created from the first frame. In this, the line between what is real and what is not is frequently blurred in a number of Lynchian dream (?) sequences where Julian sees the Angel of Vengeance. Larry Smith's sumptuous cinematography expertly conveys this hallucinatory feel, bathing the screen in primary colours and experimenting with lighting. A fantastic score by Cliff Martinez perfectly complements the neon-drenched visuals with its mixture of electronics and Thai instruments.Gosling may have been quiet in 'Drive', but compared to his turn as Julian, he was a motor mouth, as he utters only 17 lines in this film. Despite the role originally being intended for Luke Evans (who dropped out to work on Peter Jackson's 'Hobbit' trilogy), Gosling makes it his own, remaining an engaging figure whenever on screen, even if he tiptoes around self-parody. Filling out another near-silent role is Pansringarm as the Angel of Vengeance, who delivers a terrific performance and is a magnetic presence every time he enters the frame. The only other substantial role is Kristin Scott Thomas' as Crystal; electrifyingly playing against type, seen no better than in a dinner scene where she calls Julian's girlfriend/ favourite prostitute, Mai (Rhatha Phongam) ""a cum dumpster"" and cites penis envy as the reason why he hated his brother. However, she still has complete control over him – he lights her cigarettes and kisses her on the cheek when prompted.With 'Only God Forgives', Nicolas Winding Refn continues along his path of being one of the most interesting and singular filmmakers around today, delivering a film that is unlike anything else around today, evoking the work of Gaspar Noe and the great surrealist director Alejandro Jodorowksy (whom the film is dedicated to). Like the latter's work, this movie is filled with symbolic visual metaphors that leave the film open to interpretation but suffice to say there is definitely a religious aspect to it. ""Time to meet the devil"", Billy says at the beginning, a line which sets a tone for the remainder of film as Gosling's Julian embarks on a gripping descent into hell, all-the-while yearning for forgiveness for his sins. Unconventional and uncompromising, Refn and Gosling's second feature together is, understandably, not for everyone. But for this viewer, it's one of the most brutally violent, bizarre and pure brilliant films I've seen this year.",Only God Forgives
142,hazysistersunshine33,"I don't know if I would recommend this movie for everyone, but if you're into stylized kind of artsy thought provoking movies then check it out. You may appreciate it.",7,16 September 2014,"I remember the few people I know who saw this and the reviews I read weren't glowing. The main complaint is that it was just boring and kind of went no where and had no real point to it. I agree with them on this to a certain extent, but this movie kind of fascinated me for some reason. It's just one of the most atmospheric movies I've seen and the sets are effective. I wouldn't be surprise if they built the whole film around this boxing gym that Ryan Gossling and his older crazy brother own. The lighting in all scenes is masterfully done for full effect. There are several scenes that take place in this purplish light hall way that are actually pretty cool. The gym has this lighting all over and this oddly designed window/wall where a lot of scenes are filmed. In fact everything about the movie is purely calculated and masterful. The soundtrack also compliments the movie perfectly. I didn't think it was really boring. but I can see why other people would think that. It does run at a sluggish pace, punctuated by scenes of incredible violence. As I said Gossling and his brothers own a gym and are into some criminal activity to make money. The older brother is crazy and ends up just slaughtering a prostitute starting a war with the Bangkok cops. I don't know if this movie is accurate of how those cops act, but you don't mess with them. They don't care about following the law themselves. There is this one particular hard core higher ranking cop. I think he's a cop. He has no problem using violence and even torture to get the information he needs. There is a fight scene that takes place at the wacky looking gym between Gossling and the cop that is really slickly filmed. Gossling mother played superbly by Kristen Scott Thomas is a real character too. She's sexy and tough and you get the impression there was some incest going on there. I don't know if I would recommend this movie for everyone, but if you're into stylized kind of artsy thought provoking movies then check it out. You may appreciate it.",Only God Forgives

Julian's brother Billy (Tom Burke) has brutally stabbed a 16-year–old prostitute. A Thai policeman named Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) allows the father to exact revenge on Billy, and kill him. Chang cuts off the father's arm for letting his daughter become a prostitute. Julian's mother Crystal comes to Thailand demanding revenge for her son's death. Crystal is a drug dealer, and no stranger to violence. Suddenly the prostitute's father is killed, but who did it? Was it Julian, the Thai police, or did Crystal order the killing? Only God Forgives is an incomprehensible mess. I know Hollywood wants to attract the huge Asian market to watch its movies, but this is not the way to do it. It tries very hard to be an art-house movie, a great number of the scenes are bathed in, red or blue, scenes are shot in slow motion, many scenes are shot with no dialogue at all But as much as it tries to put style over substance, it returns to an old and tired formula, bloody mind numbing violence and soft-core pornography. The Thai women are all prostitutes and treated like the scum on the bottom of the filmmakers' shoes to be flicked off and discarded like so much refuse. The woman in general are treated with such heinous brutality that the writer of this movie should really look into getting some psychological help. As if that's not bad enough, an incestuous relationship is hinted at between Crystal and one or both of her sons. This is violence porn, wrapped in a revenge fantasy, with a heaping helping of Hollywood's favorite profession, prostitution, thrown in for bad measure. This movie gives in to the worst and basest instincts that people have, and for no other reason than to make a buck.Ryan Gosling whose quiet, distant, persona served him well in movies like Drive, and Blue Valentine might as well be starring in a silent movie here, he doesn't say a word for the first 25 minutes, and the movie is only 90 minutes long. When he does speak, he says inane things like ""Do you want to fight?"" to Chang, and ""I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend."" to a prostitute he's fixated on. He may not have done irreparable damage to his career, but it is damage nonetheless. Kristen Scott Thomas may have very well ended her career with this role, the woman in The English Patient, The Horse Whisperer and Gosford Park, plays a woman so vile and reprehensible that it's a performance that's impossible to watch without cringing.Nicolas Refn Winding wrote and directed this film he wrote and directed the infinitely better film Drive, but the wheels came off this film early and it mercifully slid to a stop in 90 long minutes. There is nothing even remotely watchable to this movie and I will think long and hard before I see another Nicolas Winding film.

Some say this movie is a work of art done in a Lynchian style. Others say this film is total nonsense. I simply say that it is a pretentious attempt to emulate the Lynchian style. The misunderstanding seems to be that anything remotely weird must be attributed to David Lynch. Weirdness, however, is not a value in itself. I could find that in a circus freak show or on a New York subway. True, Lynch's characters are odd, but they are not one or two dimensional. His movies are often an exploration of the extremes of good and evil. In order for good to look its best, it must be contrasted with pure evil, which explains some of Lynch's more violent characters. This is the main problem with 'Only God Forgives;. There is no redemption. The policeman, played by the deadpan Vithaya Pansringarm, is, I suppose, the closest we can get to a hero in this film. He metes out a peculiar form of sadistic justice, cutting off various body parts with the same expression that he maintains when he speaks to his daughter or sings karaoke. Also, Lynch's films, no matter how dark, are often touched with a certain twisted humor, there is no humor to be found here. If, however, you do find humor in this film, I would suggest speaking to a psychiatrist at once.I now should address the film's artistic merits. Basically, it uses a technique that I refer to as, 'fill in the blanks'. In this technique, common to artistic films, two characters simply stare at each other in silence. The point here is to make the viewer imagine what they may be thinking. I applauded the use of this technique in the film because it gave me time to go to the kitchen and make some popcorn. When I returned, the two characters were still staring at each other, possibly trying to remember what their next line was. Because this technique allowed me to get a lot of things done without missing anything in the film, I rated it higher than I would have.Much is made of Ryan Gosling choosing to be in this film. Why? He has always been willing to take a chance with films. I have no idea why he chose to be in this one, however. Maybe he lost a bet. In any event, he's not required to act, so he doesn't. He, in keeping with the other characters in the film, keeps the same frozen expression throughout. Besides, he only says about five words so, whatever they paid him, he made out pretty well. In truth, the role could have been played just as well by Chuck Norris, except that he would have shown a far greater emotional range. At least the poorly choreographed fight scene would have been more believable.I wouldn't watch this film again and would not recommend it to anyone. It was far too brutal for me and some of the torture scenes seemed far too gratuitous; brutality for brutality's sake. However, since you really don't care about anyone in the film, it really doesn't matter if they get tortured or not. Besides, by the end of the film, the only real victim of torture was me.",Only God Forgives
147,mrxelement,Dazzling Neon Greatness Nightmare,9,21 July 2013,"Seeing ""Only God Forgives"" in theaters is best cinematic experience to see this year with its down right awesome massive magnificent cinematography on the big screen that you wouldn't want to blink. Not only the beautiful clocking neon glow making it appeal to the eye but the way the director uses it in a rightful manner creating Thailand in its humble way at best sort of seems like illusions to the open mind. Surprisingly, some of the parts of the movie felt kinda scary at times sort of like a realistic nightmare of a hallway of hell using tons of red light and shadows to express the evil within. Now this movie is nowhere near as Drive standards but, ""Only God Gives"" manages to capture every single elegant detail making you beg for more and more to come. It's more of a Valhalla Rising 2.0 neon style. It's a different movie and I liked that.The violence in this movie was not even bad as the critics say. For this movie it was used in a right way of not overly exploiting it to much.On a final note, its a masterpiece of perfection Thank you Nicholas for giving me a film worth watching again and again.9.5/10",Only God Forgives
148,botrytis,"""You wanna Fight?"" well I don't, but I wanna defend this",9,21 August 2013,"This motion picture we got here can be considered as or horror, art, western, or psycho-thriller. Whichever we pick as a possible genre for this movie, it does darn good on that field.The Cinematography is brilliant, pure, it has no flaws, everything focuses on the details, the pictures are talking to us, no need for any other narrational help, the visuals do it themselves.The soundtrack/music /sound is pretty influential, even more then at any other movies, almost reaches the influential level of the visuals. Cliff Martinez' sense of illustrating the deepness of the pictures helps us set our mind into the right frequency to comprehend the happenings, and decoding the scripted visuals. The Direction/ing by Refn is inspiring, his individuality reminds us that not only Hollywood exists (which is pretty lucky situation today). I totally admire the guy, not because the majority of the audience 'criticising' his style, but because I totally understand him, his intentions and language. So yes, there are people who like his movies, and we can be happy for that since we appreciate the complicated, artsy, odd, not-pretty-easy products. And we will return to the 'audience' theme later***... The phasing is influenced by the importance of the visual, symbolism, psychedelistic story-telling, which is why seems slow, but understandable after re-watching it.The Acting is also influenced by the screenplay, with the actors modest and slow moves the storytelling's dreamy effect is maintained, and after re-watch we realize all the actors actions, and intentions are actually well directed, and crafted. On the otherhand, the dialog scenes show good quality of the actors, so no problem with the cast either.The Story has levels, there is the simple revenge-vendetta thing, and there is the other level, which connects the deepness of characters and their psyche to the happenings/story. It's complicated, because the language is not verbal, it's far beyond it, it's multi-dimensional, hence it's hard to talk normally, or shortly about it. One thing is sure, it's about psychedelism, and the consequence of these psyche-play by these different individuals which is told by massive symbolism, therefore it's not enough to see it once. Overall this film's oddness makes it a powerful ride to psychedelistic world, which gives us many new experiences with a story which may not be new for us, but it's intention to set it into different perspectives referred to any other Hollywood flick is admirable, and lovable. Plus it's darn atmospheric.*** I heard that it was booed at the Cannes Festival, which is pretty primitive behaviour from any audience.

154,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,A pretentious let down.,4,29 January 2014,"Only God Forgives was one of my most anticipated films of 2013. I was such a huge fan of Nicolas Winding Refn's previous film Drive, which also starred Ryan Gosling, that I couldn't wait to see what he had in store next. The news for Only God Forgives was certainly not flowing. In fact, an official trailer for the film was released just a month before its release. I wasn't disappointed in the trailer. It looked like a slick film and the trailer was punctuated by a really cool quote by Gosling. He walks up to a guy on the street and calmly asks, ""Wanna' fight?""That line alone hints that we'd be in store for some good old fashioned head bashing. Alas, the film is almost completely devoid of action. And the fight scenes that the trailer hints at are nonexistent. The most disappointing part is that when Gosling's character finally squares off for the climactic brawl, he wholeheartedly gets his ass handed to him. What the...?Gosling plays Julian, a drug-smuggler who also manages Thai boxers. When Julian's brother is murdered, it's up to Julian to seek vengeance. The only problem is that Julian's not that into it. That is until his mother, played by Kristen Scott Thomas in a role that seems like it was created for the simple goal of ending up on ""Best Villains of All Time"" lists, forces him to do the deed.Thomas' character almost doesn't seem to fit in a film with such subtle characters and minimalist filmmaking. She's so over-the-top that you have to wonder if she walked on to the wrong set. Her character is more one dimensional that a Xerox copy.The biggest problem I have with Only God Forgives is that it was trying so hard to be cool. It's like Refn's sole objective while making the movie was to have college aged film buffs quoting lines from his film while walking around campus wearing a white t-shirt. Instead what we got was an overly pretentious, self indulgent film that was all style over substance.Don't get me wrong, the film looks great. You can tell that every scene was painstakingly framed and lit. This is where the film really does succeed. The cinematography is truly fantastic as well as the set design and lighting. It's some of the best production values you will see in a film all year. The first half of the film is bathed in a red hue. It might get to be annoying to some, and I'm not sure there was an actual reason for this. Is it supposed to represent the rage building in Julian or the bloodbath that's about to ensue?We might never know because Only God Forgives doesn't really seem interested in creating much of a story. In fact, there's not a whole lot of dialogue in the film. Most scenes consist of mind-numbingly slow tracking shots, or zoom ins. Or moments where Gosling just stares at the camera. Like the director is saying, ""Look at him. He's so cool I don't even have to give him anything to say and he's still awesome.""Like Drive before it, Forgives is extremely violent, maybe more so. The main difference is that in Only God Forgives, the violence seems unnecessary and gratuitous. Many times Forgives fails where Drive succeeds, Drive was just a cool film. It didn't seem like it was trying to be cool, it just was.Only God Forgives is trying so hard to be cool and stylish that it's almost embarrassing. Directors like Tarantino and Scorsese created films and characters that were cool because they were just damn cool. It wasn't a predestined objective. Once Refn realizes that there is more to filmmaking than perfectly composing and lighting a shot or casting one of best looking male leads working today and having him stare into the camera with brooding indifference, then he will become a great director.",Only God Forgives
155,thegodfathersaga,deliberately seeks a unique quality,8,3 December 2013,"Only God Forgives lacks a conventional narrative or such parameters; it has been criticized for giving the story a secondary importance, as that was the most noteworthy attribute in a film. to be consistent, that particular criticism seems unfair to me, seeing that the film denies using familiar resources such as voice over or flashbacks, and deliberately seeks a deep introspective nature. the film really revolves around internal struggles: past and present, self-interest and moral justice, desire and violence.even when we're given information about them defined by their past, the characters never take a life of their on own; they never leave the framework designed by the filmmaker, marked by the traditional and modern looking city of Bangkok. the film is very interesting and appealing aesthetically in the way its scenes look and sound. one object that i found recurring frequently is Julian's hands. i'm still trying to figure out how to interpret it, but hands is our best and most useful biological tools, so they may imply the wrongdoings they have inflicted.Only God Forgives is maybe challenging the classical notions of what makes a film work, but i find merit in its unique form.",Only God Forgives
156,rcastl2335,An action film on Quaaludes,1,26 December 2013,"Let's start with the most important point: Ryan Gosling has ridden the dead-eyed, stonefaced acting schtick as far as it can go for him. At this early stage in his career, he simply doesn't have the life mileage, the gravitas or the looks to play at being Steve McQueen.He desperately needs to go back to, you know, ACTING. Moving onto the movie is ironic for a movie that is drugged out slow when not frozen completely, filled with innumerable tracking shots down hallways to people sitting perfectly still in whatever room the director decided to decorate that day. (I can only assume that the per diem package for participants included an opium pipe.)The script, such as it is, aims for that odd, defeated junction where pretentious meets silly. Besides Gosling, there is an actor playing a cop who sings karaoke and brutalizes people. Kristin Scott Thomas curses fragrantly in her scenes. There is a fight scene that looks like a 6th grader was pitted against Bruce Lee. The set decoration and photography are gorgeous though, some of the richest, most sumptuous (the only word that fits) in recent film history.

158,advaitkamat,"Artsy, ditsy and diabolical.",7,21 August 2013,"I have been an avid follower of Nicolas Winding Refn's grand visual style ever since I saw ""Drive"", a movie that was unapologetically self-assertive and contrastive than the usual romantic-thrillers we get to see. But ""Drive"" had a huge advantage over ""Only God Forgives"". That is, in ""Drive"", the emotions aren't theatrical. Two movies by the same director and both the antithesis of one another. In ""Only God Forgives"", Refn tries to foster art-house cinema, something that we so rarely get to see and creates a movie, a mood, so radically different that it ends up being an experience and not merely a film.Billy (Tom Burke), an English gangster, runs a Thai-boxing club in Bangkok as a front for his drug business. Billy's younger brother, Julian (Ryan Gosling), an emotional and quieter version of Billy, helps him. When Billy's fetish for violence erupts one night, he brutally murders a young, underage prostitute. When the cops arrive at the crime scene, one cop, Lt. Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), known as 'God' or 'Angel Of Vengeance', decides to serve justice his way. He allows the father of the murdered girl to do whatever he wishes with Billy, who has not left the crime scene.When the livid father beats Billy to death, Chang cuts his hand off. Julian finds out about his brother's murder but decides to let the father live after hearing his version of the story. Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), Julian's mother, comes to Bangkok to see her first son's dead body and give him a proper burial. After finding out that Julian is not ready to avenge his brother's murder, she decides to do it and sends a few people to kill the father. But soon she figures that the man really behind it is still alive and that her son, whom she ridicules, is fascinated by him. ""Only God Forgives"" is mostly based in the dark, eerie alleyways of Bangkok. Refn, teaming up with cinematographer Larry Smith yet again, effectively fabricates a sinister mood throughout. Though the movie is lethargic and somewhat hollow, it immensely fascinates with its stylistic approach that is reminiscent of ""Drive"". Appallingly violent, gleefully audacious and emotionally arid, it's a plucky delineation of male rage, something that directors fear tackling and risk going overboard with it but Refn here does it so well that I can't say ""Only God Forgives"" is about anything else. If it is, I wouldn't know. This is a movie that's ambitious and aware of its audacity. It's crafted elegantly, and as is Refn's style, with brutal, bloody, limbs-flying and well-choreographed violent sequences that can't be classified as action. And the violence is backed by a magical score by Cliff Martinez, a score that's beautifully ethnic. Classy that is.""Only God Forgives"" is a movie that'll be met with stark opinions. Me, I loved it because I haven't seen a movie quite like this in a long, long time. But with the others, it may not go down so well. And that's completely understandable. For one, the violence is hard to stomach and the problem is, it's thematic. Secondly, it's too vague with it's silent characters, often inaudible and idiosyncratic dialog and unspoken desires. The pacing is slow, the plot predictable and often surreal. Not much of it makes sense but, then again, a lot of it does. That's where the problem lies - it's how you interpret it. Gosling gives a slightly unbalanced performance as Julian, emoting more with his few lines than with his face. Often quiet and expressionless, it's difficult to interpret his character. The same applies to Pansringarm, who credibly creates an aura of fear though the scope for character growth is limited. Maybe the performances were meant to be the way they are - cold, expressionless, piercing - because the same applies to many of the performances in the movie. Thomas is fantastic as Crystal, devilish and smart, she gives the performance that defines the film.""Only God Forgives"" is a homage to art cinema from a director who knows his passions and indulgences and fashions them accordingly. Not many would find it enjoyable, maybe because it was never meant to be, but it's captivating and beastly, like a seething creature waiting to lash out. There's beauty in it, a beauty that you rarely get to see. Hypnotic.",Only God Forgives
159,krice23,Having a hard time knowing what to think!,7,22 May 2018,"I like to flatter myself by thinking I have a reasonably sophisticated film palette but If I hadn't First read the review by Frostychud I wouldn't have had more than a base clue as to what in hell was going on in this movie, except perhaps to deduce that white people should just stay out of Thailand altogether. 
I mean, I literally have so many questions fogging my brain right now I can't compel them into anything resembling a cohesive structure. Worse yet, I don't know whether to feel chumped or just plain dense! Not a place I'm used to finding myself, I must say. 
Under normal circumstances I would give it another viewing. I've certainly watched movies before that have taken me more than one viewing to take in everything offered. And although this film does have its fine points, overall it feels like it's trying entirely too hard to be artsy, with timing going well beyond the pregnant pause and lighting too perfectly placed the setup time alone must have made a serious dent in the budget. Don't even get me started on how they expected to sell a vigilante police inspector (? Capt.?; Chief?) dispensing his own form of justice at the end of a kitana blade he carries around on his back! 
I'll give you a few examples of what I did like. Across the board the performances were well done, if, at times, somewhat overly nuanced. Of course, Gosling and Thomas are always spectacular. The ladies costumes, hair, & makeup were supurb! The use of the inaudible in place of dialogue in scenes showing high stress conditions was clever and well done. This is one of the few films that filmed dark but not black; in other words, I could still See Everything! Nothing drives me to distraction more than a scene filmed so dark you can't make out anything, having no clue what you're supposed to be seeing.

160,paultreloar75,Mesmerising,9,2 August 2013,"First thing I read about Only God Forgives was how it wasn't at all like Drive, despite the obvious connections. Which was a blessed relief, because I wasn't at all impressed with that production. I'm not entirely sure that Ryan Gosling does much more this time around anyway. But somehow it, and he, work really well together.Compellingly mesmeric in its visual and aural intensity, we drop into an uncomplicated tale of murder, revenge and complicated domestic situations. All sorts of themes are explored, from loyalty and discipline to perversion and reality. The images and sounds that appear combine to provide a rapturous meal for your mind, feeding all kinds of thoughts and feelings well after the event.Kristin Scott Thomas is formidable, she is intimidating, scary, weak and all sorts, a real tour de force. Vithaya Pansringarm also adds a great deal with his quiet dignified samurai avenger, and the various sides we see of him provide another layer again. Shades of Suspiria for me in the colours and lights, and I strongly got a little homage to Ichi the Killer, which was wonderful.Echoes of Twin Peaks and Lost Highway for sure, but in a real good way. I think Nicolas Winding Refn has finally hit his straps and made something that has some proper longevity, as I'd certainly like to see this again. It's hypnotic and intense and at points, quite disturbing but not gratuitous somehow. You learn about the characters by an osmosic process, drink in the various moods of downtown Bangkok, and enter a world that you'd really rather you never had to see. Brilliant stuff.",Only God Forgives
161,TimMeade,Even the greatly talented sometimes mis-fire,4,5 August 2013,"It would be an understatement to say that I had been looking forward to the release of Only God Forgives from Danish-born film director and writer Nicolas Winding Refn, teaming up once more with Ryan Gosling. Their 2011 collaboration, Drive, I rated as the best film seen that year.Drive was a crime thriller that took standard clichés from that genre and twisted them cleverly with a subtle nuance to produce a film that was fresh and invigorating.Only God Forgives is a crime thriller that has taken standard clichés from that genre and twisted them to produce a film that is cliché ridden, spiteful and with nothing new to say.The film centres around an American drug smuggling family whose operation is run by two brothers, Billy (Tom Burke) and the younger Julian (Ryan Gosling) fronting as owners of a Thai boxing club in Bangkok. The depraved and apparently psychotic Billy is brutally murdered – an honour killing after he himself abused and brutally murdered a 16 year old prostitute. This provokes the family matriarch, the widowed Crystal Thompson (Kristin Scott Thomas) to fly in from The States to ensure revenge is enacted. She is pitted against Lt Chang, a police officer complicit in Billy's death.The film was a strange mix of ultra violent set pieces, interspersed with surreal dream-like episodes and two very odd scenes where Lt Chang, a clinically efficient killer, singing karaoke – the point of these scenes escaped me.There was little dialogue in this movie which at only 90 minutes long had far too many ponderous scenes with long silences punctuated by taciturn and non-convincing conversation. The one exception to this was when Kristin Scott Thomas in an excoriating attack on her younger son totally emasculates him in front of his girlfriend, comparing him unfavourably to her beloved late elder son - the suggestion of incest was perhaps mooted. Other scenes hinted at Gosling's character having a complicated and troubled sexuality.Kristin Scott Thomas gave a fine performance. Her Lady Macbeth style portrayal of burning, barely controlled anger and hatred seeking the bloodiest revenge was intense. Ryan Gosling was on auto-pilot, yet again playing a silent type conveying emotion with an enigmatic half smile or arched eyebrow. A similar portrayal by him of his character in Drive was beguiling; a repeat performance in The Place Beyond the Pines he got away with. Not only is it now beginning to wear a bit thin, it was a distinct barrier in this movie to understanding where he stood in the piece, what were his motivations.Stylistically, the film had great merit – the cinematography and lighting were both of the highest order - Refn knows how to frame a scene and his skill as a film-maker is beyond dispute. The sound effects during the many episodes of violence were always rather clumsy, however – I suspect Refn concentrates on the visuals.Only God Forgives is a film that has split opinion, receiving boos and standing ovations at screenings – often simultaneously. Sometimes a talented film-maker can create something too far ahead of its time. What seems specious and nasty to many on release can in later years be re-evaluated, its qualities finally understood. I think in particular of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom. In 1960, its sexual violence and perceived voyeurism was unappreciated by critics and audiences alike. Such was the opprobrium, it all but ended the career of Powell who had, along with Emeric Pressburger, created so many timelessly enduring British films. But now, Peeping Tom has been rehabilitated and regarded by most as an all-time classic. Whether Refn's Only God Forgives will ultimately fall into this category, only time will tell. And I will stand to be corrected.",Only God Forgives
162,i_ianchev,The hands,10,20 July 2013,"A movie about forgiveness. This is a perfect blend of western and eastern philosophy. It is a message rather than a movie. Only God forgives. And we can see clearly why the director Refn chose Thailand. A land of so many controversies. A land of good and bad, of beauty and ugliness. But it's not only Thailand. It's every country in the world. Because we don't change as people, we only find new reasons to be bad, or be good. The only way we can change ourselves is by asking God for forgiveness. For we are not the ones to judge others. We are all fluctuating in our lives. And that's why the main character in this movie is on his path to redemption. To redeem his hands from the deeds he has done before. Despite the fact that he is a mere consequence of his family's history, he feels ugly and filthy from the inside before he meets Chang. And at the end when he has been purified by God, although he is filthy and ugly on the outside, inside he is purified from the hatred, from the badness he felt. Chang is not the God following all characters for their deeds. He is a true force of nature - no dualism, no judgementalism. And when the nature has achieved balance, it calms down. We are engulfed in a dark red fairy tail with no temporal or spacial boundaries. The music is not music, it is the sound of emotions which run from the directors vision. It's a perfect blend. An hour and a half transcendence of the surreal and real, braided on the walls of claustrophobic corridors. And still we can breath the air coming from the path of Julian before us. The calm breeze embracing a redeemed personality. Which is no longer afraid to look at his life (hands). Magnifique!",Only God Forgives
163,stjackson10,6/10,6,22 March 2020,"I'll say this: I'm not confident that I understood this movie. So I am doing something different than what I normally do, and that's writing a preliminary review based on my own interpretation of the film, and then potentially responding to it again after I've had a chance to read some literature on it.Here's my initial response:
I think this movie might be too weird for its own good. It feels like it can't decide if it wants to be a mainstream thriller or a quirky, no rules, indie flick. There were many elements that seemed to clash. It was strangely sexual for seemingly no reason. It was tonally unlike anything I've seen in a long time, and frankly its the first movie in some time that I've watched and truly had no idea what it wanted to say to me. There's a weird exploration of the relationship between a mother and son, an interesting take on judgement as is God's to bestow (and is the judgement of the ""detective"" a juxtaposition to the implied forgiveness in the title?).I've given this much thought, and I don't think I feel much closer to the truth. I think I need to immerse myself into explanations.",Only God Forgives
164,aequus314,Just another anti-revenge flick trying to emulate Jodorowsky and Artaud,2,27 November 2014,"As I write this entry, I still find myself wondering how many viewers have misplaced their fondness for this film simply because the same composer Cliff Martinez, scored Harmony Korine's visceral neo-noir teen drama, Spring Breakers.The most problematic and fallacious point in Only God Forgives positioning itself along the genius of Jodorowsky and Artaud's ""Theatre of Cruelty"", is that of unfortunate difference in the way hyper violence was used — as a discipline to uphold thematic ideas (anti-bourgeois), or a desperate tool to imply macho substance. In the case of El Topo for example, Jodorowsky expanded both the visual and narrative capabilities of violent cinema by fusing and rewarding it with vibrations in religion and mythology. Refn on the other hand, asserts himself only in the literal vacuums of mise-en-scène and the concrete word. At best I'd call it an objectivist's notion of surrealist drama. At worst, just another anti-revenge flick seeking to exploit and to emulate, yet severely underestimating the real point of Artaud's pursuit. I find it terribly unconvincing and pretentious. Can't decide whether Nicolas Winding Refn was crying out for a Lars Von Trier or Park Chan-wook but either way, the film is self- indulgent, boring and full of tired clichés.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",Only God Forgives

167,supernma,Visually mesmerizing...and that's about it,6,20 July 2013,"The latest film from Danish auteur Nicolas Winging Refn (director of ""Drive"" and ""Bronson"") finds (again) a subdued but dangerous Ryan Gosling with violent tendencies out for revenge. While it's almost impossible not to compare this film to Refn's much praised 2011 thriller ""Drive"", I will try to judge this film on its own merits.Visually the film is glorious, featuring lighting that covers every spectrum of the color wheel. I think it's safe to say that Bangkok has never looked better, and that's why ""Only God Forgives"" may just be the best looking film of 2013. Long, slow push-ins down starkly lit corridors recall the films of Stanley Kubrick, and the no-flinching, often surreal violence reminds one of the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky (to whom this film is dedicated). That being said, a perfect film this is not.There are no characters in ""Only God Forgives"", simply shells of people doing horrible things - it's easy (and perhaps too convenient) to make the leap that these figures are metaphors. What do they represent? What message is Refn so desperately not trying to convey? I don't know. I didn't know anything while watching this film. Certain moments are certainly happening in real time - in reality - but these scenes are interspersed with moments that blend reality, dreams, and metaphorical filmmaking, leaving the audience scratching their heads.I'm sure it will require repeat viewings to get the full effect. And while I never found the film to be boring or uninteresting (I'd say it's anything but), I did find myself totally lost at times, perhaps over thinking what I'm supposed to feel, which characters are true, which images really exist. I'm not dull; I don't ask to be spoon-fed anything. However, there's a difference between letting the audience figure things out for themselves and deliberately hiding your themes and character motives from them.In short, the film is truly style over substance, but I can't hate it for that because the style is so damn masterful. I could stare it for hours, but I will never be invested in the story or the characters who are too repulsive and contrived to truly hate or sympathize with. Watch ""Only God Forgives"" if you are a die-hard art house fanatic; if quality cinematography alone wets your appetite. If you're looking for an easy good time, avoid at all costs.",Only God Forgives
168,the_bluesman,"A surreal, gritty and excessively violent art-house experience!",9,31 August 2016,"Very recently, I watched Nicolas Winding Refn's most recent work 'The Neon Demon' (2016) and, while I was quite impressed with its cast, its visual look and its score, I don't think it's the masterpiece many audience reviews make it out to be. I don't quite agree with the generally negative professional reviews either because the movie certainly has style, but it lacks a real plot that goes somewhere and it becomes ridiculously gory and repellent at the end, which is not consistent with the otherwise slow-paced, surreal style of the rest of the movie.That being said, I had seen Refn's 'Drive' (2011) before and liked it quite a bit, so, despite the overly negative reviews and ratings it has received over the past few years, I gave 'Only God Forgives' a shot as I had never gotten around to watching it since its release in 2013. Actually, I hadn't gotten around to finishing watching it as I had in fact seen the first 20 minutes or so back when it came out, but for some reason I had stopped it and never picked up where I had left off. I don't really know why but the generally negative consent of the critics had a lot to do with that I guess. Nevertheless, now that I have seen the whole movie, I am baffled that it is regarded so lowly. It's my favorite Refn movie I have seen so far.The plot of 'Only God Forgives' is a very straightforward story about revenge and its consequences, which is simplistic on the surface yet conveys a deeper meaning. The movie is also characterized by its surrealism and its excessive violence, which is not for the faint of heart. It's like art-house Tarantino! Aside from violence, unlike in Tarantion's movies, there is not much dialogue in 'Only God Forgives' but what is there often contains black humor, which I like a lot. The restaurant scene with Ryan Golsing's character, his mother and his girlfriend is such a black-humored scene. Ryan Gosling's stare in that scene is brilliant. Although he doesn't say much in the whole movie, I think Gosling is perfectly cast because of his piercing stare. Vithaya Pansringarm is also perfect as the main villain. He is terrifying but also quite funny in a number of karaoke scenes.Other than 'The Neon Demon', where I think the over-the-top gore at the end is out of place, this movie is relentlessly brutal and gory from the beginning and it works really well in my opinion because this style is kept throughout the movie. There are many elements in 'Only God Forgives' that you can also find in 'The Neon Demon' like the use of colors and shadows, surrealism, slow-paced cinematography, limited dialogue, and a moody electro-score by Cliff Martinez, but it doesn't all come together so fluently in the latter movie. The slow pacing of 'Only God Forgives' coupled with Martinez' score is very effective in building up to the unavoidable confrontations between the characters in the movie, which there are plenty of and they all end very violently. The slow buildup to the various brutal showdowns reminds me of late 1960s westerns like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (1968) or Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' (1969). The similarities don't end with slow pacing and violent showdowns, though. Just as in those gritty westerns, there are no good characters in Refn's 'Only God Forgives.' They are all bad or evil in one way or another.In conclusion, I think this is a very well-made movie that for some reason doesn't appeal to the majority of critics and viewers alike. It's surreal and excessively violent but also fun in a way. I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed the movie after reading some of the negative reviews and watching the half-baked 'The Neon Demon.' This is my favorite of Refn's movies I have seen.",Only God Forgives
169,JustApt,Oriental Justice,9,6 October 2013,Only God Forgives is a modern endeavour to revive the genre of revenge tragedy that takes place in the extremely exotic environment. The revenge tragedy is a form of drama in which the dominant motive is revenge for a real or imagined injury. It was extremely popular in the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras and William Shakespeare's Hamlet is the best known example. In Only God Forgives which is also made in the style of film noir a crime brings forth an act revenge which fathers a new revenge so the vengeance and cruelty keep multiplying. The distressed characters wander in fear through the endless empty corridors and deserted night streets but they can't escape the overwhelming terror. And the suffocating atmosphere of this crime drama is intentionally and effectively made crushingly depressing.,Only God Forgives
170,temrok9,A walk on the wild side,8,20 September 2013,"I'm not a fan of Drive.And I wasn't prepared for the evolution from that movie to Only God forgives.Most reviews I've read were harsh on this one;in the theater most people felt uneasy, didn't understand what this is all about;many critics found the movie going nowhere too.If you are interested in plots, you miss the whole movie;in fact, you can learn all about the plot here and know nothing about the movie.This is good for me;in fact, this is exactly what I need cinema to be:a world of its own.Only God forgives is a movie that comes from outer space, an alien that bears some relation to the cinema of Lynch and of Kubrick, a mesmerizing labyrinth that absorbs you in its atmospheric universe.It's true that trying to be something like that isn't always successful and it usually ends up in nonsense if a director lacks talent vision and skill.But when someone succeeds, as I consider this to be the case here, I am reminded of my reasons for loving cinema so much.So take a walk on the wild side and watch Only God forgives. You may clear your mind from the useless and ugly repetitions that Hollywood has forced us to watch over and over again over the last years;you may rediscover the beauty of pure film-making, the essence of making movies.Or you may feel bored and deceived(many did).I think it's worthwhile to take the chance!",Only God Forgives
171,stock-1,a Commie movie flick,7,14 June 2014,"Ever heard about a singing police chief from Bangkok, by the name of Chang, who never bothered with prosecutors, courtrooms, or anything else but only justice if it was from his own sword? If that sounds familiar, this is the one movie to watch. A very strange and sinister odor comes from this piece of HD celluloid. If its a digital only mastering they might get away with this piece of filth. The indigenous people of Bangkok must have been shivering for this wannabe Thai dude ever since the ending of World War II. When Chang sings he stands in front of a Calligraphic painting of the Chinese wall. That got me thinking. Are we are watching a Chinese police officer where his audience of uniformed police officers are just some renegade outpost squad from the Communist Republic of China, i.e. Chinese NKVD in Thai Police uniform? Currently the news is that types of the same nasty caliber have committed a state coup in Thailand. After watching this I really wonder what that is all about. Something is really wrong and rotten with 'Only God Forgives'. The movie ends with Ryan Gosling, the one son who was actually not the evil hateful type, getting his arms slashed off, by way of justice by Chang, the Thai Chief of Police wannabe from Chinese variety and Communist hatch. As finale Chang sings yet another song for his death squad. By naming the movie 'Only God Forgives' it's suggested that Chang and his squad might get away with their actions, but after watching i get a sense that involved script writers, producers and directors have absolutely not a single clue about these things.",Only God Forgives
172,R-P-McMurphy,Raging Bull as directed by Gaspar Noe and special guest director David Lynch,7,6 July 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" is a psychological thriller with elements of surrealism and expressionism. For me ""Drive"" is in a way a modern remake of ""Taxi Driver"" as directed by David Lynch, so with this expect to see Nicolas Winding Refn's version of ""Raging Bull"" as directed by Gaspar Noe. Does that make any sense?I really shouldn't have seen the trailers, they really ruin a lot of scenes in it. Metaphorically speaking, its about a man's fight against god himself for having his brother killed, after he raped and killed an underage prostitute.Nicolas Winding Refn, the director, was there for the screening (I even got to take a picture with him) and before it started he described ""Drive"" as a cocaine trip and ""Only God Forgives"" as an acid trip, he said this because he's a surrealist like David Lynch, in other words a magician, and that means that he's not going to let the audience know how he does the trick, he's only going to show it to them. Even after the screening he kept on answering interesting questions with ridiculous answers to cover the truth, the movie is really ambiguous, so answering anything would ruin the magic in it.Something tells me that this movie, like Kubrick's movies, will be recognized as a great film in a few years from now or it could just turn into a cult movie similar to ""Blue Velvet"". There will be walkouts, as there were in the screening I attended, and people mad at what they just saw, but I think they have to agree that its hard to keep your eyes off the movie when you're watching it, I did so for a second and missed an unexpected action sequence.The movie obviously isn't for everyone, it can be a very nauseating experience, but not more so than Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"". I could go into all the symbolism (the sword, God, death, religion, incest, violence) and what every single thing meant, but I won't, thats left the viewer to decide. Nicolas Winding Refn may describe it as a drug movie, but I can tell he's lying, being as organized as he is (just look at videos were he explains his process in doing a movie), I could see something very personal hidden in this movie, similar to how ""Raging Bull"" is one of Scorsese's most personal works.I'd recommend it to people who liked movies like ""Animal Kingdom"", ""Bronson"", ""Bullhead"", ""La Haine"", ""City of God"", or any other I already mentioned.",Only God Forgives
173,mecheart,Imagery replaces cohesive story in Gosling's latest Michael Mann imitation,2,14 August 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Only God Forgives' is a film driven by smoky, hypnotic images and use of language and gore to shock the viewer. Paced slowly enough to generate distraction in the viewer who expects a coherent sequence of events to occur within an interval capable of building suspense or maintaining interest, this film turns away from the telling of an urgent narrative and trades story for effusive metaphors perhaps less obvious than even the writer intended. While enjoyment of 'Only God Forgives' possibly hinges on how deeply the viewer is willing to read into its sequence of red and violet tinged images, reasoning too deeply into what transpires might well be a waste of time.If you've regularly watched movies for a decade or more, you've almost certainly encountered before this style of film making. The vast depiction of character time on screen is devoted to the making of various expressions and the performing of mostly subtle body language synchronized to the visual rhythms of settings and situations. The images here drop hints and both the hints and the characters themselves apparently serve as metaphors for some grand tale which for whatever reason, the writer chose to hide behind suggestion, foul language and extreme violence. Some call it art. Most moviegoers seeking a captivating story populated by characters who develop within the arc of the plot will find this ""style"" lacking.To test whether or not 'Only God Fogives' is a film for you, watch several episodes of the original 'Miami Vice' television show and while doing so imagine each scene with far less dialog, louder music, disjointed events and every character as unlikeable, and set to the backdrop of a culture you know nothing about.'Only God Fogives' offers up a minimalist cinematic art style, mixes it with monotonous color, uses its actors almost like mimes and then seeks to punctuate its purely visual substance with cohesive violence that serves only to shock rather than suit a specific relevance within the story arc.I am certain most have read the synopsis however, one ought to discard that block of text as it really does not accurately convey what the viewer is in for. Rather, a better synopsis would be as follows. A grandmaster of a Thai martial art aids the police by lopping off limbs, gutting the bad guys and running through defenseless women - all with a sword he somehow carries out of sight along his spine. The real suspense in this film is wondering when and who the mysterious martial arts grandmaster is going to chop up next.As a fan of the style of film making used by Nicolas Winding Refn in 'Drive', I must caution that while I wondered how said film would have played with an even less cohesive a narrative, the demonstration of such that is 'Only God Forgives' is not much to my liking.Stories told or rather hinted at, in films like 'Only God Forgives' cheapen the value of human life and demand that the viewer readjust his or her own morals for the duration, or squirm in their seat as consequence.Vapid characterization, barrages of hinting, hypnotic, smoky images and characters that amount to uniformly bland and mute save for one or two whose participation amounts to the spouting of foul language or use of bladed objects as performance aids, seek to convey the value of high art, yet ultimately reduce the sum they achieve when it all boils down to blood, guts and laughably shocking language.Read as deeply as you choose into 'Only God Forgives' - if you are up for a lesson in antiquated Freudian psychoanalysis. Me, I'd rather get my cinematic fix elsewhere.I cannot recommend 'Only God Forgives' to any particular fan-base. Two out of ten for bringing to the screen a martial arts style I was not familiar with, and making it look cool up on the silver screen.",Only God Forgives

Lame and tedious, boring and victim to its arty attempt to be 'cool'. I tried so hard to persevere because I loved Driver.

Way too many long lingering scenes which try too hard to convey angst and precipitation.

But, as confirmed by the director, Nicolas Winding Refn, the plot really focuses on a man's journey towards fighting God.This does occur, but why? Why does this movie have to feature multiple violent and gruesome death scenes along with a graphic torture scene? When I sat through these scenes I didn't look at them literally. They are symbolic. They either represent God's forgiveness or God's wrath, but in most cases it demonstrates God's mercy. This is very important to the plot because it shows the viewer what kind of God this movie is portraying without the use dialogue.This movie also gives us a look at the Devil or Julian's Mom who constantly leads Julian ""avenge"" his brother Billy who was killed by God. This is where the whole Man fighting God thing comes up. Julian is fueled by an insestual love of his mother or the love of the Devil but is free of this love when Chang, God, kills Crystal, Julian's mother or the Devil. Even though he no longer loves the Devil the evil his hand have caused must be punished through the ceremonial removing of the hands by God. Now that the movie's plot has been laid out on the Table I can confidently give this movie an A. The only thing that prevents it from receiving an A+ is the gruesome and unneeded torture scene.",Only God Forgives

It has been a very long time since I saw a film I wanted to walk out of (my friend paid so I felt obliged to stay).There are so many bad aspects to this film. I understand what the filmmakers were trying to convey (at least I think I do) but it is so incoherent that you will find it difficult to appreciate this film. What I disliked is a follows: little dialogue which in two occasions cuts outs whilst music is only heard, long stares, awkward sexual encounters which serve no purpose, more long stares, scenes jump all over the place requiring the viewer to make sense of this mess, incoherent plot, even more long stares, I could go on.The only positive aspect of this film was the violence.

Both are flashy and colourful, but with Drive, a character was presented with a heart, the story was good, and the soundtrack even better. With Drive, we got a compelling story with heart and soul, but with Refn's new film, we only get the flash.Only God Forgives is a treat for the senses. It plays like a dream, monotone music playing in the background while a dream-like image dances on the screen. It doesn't play so much as a movie, but rather as a series of still images spliced together to create something picturesque. And while that may be admirable and even loved by some, it is only the thing the film has worth any redeeming value. It is a great looking film, but there is a total and complete lack of story and character. The story is your basic revenge flick you've seen a thousand times before, and Gosling's character is a complete monotone, emotionless wreck of a character. While some may find him artful and compelling, it does not make for a good movie to see your main character stare at his hands for five minutes and speak five lines throughout the whole film.And that is the film's main drawback. Nothing happens. What we get is characters briefly interacting with each other, while the rest of the time, artful and dream-like images dance across the screen with bright colours and picturesque cinematography. Everyone moves slowly, talks slowly, and the movie itself trods along at such a slow pace that molasses would look quick flowing next to it. While artful and picturesque images may be compelling, a film needs a compelling story with actual character to back it up, but without it, this film simply becomes a pretty picture with no backbone or filling.",Only God Forgives

The charters don't treat the country with respect, and if this is supposed to be some kind of statement, it fails in all possible intended variations.All the ridiculously over done, tyring-to-hard scenes shot with weird lighting when normal lighting would have sufficed = idiotic.

187,mwburrows,"It is a piece of art, not a thriller.",8,19 July 2013,"Think back to 2011 for a moment. When Refn's Drive came up under the radar as an overnight hit and created a legion of breathless fanboys. There was enough energy and excitement surrounding Only God Forgives to echo any number of disappointments in film over the years, and it was galling to have all the potent ingredients of Drive that we've all come to enjoy, but no sooner has the first chapter of OGF concluded than we realise it is a very different sibling of the same family.With clinical, gory precision, the body count rises quickly with no small measure of subtlety. The surgically composed violence of Drive is dealt out in buckets in OGF, somewhat lessening its impact, but gripping and shocking all the same. In fact, one of the fundamental flaws of OGF, in my opinion, is that it uses too much violence to get the point across, and too little characterisation. There is literally less than six pages of dialogue in the whole film. The focus is entirely visual and aural. That being said, there's an overwhelming abundance of symbolism for the audience to interpret as they want, which is one of the film's triumphs. The ending is left for you to ponder and its meaning will be different to all viewers. Many seemingly pointless scenes in OGF have strong underlying themes and messages that may not be immediately apparent to you, but will linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled. I can see how the critics are divided with OGF's lack of substance. I understand it. But once you start looking at it as a piece of art rather than a thriller or crime film you will get the most out of it. I think this is the biggest criticism of Only God Forgives. There are no twists and the narrative is very straightforward. It's value lies in its imagery and symbolism, which it does better than anyone else in 2013. That being said if you're looking for an edge of your seat thriller you'll be disappointed. It certainly hooked me, but not with adrenaline. I was hypnotised by the landscapes and the slow-burning evolution of ideas that were portrayed. It very much has the same pacing as ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", or ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance."" If you enjoyed either of those, you will get something out of Only God Forgives.Go into the cinema like it's an art exhibit with an open mind and an eye for detail and you will not be disappointed.",Only God Forgives
188,ryandannar,"""Only God Forgives"" is a very good film that most people will not like.",8,30 July 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" is hypnotic, sinister, transgressive, rebellious, sadistic, elusive, surreal, gorgeous, and brilliant. Make no mistake: This movie is not meant to be a crowd-pleaser. The mall-crowd will hate it. But it is a dense, inspired, challenging work that is stunningly beautiful to watch, regardless of the violence on display.Regarding that: This film is quite violent, yes. But geez, I've read some reviews that seem to give the impression that the level of violence in this film represents some new, horrific, inexcusable plateau of violence in modern filmmaking. That's ridiculous. If you've seen any Korean action films, or American horror films from the last decade, or any of the works of Takashi Miike (Ichi the Killer), you'll find this film far less violent in comparison. Shoot, depending on how you look at it, the average Michael Bay flick is far more violent than this.The difference, I think, is that the violent acts in ""Only God Forgives"" are underscored with troubling subtext. And moreover, the film is permeated in psychological violence; disturbing insinuations are everywhere, from bloody acts that happen off-screen -- leaving our imaginations to fill-in the details -- to the disturbingly Freudian relationship that the main character, Julian (Ryan Gosling) has with his mother.The violence in this film -- both the physical and the psychological -- is contained, coiling under the surface and exploding in brief, quick moments to punctuate the film's languid, hypnotic pacing.The film's revenge story, which you can glean well enough from the trailers, is mostly used as a clothesline over which the director (Nicholas Winding Refn) can hang -- not action scenes, as one might expect -- but hallucinatory visuals and disturbing symbolic motifs. In some ways, one might watch ""Only God Forgives"" as an exploration of cinema's power to evoke ideas and emotions using the basic tools of light, color, movement, sound, and editing.But there is more to it than just that; dry exercises in style don't provoke and sting and fascinate like this film does. The character of Julian, for one thing, is a compelling sort of enigma. He would seemingly prefer not to get caught-up in the whole revenge-drama, but is pressured into it by his mother, who insults his manhood. It is strongly implied that Julian holds unseemly feelings for his mother -- and yet, he doesn't enjoy being bullied by her, and he seems to be troubled by his Oedipal impulses. In an early scene, we find Julian in a brothel, meeting a prostitute he favors. He sits, and presumably at his request, she ties his hands to the chair, so that he can't move as she proceeds to get freaky on the bed, alone. This is only one of many instances in which we're shown that Julian has a desire to be made powerless. It ties-in with the conflicted feelings he has for his mother. The exploration of these intertwined ideas becomes one of the film's major themes, and certain things are revealed late in the film that bring the subject into a more telling light.In trying to describe the feeling of watching this film, I keep thinking about this one image, this wallpaper pattern that appears on the interior walls of that brothel I mentioned. In stark black and gold, it depicts fearsome, sharp-toothed dragons, long and serpentine, intertwined as if in mating, or battle, or both. It is a fascinating image, dense and complex, both beautiful and disturbing. That, in a nutshell, describes how I felt about the entire film. It's the effect that I think this film is trying to create.I noticed in the closing credits that the director, Nicholas Winding Refn, thanks both Alejandro Jorodowski, and Gaspar Noe. If you know who those filmmakers are, then you'll have an idea of what you're in for here, and you'll probably enjoy it. Personally, I was reminded also of Dario Argento's ""Suspiria,"" and its bold use of color and unsettling compositions.At any rate, this is a movie that film-geeks and counter-cultural types may warm to, as I did. Mainstream film-goers, not at all.",Only God Forgives

From sleepwalk inducing performances to some rather unimaginative gore I found the whole tawdry affair to be deadly dull.The director also seems to be trying way to hard for my liking, steeping every scene in pretentious symbolism to the point that you can almost hear him droning on in press junkets as to how deep the whole film really is.It's not deep, it's dull. It's not inventive, it's derivative of better films like Blue Velvet, so derivative in fact that I almost expected to see Kyle Maclachlan pop up and say, ""Here I am""The only reason this gets 3 stars is because it's prettily shot.

190,d-JCB,brilliant surrealist film from master Nicolas Winding Refn - a long way away from Drive...,8,8 December 2013,"""Drive"" is a masterpiece genre film where Refn played with the conventions a fair bit, especially a film outta Hollywood... ""God Only Forgives"" is a surreal film, where the director is exploring uncharted realms... if u have seen the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky - who the film is dedicated to, you should know not to take everything u see at face value - look within, reflect, read up on others interpretations & watch again... i cant wait to see it again cause there's still so much to experience in it, and this is the first step into a new direction for Nicolas Winding Refn, cause his next film is an adaptation of a Jororowsky graphic novel - so try to get comfortable with the directors new approach, cause i predict you wont see another ""Drive"" for a while - 8/10",Only God Forgives
191,brendan-268,A rather pointless gorefest that fails to live up to Refn's previous effort,3,20 July 2013,"I really liked Nicolas Winding Refn's previous offering of Drive. It had a coherent narrative, characters we could care about, and it used the stylistic cinematography with intelligent precision.Only God Forgives, however, didn't really do anything of these things.Not only was the stylistic cinematography so totally overused, but this film reeked of imitation, rather than originality.I would describe it as a collection of concepts stolen from Kubrick, Tarantino and Nicolas Winding Refn's previous movie Drive.The violence is totally gratuitous and toxic to the structure of the film. In Drive, there are one or two moments of gratuity, but they are brief and can be excused by the story that has been crafted around them. In this film the violence is constant, and it actually overwhelms any attempt at storytelling.The stylistic cinematography shots are so totally overused that the film becomes a collection of shots all grouped together, rather than a story told on film - at times it literally feels like a film-school audition reel rather than an actual movie.The only characters in this movie that the audience could ever possibly care about are either killed within the first ten minutes, or have very minor parts in the movie.There are one or two scenes/moments I really liked about this film (which is why it has 3 stars), but at the end of the day there just aren't enough of them strung together in any coherent way to produce a movie that I would want to watch again, or that has much in the way of redeeming features.If you want to see Nicolas Winding Refn at his best, then skip this one and see Drive instead.",Only God Forgives
192,Kelchubordnor,too slow,5,4 August 2013,"First of all I am a massive drive fan and also a Ryan Gosling fan. Unintentionally followed his career for years going right back to Young Hercules. Anyways here's the story. brother is killed and mother comes to Bangkok and asks her other son to avenge the death. There you go I just saved you whatever the entry fee is. The problem I had with the movie is just that it is too slow and thats it. Plus you really don't care about the characters they are all nasty uncaring and quite frankly you don't want to be best buddies with any of them. My main issue with the film is that I don't think the actors were given enough to do. They all did well with what they had but I think David Lynch directing may have worked better. Billy as a character is drug dealing and has a thing for raping and killing young girls teens or younger it seams. Crystal his loving mother is basically a drugs kingpin in the States and again doesn't bat an eyelid when she hears what her eldest loving son did. Julian the youngest again is a drug dealer etc who also owns/runs a boxing gym. Now I read somewhere that Ryan Gosling studied Thai Boxing for a while to prepare for the role. When he does have a fight, he is like a white belt versus a black-belt. Trust me folks this is no fight. To say he gets beaten is putting things politely. Now I can see this movie being regarded as a classic but I must admit I found it a little hard to watch at times. Saving grace the fantastic soundtrack. It wouldn't work otherwise. I'd say enjoy but I don't honestly know how many people will enjoy this movie.",Only God Forgives
193,generationfilm,Only God Forgives- Nicholas Winding Refn's Surrealist Exercise Possesses Impressively Strong Visuals but Lacks a Relevant Narrative Focus,6,15 July 2013,"Through the progression of Scandinavian filmmaker Nicholas Winding Refn's cinematic career it seems as though narrative has slowly slipped into the backseat of his highly stylized, horrifically violent, and visually entrancing presentations. Beginning with his narratively contingent Pusher trilogy and the subjective narration heavy Bronson Refn then moved to an art-house focused delivery of mood and visuals with the likes of his Werner Herzog inspired Valhalla Rising and his American cinema debut of Drive. Unfortunately any filmmaker who sets aside narrative for visual experimentation will eventually exhaust his creative dependence and lose his audience's sympathetic interest which is what occurs in his latest film the deeply haunting yet incredibly callous Only God Forgives. This purely stylistic exercise includes Refn's signature taste for ultra-violence and monosyllabic protagonists that is at times horrifically entrancing but inevitably loses itself in the filmmaker's technical coldness and refusal to include any semblance of character development or coherent narrative. There's nothing likable about the surroundings, characters, or events that take place in Refn's hellish depiction of a corrupt Bangkok underworld and though it probably isn't meant to be it certainly makes the violent seizures, the morally empty characters, and the extremely slow paced surrealism hard to swallow. While Refn has confidently tapped into his most artistic based influences, including the surrealist violence of Alejandro Jodorowsky, the dreamlike horrors of David Lynch, and the Asian underground styles of Seijun Suzuki, Only God Forgives can't get by on technical achievement alone leaving behind a visually impressive but undeniably empty film experience that has suffocating atmosphere in an overall pointless narrative. Cinematic artists such as Refn should always be given some benefit of the doubt towards their work because the artistic process alone is a profound statement on vicarious consumption and violent context but it's just rather unfortunate that he has chosen to abandon relevant narrative in order to enhance his visual mastery and moody execution. Devotees of Refn will find it difficult to defend Only God Forgives as a fully formed cohesive picture because it's his weakest film to date but paradoxically also showcases his strongest visual attributes suggesting that this is a callous, hellish resting stop on the way to developing better cinematic greatness.More on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-AQ; Other reviews: Generationfilm.net",Only God Forgives
194,beattyg,beautiful absurd violence,9,18 June 2013,"I don't like really violent movies. Walked out of Taratinos ham-fisted Django. Just managed to stay to the end of Winterbottoms beautifully stylised 'Killer Inside Me' and have not recovered from Hanekes brilliant 1997 'Funny Games' or Kubricks 'Clockwork Orange' and 'The Shining'. Believe it or not I've never watched a Schwarzenegger movie, recall Charles Bronson and Dirty Harry with affection, recognise the excellence of Scorseses 'Raging Bull'. Obviously I've seen quite particular violent movies and I'm toughened up - Cronenberg does that...............Which brings me to Nicolas Winding Refns 'Only God Forgives'. Something in the back of my mind both visually and intellectually tells me this is a fine movie. It is very, very violent and I chose to 'shut my eyes' but its also exquisitely paced and all the actors seamlessly became part of this interesting composition. How interesting that, over the years, American filmmakers like David Lynch have referenced European film-making and this contemporary European Refn references American film-making in so many subtle and beautiful ways. Is it too much to suggest Ryan Gosling was channeling the unique Robert Mitchum. A slow motion movie which resonates into slow motion thought. Not for the faint-hearted. Nicolas Winding Refn knows exactly what he's doing and is a fine filmmaker.",Only God Forgives
195,9thgraders,Only God can forgive this movie,4,4 June 2017,"I watched the trailer and I expected a lot from this movie, it seemed to have such a powerful atmosphere, an intricate and engrossing plot, a pretty good cast... To tell the truth, I couldn't wait to see it! I already knew it wasn't well-received by the public opinion and I was more than willing to give it a fair chance.No need to say that all my expectations were immensely disappointed! I sat in despair for one hour and a half wondering what was happening to me and how to get on with my life. The movie was extremely slow (I cannot stress this enough, really) the plot wasn't satisfying in any way and the acting was just... absent. I felt like watching actors who didn't play anything, at all. I'm aware that this was done on purpose but I still don't get the message today.I really tried to understand what was expected of me as a viewer but obviously failed. The only good thing about it was the visuals and the colors, but it wasn't enough! Since then I built a rating system based on this movie, Only God Forgives being the worst movie in it. I must admit I haven't seen a worst movie since.Don't watch it if you're not extremely prepared, it's not worth your precious time!",Only God Forgives

198,AlukardsCastle,Will be regarded as a classic in years to come.,10,4 August 2013,"I know that we all have our opinions, but the outrageously negative reviews this film is getting is ridiculous. My real score is closer to an 8.5/10, but I put 10/10 to help with the low score. Most of the harsh comments are from people who have only seen ""Drive"" and no other film by Nicolas Winding Refn. They keep comparing the films, and finding things to hate because it wasn't what they wanted from a 'sorta' sequel to ""Drive"". You can pretend this is a sequel to ""Drive"" since we never really learn about the Drivers life in the movie. You can just think that after the ending of ""Drive"", the Driver flees back to Bangkok where his brother is and then the events of ""Only God Forgives"" take place. Thats just a small possible plot line for if you wanna think this is a sequel to ""Drive"", even though there is a real sequel to the ""Drive"" novel called ""Driven"" that might get a film adaptation one day. But back to this movie.*Plot*Julian runs a thai boxing club as a disguise for a drug business. One day his brother kills a young prostitute and is in turn killed by the girls father as allowed by a disturbing cop named Chang. Julians mother flies in to claim the corpse and learns that Julian let the killer go. She orders one of Julians partners to have the man who killed her son killed. This starts a series of revenge murders between Chang, Julian and his mother. There are some similarities to ""Drive"" and other Refn movies here of course. The directing style and cinematography is very beautiful and gives the film a dreamy feel at times, and sometimes a nightmarish feel. Ryan Gosling basically loses all emotions for the character here. Kristin Scott Thomas character can be compared to Albert Brooks character from ""Drive"". But Kristin does an even more sadistic job and is relentlessly evil in this movie. You don't love her, but you don't hate her. None of the characters in this movie are really likable at all. Every evil decision has another evil decision from another character to counter it. During some parts of the movie Goslings character shows that he has a slight conscience of what is right and wrong. You don't feel bad for his brother being killed based on the crime he committed though. The only parts where you will really like Gosling is when he says the soon to be classic ""Wanna fight?"" line and when his character makes good moral decisions despite his emotionless delivery. But I will say this, if you are only seeing this movie because it stars Ryan Gosling, then be warned. This is nothing like any film you've seen before. There are some really picturesque shots in this film. You could pause at almost any instant and it would look like a painting you can hang up somewhere. There are very long scenes that drag out for what feels like forever, but I at least thought they were better than the agonizing ""Valhalla Rising"" film as a whole. Some scenes are very weird and will put a lot of people off. There is a scene involving Goslings characters dead mother that will surely make anyone cringe. Many people who don't have open minds about films will trash this film, and walk out on it. But that doesn't make it a bad film at all. This isn't for everybody thats for sure. That's the beauty of it. I also need to mention the soundtrack. The music features more of the 80s influenced synths from ""Drive"". Cliff Martinez who did the score for ""Drive"" and helped with the soundtrack is back scoring this film. While the score for ""Drive"" was nice, most people only remember the catchy pop/electronic songs featured the movie. However his score for this movie is better in my opinion. Though the soundtrack doesn't feature catchy 80s style pop songs, the score is more memorable and sorta reminds me of Daft Punks score for ""Tron: Legacy"". There are even parts of the soundtrack that sound similar to ""The Shining"". It really does sound great with the scenery and contrasts the violence. Oh the violence. If you have a weak stomach then be prepared. Remember the head stomping elevator scene from ""Drive""? The violence makes that scene look PG. The violence along with some of the trippy visuals really make the film very disturbing at times. The violence is also one thing people are criticizing. I can't defend the violence, but I will tell you that the scenery in every scene is gorgeous. Oh and speaking of ""The Shining"" there are hallway scenes that remind me of Kubricks filming style! I think that we could give this movie time to be liked. I just wish I could have seen the reaction from many movie goers if this movie had a wide release in the US. I think as this movie finds a release on Blu Ray/DVD that the ratings will slowly go up. Maybe there will even be an extended directors cut. This movie will probably become a cult classic in years to come. The low score here will go up into at least a 7/10 I hope. The low scores on other prominent movie sites will most likely go up too as people start to open there minds for this film and stop comparing it to ""Drive"". But if you don't like different, weird, violent, trippy movies, then I can't recommend this to you. Otherwise, be prepared for some crazy weird scenes!",Only God Forgives
199,rodolphefleury-182-126991,Absolute Masterpiece,10,23 February 2014,"If you're familiar with the eccentric eastern European philosopher, called Slavoj Zizek who has committed 'Lacanian' interpretation of famous films of all times, things get exciting...much more exciting than just quick fists and high kicks. If you look at the film through the prism of sexuality it is a MASTERPIECE!The film is about Oedipus complex!Both brothers (Billy and Julian) are sexually frustrated. Billy is a pedophile and it's probably caused by sexual relations with their mom (strong and imperious matron). Julian is an impotent (or is castrated) and his problem comes from the fact that he's lived in the shadow of his brother and his sexual games with their mom. He knows he can't have his mother that's why he kills his father (with bare hands) just to 'take his place' and he feels relief when Billy gets killed...the competition between brothers is over! The only time when Julian gets so close to his mother so he can penetrate her is when he cuts her guts with a sword...The only way he can penetrate her is by putting his hands inside her womb so he can physically be inside his mom and finally poses her! The question is: Who's the guy with a sword? He's an artist/aesthete (he sings and kills his victims in a very sophisticated way) who observes everything and takes his sexual pleasure by watching...he suffers from castration anxiety which refers to the fear of being degraded or dominated...that's why he cuts off parts of bodies of his enemies...His sword is just lengthening of his phallus :) Besides he might symbolize a father and ultimately God almighty, The sword man he's an angel of justice, he's like God (hence a father figure) as God is portrayed in the ancient testament, angry and vengeful, he's almighty and his sword is like his penis and his power, the cops with him are his apostles, the karaoke bits are like a strange Kind of Mass where he sings stuff like ""you'll never get out of here""",Only God Forgives
200,Abyss47,Refn refuses to rehash himself.,7,21 July 2013,"Already appearing to be one of the most polarizing films of the year, Only God Forgives will likely trigger debate for a long period of time. Nicolas Winding Refn brought a lot more attention to himself as a director after making Drive, one of 2011's most memorable films. People who otherwise wouldn't have given a damn about him started to take notice and anticipate whatever project he became attached to next. Only God Forgives triggered excitement early after some photo stills from on set found their way onto the internet. Ryan Gosling reuniting with Refn after Drive only added to the anticipation.The film has a plot, but it's not as important as the style and execution, which I automatically became attached to from the first frame to the last. You see, it's with this film where Refn seemed to be trolling his fans who fell in love with Drive. Instead of the straightforward approach that made Drive easy to follow, Only God Forgives gives a big ""F YOU"" to conventional ways of telling a story. I've heard some people describe the film's atmosphere as ""nightmarish"". Well, none of my nightmares have ever looked this good. ""Hellish"" is the term I would use to describe it, and even that isn't entirely doing justice to what Refn and cinematographer Larry Smith have accomplished here. The film's mood isn't entirely unlike that of another unusual film released this year - Spring Breakers - as they're both permeated by a quiet intensity that could make even the most fearless viewer squirm in their seats. The film has the look and feel of a frightening horror picture where evil lurks around the next corner and happiness is practically nonexistent.Using a variety of colors, from dark red (the primary color) to light blue to gold and yellow, as well as an effective use of shadows, which contrast well with said colors, the film looks utterly fantastic, delivering a visual experience that is reason enough to watch the film more than once. Refn's choice of shots is smart and sophisticated as well, going so far as to remind me of Kubrick, as extended shots of characters looking into the distance and at each other can be found throughout, but without taking away from the details of the scenery. Refn fully realizes the effect of quietness and how to maintain a consistent atmosphere that keeps the viewer in a paralyzed effect. I can just imagine what it must be like to see one of his films in a darkened theater; that anticipation of violence erupting at any moment can be felt with assuring affirmation.Ryan Gosling and the rest of the cast hold it all together like glue, with Gosling essentially playing a more mysterious version of his character in Drive, a drug smuggler by the name of Julian. Julian doesn't even react to the news of his brother's death, which draws attention from his mother Crystal (played splendidly by Kristin Scott Thomas) in one table scene that showcases Refn's eye for contrasting colors and flair for making the most out of an otherwise simple scene. Mai (Ratha Phongam), a prostitute involved with Julian, is merely a pawn in a nasty, cruel game of sadistic players looking to avenge the death of an immoral rapist/murderer. Chang (Thai police lieutenant), is a man that sees himself as immortal and without flaws. This God complex instills in him a level of confidence that helps fuel his inner rage. He's also the type of guy nobody would want to f-ck with, and Julian soon realizes this after he's beaten to a pulp in a one-on-one boxing match with Chang that damn near ends his life. It's almost as if Julian's mother has to convince Julian to continue his quest for vengeance since he's so emotionless and that fight seemed to take a lot out of him. Of course, him being told by his mother that Chang is out to get her after finding out that she ordered a hit on him also may have helped.This makes one singular moment at the end all the more unusual, as Julian commits an act of redemption that displays his humanity before giving up what I can imagine would be very important to any human being. Like with Tony Montana, the thought of killing a kid proves too much for him, and in the process of killing his ally Charlie and seeing the dead body of his mother, killed by Chang, comes to terms with the guilt of his lifestyle, and in a sequence that may or may not be real, surrenders his hands to Chang. The ending is a real piece of gold, as Chang returns to his harmless hobby of singing karaoke after committing such cruel, violent acts, and in the process, all seems to dwindle down in peace, as our anti-hero is nowhere to be found. Cliff Martinez's score further illuminates the despair and constant death that surrounds the environment the film takes place in. And it's kind of funny when you consider just how beautiful the whole thing looks. Dialogue isn't necessary in a film like this which has such a calculated and developed style. The feeling the style gave me is that of love, hate, confusion, warmth, coldness, fondness, intensity, and much, much more. When a film triggers so many different emotions in you over the course of less than two hours, you know it's done something right.Many people will hate this film and toss it to the side as something pointless and boring, but understanding that there's so many different ways in utilizing the language of film, and that not everything needs to be straightforward or accessible, this is a film that I easily took a liking to. It helps that I didn't expect Drive 2.0 and it also helps that I got exactly what I was looking for, a film driven purely by great, sophisticated, and refined style.",Only God Forgives
201,Baghdaddy,"Entertaining, But Incredibly Strange",4,13 February 2014,"OK to start with, this film was incredibly entertaining and I judge this by the fact that by the time the movie ended, I didn't realise as I was that gripped throughout. There was tonnes of action, and I do praise the actors for the way they portray their characters as it was incredible.This film, however, is not for me. The film is just too strange, with multiple things going on at once which made it hard to comprehend what was actually happening. It took me about 20 minutes to even pick up what the storyline was about!The main character, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, is well played but also confuses me, as he is incredibly quiet with not much background given to his silence. His brother, however, was brilliantly acted but his actual character managed to disturbed me despite him being only alive for the first 15 minutes. There is too much mindless violence, random flashbacks and alternative scenes in this movie for me to have been able to call it a good film. This is summed up in the end scene when the mother's body is discovered by the second son.",Only God Forgives
202,crom-dubh,"Unfairly maligned, interesting movie",8,2 June 2018,"I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece, but I do think that it manages to be an interesting film that seems to be hated by a lot of people. Looking at the ratings for this vs. The Neon Demon, I'm honestly surprised to see this one rated lower, as I consider it the more obviously superior. I think one reason for this is that this film followed ""Drive"" which (especially since both star Gosling) set the expectation that this would be more like that, whereas The Neon Demon follows this movie, which set the expectation that his films would be batsh** crazy artsy affairs, which both definitely are. The film has a very nice look, seemingly inspired by the look (or perhaps idea) of Thailand, and probably owing a bit of debt to Suspiria with its rich neon colors (especially red). The cinematography is excellent, and everything seems to be meticulously planned. I think the acting and story will be where this film either provokes love or hate in different viewers. Fans of David Lynch will probably be largely sympathetic to the style here: it has a lot of bizarre and unrealistic dialog that seems designed to instill an unsettling mood, and it mostly works. There are some cringe-inducing moments but overall I felt like it fits with the film. The story is mostly easy to follow but requires that the viewer do a bit of work to decipher the motivations of the characters, but this is really where the film gets interesting, so I think it makes sense that this requires more active participation from the viewer. Thematically, I find this film ten times more interesting than The Neon Demon and Drive. Why our protagonist is doing the things he is doing and why he ultimately ends up where he does are as important if not more so than the visual merits of the film. I have to wonder whether people criticizing it and saying it's all ""style over substance"" really understood some of the most basic aspects of the story. This is not a perfect film, and will be hard to watch for some, as it contains some fairly brutal violence. The strange combination of elements will leave some perplexed, but I think it's this rather inspired mix that sets it apart and warrants subsequent viewings. Of Refn's more heavily stylized films (of which I'd include this, The Neon Demon, and Valhalla Rising), this one is arguably his best, in my book.",Only God Forgives
203,zuhairvazir,I loved the innuendos and the neon,8,27 January 2014,"Every once in a while a film comes along that makes you want to watch it more than just once. The first time you pay attention to almost all things on-screen, after that it's just the film and plenty of visual stimulation. The good looking movie does not have an easy pattern to follow, with sequences of psychedelic sexual daydreaming, trying to catch up with a clairvoyant and ferocious cop and Gosling. I'm beginning to wonder if he is this quite in real-life too. His omnipresence, non-existent smile and his calm and quite demeanor have become a trademark for Gosling. I pray it doesn't become a problem when his character is given entire monologues. Not a problem for him - he can pull it off - but for the audience to digest.Kristin Scott Thomas is a delight to watch as Crystal, Daniel's (Gosling) vamp, drug dealer of a mom. There's a confrontational sequence between the two characters that imprints itself to the brain. Thomas is looking great, after a long time; since 'The English Patient (1996)'She plays her character to the tee, not flinching one bit as she hugs one of her boys around the waist, pressing herself to his crotch. 'Let me be your mother again.' She says. It creeps you out and gives you a glimpse inside the dark heart of Crystal.It is a difficult scene and both actors are at the top of their game in this one.The cop. Go figure him for yourself. A mythical, corrupt law enforcer who dispenses his enemies with pristine savagery, carrying a sense of self-righteousness and arrogance with him. He also has a lighter side; it made the heart smile.In all, this film not only packs some great punches but the whole deal comes out a winner.A must watch. Not to be missed by pot-heads under any circumstance.",Only God Forgives

""Only God Forgives"" was not well received upon it's premiere at the ""Cannes Film Festival"" this year and was greeted by walkouts and even booing during the end credits of the film. The question is, was this due to the high expectations set by Refn's previous film ""Drive"" which won the ""Best Director"" award at the festival in 2011? Or is this film really that bad? In the first few scenes of the film we are introduced to Julian, a drug smuggling foreigner and underground fight club owner living in Bangkok, thriving on the city's depravity. Julian is played by Ryan Golsing, who also starred in ""Drive"". This is Refn's second collaboration with him. We are also introduced to Julian's brother Billy a psychotic sex fiend, who walks the city streets at night looking for underage prostitute's. Billy gets into some serious trouble after he brutally rapes and murders an underage girl, with the permission of her father (not to murder). The police arrive at the scene, but these officers do not abide by the traditional rules of law enforcement. The group of policemen is lead by a retired cop named Chang, played by Vithaya Pansringarm. He is self appointed vigilante who calls himself ""The Angel of Death"". He lets the daughter's father brutally murder Billy, but does not exempt him from punishment. After Billy's death, the news quickly spreads to Julian and his mother, Crystal, played by Kristin Scott Thomas. She is the leader of a massive organized crime family located in the United States and upon hearing the news, she quickly flies to Bangkok to find and punish her sons killer in any means necessary. As the film progresses, extreme violence ensues and Julian's dark past begins to unravel.On a technical level ""Only God Forgives"" is a cinematic gem. The cinematography, soundtrack and production design are fantastic. Refn seems to have indulged in meticulous little details like the placement of objects and furniture as well as the lighting and sound design to create an atmospheric adventure. Unfortunately, if you haven't read the script prior to watching this film, it might be hard to become immersed in the story because of Refn's strange directorial decisions. For example, the film might be going along smoothly and then suddenly be interrupted by a strange, dreamlike vision experienced by the main character. Or the dialogue could become inaudible for a few good seconds. The film tries to do so much and to a certain degree is too ambitious. It tries to be a thrilling action film and at the same time an intellectual art house experience. Refn did this well with his two previous film, but totally missed the mark with ""Only God Forgives"". It is too unfocused and fails to satisfy equally on all fronts, therefore it also fails at being a well rounded film. I understand that he has probably intended for the action and violence to be presented in a poetic light, but being someone who thoroughly enjoyed the screenplay, I was a tad bit disappointed. Personally, I think the film would have worked much better if Refn had stuck to the original script. The acting is solid, there is not much dialogue from anyone apart from Kristin Scott Thomas, who is probably the best part of the entire film, playing a poisonous, domineering mother. Ryan Gosling is doing the ""silent psychopath"" routine again, which the director seems to love. Nevertheless, Gosling works well with what he is given, which isn't really a lot. Vithaya Pansringarm delivers a solid performance as well, but also hasn't got very much to work with and is overshadowed by the film's stylistic aspects. People have complained about the excessive violence in the film, but in many instances the actual violence is not shown on screen, rather the outcome of the violence, which to be fair can be just as gruesome and I wouldn't recommend this film for the weak of heart.Nicolas Winding Refn's gruesome, nightmarish thriller does not match up with the high standards set by his two previous films, ""Bronson"" and ""Drive"", but it is most definitely an interesting cinematic experience. Packed with impressive visuals, which is no surprise from a great visual director like this, ""Only God Forgives"" is undoubtedly a treat for the eyes. Unfortunately, the main problem with the film is that it feels alienated from it's audience and totally unfocused, it is clear that Refn made this film purely for himself rather than for his fans. However, there are many fascinating underlying themes in this film that undoubtedly require multiple viewings to discover and understand, therefore I will be doing a sort of retrospective on the film in a few weeks time when I will have analyzed it. The actors work with what they are given, which is not very much, apart from Kristin Scott Thomas who is just great in her role. ""Only God Forgives"" is most definitely not for everyone, I will definitely watch it again and I'm glad I saw it",Only God Forgives
205,Chrid-909,Emptiness dressed up as art,1,3 January 2015,"We turned this movie off after the first twenty minutes.Why? Because we knew that nothing good was going to happen in it and it could only get nastier.The next day I skimmed through the DVD to see what would happen and saw, as many reviewers have pointed out, long 'pretty' scenes where almost nothing happens interspersed with scenes of violence and torture.What is wrong with our world nowadays? Why all this disgusting sadism?You can read hundreds of reviews of this movie. Of course, just like with all movies, some like it, some don't. But of the ones who don't, it is not the violence that upsets them but the too long scenes where nothing happens and the fact that Ryan doesn't change his physical expression! How did we become so 'cool' with violence? Why don't we react any more? In the old days there were censors whose job it was to keep the worst sadism and violence off of the screen. But that's all gone out of the window.Now it's OK to dream up the most disgusting ideas and then be allowed, financed, encouraged even, to put them on screen. And serious actors and film crews, who ought to know better, involve themselves in this tripe and even get paid for it.The reviewers who like this movie see it as 'art'.I am very sorry but in my opinion art should be something that inspires us, that uplifts us. Sure, some art is there to make us think. We sometimes have to show the evil done by people in order to avoid it in the future (for example documentaries about man's inhumanity to man).But what about cinema? Is it art or is it entertainment? Can it be both? Answer: yes! And that is what the great films are and why they remain appreciated and keep being watched. The great films catch us and fascinate us and keep us wanting to see what happens next. Just as the great plays or novels do, because they tell a GOOD STORY. In a good story, there is at least one person with whom we sympathise or identify. His/her story is somehow also OURS. If the novel is also written with wonderful words then we enjoy it all the more and it gets to become a classic.The same with film. If there is a good story (and interestingly many great films have been made from unexceptional short stories or novellas) then it can be raised up by a great combination of direction and cinematography and acting to being 'art' to being 'classic'.People say nowadays: ""We don't need to be able to identify with the protagonist in a movie. We don't need heroes any longer. It's good to show 'life' as it really is. There are no heroes, only different shades of good and bad."" I disagree. We still need heroes in literature and in the cinema. We still, perhaps more than ever, need heroes who set an example, who work for peace or fight against injustice. For what will happen in this world if we all give up and say there is evil in us so let us just indulge in it? The world will then descend into a primordial nightmare of savagery and chaos.Is the character Julian in this movie someone with whom we wish to identify? Is there ANYONE in this movie with whom we can identify? If we can't identify with anyone then we don't care what happens to them, if they live or die... This was my problem with the so-lauded Kill Bill movies.A retribution movie is only good if you can identify with the victim's striving to avenge the terrible wrongs done to him/her. If the victim is also guilty of horrible crimes then there is no sense of injustice. They are only getting the same as they themselves have dealt out to others so who cares what happens to them? Some of the greatest films in history have moments of violence. They need to be there because they are essential to the story. They should not be there merely to give people the opportunity to witness acts of gross sadism and torture.Too many movies are like this nowadays. They give nothing. They are not uplifting or inspiring or even tell a damn good story. They tell empty stories of empty joyless people, and try to dress these stories up with 'cool' settings and artful lighting, and try to add excitement by throwing in dollops of violence... And how do stories like this leave you feeling? That's right... empty.",Only God Forgives
206,submitme,"Boring, no substance, nothing much",2,4 August 2020,"The cinematography is good and the style might be alright and reminds me a bit of ""Drive"" also with Gosling.But this movie has nothing else. No acting, because half the movie is wierd flashback like scenes, no one hardly says anything throughout the movie. There are endless shot where the camera just pans around for ages.
And again no one says anything or moves around.
It's basically just one long collection of still photos put into a dias show or a silent film.The storyline and reason behind the movie is horrible.
There are only a few scenes in the movie that got me going a bit other than that a drawn out and boring experience.
Even though the movie is actually shorter than average it just was something I just wanted to speed up. So if they cut down on the panning shots and long silent moments the movie would be under 1 hour long.I will give it 2 stars, only because I thought it had a few moments. But so much other stuff along the way that was just plain bad, that I can't give it any more.",Only God Forgives
207,jonathancolley-885-704860,Not easy viewing but thought provoking.,8,31 December 2013,"It'd difficult to know what to say about this movie.As previous reviewers have stated before, this is nothing to do with Drive so do not expect any connections beyond production.Very little is said during the movie, very little needs to be said as the ambiance presents beautifully the unfolding drama and the soundtrack keeps the pace moving which is an odd thing to say but I think any other score would have been detrimental, in some senses it feels almost like Manga...None of the lead characters portrayed are likable which makes viewing more palatable as there are some fairly horrific scenes, but it's reasonable to say that everyone gets what they deserve.So don't watch it with your girlfriend cos it's a Ryan Gosling movie, she won't appreciate it and don't watch it with a bunch of mates boozed up expecting an action movie as you'll be confused and bored but do watch it with a group of open minded friends who may already be interested in world cinema because that is almost what this is.",Only God Forgives

209,westside-surfer,Oscar material,10,6 January 2015,"Only God Forgives is one of the best neo-noir films ever made. For a long time Sin City wore the crown for the genre. But compared to Only God Forgives, Sin City appears corny and mostly for kids.The visuals grab you from the very beginning. It has a totally original style that's beautiful and mysterious. The director isn't afraid to dwell in the moment, establishing the thick Bangkok atmosphere. Long stretches of silence heighten the tension before it explodes in moments of extreme violence. The acting is amazing enough to require only a few lines of dialogue. It's really disappointing that the IMDb community has underrated this film. Most of the negative reviewers are complaining that it doesn't have enough action. Don't people get tired of watching the countless predictable shot-em-up gangster movies? OFG is being punished for having originality. Maybe people were turned off by foreign actors that--for once--didn't play the role of noble savages like so many ""magical negroes.""I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Taxi Driver or classic noir films. Also, the director dedicated this to the experimental film director Alejandro Jodorowsky, which tells you this movie has a psychedelic element. In the end OFG will divide audiences: on side side there's people who demand substance and innovation. On the other side are people who can't wait for the next Expendables movie.",Only God Forgives

A couple of my friends are actors in the movie, and a couple more were involved in casting, and they had their names on the screen. That's the good news. Here's the bad. This movie is slow, it drags, it's an absolute cheerless production. People don't just look at each other. They stare. Endlessly. Everyone stares. Endlessly. People stumble along, similar to zombie movies in the 70s. This movie is 100 minutes long, and it could have been 80 minutes if people cut their stares to glances, and if they would walk at normal speeds. Before I saw the movie, I read the reviews, and looked forward to a bracing revenge movie. Instead, I saw a troubling remake of ""Eraserhead"".",Only God Forgives
212,miesnekawalki,Hollow art,2,23 May 2015,"This movie is interesting when pure cinematography is involved. Interesting shots, insane color palette, stuff like that. And that's why it gets 2 instead of solid 1 from me.This is supposed to be a revenge story. But in order to have successful revenge you have to introduce proper characters, with their motivations, hate between each others, some reasons to cheer for them or dislike them. This movie has nothing from it. There are no characters, everything is put in this movie to fit artsy vision of Refn. There are no people, everybody is a dummy, standing or walking around with a snail pace going whoever knows where and what for. There are no interesting dialogues either. Hell, every 'character' of this movie tells about 2 short sentences throughout the entire duration of this unholy mess...This movie is violent. But this violence has no purpose whatsoever! It's like terribly boring 20 minutes of people standing around, then a guy cutting other guy's chest in half with the katana, then 20 minutes of people walking around and then the same guy pulling out another guys eyeballs with some blade.Painfully slow pacing, no characters, story or real script, joyless world, unnecessary violence - all of that creates a bubbly mess that cinema students must see. To know how to NOT make a movie...And the cherry on top - you know that you watch terrible movie when people in the cinema look genuinely angry after watching it. The reaction of the crowd (something like 'what the actual f*** was that?!') stopped me from getting a refund for a ticket :)",Only God Forgives
213,beetleborgs69,Modest charm with a subtle freeform ecstatic edge,8,20 December 2013,"When you see a film like ""Only God Forgives"" it makes you think about what a strange thing it is that you're even watching a movie. The elongated meditation on tropes. The meticulous production. If you relax, the silent rape leads to multiple climaxes. If you wonder what it's for in the end that can be a game for you. Objectively it's interesting cinema. ""Drive"" was a weird movie, frivolous and intentionally rewarding through the narrative. I guess I liked that movie, or was effectively played by it's action pieces and to some extent their context. I felt the same way about this movie. The director, probably in good conscious, opiated the play. It makes it hit broader, maybe harder, maybe larger. It's certainly funny when it lashes out. Funnier than ""Bronson"". It's awkwardness is a clever sincerity and works it's charm, an innocence to the execution that stands out brilliant over all the extremities.",Only God Forgives
214,SushiStoner103,Critics Bashed this Movie To The Ground I Understand Why,7,1 December 2014,"Only god forgives is a very mysterious movie containing unresolved metaphors and silence throughout but I like to think that this movie is so powerful it speaks for itself. I can assure you this is not a straight forward film, and this is why I enjoyed it. The film has a captivating score and jaw dropping cinematography, this creates a memorable atmosphere and beautiful visuals. This film is a strange and obscure interpretation of vengeance very similar to Nicolas Winding Refn's previous films, and that is where the critics have gone wrong and the audience to an extent. Because they were expecting some sequel to drive. Of course the film has flaws, there was limited character development on Ryan Gosling's character's (Julian) behalf this results to no emotional attachment to the character. There were also scenes where the film took violence to the next level which I felt were overdone and unnecessary but putting all that aside I would strongly recommend a second viewing to analyze and recognize the appreciation this work of art deserves.",Only God Forgives
215,sleons,Sadly underrated,10,29 July 2013,"This movie suffers the same sad situation as Spring Breakers. The fact that Ryan Gosling stars in it makes audiences believe their in for a conventional blockbuster.The film is very contemplative and slow paced. It is stylish and complex, yet the story manages to be extremely simple. I think OGF is a very modern film, and in a way it's one of those movies that inherits a lot from Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void. It has a lot of similarities with Noe's film, Bangkok is a city with fantastic aesthetics to tell this tale (as Tokyo has the psychedelic feel Noe needed for ETV). The cinematography and Production Design work hand in hand with the director to create one of the most visually stunning films you will ever see. Nicolas Winding Refn is one of the active directors to follow. From what I've seen all his movies guarantee a unique voice. That's what makes a filmmaker stand out from the rest, developing a style.",Only God Forgives
216,sepial,Sheer brilliance.,10,29 July 2013,"With some films it's a given that they'll divide. That is by no means a safe indicator for quality, or even anything interesting in general. In the specific case Nicholas Winding Refn it is, though. The division in regards to 'Only God Forgives' isn't created by the much discussed violence, thankfully. It's generated by the director's uncompromising demands for what this film had to be and how it had to look like. It's pace, it's contrasts, the reduced acting, arriving at aesthetics that are at once hypnotic and uncomfortable. It is very hard not to think of 'Lynchian', and not wrong - it's in the music as well -, but it is a 'Lynchian' Refn would have created even if Lynch hadn't ever made any films. There's a sense of constant threat running through the film as a red line, and one of peculiar melancholy. The heart of it, both character-wise and, to me, in terms of acting is Vithaya Pansringarm's Chang. There can't be a better example for the effect of understatement, of presence and over-the-whole-film looming than Pansringarm's play, creating a most compelling persona beyond good and evil with the most minute gestures and incredible clarity. There's a need to mention the music, without which the film would have been another, which is how it goes with successful marriages between score and image, and it is one of my favourite works of Martinez to date. It's not the easiest of ways to spend a film's length evening, which, in this case, speaks for it already; I spent the 90 minutes transfixed, and the film propelled its director to the top of my most wanted (to watch) list.",Only God Forgives
217,farron34,Interesting,9,2 August 2013,"This film has received a lot of bad press, but after watching it, I feel like it's simply misunderstood. It is very slowly paced, with long static shots, and very little dialogue (Gosling has 22 lines). It is very violent and dark but the story itself is told using vivid metaphors. Cinematically, I thought it was shot very well. I loved the dark tones, rich colors and chiaroscuro lighting. I thought the characters were interesting, and the acting was well done. Shot entirely on location in Thailand, it shows quite a bit of the Thai culture. Very graphic, yet the it was done in a way to almost be contemplative and purposeful. Definitely not for everyone, but an interesting film.",Only God Forgives
218,MalcolmJTaylor,"Evocative and beautiful, brave choices, a work to be applauded",6,21 July 2013,"Only God Forgives is a great art film with lots of cool over-the-top, bordering on the absurd to the point of comical, and also at times, gruesome violence. It has a terrific and mesmerizing soundtrack. It also boasts some haunting and evocative cinematography and creative editing choices. It looks beautiful. The cinematography is Kubrick-esque in its formalism and haunting in its use of colour, and low light as well as its bold compositions. This film, at parts, is very entertaining. It is bold in its dialogue and character choices. Kristin Scott Thomas practically walks away with this film, chewing up the scenery with the gravitas she brings to her Oedipal complex-ed underworld mother. Comparing the size of her sons endowments is a jaw dropper that stretches credibility, yet somehow fits into the dream scape of this film. Spewing out lines like, ""I'm sure you entertain a lot of (male members) with that (seminal fluid) bucket,"" has to be one of the best lines heard in any film! I love the frank sexuality laced into this film. It feels refreshing. Performance wise though, the real revelation here is the Asian actor Vithaya Pansringarm, who plays Police lieutenant Chang. Wow, what a performance! Such gripping stillness, coupled with his deft and brutal martial arts and sword work. Not to mention his show-stealing Karaoke prowess! It's awesome. I loved that he kicks the s*** of Gosling's character with a minimal amount of moves, decimating him to a bloody pulp on the floor of his own gym in a matter of a few lethal moves. Something you would never see in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Actually, most of everything in this film is something you would never see in any mainstream Hollywood movie. That is definitely why I like it so much. And it's also why I'm so proud of the actors and filmmakers involved in this project for putting something brave, truthful and unique on screen. Bravo!I have a real soft spot for this film, which lets me forgive its obvious lack of a strong narrative, plot or much tension. I viewed it as a very credible exercise in formalism as a film making aesthetic, and on those grounds it is highly successful. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it's just kind of out to have a little fun. And I quite enjoyed it. Even so, the film over all doesn't quite add up to a sum of all its parts and leaves the viewer wanting something more. Or, at least, the feeling of having missed something greater lingers as you walk out of the cinema. However, its many triumphs overshadow this fact, since in the end it did not set out to provide gripping narrative. It succeeds in evoking a dream scape and an underworld, which I saw as a portal to one's subconscious, where, truly there is no narrative. Just a constant sense of falling of a cliff. Which this film more or less achieves with its cinematic incantations. One of the final images of Gosling's character invading his dead mother's corpse has to be one of the most intensely personal, erotic and truly Freudian moments ever put on screen. I highly recommend checking it out. Preferably in a cinema if you can. Not sure how well its studied nature and atmosphere will hold up on home theatre viewing. Great soundtrack. Great performances. Incredible cinematography. Brave choices. A work to be applauded.",Only God Forgives
219,sinatrakennedy,Art House PERFECTION - fresh and creative,10,20 June 2013,"I was lucky enough to see ONLY GOD FORGIVES last night at the US premiere here in Austin Texas at the Alamo Draft House. Director Nicolas Winding Refn and score creator Cliff Martinez attended the showing and stayed afterwards for a question session. The experience was amazing. Now for my opinion on the movie. A movie that people/critics walked out on at Cannes. ONLY GOD FORGIVES is a beautiful journey into hell. Like Dante's Inferno, it takes us spiraling down into the darkest depths. The use of red lights accompanied by Cliff Martinez's hypnotic score, transports us to a world that may only exist in the darkest corners of our mind. A world of jealousy, resentment and pornographic violence. A world that seems to have several devils in it, surrounded by demons. This world exists only to serve a smothering sexual predator of a mother and her two uniquely different but disturbed boys. This is a sensory overload film and very ""lynchian"". I was reminded of David Lynch in that its the silence that commands all the power. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as the films only conscience. Conflicted and lost, his soul drifts through the film like a ghost. Kristin Scott Thomas is almost unrecognizable as the wicked mother. She is depraved and easily the main ""Devil"" of the story. Her performance is outstanding. Vithaya Pansringarm (the angel of death) is numbingly awesome as the films only sane (but brutal) character. His quiet strength and stoic manner would have stole the film if he wasn't surrounded by Ryan and Kristen. He is amazing and exudes charisma. The Cinematography by Larry Smith is creepy and exactly what the film needs to pull you in. Cliff Martinez yet again, creates a score that is as much a character in the film as any of its actors. Visually, this is one of my favorite films of all time. This is not a mainstream movie. It is not for the faint at heart. This is art house cinema at its best. Your average 2 second TV commercial has more dialogue. So what's it about? I prefer to let the master, David Lynch answer that: ""It makes me uncomfortable to talk about meanings and things. It's better not to know so much about what things mean. Because the meaning, it's a very personal thing, and the meaning for me is different than the meaning for somebody else."" - David Lynch That's art for you... I must add one last note to all the brain dead pop culture people that gave this film a poor rating and said that it was boring: I feel sorry for you... Because your so caught up in your bubblegum culture that you can't even enjoy true art when you see it. You need everything spelled out for you. These are also the types that ""talk"" and ""text"" during the movie. Abstract art is obviously beyond such closed minded people's grasp. It's these types of people and that type of mentality that led to Mozart dying in poverty and buried in an unmarked grave. My highest rating of FIVE STARS.",Only God Forgives

When I heard it was horrible and was getting bad reviews I got even more excited.You see in America 27 million people eat at McDonald's every day. Half of all American drink soda pop everyday. The best selling hits and album are the ones with the lowest musical quality. Same thing with books, the triter, more clichéd, and idiotic; the better it sells.Based on these fact, I pretty much know that if a movie contains anything but the most obvious and clichéd storytelling, the most boring and simple cinematography, and the rest of the gimmicks to fool the tooled masses, it will be berated.I thoroughly enjoy this movie from the first second to the last. It does contain ultrviolence which I don't mind. The whole surreal imaging is less about being realistic and more about expression and stylizing the iconic ideas. I can see the direct connection here with another great Refn movie Valhalla Rising.If you are a tool, if you could sit through Transformers, Fast and Retarded, or watch kids movies; you will not like this.

His film of revenge, deprived of all characters between speculation and told showing even less essential, is a whirlwind of murders with the clutter of a logical link between them , in which the most important deities in the field ( Asian cinema and western) are retrieved from the choice of noise is that of the drawn swords of gun shots , a series of sounds that do not belong to the library of intellectual cinema but more to those kinds of hyperbolic . Only God forgives so is the final odyssey of a man who chose the Thai boxing as a childhood does not work after a simple and murder on his shoulders, a child is not suitable for the family business which is having to get the ends of the violent world in which he lives to try , despite himself, to where it is able to go , finding an unexpected closed.

Unfortunately not always visual search is at the level of legitimate expectations nor the idea of being able to paint the purity (for better or for worse) of violence can really materialize . Refn knows how to bring to the screen image for a formal perfection and communicative impressive (the power of the former policeman summed up in the uniformed colleagues who follow him constantly as bodyguards but dumb and unexpected reconciliation kindergarten through immersion in the flesh of a laceration in the belly) but this time the impression is that it is not enough.",Only God Forgives

223,jesse-hitzroth,Want to fight?,6,27 July 2013,"Only God Forgives has been the movie i have been most looking forward to see so far this year. I was shocked to hear such criticism and debate about this film. It seemed like many were split on this movie either being great or a disaster. Of coarse this film will also be compared to the amazing film 'Drive'. So how does Only God Forgive compare to Refn's 'Drive'? Only God Forgives falls right in the middle. It's not an awful film but it's not all that great either. The problems lie in that there is little to no story and the film is too long and too slow. The film is beautiful to look at and very engaging and there are tons of great metaphors and read between the line moments about the god and the devil. However this film is just crushed underneath it's own weight. It's too slow and not engaging enough. Refn makes films not movies and he is clearly a talented director and he made my favourite film of last year 'drive'. Here though he seems to falter. Lots of ideas work but lots of ideas are also a mess. Many critics who panned this movie also talked about how extreme the violence is. I can easily say the violence here is really not that bad. Graphic yes, but no where near the level of violence in 'drive'. It's an easy film to hate, but really it's just disappointing cause there was so much potential here to be better. It's worth checking out, but only if you like Refn's past work. Hopefully his next project can take a few more steps forward next time around. Rating: 6 out of 10",Only God Forgives
224,ysstog,Garbage,1,19 July 2013,"I like slow films. I like contemplative films. I like all of Refn's other films, but this movie is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. I nodded off twice at a noon screening. This film is so boring that people in the theater started having conversations--not about the film. I usually shush these people or walk over and intimidate them till they shut the hell up. However, while watching Only God Forgives, I instead found myself more interested in what these strangers were talking about than I was with the film.I don't think the film's too slow. I don't think the film's too violent. (Audience members burst out laughing at more than one violent moment in the movie.) I just think it's boring, pretty much beginning to end. I thought one line of dialogue was memorable and what little dialogue there was, otherwise, was poorly written and delivered. I had no idea who Kristin Scott Thomas was walking into the film but she was *terrible* in this--I can only assume she thought the dialogue was so ludicrous that she figured if it was delivered poorly they would have to cut it out. She had no such luck. Avoid this movie at all costs. Hell, avoid it for free. Gonna see it anyway? Bring a good book.",Only God Forgives
225,m-sendey,It is undoubtedly an art-house which has to be approached on its own terms,8,22 August 2013,"Julian (Ryan Gosling), a drug smuggler utilising his boxing club as a cover for his criminal actions, is to avenge his brother Billy (Tom Burke) who raped and murdered a sixteen-year-old prostitute. Once he gets to know the truth about the occurrence better, he allows the killer to go. Upon getting to know this, Julian's mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) is not exactly overjoyed and constrains Julian to fulfil his duty and get rid of people involved in Billy's murderous demise This unflinchingly savage successor of Drive is about as action-packed as Limits of Control by Jarmusch and though it implicates a big portion of gore, it is undoubtedly an art-house which has to be approached on its own terms. The surreal and oneiric imagery of this motion picture will put off many audiences which are likely to find this neon-lit, dream-like, bitter candy obnoxiously soporific. Those who are fond of Lynch, Jodorowsky or Suzuki's films might give this one a shot or two. Owing to its sparse story and disorientating editing, it reminds a less action-oriented Suzuki gangster pic in which the plot plays the secondary role and the visuals are the most significant element. Whilst Drive was more about aesthetics and infusing European sensibility into American pulp material, Only God Forgives focuses on depicting intrinsic depravity of human souls in the chilly, criminal environment of Bangkok. A large section of the flick consists of Julian's hallucinations which each viewer has to interpret on his or her own by encroaching into this otherworldly, infernal world which enthralls and shocks. To my way of thinking, the portentous visions of Julian portray his inner fears and unwillingness towards avenging his brother as his male's duty. The entire penetration of Julian's spirit might be deemed as a battle between his feminine and masculine impulses, clashing and perplexing his mental state. Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) – Julian's regular prostitute might be regarded as a symbol of his sensitivity, female emotions, while Crystal and Billy as his male determinants. Julian vacillates between abandoning the mission and following the lane of man, even if it signifies to contend with the God embodied by Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm). It is not perfectly lucid whether Chang is a man who considers himself to be some sort of infinity or he is de facto the God, but it seems better to state that he is merely a man responsible for justice whose behaviour is quasi-bionic. As regards two leading females, Crystal and Mai are two contradictory forces combating within Julian's soul which ultimately succumbs to his mother's desires and trots on the path of masculinity. Evidently, it is solely one of possible exegeses. Refn confounds the composition of the movie, by inserting Julian's dreams and endowing the ensemble with sequences of extreme brutality, surrealism, oneirism, interweaving with sporadic tracking shots and disorientating angles, which prompt textural embroilment and abstruseness. Notwithstanding, it does not fully succeed even on Refn's or art-house's standards forasmuch the material appears to be exorbitantly reliant on beautiful cinematography and sumptuous visuals and the instant they do not impose that much, Only God Forgives embarks on being slightly humdrum, somnolent, insufficient and it intermittently ceases to be impressive in compounding the sensation of viewer's alienation.Contrary to popular belief, I firmly believe that the acting is quite satisfying, despite being frugal. It is a dream-like fable transpiring in a different reality, hence one ought to expect something entirely different. I find Gosling's minimalistic demeanour towards his role very gripping and he infrequently displays some emotions, mostly during Julian's visions. Nevertheless, it is Kristin Scott Thomas who steals the show as the diabolical Crystal. She is very convincing as the mother of Julian and once she utters something, she makes viewer's blood curdle and her unabashedly vulgar behaviour is cringe-inducing. Other actors likewise provide us with sparing performances and the chemistry between Kristin Scott Thomas and Ryan Gosling is the most galvanising ingredient.The cinematography of Larry Smith is absolutely captivating and with its feral outbursts of red and yellow tints, it constitutes a ravishing chiaroscuro décor. It is one of the greatest merits of Refn's pic which benefits from this subsidiary aspect very much. The camera captures the diabolic beauty of Refn's Bangkok and rather remains staid, with some occasional motions, e.g. just before the duel between Julian and Chang whose manner of filming a bit resembles the final fight from Seijun Suzuki's Tattooed Life (1965). The soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is enchantingly lugubrious. He supplies an absolutely delightful piece of music which flawlessly contextualises with brutal events by reverberating organ riffs and electronic scores.Filled with blood, pain, opaqueness and bizarreness, Only God Forgives will not appeal to the majority of mainstream film buffs, but some cinephiles will appreciate Refn's stylisation, elaborate sets and engaging manner of exposing internal world of the putrid characters. Nonetheless, Only God Forgives fails and never accomplishes what it is after, owing to its repetitiveness as well as psychologically remote and unlikable characters. I am glad that Refn resolved to execute a film like this and not to fully relinquish his artistic freedom for sake of receiving bigger budgets and pursuing grand commercial successes. His cinema is exigent, atypical, outré and uncannily unique. Drive was solely a mainstream divergence from his genuine interests which are far from being tangible and easily marketable to contemporaneous audiences. I just hope that he will render his next motion picture more an opus of skilled craftsmanship than a whimsical and experimental creation of his imagination which is deconstructed to the extension that it virtually feels like a tableau vivant and becomes insufficiently fertile to constitute a strong motion picture.",Only God Forgives
226,theordinaryreview,"In all, the film is a major let down, where the good actors simply don't act, the story is cliché and the dialogues are entirely dull or rendered inaudible.",2,23 July 2013,"Billy: ""Time to meet the devil.""The movie starts with Julian hanging out at a boxing club. After a fight, Julian meets with two others and we learn that one of them, Billy is his brother. We learn that they run a drug trade in Bangkok. Shortly after, Billy goes on a spree and starts engaging in erratic and violent behavior at different sex clubs. Later that night, the police arrive in one hotel and find Billy next to a prostitute that he raped and killed. The police however don't arrest Billy, and the head of the police decides to bring the father of the young underage, now dead, prostitute and leave the murderer and the father of the victim alone in the room. What is quite predictable happens and now Julian has to redeem his brother's death.The film begins well, with some clever use of shadows and lighting. We are quickly put in the mold for the heavily violent atmosphere of brothels and drug smuggling. However this will remain the best component of the movie and nothing else delivers. The slow introduction to this rude and crude world never picks up on the pace and we are left watching everything in slow motion. If there is a fight or a kill that will happen, you've seen it unfold ten times in your head before it actually starts. And the dramatic music can't sustain such a build up for so long.Of the main characters, Julian and his mother are both despicable and the audience can not possibly root for either one. Their acting consists mostly of blank stares and the rare lines that they speak are totally vain or trash talks from the mother who apparently flirts shamelessly with Julian, even though she vastly preferred Billy. The cop could have been an interesting character but that story line doesn't go anywhere either. Nevertheless, we do find out he is quite knowledgeable in the art of killing and torturing people.The gore is not too bad but in a slow film like this it actually doesn't do much. The pace just doesn't fit the gore. The symbolism is pretty loaded but it is never certain whether something is imagined, dreamed or lived. This ends up making the film look like a collection of psychological clichés of a wide range, from the oedipal mother-son relationship to the recurring symbol of guilt--incessant hand washing-- and other violent behaviors.While I had initially liked the setting in Thailand, sadly, it is only further dwells into more clichés. I don't think I've ever seen a Western movie set in Thailand without dealing with prostitution (of minors). It is as though they feel Thailand has nothing other than that to offer to movies.In all, the film is a major let down, where the good actors simply don't act, the story is cliché and the dialogues are entirely dull or rendered inaudible. The good aspects of a nice photography and shots are ruined by the extensive use of slow motion and build ups. It didn't manage to grasp my attention long enough to prevent me from wondering whether I really liked Drive or whether the good music and Ryan Gosling's presence had compensated for everything else.I liked: Looks good if you fast forward. Thailand.I disliked: Useless dialogues (""want to fight?""). Abusing two cool effects (red shadows and slow motion) doesn't make a good movie. Symbolic for shock value.23/100 I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Maybe if you want to laugh gather a few friends and watch this in shuffle.Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com",Only God Forgives

228,MisterE2108,Masterful film making,10,22 July 2013,"My eyes could not look away, the splendor of color, music, scenery were simply magnificent. The Set design was a feast of rich bold ambiance the likes I haven't seen in a film as such in a very long time. Director Nicolas Winding Refn (Valhalla Rising, Drive) takes us on a surreal journey of murder, revenge and violence, I'm fast becoming a big fan of his work. One of the major surprises for me was Kristin Scott Thomas, who plays 'Crystal'. I'll go so far to call her character, a drug Queenpin. Crystal a crime boss and mother of two sons (Ryan Gosling, Tom Burke) who share in her world of drugs and death. Kristin was wickedly beautiful in this film, I've never seen her in such a way and I found myself wanting to know or see more of her character in a back story or a stand alone film. Another major surprise for me was the performance by Vithaya Pansringarm who plays 'Chang'. Chang was no joke and was as ruthless as they comes, but didn't have the look or demeanor of sinister, violent man. Chang was a bad bad man. It lead me to believe that once you seen and understood who Chang was, you wanted no parts of him. And the fact that he was a cop, made his presence all the more frightening. I'm really trying to share my take on this film without any spoilers but for a film like this, it's hard to do. Tom Burke (Billy) is a sick demented person who likes having sex with young girls, the illegal kind, along with his lustful despicable sexual nature, he throws in extreme violence. In this case Billy's actions cause the horrific death of a 17yr old prostitute. Who's father is allowed to exact his revenge on Billy by...Chang, who then after the father violently obliterates Billy, Chang severely punishes the father for letting the young daughter get involved in prostitution, by hacking off one of his arms?! Revenge is a plenty in this film, and yes the film does have some extremely violent scenes. Ryan Gosling fans may not like this version of him, but trust me when I say this, Gosling is on the verge of because one of the great American actors, 'Only God Forgives' proves this. With all that said, 'Only God Forgives' is an amazing film...on the level of Masterful film making, from top to bottom, I give this film a 10.",Only God Forgives
229,Ser_Stephen_Seaworth,"If ""Drive"" was heaven, ""Only God Forgives"" is Dante's hell.",10,19 July 2013,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. Nicolas Winding Refn's latest film, Only God Forgives, could conceivably be called the closest thing to a true take on Dante's Divine Comedy we've had in cinema. And it's easy to see why the film has divided audiences so greatly. The Danish auteur has followed up his most critically successful project with what may very well be his most divisive. Some have called it a hellish masterpiece, others have called it a loathsome exercise in style. Make no mistake: Only God Forgives is not an easy watch. That seems to be Refn's bailiwick, as the director seems to enjoy making his audiences squirm (remember the elevator headstomp in Drive, or the sheer brutality of Valhalla Rising?). And he only cranks the dial up to eleven with this one. And for all of those expecting a pseudo-sequel to Drive, let me dissuade you: this is a completely different beast. Despite the two films sharing a laconic leading man in Ryan Gosling, Only God Forgives is Drive's polar opposite (or perhaps ""evil twin"" is more appropriate). Whereas Drive felt like a synthpop-infused dream, Refn's latest is a neon-splashed slice of hell. Hell seems to be where Julian (Gosling) has been banished, and Refn's hell is Bangkok, a vibrant metropolis that is both beautiful and terrible to behold. Julian is the younger scion of a criminal matriarchy who spends his days running a kickboxing dojo. His older brother, Billy (Luke Evans), opts to use Bangkok to exercise his inner depravity. He ends up raping and murdering a teenage girl one night, and when the cops find him in the blood-drenched room, they contact their boss, a stone-faced cop named Lieutenant Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm). Chang allows the girl's father to exact revenge by beating Billy to death with his bare fists . . . and in return, Chang takes the father's hand with his trademark sword, then subsequently detoxes by performing pop songs in a karaoke bar. Billy's death and Julian's seeming indifference brings about the attention of their mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), who flies from America to claim her firstborn's corpse--and in doing so, emasculating her second son and forcing him to exact vengeance. Every party in this film cuts a swath of violence until its ultimate bloody climax, and Refn does not shy away from the brutal goings-on. We are treated to viscera-slathered rooms, split ribcages poking from gaping slash wounds . . . and in one grueling instance, a ruptured pair of eyeballs. Yet it isn't the brutality that is most discomforting--or, indeed, exhilarating--about Only God Forgives. It is the crushing weight and the oppressive threat of violence that hangs over every gorgeous frame of the film, the brooding feeling that had made Valhalla Rising such a wonderful (if alienating) experience. Refn's film isn't a meditation of violence like that, but rather showcasing how, in a lawless world, every man might turn savage. Even the righteous in this world deal their justice in blood. Always the master of atmosphere, Refn's brought top talent to the table. Cliff Martinez's score is ruthlessly energetic, a droning cacophony of horror that would make Wendy Carlos proud. His ace cinematographer Larry Smith, who lensed Bronson and Valhalla Rising, creates a horrifyingly enchanting look at sin and death and divine torment, soaking every frame in bloods and neons. I have long said that Refn is the perfect man to direct Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy's nightmarish Western, and this continues to validate it. Whether or not you like him (and there are many who don't), you can't deny that Refn is ambitious, and for making a film with such a scant budget, he made every cent count. However, if I had to fault the film for anything, it's the fact that he took a very solid script and pared it down to its core elements. ""Show, don't tell"" is the golden rule of filmmaking, and Refn has taken that to heart. There is very little dialogue in the film that isn't in Thai, and most of what's left is condensed to terse one-sentence phrases. But Refn, like his mentor Alejandro Jodorowsky (to whom the film is dedicated), fuels this red-bathed nightmare with a slow dread that promises catastrophe that will shock. Only God Forgives is gorgeously gory, and while I wouldn't choose it over Drive as Refn's opus, I think this is his most definitive film to date.",Only God Forgives
230,williamzim2000,A stylistic masterpiece,10,20 July 2013,"I found this film mesmerizing. It is an exercise in style, mood, and lighting. And a grand one at that. It was fascinating to watch. The characters are powerful, and the technique to capture them was deft, and creative. I don't want to elaborate with this review, because this is an unusual film, and discussing plot is unnecessary. But it will appeal to students of film, who appreciate art. It is at once a violent version of David Lynch, while maintaining a steady, deliberate pacing few other directors can achieve.I write this only to encourage you to see it, if you love film as creative expression. If you appreciate Nicholas Winding Refin's style, you'll find this one of those few gems in which art and form are masterfully expressed.",Only God Forgives

232,tj0331,Refn getting internal,9,21 July 2013,"Only God Forgives feels like a personal film from Refn. First let me say I enjoyed it immensely. I think any real fan of Refn's work will appreciate the film. I saw several reviews where it was obvious that the viewers did not understand the film or were just inexperienced film viewers. From interviews with Refn I was expecting a real trippy film and it certainly is that. He even said Gaspar Noe's work had inspired him lately. In my opinion it is almost an existential take on revenge. It is beautifully shot and that carries a lot of the film. Refn's style is part of why I am a fan of his. I will be watching it again soon to see if I process it differently. Far as the violence, I am not sure what people are complaining about. It is not over the top like a horror film but at times you get the sense that it could be a slow horror film. I think Refn has a defined idea of what he wants each film to feel like and he goes with it. I have to respect him for that. You cannot expect every film to be as successful as Drive was, but I also wonder if he made this film in response to that success.",Only God Forgives

But I hated Pulp Fiction -not to be compared- the first time and I now love it, and a few others went this way, so I will watch it again in a year or so and my opinion might then be totally different.Still when you watch OGF, you do it with Drive at the back of your mind, and the slow captivating tempo of Drive -and the brilliant soundtrack- seems to have been diluted here to something unbearable. It's like Drive is a lovely macchiato to the average action movie brutal expresso, but OGF is a nasty American filter coffee.

Whether it be the inane screenplay, the pretentious cinematography or the cheesy soundtrack, this is beyond bad. It's embarrassing for all involved. There are quite a few moments that make you squirm in your seat, both because of the sadism with which the violence is enacted (intentional) and the nasty Orientalism with which Thailand is depicted (inescapable). I loved Drive, but this is like a soulless pastiche of the style of Refn's earlier work. Sadly, it seems, a one-hit wonder as a director. A film to be avoided, at all costs.

238,FugitiveAmoeba,An Exposition of Basal Human Behavior,6,10 January 2014,"""Only God Forgives"" - The eagerly awaited follow-up to Nicolas Winding Refn's critically acclaimed ""Drive"" is a baffling film to say the least. The film oozes all the hallmarks that the director is known for: Kubrick-esque languid visuals, Lynch-ian weirdness and unsettling violence. Yet it fails to deliver due to lack of substance, either in the form of character development or a compelling plot. Perhaps the best way to view this film is as an exposition of basal human behavior bereft of the thin veneer of self-restraint ordained by civilization. To that end the film succeeds in portraying the depravity and utter lack of contrition that is so uniquely human. 6.5/10",Only God Forgives
239,frequency-2,"Some say its awful, but at least its different",8,6 November 2013,"There are so many awful films made theses days. A trend that annoys me often is the rapid fire barrage editing. I realize that larger budget English language films are edited more for a global audience than they used to be, and everybody needs to make a buck, but many feature films are, for me, suffering for it. The story gets lost in editing for the non-English speaker. A good example of this was the third ""Bourne"" film.So among my reasons for enjoying ""Only God forgives"" was the time taken to set up the frame and show us pictures with people in them, and give us a few seconds to realize what we are looking at, and perhaps even ponder what those characters are like. I also enjoyed the tableau nature of many of the scenes. Appropriate to the title, often there were three characters arranged and each was clearly an individual. Again, we have time to look at these people and make judgments about them.I also was made to feel a sense of dread for the doomed characters. almost all of them were terribly flawed, bad and likely to murder. So instead of suspense followed by a shock, I felt dread of the inevitable bad end some of the characters got, but also a sense of justice for each of them paying a price for their crimes, both legal and moral.The soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is one of the characters. Or several as it illuminates Thailand as vibrant and unique nation which can be welcoming or devouring. Martinez score is fascinating and essential to the film. It lives inside it as well as outside, a very palpable narrator. I think ""Only God forgives"" is worth watching just for the score.As an American who has been here and there in other countries the film stands out as making the ""foreigners"" stand out as such. Alien in presence, comprehension and motivation to the natives. I think a lot of people may feel ""Chang"" is an evil character. I saw him as the anti- hero of the film and in a way, symbolizing Thailand itself. A nation and culture that has refused colonization and suffered for it, while maintaining it's Buddhist identity, while being a melting pot for so many cultures. ""Chang"" contains so much of what is corrupt through his witnessing of it, and does what he can to stop it when he can.The film was made for less than 5 million dollars. The last ""Die Hard"" stinker cost more than 90 million to make. I think ""Only God forgives"" is one the most interesting film of the past few years made.PS: So many keep mentioning Refn's ""Drive"" and how OGF is not like ""Drive"". Refn is a creative guy. Why should one of his films be ""like"" another? I hope he says ""Thanks, I was not intending to repeat what I did in ""Drive"" since this is a DIFFERENT film."", every time he hears that complaint from yet another misinformed moviefan who thinks a directors films should each be a Big Mac and look and taste the same.Q.,""Hey Frank, how did you like ""the Shining?"""",A.,""Oh I hated it, it wasn't anything like ""Lolita""!"".",Only God Forgives

243,SpitztheGreat,The perfect example of polarizing,3,12 January 2014,"Only God Forgives (OGF) is a great example of a polarizing movie because you either think it's a masterpiece, or you think it's trash.Obviously I belong to the latter group, I found Only God Forgives to be an incredibly painful experience. However, I don't think it deserves a rating of anything lower than a ""3 out of 10"". Anything lower should denote only a movie which is poorly crafted due to incompetence/or is morally reprehensible.With this in mind Only God Forgives is solidly a three. As many other reviewers have mentioned, OGF seems to suffer badly from poor editing. The closest example I can think of is the movie Vampires vs Zombies, which I gave a rating of 1 out of 10. The difference is that the editing of OGF is clearly intentional, attempting to create a style and atmosphere. Similarly, the non linear elements of the story are deliberate and are inserted with forethought. That's why OGF is saved from a one star rating, it doesn't fail because of incompetence like Vampires vs Zombies, it fails because of a lack of execution.That lack of execution is apparent from almost the first minute of the movie and is why it is so polarizing. This is not a situation where those that don't like the movie simply ""don't get it"", this movie just isn't very good. It is not accessible, is not entertaining, is not powerful, and is not well done. It is unfathomable to me how anyone associated with this film, who saw the final product, said ""yes, I'm proud of this."" It strikes me that the director simply got caught in his own little world where he knew what he wanted to do, and damn anyone else who said otherwise.On paper this movie has a lot of really interesting elements, but it took the already divisive approach from Drive and shot it full of steroids. Yes, this movie is VERY different from Drive, but if you hated Drive I think there's no chance you'll like OGF. Additionally, if you like Drive, you may not like OGF at all. The movie is trying too hard to conform to develop its own style without concerning itself with the simply question ""is the style any good?"" No editor in the world is going to save this movie. It is not the editor's job to radically change the movie's style, the movie is assembled exactly as the director saw fit.TL:DR- This movie really isn't any good. I can see what the director was going for in terms of style, but he utterly failed to produce a decent product. The movie doesn't deserve a 1 or 2 star rating because the style was attempted deliberately and just because you didn't like the final results it doesn't mean the movie needed better editing. Simply put the style just doesn't work and everyone involved with the movie should have known it was junk before it was released to ridicule.",Only God Forgives

I had not seen ""Drive"" or any other films on which Refn's reputation rests so came to this film cold. Within ten minutes I was trying hard to resist the temptation to yawn. Within twenty, that urge was becoming a need to leave the cinema, like several others who had lost patience with the film,in the hope that I might get a chance to catch something more worthwhile of my entrance fee at the multiplex. What's wrong with this film - where to start? Everything leads to Refn. Slow,sorry,snail pace, stomach-turning violence, impenetrable red colour palate of the cinematography, deafening ""modern"" soundtrack, criminal mis-direction of quality actors - all come down to him. It is his poor use of the actors that I find most problematic. Ryan Gosling has proved his acting talent - ""Blue Valentine"" is an exceptional tour de force - and here he is a blank. If that is intended then it is down to Refn. The fact that the film comes alive whenever Kristin Scott Thomas is on screen must be down to her ability to rise above the banality of Refn's direction. I kept thinking of the similarity of Refn's current career to that of Michael Cimino and hope that this is not his ""Heaven's Gate"". For those people who want to see a proper ""existential"" film noir, catch Walter Hill's ""The Driver"". It can be done.",Only God Forgives

Ryan Gosling shows good character and a willing to go out of his comfort zone!The film doesn't really hesitate, it gets right into it and stays the same throughout. Yes, its slow.

246,hyperzephyrian,Don't let the rating fool you- Ryan Gosling and Nicolas Winding Refn do it again,7,11 November 2013,"Though a bit slow-paced, and somewhat risqué, this film is visually stunning. Exceptional Direction from Refn, as well as the expected, fantastic work from Ryan Gosling.I had high expectations for this film since I first heard about it, how could I not. Drive was a stellar film, just as Only God Forgives is. Though it's not an American Release, and all Credits are in Thai, (ending credits with the English Translation below them), this only adds to the film's credentials. I was quite disheartened to see the 5.9 rating it's received here on IMDb, quite disheartened.Gosling gives a powerful performance, easily reaching the mark he reached with Drive, and The Place Beyond The Pines.I would not be surprised to see the rating go up, over the next few months.7.0/10",Only God Forgives

Love him in Notebook, Drive, Blue Valentine, All good things, The place beyond the pines, etc. He is hot. And an actor with a wide range. It really is not his fault this movie is so boring. It is the director's. I just don't get what the director is trying to say. There is very little, close to none, dialog. So if you can't guess what the director is trying to tell, then bad luck to you. You get no help. The base tone of the movie is red, which is irritating after 20 minutes. I watched the first 20 minutes at normal speed, just for the love of Ryan. And then have to fast-forward through. Although I have never been to Thailand, I am pretty sure over there you can not just chop up somebody on the street, at night, but in open view, without fear of serious consequences.",Only God Forgives
248,mariogamer2000,"What can I say, I loved this film.",10,19 July 2013,"Due to the film having a August release date in he UK, I thought Id keep up with the U.S and just watch it on VOD. So Only God Forgives?I love films like these, films that have a divided audience when its first released. So was Scarface when it came out, that was panned by every critic and now look at it. This film has every quality to make it a modern day classic and in the coming years, all the people that hated this film will regard it as one. Okay so for all the Drive fans. THIS FILM WAS NOTHING LIKE DRIVE!!!I just wanted to get that out there because apart from similar cinematography, there's no other similarity. If you think Gosling didn't talk in Drive then you will think that hes mouth is glued in this film. So please to all the Pro critics that actually get paid to write reviews, stop comparing it to Drive just because its the same collaboration and easier for you to write a review. Now that out the way I can begin my review. Im not going to start telling you the plot, because Im sure you already know it. But I will tell you this, it is a lot more different then what you think. The plot...So the plot is what a lot of critics are wining about. Let me tell you this, the plot in the film is the foundation for the whole film, yet it does not try and even be important to the film and it does this deliberately.(I know that might not make much sense, but its difficult to explain). Now on top of the basic foundation for the film comes, Amazing cinematography,Emotionless and silent characters, Necessary violence to show the true menace of the characters and an amazing soundtrack.Thats what this film is and that's what the film is trying to be. Nicholas Winding Refn was not trying to make this film for everyone to enjoy, rather he made it with an attitude of 'You'll either love it or hate but you will never forget'. And for me that worked. He put what he wanted in the film and although its not everyone's cup of tea, I enjoyed it. The film is beautiful, the cinematography is a visual treat. All the settings in his film, minimalist style but beautiful. Every prop, every lamp, the pattern and color patterns on the wall, was put and made in a precise way. Every room, every corridor was perfect. The lighting was great, the red brought out the true evil side to the characters.Now the characters for me wont really characters, they were just there for the film. What I mean is, none of them are developed, accept from a last attempt to develop Julian's background story so it can set a good ending. But apart from that, the characters were wooden, that may sound bad. But that's the thing it worked really well for what the film was trying to do, these characters were like paintings, almost like there weren't real humans. Thats why having no Human element to the film, apart from a few intense scenes between Julian and Mai, nothing else is added to add Human element to the film. And for me that worked wonders.Because the film was so visually stunning, the characters were like people in the painting. For example, you look at a painting. You see a portrait of some people, do you know them? Do you know there full back story? No you don't. But what you do see is the expression on there faces, and this is what brings out the emotion. Same with this film. The dialogue wasn't much, but it didn't need it because the visuals told the story well enough. There's no easy way to really analyze this film. It wont be what you expect and there no guarantee you will like it, but you will not easily forget the experience, and believe me even if you didn't like it. You'll be glad for having the experience of watching this film. Most critics make you think they understood this film really well, but most of the critics just panned it which is easy to do. But its not many people who can really travel into the directors mind and appreciate this art. And truly it is. Now the acting. Ryan Gosling was good, even though he was not given much to work with as usual, he had a very strong presence in the film. And when an actor has that, he doesn't even need to act. Just the glares he gave when he was walking down the corridors, you could really feel the haughtiness in his character. Kristine scott thomas was great, you could also feel the menace of her character. But at the same time, and NWR does this well. When the time comes she really does seem a like a totally different character. The actor who plays Chang, for me I think he might of stole the show. He was so emotionless and he did that just great. He looked like a real dude who would slice up, no joke. His menacing was very dimensional and you could really feel his evil presence. Now to conclude my review. Im going to give Only God Forgives 4 out of 5 Stars. (8/10). I think it might be a touch low, I wont know for sure if it deserved a higher rating until I re watch it. Anyway thank you for reading my review and trying to understand it lol. And please do enjoy the film when you watch and enjoy it for what it is.",Only God Forgives

This on the other hand is so pretentious it's untrue....there are scenes when I thought the DVD had stuck.. Gosling just staring into nowhere....a lot. Might be only 90 minutes long, It felt like longer. Dreary, Odd and a lot of zero dialogue which I don't mind if it works but here I don't think it does.

This isn't even a rental, unless you're into scenes of people walking down hallways/streets this film has very little to offer... It says I need to write more lines but to be honest there isn't much left to say. It appears this film was originally intended to be about a Bangkok police officer but I guess they couldn't sell it to a studio so they changed it into some bizarre drug smuggling/incest story. I think Refin has read one too many of his paper clippings and decided to jerk himself off for 90 minutes. Don't waste your time on this film, its garbage...",Only God Forgives
251,Indie_Locker,A completely different film than Drive.,9,20 July 2013,"If Drive was brought to life by its style and color palette, Only God Forgives sends us straight to Hell with its style. It evokes a kind of dream-like feeling that echoes the work of Gaspar Noe. It burns images and scenes into our brain and dazzles us with an effective slow burn technique. Drive was an art-house film that made its way mainstream and critics and audiences all over loved it, but this film will be extremely divisive among those who liked Drive.The film follows Julian (Ryan Gosling) a soft-spoken criminal who manages a kick-boxing arena. Julian is a drug smuggler but that doesn't matter, we just know that he's a criminal in some way and that he has his hands dirty. Once his brother gets killed after committing a horrible and dark act, his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) flies to Bangkok and tries to get Julian to track down his brother's killer. In the midst of it all is a mysterious cop named Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm).The film is set in a dark criminal underworld in Bangkok where nearly every single character seems to have their hands dirty. The film is completely covered in darkness from its very first frame. Bright neon colors soak the environment and illuminate all of the characters. If Refn wanted to make a version of Hell on Earth, he successfully did that with Bangkok. We are completely drawn into this world from the very beginning and we are never let go. Its hypnotic and mesmerizing and dark with strange moments of real beauty to it.There are a few moments in the film when the camera focuses on the characters hands. Julian sometimes looks down at them, his hands are tied by a chair to a woman while he lays eyes on temptation that he can't touch, and Chang cuts off the hands of men with his sword. If Bangkok is Hell, then the people living in it are led to temptation by their hands. The hands take what they want and reach for what they can't have. They pull triggers and get you into trouble. If this is Hell, then Chang is God, by being on the right side of the law and ridding people of their temptation. He is an unstoppable force and is wonderfully played by Pansringarm.Kristin Scott Thomas is wonderful in her role, and even though her character comes from America, with her bleached blonde hair and her long fingernails and the way she holds her cigarette, her hands are every bit as dirty as the inhabitants of this hellish nightmare. She has a nasty look in her eyes and has a kind of control over Julian. There's incestuous vibes at play, in the way that she touches him and some of the things that she says and it clearly has a large influence on Julian as a person. Nothing is said but subtle things are implied and we're left to draw our own conclusions. She says that Julian can leave this place with her and come home, only if he kills his way out.Aesthetically the film is a knockout. Its absolutely gorgeous with vibrant colors enriching each and every frame. Cliff Martinez, a composer who I'm quite a fan of, accomplishes what may be his best work yet. Say what you will about Refn, he's a very visual director and he has his own voice that reflects upon his work. A lot may say that this is a misstep for Refn, but if you ask me, Refn stepped up his game.",Only God Forgives
252,kjs-2,Amazing dark film.,9,2 May 2014,"This film is as close to perfect as any film is likely to get. It features characters that are varying degrees of horrible and just. The setting is one of pervasive violence and constant danger. But in this horrific setting the theme is protection and justice. Perfectly shot, edited and acted. It unfolds quickly while being quiet and menacing with punctuations of intense violence and fear. I really do not wish to say too much. If you liked the Pusher films or Drive then you know what this director brings to the table. Here he is working with a local production. With the success of Drive and the lowish budget of this film he has both the freedom of the first Pusher film mixed with growing confidence and skill. Highly recommended if you can stand the harsh emotional depths and turmoil it will take you through.",Only God Forgives

Refn's previous feature, 'Drive', encountered some hard to digest shifts in filmic tone, but still managed to be an interesting and altogether decent piece of cinema. 'Only God Forgives' manages to maintain a one-note tone throughout and proves to be a dull, pretentious, blood-tainted, art-house revenge tale with wooden performances that genuinely make Pinocchio seem like a real boy. It's hard to know exactly what Refn was shooting for, with his heavy-handed direction, slow plodded (occasionally pretty) camera movements and unintentionally hilarious moments. Don't even get me started on the karaoke-singin'-sword-swingin'-retired-cop that ends the film on a very odd note.Awful.",Only God Forgives
254,JSmith125,The director has confused Orientalist clichés for high art,2,6 June 2013,"OK, I get that the incredibly slow pace -- the characters pose like statues, and everyone stares into space for half a minute or so before delivering a line -- is intentional, that this director thinks he's the second coming of Stanley Kubrick. The difference is that Kubrick actually had something new and interesting to say. What is ""Only God Forgives"" trying to say? That there are some people in the criminal underworld who are messed up, who had bad mothers or brothers, who know they're sinners and want to atone? I've seen all that before. More importantly, I've seen ""the Orient"" depicted exactly this way before -- in fact it's how Westerners have been condescending to the Far East for generations. (See ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.) So, we're in Bangkok -- naturally -- which is essentially one big red-light district (literally: every scene is lit in red), the only businesses are fighting, drug dealing and prostitution, and there's no rule of law to speak of. Instead, there's a senior police officer who goes around exacting justice on his own with some kind of ceremonial sword, which he wields using moves learned from some ancient discipline (didn't catch the name, but I think it's called ""bulshido""). I mean, how about just calling him Hop Sing and giving him a funny accent while we're at it? I expect these sorts of clichés in direct-to-DVD B-movies, and maybe in a movie like ""Hangover II"" where they're being made fun of in some way. But at this late date, to see them in a serious, significant Hollywood release, a Cannes entrant, is pretty shameful.",Only God Forgives

The sparse plot and dialog only add to the stunning visual atmosphere. I often (because it's late at night when I get to watch movies) use headphones and the audio mix is another plus.

257,edwardgamper-0-128609,Doesn't pack a punch,4,13 January 2014,"This felt like a weak imitation of a Takeshi Kitano film. But unlike Sonatine or Boiling Point, the moments of stoic zen like calm punctuated by violence felt contrived rather than controlled.Unbelievably, Gosling was even more dead behind the eyes than he was in Drive, and not one character had a redeemable quality to them.I didn't care about the brother who was rapist psychopath. I didn't care about the mother, who was a murderous creepy, possibly incestuous psychopath. I didn't care about the Thai cop, who was a hair-pin wielding poor-man's Kitano (with none of the charisma) psychopath. And I didn't care about Gosling, who was an attractive, but date rapey dress-grabbing drug dealing psychopath.South East Asia has awesome potential as a location for a thriller, but this was a strangely empty Thailand, and most of our time was spent pointlessly following Gosling down dark red corridors to encounter completely unexplained apparitions of the Thai cop, that was probably meant to mean something but came off as discount David Lynch.This is a film about boring nasty people. If they all got shot at the end you wouldn't care. If they all jumped off a bridge at the start, it wouldn't make a difference. The best thing about this film is Kristen Scott Thomas swearing, and even that gets a little dull after you realise her character has little more to do.Sorry, but this is pretentious pap.

258,rio197,"If you've seen Drive, you've seen this movie.",6,23 May 2013,"Only God Forgives is a movie that is driven inherently by its visuals and not much else. Without giving away too much, Julian (Ryan Gosling) is being coaxed by his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) to avenge the killing of his brother.Looking from the directing perspective, if you've seen Drive there's no point in seeing this. I felt like Nicolas Refn is testing the limits of the audience because the first 30 minutes felt like a test of restraint on my part. Maybe his style just isn't my thing.In the acting department, Thomas is very memorable. Her overbearing and somewhat peculiar mother is very effective in providing an anchor for the audience to make up their own minds about the motivations of her sons. Her work is exemplary.I recommend seeing this if you consider yourself a fan of the movies. However if you're looking for a memorable story you might want to look elsewhere.",Only God Forgives
259,gdg23,A Banquet of Bloody Meringue,4,13 August 2013,"To start with let me admit that, yes, I did see Drive, and no I haven't seen anything else by this director. Does that mean my opinion of this movie holds any less validity? Well i'll leave you to decide.As many reviewers have said if you're expecting Drive 2 (which, for the record, I wasn't) then you will be very disappointed. 'Only God Forgives' is a journey into a world of violence and revenge, crime and punishment, power and powerlessness, teetering between reality and fantasy. Big, tasty subjects that have been quenching cinema-goers appetites for decades.The story begins with the death of a prostitute, killed by one of two brothers who run boxing matches as a cover for a drug-smuggling operation in Bangkok. The prostitute's father avenges her, beating his daughter's murderer to death. This leads to the arrival of mother (Scott-Thomas) seeking revenge for the loss of her favourite son. Julian (Gosling) plays the largely silent, brooding 'other' brother who fails to kill the prostitute's father as instructed by mother-not-so-dearest. Undeterred she takes a hit out on the father, and so begins a chain of violence involving an otherworldly ex-police chief, his very sharp sword, and some eye-watering torture involving Chinese hairpins.The visuals in this film match its themes in size and impact. Refn etches his heavily stylised Bangkok underworld onto our retinas; each scene is undeniably meticulously crafted, a lavish banquet of colour and sound. But I found my appetite curiously unsated. It was rather like being (slowly) served a delicious looking and smelling roast dinner, only to find that when I hungrily attacked the thick, juicy slices of lamb, it crumbled like meringue.All style and no substance? I don't know if i'd go that far, but for me this film flatters to deceive. Certain elements felt rather self-consciously concocted, Julian's semi-sexual relationship with his mother for example, or the karaoke singing police chief; like a carefully staged, but not very convincing, Lynch tribute.There is plenty of violence too, I don't have a particular problem with that but in many cases it felt unnecessary and gratuitous.In the end then I was left hungry, it was like being served beef wellington without the beef (can you tell i'm hungry as I write this?), a rather hollow experience that promises much more. I guess you could argue that films that provoke such polar reactions as this one has are somehow by definition successful. But those of us who had to raid the fridge when we got home might disagree...",Only God Forgives

In my viewing I found none of the characters remotely interesting or relatable. The film looks beautiful, and the violence is chilling. It is those two things that I feel I should give it any credit at all. Slow scenes make the movie boring rather than tense due to character development and world building being practically non-existent. Overall, without ranting on a movie that others may enjoy, I simply cannot recommend this to anyone. The whole thing felt like an endurance test, similar to how I felt watching Requiem for a Dream or Irréversible, but without any emotional impact or payoff in the end.

If you are like me, you will watch this movie regardless of the comments here, because you want to decide for yourself, but prepare to be disappointed. That's all I'm saying.",Only God Forgives
269,saad_sa11,Stuck in the middle,9,19 June 2013,"Bangkok has got a very direct way of delivering justice XDWas not expecting the plot to go that way, but then I remembered the first hallway scene and it made me go ""ohhhh"". Came out of the movie with a big, dumb grin on my face. Very pure, artistic, crime ""thing"" (hesitate to call it a drama or thriller, it's only really comparable to other Refn movies). Snyder and Peter Jackson, this is how you do badass slow motion. Just like Drive, walking out of the cinema made me involuntarily want to emulate a cool walk and mysterious look :P Not just pure in terms of using mostly imagery to tell a story like Valhalla Rising but also very barebones in its plot.I don't know why people bothered pointing out Gosling has only 7 lines in the movie, when there's enough dialogue from other characters to keep you abreast of the simple plot. Honestly, it could be a silent movie and the visual storytelling would still do its job.Kristin Scott Thomas is a lot of fun!Absolutely worth seeing on the big screen if you get the chance for the impeccable wallpaper-worthy cinematography, doom-laden synthy/oriental Cliff Martinez greatness (a hallway scene is straight up 70's sci-fi horror music), and getting to see all that glorious violence in gut-wrenching detail. Some of it made me wince and squirm in my seat. Refn has got a master handle on tension, there's more of those Drive ""gunshots at pawnshop"" type moments here. The violence is not prolonged (except for an amazing torture sequence), it's punctuated at just the right moments to keep each of them memorable. That sword, boy does it get some work.Some people might say it's style over substance, but I got more out of it than just a pretty audiovisual experience. It's not quite a revenge thing, or a sweeping crime drama, it's very 1-on-1 but with different characters on both sides. The whole Oedipal complex was a bit unnerving. It's about cutting the line of violence, with Julian's family and all his links. Very much a Greek tragedy feel. Julian stuck in the middle and no one will forgive his neutral role in this. Bangkok police getting work done!",Only God Forgives
270,pelonace,Lynch meets Refn,6,20 July 2013,"I was really hyped when hearing about this movie being that Drive was one of my favorite movies of 2011, Bronson being another favorite from Refns and though Valhalla Rising wasn't a masterpiece it was okay. From a movie makers standpoint its visually impressive, Refn uses beautiful lighting and astounding camera work which you expect from his type of movies. The music wasn't spot on but some of the soundtrack i really enjoyed. Now what the movie lacks is pretty much everything else, Julian is basically playing The Driver from Drive but really no motive or explanation on why hes acting that way though for a quiet character i could say he wasn't horrible. From what I could gather there was a decent plot it was just the way the whole movie was executed it felt a bit pretentious, too many scenes of silence and staring. It is pretty violent which i'm all for violence but it just felt really out of place in some scenes.I personally felt like I was watching a David Lynch film which isn't a bad thing but I like said before just direction the movie takes it really not all that exciting. I can only recall 2 scenes that were above average but the rest of the movie is pretty much a let down. I didn't hate this movie but I didn't love it either if your a fan of Nicolas Winding Refn you should definitely check it out but just don't expect anything like Drive.",Only God Forgives
271,thedudejh,A dark and mesmerizing cinematic experience,8,9 February 2014,"A strangely beautiful yet dark and gratuitously violent film. Refn's follow-up to Drive puts him and Ryan Gosling together again and if you thought Gosling spoke little in Drive; he says even less in this movie. A lot of people have criticized the film for its cold portrait of violence that seems to have no purpose sometimes. My thought on that? Ridiculous; Refn doesn't put anything in a movie for the hell of it. With a movie this meticulous and metaphoric nothing is done for the sake of just doing it. Some people had the same complaint with Drive too, but this film amps it up even more. You find yourself surrounded with all these lowlife scumbag characters in a dark (yet neon filled) Thailand full of drugs, murder, sex trafficking, and of course revenge. You'd think with these kind of characters you wouldn't be invested at all and you'd hate them. It's the opposite really. You love to hate them and you are on the edge of your seat waiting for what's going to happen next. Everything from the performances, the multilingual script, to the practical effects, cinematography, and the ambient industrial/electronic score is enjoyable and suiting. I highly recommend this movie; very enjoyable and powerful.",Only God Forgives
272,thaibm,Spoiler! Ryan failed me and so did the movie,4,24 July 2013,"The following review come from an ex film student who currently lives in Bangkok, the main setting of the movie. There is no subtler way to describe this B-grade film noir than ""a waste of time"". Most people flocks to the cinema for this movie clandestinely to see Ryan Gosling. To most of Gosling fans surprise and maybe himself, his acting cannot save the movie from sinking. in fact, he got drown together with the dim-lit movie. He doesn't have any good lines, not a good single fighting scene. The eye-catching violent scene in the trailer where we saw him dragging a guy in the floor by his jaw was terribly woven into the story. But Ryan is not alone. It seems like his cohorts share the same confusion within the too simplistic storyline which was trying to hard to become sophisticated and exotic. YayaYing, rising local star after her debut in Jandara remake, present in Cannes this year to promote the movie, failed to match her performance in the Thai erotic classic. Her character was actually questionable in terms of relevancy. It built nothing into the main story of Ryan's revenge for his brother and was too shallow to develop into romance. It was too hefty a task to act shrewd in a too thin storyThe final drawback come from the oft-repeated effort to build Bangkok as an exotic Asian city. Being an expat living in the city for almost 2 years, i know a fake representation when i see one. The attempt was decent in terms of art direction, but it was not authentic in terms of reality. Maybe the director was trying to hard to make this B-grade script into a David Lynch master piece",Only God Forgives
273,ovidnine,Drive 2- This time there's no car.,3,30 December 2013,"Take all the weird boring staring scenes in Drive. Change the color scheme to blacks, reds, purples. Throw in random scenes of gratuitous violence. Strip away almost all dialog and the car.Done all that? You have Only God Forgives. Now, does this movie have no positives? Nope, its has some. A really cool score, some interesting camera angles and cinematography, and....ummm. OK, its got those things going for it.Otherwise, its awful. I mean, bored to tears, WTF is the point of this movie awful. Its your typical ""artsy"" action movie which means next to no action, lots of long shots of nothing in particular, and over the top gore when it happens.I know some people will like this movie. I can kind of see why, though I strongly disagree with their opinion. But if you watched this movie expecting anything like a ""traditional"" movie you're probably going to be disappointed.It also doesn't help you have no reason to care about a single character in the movie. None, there is no character development, there is no connection to the characters, a very few things happen and then its over. And if you're like me, you're left not caring.I gave it a 3 because the three aspects I liked were really good, but the rest of the movie is atrociously bad.",Only God Forgives
274,josh-rimmer-1127,"Unfairly treated, quietly brilliant but sometimes disappointing masterpiece",8,24 July 2013,"I read up all the reviews for this movie before checking it out myself and as a total sum up I think that this film as been very unfairly judged. The fact that it was basically booed out of the Cannes film festival was utterly stupid. The films direction and cinematography is bang on, the performance from Ryan Gosling is actually despite what people have said quite brilliant. A lot of people have complained that he doesn't do anything passed his facial expression and is just an obedient dog to his mother, but the is even a line said by his mother that he was ""different"" and in that they mean in the head and if you look closely enough you can see that in Gosling's performance. The only thing that let it down for me was the editing which put scenes that come into the film that take a long time a few views to understand and even then, some of them a pointless. The ending though was the biggest let down for me. There I was expecting the big final fight between Ryan Gosling's character and the main bad guy with there swords but instead you get Gosling offering his hands to the bad guy who his undoubtedly going to cut them off though you never see it and you never see what happens to Gosling's character. But all moaning aside the film is very, very good and is something I recommend to watch simply because of the great directing and cinematography and of course Ryan Goslings unfairly judged performance.",Only God Forgives

276,kingwreck,Only god forgives the viewers,2,24 July 2013,"Where to start with a train wreck of a movie, which looks good like all accidents. From the start you are introduce to Julian (Gosling) a drug smuggler who operates a Thai boxing gym with screwed up brother Billy. Billy has a dark side; which he screws a minor prostitute and murders her. That did not bode well for Billy; as he himself gets murder by the father selling his daughter. Long story short ,Chang a police officer takes the right arm and murder's the father. What ensues is a overall hatred of every character. There is zero investment in even liking and watching this film.Then enter Julian's and Billy's mom, who is easily the most hateful of the bunch. I get what the movie is trying to say in crime not paying but invest in character and story arch. This is a bland movie which has even blander performances, Gosling floated in a zero effort performance. Chang and Julian confront and sure there's good tension but with little dialogue or investment of these characters a better movie it would of been. Considering how Julian has disgust for his dead brother and his own mother. Which revenge for family is a badge of honour but without a better origin of these characters. A movie I only hope god can forgive me for viewing.",Only God Forgives
277,NightTrekker,I can't begin to understand the negativity on this one,9,18 January 2014,"I'm not sure what's to blame for the overwhelmingly negative reception--critical and popular--towards Only God Forgives. It seems too condescending and self-congratulatory to dismiss the critics by saying they ""just didn't get it"" or to slander audiences with the ADD-generation label. But still, I'm stuck without an explanation as to how such a fantastic (and admittedly challenging) film was so completely trashed by people who really should have known better.Maybe it was due to Refn's preceding film, Drive, which arguably introduced him to American audiences. (Refn's earlier English release Fear X, which stylistically shares a lot in common with OGF, came and went relatively unheralded, perhaps for many of the same reasons this film was disliked.) While OGF shares the same leading man as Drive, there the similarities between the two end. Maybe critics and audiences expected or wanted a spiritual successor to Drive instead of the spare, smoldering film they got.Maybe only a few critics were familiar with Refn's earlier films. The average moviegoer can't be expected to have seen Refn's earlier Danish films such as Valhalla Rising, but I have to assume at least some of the professionals were familiar with the director's body of work. If that's so, I can sympathize. As an introduction to Refn's directorial and writing style, VH was admittedly a challenge for me, though I ultimately loved the experience. Like OGF, the on-screen action (one almost wants to call it ""movement"" instead) unfolds at a surreal, disconcerting, and potentially frustrating pace, and the paucity of dialog and the shocking violence demanded the sometimes confused and frustrated viewer (and I was!) continue watching, putting faith in the director's abilities and intentions.Or maybe--and I'm just speculating here--something about the substance of OGF repulsed viewers. The film's Bangkok exists as a nightmarish, neon-lit slum cloaked in an almost perpetual night. Violent crime seems not to be extraordinary or particularly shocking to its citizens. The major players are almost exclusively damaged, severely dysfunctional people, and some are outright monstrous. (Come to think of it, I am not sure there is a single shot of a person genuinely smiling throughout the entire thing.) And the violence, while sometimes only implied, is truly brutal. There seems, in my experience, to be a growing and reactionary political mindset/philosophy that rebukes all things remotely violent as unacceptable. I wonder if that's not the case here.Honestly, I suspect it's a little bit of all of these things. I can see how OGF's oddly deliberate pacing, the director's off-putting style—as a friend well described it, the action seems to be driven by the camera's determined movements, not by dialog or character movement—and the deeply unpleasant and disturbing subject matter could all come together to convince someone they are watching a Bad Movie.But violence in a film (or, indeed, anything depicted in any work of art) does not imply an acceptance or endorsement of violence on the part of the film or its director. From a professional, competent storyteller, an unpleasant experience can be assumed to be intentionally unpleasant and to serve a purpose. And the idiosyncrasies of a director's personal style can be either pointlessly spurned by the viewer or accepted, if only temporarily, as a part of the intended experience. Confusion and lack of perfect understanding do not have to mean the audience gives up and prematurely passes judgment in exasperated bewilderment. (I imagine some of these critics watching a Tarkovsky film and their heads exploding.) I think that these are all fairly obvious and widely accepted truths when dealing with art.So I'm back to my original problem: why was OGF overwhelmingly hated by critics and audiences? I have no clear understanding.But if you watch films for more than just entertainment, if you're comfortable with art even (or especially) when you don't understand it, I'm sure YOU should ignore the negative consensus and give Only God Forgives a try. In my opinion, Refn hasn't directed a single bad film, and I believe Only God Forgives is among his best. Just be prepared for the challenge.",Only God Forgives
278,sbw123,Easily one of the worst movies of 2013,1,17 December 2013,"This was easily one of the worst movies of 2013. I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage. The movie should be called, ""Ryan Gossling Stares"" because that is all that seems to be going on in it, Gossling and the supporting cast staring pointlessly, and endlessly. The director was obviously trying to make some symbolic artistic statement about something - violence perhaps - but that statement was lost on me. Gossling's brother is needlessly violent with literally no explanation and that sets the tone for the movie. It is insinuated that Gossling himself is violent, but he fails in his attempts and violence. Chang the policeman is violent, but in some weird vigilante manner that always ends with him singing karaoke in an empty bar to his co-workers. Gossling's mom order's others to do violent acts and seems to know that it will come back to bite her in the butt. All of this with the backdrop of dark rooms with weird lighting and minimal - and I mean minimal dialog left me scratching my head and saying ""huh?"" Don't waste your time with the movie unless you're way into art house movies and speculating about pretentious artistic statements.",Only God Forgives
279,NFSpoet,One of the finest Gems in recent times,9,22 October 2013,"It's hard to review movie like this, when you've experienced excellence of this level. Only God Forgives, is not a movie, it is a static of the Human Society. How we as mortals act and try to act. Our actions, in the name of religion, family, beliefs, are all central to our own greed at the core.The movie starts a little off color, and for the first 3 minutes you feel, that you might have made a mistake...but then the shot cuts to the inside, literally and figuratively. Gosling has smashed another scintillating performance, nailing to the heights a shadowy character, and lifting him to depths beyond the realms of current gen Movies. Tom Burke, although has very little screen time, but grips your attention to the fullest, and makes you admire the psycho. But the crunch of the pie has to go to Kristin Scott, who excels as the weird mother and boss. She overshadows a star of Gosling's stature with ease here, with those near incestuous looks and hate. If I had to choose a weak link, and really just for the sake of pointing one out, I'd say Chang's character could have been a little darker or lighter. I'm not sure, but somehow he seemed a little clichéd, or maybe that was the intention. Only God Forgives, is for me, the Movie of the Year. Once you're done watching this, you'd either hate it, loathe it's existence, or you'd adore it and lust for more. It makes you realize that at the very core forgiveness is perhaps our most carnal emotion, but is disguised by our superficial affections to the people around us.",Only God Forgives
280,Conradical19,"Unconventional and slow, yet stylish. You'll need plenty of patience to watch this.",5,9 September 2014,"On the box for this DVD, it states that the running time is 86 minutes approximately which makes it shorter than the average film. However, this film is extremely slow and quiet because it lacks dialogue and it lacks action. This, ultimately, makes the film feel much longer than it actually is. Don't expect all the dialogue to be in English either. After reading a string of comments about this film, I was expecting strong bloody violence throughout and prepared my senses for it. However, I was wrong to expect Rambo 4 or The Raid. Although this film has strong violence and graphic detail (such as a smashed skull and exposed ribs with blood squirts), the violence is infrequent. Some of it is off-shot and implied and roughly 90% of the time, you see it coming because Vithaya Pansringarm (Chang) always gets his sword out first. There is also one long scene of torture which is particularly unpleasant and a couple of instances where children witness people being killed. On the other hand, there are a couple of exciting action sequences in the film, particularly the long awaited boxing fight between main characters Julian and Chang towards the end, but they did not feel that climactic.Nicolas Winding Refn clearly has his own style of directing. The directing focuses more on the visuals and the places. There are some nice daylight shots but the nightlife has a strong neon element which creates a contrast in the shots yet makes it hard for the viewer to see everything clearly in the shot. However, in some cases this is perhaps a good thing as you wouldn't want to see the gratuitous detail of the bloodshed in the shot. This film is postmodern in some respects. There are a few sequences, mainly in the first half of the film, that represent what's going on in the head of Ryan Gosling's character (Julian) rather than what's actually going on in the reality of the film. In other words, there are frequent metaphor's and montage's that make up what this film is about rather than the conventional use of action to tell us what's happening. My girlfriend (who is the Ryan Gosling fan girl) said she wished she had done this for her psychoanalysis module at uni because there is certainly an Oedipus complex portrayed throughout this film between Julian and his family. These themes and directing style are it's redeeming qualities that make it a film of some worth. Unlike some postmodern films which demand interpretation from the audience, Only God Forgives has a fairly clear and simple narrative.Nevertheless, there are some scenes which I feel are unnecessary or could have been cut down at least either because they are random or because nothing is happening. The acting from the protagonists is often plain with no expression which sucks the life from the living in this film. There are also two or three song performances in this film and I thought, 'Has this film suddenly become a musical?' Besides the singing, the film has a good soundtrack I think. It's a bizarre film though because it is not what you would typically expect or not what I expected at least.The characters are generally unlikable too. All the women are just portrayed as sexual objects including Julian's mother, Crystal, albeit an influential character and more powerful than the male characters in a lot of respects. However, she is a sick and twisted character which is shown in one scene where Julian justifies the death of his brother by explaining, ""He raped and killed a 16 year old girl."" To which Julian's mother responds, ""I'm sure he had his reasons."" I wouldn't say Gosling plays a good guy but his character is about as good as a character can get in this film and therefore perhaps the best choice for a protagonist. This film has unpleasant themes throughout and portrays Bangkok in a purely degrading manner which may be a realistic view but since I have no personal experience of Bangkok, I can neither agree nor disagree with it. The film's title, Only God Forgives, is appropriate given the kind of villainy that is heavily portrayed here. However, it may be misleading for some Christian viewers who I discovered have simply commented on the film saying, ""there is no mention of God or forgiveness."" Yeah. It is fair to say you would also be mistaken to expect both of these things.In conclusion, the soundtrack and the visual elements were good and the injury detail was chillingly well done. Therefore this film had some style. There was a clear plot but no nice characters and plenty of obscure sequences which were difficult to place. There wasn't an over-abundance of violence, swearing, drugs, sex and thankfully no rape scene, regardless of it all being acting. However, it still deserves the 18 rating. The biggest drawback is it's pace. Just too slow. Be warned, this is not an easy film to sit through and watch and it is unpleasant throughout but nevertheless not a dreadful film and still deserves some credit.",Only God Forgives
281,Nesvrstani,Never saw anything like it.,8,7 July 2013,"After watching as many movies as I did, you kinda feel like there isn't much else out there that can surprise you. Boy, was I wrong. Without going into any spoilers or too much detail, this is a truly unique movie, and because of that, it might not be for everyone.Extreme violence, spectacular cinematography, not much dialogue or monologue for that matter, and a painfully slow pace. But at the end, me and a friend of mine, we went out with big smiles on our faces. The other ~9 people in the theater, didn't. So you get the point, I hope. It's nothing like Drive, other than the similar visual style. It's slow, at time extremely confusing, with loads of Freudian theories like the Oedipus complex, etc. Don't watch the movie expecting cliché action or story development, because you will be thoroughly disappointed.Go see the movie if you want a visual treat, like Refn's work, and don't mind some of the most realistic death and torture scenes I have ever seen.",Only God Forgives
282,Jay-Klee,Time to Meet the Devil.,6,28 July 2013,"When Only God Forgives was announced, I was stoked. Drive was my favorite film of 2011, and the re-teaming of Refn and Ryan Gosling...I mean, how could you go wrong? The original plot was listed as: A Bangkok police lieutenant and a gangster settle their differences in a Thai- boxing match.However, that must have changed. That's only a few minutes of the film. The actual plot has nothing to do with that. The synopsis should have read: A drug dealer's mother hunts down the men that killed her son.This film is available in VERY select theaters or on VOD right now at home. I went the at home route, as it was not playing anywhere near me. So...did I like it? This film is very hard to explain. It's very avant-garde, and very 'old Kubrick'. It's almost all visual, with little dialogue to support it. All in all, Ryan Gosling only says about fifteen lines of dialogue. That being said, the visuals are amazing. Cliff Martinez does an amazing job creating a very unique look in Thailand...lots of contrasting reds and blues. The score also stands out as swooning synths back the scenes not set to Karaoke music...and there are a few of those. The characters in this film (aside from the police lieutenant) are all unlikable. There are various levels of filth, from Gosling's 'impotent watcher' to pedophiles, to sadistic mothers. The lieutenant does leave an impression as a justice seeking machine, with little conscience. I cannot say much more about the characters without spoiling things, so I won't. The plot is very thin. It's basically a standard revenge story. The violence is sporadic but fierce. There's a torture scene in here that is definitely not for the squeamish.The acting is serviceable. Gosling is withdrawn and blank. Most of his acting in this movie consists of errant stares. Kristen Scott Thomas does a pretty good job as a mix of Courtney Love meets Lucille Bluth in a sadistic mother role. Vithaya Pansringarm is fantastic as Chang.A lot of people are going to hate this film. Gosling is even more withdrawn than he was in Drive, and Refn is in full on art house mode here. This is for fans of Drive and even more so, Valhalla Rising. If you didn't like those, you'll hate Only God Forgives. Dave Chen from /Film described the film as 'Ryan Gosling walking down red hallways, fingering people'. Not everyone is going to 'get' this one.I did not hate it. I also did not like it right away, but the more I thought about it afterward, the more I did like it. It left an impression on me. It's a beautifully crafted film, and I would definitely watch it again. Final Score: 3/5",Only God Forgives
283,g-boyle3,Only God can forgive this movie,2,7 August 2013,"When I watch a movie, in order to enjoy it, it must tick at least three boxes: the visual effect, good storyline and decent acting. However Only God forgives was able to maintain one of these three attributes and that was the visual effect. I can only describe this movie as modern art. It was enigmatic, and the acting was painfully dire. I've enjoyed Ryan Gosling since movies such as ""murder by numbers"" and the ""united states of Leland"" where his performances were truly notable. My respect for him as an actor has declined due to this agonising display of a tedious protagonist out for revenge. His facial expression did not change once throughout the movie, he looked like an insomniac. I wouldn't go as far as to say that his reputation is irreparable but it behoves him to do an Oscar winner after this. A lot of people are saying that this movie is for intellectuals, and I get that its uniquely visceral, but that doesn't excuse the mundane storyline.Julian(Ryan Gosling) is forced to avenge his brother's death by his psychotic mother who he has a very inappropriate relationship with, to say the least. He finds his brothers killer, lets him go, he's murdered by someone else anyway. They find out that some sort of super cop was involved (who by the way loves castrating people). The mother tries to have him assassinated, she then becomes a target and is killed in a very gory scene after the attempt fails. Julian ends up with no hands as part of some unusual punishment this cop likes subjecting criminals to. It all just seems pointless.I can only commend this movie on gore and its visceral effect. There were some shockingly violent scenes that would rival most movies in its genre and the visual effects in many of the scenes were a delight. The storyline killed though I have no interest in analyzing the human psyche in that depth, each scene was as frustrating as the next and there are 5 minute adverts on TV with better dialog than this. It's not worth watching for any fan of real movies, If you are pretentious and like to believe that you are of superior intelligence to other avid movie fans. By all means watch it and love it.",Only God Forgives

It's as terrible as getting a plastic Pinto kit for Christmas, instead of the M.A.S.K.'s Thunder Hawk that you begged Santa Claus to bring, even though you know he's not real because you found him passed out next to the tree in a pool of cookies/milk flavored vomit and he's really your uncle. I haven't been so disappointed in a movie since Indiana Jones hid in a refrigerator while battling aliens and Russians.There isn't a single redeeming quality to Only God Forgives, unless you like elongated, useless scenes without any clarity or reasoning, except for the few occasions when the lead character is actually asleep. It's like watching Donnie Darko and missing the first ten minutes or the last hundred. I found more pleasure watching Disney's Song of the South with the entire Rome High football team, and yes I did play for them for two years.The basis of the movie is that Gosling's character Julian is a drug smuggler in Bangkok working under his vicious brother Billy, who uses their Thai boxing ring as the front of operations. Soon Billy becomes the focus of retired cop Chang (played brilliantly by Vithaya Pansringarm), who's also known among the underworld as the Angel of Vengeance. Chang is brought back into the force due to his swift and deadly enforcement of justice, and soon finds a way to end Billy's reign. After which, the boys' aggressive mother Crystal (English Patient's Kristin Scott Thomas) shows up to be a complete witch, and pushes Julian to seek revenge for his brother's death. Then Gosling gets beat up worse than Contra's Red Falcon after using the Konami Code, and thus the movie ends. In the middle is a bunch of David Lynch style nonsense, and weird Japanese confusion. That's it.Now I know all you ladies are saying the same thing, and yes Ryan Gosling is in it and I'm sure looks better than whatever you're sleeping next to right now. Despite what you care, I'm actually a fan of Gosling as his movie roles so far have been fantastic, e.g. Lars and the Real Girl, Half Nelson, The Place Beyond the Pines, The Ides of March, and even The Notebook (which if you've read my review, you'll know why). But his character exhibits as much emotion as Paul Walker in anything, and this is what scares me most about Gosling. While the lack of enthusiasm works in films such as Drive and The Believer, he's starting to come across as a talentless actor with limited range. I'm rooting for the guy, but it seems like his characters are becoming more lethargic than Eeyore, and makes Kristen Stewart look like Mayor McCheese. If I want to be entertained by a sullen character who seems anti-social 99% of time then I'll just re-read my high school poetry book.Go see Only God Forgives if you hate yourself, everyone you know, the keeper of time, Jesus or Buddha, and happiness. And as for Ryan Gosling, please follow Tom Hardy's approach and take on at least one solid flick with good merit before you confuse your fans. Just because you have a few memes, that are probably misquoted, doesn't mean you won't go back to doing Goosebump's episodes at some point.If an infinite amount of monkeys typing for an eternity were to actually exist, Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives would definitely be the first script they'd produce.

285,hansolo111,Awful...Truly Awful...,1,20 July 2013,"With agonizingly long still shots, obviously aimed at appearing 'Art House', this movie is an exercise in frustrating the audience, leading to explosive anger. Those who can bear to sit and suffer their way through this tripe, will then be hurling both popcorn and abuse at the screen come the finale.It is clear from the style of the movie that the Director is seeking to sell the story using imagery and acting - it doesn't! This movie lacked sufficient depth of the characters, and relied far too heavily on the style, imagery and sound-track to deliver a movie intended for the audience to follow the story without many words. However, such a movie style relies upon the creation of some back-story on the characters in order to understand what they may be thinking or feeling in certain scenes, and thus carry the movie forward. With the absence of character back-stories, this movie had all the depth and feeling of a sheet of paper. Most of the time, I had no idea what was going on or what it had to do with the main story.So, in summary: if you know someone who is pissing you off, because their just too damned happy, buy them a ticket.",Only God Forgives
286,hwpo1122,Enter: Only God Forgives,10,3 November 2013,"First of all, I must say that upon my first viewing, I absolutely hated this film with a passion. It seemed to me to be a horrendous steaming pile of garbage. But upon my second and third times viewing it, I chose to open my mind and allow myself to not be clouded by general expectations and subconscious predetermined desires for a ""normal"" film. I know that many people hate this film and it has become one of those ""you either love it or hate it"" kind of affairs. But I must strain it as much as possible that this film is not average, it is not normal, it is not anything you have seen or will see! It is a dazzling work of art that is breathtaking and cynical at the same time.The film revolves around a man named Julian who runs a Muay Thai gym to cover up a drug operation. His brother Billy rapes and murders a sixteen year old girl and then a vigilante-like cop named Chang sets the girl's father upon Billy which results in his death. This calls for Julian's and Billy's mother to fly down and demand Chang's and the girl's father's heads on a pike. Chang, played by Vithaya Pansringarm, is perhaps the greatest villain cop ever! I can only compare Chang to Gary Oldman's Norman Stansfield from Leon: The Professional. He is definitely the highlight of this film when it comes to the acting chops. I find it interesting because while directing the film, Refn in between takes would whisper into his ear: ""You are God"". That is very much so what Chang symbolizes in this film.Nicolas Winding-refn has a strange style of narration that relies heavily on little dialogue and mostly imagery and symbolism. From films like 'Bronson' and 'Drive' and 'Valhalla Rising', you will get the idea of his directing style. Only God Forgives utilizes this style maybe even more than his previous films but does so in a truly mesmerizing way.Imagine if David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick made a film together in their prime. That is what Only God Forgives brings to the table. If you hated it on your first viewing, I strongly encourage you to watch it again and with a more open mind. I have come to appreciate it as possibly one of the greatest films ever made and I hope that everyone who reads this will either somewhat know what to expect or will give it another chance.",Only God Forgives
287,nebulous-63784,Only God Forgives Will Emotionally Confuse You,7,19 June 2016,"The first time I saw Only God Forgives, I knew I liked it. I just didn't get what it was trying to tell me. From a cop who is pretty much a manifestation of GOD to Gosling wanting his hands chopped off by that same cop who murdered his brother, Only God Forgives WILL emotionally confuse you. So what's good about it? On a technical level, it's brilliant. The music and visuals help create a dream-like atmosphere that gives the film a unique, stylish personality. Plus, a fight takes place between Gosling and the God Cop which is one of the best fight scenes I have EVER seen. Even if you feel no connections with the characters thus creating an emotional experience, the choreography and acting from the two fighters make it incredible to watch. Overall this was Drive but with a focus on the look than the story.",Only God Forgives
288,skot-21,Nobody Should Forgive anyone involved with this movie.,2,19 July 2013,"I won't lie, there's some really beautiful shots in this movie, truly. However that's the first major problem with this film. There's a major difference between cinematography and photography, this movie would have worked better if it was a 50 piece photography exhibit, rather then 90 minutes of people staring blankly while the camera zooms in or out. Yeah, that's not great cinematography anymore when you use it every other shot, that's being a lazy hack. Walking, lots of walking in this movie, people practically in slow-mo, not in any real hurry to get anywhere as the camera pans across them. There's a few scene of violence that is pretty graphic. Take out all the staring and walking, long slow zooms and pans this movie would have a run time of about 36 minutes.No real character development, no likable character, very little emotion displayed by anyone on any level. It's trying to be all weird and trippy, but honestly it gets annoying real quick not being able to tell if the main character is on opium or just sitting around staring blankly. He yells 3 words of dialog around the halfway point to show us he's actually alive and not a prop. Seriously, he has about 10 lines total, little of it is important to the story and none of it memorable.Yeah, this is one of those flick by a director that takes himself way too seriously and is trying to be an ""artist"" and is too pretentious to know when quit.",Only God Forgives
289,shonufftx22,Great visually,6,20 July 2013,"The movie is pretty good, slow but good. I think it could have been told as a music video. Very little dialogue and lots of ambient music. It does bounce around quite a bit from the story to day dreams/hallucinations but the cinematography is beautiful. The camera tell most of the story and that is the reason for 6 stars. Every time I thought about walking away something visual grabbed me. Ryan Gosling role could have been played by a mute, but the lack of emotion and lines some how fit the character. The mother, Kristin Scott Thomas was very creepy yet amazingly portrayed. I can not be the only person who thought there was some crazy sexual tension going on there a few times. All in all if you have 90 minutes to waste you could do worse.",Only God Forgives
290,McGheeTerry,Disturbingly Beautiful,7,23 August 2013,"Director Nicolas Winding Refn (""Drive"", ""Bronson"") puts together a visually stunning film in Only God Forgives. The plot might seem to move slowly for some, but a true fan of the art of acting as well as anyone who enjoys a good play will be very excited to watch as the story unfolds like a flower from a Golden Shower Tree.The story takes place in Thailand, where the streets are filled with a slow moving mass of chaos and the sets lit with neon that drapes shadows through the pattern of the architecture. This is a very disturbingly beautiful picture that makes perfect sense to only those who don't need a leash to lead them along.Most of the dialog is in Siamese and subtitled, save for a handful of lines that are mostly given by the overly dramatic and emotionally manipulative character of Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) who plays a very overbearing and demanding Westerner in a foreign land that she finds to be beneath herself.Ryan Gosling plays the part of damaged son to perfection, with his well timed glances and movements that are never out of sync with his frenzied state of calm.Aside from the Cinematography being almost perfect in every scene, one of the great aspects of this film is how it takes our main character on a very uneven trajectory. One moment you think he is going to be the hero, the next, the villain. If you had to sum up the character in one word, you would be hard pressed to decide between tortured and broken.The only critique I could give is that the soundtrack sounds like a mix of movies you have already seen, from Inception to Tron Legacy, sometimes it is a distraction and does not mend well with the scenes as they are playing out on screen.Only God Forgives is not a movie for all to enjoy, as some will get lost in the artistic feel of it and others bored with the theater like performances. However those who will find it entertaining, will not soon forget about it.",Only God Forgives
291,toinou328,"An atmospheric tale of revenge, and not the sequel for Drive",7,24 May 2013,"Critics have gone way too hard on this movie. Lots of violent, strange et slow films have been presented at the Cannes film festival since its creation but yet every time a film pushes the boundaries of violence while keeping its own style, most critics go mad and sometimes shout at the screening, even leaving the theater before the end and calling it ""outrageous"". This film, along with ""Anti-Christ"" is a perfect example of the type of scandals that go on at Cannes for quite stupid reasons.First of all, forget about Drive. If you know Nicolas Winding Refn's style and like it then you'll enjoy this movie but if you've only seen Drive and believe this is going to be in the same style (because of the same actor, similar cinematography, same musical style...) believe me you'll be disappointed. The trailer might give this impression, but this film is very different. The director had already made other movies just like this, but they did not encounter a really large audience. His works were mostly known by cinephiles, artsy people and intellectuals interested in film analysis (in a general way of course). Drive was his first really big success and also his first film taking place in America, starring a worldwide known star (Gosling) and going deep into its message while keeping a more specific style than his other films. Here Refn feels a lot more philosophical, and comes back to his original style in directing films such as Valhalla Rising : great visuals, slow-pasted action, scenes that seem a bit detached from one-another, deep character development, little dialogue, extreme violence mixed with soft and/or trance-electro music... all of which are here to deal with philosophical, deep, hard subjects like revenge, good and bad, mother/son relationship etc...When it comes to the acting Gosling does not disappoints however this time Refn wanted to do the opposite that he did in Drive : showing the weakness of his character. Also, even though he does pull-off a very convincing performance, Kristin Scott Thomas is surprisingly captivating and gives her character a much more ""real"" dimension than it could have been (like it is most of the time, when a woman is supposed to play a drug-lord badass). But saving the best for the end, Vithaya Pansringarm, an actor totally unknown to me until know, plays wonderfully his role as the mystical bad guy, and really did surprise me by the quality of his acting. He completely understood the movie's atmosphere and makes his character feel mysterious and fascinating.To sum-up this is a very atmospheric, deep movie with great actors/actresses and dealing with difficult and serious themes, with some philosophical analysis possible, but definitely not in the same style as Drive, even though it has some similarities with it.",Only God Forgives
292,yaldish,"If you love cinema, you'll love this - 8/10",8,31 May 2013,"I do understand why people hate it, that also means that I understand why people love it because I am one of them.This movie was shot by cinematographer Larry Smith who also worked with Kubrick on 'Eyes wide shut', he made an extraordinary job shooting this picture because it was mesmerizing and beautiful to watch from the beginning to the end. It was also an amazing movie experience, it's one of those movies that you just give yourself over to. If you are a fan of movies and a fan of Nicolas Winding Refn then I think you will absolutely love this. I read that a lot of people are complaining about this movie being thin on story and whatnot, well, let me put it like this; if Refn wanted a ""story"" he would give it a ""story"". He doesn't have anything to prove on that point because he already showed us that he can do it if he wants to, and I think once you let go of that then it will be a lot more easier to enjoy and experience this movie because it is a movie that is based on ideas which is clearly what Nicolas Winding Refn is focusing on rather than having a moving plot or story.The atmosphere in this movie was really something, it was almost as if you were a part of it thanks to this movie being very slow paced, and that's why I've always been a big fan of slow-paced movies. ""Chang"", who is ""God"", was so coldblooded that even I as a viewer felt that it will be impossible for ""Julian"" to actually try to kill him - and then that last fighting sequence came. All the actors did a very good job and gave convincing performances, meaning that they didn't have to do more than what was already in the film. And I loved the fact that our protagonist got beaten down to a point where we couldn't see his normal face, and I liked the relationship that Julian (Ryan Gosling) and Crystal had (Kristen Thomas) because I could feel that strange mother-to-son love type of relationship even though it was very tense, that probably has to do with good chemistry between the two actors. This movie also had very good soundtracks which added another great layer to it. I guess if David Lynch were to make an extremely violent movie, I think it would look something like this, there were indeed some Lynch-moments in there and some Kubrick shots which I absolutely loved. As much as this movie made me cringe I could not stop enjoying it, it was all in a positive way. I think Refn at one point called this a Thai-western about a man who is fighting against god, and I couldn't stop thinking about that whilst I was watching it because that's exactly what it is.People can trash this movie all they want, we even had two people walking out of the theater. But the fact that some critics gave it a 100/100 and others gave it below 50/100 should tell you a lot. But at the end of the day, I think if you really want to know what you think of this film, you will have to go and see it for yourself.",Only God Forgives
293,Havgar,"Slow, so slow",5,24 May 2013,"If you've seen Drive, then you should know that this movie is nothing like it, except perhaps in the fact that they are both beautifully shot. Drive had a pretty brisk pace, good dialogue, a plot that went somewhere, and a likable character.Only God Forgives had none of that. This is a movie which moves along at a snail's pace, and even at a runtime of 90 minutes, it feels like many hours go by before even a single thing happens. Even the characters move and turn slowly.The plot, such as it is, you would probably find worth watching, but Nicolas Winding Refn peppers it with pseudo-dream sequences and many pointless scenes that drag on for ever, so that the plot becomes hard to stay interested in.Now, some things you might care about.The acting. Ryan Gosling, of whom I was a fan in his earlier days, plays the same character from Drive, except that here he is indeed even more emotionless. He speaks about 5 lines during the whole movie, and has fewer different facial expressions. Kristin Scott Thomas is very good, although she feels underused. She is definitely the strong point of this movie. Vithaya Pansringarm, who plays a prominent role in the movie, is as expressionless as Gosling, although he is somewhat better, in my opinion.Action scenes do exist, and they do resemble those from Drive, in that they are very matter-of-factly and visceral. Here, Winding Refn has really indulged in a lot of gratuitous gore, although overall, I found the action scenes quite entertaining. One particular one showcases Byron Gibson's acting talents, and it is particularly (and hilariously) cringe-worthy.All the characters in this movie are unlikable. It is extremely difficult to get yourself to care for any of them, including Gosling's, who is arguably the protagonist here.Aside from Scott Thomas' acting, the only other redeeming quality of this film is the excellent way in which most scenes are set up and shot. The sets, the camera movement, the placement of the actors, all of these make up for some truly gorgeous shots.Overall, sad as I am to say it, I cannot recommend seeing Only God Forgives.",Only God Forgives

296,xyz72,A hypnotic journey between Kubrick and Lynch,10,22 July 2013,"Only God Forgives is not a movie in the traditional Hollywood blockbuster sense. It's also not your usual crime movie. And it most certainly was not made for your average 08/15 American audience. Instead, it's a hypnotic, impressionistic journey full of stunning cinematography that flawlessly fuses a powerful musical score with visual silence. Instead of praising the film to hell and back, let's look at some of the common complaints I hear about it: ""It's boring/slow"" - well, maybe your patience is just severely lacking. The slow pace is a style of it's own rather than a positive or negative aspect. At times the film reminds of 2001 - also a movie that was slashed by critics for being pretentious and slow upon release. ""I can't sympathize with the main character"" - why should you? Why would you want to sympathize with a drug-dealing, violent, f-cked up character? Not every movie's goal is making the viewer identify with the characters. Despising the characters is equally valid. ""Gosling is an awful actor, he barely does anything"" - no. Understated acting can be(and often is) much more powerful than a more in-your-face approach. And it certainly was appropriate in this film. ""The plot is too thin"" - that is just judging all film by the same standard. This movie has a strong abstract layer to it, telling a story is not the main purpose.I would rate it a 9/10. However, I have given it 10/10 to improve the IMDb rating slightly. Don't let reviews keep you from watching this film. Watch it, then complain later if you didn't like it.",Only God Forgives

This a film solely for Nicolas Refn and no one else. Apparently he just wanted to go to an Asian country and make a film there.What a disappointment, especially after the excellent ""Drive"".

Rife with beautiful cinematography in a neon lit yet coldly engaging world and a zoning electronic score, Only God Forgives shows director, Refn's European sensibilities returning since his last film, Drive. This bloody violent film is stocked with symbolism and at times perplexing philosophical/psychological currents.

Let's be honest, the cinematography, lighting, set design, costume, sound design, you name it are perfect. Every shot is flawlessly framed and blocked. And yes, the acting may have been a little drab, but what was there to lose with that?

Then when there is action, half of the time it's in slow motion.I'm well aware that the moviemaker was trying to create a neo-noir, atmospheric, cool piece of cinema, but in my opinion all it did in this case was to irritate.The critics have given this film an average of 4.5 rating, and this is one case where I completely agree. I don't recommend seeing this in a theater. Rather, use a setting in which 1) you're not wasting money; and 2) you have a remote-control in your hand.

But Winding Refn surrendered substance and depth for style. The plot is underdeveloped and it doesn't leave much room for any emotional impact. It's a very violent film, even much more than Drive, but the violence doesn't bring any added value, it merely serves entertainment purposes. This certainly won't win any major prizes in Cannes although it may have a very small chance at the best cinematography prize there but I suspect that will go to either Sorrentino's 'La Grande Bellezza' or 'Inside Llewin Davis' of the Coen brothers. The acting performance of rising Canadian star Ryan Goslin is again very solid with very little dialogue. I was less fond of Kristin Scott Thomas in one of the other lead roles. The characters could have really been better developed. It's a very moody, stylish crime story that's too artistic to be just called a genre film, that (plus the slow montage) could be a problem when this plays in mainstream cinema complexes where people with a limited attention span won't like this.

I can imagine when looking on any meta-review site that the results will be around the 5.0 section, as 50% watching this gave it a ten, and 50% giving it a 0. I should begin by telling you, I was in the first 50%. The film starts off somewhat slow, building up to its first shock moment. Although the shock moments do come in dribs and drabs, the visual style, never lets up. It is always interesting. The score is somewhat lacking for a movie with a character and his 17 lines, the score doesn't quite live up to the tension it wants to create. The dialogue is very concise, nobody saying anything that they don't need to. Something that appeals to me from my personal love of the 'dollars' series. It is very ambitious in how well- developed the characters can become from extremely minimal dialogue. To the film's credit however, it achieves this. The acting is for the most part up to scratch. To which, it is very interesting to see the way that each characters presence in the scene, does make a large difference, something not often found in modern movies. One thing that stands out in terms of audience appeal, is that this is an art-house movie. Incorrectly mainstream released, it is for those art-house fans out there. The film's cinematography and moody style is what carries it, but with this level of risk, maintaining an audience's attention is like walking on a tightrope, over a volcano, and the rope being made of butter. It's very risky, but with a sustained attention span you will appreciate and enjoy Only God Forgives. Winding-Refn hasn't quite lived up to the level of shock, intrigue and tension that Drive had, but even if this movie is half the movie that Drive is, it's still going to be pretty awesome.Final Verdict: B-If you LOVED Drive, you'll LIKE Only God Forgives.If you liked this and want to see more, check out the blog I originally wrote it on.

307,ngmb,Misunderstood,7,18 January 2014,"This film does has it's flaws I agree, but it is generally very misunderstood because most of the people who didn't enjoy thought they were watching a generic movie, when it was everything but that.I am going to start by explaining a few things:1. Chang (the Thai cop) is supposed so be a living representation of god. That is the reason he goes around declaring justice, deciding what someone's punishment should be and whether or not they shall be forgiven. It is also the reason he can pull out a sword seemingly from nowhere and has somewhat supernatural capabilities.2. Ryan Gosling's character (Julian) is not supposed to even be a character. He is a vessel for the story to move along.3. The story isn't told through dialogue like most movies, it is instead told through the visuals. Things like Julian always staring at his hands, and the scene in which blood comes out of the tap etc. are all somewhat essential to the story.Now I agree the film has problems, It is very slow and can be unentertaining, but for most people to write it off as being a terrible sequel to drive don't understand that this movie isn't attempting to be like drive. Drive was more of a generic simple movie. This is absolutely not.",Only God Forgives

It seems that there are so many talented directors and actors wasting good films to fulfill the needs of violence junkies who want more and more repugnant imagery. In this film, you witness someone slicing an eyeball and a son eviscerate his own dead mother. It's pointless and depraved. Drive had some shocking violent imagery too, but I felt it was kept in check. In this movie, it was as if they had to add some abhorrent gore scenes to appease money-hungry producers and a desensitized fan base whose addiction to violence only grows more perverse.The movie has its merits, but the violence is sure to turn off most viewers.",Only God Forgives
309,AukeBriek,Unjustly booed away at Cannes,9,26 May 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn's new feature, Only God Forgives is a good film, his best offering I've seen so far. This is not only style over substance, but (like Spring Breakers) also style as substance. A grim mood is created through long stretches of brooding red lights reflected on faces, while the violent outbursts seem to be discharges of visually overcharged surroundings, with electricity built up after long silences with lots of eye candy, stylized framing and an exciting electronic/ambient score by Cliff Martinez. All of this underlines the desires, motivations, and emotional experiences of a bunch of messed up characters. So you could say that, the mood and the meaning are meant to be ""the residue"" of the style, just as Korine explained his intention for Spring Breakers. This is why both films are not empty stylistic offerings, but resonate on a deep affective level. And, because a non-narrative substance can be incorporated into the style, to pursue the ideal of style over narrative substance is not superficial per se. What is also positive, is that unlike Drive (and Bronson), the narrative substance that remains is not messy per se, just lightweight. Although the story is quite simple and pure in execution, it is certainly strange, abstract, and a little drawn out. Especially the beginning relies mostly on mood, leaving little time for traditional story-telling. This worked for me, but I can understand that many others find it tedious. There is a lot of ambiguity, mostly having to do with the mysterious motivations behind Gosling's character. He has the same elation on his face as in Drive, but more perverted and strange this time. Apart from this there are a few abstract/absurd elements in the story: for instance, certain characters meet each other in paradoxical and inexplicable ways. But to me this was more a matter of deliberate ambiguity and mystery than messiness. The film is also extremely violent. Not constantly, more like a series of intense hits after long silences. This is not primarily used to entertain or bludgeon the viewer, but more to convey the moral conflict going on in Gosling's character. And the final scene may have felt completely weird and ridiculous to many people (I heard much laughter in disbelief), but to me it made perfect sense, albeit in an absurd way, because it seemed to be the only resolution to the conflict going on in his mind. The song at the end just felt like the perfect continuation of the beautiful absurdity just before it.",Only God Forgives
310,jonathan_maroon,Disappointing even for a Refn Film.,5,29 September 2013,"After I watched the movie Drive. I was blown away that movie is a 10/10. I was really pumped for this movie after finding out both Nicholas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling would be returning to do another movie. While I watched the movie, I was enjoying it to a certain extent. I thought the visuals were mesmerising and the soundtrack was amazing. However the story is messy.I know that in this movie all the characters are like metaphors. Like the ""police officer"" was a metaphor for God and Ryan Gosling's mother was a metaphor for the devil. The two of them were acting as a ""conscious"" for Gosling.However I was bored while watching this movie. I thought the acting was sub-par. especially Gosling's lack of dialogue. I may be on my own here but I blame the problems of this movie on director Nicholas Winding Refn.Overall I recommend seeing this movie as it will divide viewers.5/10",Only God Forgives
311,leedirectsmusicvideos,Visually stunning with uninspiring plot and story left me feeling unimpressed and disappointed,6,25 September 2013,"First off there were some great things about this film. Mainly the cinematography, lighting, and score of this film was phenomenal! However, I walked away from this film being largely unimpressed. The subject matter was great, but by the trailer you are lead to believe Ryan Gosling is going to be a boss and do some epic revenge against his foes. Yet, he gets owned in this movie and actually says very little dialogue. I was not a fan of the movie and I thought it to be very long, drawn out, and slow. The acting was on point by all the actors, but I just did not like this movie. I love the director's work, because Drive is an absolute masterpiece! I could give you a truly in depth review of why this movie failed to impress me, but I would rather save all those words and just give you my opinion instead. Its OK I will forever love Nicolas' work as a director though. When he gets behind the camera his films become art like art house pictures. The acting was superb, but I just did not like the way Julian fails in the movie. I think I get it since he was playing an anti hero in this film, much like Drive where he was also an anti hero. I just hope that the next film Nicolas does it will be far more superior. Its not a horrible movie and I think its worth watching, but you just have to be prepared for a possible let down. I love Nicolas and his work using the Arri Alexa which is such an amazing digital HD camera.",Only God Forgives
312,tonydominguez2,"Seriously, What the F***!!!",1,10 August 2013,"I've read magazine articles and other online reviews about this film and they have all shared the same premise. A brilliant film along the lines of Drive (which I enjoyed greatly).This film isn't on par with that but maybe Sharknado (which I gather is cra*). But unlike Sharknado, this film does take itself seriously. What reasons can I give you to avoid this pretentious waste of life. To start it's sooo slow and even when the pace picks up it's still at the coma rate. The character's have no story to tell and seem to be there just to fill screen space. Ryan Gosling is a good actor but I dare you to watch it and count how many words (not lines) he says in the entire film. The other actors aren't worth mentioning and to finish while some of the retribution scenes don't make up for this P*** poor excuse of a film.Am I bitter? YES!!! I had great expectations for this film and have wasted my Saturday night watching this!!!Waste, sorry watch this film at your peril!!!",Only God Forgives
313,pepestealth,what to say,5,28 July 2013,"If you liked Drive, Bronson and Valhalla Rising....don't expect anything like that of "" Only God forgives "", what can you say about this movie. the script is kinda OK, the acting brought to the table by Kristin (Crystal) is the only thing that saved the movie, for me that is...It actually made me want to see it through till the end...The movie was well shot as a static, artsy kinda thing...but overall to me it seemed like the movie was edited by an editor who didn't know his job...sadly. The pacing of the movie was not there...it was Slow...so slow...It's sad to say as I expected so much of this movie after having seen most of Refn movies, but alas...this one was disappointing to say the least. Ryan (Julian) had me with his fragility but somehow brought nothing but a weak and unlikeable character to the screen. And why did he cut his own mother after she got killed by Chang and put his hand inside her...???? Vithaya(Chang) was this still, moving but static, nearly mute character with a God complex, reaching for his ninja-like blade as if if by magic appearing from behind his back ??? He figured he could just kill and mutilate anyone to his pleasing as if he had the right to do so. I do understand things in Thailand go differently, but seriously....not like that.Did I mention the movie was incredibly slow, like really slow. no matter how well shot the movie was the editing was done without heart. Especially in the back-end of the movie as if it had to be rushed of to a quick ending.... and the long and mute shots just felt forced and too wannabe art-house. The graphic nature of the violence was hard and realistic, too much if you ask me for this kind of movie.the movie was well shot, bad edited and overall too slow, even thou it last only for an hour and a half. Kind of weird if you ask me. I've personally seen movies lasting over two hours and not making me want to leave the Theatre but this one seriously had me wanting to leave after only 30 min. in.So to re-cap I'm very sorry to say I would not recommend you seeing this slow movie",Only God Forgives
314,SerotoninMCMXCI,An acquired taste,7,5 August 2013,"Don't go into this one expecting a conventional film with a conventional point A to point B plot. This is a film high on imagery and low on dialogue. The actors express emotions mainly through facial expressions and body language. It reminded me a lot of the directors earlier film ""Valhalla Rising"" as both gave off the same vibe to me, there's also a similarity between the two with the striking imagery and violence. Another film it reminded me of in tone was ""Vinyan"", and all three share a lucid dream like quality. The performance's are all good, in particular Kristin Scott Thomas as Julian's unforgiving mother, and I have to mention the score which was fantastic, one of the best i've heard in a while.I think this will inevitably be a polarising film, which will go over many's head's. There were a fair few walkouts in my screening and when the credits rolled there were many laughing, seemingly out of bewilderment. I got the sense 50 to 60% of them were expecting ""Drive 2"". There are no definitive good or bad guys here, they are all guilty of something, and there isn't really any likable characters in the film either. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it is something else I think will turn off a lot of people. Refn has made no attempt to appease the audience in this film and in this instance I'm fine with that. This seemed to me like a kind of passion project for Refn , which I think he earned after delivering a film as good as ""Drive"". The only thing's I really disliked was some of the overt symbolism in the film, which I think should of been more subtle, and the ending which left me a little unsatisfied. Despite this I think this is going to be a film which warrant's and reward's repeat viewing's. I've thought about this film more than i've thought about most other film's i've seen this year combined, which indicates to me this a thoughtful and meaningful film and not the, hollow, pretentious piece many seem to have branded it. I can't say i'd recommend this film to everyone and I admit it is probably an acquired taste, but I for one enjoyed it.",Only God Forgives
315,jonathan_lh95,"Very artistic, may be boring and uncomfortable for many",6,9 September 2013,"You know when a film is going to be special when it's booed at the Cannes festival. But it isn't all due to Refn's work; he just forgets to offer a decoder along with it. The self-claimed pornographer has created a film that indulges itself in violence, sexual intensity and ambiguity, catering only to the selected few that are either actually artistically cultured or are pretending to be artistically cultured.Similar to Drive, it stars Ryan Gosling as Julian the emotionally scarred older brother of Billy (Tom Burke) who's murdered by the father of the 12 year old girl, who he brutally raped and killed. Julian then sets out to avenge his brother but spares Billy's killer when he discovers what Billy had done and that judgement day's advocate, a policeman named Chang was involved. However, the domineering mother and empress of a drug empire isn't so empathetic and condones the actions of Billy and demands the killers head ""on a f?*@ing platter"". Although soon to come, her actions will be judged and Chang and his merciless blade will be at the ready.The story has a melodramatic style in a sense that the tempo is slow at first and then there's action...then it's slow... then the action etc and to be fair for some reason it worked well in Drive, but it didn't have the same stimulating effect in this film but was actually draining. Refn has created more of ""art noir"" film and to some extent this has made it difficult to follow; along with the sensitive topics he's chosen to explore, to no surprise has alienated the mass consumer and forced them, no ""us"" to experience an awkward encounter of strange, domineering sexual fetishes and inevitable violence. The only aspects of the film that were appreciated and convinced me that it had potential were the contrasted colouring of the tinted of red and black (representing blood, darkness or something else only Refn knows) and the daring one- liners like ""do you wanna fight?"" Perhaps I'm one of the few that aren't artistically cultured enough to appreciate this particular film, which is probably the basis of my response at the end of the film being equivalent to at the beginning...bemused.",Only God Forgives
316,Movie_Going27,Only God Forgives ultimately is an incomplete film,6,27 October 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn's last film, Drive, took a lot of audiences by surprise in 2011 who had not taken notice of his more independent released films. In Only God Forgvies Refn once again trusted Drive's Ryan Gosling as the lead of the film, a gritty look at a world set in Thailand where Gosling trains Thai boxers. As of late Gosling has been on a stellar rise becoming in many eyes the most talented actor of his generation but here his character stunningly is very vapid and almost non-existent. The surrounding aspects of the film including intense violent scenes and over the top performances by his castmates does not blend into a cohesive film. His quiet and stoic lead performance falls flat up against the rest of the film and drags the energy down every time he is on screen.If you are familiar with Drive some of the visual eccentricities return to this film but are even enhanced during most of Only God Forgives. The color palette ranges between reds, pinks, blues, greens and neons of all sorts. The scenes that take place at night (which is most of the film) feature Ryan Gosling's character Julian in shades of all of these colors. The film revels in this strange color choices but it rarely enhances the film as the characters are not interesting enough to let the visuals breathe into them. His visuals make the world of Bangkok obvious rather than mysterious or exploitative. If the characters mattered more to the audience the visuals would be a welcome break from the ruthless violence and characters who all lean towards cruel or without empathy.Refn's visual style of neon bright lights and hazy visuals are implemented into a story of a battle between two distinct groups. Julian and his mother, portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas, are reunited in Thailand after the death of his brother who raped a young Thai girl. The girls father and the Thai police Lieutenant Chang are targeted by the family because of the brothers death. Lieutenant Chang is played by an actor I have only seen in The Hangover Part II prior to this, and not very memorably. Vithaya Pansringarm in this film however gives a ruthless and exciting performance as a man who is trying to keep everything as calm as possible while still having to watch his own back from enemies that surround his life. The character of Julian is used as a function of mood and angst that does not work withing the course of the film. Chang is the opposite of that as Pansringarm shoots through the screen and seems ready to strike any moment even during a ritual of karaoke which is much more enticing for the viewer. Kristin Scott Thomas also leaps off the screen with an over the top performance of a woman who does not seem very surprised her son has died. The first time the audience is introduced to her character she seems more interested in what type of accommodations her hotel has than anything that his happening in the rest of Bangkok. As Refn's does not allow for many plot twists, the visualized style and characters are what the film hinges on. Scott Thomas and Pansringarm's characters leap off the screen, but the contrast between them and Gosling's character is too much for the film to hold onto and remain interesting. Almost every time the film switches back to Julian it loses momentum finally leading to a inexcusable moment where Julian yells at an escort named Mai (portrayed by Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) who is his only friend. Mai was the one bright spot of his scenes and when he fractures his friendship with Mai the film does not recover.Refn takes chances in his films and that is something any viewer should hope for from artists. His slow moody Valhalla Rising (2009) is my personal favorite of his work but is certainly not for everyone. Only God Forgives takes chances, which is good, but does not come together to make a good film because the characters do not belong in the same film. Much lesser directors have used Ryan Gosling to greater effect, his Julian character in this film could be interesting if Refn had chosen to let the viewer in a little more and had more dialogue. For that reason it feels more like a first or second directorial effort rather than a man coming off his biggest critical hit making his ninth film. Refn and Gosling still have plenty of talent and good work left in both of their careers, but Only God Forgives ultimately was an incomplete film.",Only God Forgives

318,edm-the_red,Disappointing,4,16 November 2013,"Only God Forgives... a foreboding name to match an epic, hyper-violent revenge saga set in Bangkok's criminal underworld. Actually, God is deliberately nonexistent in this movie, and this is for the best, as its characters are nearly entirely unworthy of redemption. I have recently come to appreciate Ryan Gosling, especially his recent efforts in Drive & Gangster Squad. However, his character in this movie is strangely devoid of personality. There is basically no character development, whatsoever, making the ugly twists of the plot almost laughably overbearing. The movie is brutal & extremely violent, but the violence carries no emotional weight and mostly feels unnecessary. The sexual overtones are also ugly and try too hard to be ""edgy"", resulting in a few unpleasantly weird scenes that cross the boundaries of good taste. As unappealing as the story is, you might find it hard to look away: the cinematography is amazing (where did they film this?) and gives the film a fevered, hypnotic vibe. I also liked the accompanying music (??karaoke?? segments aside), it enhanced the atmosphere and intensified key sequences. Arguments could be made for the abstract style of storytelling, but I personally found it too disconnected to be meaningful. Overall, there are some positive notes here, but I don't know if they are worth the grotesque elements and nonsensical plot you must stomach to enjoy them.",Only God Forgives

The result however was not satisfactory, it takes more than a study on sociopathic traits (which literally everybody in the film seems to possess) to make a memorable or at least enjoyable movie.

324,diablopale-41194,"Refn's ""Ryan's Daughter"" - a film hated for its constraints that blossoms with time",9,22 November 2017,"Let me start out in a generic enough way: This film IS NOT ""Drive"". I saw this film the day after I saw ""Drive"", having been compelled to find it based on the former effort's successful weave, and went in knowing that the film has, for the most part, received some awful reviews.I was surprised to find the film not just good, but happily quite powerful. One would think that, this being a continuation of the style that Refn and Gosling explored in ""Drive"", it could lead to a rather dry affair, however this is rarely the case and, on the occasion that it comes off this way, it feels intentional and the film makes the experience smooth. Those with patience may love this film.Complaints of the film's pacing are well-enough-founded, however the argument that this stylistic choice suffocates the narrative simply isn't true. Think back to Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (one of my favourite films and a film that, I might remind you, holds an 8,6/10 on this site). Refn called the film a western set in Bangkok and I can certainly agree with him.Gosling's acting may seem to be a problem for some. It is true that his character is quieter than Edward Scissorhands (a reported 17 lines only), but it would be helpful to go into the film with his mentality on the character of Julian in mind (he compares Julian to a video-game avatar which I find appropriate and was able to use to channel my emotions into the story).The film is dedicated to Alejandro Jodorowsky, but has heavy lineage in the films of David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick (""Eyes Wide Shut"" in particular: Kubrick had a similar mentality towards making his lead someone that the audience should imprint their emotions on, and ""Only God Forgives"" shares cinematographer Larry Smith; but there is also at times a bit of ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""). The film may be beautiful to some, while others will find it excessively dark and the colours radical and fake-looking (a speciality, it seems, of Larry Smith). And while the film is drenched in metaphor the story is not without merit: Harking back to silent films where characters with the motive of surviving in their strange worlds is much more prevalent. The character of Chang was, in a negative review, complained about for lacking menace; however I found in my experience that Chang was attempting to survive the consequences of his literal form of justice, just as Julian attempts to find himself free of his mother.A section of note is the soundtrack: a fantastic thing. Those who claim it to be the film's only strength may however need to be reminded that Hitchcock would not release ""Psycho"" until he saw it with Bernard Herrmann's iconic soundtrack. It works the same magic here.Ultimately, this film is not easy to watch. Though possibly less graphic than ""Drive"", an air of violence hangs in the air, the characters are not easily likable and need to be 'found' by the viewer and the pacing may put some off. All I can say is that it worked for me and maybe it deserves another look.",Only God Forgives

The film then rolled through to the death of a young woman, cut out, and the lights came on. It then restarted from the beginning. A fitting start to a bizarre movie.The cinematography is perfect, the soundtrack is beautiful. It felt so much like SE Asia, like being there. The acting is so subtle as to almost not be there. Most of the cast sit like porcelain dolls, barely breathing or moving unless it's part of the story.The story... is not important. Drugs, sex, violence, revenge, it barely matters. If you try to follow the plot you'll find yourself angry and impatient with this movie. It takes us half the film to just figure out who the good and who the bad guys are. And even then, it is ambiguous to the end, which had me swearing in anger, annoying those around me. As the lights came back on I hated this film, and cursed the people who made it, but at the same time, felt profoundly touched in a way that was almost indecent.Every scene is hard, brutal, brilliant, and cut like a diamond. The lack of expression in most of the characters becomes a form of art, where a single breath starts to tell a whole story.Go and see this movie because it will make you feel anger, pity, shame, desire, confusion. If you want a simple tale of love and conflict, or explosions and gadgets, forget it. But if you have ever been drunk or in love in the wrong country, caught on the wrong side of a confusing situation, or in fights where you lost badly, you will adore this movie for its insane, beautiful, crazy staging.",Only God Forgives
329,Sergeant343,Overly Ambitious,5,22 July 2013,"The film reunites famed Danish Director Nicolas Winding Refn and Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling to muddling effect. The film takes place in Bangkok where Julian(Gosling) runs an underground drug ring in a Muay Thai fight-club with his brother Billy(Tom Burke). Soon Billy is murdered and Julian looks to find his brother's killer only to discover that Billy murdered an underage sex worker, from then on it is more his mother(Kristin Scott Thomas) hunting down the killers. The actors in this movie do the best they could given that like most Refn films is mostly visual and sound than spoken dialogue. Kristin Scott Thomas is by far the star of the show, though that could be because her character is the only written with emotion. Ryan Gosling turns in a mostly quiet performance, but when he snaps like in ""Drive"" he manages to be frightening and has a degree of unpredictability in him. The rest of the performances were fine and characters with certain trait just there for visual effect. No where is this more apparent than with a police captain named Chang(Vithaya Pansringarm) who has an affection with the sword and cuts off the hands of those who murder others(blood on their hands) and sings karaoke afterwards.The cinematography is done by Larry Smith who worked on films such as Barry Lyndon, Shinning, Eyes Wide Shut, and was the cinematographer for Refn's Fear X and Bronsan. With all that said this his best work to date. The allure of this movie is intoxicating and thick, with every shot of this film having something to analyze and is yards and away the best thing about the film. It is one of the most beautiful films all year and does what it can to draw you into the depraved world of sex and violence Refn has envisioned. Props also must go to the production team as well, for several of the sets in the film are highly intricate and fit the setting well, matching the theme of red running through the picture. The soundtrack by Cliff Martinez matches perfectly the haunting mood the film is going for, with soft beats and mostly being atmospheric it makes the visuals that much better and is an example why he is one of the best working today.With all of that said the film fails, because with all of its stylized beauty there is nothing there and its detachedness comes off of it making the audience not care what happens to the characters in the end. This is a fault of Refn's direction, for he is trying to tell something visually and make it have meaning, but the visuals are so abstract that he is grasping at air. What works in films like Inland Empire and Shane Carruth films is that there is a story to care about, there are characters that are relatable and that we want to know what happens to them eventually. Here the style of the film suffocates out anything and just becomes a stylized movie about violence and sex without any greater meaning to it or something to make it worthwhile. The editing in this film also sometimes makes it hard to tell what is happening in the head of the characters and what is not and how would some characters know of a character they have not met yet, the entire process feels messy. If the film focused on something other than its style the film would have been the better for it.""Only God Forgives"" is a rare miss-step in Refn's career. Perhaps further viewings would prove to be more fulfilling, but as of now it is empty. The film is still worth a watch, for the visuals alone and or if you are a fan of the director's previous work(not just Drive) and Alejandro Jodorowsky(who the film is for).2/4 Stars",Only God Forgives
330,abengfield,only GOD forgives...,8,2 December 2013,"So i watched Only God Forgives today...not sure where to begin. The film itself is, when stripped down and the ""cover"" plot is looked past, a film about a man wanting to fight god, and also wanting to be forgiven. Julian (gosling) is a cold character and this is because he is a product of the world he lives in, he is almost void of all personality except regret. His mother has control over him (this is also represented in the camera work as the frozen pacing literally translates how Julians world is frozen because of his mothers control over his life) and Julian has not been able to have a relationship with another person because of this (he does have visions, or daydreams of it but he cant do it in reality) and this explains why he is so blank at time. He is constantly staring at his hands, but he is doing so in disgust and again regret because of something he did in the past. ""God"" is represented or played by Chang, who on numerous occasions forgives and punishes people, and his ability to just ""know"" things (watch the film, you will see) is stupidly quick and has to be because he is god-like. There are so many other deep elements to this film with the direction being brilliant and leaves you in a trance.

332,sephev,People are missing the point,9,26 July 2013,"It's a shame that people seem to be missing the point behind this film. However, on one's first sitting, it's easily done - Refn's style and pace may fool you into thinking this is a dull, slow film. The long, seemingly unending shots of actors staring into the distance may make you question Mat Newman's (the editor) talent. But what you really need to do is to look deeper into the film, because behind the extreme violence, the beautiful cinematography & production design and questionable reality, there is an interesting message. That message really depends on how you interpret the film, and differentiates from person to person.For instance, Vithaya Pansringarm's character can be perceived in a variety of ways - a silent angel out to balance the injustices of his city, a delusional man who thinks of himself as God, or a vengeful cop who is simply out to do his job. Ryan Gosling's Julian can be seen as a confused soul who is out to avenge someone he clearly despised, someone who is bullied into action by his persuasive mother. Kristen Scott Thomas's excellent portrayal of Crystal, Julian's thoroughly unpleasant mother, acts as a wedge between the two of them. And the motives of each of these characters are questionable throughout.It's certain that Refn's ninth feature film is not a simple crime drama as you might have expected. Its twists and turns will almost certainly surprise you, and it will linger on your mind long after the credits roll. It makes you question what was real and what was not in a way I've never seen in cinema before. And it really is a shame that a lot of people seem to completely miss the brilliance and genius behind it.",Only God Forgives

I read the critics and not believing completely on them, I decided to check it out. An almost empty theater on its first week in Europe, not a good sign. After a few minutes and not so much talk the violence starts, rated [-18], it was expected to be extremely violent! I counted 10 people living before the 1:30h of empty graphic violence and a inert Ryan Gosling. The killings are to be compared with Friday the 13th, ridiculous. It was worthy through! We've left the theater LOL on Ryan Gosling's faces (or just one face the entire movie), wondering if he chooses to act on speechless movies, simply because he can not memorize his lines, poor boy.Just one critic (movie parliament) was kind with the director and its awful attempt to recreate Old Boy and Kill Bill. To compare it with Irreversible, and Fight club, was too much through! This movie is empty. It does not make us feel sorry, disgusted, revolted or anything at all.

OK, so some films are weird, but this just seems to be weird for weirdness sake.Sometimes you get people who are quiet & don't say much, but when EVERY character in a film is like that it gets very tedious. The lack of any kind of recognisable plot should also have given me the heads up.I'm aware there might be people who go all artsy about this film, but I'm the kind of person who believes that a movie needs to be at least mildly entertaining.

However this film is quite disappointing.The direction, art, music, editing and cast is awesome as always..But the story kills the movie.. Sometimes its too dragged out even for a Refn movie.. pointlessly slow The characters have depth, and the suspense is engaging.. But overall theme is quite ordinary and the script is just bad..So if you can ignore a super slow paced story for almost 90 mins and appreciate everything else in the film you will find this to be a masterpiece.I gave it a 6 because as an overall 'movie' its quite mediocre.",Only God Forgives
337,james-re,One of the most misunderstood films of the decade,10,30 November 2019,"If Drive was the perfect amount of Refns style then only god forgives is him over stepping that line into pure Refn territory. Everything that made Drive what it is has been doubled here, tripled. Characters talk slower, move slower, Ryan goslings has even less dialogue, and the violence is more grisly. Gone are the quick flashes of exhilarating bloody violence from Drive, replaced now with darker grimier moments of violence that are at times hard to watch.While the basic plot may be simple, sequences are drawn out to a point where you start to forget what is actually going on in regards to the plot because each individual scene envelops you with an incredible atmosphere that is sometimes beautiful and other times down right nasty, the nastiness and the beauty often happening right beside each other. The effect in the end is like some vivid nightmare that you want to wake up from but can't help but be entranced by.When I first watched the film I loved some scenes and hated others. I have now seen it multiple times and it's as if it reshapes its self every time, morphing into something different, conjuring up different abstract thoughts each time, different feelings, past feelings, repressed feelings, creative thoughts. Something there is resonating with me deeply. I don't know what it is, but it keeps me coming back. Just the fact that Refn had the bravery and vision to make something like this, to run the risk of it being called pretentious, boring or worse, it's inspiring to me. It makes me feel more confident in taking artistic risks without the fear of what others will think of it. I am truly glad for films like Only God Forgives, and for filmmakers like Refn.",Only God Forgives
338,Youngman_Grand,"Beautiful, blood-soaked, hollow to it's very core.",3,17 May 2014,"This is the kind of movie that provokes a one or five star review and little in between. It doesn't open itself up for much reasonable debate either, since most of the five star reviews contain a sneering disdain for the naysayers, those who it seems should go back to Michael Bay and James Cameron movies, who apparently need plots and characters spoon-fed to them like pablum to toddlers. I think N.W Refyn has targeted this former audience as his key demographic, since I can't quite imagine that every five star review has been written by a viewer who didn't find this a frustrating and disappointing experience, but who feels compelled to try and find the beauty and the meaning which is not elusive but frequently non-existent. As has been repeated ad infinitum, this is a gorgeous and mesmerising visual opus. But visuals are only one aspect of cinematic craft and Refyn has abandoned all other requirements in favour of producing something meticulously crafted by the very best technicians, strikingly beautiful to observe, but without any element of an emotional or moral core. This doesn't result in a dark and brooding fairy tale, it creates a cinematic vacuum where the film simply exists without point or purpose. After the deserved success of 'Bronson' and 'Drive', Refn seems to have retreated back into the makeshift wonderland that made 'Valhalla Rising' such an equally polarising experience. Lengthy, dialogue free stretches make the cardinal sin of not bothering to narrate via coherent images and simply parade endless tracking and panning shots over artfully lit backgrounds, while the minimalist dialogue tries to multi- task by simultaneously filling in character backgrounds, relationships and plot direction - all cloaked in a jargon of silly vulgarity that aspires to Tarantino but falls miserably short. The violent money shots are not exactly shocking, more a necessary punctuation of this contrived dream-scape, and as per usual there is no hero, only a dualistic set-up where both main characters are equally corrupt, both demonstrate their remaining shred of humanity in their response to the crime that brings the two into collision, yet both are neither identifiable nor relatable.Refyn of course fills the picture with ambiguity, looping dreams within dreams, alternating locales and environments with little explanation or sensibility. Not least the bizarre asides where brutal murderers take time out to croon love ballads in karaoke bars. The dedication to Alejandro Jodorowsky articulates perfectly what he is trying to achieve: the gruesome splatter of 'El Topo', the stylised pretension of 'The Holy Mountain' and the maternal fixations of 'Santa Sangre'. Jodorowsky is not a particularly likable filmmaker either, but his films, for all they were a product of their time and artistic culture, abound with ideas and a fascination with the absurd, the ostracised and the mystical. Refyn has no interest in creating anything other than provocative examples of technique - this film fails to operate as a character study, as a depiction of a self-contained and fantastical world or as a revenge-motivated Jacobean tragedy. It doesn't really do much of anything other than retread the portayals of human cruelty that cinema has produced for over a century, albeit with more envelope- pushing unpleasantness. It isn't fun, it isn't engaging, it isn't thought provoking, it isn't an experience. It's a simple exercise in the dry tedium of directorial narcissism; Refyn seems in thrall to his own talents and this is the self-penned hymn that others are expected to pay for.",Only God Forgives
339,jdebra13,"Dark, disturbing, delight",9,20 March 2014,"I really loved the ambition of this film. The ambition Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling to, in the current cinematic climate, try to attempt a film like this I personally think is just brilliant. It's obvious to everyone what kind of films are being made today. What trends ""work"" and are popular and what trends do not. Overall, serious violence, is not something that is very common in mainstream film. At least not like it used to be. But the violence is not what sets this film apart. What set this film apart was the Bangkok that they created. Sure there are some style elements from Drive, but that's just because its the same director. Overall, the subjective, almost hallucinatory style they used was so engrossing. I loved the complicated, contrasting, and contorting emotions this film gave me. Really took me to a strange place. the ""wanna fight"" scene is just pure genius without a doubt. That made the film for me",Only God Forgives

It links many seemingly unrelated things into a powerful metaphor. It reveals something interesting, powerful, and destructive. In that sense (that all is not as it seems) it reminds me of Cervantes and Don Quixote (whose disconnect from reality I always thought was a metaphor for religion and bible stories.) Here we have a few destructive(even psychopathic) parallels - from many forms of sexual abuse (child abuse, incest, and general inability to connect emotionally and sexually - and why) to what i think is metaphor for a life cycle of a not-so -powerful empire. The un-motherly mother could be viewed as a metaphor for a country/empire/Western 'values'. The location is also well picked to provide a good context for all these issues. As in life (and wars) - fighting is not just violence, it's also a form of self-punishment, a failed attempt to heal psychological wounds and a few other things. This story links all these threads (and more) into a powerful explanation and a lesson to be learned.It's like a military/fighting version of Volver but at the same time very different.

343,planthater,Maybe I wasn´t ready at the time for NWR (Review from 2013),7,21 February 2021,"Oh my god he did it again!
After Nicolas Winding Refn disappointed me with ""Drive"", he now goes one step further with ""Only God Forgives"". No idea in which self-referential endless loop Monsieur got caught, or to what extent he wanted to pay tribute to the trash classics of the 80s ... what he delivers here is so dead serious that you want to cry and unfortunately only seems involuntarily funny, varnished and over-the-top. One would think that the contact with overseas was not exactly good for the quality of Refn´s work, just think of the times when the Pusher trilogy was pounded in front of us and you thought: ""Wow, the director really has it! "" At that time the whole thing still breathed the grandeur of European cinema, von Trier and the like peeked around the corner and Mr Refn showed us how modern, brutal cinema works that does not take itself too seriously. Those days seem to be over once and for all. And what I should think of Kristin Scott Thomas' performance has not yet revealed itself to me ... she probably wanted to be filmed really nasty after all the character studies of the last few years ... she should be forgiven. Ryan Gosling is in the same facial sleep mode as always, which is not particularly surprising, but still somehow sad ... I'm sure there would have been a lot to get out of his role, but ok ... At least a few scenes brought a smile on my face, albeit for unintended reasons. Since I was able to enjoy the visual presentation of the spectacle and liked the soundtrack a lot, I give this film 7/10 points. But next time, please again with characters one likes to watch doing their dirty work and less wallowing in the narcissistic and the style-over-substance.",Only God Forgives

Is this not what you wanted? another slow paced, but beautifully shot film that follows a borderline autistic man that embarks on a violent road of retribution. There's so much to love about this film, from its stylish hyper- violence, to its moody lighting (So much red everywhere...it's really lovely) Not a single person in this film is likable, everyone has major problems, Gosling's got that killer, but sexy stare he gives to everyone (even his mother, oh my) and major mommy issues... Pansringarm, even if I can agree with his ways of justice, still reminds me of maniac cop for some reason (funny, because Refn is planning on doing a prequel to maniac cop) and Kristin Scott Thomas is just an enormous c unt, but that's okay, the actors all do a fantastic job at it. There's some to complain about, editing issues, there's some cuts that just seem...weird, i'm just not sure if they were cut that way on purpose or if it was just an editing f uck up. I was also a bit confused if there was some incest going on, so much hinted at it, I just wanted to know if it was present or not ( very minor complaint) you also have those actors that are just..substandard (The English bartender guy for example, those screeches of pain were almost laughable) Overall, a movie obviously not for everyone, I'd still say if you enjoyed Drive you'd probably like this, I loved it, and really I couldn't think of a more satisfying way to end it! 9/10",Only God Forgives
346,Phyxi,... in awe,9,24 July 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" has to be one of the most visually stunning films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Following the success of ""Drive"", Refn's new film has exceeded all of my expectations. While there is much left to desire in terms of narrative, it is easily forgivable. In fact, when faced with such visual spectacle, the narrative barely holds any importance at all. The story is quite minimal, skeletal. It follows the life of Julian (Ryan Gosling), who is a drug- smuggler, in Bangkok. After his brother gets murdered for killing a prostitute, Julian's Mother insists upon revenge for her first-born son. Ever obedient to his Mother, Julian embarks on this quest, despite his moral misgivings. Although he earns money as a drug-smuggler, Julian is quite honorable, which adds a bit of complexity to his character, and to the narrative. While many of us ladies swoon over Gosling's good looks and brooding silence, his acting is so superb. With an innate awareness of the significance of body language, it almost seems as if characters such as Julian are written with Gosling in mind. And, well, perhaps they are. One can see the similarities drawn between Driver (""Drive"") and Julian (""Only God Forgives""), such as the minimal use of speech by these characters, the long pause before speaking, and an ability to make one feel uncomfortable under their piercing gaze. I have to admit that I have always been a great lover of violence in the cinema. ""Only God Forgives"" holds plenty of it. But, the violence employed is beautiful, stunning, a spectacle worthy of adoration. While there is instances that made me want to squeeze my eyes shut, they are filmed so brilliantly that I just had to keep watching. There is no escape from this dangerous, and seedy, underworld; there is no escape for the characters, and none at all for the spectator. Just as the violence is filmed in a spectacular manner, the use of framing, and lighting, are as worthy a mention. While some might feel that ""Only God Forgives"" has a slow-moving narrative for revenge flick, and feel a little daunted by the lengthy silences, I just cannot give this film enough praise. Clearly.",Only God Forgives

This one is the latter.This film was made from a script which could have lasted all of 10 minutes if that... Its full of style/art rather than any substance trying to be way too clever for its own good. The story is so hollow it was never worthy of being made into a film. I was so bored I actually couldn't be bothered to try and understand it. It is the first film in ages I was actively looking at my watch to hope it was nearing the end. By the end most in the pictures were laughing at bits because it was so random and pleased to get out at the end. No doubt countless women will go watch this just because its Ryan Gosling in moody poses without saying much to earn his crust.There are scenes where it is just like the time is being padded out. Like camera following a man walking in the street for 90 seconds only for him to vanish at the end of it - being incredibly pointless. It is so padded out and the talking in it minimal at times. Some of the scenes are so random trying to be too clever for its own good.Honestly one of the worst films I have seen in a long time and I had so much hope for it - don't expect Drive you will be gutted.

348,awkwardmongoose,Neon lights on lucid tiles: solving the mystery behind Only God Forgives,8,19 July 2013,"In may Only God Forgives was premiered at Cannes. Critics appeared to be torn, someone claimed the film to be a masterpiece, the majority decided to put themselves on the slippery slope making comparison with Drive and Bronson. Only God Forgive is about revenge, family loops, jealousy, violence and somehow also about love and takes place in Thailand. I truly believe this is a pretty good film, cinematography is gorgeous maybe the best of 2013 till now, I loved the strong colour blast of neon pink and neon blue cyan, and the way modern lightning was combined with Chinese lanterns. Every scene seemed to be pinpointing thought. The editing was pure poetry. Costumes were great. And Scott-Thomas's performance deserves the Academy nomination for sure. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack, maybe bold but really brave. And here we are to Gosling's acting. His performance is shallow, Ryan dreams and Ryan wants to fight, exactly the same face, he even avoided to blink, until his beaten up eye forced him to wink till the end of the film. I think Julian could have been a great character but Gosling just can't nail it, hoping he will have better luck with his directing experience. Refn confirms himself as a top director with the special gift to explore violence as a state of mind, avoiding rhetorical questions he's able to land to the highest peak of poetry and the lowest ruin of disturbing human behaviour.",Only God Forgives

351,SundayDumbDay,Shhh...there's not much talking in this film..,7,4 August 2013,"This review contains spoilers...I only knew of Only God Forgives because my close friends told me that Nicolas Winding Refn was doing another film and he it had Ryan Gosling. I watched the trailer and I thought, ""This looks really interesting and I must see."" I was an instant fan of Refn from his artistic directing of the movie Drive also with Ryan Gosling and this was sure to be exceptional as well. Only God Forgives was only playing in one theater within driving distance and the last showing was at 9:30pm and I had just under an hour to drive 19 miles and pick out my favorite spot in the theater, which is dead center. I arrived with about 10 minutes to go and I had the entire theater to myself. The lights dimmed and the show began.The opening titles were in Thai and I thought that was kind of cool especially with a backdrop of Cliff Martinez's fantastic score. The story is very simple and the mechanics are equally as simple. Ryan Gosling plays Julien, the Manager of a Thai Boxing Arena and does some dirty business for his family behind the scenes. One night after a big fight, Julien's Brother decides to go out to rape and murder a Thai prostitute. This enrages the Local Chief of Police played excellently by Vithaya Pansringarm. This Police Chief is a scary dude, carrying around a sword that he uses to cut off your limbs if you've been a naughty nancy. Julien's Brother is killed and their Mother played by Kristen Scott Thomas flies out to kill the person responsible. Let's just say that a minor fracas goes down and a few people are ""fatally wounded"". The movie was beautifully shot, but the way Refn and Cinematographer Larry Smith put it together was very Mulholland Dr./ Lost Highway. I love both of those movies very much but it was a little unfortunate that I felt that Refn drew from David Lynch on this one. Be that as it may, the scenes were beautiful and the colors he used were great. My main problem was with the story line, dream sequences and some acting. You have this Police Chief that is just absolutely insane, going around chopping limbs off and walking as slow as Michael Myers when chasing after his suspects.The dialogue was very similar to the aforementioned movies and slightly the same as Drive in the respect that there were extremely long pauses between the characters, almost to the point that I would start to fall asleep. The acting was fantastic from Gosling and Pansringarm, but unfortunately Kristen Scott Thomas fell flat. This was a very artistically made film but ultimately fell short of the mark.See my other reviews at sundaydumbday",Only God Forgives
352,davebamboo,slow motion symmetrical horror film starring waxwork dummies and ugly furniture,1,5 August 2013,"First of all, let me say, towards the end of this film, the sounds of crickets outside my house provided me with some relief from this tedious and mind numbing excuse for a film. Aren't films supposed to be entertaining, for example Fatal Attraction, that was good entertainment, I found myself yearning for so many strange and unrelated things during this film, maybe it is an experiment to challenge the viewers psyche and release any hidden subconscious desires by subjecting the viewer to a bore fest. There is a scene where the camera is pointing at Ryan Goslings face and around his head in the background are three neon strip lights, kind of like a neon crucifix, is that supposed to be symbolic. There is another scene where Ryan Goslings mother has the window frame directly behind her before she gets killed but it looks like a cross. Symbolic?!!! I got it, but I didn't want to get it, I felt defiled. There is an awful lot of symmetry in this movie, where did they buy the wallpaper and the lighting, it was putrid. I don't understand why you need to zoom in and out of hallways, and show different angles of people's static faces which are not speaking and not moving. What is with all the over sized sofas, and everyone sitting around like waxwork dummies, I could make a better movie tomorrow morning between breakfast and lunch using my cellphone, this was a pile of #$*:??g $%&#e. Never have I ever disliked every single character in a movie, all of the furniture, all of the lighting, the expressions of all of the characters at every point in the film, the dialog, the lighting and the furniture again, oh the furniture, this movie has brought out some kind of furniture hatred inside of me. This movie would have been better if it was just product placement all the way through, with no actors and no dialog and no giant over sized sofas. Don't get me started on the karaoke, I missed the symbolism in the karaoke thankfully, if I knew what that meant I feel as though my mind may have been permanently damaged. I might start videoing myself tomorrow walking slowly around my house and staring at myself in the mirror, then try and flog it to a Hollywood studio, chuck in a bit of karaoke, I've got a nice corner sofa that I could use as well, making sure that I sit exactly in the center, with lights on either side and stick some Christmas lights on my head as well, make sure it all looks perfectly symmetrical.

353,debnammc,Forget All of Your Expectations,8,19 July 2013,"To be honest, I'm getting really tired of reading all of the horrible reviews to this movie. It's beginning to look more and more like critics and audiences EXPECT a movie to be a certain way, and when it doesn't fulfill their expectations, there is backlash. I think that the reactions to this movie are a prime example of the trap into which mainstream cinema is falling. If you're expecting to see anything like you've ever seen before, you might as well not even bother watching. But why is shocking and surprising people such a bad thing? Sure this movie is very violent, but I think I've seen PG-13 action movies with more gratuitous/ridiculous violence and higher body counts. Popular action flicks these days glorify violence and make a hero out of those who commit it; that is absolutely not the case here. These people are not really people at all, especially Chang, the character that symbolizes ""God."" Refn dances to a different tune. He doesn't care what anyone expects and to me, it's strangely refreshing. The films he makes are truly unique, and while they may not be up to par with everyone's tastes, you at least have to respect his creativity. In a twisted way, this movie is the freshest thing that will hit theaters all summer.",Only God Forgives

I watched this movie as I enjoy Ryan Gosling movies and Manga / action / gangster movies. If this was a comic book you would be looking for the missing pages. There are no clever twists, just nice cinematography, the story has large holes, the dream sequences are confusing as they are not clear. I read a very detailed review before I understood the whole symbolism of the dream scenes but I would of preferred the movie to do this for the viewer! If I'd of read the reviews first and then watched the movie unusually it would of actually been more rewarding. For instance at no point was it made clear that the Angel of Death was a retired policeman, I actually thought he was another gangster or an ex Thai fighter during the movie, or a Police detective?? I was expecting a clever twist like for instance that his brother hadn't really killed the prostitute and it was a rival gang looking to push them out of business. I thought that the movie might of been based upon a superior comic book story that might explain things better but I haven't found the comic yet.

Ryan gosling's character wasn't only the strong silent type but he didn't say a word, I'm not kidding I think he spoke about 3-6 times in the entire film, there is long brooding silence (like in drive) and then there is this. visually the film was fantastic and I loved the music behind it all but sadly it didn't make up for the poor plot and the non conversation, even when the characters did speak they didn't feel like actual conversations. giving it a four purely for the visuals. I really hope Ryan gosling's next film will be an improvement but this film did him no justice as an actor. padding a film purely with scenes of long hallways, flitting back and forth looks between characters and rooms bathed in pink u.v lighting don't make for good entertainment. I think the only redeeming factor was when Julian's mum was killed at the end, even that was ruined by Julian sticking his fingers into the bullet hole in the wound... I know his mum messed him up but come on that seems a rather far-fetched thing to do to your dead mother! sorry Nicolas but this one was a stinker, still will watch anything you bring out next",Only God Forgives

359,rdinislobo,Inexorable,8,25 August 2015,"This is a slow movie, and not in a bad way. But what I liked the most about it was that it has a certain inevitability. I felt that everything that happened, had to happen. There is no ""if character A had done X instead of Y, the story would be different"". I feel this comes from the fact that there are no heroes or villains in this. And there is nothing to distract you. No forced side- stories, no action movie style fight scenes (combat or guns). The visuals are not what I was used to, but the minimalism (which I believe is very typical of the director, Nicolas Refn) adds to the inexorability of what's to come.Plus if you have a difficult relation with your mother, perhaps this movie can give you a little perspective.",Only God Forgives

Am I supposed to understand what's happening ? These are questions you should completely give up on to be able to enjoy the film. I don't fully understand why people are saying this have nothing to do with Drive because the two movie are actually closely linked and I see OGF as an even more brutal, pure and contemplative version of Drive. The photography is beyond perfect, the atmosphere is magnificent and the action is intense. The pace is really slow and the scenario is lacking originality but it's because the movie has been thank this way, and there is no point in criticizing something the movie obviously didn't care about. It's like criticizing the lack of color in a voluntarily black and white movie. I think this is the reason why it's so hated, it's because it's not a regular movie, it's a one of its kind movie, something you'll probably never see somewhere else. People expectations of a movie are completely different. And because this was the goal, I must admit it's fully achieved.",Only God Forgives

This film is a lot of things, and reading people's reviews, I agree with pretty much everything. The cinematography is excellent. It's a highly contemplative and interpretative film. The performances are enigmatic and committed.But none of it really did it for me. Everything, I think, was a little bit too dirty - so many things felt a little bit out of control. These endless shots of actors staring off into the distance are made problematic by the fact that they often make very little sense. I feel like this film could've done way better on a bigger budget.

But with the lack of any entertaining dialogue and anguishly long shots, this film goes nowhere fast. There is no need for a two minute push into an empty room. At an hour and a half this movie seems like a three hour flick.I don't mind the wooden acting. Hitchcock made masterpieces with wooden actors for years. The story is actually quite simple. The director let's you create the narrative. Also, be ready for gratuitous gore. Where Hitch would leave it to your imagination, it is on full display here.Now, what was great about the movie. It did create a feel with its deathly slow pacing. And the cinematography was rather breathtaking. These are what earned its stars for me.

If IMDb had a 0..that's how bad I would rate this movie..The acting is boring and horrible makes people sleepy I don't see what's the deal with this Ryan gosling... They say he makes good movies..shows up on magazines and such as a great actor and when I watch his movies or should I call it just crap?!?

But then I realised that the majority of the negative reviews were from Americans, for whom blockbusters seem to have become the norm. If you watch this film as it is supposed to be then it is brilliant.Ryan Gosling stated that his character was more a ""vehicle"" in the film and it is from this that we get the best view of what the film is. It isn't full of dialogue or action, but is instead the story of a man's nightmares. Julian (Gosling) is a man trapped between the Devil (brilliant performance by Kristin Scott Thomas) and God (the unnerving Chang - played by Vithaya Pansringarm). The slow walks of the characters and oft-silence is perfectly in keeping with the story, and is superbly backed by Cliff Martinez's soundtrack. Every shot is one taken with great care by Refn - my eyes are still full of the neon and red tint that illuminates every frame.This isn't a perfect film. Even at 90 minutes, it does feel longer, and the script and plot occasionally seem too thin. But I loved this, and applaud Refn for doing a film that he wanted to do, instead of taking up one of the stream of offers that came his way after Drive. Hopefully there's much more to come from him yet.",Only God Forgives

In the middle of the movie).I...can't describe how bad this movie is. It's not ""art"", it's not even particularly striking or disturbing like a David Lynch movie.It's just nonsense for the sake of nonsense, featuring Ryan Gosling uttering all of five syllables and NOT CHANGING HIS EXPRESSION for the entire film.Spoiler alert: the final scene, insane and nonsensical as it may be, is cut off by (you guessed it) yet another scene of a cop singing at a karaoke bar.At that point the entire movie theater I was at got on its feet and left.Laughing.",Only God Forgives

367,karlcoulby,Superb!,10,21 July 2013,"I never write reviews for a film, normally I don't see the point, but this film is absolutely incredible! I completely understand why people don't give it high marks, or rave reviews as they go into it expecting in some ways an easy, traditional film, and this is none of those things... this is film making on an emotional level all the way. What is more important in this film, and what makes it an absolute masterpiece is what is being said in a non linguistic way. And in a crazy way, what is not being said.Allow me to elaborate....1) The non linguistic stuff... The story is mainly told via the colours and the back drop and the way the characters react (or not).... it's a whole lot about the different cultures and the approach to life of the different cultures and a lot of the story in my understanding is driven from an East Asian Philosophy.... this is all about honour and guilt and right and wrong, and emotions... but it challenges you to look at it from a completely different view point to the conventional.2) What is not being said.... this is the motor of the film, There is so much being said that just does not end up in dialogue.... and the critics lose it because they say there is no character development... it misses the point entirely... Ryan Gosling is perfect here because it is all about action and emotion and not showing emotion... it's about the juxtaposition of words/action/emotion.... This film is not made to be heard it's meant to be felt and in this it is a masterpiece.In short I am absolutely blown away by this film, like no other... and trust me, I'm a massive film buff.... I found it to be incredibly complex and beautiful, brilliantly directed and massively deep. I can understand critics.... but I promise you this will be seen as the masterpiece that it is when people look back and see it for what it is.I raise my hat to the Director, he has created a work of genius and his best work yet. LOL if it was not so late when I write this I'd go and watch it again!",Only God Forgives
368,OnZa,The plot is not really there,6,16 June 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" is a dark, serious and ultra-violent movie. It weighs in on Asian symbolism, spiritualism and response to revenge or own hand rights. It flows more like a music video than actual movie (even though it does not have fast cuts). That description also fits ""Drive"" but whereas that movie gained critical acclaim, this one has had way more split response and it's easy to see why.Considering that even with star Ryan Gosling, ""Only God Forgives"" is to be considered a sub-genre movie and indie release, I can predict many people go to see it because of the previous (director & lead star) collaboration ""Drive"". I, like many others marching into movie theater to see it, had high hopes after Drive. I jokingly said that this is ""Drive II"". Well, it's not.Director Nicolas Winding Refn has leaned towards heavy symbolism here, and unfortunately at the cost of plot where one considers how movies should have even a some kind of structure and character development. I had the impression after the movie that tackling the symbolism the writer/director probably thought he had invested more to his characters than he actually has. Gosling is the less spoken man like in the predecessor Drive, but without any likability. The ""heroism"" of the Drive main character could have been argued on but in this case there are no heroes or good guys in the movie. Just a self made perception of each religious or other view.Some reviews said that the movie is style of substance but again (sorry) I need to reference to Drive and question even the style. It had couple of really nice shots and scenes with unique atmoshpere but I found it lacked the coolness. Also the stylisticity (is it a word?) of some the gore scenes only show of a bad taste. In my opinion you're either full on splatter or you're on the other end of the scale, not something in between.This type of story would have been more powerful with some kind of invested emotion. I did not feel about anything when watching this movie. That is what separates if from it's predecessor and also other great movies. Now it's barely good.I am afraid Nicolas Winding Refn have taken a step back here, although I am also pretty sure he does not entertain a thought of mainstream acclaim -that much we've seen from the previous movies. I hope he takes a sidestep for his next movie, and tries something different because he really is talented and an INDIVIDUAL director.",Only God Forgives

Whilst there are certain similarities Only god Forgives is a completely different animal. Ryan Goslings character is expressionless for the duration, in fact the only emotion evident throughout the picture is from Kristen Scott Thomas who was the highlight purely by virtue of being the only actor on screen being required to act.The art-house style features much of what i can only assume to be waking dreams and moves at a pace that would be left eating the dust of any passing snails. It is clear that the protagonist has some pretty deep seated issues with his mother but the directors attempts at exploring this gets in the way of the overall storytelling.I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate this beautifully shot movie but i came out of the cinema confused and with the unwelcome realisation that i hadn't enjoyed the last 90 minutes.",Only God Forgives

Valhalla Rising and Drive are both great movies. The audiovisuals are out of this world and Winding Refn definitely has his own style that isn't for everyone.Only God Forgives is slow, anti-climatic and with beautiful cinematography, great soundtrack and stunning visuals.I find it a bit hard to recommend this movie, because it is not a typical Hollywood movie - luckily...",Only God Forgives
372,rossmoran90,Only God Forgives - Review,7,2 April 2014,"The Drive pair of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn and star Ryan Gosling reignite their partnership in an ultraviolent crime drama.It was inevitable that Refn and Gosling would team up again after the success of their critically acclaimed 2010 hit Drive, and it was even more inevitable that this film would be just as gripping and entrenched in violence as its predecessor. The story takes place in the dark neon-lit underworld of Bangkok, Thailand, and centres around two enigmatic characters, Julian (Ryan Gosling) and Chang, played by Vithaya Pansringrarm. Gosling takes on the same 'strong silent type' that worked for him so well in Drive, but this time his silence and strength is matched by the mystical Chang, whose paths cross after the death of Julian's perverted and sadistic brother and drug-pushing partner, Billy (Tom Burke). The brothers do their illegalities under the cover of their Thai Boxing gym, however Billy's death puts a halt to everything and takes us on a bizarre journey that unravels into mayhem.Chang is the local police detective, but has a more mythical standing in the world he lives in. He is a single parent who leaves his young daughter at home under the care of a young nanny every day with a samurai sword strapped to his back. Chang floats around Bangkok aiming to keep order and respect in his community, but by only knowing one way in doing so, using violence. And by violence I mean hard to watch violence. Chang's immortality and his ease in which he carries out his duties is in godly fashion, however, the goddess figure of Crystal, played by the hugely impressive Kristin Scott Thomas, enters his world and tries to take him on with disastrous consequences. Crystal is the mother of Julian and the deceased Billy, who flies into Bangkok to bury her son, not before orchestrating the revenge of her son's death. The control that she has over her last remaining son, Julian, gives the film another layer, and gives us a better understanding of Goslings character and the reasoning behind his erratic behaviour and trippy dream trance he goes in and out of.Ryan Gosling gives us a performance that won't live long in the memory, but does just enough. He again picks a film that will not please his adoring young female fans, but that is commendable. Since Drive, Gosling has gone down the root of picking films that interest him and not teenage girls, and by doing so he is being taken as a serious actor. His on screen romance, which he is always going to have, is far from conventional, and that love interest is Mai, performed wonderfully by Thai actress Yayaying Rhatha Phongam. His inability to have a conventional relationship with her is brought on by his mother, Kristin Scott Thomas. Scott Thomas gives a perfect performance as the controlling and manipulative mother, whose chilling ice blue eyes really captivate the audience.Nicolas Winding Refn's adept use of colour and lighting are beautiful throughout, and he guides us through the film with ease. The soft-spoken Dane seems obsessed with extreme violence on screen, but controls it expertly, it may be unwatchable at times, and some may say over unnecessary, but it's part of the Refn package, if you can't stomach it, don't watch his films. The cinematography by the British Larry Smith, who worked with Refn on the 2008 film Bronson, is interesting and thrilling, as is the choice of music and production design. To think this movie got booed at Cannes is beyond me, and some of the reviews that critics have given the film are totally bewildering. It's a very interesting film, that takes us on a journey that will really get you thinking, some may leave feeling confused, some queasy, but overall you are treated with respect. Refn respects his audience's intelligence and this makes me question the intelligence of those at Cannes.",Only God Forgives
373,kgosi95,Disappointing but not a hopeless effort,7,20 July 2013,"""Only God forgives"" is the highly anticipated second collaboration between director Nicolas Winding Refn and his golden boy, Ryan Gosling. Here, Gosling plays Julian, the owner of a local boxing club in Bangkok as a front for his drug operation. Following the death of his brother, Julian is pushed by his mother, played by Kristin Scott Thomas to take revenge on the killer. However, as Gosling's character states ""it's a little more complicated than that, mother"" following the emergence of the ruthless cop, Chang(played masterfully by Vithaya Pansringarm).The main strength of this film by far, is the way it looks. The beautiful mix of colours and camera angles turn this film in to a surreal, dream-like experience. Along with the pleasing aesthetics offered by Refn, the performances draw interest especially that of Gosling and Pansringarm's characters, whom both have little dialogue but manage to carry the film through their actions.However, this is by no means, a perfect film. The plot, although initially interesting, appears to achieve nothing and this reviewer, watched the credits feeling rather underwhelmed. Another drawback is that of the unwarranted violence. Unlike Refn's previous effort, Drive, most of the violence in ""Only God Forgives"" serves no purpose. In Drive and many other graphic films, the extreme violence is used to highlight qualities in characters or to create suspense, however, here, it is simply overkill.Overall, this is not a bad movie but it fails to reach the heights that Refn's fans and general viewers will expect. Nevertheless, I would advise at least checking this film out, but be warned, it is not for the light-hearted.",Only God Forgives

375,orchard6,A film that deserves better (A quick review).,8,5 January 2014,"I'll admit that what drove me to watch this film was the internet's sheer disappointment in it. I had seen Only God Forgives mentioned within several ""Worst Films of 2013"" threads and thought to myself, ""Really? The worst film?"" The success of director Nicholas Winding Refn's previous film, Drive, seems to have had a negative effect on Only God Forgives and aided in its chilly reception.Those who enjoyed Drive were excited for another Refn film starring Ryan Gosling, but what they got was something different. A much slower-paced, artsy, and overall uninteresting product. The viewers wanted everything they loved about Drive, and something more. Well, in my opinion, Refn did give us something more, something much more.I'm not going to bother doing a summary of the film but I do want to stress that the characters have much more going on than what is presented at the surface, specifically Ryan Gosling's character. It took me two viewings to fully grasp what was truly taking place.The cinematography alone warrants a viewing of Only God Forgives. Each scene, each shot, is a treat for the eyes. The composition of dramatic colors has always been striking to me; part of the reason I found Spring Breakers so enjoyable. I believe if you watch the film on mute you would still be able to accurately follow the plot; that is just a testament to how well the cinematography compliments the story and characters.This review is more about asking those of you who haven't seen Only God Forgives to give it a chance, pay attention, and look beyond the surface. You may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",Only God Forgives
376,uzeus,Does Mom ever forgive? - An Art-house Beauty.,9,5 July 2013,"Welcome to this Asian western that takes place in modern day hinterland of Bangkok, where the streets have no name and reek of curry chicken and prostitution, yet are not without their underworld that sports a thousand cobra-heads and a demi-god cop out to slash those that dare out of line. This quiet, soft-spoken cop that dispenses justice does so without hesitation or remorse,and with full impunity that becomes a father.Enter two brothers, players in their own right in this underworld, with an abusive mother like no other in the history of motion pictures whose words slither guts and castrate manhood like scimitars.A psychic roller-coaster of Oedipal subtext, a sadistic rendering of art for art's sake. Hands that reach out into dark corridors only to bear the risk of being severed, a phallic morality play almost: in this movie that is so devoid of morality. Hands that will find MOTHER.The shades of dark red and subdued lighting that stand only for the dark recesses of the womb in this (sine qua non) highly atmospheric flick with almost no sunshine. The only daylight scene is the penultimate one where Julian is finally delivered from his mother's womb by the godlike paternal figure of Chang whose exacting justice is very visceral albeit brutal.Oh, what symbolism here, the dead slow pace of the film (which is definitely deliberate) is that of a child in the womb who will imminently be delivered through birth. Julian's release here is the second coming: His manhood is finally freed from the ÜberBitch who is masterfully acted by Kristin Scott Thomas.This modern art-house flick is bold enough to look away from the established threadbare conventions of cinema and challenge the viewer to plunge in an underworld of crime with its rules and reverberations while managing to pass no judgement whatsoever. In so doing, leaving even the fans of the absurd or the surreal out in the cold. Yes, the movie moves towards the inevitable end, however, you are helpless for you cannot take sides as it will not afford you to be partial on face value. There are no emotions on display here, only actions, and consequences. And style over mainstream sensationalism. In which sense, one can draw parallels with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive.Once again, kudos on the great style and cinematography, production design and music, and last but not least, Nicholas Winding Refn for the audacity on taking on the world with what he had to say and how he said it.",Only God Forgives
377,deathdealersteve,Above the level of Masterpiece.,10,31 August 2013,"Only God Forgives is the most touching and personal film I've ever seen. The ways it deals with issues like mother/son relationships are miraculous in the way that even though the plot makes it an extreme example, the feelings of Ryan Gosling and KST just hit so hard that it can give insight and thought to most everyone. People have been only praising this film for it's cinematography/atmosphere and music but the truth is that those things are there and work so well only because of Ryan Gosling and KST, their emotions extend through these mediums because of the skill of the actors and the DP/Composer. The unity of the film is unlike anything before, and the film's questions are so strong that I don't see why people are trying to pin down a statement because it seems to me that the way a film affects someone's thinking is stronger than any statement explicitly stated since the expression comes through the viewer and can be ever more personal because of it. This is my most favorite film of Refn's now, with Bronson coming in second and strangely enough, I didn't like Drive that much even though I thought it was a great movie. People went into this movie expecting Drive 2 and trying to judge it like a regular film. Not possible. This is true embodiment of human thought and emotion, not a movie.",Only God Forgives
378,malickisawesome,A Nightmare Motivated By Childishness,5,10 August 2013,"Cinema has long been compared to a dream. Like a dream, it has the potential to express the inexpressible. Managing to encompass that, Only God Forgives at first seems to be film at its very best; yet one has to only stand back a bit to discover its underlying childishness.Only God Forgives is a warped view of reality almost clinical in its depiction of violent and sexual drives. Utilizing a bold color scheme, an unnerving techno score and deliberately paced editing, director Nicolas Winding Refn, cinematographer Larry Smith, composer Cliff Martinez and editor Matthew Newman create a stylish nightmare of the basest of urges. Displaying simple yet striking compositions, the film's frame seems to come into conflict with itself, underlying the film's main theme of unavoidable conflict through violence. Synths and organs place the viewer in the midsts of hell(Martinez deserves the most credit for the film's eerie atmosphere), while the sharp editing seems to parody the sleek editing of Drive(2011) - more on that in a minute.The acting is probably the most alienating aspect to the viewer, yet if not for the acting the nightmare would be incomplete. The actors, rather than emoting, let their actions and scarce dialogue convey their characters. Ryan Gosling, our moral center for the film, conveys a man of deep repression - always on his guard, ready to burst at any moment. (There are a lot of shots of Gosling's hands clenched up.) We learn that he is this way because of his mother (Kristen Scott Thomas) - there is plenty of Oedipus Rex in this film – though Thomas provides the only ""realistic"" performance, which takes the viewer out of the experience of the film. Oh, I forget to mention the plot is about a drug dealer(Gosling) in Bangkok whose brother is killed and whose mother comes to take revenge on both the killer and the policeman who let the murder occur, which brings me to the following.One of the main points of the film is that the human animal, like all animals, is motivated by two things, and two things alone: sex and violence. Accordingly, true justice will not be achieved because it will consist of one of these two initiatives. Nevertheless, the police man (Vithaya Pansringarm), with his violent outbursts, using a sword that he seems to take out of his back, manages to act as a servant of a kind of justice for the simple reason that he is the only character not motivated by sex. Such an implication suggests that the only attainable justice is bloodshed, which is a rather savage perspective on the world, which fits with the nightmarish tone of the film. Yet one would be wrong in assuming the film takes such savagery seriously, despite the fact that the director does. The film is more concerned with Drive(2011), the director's previous effort, than with everything else. Only God Forgives seems to be a direct response to the overwhelming success of Drive(2011), with Gosling even making a return. The director must have been apprehensive about the critical and audience acclaim because, with this effort, he made a snarky rebuttal. Gosling, who barely spoke in Drive(2011), barely talks in this film; Drive(2011) was stylish and Only God Forgives is even more stylish; and so on. Refn mocks Drive(2011) because of its success, suggesting that any success in the film world is the antithesis of true art and should be rejected by the filmmaker. Well, a lack of success does not make a film art. Despite its technical superiority to most films, Only God Forgives is a product of self indulgence and false morality.",Only God Forgives

382,Michael_Lefman,"If Drive was a dream, Only God Forgives is a nightmare,",8,20 July 2013,"and I mean that in a good way. I mean this movie is relatively horrifying. No longer are the archetypes of even street justice and dignity present here. Here are terrible people facing off against one another with no saving grace beyond the fact that they all suffer. Refn is getting better at painting the psychopath.I saw in an earlier review with the quote ""Refn made the movie he wanted to."" I have to agree with this fully. I think this movie does exactly what it wants to do, and if you're into it, you're into it. Refn has stated in an interview, in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner: ""I am a pornographer."" This is definitely some indulgent violence here. It is, in a strange way, a sort of satire of all the things the contemporary viewer loves to see. Pretty colors, maimed limbs, literal masturbation to Ryan Gosling. I wouldn't call it a deconstruction; I don't think it's that intellectual. I wouldn't put this up there in the hierarchy of great films, either. But it is a new kind greatness addressed to disillusioned, confused youths, mostly probably middle and upper class white males. I kind of wished they had used someone other than Ryan Gosling. I feel like he's too closely associated with Drive's role already. If he was going to fish back into his filmic history a part of me thinks Mads Mikkelsen would've been better for this. But maybe his pretty boy quality was necessary for the role.Anyway I do think it was good. I don't know if it was as good as Drive but I think it's a grower. The critics just seem butthurt, which might've been the reaction Refn was looking for. I expect to see something very different from him next time.",Only God Forgives
383,benjamin-wilson-1983,Art house cinema,7,5 August 2013,"If you're going to this film with the expectation that it is a sequel to Drive then think again. It's easy to understand why you would think that, having seen the trailer in the cinema, it looked to have similar themes and of course the same director has once again put Ryan Gosling in a tight white shirt. That is where the parallels stop, what the viewer gets is 90 minutes of uncomfortable but rewarding viewing.The plot is simple, brother murdered, mother wants revenge and asks remaining son to carry it out. There are obviously sub plots to this and that is in fact what makes the film for me. Vithaya Pansringarm plays the part of the omnipresent, slightly demented, moral crusader to perfection, gliding on and off screen with effortless menace. Kristen Scott Thomas steals every scene she's in as Gosling's far too familiar, foul mouthed and cold mother. As for Gosling, he's hardly the hero in this tale, just another character in the story, he does show glimpses of compassion at times but all in all he overplays the silent, brooding lead role. The scenes of extreme violence will challenge even the most strong stomached amongst the audience, but never the less add to this dark feature. The pace is slow at points but what do you expect from an art house film, it's not Man of Steel you have come to see. I could go on about the lighting and constant use of the colour red but I'll let you discover that for yourself, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys something left of the middle.",Only God Forgives
384,kidsparrow-760-609079,Stylish and seamless/,7,9 August 2013,"Beautifully shot and (in places) exquisitely told. But not much of anything happens. It's gripping, the use of colour is both inventive and cleverly suggestive of what is later to come. Having said that, movies are supposed to be poignant, they are made to make us think, to help us escape all that going on around us and take us away for 2 hours to some other reality in some other space in time. This did neither. Gosling is Gosling, if you've seen him in The Place Beyond the Pines then (minus the tattoo's) you've pretty much seen him in this movie. Kristin Scott Thomas is ridiculously good in this movie. So much so I didn't register it was her until the credits came at the end.I just don't see the point in the film, yes Refn is a 'weirdo' director and has made a name for himself for his immersive, somewhat crooked, films - and i'm not questioning his abilities, he is an auteur of cinema - but this movie is an hour and something of nicely filmed nothing. There wasn't much of a plot, then again, perhaps that was his point. To give it to you in movie speak, it's 'Kill Bill: VOL I' (Tarantino, 2003) meets 'Drive' (Refn, 2011), with a sprinkle of 'BLOW' (Demme, 2001).

385,paulbryan2007,Style/Substance ratio is skewed beyond recognition,2,5 June 2014,"Stylish but astoundingly insubstantial, this film is visually stunning throughout, but was completely doomed by Refn's decision to eliminate all but around nine or ten lines of dialogue to allow more time for lingering shots of Gosling staring blankly into the middle-distance.The torture scenes are more painful for the audience than the recipients of said torture, but they do nothing to elicit an emotional response from the audience - or even build any momentum or tension.By the time the final act of a film arrives, the viewer must have made some kind of emotional investment in AT LEAST ONE of the characters to be interested in how things turn out. However in this case, there wasn't a single character whom I actually cared about, they were all entirely superficial and obnoxious.I know some people feel as strongly positive about Only God Forgives as I do negative - some films are designed to be divisive. For me though, this is way below par by Refn's (normally very high) standards.",Only God Forgives

It is the worst movie I have ever watched.And no, a movie doesn't have to be out of Hollywood or have entertainment every minute for me to like it. I generally enjoy every type of movie, but there was just nothing for me in this film. I'm not saying you won't like it, everyone likes something different. I just don't see how anyone could possibly enjoy sitting there watching this film. I don't mind the low budget lighting and horrible graphics, that I can live with.

This movie, however, is nothing close to the ones mentioned and in fact was more than I could take.This is a dark movie which touches on different obsessions and perversions. The movie fails to develop the characters to the point that I had no feeling for any of them one way or another.The lack of dialog throughout the movie leaves movie goers to guess what the characters are thinking. What few lines are spoken are generally over acted; e.g. ""This bitch says I can't have my room!""

392,michaelphonic-41954,A masterpiece of film,10,4 June 2021,"Only God Forgives is a film by Nicolas Winding Refn, one of my favourite filmmakers. It is an excellent film, exceptionally stylish and powerful, with gorgeous cinematography by Larry Smith and a hauntingly beautiful synth score by Cliff Martinez. I'd like to especially compliment Martinez' score, which perfectly matches the style, tone and cinematography.Set in Thailand, the film begins with an American man who commits a brutally violent murder. This sets in motion a cascading succession of savage violence, with each act being a punishment for the preceding transgression.I'm not someone who enjoys violence in cinema, especially that which is gratuitous, but none of the violence in this movie fits that description. Only God Forgives is a story of revenge and the reason for revenge arises from the brutality of the initial murder. It does not glorify violence but in my opinion mesmerises the viewer through the increasing tension and the ferocity of the violence, although of course many will have to look away from the portrayed brutality: I certainly did at times.Winding Refn does not make films for casual viewers. I have noticed that some of his films do not achieve widespread appeal, perhaps due to his style of filmmaking which does not present the viewer with reams of witty dialogue or non-stop action and quick editing. This may sound pretentious but I feel that for the film connoisseur his films offer breathtaking beauty and power that few directors can match.",Only God Forgives
393,retsnapsaj,Not for everyone.,6,21 July 2013,"This worked for me, but I can understand that many others find it tedious. There is a lot of ambiguity, mostly having to do with the mysterious motivations behind Gosling's character. He has the same elation on his face as in Drive, but more perverted and strange this time. Apart from this there are a few abstract/absurd elements in the story: for instance, certain characters meet each other in paradoxical and inexplicable ways. But to me this was more a matter of deliberate ambiguity and mystery than messiness. The film is also extremely violent. Not constantly, more like a series of intense hits after long silences. This is not primarily used to entertain or bludgeon the viewer, but more to convey the moral conflict going on in Gosling's character. And the final scene may have felt completely weird and ridiculous to many people (I heard much laughter in disbelief), but to me it made perfect sense, albeit in an absurd way, because it seemed to be the only resolution to the conflict going on in his mind. The song at the end just felt like the perfect continuation of the beautiful absurdity just before it.",Only God Forgives

Not to mention Ryan Goslings Extremely limited Dialogue throughout this entire movie & his blank expression through every scene was disappointing to say the least.

395,dme3-624-956960,Depending on what you look for in a film you could either consider to be an artwork or a let down,8,24 May 2013,"I went into the movie theater looking forward to this film. Expecting something along the likes of Drive, which was a great cinematic experience in my opinion, I got to see something which had similarities in execution and style but turned out to be a very different movie from the latter. Without saying too much I will say that this will be one of the weirdest movie experiences you will ever get. It has the same type of artwork that made Drive such a great accomplishment but it takes it a little further. This is done to a point where you can either choose to relate to its ruthlessness and brutality ( it is an extremely violent film) or discard it for it. The setting and scenes are played out beautifully but the pacing feels off as it builds up really slow and never gains pace throughout the showing. At times you feel like you are witnessing scenes from a wonderfully shot masterpiece, yet the next moment it can be as if these scenes add up to nothing substantial. To me it feels as if the director has been overly ambitious and at particular moments he managed to make it work but overall it doesn't hit home. It tries so hard to be memorable and refreshing that at times it turns into a parody of itself. This being said I still enjoyed it for what it was and though the brutality and violence won't be for anyone to be appreciated ( it gets very raunchy)it's an experience I'm glad I did not miss out on. Some other people in the theater where less forgiving ( no pun intended) and left it running for the exit. It's not as accessible as you would want it to be, and it's not as great as it feels it could have been but if you want to watch a film you won't be able to wrap your head around entirely for the next few days I'd say: give it a shot. You might find it worth your while. I certainly found it to be so. A decent piece of artwork or a let down?

The dialogue is laughably bad and shallow at times. It felt like the scriptwriter is a 12 year old who just discovered cuss words and is jamming them into every sentence he could find-- it gets old quick. Its not shocking, its not edgy, its immature. As an Asian, I got really turned off with the policeman.....banishing his sword in slow mo, doing taichi motions.

397,stuartamcintyre,Can be enjoyed if you are not expecting 'Drive 2',9,6 August 2013,"Despite all the bad press on this film, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it!When watching an 'artistic' or 'arthouse' piece of cinema i feel it is up to you as the viewer to look a little deeper and take meaning from what is not said and look into the visuals and symbolic scenes in the film....and not take it at face value which would make it a slow paced film with minimal plot and some ultra violent scenes.To me the film followed the repercussions of one obscene incident, when people do not forgive what others do (or don't do). Within this basic basic story there is a family with a mixed up dynamic where one brother (who has some serious problems, as shown from what happens at the start) is seen as 'perfect' by his mother. The other brother, Julien (Gosling) lives in the shadow of his brother, always being put down by his mother. For me the key scene for showing what is going on is where Julien goes to dinner with his mother and takes Mai with him. His mother shows her total disrespect for him but he shies away then explodes moments after leaving.The film is slow at times and the soundtrack almost hypnotic but this is juxtaposed with the few scenes of graphic violence, mirroring the relationship between Julien and his mother. Julien, quiet and reserved,lives under the thumb of his mother; his mother who violently (verbally and emotionally) lets Julien know that he is second to his brother in every way.I saw the film for the first time last night, so far that is what I make of it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not one to watch over and over, but it is a film worthy of your time in my opinion.If Drive has set your expectations for this film, don't compare them.

399,Weiter-reviews,Art-gore as modern western is a visual intriguing ride.,6,3 September 2013,"Refn's move into the international scene with movies like ""Bronson"", ""Valhalla Rising"" and his 2011 Master piece ""Drive"", has been interesting to follow as this auteur director keeps displaying a masterful skill set when it comes to visual storytelling. Refn doesn't communicate through complex dialogue or extrovert characters, but uses facial expressions, lighting and framing to tell his stories. Only God Forgives moves in the red zone between Drive and Valhalla Rising as it consist of character hybrids of both movies. It is not a movie for everyone, certainly not the ones who prefers a more traditional narrative and dialogue based feature. This is in no way a bad thing, but it signifies the variety of movies and their audiences. Only God Forgives is another dive into the bleak and darkest corners of the human mind, and the display of violence and gore is part of Refn's cinematic language. The movie revolves around three key characters whom fate sends into a violent collision as the brother of the main character Julian (Ryan Gosling) rapes and murders a prostitute. A local police chief named Chang, then performs his own form of higher justices by arranging a mauling punishment for Julian's brother. Afterwards Julian's mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), a twisted abusive and controlling mother with a mother/son perversion arrives and ignites a revenge operation by sending local assassins after Chang. When this fails, Chang returns fire by chopping, cutting and tutoring his way back to Julian's mother, which forces Julian into the crossfire.However, this is only the cliché surface narrative of this modern western feature. It is not the real core of the film, as the underlying story revolves much more about the broken human beings Julian and his brother is, as result from their sexual abusive and perverted mother. The movie is hard to rate, as it provokes the viewer to take a stand point and demands you to either engage in its violent art gore universe or shake your head in disapproval. I found it an interesting piece of art cinema, however it's visual and audiovisual side overshadowed the movie's other mechanics and left it to flickering. The movie is a delight if you are into these art gore films that refn is almost a synonym for, but it doesn't radiate the same involving characters and feel as Drive did.",Only God Forgives

401,Prof-Ratigan,Only God Forgives - Prof. Ratigan,7,20 July 2013,"As someone who thought Drive (2011) should have won the Oscar that year, I was very excited about Only God Forgives (2013). I didn't want to read anything about it or see any clips from it. Even so, I live in the world and some things got through, like the picture of Ryan Gosling's pummeled face that looked more like an allergic reaction to a bee sting than anything else. On IMDb, I saw that it had something to do with a Bangkok cop and a fight. For some reason, I thought Gosling was the cop. He isn't, but that's no nevermind to how the movie would turn out. After Valhalla Rising (2009), I was stunned, lost for words in its vision and visceral qualities. After The Master (2012), I was stunned by the characters and the story, not sure that I understood anything anymore. Only God Forgives has elements of vision, character, and cruelty, but neither stunned nor dazzled me. I'm a little worried that it wasn't even good.Billy (Tom Burke) and Julian (Ryan Gosling) are drug dealers in Bangkok with a sideline in a fight club for adolescents. Bangkok is another world where the line between what is legal and what is illegal is askew. Billy is the older brother and the leader. But when Billy rapes and murders a young girl, Officer Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) allows the father of the murdered girl to beat Billy to death. Chang then punishes the father in his own way. Billy's mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), comes to Bangkok to collect the body of her ""first son"" and see that vengeance is taken. Julian tracks down the aggrieved father, but lets him go when he understands the full story. Crystal, however, is less forgiving, instigating a cycle of violence and pain that will engulf them all.Writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn does effectively create the world of Bangkok. As a setting, it oozes with menace and unpredictability. It's heavy on the red, but a little style is allowed. The problem is that Refn goes well beyond ""a little"" style. Between the many dream or dream-like sequences and un-euphemized Greek characters, it's just too much to carry what is, ultimately, a conventional story. Refn must have spent thirty minutes (and what felt like an hour) filming Gosling walking around his poorly lit hallways with a look of dead pain on his face. In fact, Refn often lingers on people walking from one end of a street or corridor to the other for no other reason than to keep the pace. The big fight scene, what the trailer seems to center around, is utterly inconsequential.I may have to see this again. For one thing,when Billy says ""Time to meet the devil"", I thought he was talking about a sting operation to get to Chang (who had already been vaguely introduced) with the devil in question being a pimp or kingpin. Even when Billy was beaten to death, I thought that he had sacrificed himself to smoke out Chang and his dying was meeting the devil. Neither was the case. So, I was under a significant misapprehension for a key part of the movie. Maybe that would change my view. I also spent a bulk of the movie wanting it to be something else. Obviously, I wanted my police procedural, but when that was obviously not happening, I moved on to wanting Refn to investigate Julien's relationship with Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam). Then I wished we'd seen more of Billy and Julien's relationship either with Billy alive or with Julien interacting with things related to Billy. There is Chang's code, Julien's ambivalence in the world, and Crystal's deep emotional problems.A lot of my aversion of the film stems from the Crystal character, especially her dialogue. She says two very ugly things that I found unnecessary and impolite. First, she says the n-word and I don't like the word and I find it doubly stupid when describing a Thai person. Apparently people say these things still, but nobody I know says them and for that reason it sounds forced and anachronistic. Second, she describes the physical difference between her two sons. I don't think anyone, unless they were totally insane, would admit to the knowledge of her children that she claimed. The emotional abuse about Julien feeling inferior to his brother, I have no trouble with at all. Julien's quiet acceptance of it, I accept. But Crystal is so foul in the mouth, and yet so subdued in her manner that someone has failed somewhere in creating the character. I'm inclined to blame Refn who dresses her terribly and films her indifferently.When I saw the poor rating Only God Forgives, I assumed implicitly that people just didn't feel it. Drive, though it was very well received critically, didn't get its full due when awards season rolled around, so I thought this would be similar. I can see now that I was blinding myself. If people didn't get it or thought it was too violent, they would at least have kept quiet in the face of sound workmanship. The booing and the poor reception, I think, was a combination of what looked like sloppy work and extreme violence. That violence works, I believe, when the film has put me into a trance, but Only God Forgives failed hypnotize. So, when someone gets cut from the abdomen to the collar bone, exposing the ribs like a line of snapped pencils, I was disgusted.It's like Only God Forgives had two different movies going on. The one, the first, was an impressionistic dream state where you aren't sure what's real and what isn't. The other is a basic revenge story with an ambivalent character supposed to enact the vengeance. There, it's clear what's going on and who wants what from whom. The two were not successfully blended.Find other reviews at profratigan.wordpress.com",Only God Forgives

I didn't know a whole lot about the movie, but as a film maker it intrigued me so I went. After 1hr, 45mins passed... I was very pleased with the film, it was fresh and wildly different from any movie I'd seen during that time. I immediately demanded to myself ""Who is responsible for this film? I want more!"" After doing a little research, I discovered the European director Nicholas Wending Refn...About a year later he announced his upcoming film ""Only God Forgives"" and I immediately dove into finding out what this new film was about. It sounded great and after first movie posters featuring pictures of beaten and swollen Ryan Gosling; it looked fantastic...Long story short, it had come out... but only for a short time before it was sent to online/DVD sales. When some friends and I got a hold of it via Apple TV, we got together and rented it.An hour and a half later... We were ticked off at the fact that we had just wasted money to see a boring movie.Look, I loved the cinematography and the whole set-up for the film... But there was simply nothing that drew viewers in. In no way would I say that I am 'just not smart enough' to understand the film, it's just boring, add on the fact that cinematography shouldn't be the soul way to tell a story. I wanted Refn to sketch out his characters for us. We paid $10 to watch a collection of cool shots. The story was cool, I loved the dark grittiness of it all, but I wanted more...

I am sure it is not easy to get funding for a cutting edge film such as this, and you have to applaud the high end actors as well.

Reminds me of Lars Von Trier's work.,10,29 March 2014,"I think what people are missing is the point that whether it be a movie, art or anything else, they are enjoyable dependant on relativity and personal taste. Personally so far I love anything by Nicolas Winding Refn. I watched Valhalla Rising first of all followed by Drive and now Only God Forgives. I love all three of the films so far. They have the same feel to them. In every film I sat glued to my screen, fascinated, captured by the cinematography. Contrary to many peoples opinions I actually the movie thrived on a lack of dialogue, it allowed me to think more, instead of being swept away by a rapidly moving plot line to keep you 100% focused on the film and not stop to think in depth about what you are watching, which I do enjoy, but there are many types of film. I hate to sound cliché but I really do think these movies are suited best for one with a creative mind. To me, the difference between Nicolas Winding Refn or Lars Von Trier movies and most other movies is the difference between a painting and a photo.",Only God Forgives

Or even when he is being tortured, his men don't say ""FU#K it"" and shoot all cops in that room.

Music is perfect. It's amazing how the director creates such a unique and consistent atmosphere. You will love this film if you love cinema. If you're looking for hard-core action, not a good movie for that though it's quite violent in any measure. Acting is great. Gosling does what he does, a fine acting. However, he probably should stop doing this kind of role, kind of repetitive. Kristin is very good. I mean very impressive transformation.

411,holdingstarsup,Uhh.. what did I just watch?,5,26 June 2015,"**I want to preface this saying that there might be a little plot revealing as I'm talking about it, but not much. In all honesty, it was a beautifully shot movie. I would have given it a 6 based on the cinematography. Refn really has been taking strides in the movies he shoots. Ryan Gosling's acting was spot on too... but it was too much like other recent movies (i.e. Drive, Valhalla Rising, etc.). The main character only said a few lines, there was a woman involved pushing the plot forward (in sort of expecting turns) and the main character is trying to redeem themselves in some unrealistic way.Honestly it wasn't the quiet actors or the bloody violence, those features actually enhanced the meaning of the movie more than an average movie goer would think. I think it was how different the movie felt from regular movies. You kind of get the gist of what is going on in the movie, it was dark and full of mystery. Yet I found myself saying, ""what the f***?!"" more than one time. The imagery in the movie really made it worth watching. It was about a God-like figure exacting justice (as he saw fit) ((Vithaya Pansringarm)) and a man trying to avenge his brothers death ((Ryan Gosling)) at his mothers behest. There were a few messed up scenes involving the mother that alluded to the molestation of her children, but as with the rest of the film you don't get a clear picture of what is really going on. A few scenes that I found uncomfortable were the scenes with Chang ((Vithaya Pansringarm)) and his samurai sword, but also the scenes in which he was singing karaoke. It was weird and unnecessarily long. His scenes were gruesome and violent. Other than that it was a quiet violent film that really made you think. If you look down at your phone or decide to talk during a scene with actual dialogue you miss a good chunk of information about the movie. There are few movies that I don't understand the first time that I watch them, and fewer like that, that I decide to never watch again (at least for a long time).",Only God Forgives

This movie hasn't a good content and I think this wasn't the main focus from Mister Winding-Refn, because there is absolutely no flow in the whole film.The fascinating thing in this film was, that each image acquisition could be a wonderfully staged picture - and the latter is quite impressive thanks to a superb camera work by Larry Smith.

It is a beautifully shot, intense movie that doesn't spell everything out for the viewer. You are constantly left wondering after many of the scenes take place or you are left awestruck due to the raw violence. Furthermore, Goslings stoic nature works perfectly for this kind of movie. In my opinion, the director takes all my favorite aspects of Drive (long silences saturated in color, cinematography, etc).

415,tylerlee0622,Only God Forgives: A Philosophical Analysis,9,22 July 2013,"Warning: Contains Spoilers!!!!!!!! Nicholas Scott Refn's recent Lynchian-esque outing ""Only God Forgives"" is polarizing critics on an international scale. Many claim the ninety minute march into a orangish neon hell is a dull, plot-less, tasteless, fetish video to say the least. However, in my insight of the film, I felt Refn has create a modern Shakespearean drama with Dante's Inferno added to good measure and being truly misunderstood for it's over-saturating set pieces.Julian (played by a personal favorite Ryan Gosling) is a drug dealer operating a boxing club front in Thailand, along with his brother they have a disgusting sexual aggression which ranges from obscure voyeurism to the rape and murder of a fourteen year old prostitute. From the beginning Julian realizes his brother crossed an unforgivable line. He has a form of principles and morals, they're blurry and muddy, but he understands his brother did wrong, and his punishment; death, was acceptable.He is then torn between his own primitive vices, his overbearing mother (many suggestions of incest) and the realization of punishment. Every action has a consequence, and he accepts it, however his mother's thirst for revenge (she even rationalizes her son's brutal rape of a child) makes acceptance nearly impossible. His balls are figuratively cut off by his own mother, she belittles Julian, she frequently insults him to to such a horrifying degree (Thomas deserves an award) that it's almost unbearable to watch.Julian's hatred for his own mother is personified from horrible incidents of violence. From smashing a glass over a mans face to dragging a man by his jaw down a hallway, he falls in a sadistic landslide into a personal hell. His fetish of being tied becomes increasingly violent and his relationship with his escort (girlfriend-ish?) becomes much more unstable. This is powerful, being that Gosling's character says about 17 lines of dialogue in the entire film.It all boils down to the fighting match between Julian and the Angel of Death (the detective who killed his brother), whom easily beats Julian despite his old age and stature. Nearly every attack from Julian is blocked or evaded, the Angel of Death is unavoidable and unbeatable, you can never truly escape his grasp. The fight also plays out to such a degree it almost seems that Julian is no longer fighting for his mother and her lust for revenge, but for his own personal plea for forgiveness.The Angel of Death's personal life is introduced midway through the film, it's revealed he has a family. A wife, a child, both of which he cares for, which is strange in a movie that virtually offers no true redeeming characters. The move to seek revenge gets even more personal when Julian and his partner kills his wife and is ordered to kill the child as well. Julian is now in the same position as his brother was the night he murdered a child. This position of power becomes almost godlike, he is the judge of who lives and who dies. Badly beaten and knowing his entire life is crumbling beneath him, he realizes the only true path to forgiveness is to forgive. He spares the child and murders his cohort, cutting that part of his life entirely.The sparing of the child moves Julian to true redemption. He begins to see the error in his ways, and realizes judgment is inevitable. After finding his mother's corpse (whom the Angel of Death hunted down), he makes the last insult to her demeaning existence, he cuts into her body and shoves his hand in her. Many can deem this as him longing to return to the womb, however I feel it's his sign of aborting himself from her, freeing himself from her grasp. She mentioned considering an abortion earlier in the film, it's realized in the end by Julian technically ""giving an abortion"" to her. He is removing himself from her, clearing his mind from torment.As the film crawls to a close, Julian is lounging in the strip club where his escort-friend works. He's gazing into her more as a person rather than an item he can use. He finally finds a sense of true respect, no longer the false acceptance of his mother. The Angel of Death sits across from him, he knows his crimes. His cohort murdered his wife in front of his child, he killed a fellow police officer, all of these crimes have been conducted by Julian. However, he spared his child from death, he found acceptance. The Angel of Death then fades into a set of surreal shots.The surreal shots end and it shows Julian on his knees in a forest. Above him stands The Angel of Death wielding his sword. Julian extends his hands accepting fate. Hands and arms are depicted often in the film, it represents the violence that stains Julian's mind. His tools of aggression are forfeited, he openly accepts responsibility for everything. The sword swings down implying Julian's arms were cut off. However, I feel it was a metaphysical depiction of judgment passing. God has forgiven and Julian surrenders his anger and rage with his dead mother. It's an awe inspiring moment and somewhat of a happy ending.Only God Forgives is truly being misjudged for another Euro-trash piece of ""film-making"", however I feel like it might be one of the best films in recent memory. Not only is it beautifully shot, but it's much more deeper than most think. Call me a moron, this is my argument.",Only God Forgives

Personally I've seen thousands of films (arthouse, vintage, silent, classics, independent, mainstream from every era and of every genre) and like to think I can tell the difference between what can be regarded as good and what is bad....this film is the latter. Other reviewers have praised it's cinematography, style, art direction, production design, soundtrack and atmosphere, which are all well and good but this film lacks, story, characters and emotional substance, which in my opinion are a basic requirement. As each character is introduced, not once do any of them bring any kind of characterisation to the story that is worth watching - they are all devoid of anything engaging or any original motivation. Ryan Gosling may as well be any other character he has played lately, Kristin Scott Thomas was just a pantomime evil witch and Vithaya Pansringarm's character had no substance to warrant his actions, everyone else was just your standard henchman or moll. If the film had delivered something memorable and original then it could be heralded as a cult classic but unfortunately this film was empty and forgettable.

Anyway, I also didn't get why people thought it was too slow? I've seen other movies that are boring but I still watch them to the end unlike people now a days who can't sit still for more than 10minutes. I thought Kristin Scott Thomas as the mom was great.

The ending of this movie comes abruptly and doesn't seem in keeping with the story so far! Having Hollywood stars made no difference to this movie, partly due to the lack of lines, and partly due to the fact that the only focal point of this movie is the horrific violence in some of the scenes.

There is so much to be seen in this piece of art, but the problem with it is that nearly everyone was expecting it to be Drive's sequel. If anything, this is Refn (who is a GENIUS) telling the world he isn't a one-string banjo.First off, the scenery is beyond gorgeous and apparently filmed in real places, all magnified by Refn's art-house finesse. The story, while simple, is only there to bind these people together. It is not about a drug dealer in Thailand, it is about Julian being surrounded by evil people and feeling tremendous guilt about actions he took at the command of his domineering, psychotic (and possibly sexually abusive) mother. It is about him constantly seeing blood on his hands and the repercussions of his obviously destructive past. He turns on these bad people and receives forgiveness from God.There is so much in this film that I could fund a ""Room 237"" film about it.

This one is a case in point. But then, I go to movie forums like this one and see it gets about half the stars it deserves.Everything about ""Only God Forgives"" is high octane. Yes it got a couple of big name actors, but that's not all it had. The story, simple as it is, was one of those things so icy in it's forthrightness and unforgiving (no pun intended) moral resolution that it bothers people who expect some rosy twist that sends the cast into the sunset at the end. This is not a film for the fans of glitter farting unicorns, which makes me no longer wonder why it seems to have bombed with American audiences.The style was hi def hypnosis. It was like everyone was moving through water or something. The police captain was a frigging machine, every move his body made calculated, deliberate and slow as the general action of the film. Punctuated by moments of lightning savagery, just to make you appreciate it's rare appearances.Oh, and the music. This was just world class stuff. I don't know why IMDb makes you search for the composer's credits when this is such a vital part of any film. It should have gotten a boatload of awards on the music alone.This is not your Disney lovers' film. It is red hot visually and aurally, simply brutal and just.

430,williejk,"A Beautiful, Brutal, Bizarre Picture",7,16 July 2016,"Only God Forgives is an unusual film to review. On the one hand, I feel obligated to recommend it for its beautiful cinematography and Refn's undeniable mastery of his craft. Yet, I am simultaneously repulsed by many of the scenes framed and presented, however well shot they may be. Indeed, Refn has reverted back to his more independent style of film making, his pre-Drive era if you will, and as such if you expect Only God Forgives to be as accessible as his 2011 effort, you will probably find yourself disappointed. This is an extremely brutal look into the psyche of a criminal as he grows ashamed of the actions and choices he has made, and as such wishes to repent for his questionable life.Ryan Gosling plays the criminal in question; a drug smuggler named Julian who is but a pawn in his sadistic Mother's operation, played by Kristin Scott Thomas. After the murder of Julian's older brother at the hands of the police officer Chang, portrayed by Vithaya Pansringarm, his mother tasks him with bringing Chang to 'justice'. Most of the narrative that follows is told in typical Refn style, with sparse and infrequent dialogue, and mostly through the use of visual story telling. The cinematography is exquisite and must be praised, using brilliant use of lighting and shadow to convey emotion and mood. The acting, for the most part, is also good. Vithaya Pansringarm is very apt at portraying the steely-cold Chang who dispatches sinners with uncompromising efficiency, and Scott Thomas really did convince as the truly psychopathic, almost incestuous matriarch of the criminal family. However Gosling, unusually, didn't quite make the cut. He is once again stoic and unflinching as he was in Drive, but in parts in Only God Forgives it seems that he is almost sleep-walking his way through. The narrative is in part told through dream sequences so perhaps this was the desired effect, but he nevertheless appears gormless.Indeed, where the film does falter is in its more existential moments. Sometimes they do work, such as with Chang's seemingly angelic nature, as he makes swords appear out of nowhere as he dispatches justice (indeed, he is the metaphor for God to which the title refers), but in other scenes it falls flat. The most peculiar of which is the recurring karaoke scenes where Chang sings in front of the characters of film as they watch from tables in an exotic nightclub. The film is also horrifically brutal in places. Refn's films are notorious for their unflinching violence, and I must say, he can go overboard. Such is the case in one particular scene as Chang tortures a criminal in order to get information. The scene is far too long, and just when you think it cannot get more sickening, it does. The shot length is extremely long as we are witness to close ups of eye-slitting and chest stabbing. It is far too brutal, and it does spoil the film.However, Only God Forgives is still a good film and I do recommend it. While the existential scenes can be a little too random, and while some of the violence is too graphic, it is nevertheless visually stunning, with a brilliantly atmospheric soundtrack to complement it. I must also praise a director who is willing to push the boundaries and continue to make independent films that challenge audiences. Some hate his work, others may love it, but in the end, for a man to make art so divisive is extraordinary to behold. Only God Forgives is not a bad as some may say, but it nevertheless isn't Refn's greatest film.",Only God Forgives
431,darkvalnar,Cinematographic masterpiece starring Ryan Gosling,8,29 May 2016,"Just got done watching Only God Forgives.And if you liked Drive, watch this one! Review here:All jokes aside, this movie is not for everyone. Not only because of the gore it offers, no. The whole directing style, it's clearly aimed to deliver something artsy, something out of place, something that makes you lean back at the end and say ""wow"". There is little to no action in this movie, there is no comic relief, there are a little thriller elements. Ryan Gosling's performance is incredible, he has about 30 lines and that's it. His counterpart is a cop who brings justice to thugs and gangsters by sword and is being played by Vithaya Pansringarm. Ryan Gosling's character descents into madness as the movie progresses, but it doesn't show it obviously. It gives you low key hints here and there. Soundtrack by Cliff Martinez (Drive) and directed and written by Nicolas Winding Refn.SPOILER SECTION Don't READ FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO WATCH ITJulian's (Ryan Gosling) whole family seems to be f'ed up. His brother rapes and murders underage girls, his mother calls assassinations on people and Julian himself killed his own father, probably on behalf of his mom. Now the thing is, the movie pictures Ryan Gosling's dark and violent fantasies when in one scene, pictured by wearing a black shirt, beats random people up in his club and then dragging them out while grabbing their teeth. The cop who serves justice by sword, Chang, has such a BIG role too. Every time he's served his justice by sword, he returns to a Karaoke bar with the rest of his police squad and sings a Thai song, while all the other officers look at him and show a feeling of awe and guilt at the same time. In one scene you can get a glimpse at one of the officers having wet, red eyes, implying that he was crying. As for the comparison with Drive, Ryan Gosling's character dies in this movie and doesn't play the hero. But it basically has the same soundtrack director and the same Director. So if you liked Drive, watch this one! I rate this movie 8/10",Only God Forgives
432,DanielFilipeR,Why Only God Forgives is a great movie?,10,24 February 2017,"At first I was not going to write nothing on this movie, but apparently a tons of people (even film critics!) are misleading this movie, therefore I feel the need to actually explain a bit of this movie. First of all, I want to make it clear that this isn't the best movie ever nor even a masterpiece. But I think it's pretty much worth studying it and learn the point that Nic Refn is trying to make here. Also I won't be talking deeply on every subject, I'm only going to explain some of the meanings because, believe it or not, this movie has a lot of meanings.Only God Forgives tells a story about redemption of a boy called Julian. How's that? Well, we basically watch Julian staring at his hands a lot, and hands, in this movie, is an connotation for guilt. As the movie goes, we have a pretty good looking shot of Julian in the bathroom washing his hands and suddenly blood appears, emphasizing the meaning of hands being guilt. Julian feels like he has blood on his hands, and by almost of the end of the movie we learn why: we learn that Julian actually killed his father and wants to get rid of this guilt, therefore he has visions of someone cutting out his arms. More on that later... Julian also is traumatized not just by his father's killing but also because of his relationship with his mother, implying that there was an physical affection between them, and that prevents him from having a normal relationship, in this case with Mai.Also we have a cop called Chang, and in this movie, to make it clear, he is God. Nicolas Refn is the one to admit it on an interview. With that in mind it clarifies more of the movie to us. Since the beginning we have characters looking to Chang as if they actually have knowledge of him being God. In one of the firsts scenes we see Julian's brother looking to Chang as if he is not just someone but something more special. This also explains why through the movie he is able to draw a sword out of nowhere and why he is untouchable and why he exacts vengeful justice and forgiveness on sinners.Without wasting more time I'm going to be quick on this and conclude this mini explanation. Knowing what we know now, the film ends by Julian finding peace, away from his past. He knows he has sinned and he gives Chang his arms to get cut-ted off, finally getting rid of his past and move on and finally have a normal relationship.Unfortunately the movie doesn't show us a bit of Julian getting back to Mai already cured. And also I get that Refn also emphasizes his fetish for gore and blood. But overall, in spite of leaving a lot out to explain, this is the basic arc of our main character, and the way of Refn tell this story is unique and gorgeous (with his wonderful cinematography). Now that you understand more the film it is up to you to decide whether to like this film or not. Again, it is not perfect but is an fantastic movie that a lot of people don't understand, giving space to hate. It's one of my favorite Refn movies and I adore it. Speacially for film students, I highly recommend checking out.That's all I have to say in a quick way and I'm sorry for my bad English, I'm not English. Hope I've clarified something.",Only God Forgives
433,shawnbauer,How to be pretentious for dummies,3,13 February 2020,"Drive was a good movie and I was hoping Refn could do it again but this was really bad and really disappointing.I've burnt myself out with how much I don't like this movie from the pretentious jump cuts between characters doing literally nothing acting as if that were deep, or the blatant symbolism that hits you as hard as a aluminum slugger to the dome (haha see it keeps cutting back and forth between a golden idol and the guy because hes supposed to be God geeee I'm so smart).There's nothing smart about this movie there's nothing deep about this movie. The only props I can give are the shots are pretty nice and they create a very dream like atmosphere although it feels like a fever dream with the nonsensical ""plot."" There's one scene with an exposed ribcage so good job with the effects on that one even though the death was meaningless and felt like it was only there to be there.I could write about how the the character who represents God is ridiculously annoying and cannot be taken seriously. I could also write how every character is similar in that they are void and awful but I'd be much more content letting this fade from my memory.3/10 watch if you like to pretend you're smart",Only God Forgives

435,AlexWinterr,People will find meaning anything,3,16 May 2020,"I typically like Refn, but this was just disappointing. The plot line is fundamentally a banal revenge tale, cinematography as always is amazing but thats just not enough to save this.
To respond to the positive reviews i'm seeing: How?
Symbology? Where? Nothing happens in this. You get presented with basic characters that have a potentially interesting dynamic, which is explored with... long surreal scenes in which the characters just stare at each other? Its sad how people won't call out a movie just because they believe that lauding a film that the ""simple plebs"" have rated negatively will make them seem like a connoisseur or ahead of the flock.
To end this: it feels like Refn tried to avoid making a mindless flick by leaving blanks for the viewer to fill in. Problem is, when 90% of the movie is a blank for the audience to fill in, the result it something that just feels plain lazy more than anything else.",Only God Forgives

The fact that the plot is basic and iffy, extremely predictable, and to top it off there are no characters in this movie, I mean, there are, strictly speaking, but the most interesting ones are usually tertiary to the main cast.The main characters are just not there, they dont act in a way that's interesting, or logic, or human, there's no development, no world-building, the director mostly expects you to figure it out, which is not bad in itself, but I just found it SO boring due to the fact that I did not care about any of the characters, at all, thats the main problem when a creator goes for the ""I'm not going to explain it, I'm not going to make it predictable, I'm just going to do me, if you get it, that's awesome, if you dont, thats on you"". Problem is that a huge part of storytelling is getting your audience interested in the characters central to the story, but that never happens here and it was not even a mistake, it's by design.He tries to play around with this idea that the Inspector is some kind of personification of a primal force or some such, but really it does not ever develop into something meaningful and it ends up in the ""this was my edgy project for film school finals"" territory.Overall, I feel like I wasted my time watching this movie.",Only God Forgives
443,sirgeddon,"Don't expect another ""Drive""",7,21 July 2013,"If you go into this movie expecting something similar to Drive, you will be disappointed. This movie is more similar in tone to one of Refn's previous efforts ""Valhalla Rising"". The meditative, slow mood with brilliant lighting and lots of beautiful static shots, lots of silence accompanied with short bursts of visceral violence, scenes which play out like dreams or nightmares would remind one of that movie.I guess the filmmaker's attempt was to make a movie which relied a lot on mood, atmosphere and images to tell a story than the conventional dialogue or plot. I also felt because of the way the story is told, the audience is left to interpret what some of the scenes meant or who the characters really are or what the themes are.Strong points in this movie are the gorgeous cinematography and the soundtrack. Performances are good. Ryan Gosling plays a much different character from the one in Drive. Vithaya Pansringarm does a decent job. However, the best performance comes from Kristin Scott Thomas who does a wonderful job of portraying her character's complex nature without relying a lot on dialogue or exposition. If you enjoy watching art house films and in a mood to experience something that's different from the usual mainstream movie and not squeamish about watching violence, then give it a try.",Only God Forgives

In hindsight I would have preferred the paint. The stoic demeanor of the characters is ridiculously overdone to the point of being annoying.

But while the violence in ""Drive"" came with a reason, connected to the simple but coherent story, the brutality here ends in itself. The rest of the plot is as simple as boring and predictable. So time goes by very slowly watching this movie. A positive aspect would be the acting of the support acts. Only Ryan Gosling and the Thai-cop Vithaya Pansringarm carry the same mimic ALL THE TIME!

The fantastic Cinematography is just fantastic, it's defiantly one of the most beautiful made movie I have seen. The fantastic colors, the filming angel, yeah everything was just bravo! The acting was good, even though Ryan Gosling had 16 lines or something like that. Kristin Scott Thomas was amazing and funny! The negative part of the move was the plot. It's very TIHN! If you read the plot here on the IMDb, it's basically that. The other thing was that the scenes were extremely slow, but the awesome music soundtrack made it more enjoyable. I personally like violence movie, and only god forgives has a lot of violence in it. The violence of the movie makes the drill are there and the climax is high. Overall Drive was better, but with a small tip toe.

450,melisakurtay,Pretentious,1,8 July 2013,"I went to the film mainly for Kristin Scott Thomas, as in the trailer I got excited by seeing her transforming into a villain.She was still great in OGF. She might be the only good thing.My first opinion about the film is that, it is so obsessed about aesthetic that they didn't care there was no meaningful script. Pretentious written all over it.It is as if Ryan Gosling just came from his home with the same outfits, same hairstyle he has in his everyday life and giving the same looks over and over again in nearly most of his films. Its like a staring contest with Ryan Gosling. He is not mysterious. He is not meaningful. Its not that he expresses so many emotions with his eyes. And what can he express with such a rootless character.No dialogue written. Thats OK. Thats a choice. Not every film needs to be filled with non-stop smart lines. But what counts is what is written as dialogue. Here it fails big time. I read in some reviews that they say film is slow. I'm OK with a film being slow but if a man walks half his speed just to look cool or moves half his speed just to look mysterious it looks silly and boring. Police singing, doing karaoke in the bar, the prostitute just being there looking pretty and in pain, all the wallpapers etc. they all irritated me as its so ""look at me i'm so cool and enigmatic wow"". Its hard to pull that off. Takashi Miike, David Lynch they can pull that off.As a fan of Asian films, this seemed a like a 4 year old little boy who wants to be like his 25 year old cool uncle. A long way to go. Its just sad that so many films that are actually similar to this ""wannabe film""'s story exist. But they don't have big names like Ryan Gosling in it. So no one is even aware of those.Being a good director should mean combining aesthetics and good story.

Because of the focus on scenery and the lingering shots the pace is dreadfully slow. There are shots where there is no movement at all I was sometimes wondering if I was looking at a picture or a film. The characters show little to no emotion and I couldn't identify myself with one single character. Sometimes it looks like all they do is stare.

Only morbid curiosity and the fact I couldn't wake my friend up prevented me from leaving half way through. Complete and utter disappointment from start to finish. Unconvincing actors, unconvincing story and just downright awful. This film is an absolute fall from grace for the director and for Gosling after the masterpiece that was Drive.

It's nowhere near as good as ""Drive"" but still.Let me say this: Ryan Gosling's quiet, brooding shtick is played out. The performances here are either laughably low-key or wildly over-the-top (well, just Scott-Thomas) and the plot pretty much would fill a 20-minute short film nicely. But this is a 90-minute film so we get a LOT of slow pans over characters reflecting and crap. I mean some of the scenes in this film verged on parody.What I won't say about this film is that it's boring. What I will say about it that it's GORGEOUS. There are some absolutely beautiful shots in this that made me want to punch a wall because they were so cool. It's also funny that he thanks Jodorowsky and Gaspar Noe because the influence is clearly evident.In summary, i'll say this film is destined to be a cult classic. I get all the hate but it's not the Worst Movie Ever but it's not great or technically good either.

458,crustywaffle,Something unexpected.,8,26 July 2013,"To watch Only God Forgives is an experience that a person must be able to fully dedicate them selves to. It is not a movie that can be watched or listened to in the background, and in order for it to succeed in the story that it's attempting to tell your full undivided attention must be given to it. When first getting into the movie and reading about its premise you may come to expect that it will be an action title; a movie that shows the gritty side of Thailand and all the seedy places we have come to expect.While the movie takes place in Thailand and you will find it's setting all through out the movie, it only serves as a backdrop. Instead the movie decides to drop you into the middle of peoples lives, not bothering to go through bouts of explanation in back story and how the characters got to where they are today. This is coupled with imagery which is more heavily focused upon than dialog. The film asks you to see the scenes and watch the characters face, to read their emotions and create your own thoughts.The film focuses primarily on two characters; Ryan Gosslings character Julian, whose brother is killed in the beginning of the film, and who has been tasked with tracking down and finding the main responsible for his brothers death. The other character is that of ""Chang"" a figure who could be called a ""God of Justice"", a police officer who is responsible for the death of Julians brother. Through out the film we witness these two characters, and how they are dealt with very similar situations, but ultimately find different paths to a conclusion.Again, you cannot expect to go into this movie expecting heavy action sequences and guns blazing. Instead the movie takes its time, and instead attempts to explain the nature of sin. Using imagery of characters and hallucinogenic trips, lighting which conveys different levels of emotion, and a subtle soundtrack. All of this is overlapped by scenes of intense violence.Over all the movie is enjoyable and should be watched by any one who has some time to actually watch a movie. I don't promise you'll understand it all, because it's not really a movie to be understood. Instead you need to look at it like a painting, and simply appreciate what is being presented to you.",Only God Forgives
459,creatureishness,A Great Film That Could Have Been Better,8,7 August 2013,"This film is not for everyone. It is dark, violent, slow and abstract. This movie is abstract art at its finest, and it was always bound to alienate the audience.So, let's start out with the positive elements. First off, the cinematography is excellent. Maybe just a little too perfect even, since every single shot looks like a production still. This can take you out of the film every now and again, but mostly it works fine. The inspired score by Cliff Martinez should also be noted, primarily for the fight scene of course, but also in general, as his synth-tones help the moody atmosphere. All of Refn's films are about atmosphere. Valhalla Rising was bleak and surreal, Drive was vibrant and warm, and here Refn creates a moody, nightmare landscape that the characters float through. The streets almost have a ghoulish life of their own (akin to the bridge scene in Apocalypse Now) Neon lighting reflects off puddles of blood and water alike, and faces drift in and out of the shadows. As an atmospheric work, OGF is superb.On the down side, this movie was never intended for a mainstream audience. The slow pacing, the taciturn characters, the ultra-violence are all classic Refn trademarks. This film is closer to Valhalla Rising than Drive, and intentionally so. Ryan Gosling plays a quiet, brooding character again, but despite poor reviews of his performance, he actually manages to imbed Julian with a distinct personality. He has an obvious fear of Chang (shown by his eyes rather than words) but he is also obviously a tortured soul, filled with self-loathing and regret, but incapable of actually taking action. It seems like his character was a wasted opportunity, as more characterization and dialogue (especially with his brother) would help explain his character more than staring into the distance, and he might have provided a more dynamic protagonist. Kristin Scott Thomas provides a bit of camp as his evil mother, and she helps lighten the tone a bit with her verbal barbs. Vithaya Pansingram provides the most wooden role as the omniscient Chang, but that feels correct considering his role in the movie.There are a few other questionable decisions made by Refn. The brutal torture sequence drags on a bit, the karaoke sequences were overdone (except the last one) and the ending could have been better handled (see the original scrip). Still, all of these were obviously intention choices, probably designed to make the Drive fanboys run for the doors.As a final thought, perhaps the reason why this film has so divided critics is its lack of importance outside of the script. Valhalla Rising was an exercise in symbolism from Norse mythology; OGF is an exercise in symbolism from Refn's mind. Their is no other context here, so the power of the symbols feels reduced. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does explain why so many feel it necessary to call it pretentious garbage.On the whole, OGF is a masterwork from the mind of an artist. It's not designed to sell big or to win awards. It's a labor of love. By all means see it, but don't expect another Drive.",Only God Forgives
460,robert-i-starks,Pretty disgusting and not very fun,5,25 July 2013,"I think I really set myself up to be disappointed with ""Only God Forgives"". I was so impressed with the tone of ""Drive""; Its shocking juxtaposition of tenderness and brutality, its awesome sense of neo-80s style, and its incredible mise en scene. The shots were well composed, there was effective use of slow motion, (the opposite of Zach Snyder) and the music kicked ass! It is just an incredibly cool and stylish film. ""Only God Forgives"" is a study in ominous, Kubrick-like horror and tension, and savage, brutal ugliness. I can see how this film was probably exciting for both Gosling and Refn. In ""Drive"" Gosling plays essentially a super hero. The Driver is inexplicably capable and quick to act in violent situations and is pretty much impervious. In ""Only God Forgives"" he plays a man who is crippled by his relationship with his mother and passively stares at the world through inexpressive eyes. He doesn't act on his surroundings very often, and when he does it does't work out well. I imagine it was exciting for Gosling to play such a different character than normal. And Refn got to explore all the depraved violence he seems to get a kick out of. I will admit it is on me that I set my hopes so high for the film. From the trailers and from reading about the film online I knew it wasn't exactly going to be a picnic. It got boos from some of the audience at Cannes for being so violent, and it was easy to see the tone would be a lot darker than that of ""Drive"". I just was hoping for something I could enjoy a little more. The film begins with a horrible act of depravity and continues with more and more disgusting violence, the apex of which is a scene that you can really only call torture porn. I don't mind violence in film a lot of the time if I feel like it is justified by the story. For me the story of ""Only God Forgives"" is not worth depicting that level of violence. With all that said, I do admire a lot of the technical aspects of the film. The music by Cliff Martinez is darkly atmospheric, the lighting is cool, the shots are well composed, and the tension is palpable. There are surreal scenes that have a suspenseful, horrific effect like in Kubrick's ""The Shining"". The fight scene is superb, and the music during the scene is my favorite in the film. Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent at portraying disgusting, horrible mother. I've read a lot of people complain about everyone else in the film as not having any personality, but I thought the level of restraint in all the performances was admirable, not something to criticize. The actor who played the Thai cop was especially good at conveying a lot of power without doing much. There were some interesting themes explored in the film. One I already alluded to is the theme of passivity vs. the power and will to act resolutely. Online, Refn explains the film is about a Thai cop who thinks he's God and an American gangster who's looking for a religion. Gosling seems to be in awe of the God-like power the cop possesses, and since his mother is so awful he could use somebody to respect as a parental figure. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! With a desire to understand that power, and perhaps gain some respect himself, he challenges the cop to a boxing match and gets absolutely destroyed. He doesn't even come close to landing a blow and doesn't seem to come close to whatever it is he's searching for. There is also a very strong oedipal theme in the film that I think is more complex than meets the eye. In the film we find out that at his mother's behest Gosling's character killed his father. This would definitely support the standard oedipal complex. But there's a line Kristin Scott Thomas has about how when she was pregnant with him she felt like he wanted to be aborted. In one of the surreal scenes Gosling is at a strip club and puts his hand in the ""womb"" of a stripper. He doesn't appear to be getting sexual pleasure from it though. He just seems peaceful. Later, when he finds his mother dead, he takes a sword, cuts open her belly and sticks his hand in her ""womb"". It's as if the womb is the only place he ever felt safe and he had never wanted to come out alive in the first place, which is more existential than oedipal. This idea seems clear at the end of the film as well, when he holds out his arms and lowers his head in submission to the sword wielding cop. The next and final scene is the cop singing a sweet lullaby of a song in karaoke. To me this suggests that Gosling's character finally finds peace in death and that the cop is singing him to a sleep of the eternal kind. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!END SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!For me ""Only God Forgives"" is just too disgusting and ugly. I didn't exactly expect ""Drive 2"" but I did hope it would be more enjoyable and accessible than it was. Perhaps I am getting soft. A while back I liked a film called ""The Proposition"" that was similarly brutal and not very fun but had excellent acting and production values, as well as an ominous score by Nick Cave. Maybe I'm just getting old. I got tired of the violence and grossness of ""Game of Thrones"" and no longer watch that show despite its excellent production values and intriguing characters. I feel like the trend toward more and more visceral, disgusting films, isn't one I am interested in pursuing. I guess I'm glad I saw ""Only God Forgives"" once, but don't think I will watch it again. At least not in its entirety.",Only God Forgives

The movie is well shot, very nice colors and the cool thing is, it lets you fill in some things for yourself. The bad guy is BAD. And Kristin Scott Thomas is marvelous! But after Drive, Ryan is stuck! He needs to do things differently the next time around! I believe it has one of the hardcore scene in a movie since a while. I could really feel the pain at some point. The music is very well put to every scene. But because of the environment also the only logic choice.

I thought based on previews this would be a great piece to watch and I am a Big fan of Gosling. The trailer felt edgy and almost Mysterious. I was hoping for a Gosling from ""Drive"" but more gritty and in an Art form. with long winded stares scenes and a lack of dialogue makes this hard to enjoy. The jumping to different scenes gets annoying makes you feel as if Lynch had a hand in the making but it falls short to that as well.I felt disappointed by the end that I did not turn it off halfway, I only paused it get to get a drink.",Only God Forgives

If you like listening to a sixty year old Thai policeman sing karaoke for an hour you will like this movie. The story was so incoherent if you watched this while tripping on LSD you might actually be able to make sense out of it. In truth some things just shouldn't be made into movies. Not everything is cinematic material. I appreciate the attempt by the director to produce something that is artistic. The camera shots and scenery are visually gripping. However you have to have a story. Give just a little background on your characters. Have some dialogue for God's sake! I just can't imagine who would pay to have something like this produced.

464,ethandco,Only God Forgives,8,8 September 2013,"A visual masterpiece. Amazing soundtrack. Very awkward dialog and the acting was iffy. I understand Refn's ""style"", but I must say this film most certainly does not live up to some of his other films. I did enjoy this film very much regardless of its flaws, I enjoyed its unique style and its visual art.The movie, I'm sure, had deeper meaning but I couldn't really pinpoint what the objective was in this film. It most certainly kept me entertained, the mysterious personality of all of the characters enticed me. The police officer (Vithaya Pansringarm) was the most interesting and mysterious character of them all, I saw him as a form of ""Karma"" to all of these people who had done wrong. But that's just my view.In conclusion, if I happened to come across this movie at the store or while watching T.V. I would definitely pick it up and watch it. Even with its confusing message, whatever it may be, it is still a great film for those who enjoy indie films and aren't looking for some huge CGI scenes and A-List actors.",Only God Forgives

But this movie is just so incredibly dull and boring you don't care about anything that is happening on the screen, you don't care about any of the characters, you don't care about any of the subtext because it's all just so damn DULL and emotionless.Films like mulholland drive and the fountain are examples of artistic films done well, because even if you don't follow these mind bending stories, they still provide the audience with an incredibly deep and powerful experience. After the fountain I felt at peace and on the verge of tears. After mulholland drive my mouth hung open for ten minutes stunned by what I had just experienced and the complexity of it.

Bad acting (and there are good actors in it, I'm sorry to say) poor lighting, questionable and laboring, extremely slow moving plot , gratuitous violence (and lots of it), filthy language (ok, I should be used to that; it seems to be a requirement these days) .. the list goes on. Now I'm 30 minutes into it and it hasn't improved - I'm not even sure what the points are they are trying to make. Ryan Gosling has one facial expression throughout and Kristin Scott Thomas isn't much better. This is supposed to be ""art"" - what were they thinking?",Only God Forgives
467,miketrance-dk,"Great imagery can not carry a bad script, but it sure can hide it.",8,24 May 2013,"With Drive (2011), danish director Nicolas Winding Refn found a much larger audience than was the case with his earlier movies. A lot of those who embraced Drive will definitely be disappointed with Only God Forgives. While Drive was focusing on the plot and development between the characters, this is certainly not the case here. From the beginning of Only God Forgives, it is clear that the movie is going to indulge in the realm of art house cinema in much the same way as Winding Refn did in Valhalla Rising (2009). The movie is dedicated to chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo, Santa Sangre, Holy Mountain) and it is easy to see why. It is packed with dreamlike sequences and symbolic (?) imagery in a manner similar to the movies of Jodorowsky. In an aesthetic manner, these images works terrific, every frame composed with great virtuosity with regard to light and colors. This is also the case with the violent scenes, which some people will refer to as quite extreme. Because of this, I certainly was absorbed in the movie.However, the movie definitely has its problems, which will cause many people to reject it. It is easy to think of all this great cinematography as simply being a cover-up for a story that is extremely thin. The point of departure is pretty weak, and we never get to learn the protagonist Julian (Ryan Gosling), only his dreams and fantasies, meaning that we don't even now whether they belong to him at all. While many people will find those flaws to be crucial, I can - without claiming to be god - forgive Winding Refn, solely based on the effect of imagery itself, not because of its contribution to the story, which is not a contribution at all. Kristin Scott Thomas delivers some great acting as Julians vicious mother, while Ryan Gosling is not really getting much to work with. If you are willing to let yourself getting carried away by the images and do not emphasize the lack of coherence and plot structure, you might find that Only God Forgives delivers. Expect a movie like Drive, and the chances of disappointment are high.",Only God Forgives

Don't listen to people that make their careers criticizing the work others have done without contributing anything of value themselves. I never submit reviews here, but this deserves it.I didn't think Only God Forgives was absolutely perfect, but I'm giving it a 10 to offset the bad scores - it deserves much more than that, and I expected to see something between a 7 and an 8. Due to the critical bandwagon, I almost didn't give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. I'm not going to break down or write a synopsis of the film for you, but if you can get on board with little dialog & slow pace, beautiful cinematography, extreme violence, deep symbolism/metaphor, and an alternative method of visual storytelling, it's for you.

The acting is excellent, with an amazing performance of Ryan and Kristin Scott Thomas. The cinematography of Nicholas is as always perfect, the use of color (mostly red, blue and whiten) is excellent. I don't think you can compare it to drive, it's slower, more violent and intenser. The soundtrack ( I think by Kavinsky) is amazing, it fits really good with the scenes and the atmosphere Nicolas is trying to create. Overall i would go see this movie, if you can take some violence, there are some really bloody and gory scenes, if you liked drive, there is a big chance you are going to like Only god forgives.",Only God Forgives
470,whoiscoopsey,A future cult classic misunderstood,10,26 July 2013,"This is my favourite film of 2013 so far, so much depth and meaning. If you are expecting another Drive film you should look at the rest of Refn's filmography. All the cast are stellar with Gosling playing an even more creepier and twisted version of his character from Drive, KST was very good as usual but the one that stands out amongst the rest is Vithaya Pansringarm with the best scenes being the karaoke songs and (what I think is the best scene in the entire film) the fight between Julian and Chang. The music that Cliff Martinez creates is euphoric and I surprisingly like the Thai songs used throughout the film. The biggest shame of the film is that the cinematography of Larry Smith will be cruelly overlooked when awards season comes by as it is just mesmerizing with the use of colours and the various locations of Bangkok. I can see this film being a cult classic in the future and I would also give it a few watches in order to understand what Refn is trying to do or say. Some may think it is pretentious but I feel like there are few films that try to put across the notions that Refn does, and for that Refn has now become one of my favourite directors.",Only God Forgives

Acting is fine, story is average, but it really just felt like this movie could have been condensed to a short film at best. It was one of the most boring and unsatisfying movies I have ever watched. As in, 1 single fighting scene that comes near the end of the movie and features no actual combat, just a Muhammad Ali-esque display of domination. It was not fun, at all.. If you think you should give this movie a shot like I did, I want to do you a favor and let tell you that it is really and seriously not worth it.

I heard in the hallways in the theater, after the movie, that several people complained about this being the worst movie ever. I don't disagree.

The above is all I have to say about this applying film but IMDb says I have to write 10 lines. 😞 So I guess I'll go into a little bit of detail. I don't think Ryan's character's brothers should have died. I think they the severe beat down that he received at the hands of the murdered girl's father was enough. But hey that's just my opinion. And even if the writers decided that they still wanted his death, I don't think it should have the policeman administer this, it should have been the father. But the again this was the basis of the film...stupid. I'm also upset that the policeman did not receive his karma and instead got away with both the brothers murders. Both of the brothers sex preferences are just WEIRD. I must admit that Ryan Gosling acted very well in the little bit that I watched of this awful film, Only God Forgives.",Only God Forgives

If you enjoyed ""Drive"" and are OK with minimal dialogue and enjoy great storytelling through a visual realm, you will be treated to an amazing film. Another review I read somewhere described this as a neon-noir, which is a perfect name for this style that seems to be making its way into the film world now a days. A style of colorful neon lit scenes where deep color and dark shadows make up a majority of the film. Some people mention that the dialogue or lack thereof makes the film feel shallow, but this is a story in which the actions speak louder than words.Its a psycho-sexual puzzle that brings you into the world of broken people. The films does leave much for interpretation and from my understand of the end, which many have theories on, is that we all must be punished for our mistakes. In the end its a classic good vs. evil tale, in which we have all have evil in us, and sometimes the worst battles are those within ourselves.

I'm pretty sure that if you are going to see in the cinema, this film or worse on a Saturday night with your partner. That this is going to be a tedious Saturday!

I don't expect everyone to like this film - it is certainly not for fans of Hollywood blockbusters and those who start their reviews with statements similar to 'I went to see this movie because I like Ryan Gosling/Kristin Scott Thomas' render all further comments null and void - their opinions are simply worthless and cannot be taken seriously.The cinematography is excellent and the acting superb. Those complaining of Gosling's lack of animation are completely missing the point that his character is empty and completely subjugated beneath the force of his mother. This movie is full of symbolism, psychology and philosophy and every shot and sequence masterfully executes the portrayal and exploration of these themes. Distinct allusions to David Lynch are apparent but these do not come off as derivative but rather as homage. If you like Hollywood blockbusters or Rom-Coms stay away from this movie and don't bother deriding this movie due to your own lack of mature and critical thinking.

If you don't know Refn's movie you've got to know 3 important things : - He makes contemplative movies. With a lot of silence and a minimalist screenplay. - He said ""Art is an act of violence"" so don't expect to see a peaceful movie. - Drive is the least representative movie of his style.You'll need to create yourself a part of the story because it's a movie between reality and nightmare. It's a philosophical and metaphysical movie. A true experimental & artistic movie.This movie is fascinating ! Cinemathography is beautifully worked, use of the red light is perfect, framing also. Production design and the places make us perfectly return in the dark side of the film. We remain completely speechless front of the pictures that are beautiful, surprising and deeply disturbing. Violence becomes poetry.The story speaks about the male impotence, revenge is put on side, there is no real hero. Just the story of a lost man who seeks his way, other side a cop who thinks he is God. It's to the spectator to find the morals of the story.The music (electro-pop) and Vithaya's interpretations are in total agreement with the progression of the story and the pictures.The actors succeed in transmitting the feelings and impressions of the characters with simple glances.We leave the room completely disturbed, while being posed full with questions, trying to assimilate all the asked questions by the artist, but completely fascinated and excited !It is simple either one loves, or one hates this film.

481,adristok,Brilliant art of violence and a psychological mystery,8,4 June 2013,"This is a very good example of a movie that's hard to review. It's very strange and unusual, and also different from drive. It's easy to say that its too slow, makes little sense and that its way too much violence. I think this is a movie for people that sees artsy movies for what they are, which means few really loves it. But I do.The atmosphere and the visuals were fantastic! The beautiful dark red color that follows you trough the movie steals your attention from the very beginning. Refn is very fond of using violence as an art-form, which it is, if its used correctly. i liked the amount of violence, but i thought maybe it didn't need to be so graphic all the time. Personally I like the way Tarantino uses blood in Kill Bill better. Exaggerate the use of blood. instead of making it realistic, make it look like a trip to wonderland. An other thing I thought was negative, was that some scenes could be too long. Its great to be able to see things from Julien's (Ryan Gosling) view, but it could seem a little boring and unnecessary when it takes too much time off the movie. Some critics has said that its almost no dialogue's, but that is very much a part of the movie. its true, but the few sentences that is used as lines is more than enough to put a smile on your face, or blow you're mindI think its a must see for all who likes artsy movies in the form of death, blood or dark atmosphere.

485,Koidokus,"A film you watch, but aren't drawn into.",6,9 July 2013,"The idea for the film was, at a first glance, quite appealing to me; in contrary to the recent trend of story and character development having to be thrown in your face or acted out so blatantly obvious that every two-year-old can follow, Only God Forgives presents us a minimal storytelling, even minimal talking in general, and leans on the audience's patience and, hopefully, quick comprehension to work itself to the end and let it's story become clear.A beautiful concept, weren't it for the fact that whilst this all works out fine, you completely lose the feeling of watching a movie - as a viewer you have to pay so much attention to the plot, or rather every single frame that might reveal parts of the plot, that you won't ever get the time to just sit back, relax and let yourself get drawn into the movie. Furthermore, the film never provides a smooth, running scene, but is composed of short fragments where one or two actions, or happenings, are acted out slowly, with few words and overall as mysterious as can be to save the plot unveiling until the end. Again, this doesn't give the audience any chance to indulge themselves into the movie, they won't be able to compare themselves with the characters good enough and will, ultimately, have watched the movie, but not experienced it.All in all, the idea and setup for the movie was fine, and a refreshing thing to see, but sadly overdone. The result was something unique and away from the trend of easy-to-follow in-your-face movies, but it became the other end of the extreme and gained the severe downside of not being followed by the audience and they couldn't 'bond' with the movie and experience it.",Only God Forgives

People say slow, well if you compare it to the non stop action movies that keep coming out then yes. But I felt tension throughout the whole movie. Kubrick style throughout ,with disturbing mother son relationships that I think sig Freud would of had a field day with was overall very compelling.Chang 'god' was one of the scariest characters I have seen, the torture seen was one of the best/worst scenes I've seen in a movie. Can see why some people would walk out, I don't normally get squeamish , but I could barely watch. Ryan gosling was same character as in drive, but played perfectly. you could sense his psychopathic thoughts and see how submissive he was towards his mother. though you could see him change throughout movie, he was only one with a conscience.It was all strange, specially at the end with his mother, where my interpretation was he was reclaiming his life from her womb.

487,turney-spencer,God's Judgment,8,20 July 2013,"Alright. Deep breath. Here we go.I saw Drive. I loved Drive. Drive was emotional. Drive was cool. I walked out of that theater wanting to buy a denim jacket and knuckle-less driving gloves. It was a great feeling and I still love it. And as much as I told myself ""Okay, be realistic. This film is going to be different"", I was still hoping to see a toothpick.I can now safely say, THIS IS NOT THAT FILM.After reading up a tad bit on Refn and his style of directing, as well as his responses to the mass exodus at the screening at Cannes, I began to understand a little bit more about this film. It's polarizing. I went to see the film with three other people. Half of us loved it. The other two blamed us for making them sit through it. It's stylistic. The colors throb in your eye sockets. The camera is almost voyeuristic. Also, it's dirty. The violence is raw and gratuitous. Where Drive was cool, this film is schizophrenic. The score even interprets the same emotion. Sitting through the film, I kept wondering if Cliff Martinez had created a score for a horror movie. Then it hit me. He had. This film is the story of Evil personified and the one man who believes himself capable of judging the rest.After that long statement, I'll simply state that I thought the movie was fantastic. I looked at my review and analyzed it for signs of pretentiousness but I just kept coming back to the story. Critics whine about the plot, but I don't see how. It's almost TOO simplistic. Sure there are the hallucinatory flashbacks and detractive ""nothing"" scenes. But it's a boiled down plot - a short story, portrayed over a, somehow lengthy, 90 minutes.Pansringarm (who, by the way, somehow portrayed less emotion than Julian) played Chang as God figure straight. No BS. His job was judgment. HE decided who lived or died. On the other side of the spectrum, we have Crystal - the dark and deceptive mother of Julian and Billy. She serves as the Satan figure. She brings out the worst in those she associates with, whether it's the incestuous relationship with Julian or the way she attempts to betray him to Chang.What I don't understand is how critics can't grasp the symbolism. I haven't read a single review that talks about it. This movie has DEEP thematic elements, and while the plot is likewise schizophrenic the story is simple and emotional. If I were to suggest one element, it would be the symbol of Julian's hands. They are restrained, used to fight, used to kill, and ultimately used as a sacrifice. He is the everyman - pulled between two forces of nature.My suggestion? Do what you feel. I don't feel comfortable suggesting anyone see this film, simply because it is so polarizing. If you do decide to take a chance, bravo. It's in my top 5 of the year so far.",Only God Forgives
488,butchchastity,Pretty Colours,4,21 July 2013,"This follow up to Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' has some pleasing camera-work and pretty colours but somehow doesn't quite seem to work. Almost every shot goes on noticeably too long, and it feels cheap somehow, like a TV movie or a porno, though I'm at a loss to say exactly why or how. A good few of the actors - including Ryan Gosling, who is usually note-perfect - seem curiously stilted and out of place a lot of the time, perhaps this is just the result of filming in so foreign a clime.Having said that, though, there are some fine, haunting moments along the way, and Kristen Scott Thomas is in fine fettle throughout as the slightly incestuous (but still damn foxy) mother. And yes, Ryan is lovely to look at too, when he's not getting his face mashed in, but I miss the genius actor from Lars And The Real Girl or Blue Valentine. It certainly would be nice to hear him have more than three lines a film one of these days.As I say, the blood-red lighting, the textures, the camera lenses, sound, everything is in place for this to work but somehow it doesn't.

489,pikelss,Promoting terrible stereotypes!,1,22 July 2013,"Living in Thailand, I can tell you that many Thai people already assume that most (if not all) foreigners come to Thailand only to have sex with minors, sell and abuse drugs, and get into fights.This movie promotes all of those stereotypes. No twist. No attempt at showing any foreign character resembling a normal human being.This is for Thai people, what Django was for African Americans - except that slavery in America actually happened.Being unfamiliar with the situation in Thailand makes you think that this is just an odd artsy film. Knowing what a film like this can do to a Thai person who has had no contact with foreigners and already heard from stories that foreigners are all bad people, makes you sick to your stomach.Watch it or don't watch it, but if you're a Thai person, I hope you know better than to think that this movie is an accurate depiction of how foreign people think and act.And Ryan Gosling... wow, I honestly hope you know absolutely nothing about Thailand and that it was your ignorance that led you to taking part in this movie.",Only God Forgives
490,spennybones,Almost unforgivable...,4,23 July 2013,"""Only God Forgives"" is much like a Ferrari without an engine; it's stunning to look at... at least, that is, until you get into it and realize it's not taking you anywhere. This movie wasn't devoid of beauty; it as just a bit subtle. What it WAS devoid of was something I enjoy in movies; comprehensible dialogue, a storyline, and an ending.As a younger sibling, I know the sting of constantly being compared to your older brother. And I'm sure ""Only God Forgives"" would feel the same sting if it knew it were being compared to its somewhat more attractive and smarter brother, ""Drive""... but there's no way around it. As the father of his films, I just hope Refn pays special attention to the next sibling, 'cause the middle child appears to have been neglected.

I always research a film before going to see it, but I can see people who just popped by the theater without any prep might walk out after a while. I said to my wife it seemed like a cross between Twin Peaks and Blade Runner at times, with lots of long, slow beautiful scenes that may or may not mean something. The story line was fairly simple, a revenge tale with destruction of a dysfunctional family thrown in. Also ""bad"" people being punished but then Chang the cop doing much of the punishing was a pretty bad guy himself. Not much black and white at all in this film. The ""good"" guy who we are possibly supposed to root for, was a pretty bad person by most definitions, and the ""bad"" guy,(the cop) was apparently trying to restore order and was busy meting out tough punishment.

One thing is certain, neither Vithaya Pansringarm (Chang) nor Ryan Gosling (Julian) will ever get to even a Razzie with their performances. If I were to pick one over the other, it would be the former. At least his dead-pan expression had more character than 'Julian's.

The story itself is a fairly simple one, however it is told in a way in which depended heavily on the actors performance, and this is were the movie fails. the way some of the actors fail to act the parts almost like shadows of themselves, sometimes overacting and being too much aware of the camera detracts from Nicolas intentions. Gosling is good here, so is Kristin Scott Thomas, the rest of the cast is hit or miss in some scenes. The overall surreal way of telling this story could've worked a lot better if they had solved those issues. I liked the subtext behind the whole relationship between Chang (who in is own ways has a twisted God complex) and Julian's character.In the end it makes me a little sad, i think with a little more time put into working with the actors, it could've elevated the movie to another level, also without spoiling anything, i think the out of the box scenes could've been pushed a little more!! 7 out of 10!!",Only God Forgives

That sensibility and singularity of the film makes it special. The cinematography is astonishing, the way the DP works playing the lights and reflections, makes it a colorful movie with a message each time the colors of the background and the actors change, depending on the place and situation.It is a slow movie but definitely a recommendation for its visual impact.

Other, more articulate reviewers than me have come up with all sorts of reasons for the imagery and content and I take my hat off to them. For me it was mesmerising and impressively well acted. Gosling excels himself and rises above the mainstream actor. As for Scott Thomas - brilliant! I found it hard to believe it was her. I shall watch this again and maybe even again. Excellent.

497,shaiyra,"More of an art installation project, less of an enjoyable movie experience",7,31 July 2013,"Only God Forgives raises the question of how much of a movie an audience can stand to watch when it loves and respects an artist. Had the film featured lesser-known actors and an obscure director, it might have been booed off the screen for its superfluous gore and barely-there story. But, we not only give it a chance, we want and hope that it is brilliant. We love Drive and Nicolas Winding Refn, we love Ryan Gosling (yes, we do), and we love Kristen Scott Thomas. It's hard not to try and enjoy Only God Forgives out of stubborn loyalty. However (or perhaps as a consequence—?), Refn makes it a hard pill to swallow.The actual plot line is fairly straightforward. Billy (Tom Burke), the eldest son of a thoroughly unpleasant family, rapes and murders a young prostitute. The girl's father exacts revenge on Billy by killing him after he is tacitly instructed to do so by Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), our murderous cop. Soon after, Billy's mother, Crystal (Thomas), flies to Thailand from the United States and orders her younger son, Julian (Gosling), to avenge his brother's death. What follows is an odd and bloody back and forth of an eye for an eye.Only God Forgives is visually mesmerising and repulsive all at once. It is a canvas of perfect frames, a superb soundtrack, and stoic characters amidst the vibrant setting of Thailand's seedy underbelly. The stillness and stoniness of the characters reflects an across-the-board lack of goodness:There's Gosling's Julian: described as ""Hamlet-esque"" by some reviewers, he is paralysed with fear of his own anger and evil, thus driven to impotency. There may not be a phenomenal amount of acting skill required, but Gosling works perfectly in the role, taking on a different version of his character from Drive. Gosling's character is caught between two super-villains, each the other's opposite racially, gender-wise, and expressively. Thomas plays her role fantastically as chain-smoking Crystal who oozes rage and instability and recklessly orders the murders of others. Meanwhile, Pansringarm rarely speaks and barely flexes a facial muscle, save to smile sadistically before slicing off whatever appendage of his victims, whom he always deals with himself. Given the potential for character development, a frustratingly small amount is carried out. Though plot, personality, and background are presented in the film through somewhat subtle methods, none of the characters is particularly expanded upon, and most relationships are hinted at but never unveiled. Crystal and Julian's implied Oedipus complex and murdered father, Chang's missing wife and Kung-Fu Master-level sword skills Just as much of the film remains in shadow, so do all of the characters. This can be problematic given the extremes that we are asked to watch. An audience deserves some juicy plot or character dynamism if it sits through a man putting his hand inside his mother's womb, or another driving an ice pick into someone's ear. Speaking of ice picks and open wombs, I can confidently say that I am usually very good with gore and violence. Only God Forgives, however, is the first movie in recent years to force my eyes shut. Nonetheless, one gets the impression that all the carnage and bloodshed isn't just torture porn. There are many moments when the audience feels confused as to how we're being prompted to react. Examples: include the fact that Pansringarm is able to pull out a sword from his back that is deliberately shown as blade-less; the way in which he finds an absurd amount and variety of blades in a private club room with which to torture his victim; Gosling's casual ""wanna fight?"" followed by an unequivocal defeat to the soundtrack of an awesome fight scene These moments, among others, coupled with the melodrama, painful suspense, and stomach-churning violence make many scenes almost comic. And yet, although the unabashed, full frontal violence brings Tarantino to mind, it is displayed with such rawness and seriousness, that you aren't able to laugh off your repulsion. In fact, you're never really given a break from your ball-fisted anxiety. Even the scenes that feature sensuality and the promise of sex are never really sexy, because the dreaded anticipation of spilled blood remains heavy – like a layer of grime over each immaculately shot scene. The inability to really understand or predict the plot only heightens that fear. One feels as if anything could happen and it would still somehow fit in the story line, especially as the gap between reality and hallucination shrinks. It is no surprise that critics are so divided about the movie, but I wouldn't call it a ""you hate it or love it"" experience. Tim Grierson from Paste says, it might ""almost work better as an art installation""; it's possible to appreciate the film for the skill with which it's made without necessarily being an out-and-out fan. Only God Forgives is beautifully shot, but gruesome without having comedy or deeper meaning as justification.While I can't say I particularly enjoyed watching it, I'm glad I did. It's a movie to divide viewers and provoke reaction. A visual feast for lovers of cinematography, but certainly not a film for the faint-hearted.",Only God Forgives
498,bobrichmond-753-672124,Gratuitous violence and poor direction,1,1 August 2013,The plot is very simple but is executed at an almost dirge like pace with virtually no dialogue and over dramatic music. The violence is gratuitous in the extreme and the move from one scene to the next is not well executed and leaves the watcher confused. I honestly believe this was a major mistake for Ryan Gosling who until this film seems to have been blessed with good scripts and compelling characters. The casting of Gosling's mother was also quite weird and totally unbelievable and the attempts by the director (can I really call him that??) to suggest some dark relationship between the mother and her sons was crudely executed and totally unbelievable. I thoroughly hated the film but watched it until its ridiculous end in the vain hope that it may just have some redeeming aspect. It did not!!,Only God Forgives

It has a massive lack of storyline and one song on repeat as the theme music, the main redeeming feature of the entire film is the multiple and pointless scenes of Thai karaoke. Along with Ridiculously unnecessary gore it means that this film is basically 90 minutes of people not really talking much, turning around rather slowly in an attempt to be dramatic, walking down red-lit corridors again slowly and revenge killing each other in poor lighting conditions with ancient outdated weapons. Do not see this film on the assumption that it may be similar to 'Drive' because its not. Obviously trying to be Art-house and failing massively, this is a complete waste of time and money. Ryan gosling basically plays the same character as in 'Drive' where he's far too cool to talk and spends most of his scenes clenching his fists and jaw.

Very flimsy, if non existent storyline and poor acting (if you can even call it that, Gosling spends most of the film staring into space). No emotion, barely any talking, just a very odd and frankly rubbish character to give an actor who has been so good in other films! And as for the karaoke that is randomly inserted for prolonged periods in the middle of the film, well I have no idea what it has to do with the already weak storyline! So, If you enjoy watching bizarre snippets of karaoke mixed in with some blood and gore then this is right up your street!

When we listen to a song, we expect a melody. When we see a painting, we expect a meaning behind it. So when the average person listens to a song in the noise genre, they immediately reject it, as there is no melody, no song structure. When the painting we see has no meaning, it leaves us unfulfilled, and even sometimes upset. So when we walked into only god forgives, the majority of us expected something very similar to drive, but that is not the case.What we have here instead, is a slow paced revenge film. Unlike what most negative reviews say, there is in fact a plot. Gosling's brother dies, and the mother comes into town to seek revenge. The plot is so simple, some people might believe there isn't one, as they may be used to intricate twists and elaborate stories. Alongside the simple story, lies a deep underlying theme which involves the overbearing mother, the godlike retired cop, and gosling's character. This underlying theme is of a man who wants to escape from his mothers overbearing grasp. We see this theme come up many times in what other negative reviewers call, ""pointless scenes"". Gosling's lack of dialogue in the movie really invoke this underlying theme as well as the soundtrack and scenery. Speaking of which, the soundtrack is very moody and haunting, and the way the movie is shot is just so breathtaking. Those two things, accompanied with the theme and the main story, make this movie something very special.This whole film really has something to say, if you look deeper into it. It is easy to call this movie pretentious, as its message may not be clear at first, but there is indeed a message. There is also many reviews here that claim this movie is extremely violent, which made me expect a gorefest. While there is some gore and violence, it really isn't overwhelming so you shouldn't let it deter you from seeing it. This is certainly not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy David lynch and the way you have to analyze his films after its done, you will definitely enjoy this.",Only God Forgives

And why did some members of the cast appear on a stage in a dodgy looking club, singing songs, in Thai, throughout the film? The film was very violent, most of it gratuitous.

If you don't like CGI don't go watch a Michael Bay movie similar to Winding Refn; If you don't like Gore don't go watch a film by Refn. As we saw in 'Drive' his style of gore is brutal and unrelenting and what it needs to be in cinema. Anyway the film; set around the cold and not so calculated, Julian (Ryan Gosling) a drug smuggler exiled to Bangok (Thailand)is tasked by his Psychotic mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) to find and bring to 'Refn' style justice the person responsible for the death of Her son. without giving to much away about the plot.

506,RobocopFromMars,People should be familiar with his body of work before seeing this movie. He does not do conventional movies. Which is awesome,8,27 August 2013,"To me, this film was great. I have liked almost every one of Winding Refns films so I did not have false expectations going in. That is what I think the reason people do not like his work, because they are expection something else. Winding Refns main characters are often anti-villains with an already set destiny that is bad. They try to change it but they fail because of their natural way of being bad. And his films often tend to tell the story trough camera angles and body language, rather then dialouge. Which I think is an awesome and a fresh way of approaching filmmaking. The stories themself are often very ""weird"" so to speak, they have some sort of surrealism about them. And are very brutal and bizarre. Just something you have to accept in the realm of the film. His films are never just ""sit down and get entertained"", they demand that you focus and pick up on the details. Only God Forgives is no exception.Since I knew what I was going to get, my mind was set for this movie. And I loved it all they. Some bumps along they way but overall it was great. Gosling does an okey job, not perfect but I liked it. Kristin Scott Thomas was pretty bad ass as well. Even the ending which some people thought was weird, I saw as completely justified/believable.I get it if people do not like this movie, it is not for everybody.

507,myowntrumpet,A mesmerising visual experience,8,26 August 2013,"Only God Forgives.Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Only God Forgives' is like a long, slow and hideous acid trip punctuated by conversation. As a visual experience it is mesmerising, while the reluctance with which it reveals its story verges on the maddening. Ryan Gosling plays a drug dealer in Thailand, Kristen Scott Thomas is his mother who demands action from him after the death of his brother. Vithaya Pansringarm is their opposition, a feared Thai police officer implacable in his mission to combat crime. The film moves with determined slowness, taking the viewer on a dark journey through Bangkok's underworld. Refn eschews dialogue whenever possible, only allowing his characters to speak when it is necessary for the audience's understanding of the plot. Instead he uses long, drawn out sequences to create a mood of increasing tension and inevitability as the movie inches towards its climax. Gosling haunts the film like a ghost, employing his ability to express nothing while conveying everything. Thomas, as the matriarch, is imperious and terrifyingly immoral while Pansringarm moves with the deliberate, phlegmatic manner of Gus Fring from TVs 'Breaking Bad'.

The visual artistry was good that I was almost definitely sure something eventful and worth-the-wait would happen. Then I got bored, grabbed the remote and hit forward. The actors/actresses perfectly fit their characters. The script, while there wasn't much, was okay.

Trying really hard to follow this movie can quickly lead to snoring.I watch through movies, even bad ones, to see to the end of the plot. Watching this one proved difficult for me. This movie's entire plot could easily be played out in 20 minutes of film if they had sped up the pace. Many scenes made me wonder if the director forgot to say action as there was no movement. And sequences that were already slow were shown in slow-mo, dragging the pace down even more.Some of the images were a little visually interesting but red tones were excessive, which is saying a lot when it comes from someone who loves the color red. And the shots linger too long so the slight interest in the imagery is quickly lost.The music choices did not help maintain viewer interest. Slow sections that would have benefited from a fast paced song to carry to the next scene had slow music and sections that seemed to require a more slow serene music had a slightly faster paced song. I don't recall any of the music being particularly fast either which made the entire movie drag even more.Plot, pace, imagery, music, all were disappointing. The lack of expressions and movement did not provide a connection to the characters. There is a chance this movie might appeal to those that like esoteric artsy films, but there are better choices for artsy films. This is not a film I would recommend. The reason I give it more than one star is because it does manage to have a plot. Believe it or not, I have seen worse.",Only God Forgives

Ryan Gossling is there, there are generally very few words being said and its beautifully shot. But to me watching ""Only God Forgives"" makes me think more of one of Refns early work, ""Bleeder"" (1999). The two movies share the fascination with ""ultraviolence"", even though it seems that it is Refn himself that has the fascination this time rather then the main character. Thankfully Refn succeeds a lot better this time exploring the subject. Where ""Bleeder"" was all over the place and didn't seem to follow any direction what so ever, this movie, while being quite unconventional, feels really focused and keeps you on the edge of your seat. So if you can handle quite a bit of blood (so you wont end up with your hands over your eyes the whole movie like my girlfriend) I would definitely recommend you giving ""Only God Forgives"" a chance.

The script really has nothing going for it and I hope we can all agree on that. There isn't very much dialogue, but when there is it's very dull and drab. Nobody seems to truly want to be in this movie. Refn has slowly focused less and less on this throughout his career. I loved the dialogue in Bronson and it gave me a few laughs. Drive was a step down but there were still some quotable phrases, but there was nothing intriguing about what anybody was saying here. What I found most troubling about this movie was the fact that there wasn't much feeling put into it. There weren't any moments that I felt particularly happy, or even sad for that matter. After an hour got by I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters. Now so far it seems as though I've been ripping this to shreds, but there are in fact some real positives in this. Particularly the screenplay. It's hypnotic. The color palette fit the mood and it puts you in a trance. All of the scenery is very well thought out and it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Overall, this movie would have been one of the greatest films of all time if Refn decided to add some emotion and humor. But instead we're stuck with a beautiful pile of mostly boring scenes.",Only God Forgives

Turns out this movie is literally unwatchable. Yeah the cinematography is good, but the story makes no sense. Gosling is the main character and doesn't have a line for a good hour in the movie. its just a bunch of scenes where he is staring at the camera. I thought he must have taken a bet with someone that he could star in a movie where he doesn't say a single line. At one point he watches a girl pleasuring herself on a bed before he walks into a room and a guy with a sword cuts his hand off, but supposedly it was just a dream. I don't know, I just know nothing was explained at all. I don't need the plot spoon fed to me, but I get the feeling this was a movie too far up its own artistic butt to notice what a pile of crap it was... just my opinion.

I appreciate great cinematography and character development. Sadly The latter does not exist even in the slightest bit in this movie. From the beginning I had no idea who the hand chopping, sword wielding Vithaya Pansringarm was. To me he was some random guy who the police called in to take care of a brutal scene. Up until I Googled the movie to get more details I thought he was some cop who was judge, jury, and executioner. I loved the scenes and landscapes but I cannot for the life of me understand what the director was thinking when he made this. The story moves sooo slow that it felt like I was sitting watching it for hours. The story also made ZERO sense to me. Why in the world would a supposed kingpin drug smuggler even worry about a guy like Vithaya Pansringarm character. I mean lets be real here, they had lots of money. In the the real world there are more efficient ways of dealing with people. The way the movie was setup I felt like I was watching one of those generic movies where the character hears some craziness in the next room and instead of getting out of there (which in real life would happen) they decide to go inside and get killed. This movie made me so mad that I actually decided to write a review of how terrible it was. Who knows maybe that's what the director was looking for? trying to get a cerebral rise out of the audience?

At multiple points during this film I felt like just turning it of and walking away. I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I thought it could only get better as it went along, oh I couldn't have been so wrong.Ryan Gosling's character was so dull, in many of his scenes he moved very slowly which the director said was to make it look ""as if the actors are performing a ballet"". He didn't achieve this effect at all. The combination of his constant dull, emotionless expression and the slow movement made him looked like he had been drugged and had no idea what he was doing. It was laughable and not at all beautiful, which is how the director intended it.The violence was too frequent, graphic and quite unnecessary. Don't get me wrong, violence in films can work very well (Tarantino shows us that). But in this film it made me feel very uncomfortable, as if i had some across a sick, twisted fantasy of a perverted murderer.Kristen Scott Thomas was very good in this, she played her role excellently and her character was very interesting. Sadly the rest of the film lacked so much that she alone could not save it.The cinematography was very good, beautiful scenes and very well filmed.

But it is my interpretation, it fits the way I consider revenge. Yet I believe most people will answer 1- to both questions.Another thing: why is the cop (with the blade) never dressed as a cop?

Substance is not one I dare to engage in with other viewers; as I believe this to be a preference of both the filmmaker and the viewer. In that same vein I operate with the personal conviction that rare Directors are able to successfully parlay Style into becoming the substance of a motion picture experience...which is what Drive did for me.

528,hugo-everard,A bizarre journey into the meaning of revenge. Or just Bangkok at it's most nightmarish.,10,8 April 2014,"People will hate this movie. It revels in long shots where almost nothing happens followed by explosions of horrific violence. Or at least that's what I believe most professional reviewers talk about anyway, Peter Bradshaw for The Guardian being the only exception that I have found.And I am with Peter. This film is mesmeric, hypnotic and so abundant with crazy metaphor (some of which I am sure is merely my own interpretation and completely against what Refn intended) that I couldn't help but be pulled in.So let's start with the obvious. This is Nicolas Winding Refn film with Ryan Gosling in which Ryan Gosling barely speaks at all where the characters commit or are involved in acts of unspeakable violence. Drive has exactly the same formula. And people hated that movie (counting my friends as well as some as some internet critics I have read) as well. So, if you don't like Drive, found it boring or too violent, you will not like Only God Forgives. Only God Forgives is about revenge the way Drive was about alienation and loneliness. I don't want to spoil the storyline because some of it is left up to interpretation. However, rest assured, in this universe, in Bangkok, do NOT got on a rampage of vengeance. Anyway, the story is told in an almost magical fairy-tale/dream like state which makes the film ooze with foreboding (it is dedicated to Alejandro Jodorowsky, so if you've seen films by him, you get the idea). Cliff Martinez's score is a mixture of bassy pounds, hard hitting synths, emotive strings and dread inducing expressionistic orchestral textures that add to the atmosphere in a way that I am sure fans of Drive will appreciate. I personally think the score is better, but hey that's my opinion. The film is beautiful visually. It oozes reds, whites, blues and greens in the backdrop which add to the nightmarish hallucinogenic atmosphere. The city of Bangkok is seething and the film shows it with relish. There are lots of tracking shots that switch direction giving the movie it's flow. Some of the scenes are colour-coded in a way that will make Breaking Bad colour theorists (again, what I read on the internet) cream themselves. I have only talked about the style. So what? If it doesn't have a good story what's the point? Part of the story is what you bring to it, it is deliberately open-ended and that might frustrate some viewers, but for all of you who want to see something truly bizarre, threatening and beautiful, bolstered by great performances from the cast (yes, there is a reason why Gosling is so distant in this movie) with standout mention to Kristin Scott Thomas as being the most evil horrible diabolical mother... well, you get the idea, then give it a shot. It is only 80 mins or something. However, I should say, it is really, really violent. And if you hate karaoke then I would run a mile. :)",Only God Forgives

As it turned out, the explained better plot made it all come together in my head, and i loved it and couldn't stop thinking about it for days. re watching it, it completely all makes sense, but once again even though i can see it now, on first view most of the details were confusing so for that i have to give it a little bit of a lower rating because you want to love the movie the first time you watch it, not when its explained better to you. the movie should do that.

If you fail to see the significance of these ""weird"" scenes (I'm speaking mostly about Ryan Gosling's interactions with a whore), I think you fail to see the most important part of this film - the characters and their expected roles vs. their actual roles.This film has a very slow pace, so any discussion of the editing would be a matter of debate. Some would say it is perfect, while some would say it needs a faster pace. I can agree with either side, but just make sure you're not sleepy going into this film. I had the unfortunate experience of seeing ""Valhalla Rising"" while sleepy. That was a great film, with a faster pace than this one, but (like all Refn films I have seen) it was at least borderline slow-paced.The cinematography, as always in a Refn film, is very nice - beautiful colors, and nice composition. Any screenshot from this film is proof of the great composition.I don't really notice acting unless it is bad - which is not the case here.The music, as always from Cliff Martinez, was very good - the music in the fight scene was outstanding.Don't go into this movie sleepy; don't expect a Hollywood thrill ride. This is a slow, methodical statement of a film. I won't tell you what I think that statement is, but it is there - the ultimate roles of the characters do the explaining.I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film unlike the usual Hollywood mold, who can stay alert through slow pacing, and who can allow him or herself to critically view the roles of different characters (who is what and why).***I only gave it a 10 to help kick its rating up a notch - 5.8 is far too low.

Acceptable. However, ten minutes into the story I really started to doubt my selection. At this point I could have stopped, but thought I would tough it out and see if it got any better. Unfortunately, it did not.What I liked about the movie was the Blueray cover. Nice graphics can be so seducing don't you think?What I did not like about the movie was the strange plot, strange treatment and stranger acting. It really made me wonder why a big name like Ryan Gosling did this one? The movie is set against an incredulous backdrop of modern Bangkok. I live in Asia and spend a few years there. I don't think this maelstrom portrayal of this city; their police force; or the 'farangs' (white foreigners) that live there does it any favours either.

For me there was no real storyline, no real acting, what looked like a one hundred dollar wardrobe and a two hundred dollar set, lots of staring off into space as a substitute for constructive dialogue.

Way too much, in my opinion. While it certainly isn't as good as Drive, it doesn't try to do the same thing. It is a semi-dreamlike, visionary view on the life of a drug-dealer, who carries the burden of murdering his own father (with his bare hands, by the way). The scenes in which Julian, the main character, looks at his hands, have a meaning (although many people seem to judge them as pointless and boring). The images in this movie are amazing, and at least as good as those in Drive, if not better. The plot is hard to understand at first, but once you think about it, it really makes sense (even though you gotta think really hard about it). I personally don't mind the slow pace, because it reflects the main character's view of the world better. Although it has some flaws, as to the understandability of the movie, I really enjoyed Only God Forgives and see it as a in many way beautiful, although brutal, story about mothers and children, violence, guilt, revenge, belief, justice, and redemption. While this is certainly not a movie for your average movie-night with friends, cinema-lovers who like to interpret stories of their own without having everything spoon-fed to them, might really enjoy this movie.

This is IMO, by the way. There's something no one can deny of the film, and it's that the cinematography is wonderful, and tonally accurate. The characters where interesting (yes, even Julian). Why? It's like Valhalla Rising, where the main character never says a single word, but it's still have an interesting character arc. There are some artistic values that can be interpreted with that lack of words, and the relation with the rest of the characters (Chang being God, and Crystal being temptation, on my interpretation). Now, I was OK with the violence, and knowing the subject matter, it seems rare to me that people were impressed. I mean, it's not Forrest Gump. Just for the main title you should know, that there will be nasty stuff. But the most important thing, is that the film needs in fact multiple viewings. Maybe because it has some layers. Perhaps I'm over interpreting, but that's just because the film actually allows me to. Anyways it's a worth seeing film, if you can deconstruct it and reconstruct it just to interpret the meanings towards the central themes (and the subplots).",Only God Forgives

It tries to get to the audience in a different way, and should be applauded for its uniqueness. However, you still can't deny the fact that it is flat and does not have enough material.I also think that some of the very important themes behind the story(such as sexuality) are not given enough details and instead too much time wasted on other meaningless endeavours.So this movie does have its flaws, but its presentation and unique message deliver to you that mixed feelings towards its main characters - you get behind them at one moment then totally despise them the next. I don't remember any one film that managed to do this so perfectly, in the last 10 years.

Particularly well shot, the film is consistently beautiful and atmospheric. However, the films pros also produce the cons - suffering from a lack of dialogue; the streets of the movie are largely silent, with characters ridiculously silent and contemplative. I began to wonder if the director just didn't have anything to say; perhaps he left the script on the bus, as the film feels 'empty' for much of the time. Brief scenes of violence are well shot and just about maintain the interest level, Despite the David lynch -esque aura of mystique, which does work in places, no satisfaction is offered, with a ridiculously disappointing and pointless ending that is dropped in to quash any thought of pleasing the audience or offering up a single piece of positive resolution.

542,mentalmonkey57,Not like Drive but well done,9,20 July 2013,"First of all, this movie is nothing like Drive, despite bringing back together the leading forces that made Drive a cult hit: Nicolas Winding Refn, Ryan Gossling and Cliff Martinez. In ""Only God Forgives"", the viewer is presented, instead, an even hollower character than the driver in Drive. Julian, played by Ryan Gossling, is the brother of a rapist and killer; he is a drug dealer using a Thai boxing club as a front. Unlike Drive, however, the viewer knows the character's background; that is, it is fairly obvious to see why Julian acts the way he does. Most importantly, this film is best approached in psychoanalytical standpoint-very Freudian. By doing so, one could see that this film is truly remarkable, very artsy and, as always, Refn is really good with his setting and his direction. Symbolism is another asset that should be taken into account when watching this film because the entire film is enveloped with it, and, if you pay attention, you'll realize that this film is much more than the critics give it credit for. Another important facet in the film is Chang, played by Vithaya Pansringarm who is the film's ""villain"", at least in Julian's eyes which brings up another point: who really is the protagonist and antagonist in ""Only God Forgives"": Chang, the morally-just, righteous individual, or Julian, the flawed, empty, and violent young man who is trying to avenge his brother and live up to his castrating mother's (played hauntingly well by Kristen Scott Thomas) expectations. Either way, I recommend this film for the solitary movie enthusiast because this is not a film you watch with friends to pass the time. No, this film requires your undivided attention in order for the viewer to appreciate it. Now, reviewing the inner-workings of the film, the cinematography was beautiful; the score was good; the acting was great, especially Pansringarm and Gossling who, as always, does a very good job with his expressionless face. Overall, I enjoyed this film; however, this only happened after I watched it, when I went over the little details that I thought were pointless, but were, in fact, very useful in piecing together this film because, this is one of those films- the ones that require the viewer to actually think in order to understand it.",Only God Forgives
543,zayanda-04166,The more you hate it the more I like it,10,12 July 2021,"Simply not an Hollywood movie, that's why I love it, great soundtrack as well!!",Only God Forgives
544,iguana-54927,Wish I had read the reviews...,1,29 May 2019,"Definitely slow paced, pretentious, and to be fair the movie tried too hard to be dark, moody, cinematic and arty...
Slow, dreary, no dialogue, just actors staring into space. Instead of voice it was left for the viewer to decifer what was being said by the actors eyes or posture. Don't bother. Look for the 1984 classic ""Dune"" if you want to see a dark, moody and honestly a weird film.",Only God Forgives
545,unsc-88280,Snooze on,3,25 December 2018,This movie would have had me asleep had it not been for the interspersed ultra-violent gore scenes which seem to be the only plot developments me get. Beautiful shots and camera work but that is IT. I feel zero sympathy or connection to any of these characters. Don't waste your time. Watch Drive instead.,Only God Forgives
546,rspdiver,Move over Clint...,7,2 June 2018,"This cop makes Dirty Harry look like a tree-hugging pacifist. Dark and brooding, with lots of Oedipiean undertones, it's an interesting foreign study on criminal family vs. bad cop/worse cop...in the name of justice. Like Longmire...inThailand...and this Walt has no Fs to give.",Only God Forgives
547,singh_abhi,Only viewers forgive!!,7,3 June 2018,"It is difficult to fathom why a star actor like Ryan Gosling would act in a low budget, Thailand based B grade movie like this one...But after watching the movie for a few minutes one gets sucked into the underbelly of a Tourist hub like Bangkok..Special mention to the performance of the lady playing Ryan's mother...Class act..",Only God Forgives
548,gregoryhmay,The Longest 90 Minutes of my life,1,3 August 2018,"Remember when you were in grade school and an hour seemed like a long time. Well this movie brings me back to grade school. I don't need to add much to what's already been said but yes I'm one of the ignorant ones who can't read into all of the ""symbolism"" or rubbish that this movie tends to portray. Is slowly walking down a hallway in slow motion supposed to be symbolic of something? And if it is, does anybody care? How about some scenes where the actors look at each other emotionless for what seems like an eternity. Is that supposed to be the time where we are supposed to be interpreting what's going on in the actors' heads? There was no acting in this movie. Just a bunch of automatons, putting together a movie that does not even peak enough interest to read into the ""symbolism"" of the movie if there is any at all. HORRIBLE",Only God Forgives
549,cruzincat-1,I can't give it a zero,1,27 October 2013,"I've never seen Drive and now I know I never will if this movie is being compared to it. I will never watch a movie if I know it has been directed by this director, named Refn, either.If you are not a Ryan Gosling fan or a Kristan Scott Thomas fan, you might like to watch their careers go down a notch after making this film. I wonder how much they had to be paid to appear in it.It was so slow with little or no dialog, we found we could fast forward through many portions and we don't feel we missed anything. And the karaoke scene at the end was a total surprise when the credits started appearing as we fast forwarded through it. Actually at that point we were relieved it was finally over!I don't see how anyone could check the spoiler box in their review. This movie could never be spoiled or made worse than it it is already.",Only God Forgives
