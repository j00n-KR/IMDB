0,TheLittleSongbird,A fine film,9,9 March 2011,"As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film.My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise.Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch.The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant.In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Hamlet
1,Leofwine_draca,"Long, but good",9,19 September 2021,"Tough to watch this one at the cinema due to the length. Otherwise, though, I loved it. One of my favourite Shakespeare adaptations. Branagh knows what he's doing here and has assembled a great cast who go through the motions with real finesse. Sumptuous production values too. A bit overlong, sure, but this time it works.",Hamlet
2,SnoopyStyle,grand reinterpretation,7,9 November 2015,Prince of Denmark Hamlet (Kenneth Branagh) return home for his father's funeral and his mother (Julie Christie)'s quick wedding to his uncle (Derek Jacobi). He is haunted by the ghost of his father who his uncle was the murderer. Lord Chamberlain Polonius is suspicious of Hamlet. Hamlet kills him in a mistake. Polonius' daughter and Hamlet's love Ophelia (Kate Winslet) is driven mad.Kenneth Branagh has placed this classic Shakespearean play in the 19th century. There is a steam railroad train. The setting is grander than the usual drab rainy moody Denmark. It's all very well done. He plays Hamlet not quite as a moody dour personality. I prefer Hamlet maddenly depressed introvert. Branagh's a big time show man and this is a big showcase of big time actors.,Hamlet
3,Prismark10,Prince of Denmark,7,20 December 2015,"Kenneth Branagh's epic Hamlet which was a full adaptation of the whole text and clocks in at 4 hours. It is not for the faint hearted and it took me 17 years to finally unwrap my video of Hamlet and put in on the solitary video player I still have in the house.As a viewer you need stamina for one of Shakespeare's most popular tragedy. Branagh as director and adapter has brought the play forward to the 19th century and got a cast of American and British actors with cameos from Jack Lemmon, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal.He brings together the cream of British acting with Richard Attenborough, John Gielgud, Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and some Branagh regulars.Branagh himself gives a muscular performance in the background of a baroque set design. He imbues a sense of rawness but maybe overdo's the moments when he is humorous when he should had a nifty lightness of touch.Kate Winslet as Ophelia brings a moving portrayal as a young woman in love with the brooding Hamlet and who has engaged in a full physical relationship with him.The text can be fast and furious and as your hear it those many familiar lines zip by but that is how Shakespeare is. Language that is natural of its time and has to be natural to the actors reciting it now.The film has flaws. There are stylistic clashes from its cosmopolitan cast. The full play is not always easy to follow and the great fortitude is required to watch the whole film.",Hamlet
4,classicsoncall,"""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.""",9,18 May 2018,"I quite enjoyed this adaptation of Shakespeare's most famous play. Moving the characters and locations into the Nineteenth Century might be a bit hard for purists to take but I thought it worked wonderfully. Not being a student of Shakespeare and having never read 'Hamlet', it was intriguing to see how some of Shakespeare's memorable phrases and quotes are used in context, such as my summary line above from Marcellus (Jack Lemmon), or when Polonius (Richard Briers) states to Laertes (Michael Maloney) - ""This above all, to thine own self be true..."". The film is passionate in it's tale of murder, corruption and revenge and one can feel the rage emanating from the principals as the story progresses.The principal characters are all helmed by terrific actors and Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet is superb in his interpretation, as are Derek Jacobi portraying Claudius and Julie Christie as Gertrude. The celebrity filled cast is at the same time both surprising and in some cases distracting. Jack Lemmon and Charlton Heston virtually melt into their roles, though for modern audiences, the appearance of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams seems both out of place and out of character. One could also say the same for Kate Winslet as Ophelia, though if one is not as familiar with those players, the effect would not be as off-putting. With a finale that almost approaches that of an action thriller, this version of ""Hamlet"" is more than entertaining for a modern day update. If one enjoys Shakespeare's eloquent exposition of the English language, you can do no better than this film, as one can only marvel at the way the players deliver their lines flawlessly and with ease.",Hamlet
5,gavin6942,Branagh Doing What He Does,7,7 April 2015,"Hamlet (Kenneth Branagh), Prince of Denmark, returns home to find his father murdered and his mother remarrying the murderer, his uncle. Meanwhile, war is brewing.The film received four Academy Award nominations for the 69th Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Tim Harvey), Best Costume Design (Alexandra Byrne), Best Original Score (Patrick Doyle), and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) (Kenneth Branagh).However, it was not a box office success, grossing just under $5 million on a budget of $18 million. This is hardly surprising. The film is what might be called ""an achievement"", and certainly the new, definitive version for scholars and fans of Shakespeare. But to get a general audience to a Shakespeare film is hard (unless you disguise it as ""10 Things I Hate About You"") and to sit for a daunting four hours is also a challenging task.",Hamlet
6,lee_eisenberg,there's more than a few surprises here,10,27 March 2018,"""Hamlet"" remains probably William Shakespeare's most famous play. The story of a Danish prince who seeks revenge for his father's murder has been an undeniable part of literature for over 400 years, and has gotten filmed numerous times. Laurence Olivier's Academy Award-winning 1948 version shortened the story - going so far as to eliminate some characters - and is thus seen as more of an analysis of the play. But Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version features the entire play, and is an epic in the true sense of the word.On the one hand, a lot of it comes across as comical due to the appearances of Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams (I kept expecting Williams to launch into a whimsical monologue). But the performances of Branagh, as well as Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet keep the movie serious. Over the course of four hours, the movie explores humanity in all its futility as Hamlet finds out the truth behind his father's murder and starts planning vengeance.I wouldn't call the movie a full masterpiece - it does drag in places - but I appreciate the effort that Branagh put into it, and the cast gives it their all. I recommend it. Who would've ever imagined John Hammond, Lara Antipova, Sammy Davis Jr, Aunt May, Ben-Hur, Felix Unger and Adrian Cronauer all starring in an adaptation of a Shakespeare play together?PS: Early in his career, Robin Williams had a quote that went something like ""TV or not TV? Whether 'tis nobler to do kiddie crap or sweat my ass off at 9 in the morning.""",Hamlet
7,jboothmillard,Hamlet,6,7 September 2005,"Apparently the full uncut version of Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is meant to be four hours long, but on the video I saw it was only two. It is quite a good version of William Shakespeare's classic story about a man troubled by his father's spirit, or something. It has an all star cast including Branagh himself as Hamlet, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Brian Blessed as the Ghost, Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as English Ambassador (long version), Richard Briers as Polonius, Julie Christie as Gertrude, Billy Crystal as First Gravedigger, Judi Dench as Hecuba (long version), Gérard Depardieu as Reynaldo (long version), Ken Dodd as Yorick, Charlton Heston as Player King, Jack Lemmon as Marcellus and Robin Williams as Osric. The two hour version is good! I do kind of want to see the full four hour version. Good!",Hamlet
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Lavish Production, But Strange Casting & Who Wants To Hear King James English?",4,4 August 2007,"Many will disagree with this point but this film fails on one major point: few people today, if any, want to hear King James English spoken. Who wants to strain to understand what the actors are saying, and strain for four hours! Are you kidding me? No wonder this film bombed, except for big fans of Shakespeare. To make it even worse, the lead actor, Kenneth Branagh, speaks in a whisper half the time.Actually, the casting in this Shakespeare classic is mind-boggling; some good, some bad and some very questionable. I mean, comedian Billy Crystal?The most embarrassing performance is by a Hall-of-Fame type actor, the great Jack Lemmon. What is Lemmon doing playing this role? He must have wondered the same thing, but he looked like he could care less. I have never heard him deliver lines in such wooden fashion. If you didn't know it was him, you would have thought they dragged some poor idiot off the street to handle the role.Yes, it's a visual feast, and I appreciated that, but it's too much of everything, almost gaudy in its presentation. Some say all of that reflects Branagh's ego. I don't know; you might ask Emma Thompson about what goes on inside Branagh's brain, not that he isn't intelligent and done some good work. To be fair, I just wish I had more patience with the King James English. Had I been, perhaps I would have enjoyed this lavish production.",Hamlet
9,Quinoa1984,the best 'epic-length' English-language adaptation of the Bard,10,6 October 2008,"Hamlet is nothing short than an epic work, of theater-literature-drama, and its quintessential story of revenge and love and the haunting sense of life and death always in the balance is unique unto itself. It's so repeated and ripped-off and homaged- not counting the actual film adaptations by Olivier and Zeferelli- it's hard to figure on a fresh take (even my once favorite animated Disney movie, the Lion King, wouldn't exist without it). Kenneth Branaugh has figured on an angle that works magnificently: adapt the entire full-length play, including parts not included in the *original* released play until in the late 17th century, and fill it with an all-star cast of British thespians and some Americans, and film it in an accessible manner for a 1990's audience. It's almost flawless as performance, and nearly mind-blowing as an example of film-making prowess.Need I repeat the story? Hamlet's father dies- is killed, actually- and returns to him as a ghost, telling him that it was Claudius (now married to Hamlet's mother, Gertud) that killed his father, Claudius's own brother. Soon Hamlet is completely absorbed in a revenge plot, with nothing- not even ambivalent love Ofelia- stopping him in his path. This is a simplified explanation of what is often complex- psychologically, emotionally, politically- in substance as it is in performance, but Hamlet is such a dense work that you could watch it 10 times and not really soak in everything that's being spoken and reflected. There's poetry in the language, so much so that you'll occasionally need a decoder to decipher some of the turns of phrase (aside from those that have entered our language-lexicon), and bits of philosophy, from the obvious ""To be or not to be"" scene to Hamlet (also classically) reflecting on the court jester, holding his skull by an open grave.Keep this in mind - Branaugh's film is long, and there's even an intermission (likely where one was in the stage version). But first and foremost on Branaugh's mind as a director is to translate many scenes that could be too stagey with an eye for inter-cutting, suggesting and supplanting sights and visions during a scene of dialog (one of the ones he keeps going back to is Hamlet and Ofelia making love in bed) and for a limitless movement of the camera. His style is slick but not too slick, stylish but only to serve a scene that requires elegance or tension or darkness or anxiety, and on the level of pure atmosphere there's rarely a note or scene that's missing the proper theatricality or grandiosity necessary. It's no less epic than something like David Lean, except that there are a few more scenes of people sitting in rooms talking/yelling to/at one another.As Branaugh shows how good a director he can be on the front of the technical, with his actors it's just as amazing. Even actors like Billy Crystal and Robin Williams dig into their brief roles after what could have been simply goof bit parts. Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, and Branaugh himself are about the best outside of an Olivier-headed cast, and in some cases even greater; Winslet especially gives the goods on what is a follow-up breakthrough performance after Heavenly Creatures as Ofelia. And least to forget smaller players like Charlton Heston, who bursts onto the screen so vividly in just two scenes that it marks as a real performance, not just a walk-on, and perhaps his last monumental performance at that. Meanwhile, Branaugh himself in the titular role is just about everything one would want in a screen Hamlet: forceful, resonant, strong, and with some level of dark wit needed for a brooding character.Branaugh's Hamlet is handsome work with a disturbing edge to a lot of its scenes, and it's one of the definitive portrayals of Shakespeare, old or new.",Hamlet
10,dbborroughs,Wildly uneven but worth seeing,7,15 February 2004,"Despite what you've heard the all star cast is not as distracting as the fact the film swings wildly from one of the worst Shakespeare adaptations to one of the best films ever made on a scene by scene basis. I saw this in the theater originally and had to leave 90 minutes in because of its ping pong nature was too much to endure at late show that was due to end close to 2am.
I've since watched it several times on tape and TV and think its one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. The film contains several actors best performances, Charlton Heston leaps instantly to mind. If you want to see and understand Hamlet see this version, but be warned there are some truly awful moments in it.",Hamlet
11,anaconda-40658,A Great Update.,9,21 April 2016,"Hamlet (1996): Dir: Kenneth Branaugh / Cast: Kenneth Branaugh, Charlton Heston, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Billy Crystal: Remarkable film featuring stunning art direction. Kenneth Branaugh does an excellent job as director but he also takes to the screen portraying Hamlet himself. He previously directed Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Much to Do About Nothing but this film features a most impressive art direction. The film is filled with splendid supporting roles including Charlton Heston in scene stealing comic moments. As we know from the play, Hamlet's father was poisoned by his brother and his ghostly figure appears to him. Hamlet wants revenge but unable to take action but unsettles others in despair. Ultimately a revenge does not suffice in a duel to the death. Julie Christie is set to marry the villain. Kate Winslet is strong as Hamlet's romantic interest. Billy Crystal is cast in the small but famous role as grave digger who throws off his thoughts and advice with a touch of humour. The film will appeal to those who have studied the Shakespearian play but its remarkable production is a delight to the eye and will appeal to a broader audience. It also arrives the same year as the updated version of Romeo and Juliet. That film was aimed as a modern update that never reaches the heights that Branaugh so gorgeously applies so artistically to this update. Score: 9 / 10",Hamlet
12,HotToastyRag,Kenneth Branagh shines,7,15 June 2019,"When you rent the 1996 version of Hamlet, be prepared for a long evening. You'll get an intermission, and you'll need it, because the running time is four and a half hours. This is one of the longest movies ever made!Adapted, directed, and starring Kenneth Branagh, you'll be treated to his finest performance as he puts every part of himself into the role. Even if Hamlet isn't your favorite of Shakespeare's works, you'll be able to recognize his incredible talent. There are others among the cast who deliver their Shakespearean monologues in the typical theatrical way-meaning it was in a foreign language and I couldn't understand a word they were saying-but Kenneth Branagh does what very few have been able to do: make Shakespeare seem like English. If you're going to tune out and get more popcorn, do it during someone else's scene.Among the supporting players, Derek Jacobi plays Hamlet's uncle, Julie Christie plays Gertrude, and Kate Winslet plays Ophelia. While it makes much more sense in the story for Ophelia and Hamlet to have a physical relationship, not every version chooses to show that. In this version, there is a sex scene or two, shown in flashback; many flashbacks are used during dry monologues to show the audience what's going on, and it's a neat way to breathe a little more life into the stage play. Kate still seems enormously green as an actress, coming off her early role in Sense and Sensibility, so if you're like me and like her mature performances better, you won't like her as Ophelia. It is possible to find a seasoned actress, or at least a quick study or one who can pretend she knows what she's doing, and still be young enough to play Ophelia. They've made a million versions of Hamlet, and not every Ophelia has made the audience cringe. Julie Christie, who came out of retirement to take her role, might also make you cringe as she wears a constant smirk throughout her scenes. I didn't know if she was constantly on the verge of laughing, thought she wasn't in the frame, or had a very strange interpretation of the character. Needless to say, if you're going to sit through four and a half hours, you won't be doing it for the ladies, you'll be doing it for Kenneth Branagh.Keep your eyes open for many recognizable faces, and in his trademark of casting, you'll find many actors who'd never, ever be cast in a Shakespearean play and now get the opportunity to show the audience that they, too, can speak a foreign language. Can you imagine Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, and Gerard Depardieu speaking Shakespeare? Now you can hear it! The latter has a cameo, with most of his lines consisting of ""Yes, milord,"" but it's very cute. Back in 1989, Gerard dubbed Kenneth Branagh's lines in the French version of Henry V and widely promoted the movie overseas, and as a thank you, he was included in Hamlet. You'll also find Charlton Heston, Rufus Sewell, Nicholas Farrell, Rosemary Harris, Michael Maloney, Ken Dodd, Richard Briers, Reece Dinsdale, Richard Attenborough, and if you blink, you'll miss John Gielgud, Judi Dench, and John Mills making appearances.It's impossible to talk about this version of Hamlet without mentioning the visuals, which were nominated at the Oscars for Art Direction and Costumes, but passed over in favor of The English Patient. If you ever get bored, you can stare at the details in the costumes or sets and be perfectly entertained. In Hamlet's library, the shelves are full of books stacked in different directions, knick-knacks crowding the shelves, and pictures lining the walls. The main hall is covered in a stunning patterned floor, adorned with beautiful furniture, and crowned by a staircase that frames the shots very nicely. The setting was adapted to the late 1800s, and Alexandra Byrne's costumes are rich and beautiful.Every Shakespeare has its highs and lows, and even though I'm heaping praise on this version, there are some boring bits. After all, the screenplay didn't cut any of the original text! The highlights are the visuals, a wonderful performance by Charlton Heston, and Kenneth Branagh's emotional outbursts. The ""get thee to a nunnery"" scene is very touching, and it's inventively filmed in a room of mirrors. Weigh the pros and cons to help you decide which version you want to rent.",Hamlet
13,Sylviastel,A Classic Film!,10,11 December 2005,"William Shakespeare would be proud of Kenneth Branagh's work in this film adaptation. Granted the uncut version is long and tedious but it is visually stunning and extremely well directed by the star as well. Maybe KEnneth Branagh is not only Laurence Olivier but our Orson Welles of this generation. They spared no expense in casting the finest actors around for pivotal roles. Sir Derek Jacobi was casted as King Claudius and Julie Christie was casted as Queen Gertrude. I guess Judi Dench was busy. Kate Winslet was casted as Ophelia. I'm sorry but I never did care for her in this role or in any other role. Besides Derek Jacobi who is also Kenneth Branagh's mentor. He casted Richard Briers (The Good Life or Good Neighbors) as Polonius or Ophelia's father. He does a fabulous take on the supporting role. Besides Briers is often casted in Branagh's films and if you knew him, you would see why. He is one of the most popular chaps in this business. The costumes are colorful. The scenery is also magnificent as well as the art direction. I am sad that Kenneth Branagh did not get an Academy Award nomination for this role. It's one of the best film versions to date. His only weakness is that he does not appear to go mad enough like Nicol Williamson in an earlier version who was really going mad. I liked the fact that he casted American legend, Jack Lemmon, in a small role. Also American legendary actor, Charlton Heston is also unforgettable in this film as Fortinbras. And Robin Williams in a small role. It is nice that he chooses talented American actors like Jack, Charlton and Robin to play roles. He could have chose anybody else. It's probably one of Charlton's last grat performances since he is suffering from Alzheimers. If you can, please watch and treasure this film classic.",Hamlet
14,JamesHitchcock,Perhaps the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare tragedy,10,17 October 2008,"This was the second of two filmed ""Hamlets"" in the nineties, the first being Franco Zeffirelli's, starring Mel Gibson, from 1990. Zeffirelli's version, like Laurence Olivier's from 1948, was based upon an abridged version of the play, with much of Shakespeare's original text being cut. (I have never seen Tony Richardson's 1969 version, but as that ran to less than two hours, shorter even than Zeffirelli's, I presume that was also abridged). Kenneth Branagh was attempting something much more ambitious- a film based on the complete text of the play, with a running time of around four hours.With his ""Henry V"", Branagh claimed Olivier's crown as the cinema's leading Shakespearean, confirming his claim with his brilliant ""Much Ado about Nothing"", a rare example of a great film based on a Shakespeare comedy. ""Hamlet"" was his third Shakespeare film as director (he also acted as Iago in Oliver Parker's 1995 ""Othello"") and, as one might expect, it is very different to ""Much Ado."". The earlier film, shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside, is a joyous, summertime film about everything that makes life worth living.""Hamlet"", by contrast is set in the depths of winter. (The flowers in the description of Ophelia's death suggest that Shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer). The look of the film is particularly striking, both sumptuous and chilly. It was filmed at Blenheim Palace, possibly England's most grandiose stately home, but also a rather forbidding one. The snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry; the interior ones formal and elaborate. The action is updated to the mid nineteenth century; the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era, while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms. (There is a contrast here with Zeffirelli's film, where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone). The play is dominated by images of corruption and decay; Branagh's intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying ""something rotten in the state of Denmark"".The film is notable for the large number of big-name actors, some of them in very minor roles. (Blink, and you might miss John Gieldgud or Judi Dench). Apparently, an all-star cast was required by the production company, who were nervous about a four-hour film. Some of the imported Hollywood stars, such as Robin Williams' Osric, did not really come off, but others, like Charlton Heston's Player King or Billy Crystal's First Gravedigger, played their parts very well. Yorick, normally only seen as a skull, is here seen in flashback, played by the British comedian Ken Dodd. Brian Blessed, who often plays jovial characters, is cast against type as the Ghost, and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening.Of the major characters, perhaps the weakest was Kate Winslet's Ophelia. Branagh's leading lady in his first two Shakespeare films was his then wife Emma Thompson, but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995. I did, however, find myself wishing that Thompson had been cast in the role; although Winslet came into her own in the Ophelia's mad scenes, she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane. (I preferred Helena Bonham Carter in Zeffirelli's version). Richard Briers plays Polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given, a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool. Julie Christie also brings dignity to the role of Gertrude; there is no attempt here, as there was with Gibson and Glenn Close in the Zeffirelli version, to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and Hamlet. (An interpretation which owes more to Freud than it does to Shakespeare). The age difference between Christie and Branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son, which was certainly not the case with Close and Gibson. (Olivier's Gertrude, Eileen Herlie, was, bizarrely, thirteen years younger than him).Branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to ""reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy."" Much stress is placed upon the war with Norway and the Norwegian Prince Fortinbras- a subplot ignored altogether by Zeffirelli. This emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of Claudius, sometimes played as a one-dimensional villain. There is something about Derek Jacobi's performance which suggests that Claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances, but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust. He could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother, but chose to rule as a bad king. Although he is tormented by guilt, he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done.Branagh, a wonderfully fluent speaker of Shakespeare's verse, is superb in the main role. Like Gibson, he has little time for the old concept of Hamlet as indecisive, passive and melancholy. His is an active, physical, energetic Hamlet, something best shown in his fatal duel with Laertes. His guiding principle is not world-weary despair, but an active disgust with evil and corruption.It was a gamble for Branagh to make a four-hour epic, and the film did not do well at the box office. It was, however, praised by many critics, James Berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic. My own opinion is that, whatever the financial returns may have been, Branagh's gamble paid off in artistic terms. By concentrating on the full text, he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of Shakespeare's most complex play. When I reviewed his ""Much Ado"", I said it was the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare comedy. His ""Hamlet"" may just be the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare tragedy. 10/10",Hamlet
15,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Hamlet (1996) 8.1/10,8,13 November 2021,"""Branagh inexorably reigns over, his interpretation of Hamlet is categorically riveting from stem to stern, he also imbues stimulatingly mordant irony into those trenchantly uttered words, which engenders a ghost of naivety, puzzlement, or dread among his spate of erudition, the wording is archaic, but Hamlet's complexity becomes chiseled and relatable to even those who are not anglophone. Also, Branagh's assertiveness is rather enchanting to behold, unlike Sir Olivier, on top of the astounding dithyrambs uttered in a rich baritone with a vengeance, he also waltz with facility, ergo, the entire film feels fleet-footed albeit its hefty length (still, an intermission is highly commended).""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Hamlet
16,paul2001sw-1,Enduring greatness,8,11 January 2003,"Any reaccquaintence with Shakespeare immediately reminds you of the reason for his greatness: the wonderful language, poetic, subtle and (even for the most ignorant of modern audiences) incredibly familiar - I lost count of the number of times I was made to think 'so Shakespeare said that!'.  In Hamlet, he recycles many of the devices that characterise his work: political intrigue; pompous, stupid officialdom; mockery of bad acting; moments of bawdiness; mistaken identity; overheard conversations; plus several flavours of insanity.  Chief among these is Hamlet's own mood, somewhere between madness, obsession and depression.  This is a story of stunning ambition.Of course, what is even more remarkable is that the texts are only the basis for a 'performance art', originally the theatre but now also cinema.  In any great stage adaptation, the deployment of the script is as important as the raw material.  This can create a problem for film directors, who are freed from the necessary narrative constraints on theatrical performances but who lack their immediacy in exchange.  But Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet stands as proof that it is possible to use the Bard's tales within a wholly cinematic edifice.Ken Branagh's Hamlet is a more conventional adaptation than that, basically a filmed version of the play.  In the few places where he takes advantage of the freedom derived from the fact he is making a film, the effects are unimaginative and proscriptive, with superfluous flashbacks and poor special effects.  Branagh's performance in the difficult title role is also hard to warm to: his Hamlet is self-righteous, sanctimonious and even somewhat camp. In conveying his madness and brilliance through verbal dexterity, Hamlet is almost like a prototype for David Thewlis' Johnny in Mike Leigh's Naked; but in this version, without the latter's menace and depth.Sympathy is therefore drawn to Hamlet's antagonist Claudius.  Derek Jacobi plays him with real humanity, a fully three-dimensional villain.  Also excellent are an unusually expressive Julie Christie, and Michael Maloney.Viewed purely as a piece of cinematography, this is not a stunning film; but it should be viewed as a brave attempt to bring a great, complex and (very) long play to the modern audience. It grows as it endures.",Hamlet
17,ericstevenson,My longest movie ever!,10,16 August 2017,"I am very satisfied to say that this is now the longest movie I have ever seen in my entire life and it was certainly worth it! When you have a film this long, you simply know you're going to have it give it a full score or it'll just become annoying. Films that are so long are able to grab our attention for a long time and never run out of steam. This is why films like ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Gone With The Wind"" are so good. It's the first movie I've seen over four hours long. The story of Hamlet is in fact updated, but it's not quite into modern times. It's actually in the latter part of the 19th Century.It's arguably the most faithful adaptation ever, seeing as how they worked very hard to get everything from the play in such a long film. It was great to be re-introduced to these classic characters again. It was especially refreshing to look at Rosencrantz and Guildenstern whom I barely remember from the original story. This certainly suited them better than the actual movie with them, not that I don't enjoy that film as well. I will admit that it probably is in fact a little too long, but it's definitely worth it. I've seen relatively few Shakespeare movies made in recent years.Considering it's some of the earliest stuff to be adapted, that's quite surprising. It was around the 1996 to 2001 time that a lot of bad movies and shows were being made, probably because we didn't know how to react to the Internet. This film is a true gem because it's one of the best films to come out of those years making it all the more special. I probably don't like it quite as much as a few other versions, but it's definitely one of the best. Just when you think the most famous actors have been introduced, Robin Williams comes in! Seriously, I think he might be the main reason I give this a perfect score. ****",Hamlet
18,sol-,My brief review of the film,9,11 January 2005,"A visually very interesting version of the famous Shakespearean play, thanks to a splendid set design and cinematography that gives the story magnificent flow. As the first version of the play to be filmed in its entirety, it is quite long and rather heavy going at times, but all this is sort of justified by the filmmakers' attempt to capture the whole play, even though it is a hefty price to pay, as the film cannot be endured in one straight go. But this is the only strikingly flaw in Branagh's take of the play. Overall, it is a magnificent production, with a fine ensemble cast, which includes in small supporting roles, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Timothy Spall, Charlton Heston, Judi Dench, John Gielgud, Billy Crystal and others.",Hamlet
19,Thanos_Alfie,The Prince...,5,10 June 2020,"""Hamlet"" is a Drama movie in which we watch Hamlet who is the Prince of Denmark finding out something about the death of his father that will change not only he way of thinking but also his life for ever.I enjoyed this movie because of its very good and interesting plot, and the interpretations of the cast. The direction which was made by Kenneth Branagh was very good and it was obvious in the whole duration of the movie how well he studied William Shakespeare's play. I also liked the interpretations of both Kenneth Branagh who played as Hamlet and Julie Christie who played as Gertrude since they were both simply amazing. Finally, I have to say that even if you have already watched the ""Hamlet"" movie of 1990 and you liked it then you should definitely have to watch this movie too.",Hamlet
20,Red-125,Branagh's Hamlet,7,2 March 2014,"Hamlet (1996) stars Kenneth Branagh, who directed himself in the title role. There is quite a bit to like in this Hamlet, but also quite a bit not to like.On the positive side, Branagh is a trained Shakespearean actor, and he is excellent in the role. (Of course, at age 36, he was too old for the part. However, he manages to carry it off.)Julie Christie makes a fine Gertrude. I wasn't impressed by Kate Winslet's Ophelia. At 21, her age was OK, but I just couldn't accept her as the innocent young woman who is forced into madness by the tragic events that surround her. (Apparently, Branagh didn't accept her innocence either. He kept cutting to scenes of Hamlet and Ophelia writhing in passion on a bed. Not implied in Shakespeare's text, in my opinion.)I definitely didn't accept Ophelia's mad scenes. (If you want to see the definitive Ophelia, watch Helena Bonham Carter in Mel Gibson's Hamlet.)Another real plus for Branagh's Hamlet is that he used every word of Shakespeare's text. The standard version of the movie lasts for four hours. (There's an intermission built in.) That's courageous, and saves the endless questions about ""What did the director choose to cut?"" On the negative side, Branagh has set the drama in Victorian times. Why? I can see a medieval Hamlet, a Renaissance Hamlet, a modern Hamlet, But not a 19th Century Hamlet. Here we have Victorian soldiers holding medieval pikes as their weapons. (OK for tourists to see in the Tower of London, but not in Victorian-era Denmark.)Branagh went on location to Blenheim Castle for the exterior scenes, but used a sound stage for the interiors. This let him set up a mirror-lined hall, which he utilized effectively. (Also, a convenient padded cell for Ophelia, which was ridiculous.)My biggest complaint about this production was that Branagh stayed with Shakespeare almost to the end, but then he gave up and turned the film into ""Die Hard Elsinore."" During the critical dueling scene, when all the truths are being revealed, the Norwegian army, led by Fortinbras, storms the castle, crashing through windows, slitting the throats of sentries, etc. This invasion isn't called for in Shakespeare's text, and it undercuts the drama of the duel scene. This criticism may only find acceptance with older viewers. I'm auditing an undergraduate honors course entitled ""Shakespeare on Film."" The students, who are very sophisticated about both Shakespeare and film, disagreed with me. They thought Bruce Willis (well, Fortinbras) added some much-needed excitement at the end of this very long movie. Obviously, Branagh agreed with them.This version of Hamlet is a must for anyone interested in movies and Shakespeare. We saw it on a large screen (well, a classroom-sized large screen.) It's probably better on a truly large screen, but it's definitely worth seeing in any format. Watch it and make your own decisions about what Branagh did right and and what he did wrong!",Hamlet
21,filipemanuelneto,"Visually beautiful, unbearably long, with tiring dialogues and monologues.",3,4 September 2017,"Bringing Shakespeare to the movies is always a challenge for any filmmaker. I've said it here a few times and I'll always repeat it. There are, however, people who cannot tolerate that: for them, Shakespeare's place is in the stage, never in cinema or television! Why? Because cinema and television needs to cut and adapt the original text in order to make a script, and these simple act is like a crime for those people. These people are simply not able to get out of this mental block and see that the enormous potential of this English author does not cling to the stage or the original words he wrote. Perhaps that's why Kenneth Branagh (a self-confessed fan of the English bard) was so unable to adapt ""Hamlet"". Theater and cinema are not the same thing and its really necessary to adapt dialogues and texts. This is part of the cinema's work whenever you write a script adapted from a book that already exists. It's not negotiable, nor when it is Shakespeare that is concerned! Get used to the idea, purists! Yes, this movie is not exactly a movie. Its a hybrid between cinema and theater, in that it has preserved Shakespeare's original text, and this brutal dissonance between the spoken text and everything else displeased me greatly. I really like Skakespeare's works, he's one of my favorite English-language authors, but I'm not stupid enough to think a movie would look great with four hours of dialogues and monologues in archaic English! It's absurd! If I wanted the original text I would read the book (I have it, and in bilingual Portuguese and English) or I would buy a ticket for the play. In movies, I want a movie, damn it! I know many people will radically disagree with my criticism, but I'm not writing to please anyone so please disagree, I don't care.The cast of the film did a good job, but it's Kenneth Branagh who, for more than one reason, positively stands out. He knew how to give life to the troubled and complex heir of the Danish crown. There are a few more famous names in the cast (the late Richard Attenborough, for example) who have made a good work here, but some others like Robin Williams look as out of place as a Picasso in a chicken coop. Most of the others actors, to me, are illustrious strangers. On a visual level, the film is great: the scenery and clothes were exquisite and soundtrack is also good. However, these positive attributes (which no one can deny) don't make this film good. It's excessive lenght, associated with the original dialogues and monologues, incompatible with the cinema, make everything unbearable and annoying.",Hamlet
22,Rectangular_businessman,The best version,10,10 July 2010,"This has to be the best version ever made inspired in one of the greatest plays ever written ""Hamlet"" from William Shakespeare. Everything from this is perfect: The script, the performances (Specially Kenneth Branagh, which makes a memorable role as Hamlet) the production design and the music. Kenneth Branagh gives this to his version from ""Hamlet"" the greatness that it deserves, portraying the story from an epic perspective. I absolutely loved it. If you love Shakespeare, but specially, if you love great films, you shouldn't miss this one. It must be the best adaptation to a Shakespeare play into a movie. I highly recommend it.",Hamlet
23,howard.schumann,"Despite moments of brilliance, it remains a performance",8,7 March 2010,"The 1980 BBC Time-Life version of Hamlet stars Derek Jacobi as the sweet prince and the 1996 version is directed by Kenneth Branagh who plays the main character. Both versions have their strong points but fail to fully satisfy. Branagh is the only director who delivers a performance of the complete text and the film runs almost four hours. Set in the 19th century, the all-star cast includes Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Richard Briers as Polonius, Julie Christie as Gertrude, and cameo roles by John Gielgud, Billy Crystal, Gerard Depardieu, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams, and Judi Dench.The overall Branagh production is strong and far superior to the BBC Tome-Life version. It is bold, imaginative, engaging, entertaining, and easily accessible, yet full of showmanship that undermines the class of Shakespeare. To say that it is often over-the-top would not be far off the mark, especially in its use of flashbacks to resolve ambiguities in the script. Branagh, though robust and full of energy, seems too old for the role of a university student, a tanned, bleach blonde figure who looks more like one of the Beach Boys than the Prince of Denmark.Despite moments of brilliance, it remains a performance, an actor playing Hamlet rather than being Hamlet himself. He is too commanding a figure, too extroverted, and too firmly resolved to capture Hamlet's essential brooding nature, and his ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy contemplating suicide seems sudden and unmotivated. Likewise, Jacobi's performance does not quite hit the mark though he is more Hamlet than Branagh. Unfortunately, he lacks nobility or elegance, looking more like John Denver in tights than a 16th century prince.Hamlet is normally considered to be dated as being around 1600 since it was first entered in the Stationers' Register in 1602. The statement in the frontispiece, however, alludes to the fact that the play had been widely performed before the first publication and, as early as 1589, over a decade before the conventional dating, Thomas Nashe referred to an ""English Seneca"" who wrote ""whole Hamlets"", and in 1596 Thomas Lodge made another allusion to Hamlet, so the exact date of composition remains a mystery with scholars having to conjure up an ""Ur-Hamlet"" to resolve the discrepancy. Conventional scholarship cannot conceive of the fact that William Shakespeare of Stratford could have written such a mature play before 1990 when he was 26.The author drew on the Norse legend of Amleth first written down by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century and translated into French by Francois Belleforest in 1576. Copies of both Saxo Grammaticus (in Latin) and Belleforest (in French) were in the library of Lord Burghley, de Vere's father-in-law. The story is vastly different, however, from Shakespeare's version.Hamlet's character has been debated for generations and is still not fully understood. It is to Shakespeare's credit, however, that he invented in Hamlet the most complex dramatic character in all of literature, long before the concept of psychology had even been invented. Hamlet is a mass of contradictions. He rails against King Claudius as a drunken fool though no evidence is shown in the play to that effect. Using Ophelia to perpetuate his charade of insanity, he cruelly berates the young innocent girl seemingly without cause, driving her to insanity and death. He shows no remorse over killing Polonius or Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and is so cynical is his contempt for his uncle that he loses all his faith in humanity.On the other hand, he shows a tremendous amount of courage in following his father's ghost in Act 1 and in staging the play ""The Mousetrap"" designed to unravel the King. He engages in lofty and introspective soliloquies about death but they clash with his self-pitying adolescent demeanor. Hamlet's fatal flaw is normally seen as being indecision. On closer scrutiny, however, Hamlet feels more like a revenge tragedy, an example how revenge destroys both the innocent as well as the guilty. Hamlet's mistake is not in indecisively engaging in endless introspection but in too willingly following the demands of his father's ghost, an apparition just as likely to be a playful spirit, a so-called ""hungry ghost"", as the true embodiment of his father's soul.Although Hamlet is changed when he returns from exile and realizes that it is his destiny to kill Claudius, he doesn't quite fully grasp that revenge will never solve his problem, only add to it as the conclusion depicts. Perhaps Hamlet's character might be more appreciated when it is seen as mirroring the resentment of a young Earl of Oxford who became a ward of the court at age 12 after his father died suddenly and his mother quickly remarried, with both mother and stepfather dying in a few years. Forced to marry Lord Burghley's daughter Anne Cecil who was 14 years old at the time, Oxford bore his resentment against Anne for most of his life, believing her to be unfaithful and abandoning the marriage after he returned from Italy in 1576 when he was still only 25 years old. This, however, only scratches the surface.As Hank Whittemore describes, ""Oxford had been stopped by pirates in the Channel and had talked his way out of a jam pretty much the same way Hamlet did; Oxford brought plays to Court the way Hamlet did; Oxford had married chief minister Burghley's daughter, reflecting Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia, daughter of chief minister Polonius; Horatio is Hamlet's great friend; Horatio Vere was Oxford's famous military cousin; Horatio and Francisco are on watch in the play; Horatio and his brother Francis were ""the fighting Veres"" and Oxford's close cousins."" Nothing of the Polonius-Ophelia-Laertes subplot can be found in any of Shakespeare's known source material. Maybe if the correct playwright is identified, Hamlet's mixture of adolescent sarcasm and cruelty, bravery and recklessness, deep humanity, flights of poetic fancy, and problems with female sexuality might be better understood.",Hamlet

25,Coxer99,Hamlet,8,5 September 1999,"Glorious adaptation of the finest play ever written with Branagh taking the helm once again as director and star of this massive four hour epic about lies, deception and treachery in Denmark. Splendid cinematography and a stand out performance by the great Jacobi as Claudius are the most striking elements of the film. But...Branagh's casting of familiar Hollywood faces forces me to coin this film as ""The Who's Who of Hollywood Stars Cast in Shakespeare...Who Can't Do Shakespeare!"" Obviously, the example that has been most pointed out is Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. First of all, he's not that horrible. Yes, he is not a Shakespearean actor and vocally, he struggled with the content of the text, but the physical presence of the Jack Lemmon that has been in motion pictures for four decades is there and I can see Branagh's reasons for the casting decision. For die hard fans of the play, natrually they hate Lemmon's performance...although he's out of there after the first twenty minutes. My advice, if you dislike it that much...fastforward...but trust me, I've seen worse. (Check out the 1970 film version of ""Julius Caesar,"" with Charlton Heston, who incidentially has a small role as the Player King in Branagh's film.)",Hamlet
26,MissSimonetta,The definitive Dane,9,2 April 2015,"No doubt some would criticize Branagh's mammoth production of Hamlet for being over the top, but for me, it's a miracle the play could be adapted to film completely, especially with this many stars and such a large budget. It's a beautiful throwback to the mega-epics of the 1960s, the best of them like Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago.While Olivier and Zeffirelli went for moody black-and-white and gloomy subdued color palates, Branagh paints the screen with luscious colors, giving us an opulent Elsinore court, heightening the sense of the political, moral, and sexual corruption therein. The entire cast is exceptional, but the highlight is certainly Branagh as Hamlet. He gives a truly multifaceted performance.God, it's hard to really analyze it right now; I'm still stunned. Though there will no doubt be great cinematic Hamlets to come, Branagh's going to be a hard one to top.",Hamlet
27,gcd70,"Purposeful, impacting film is an epic and a half",7,3 June 2009,"Grand epic as it is, Kenneth Branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power. Two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. While I absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such, I must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance, his rhetoric (and he sends himself up so well) and his many flourishes. Thus ""Hamlet"" loses its impact as it loses its grip.From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's cinematography to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets, the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights, which compliments a fine cast. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels, adapting, directing and playing. His adaptation is superb, his direction strong, but by the time he got to the role of Hamlet, the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role. Derek Jacobi gobbles up the sinister Claudius with glee, and Julie Christie is most dramatic as his queen, Gertrude. Richard Briers is marvellous as Polonius, and Charlton Heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player King. Many others drop by, including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years, Kate Winslet. Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, Ophelia.To finish (before this review goes on longer than the film), I must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie. Branagh has directed with purpose, giving many important, impacting scenes. Too many of them outstay their welcome. Watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. ""Neither a lender nor a borrower be"" or ""Be true to thyself"". And of course: ""To be or not to be"".The opening two hours does take some perseverance, but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward.Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon",Hamlet
28,Spleen,On the four-hour version ...,8,23 February 2000,"... I mean, why bother watching the shorter one?It's a spectacular achievement, and if I concentrate too much on the several ways in which it falls a bit short, I hope you'll forgive me.Branagh (or someone working for him - I really should look this up) isn't sufficiently credited for the visual style of his films.  Everyone rabbits on about how great Coppola's `Dracula' looks, for instance; yet one hears very little about `Frankenstein', which makes `Dracula' look like the hideous, cheesy patchwork quilt that it is.  A similar injustice is done to `Much Ado About Nothing' and `In the Bleak Midwinter'.  `Hamlet', too, offers absorbing views well worth staring at (and that didn't cost nearly as much as they look as though they did).  The `get the to a nunnery' scene, in a hall of mirrors, is technically dazzling.  I gather it was a nightmare to shoot.But every so often the sure touch fails.  The scene in which Hamlet meets the ghost of his father is risible, unworthy of the big screen, certainly unworthy of most of the rest of the film.  And as much as I enjoyed the art direction at the time I now wonder about the basic idea.  `Hamlet' has been re-set in the nineteenth century.  Instead of a grim stone castle we have a glittering palace out of Hans Christian Andersen - the advantage being that the throne of Denmark now looks like something worth fighting for.  But surely the same effect could have been achieved without altering the setting?  When Branagh made `Much Ado About Nothing', for instance, he did not explicitly deny Shakespeare's setting; he simply resorted to fantasy whenever he wanted an effect would have been anachronistic had the setting been realistically represented.  Perhaps Branagh thought that too much fantasy is unbecoming a drama.  If so, he was wrong.Also, although Branagh's `nothing but the best for Shakespeare's finest play' approach results in something truly special and captivating (I can't stress this enough), I can't help but find the film a little soulless. Having found nothing but the best Branagh doesn't seem to know quite what to do with it.  This may well be the definitive version of `Hamlet', but I was hoping, paradoxically, for something better than a definitive version.Still, why complain?  It's a treat.  To get the most out of this spectacular work you should: (1) Watch the four hour version.  (2) Watch it in a cinema. (3) Try to find one of those rare audiences that isn't scattered with people who insist on reciting the lines before the characters do, presumably to prove that they're familiar with the play.  I hate it when they do that.",Hamlet
29,Movie-ManDan,Can't Give This a Perfect Score,5,27 June 2014,"Kenneth Branagh is one of the best actors on God's Green Earth. Hamlet is the best character of all time in William Shakespeare's best play. Put them together and you are sure to find great glory. This movie is nearly flawless. The set is magnificent, the casting is superb and this is the only Hamlet done in its entirety: something rare.The story of Hamlet is about the Hamlet, Prince of Denmark who is angry and depressed that the recent death of his father is being ignored, especially by his uncle: the current king who has married his mother. Hamlet is soon visited by a ghost that claims to be Hamlet's father, and says the king poisoned him and wishes for Hamlet to seek revenge. Hamlet's deadly plan soon turns into a complex issue that will cost many people their lives and nearly destroy the state of Denmark.Despite a star-studded cast, some of it did not work. Jack Lemmon is an all-time great, that does not do a good job as Marcellus. Despite this being the full play, word-for-word, some parts could easily be cut for time and boredom. I wasn't bored, but some people could be. Despite the sets being elaborate, they were, in some cases, distracting. Despite these flaws, I personally didn't think they were bad. Enough nit-picking on these, the main flaw I found was Kenneth Branagh. Branagh picked up where Laurence Olivier left off. But Branagh surpasses Olivier on screen as Olivier preferred the stage. I thought that Kenneth Branagh outdid Olivier in his 1989 production of Henry V. Then this comes along and I felt nothing. From somebody who has studied Hamlet and has done thorough research on the play, I was very unhappy Branagh's performance. One of Hamlet's key traits is that he is a likable character. Kenneth Branagh depicts him as a very unlikeable character. He plays him out like a high school student would who is trying to score a high mark in a drama class. Branagh shows him to be an overly angry, temperamental, greedy, chauvinistic, stubborn, mean, nut-case. Overall, very one-dimensional. Hamlet is actually a very philosophical, determined, witty, mysterious, sharp, genius, nervous, depressed-at-times, and angry-at-times. Overall, every human trait is shown through Hamlet many times throughout the play. It is only during the last hour that Hamlet finally becomes good in this. I actually found myself rooting for King Claudius in some parts. That is also bad, the evil King is too nice. I know that Hamlet displays some negativity and Hamlet can be done different ways, but Branagh leans him way too much toward one side for too much of the movie. Hamlet cannot be leaned too much toward one side. Honestly, I think that Branagh tried to make Hamlet an easy character for everybody to understand, for dramatic purposes. Somebody like Kenneth Branagh must know Hamlet's proper portrayal. I listened to when he played Hamlet in the 1992 stage version, and he was fantastic at every angle I could hear. But making him John Bender of The Breakfast Club 2.0 is a total disgrace.2/4",Hamlet
30,JuguAbraham,Inventive interpretation of the play but not the best,8,25 August 2001,"This is definitely an important interpretation of Hamlet on screen. The oratorical skills of Branagh especially when he twists his face to say `Words, words, words..' are magnetic. Of particular note is Branagh's felicity with the use of mirrors, so appropriate for cinema than for theatre, for the famous `to be or not to be' sequence. Shakespeare would have loved this innovation.Initially, I was amused to see Julie Christie traipse around in a most non-queenly manner as if she was reprising her old role of Bethsheba in `Far from the Madding Crowd'. As the film progressed, she evolved into a very credible queen. If this progression was Branagh's intent, full marks to the director.The editing (Neil Farrel) and music (Patrick Doyle) were equally commendable throughout the film. The conversation between Laertes and the priest at the burial is accentuated in this adaptation, which is again a Branagh touch of brilliance. The silent cameo of Sir John Mills (bringing to mind his award winning role in Ryan's Daughter), the performances of Kate Winslett and Derek Jacobi, the short appearances of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, and the rendering of `In Pace' by Placido Domingo were definite highlights of this version. What was out of place? The pulling down of statues is one twist of adaptation that was not called for. Why does Branagh use a different dye for his hair and another for his beard? And the below par performance  of Jack Lemmon? However, my vote for the best version of Hamlet goes to Grigory Kozintsev's 1964 black and white cinemascope version in Russian. If you love to watch Shakespeare's plays as movies-the finest adaptations are those of the late Kozintsev who made `Hamlet' (`Gamlet' in Russian) and `King Lear' (1969). Most versions have English subtitles. The late Lord Laurence Olivier in the book `Shakespeare on Film' applauded these Soviet `Christian-Marxist' interpretations of the plays. Kozintsev's two films had the music of Shostakovich, translation of Pasternak, photography by a great cameraman called Jonas Gritsius and unforgettable performances by fine actors such as Innokenti Smoktunovsky (Hamlet) and Yuri Jarvet (King Lear). Branagh, inventive as he is, would be humbled by Kozintsev, who used black and white and cinemascope or widescreen format for dealing with the dark subject when he could indeed have used color as many directors have resorted to while adapting the play on screen.",Hamlet
31,winner55,Branagh,6,16 July 2006,"The internet has made digging up real information virtually impossible. When it first appeared, I remember that many people believed that all our library books would be scanned onto microchip (and then quietly destroyed as no longer necessary).Well, a lot of them have been destroyed, but unfortunately somebody forgot to scan them first.Hamlet has been a fascinating subject for female actors since the beginning of film itself (Sarah Benhardt is apparently the first to have the play recorded on film). Sometime before the second World War, a female actress in England decided to make a complete film of the (then) accepted authoritative copy of the whole of Shakespeare's play. The film ran some 5 hours.I have searched and searched for information about this woman and her film, and have come up with naught. I mention this at all because Branagh earned a reputation for his version of Hamlet even before the film's release with his promise of the ""complete version of the whole play"" (according to currently accepted authoritative texts).Well, as it turns out, having a complete version of a play doesn't actually mean one has a good performance of it.Branagh clearly wants us to forget the Olivier version - but unfortunately makes all of Olivier's mistakes without any of Olivier's delicious Gothicism (which is really what makes the Olivier play special). So Branagh is loud, ego-centric, pretentious, neurotic - all the worst aspects of Olivier's Hamlet - but never brooding, mysterious, or ethereal - many of Olivier's best qualities. Olivier's Hamlet appears to be visiting from another world - and none too happy about his short stay in Denmark. Branagh's Hamlet is visiting a Kenneth Branagh film festival, and got lost at the wine-and-cheese buffet.Understand that I really admire Branagh's previous Shakespeare efforts, and believe him to be an excellent actor. But Mary Shelley's Frankenstein showed us a side of Branagh - loud and egotistical - that we didn't really need, and then he pours that all into this film - which unfortunately we have to suffer with for four whole hours, if we choose.Will some internet computer wiz please remember not to preserve this film?",Hamlet
32,bandw,Would someone like this who is not a Shakespeare fan?,9,6 February 2007,"Filming an unexpurgated ""Hamlet"" is a risk. Those who love Shakespeare will most likely have some critical observations and those for whom Shakespeare is intimidating will probably not give it a chance. At four hours in length watching this *is* a commitment.A person not well versed in Shakespeare is going to find that a good part of this movie will fly right over his head. All those strange words: gyves, fust, reechy. shent, fellins, romage, clepe, cautel, eale, arabbing, chopine, and so on. And all those insights so elegantly expressed but often requiring more time to understand than you have. I found that reading the play before watching this movie was very helpful and was a rewarding effort, independent of seeing the play performed. You can savor the language and insights at your leisure.In any case there is enough here to engage anybody willing to pay attention. Such a person will get the main drift of the story and should be able to appreciate the opulence of the production. And there is enough cinematic goings on to keep things moving. The sets are stunning. Branagh has made a movie rather than filming a play.Some will find that this ""Hamlet"" pushes the envelope of excess, both in terms of Branagh's robust performance and the adventurous cinematography. I found the many 360 degree pans to be distracting. The final duel is impressively filmed, but Branagh could not seem to restrain himself, having Hamlet swing down to Caludius on a chandelier a la Errol Flynn. But, credit must be given for the novel concepts and pure spectacle of it all. The marriage scene of Claudius and Gertrude is unforgettable. The approach and ultimate invasion of Fortimbras and his army is dazzling and was quite beyond anything I pictured when reading the play. Ophelia's madness is deep - an inserted scene that has her being hosed down in an isolated room is painful to watch. Background scenes that accompany some of the monologues I found to be more disconcerting than helpful, like the scenes with Hecuba and Priam in the recitation of the first player, or shots of the old king of Norway receiving the message from Claudius.In spite of his tendency to overact, Branagh is a captivating presence. Derek Jacoby is a standout as Claudius; Kate Winslet as Ophelia and Julie Christie as Gertrude are fine. The casting of well known actors in cameos is a bit of a mixed bag. John Mills, Judy Dench, and John Gielgud appear to be in the cast simply for name recognition, since they are on screen for less than two minutes total among them. Jack Lemmon proves that he is simply not cut out to be a Shakespearean actor, no matter how minor the part. But Charlton Heston is surprisingly good and his scene with Rosemary Harris is memorable.Many scenes seem rushed, almost purposely so. Maybe Branagh was just trying to keep this thing at four hours. For example when Ophelia asks Hamlet about the prologue to the play within the play, ""Will he tell us what this show meant?"" and Hamlet responds, ""Ay, or any show that you'll show him; be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means,"" I defy anyone to repeat what he says on first viewing. I replayed this four times before I could tell that he was actually saying all the words. There are too many positives here not to give this film a high rating. Any serious production of ""Hamlet"" gives new insights and proves that the play offers an infinitude of interpretations.",Hamlet
33,DeeNine-2,Not to be missed,10,26 February 2003,"Part of the genius of Branagh's interpretation of Hamlet is in the use of the techniques of the cinema to enhance the production. Branagh has not condensed the acts like some mass market soup, as was done in Olivier's 1948 Oscar-winning production, or in, say, Zeffirelli's 1989 Hamlet lite starring Mel Gibson (both excellent, though, within their scope), but has kept every word while directing our understanding so that even those only casually familiar with the play might follow the intent and purpose with discernment. Recall that for Shakespeare--the ultimate actor's playwright who wrote with precious few stage directions--interpretation was left to the direction and the actors, an open invitation that Branagh rightly accepts.The use of flashback scenes of things implied, such as the amorous union of Ophelia and her Lord Hamlet abed, or of a vast expanse of snow darkened with distant soldiers to represent the threat of Fortinbras' army from without, and especially the vivid remembrance in the mind's eye of the new king's dastardly deed of murder most foul, helps us all to more keenly appreciate just what it is that torments Hamlet's soul. I also liked the intense closeups. How they would have bemused and delighted an Elizabethan audience.Branagh's ambitious Hamlet is also one of the most accessible and entertaining, yet without the faintest hint of any dumbing down or abbreviation. A play is to divert, to entertain, to allow us to identify with others who trials and tribulations are so like our own. And so first the playwright seeks to engage his audience, and only then, by happenstance and indirection, to inspire and to inform. Shakespeare did this unconsciously, we might say. He wrote for the popular audience of his time, a broad audience, it should be noted, that included kings and queens as well as knaves and beggars, and he reached them, one and all. We are much removed from those times, and yet, this play, this singular achievement in theatre, still has the power to transcend mere entertainment, to fuse poetry and story, as well as the high and the low, and speak once again to a new audience twenty generations removed.Branagh himself is a wonderful Hamlet, perhaps a bit of a ham at times (as I think was Shakespeare's intent), a prince who is the friend of itinerant players. He also lacks somewhat in statute (as we conceive our great heroes); nonetheless his interpretation of the great prince's torment and his singular obsession to avenge his father's murder speaks strongly to us all. Branagh, more than any other Hamlet, makes us understand the distracted, anguished and tortured prince, and guides us to not only an appreciation of his actions, wild and crazy as they sometimes are, but to an identification and an understanding of why (the eternal query) Hamlet is so long in assuming the name of action. In Branagh's production, this old quibble with Hamlet's character dissolves itself into a dew, and we realize that he was acting strongly, purposely all the while. He had to know the truth without doubt so that he might act in concert with it.I was also very much impressed with Derek Jacobi's Claudius. One recalls that Jacobi played Hamlet in the only other full cinematic production of the play that I know of, produced in 1980 by the BBC with Claire Bloom as Gertrude; and he was an excellent Hamlet, although perhaps like Branagh something less than a massive presence. His Claudius combines second son ambition with a Machiavellian heart, whose words go up but whose thoughts remind below, as is the way of villains everywhere.Kate Winslet is a remarkable Ophelia, lending an unusual strength to the role (strength of character is part of what Kate Winslet brings to any role), but with the poor, sweet girl's vulnerability intact. She does the mad scene with Claudius as well as I have seen it done, and of course her personal charisma and beauty embellish the production.Richard Briers as Polonius, proves that that officious fool is indeed that, and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king. The famous speech he gives to Laertes as his son departs for France, is really ancient wisdom even though it comes from a fool.Julie Christie was a delight as the besmirched and wretched queen. In the bedroom scene with Hamlet she becomes transparent to not only her son, but to us all, and we feel that the camera is reaching into her soul. She is outstanding.The bit players had their time upon the stage and did middling well to very good. I liked Charlton Heston's player king (although I think he and John Gielgud might have switched roles to good effect) and Billy Crystal's gravedigger was finely etched. Only Jack Lemon's Marcellus really disappointed, but I think that was mainly because he was so poorly cast in such a role. Not once was he able to flash the Jack Lemon grin that we have come to know so well.The idea of doing a Shakespearean play with nineteenth century dress in the late twentieth century worked wonderfully well, but I know not why. Perhaps the place and dress are just enough removed from our lives that they are somewhat strange but recognizable in a pleasing way. And perhaps it is just another tribute to the timeless nature of Shakespeare's play.There is so much more to say about this wonderful cinematic production. It is, all things considered, one of the best Hamlets ever done. Perhaps it is the best. See it, by all means, see it for yourself.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

34,pyrocitor,To thine own source material be true,8,3 December 2007,"Out of all of William Shakespeare's most beloved and well known plays, few works have been adapted, either for the stage or, more recently, in cinematic form. The majority of such productions are known for taking significant liberties with the work, mainly in terms of length and editing. And such is the main selling point for director/star Kenneth Branagh's incarnation of the tragic prince of Denmark: the work is presented unabridged and unashamed of it, and as such, is one of the most unquestionably faithful Shakespearian cinematic adaptations as of yet. Considered by many to be the definitive film version of the play, Branagh's Hamlet is by no means a flawless film, but a powerful and faithful enough work to merit a viewing. Branagh's passion and keep grasp on his source material is evident, as is the astute evidence paid to even the most minute details of the sprawling work. To take a four hour long (the sheer length in itself will unquestionably be enough to deter some viewers either from taking in the film or watching it in a single sitting) Shakespearian play and infuse it with enough zest and energy to keep it interesting for a contemporary audience is no small feat indeed, but to his credit, Branagh performs such a task admirably. The film's mostly strong, but somewhat uneven pacing, including some quintessential contextual flashback sequences, intriguing cinematography and Patrick Doyle's rousing (if slightly overdone) musical score are engaging, and benefit the film immensely. The period adaptation, to 1890s civil war era works surprisingly well, considering the many less than favourable attempts to adapt Shakespearian dramas into a contemporary time period, (Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet comes disconcertingly to mind...) and the vibrant and expansive period sets and costumes are visually delightful, adding a sense of epic splendour to the production. However, considering Branagh's considerable talent and directorial attentiveness, it is a shame indeed that the production still feels like it is missing something, or falling tantalisingly short of the emotional depth and breadth one might hope for in one of Shakespeare's more emotional works. A disappointing number of the film's key emotional moments either come across as disappointingly flat or toeing the line of melodramatic hysteria, though for the most part, Branagh keeps the emotional tension to an appropriate simmer. Also, for such a dialogue intensive work, many of the actors' delivery feels overly ""stagey"", frequently drawing the audience out of the emotional intensity of the moment. However, despite such complaints, on the whole the film performs admirably - it is only a slight disappointment that there is a consistent feel of the full (admittably vast) potential not quite being filled. In such a dramatic work as Hamlet, the performances are key, and thankfully, Branagh has played his cards right by assembling a stellar cast to bring his vision to life. As the title character himself, Branagh manages a precisely poised balance between the brooding, flamboyant and lethal aspects of the character. His careful research and preparation show through his deliberately crafted performance (even his forays into the melodramatic tend to infuse the often imbalanced character with a fitting unusual edge) - it would be difficult to imagine an overall more satisfying Hamlet. Kate Winslet is easily one of the film's strongest points, typically powerful, charismatic and tremendously impressive as the harried Ophelia, Hamlet's love interest. Derek Jacobi gives a strong performance as the Machiavellian King Claudius, infusing the role with the necessary depth to make Claudius a troubled and lamenting character rather than a one dimensional antagonist. As Hamlet's troubled mother Gertrude, Julie Christie, years after her initial call to fame, demonstrates her ability to still craft elegant, credible and tremendously powerful performances. Richard Briers makes for an excellent Polonius, but unfortunately Nicholas Farrell and Michael Maloney prove miscast with little charisma and tendencies to overact as Horatio and Laertes respectively. Branagh also makes use of a supporting cast chock full of famous faces to both keep viewers interested and instill intrinsic value into characters that might otherwise be considered inconsequential. Billy Crystal is perfectly cast as the comic relief Gravedigger, and Robin Williams and Jack Lemmon are put to good use in minuscule yet nonetheless amusing roles as Osric and Marcellus. Brian Blessed is a formidable presence as the Ghost of Hamlet's father, and Charlton Heston and Rosemary Harris are endearing in the ""Player"" interlude. Also, unseen in the abridged cut of the production are entertaining cameos from Gerard Dépardieu, Richard Attenborough and Judi Dench.Shakespeare aficionados will have much to appreciate, as Branagh's passion for his source material and distinct directorial touch help carry the film through its regrettable weaker moments and occasional lapses in emotional poignancy and acting. While the staggering running time and period dialogue will doubtlessly prove too daunting for those unaccustomed to the works of Shakespeare, those willing to make the investment will find Branagh's work to be among the most faithful and entertaining film adaptations of the Bard's works. Considering the tremendous ambition of the task, Branagh's film, while by no means perfect, should still be considered nothing less than a laudable success. -8/10",Hamlet
35,sarastro7,A great modern Hamlet,10,7 December 2006,"A lot of people don't think Branagh's Hamlet film is all that good, but I must admit I think it is splendid. Like virtually every production of Shakespeare, it has problems and it has had to make hard choices, not all of which work out. The thing about the ""secret doors everywhere"", for instance, simply doesn't work. That element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to, which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming. This is the biggest problem with this production. And while it's a biggie, I'm also inclined to say that it's the only problem. Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully. All right, so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role. And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced. And he gets too hysterical at times. But that's it. No other complaints. Even with these faults, I think this version is a seminal one, and if it's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be, it's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be. We get the complete text of the longest version of the play, innovatively and expensively brought to the screen, mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with. But in a staging of Shakespeare, it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language. For that, one must delve into the print versions of the plays.All the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic (incl. Jack Lemmon). Julie Christie as Gertrude is surely one of the best ever, and even the American actors are astounding, esp. Charlton Heston as the Player King - who would have thought it?! (A story is going around that Heston once played Hamlet on stage, and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud, ""This is terrible!"", Heston reportedly retorted right from the stage: ""Well, I didn't write this crap!"" Of course it may not be true, but it's a funny story - and if true, a bold and ironic choice for Branagh to include Heston here.) Robin Williams as ""Young Ozric"" is perhaps not young enough for the part, but he makes it a comical one, which is warranted.Overall it is a very well-produced version, with most of the key scenes being, to my mind, supremely memorable. Of course, I watched this movie just as I was becoming interested in Shakespeare (and around the same time as Luhrmann's formidable Romeo+Juliet), and it made a great impression on me, which must account for some of my fondness for it.All things considered, I must pronounce Branagh's Hamlet to be my favorite one, with Derek Jacobi's 1980 BBC version a close second. I probably like Branagh's Shakespeare work more than most, finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer, with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text. In the world of Shakespeare acting, the two brightest luminaries remain Olivier and Branagh, and while Olivier is the superior actor, Branagh brings Shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice, and transforms it into churlish, easy-going, populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity. Branagh, I believe, brings out a truer Shakespeare than the world has yet seen.And so, 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous Hamlet.",Hamlet
36,DarthVoorhees,An ambitious but imperfect adaptation,9,9 October 2010,"'Hamlet' has never looked finer. Bragnagh has brought the most out of Shakespeare's most beloved play. We truly get the complete story brought out in grand scale. The cast is probably the finest a Shakesparean film has ever received. The sets and camera work are epic in every sense of the word. However I feel Bragnagh's 'Hamlet' falls short of truly being a masterpiece. I really truly wonder if 'Hamlet' cries out to be an epic. It is a psychological drama and a character study. At the worst moments of Bragnagh's opus this is forgotten.I really don't know if I consider 'Hamlet' to be the greatest Shakespearean play. In terms of plot it is somewhat anti-climatic. I do however think that Hamlet is the greatest character I've ever read. To read Hamlet is like dissecting the psyche. Shakespeare's monologues and soliloquies in 'Hamlet' are brilliant dissections of the soul. If anything I want 'Hamlet' to be smaller and more intimate for a greater appreciation of this brilliant character and Shakespeare's language. Bragnagh's film sometimes looses sight of this. While I respect Bragnagh's ambition I somewhat don't understand why the epic scope is so necessary. There are brilliant shots of the Mountains, and charges of soldiers but really what have they to do with Hamlet's inner turmoil? The film is at it's best when it is smaller. I was nearly breathless when Hamlet listens to Claudius' confession, or the classic 'To Be Or Not to Be' soliloquy. Those moments are golden but Hamlet's epic duel with Laertes or the over done build up to the production seem muffled.Bragnagh is a fine Hamlet. Oddly though I feel that he doesn't savor the language. There are moments in the film where Bragnagh rushes through the speeches and dialogue as if it were some sort of race. I love Shakespeare and one of the great pleasures of acting in Shakespearean piece is savoring the language. How often will you utter words of such brilliance and poignancy? Taking your time also allows more clarity for the audience.Again, I respect every choice Bragnagh made and applaud him for it. My only question is are these appropriate for 'Hamlet'? I think the film looks wonderful and has tremendously passionate performances. I love the entire ensemble including Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon, and Billy Crystal. I just think that some of the choices don't allow for the greatest understanding and appreciation of Hamlet. On the contrary Bragnagh's Henry V married epics and intimacy perfectly.",Hamlet
37,moviesleuth2,The Bard would be proud,10,7 January 2010,"The image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it's more true than false). This begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed Kenneth Branagh to create a full-length, uncut version of ""Hamlet"" with his complete creative control among other things. Of course, Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see? Could they have, at least in this case, had enough respect for the material and Branagh's vision to create something for only a few people? That is not a question that I can answer. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching ""Hamlet."" Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. However, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before. According to some, Shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion. That being said, I have no doubt that had he been able to see it, the Bard would have been overjoyed with Branagh's production.The film is top-heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts. All play their parts equally well. I would have thought Branagh too old to play the part of Hamlet, and while he still may be, his performance more than makes up for it. Hamlet is a complex part, displaying every emotion from grief to anger, happiness to madness, and everything in between. Branagh nailed it. Derek Jacobi is terrific as the wily Claudius, whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion; his unique voice is perfect for the role. Julie Christie is also very good as Gertrude, Hamlet's caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game.The classical actors are cast in bit parts (Judi Dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they're in it. Surprisingly, no one takes this to heart; everyone gives it their all, and it shows. Special mention has to go to Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are excellent. Robin Williams is a little too silly, but he's not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).Yet, this is undeniably Branagh's show. He adapted one of the most famous plays in history, and in so doing, he took on a whale of a project; it's impressive that he got it done, but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement. What I really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy it. As most people know, Shakespeare is difficult to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand this. ""Hamlet"" is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting.This is a must see for anyone and everyone. It may be four hours long, but it's definitely worth it.",Hamlet
38,SKG-2,Best Hamlet put to film,10,2 April 1999,"When I first read Hamlet, I couldn't help but think of the ending of OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE, where Bette Midler puts down the play because of how indecisive he is, and says, ""Give me Romeo any day.""  Five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not?  Seemed like overkill to me.  But upon further reading, I grew to really appreciate the play.  I've seen the Olivier and Gibson movie versions(and part of the Nicol Williamson version), and all of them take their model from Olivier; the melancholy Dane.  Olivier at least did it without being self-indulgent about it, but Gibson and, from what I saw, Williamson, looked like they went to the ""Look, Ma, I'm acting!  I'm acting!"" school.Now here comes Kenneth Branagh's version, which is breathtaking from start to finish.  It finished #2 on my top ten of 1996(behind THE ENGLISH PATIENT, and ahead of LONE STAR, JERRY MAGUIRE, FARGO, SECRETS & LIES, EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, BIG NIGHT, and LOOKING FOR RICHARD), and it's the best Hamlet, and maybe the best Shakespeare, put to film. Obviously, Branagh's talents as a filmmaker, for making the full-length version, in 70mm print, and not losing our interest for four hours, is great, but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role.  This was my favorite performance of the year by far.  Branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing Hamlet as a normal, regular human being, and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way.  And unlike Olivier, who depended mostly on his voice, Branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that Hamlet goes through, but since he plays him as normal, none of it seems like scenery-chewing.The rest of the cast is top-notch as well.  I didn't even mind Jack Lemmon, though I agree he was the weakest member of the cast.  The most surprising turn came from Charlton Heston; I've always found him stiff as a board, but he's quite commanding as the Player King.  The other big surprise was Billy Crystal; I thought I'd find him all wrong as the 1st Gravedigger, but he was his usual funny self while being in character.  All in all, a glorious film!",Hamlet
39,PyrolyticCarbon,"Fabulous, lavish production with an all-star cast. A feast for BranaghShakespeare fans.",9,10 December 1999,"I'm not going to write a lot, other people have provided fantastic, rich comments on this film, so I'll be brief.Branagh has taken the entire script and transformed it to screen, with a leap forward in time for the setting he's chosen a grander time, which looks less bleak, but soon changes as the story unfolds.The cast is amazing, with quite unexpected actors\actresses popping up, they are nonetheless perfect in their roles. I've seen comments suggesting that Branagh has hammed it up too much, yet I can't see how that can be true in a story of this depth. He's fantastic in this role, and has proved his talents yet again as actor\director\writer.Sit on a comfy pillow and concentrate, watch it widescreen and enjoy the fantastic camera work and brilliant acting.",Hamlet
40,RiffRaffMcKinley,Something Rotten Indeed,1,17 May 2011,"This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating ""Romeo + Juliet."" I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, ""Hamlet"" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day.I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His ""Hamlet"" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in ""Titus,"" and, in theory, even worked in ""Romeo + Juliet."" But all it says here is, ""I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want."" The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless ""cameos"" as ""The Greatest Story Ever Told."" Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.",Hamlet
41,alainenglish,Spectacular if inconsistent production of over-rated Shakespeare play,8,29 March 2008,"As someone who appreciates the work of the English Bard, I admire attempts to stage and film the plays of William Shakespeare and generally I have enjoyed the ones I've seen, especially the BBC productions of the late 1970s/early 1980s. This isn't the first time Hollywood has tackled ""Hamlet"" either, with Mel Gibson and Franco Zeffirelli's effort in 1989. This one, in sheer ambition and flair, is a very entertaining watch despite Branagh's rigid commitment to do the play full-length.I have never been very fond of ""Hamlet"" the play. This is not to denigrate Shakespeare, but there is just something about it that does not appeal to me. It has some great speeches but above all the plot and the characters are a bit of a bore. ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Richard III"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" - THEY are classic Shakespeare plays. ""Hamlet"" is far too dependent on court intrigue and the meandering musings of it's central character at the expense of genuine emotion and as such comes off as a bit flat.The plot centres in on Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (Branagh) who has returned from Wittenburg University to see his father drop dead and his mother Gertrude (Julie Christie) shacking up with his uncle Claudius (Derek Jacobi) who has since assumed the throne of Denmark. His father's Ghost (Brian Blessed) haunts Hamlet's home in Elisnore Castle and lets the grief-stricken young prince know that Claudius killed him, setting Hamlet on a path to revenge...In his DVD introduction to the movie, Branagh states he wanted to make the definitive version of ""Hamlet"" and assembled a high budget, top-class location in Blenheim Palace as well as an all-star cast to do it. Unfortunately he has not done as well he might. He gives his English stage actor friends the biggest roles and the Hollywood actors he has drafted in are given bit-parts.A further inconsistency derives from his giving actors like Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud and Dame Judi Dench throwaway roles only referred to in the original text and their appearances are often less than a minute long. The only place where this arguably works is in the inclusion of comedian Ken Dodd as Yorick, when Hamlet gives his famous speech ""Alas, poor Yorick"" as an ode to his late court jester.Branagh also fails to show two crucial events in the play: Ophelia's suicide by drowning and Hamlet's escape on a pirate ship after having been exiled to England by Claudius. Their absence, combined with the above throwaway parts, gives the film a maddening inconsistency.It's not all bad, however. Derek Jacobi is excellent as the scheming Claudius and brings a suave charm to the role. His demise, as a result of a falling chandelier, is also very well done. Richard Briers is a delightfully restrained Polonius, played not as a gibbering fool but a competent statesman who's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Kate Winslet is fine as Ophelia and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Timothy Spall and Reece Dinsdale) are suitably clueless. Branagh's Hamlet isn't actually too bad, although he could have toned it down in some parts. His wild, stagey energy is a little too comedic in places.Blenheim Place is a superb location, and Branagh gets a lot of mileage out of the snowy surroundings and mountainsides. The concluding set-piece is excellent with Norwegian forces crashing in on Elsinore as the Danish royal court implodes.A sterling effort from the industrious Branagh, but it's not enough to change my opinion of Shakespeare's most over-rated work.",Hamlet
42,Hermit C-2,Branagh triumphant.,10,4 June 1999,"What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized! This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of Shakespeare's play, but Branagh didn't do it just because ""it was there."" His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain.The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well, it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps immensely when you're watching a four-hour movie. Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of 'Hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with 'Henry V.' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. Let's face it, 'Hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before, he or she needs help even if they've read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.There are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney, and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn't, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist.Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie, but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle's score? No doubt I did. I'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet,' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.",Hamlet
43,renegadeviking-271-528568,Hamlet review,9,16 October 2021,"Though, like Olivier's version of Hamlet, by no means a horror movie, this version is nonetheless grounded in the very frightening and lifechanging appearance of a ghost, and then also involves mental illness, so it skirts the border. The haunting of Hamlet by his father's ghost is not, at first, worked out so well, appearing as it does as if a phantom rising or moving out of a statue of the king outside the main gate of the palace (Blenheim Palace). But when Hamlet is carried off with it, he enters into a no man's land where the ground smokes with miasma, quakes open and quivers, nature is permeated with the hoarse call of the ghost, and then from the trees the face and steely eyes appear, making for a terrifying appearance. Afterwards, when an oath to secrecy is to be taken, the woods enclose, the earth quakes again, it is rousing, almost haunted movie within the movie sequence, quite fun, and even chilling. The fact that Hamlet's father appears close up in profile, means that it is the obsessive lattice form of hypnagogy is at play, and Hamlet does seem entirely beside himself for much of the rest of the production. Did I say, the rest? At FOUR HOURS, this is as far as I know the only full unabridged version of the Shakespeare text, and in its interminable rambling nature it at first exhausts you but then after a time begins to enclose upon you like a TV series you love might. In this scale and range you get a sense that in the days of the Elizabethan theater the play was just an omnibus on which to hang comic, tragic, terrifying, action oriented, and military things, all the genres paused for, giving the audience some dietary palate-cleansing interludes, then moving refreshed on. It is by his understanding of this structure that Kenneth Brannagh stages as climactic some speeches, and then slides other speeches into the in media res of other sequences, pacing things according to how he think the curtain went up and down. Thus, while his To Be or Not to Be speech is almost a quiet monologue in front of a mirror, behind which the king and Polonious listen, his speech about battle which ends with the intermission is a rousing action movie send off, which I have not seen in any other version of the play. As it dawns on you, on one level exhausted by listening hard to the elaborate poetry of the diction, after one hour, that seems like more, that three hours await you, you do begin to relax into it, and simply enjoy being wallpapered into the environment of word and film created by the outing. This format also, surprising, for all his words, and there are very many of them, an astonishing part, this version alone of filmed versions allows you a non-Hamletcentric view of the play if you wish. Not only does Derek Jacobi reveal that the king was not side player, but had a full part unto himself, but Julie Christie as Gertrude, at first reticent, also is given time, deep into the proceedings, to open up, and their encounter in the bedroom is a searing scene indeed, better even, I think, than the Olivier version. Still another thrill is that while in other versions Ophelia is a sideshow at edge of Hamlet's consciousness, in this one it is conjectured that she unwisely carried on a full on sexual affair with him, therefore gets herself seriously emotionally hurt, then when the father is killed, and Hamlet rejects her, she goes mad. Played by the then 20 year old Kate Winslet this Ophelia goes mad indeed, in a thrilling performance given all the room it needs to play out its particular tragedy. Indeed, when Laertes, who also, in this version, steps forward as a major character, sees her, and utters a curse, ""heat, dry up my brain!"" it is one of the movie's most tragic, saddest moments. The movie also indulges in the players come to play and here in the extensive treatment of it, with Charlton Heston speaking a wonderful speech in rehearsal, we get the idea that not only is it a play within the play, Hamlet taking it over to catch the king, but, in the production in Elizabethan times, it too might've been thought of as a bonus play tossed in as a distracting interlude, to clear the palate, before getting back to the plot. While it is not entirely clear that Billy Crystal was needed to give the whole of the gravedigger's extensive wordplay prior to Hamlet's Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him, Horatio, and Robin Williams' part near the end seems extraneous, and, earlier, Gerard Depardieu shows up saying only one-liners each one of which ends with my lord, all this seems like a concerted effort by Brannagh to prove his point that it is a pantomime ensemble of mixed moods with, if it wishes, throwaway excess, that one must wiggle, taking or leaving as one goes, through to the end. Also unique in this outing is the fact that at the end the Norwegian troops of Fortenbras come to take over, as Hamlet, Gertrude and the king are all killed, ending things in a rousing history play action-movie orientation. The movie then ends nicely with a toppling of the statue of his father that haunted Hamlet out front, leaving the old king fallen on the ground of his fallen kingdom, the end. So, FOUR HOURS, have at it, but if you 1) release yourself from Hamletcentrism, and 2) relax into the ""popcorn variety"" show aspect of the outing, there are infinite pleasures to be had, comic and so very tragic, in this terrific telling of the tale.",Hamlet
44,AndreiPavlov,Greatness doth tread upon weakness,5,17 August 2007,"It's one of those rare productions, which I like and dislike almost equally and it goes passionately both ways. The points which go first are most influential.What I like about this movie. 1) The actors' dramatic performances (speech, gestures, emotional response). 2) The unabridged text of the original (of course I did not sit with the text near my TV-set to compare, but it seems to be really without cuts). 3) Costumes and sets.What I do not like. 1) The change of epoch (I consider it to be a terrible mistake). 2) The main actor is a bit too old to play Hamlet and Mrs Kate Winslet is a bit too old for Ophelia - no cosmetics can conceal it and I greatly dislike Hamlet's small beard. 3) Uneven pace (it often looks that the actors are ""speeding it all up"" or ""slowing it all down"" intentionally, which does not look natural.Mark me, I have not mentioned the running time in cons. When the production concerns a classic of the greatest literature creations and treats it almost word for word, time does not matter to me. Some more details on the actors' oral talent.quote HAMLET That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. OPHELIA What is, my lord? HAMLET Nothing. unquoteThe way Mr Kenneth Branagh pronounces ""nothing"" opens a new interpretation to the words and a new wicked pun.quote HAMLET Words, words, words. ... HAMLET Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward. ... HAMLET These tedious old fools! unquoteGreatly pronounced and acted. Deserves to be memorized by a foreign student.quote First Player 'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced: But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made, Unless things mortal move them not at all, Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, And passion in the gods.' unquoteA feast for ears. Performed by Mr Charlton Heston of course. No wonder that this actor did have all the ability to live Hamlet on stage verbally and emotionally, but alas, not physically.By drawing these examples I am just stressing the fact that the whole production can be listened over the radio and enjoyed in its full flood.Therefore, 5 out of 10. I really hate to give this low mark to this production while it is a very strong performance but the negative sides mentioned above are very menacing. And one more thing: the irony is that our ""Hamlet"" is the greatest. Thank you for attention.",Hamlet
45,BadWebDiver,The best Shakespeare film!,9,13 April 2002,"And I'm not kidding! Unlike other recent adaptations of Shakespearian plays where you get a bunch of nervous artist who look like they're trying to play Shakespeare; what we have here is a lot of top-class professionals who really strut their stuff. I once read a critic who said that Branagh performs Shakespeare like it's street-talk (and I think that's the best compliment you could pay an actor), and in this production he's finally managed to imbue that to his cast. So we get the likes of Derek Jacobi, Charlton Heston, Judi Dench, Nicholas Farrell, Kate Winslet, Brian Blessed, Rufus Sewell, Branagh regular Richard Briers, and of course Branagh himself who really make their characters chat.But particular mention should go to the comic performances of Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. Osric has always been one of my favourite Shakespearian characters, and one that I've personally dreamed of playing. I thought this even before I saw Robin Williams in the role, but he just confirms my interest in the guy; though I would prefer Osric to be a bit more foppish. I think it's great fun that Robin Williams is the only one who uses a corny Danish accent here.And what about Billy Crystal? This is the first time I've seen the gravedigger scene and actually laughed at the jokes! This shows that a) it takes an actor with a sense of comedy to play a comic character & scene; and b) the best comic actors can make even the oldest gags work.With HENRY V I thought Branagh was slightly behind the Laurence Olivier version (I liked the reproduction of the Globe theatre in Olivier's HENRY); but here I think Kenneth Branagh has finally surpassed Olivier. I've never forgiven Laurence Olivier for cutting Rosencrantz & Guildenstein out of his production.(Spoiler warning!)Perhaps having Claudius getting clobbered with a candelabra was going a tad over the top, but overall this is a magnificent production. Let us hope that this film is generally regarded as the definitive screen version of this famous play.",Hamlet
46,gilleliath,good for students,7,17 June 2021,"For a student, this is the version of Hamlet I'd recommend. It covers pretty much the whole play, and no other film does as much to help the viewer understand the meaning of what is being said. From that point of view, Kenneth Branagh can be commended. However he makes a brittle, sometimes even sarcastic Prince; and as director he creates an over-glossy world that feels not like any real place, but like a puppet show.There is much less stunt casting of American stars than in his Much Ado About Nothing, fortunately: on the whole, such people are not equipped to do Shakespeare. They can't understand the lines and, even if they could, would struggle to deliver so much verbiage with meaning, Jack Lemmon is a highly incongruous presence as guardsman Marcellus, but Charlton Heston is actually good as the Player King - both minor parts.It's now 25 years since this, the last major screen version. Have people given up filming Shakespeare? Personally I like the raw authenticity of the black and white Russian version.",Hamlet
47,vox-sane,Is This the Greatest Movie Ever Made?,8,6 April 2000,"No. But it is good. And it was necessary. Someone had to perform a complete HAMLET for posterity, and Branagh had the sense to fill it full of actors worth listening to.Shakespeare's plays were meant to be performed, not read. For modern performances, the plays are usually hacked to bits and truncated to fit contemporary attention-spans. Even his better plays, while wonderful, are not particularly cinematic unless they are handled by imaginative directors and actors who understand what they are saying.Branagh's greatest mistake was trying for epic grandeur.One reason HAMLET is superior to other plays is that it stays put. HAMLET is tightly confined to one place. In other Shakespeare plays characters wander lonely heaths, they gallivant through forests, they storm battlefields, they travel recklessly from town to town. The denizens of HAMLET are stuck in Elsinore. People come and go, but the play's only departure from the castle is to a graveyard.Branagh opens the play out somewhat by setting exteriors at the home of the Duke of Marlborough. For the most part, however, the play remains stage-bound. The famous ""mirror set"" is impressive at first, but it grows tiresome. It's like being stuck for four hours in a gaudy waiting-room. A few other little rooms exist in small scenes (Polonius' bedroom) but even the castle's nuthouse appears to be in the great, mirrored hall.Apart from his valiant attempt to make an epic out of non-epic material, Branagh does a creditable job. As with all his previous Shakespearean outings (notably HENRY V) Branagh had the sense to cast the movie with actors worth watching.Stand-out performances are by Derek Jacobi as Claudius (his and Branagh's acting styles are so similar they could be father and son rather than Hamlet's uncle. How long had Claudius been playing footsie with Gertrude?) The ghost requires a strong player, and Branagh plugged in Brian Blessed -- who, unfortunately, appears little-used since the ghost's part is vital but brief). Richard Briers plays Polonius as a smooth operator who has blundered into territory out of his ken. Always-reliable Charlton Heston plants his flag as the player king. Rufus Sewell is the first Fortinbras I've ever seen who actually seems integral to the plot. Nicholas Farrell set a new high mark for future Horatios.Though their parts seem almost unimportant in a four-hour version, Timothy Spall and Reece Dinsdale make a good team as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern -- two pleasant young men caught in an untenable squeeze between their king and a madman who can out-think them at every turn.Some of the casting choices are less than notable. Jack Lemmon, for instance. Didn't he used to be an *actor*? Has he ever heard of Shakespeare? The gravedigger, one of Shakespeare's clowns with nothing funny to actually say, requires a comedian; Billy Crystal is good enough, if a bit Bronx for Denmark. But Robin Williams' Osric is too far over the top. Branagh should have chosen an actor he could rein in.I will not quibble with Branagh's choice for notable actors in teensy parts. If he's going to show Reynaldo, Priam and Hecuba, he needs memorable actors. Gérard Depardieu can say ""Aye, my lord"" with the best of them. Ancient John Gielgud, unfortunately the last of the great actors of his generation (Olivier, Richardson, Redgrave, etc.) has no lines but he knows how to deliver a pratfall and die.As for Branagh himself, arguably the best actor of his generation, he twitches a little much. He seems to forget that, in film, less is more. His wonder at his father's ghost is a wee tad too pop-eyed, and all his other expressions are perhaps a trifle mannered. Like Fonda in ""Mister Roberts"" and Stewart in ""Harvey"" perhaps Branagh has played the part too many times to sustain any spontaneity. Still, he's a strong enough actor to hold one's attention for four hours, and the movie is dynamic so long as Branagh remains on-screen or only slightly off it.Where this movie fails is the curse suffered by every HAMLET. A ghostly murder story with intrigue within the castle and the threat of war from without, HAMLET the play builds to a frenzied climax -- and then Hamlet is packed off to England while the other characters carry on in Elsinore without him. Hamlet's departure knocks the play down and it never regains its energy. This is not Branagh's fault, but Shakespeare's. Not foreseeing movies, Shakespeare probably wrote this pause to give the actor playing Hamlet a well-earned breather.This means everything after Hamlet's confrontation with Claudius following ""The Mousetrap"" feels like denouement. The movie would have been better in two parts, HAMLET, and HAMLET II: RETURN FOR VENGEANCE.In this HAMLET, Claudius slaps the prince. maybe Branagh should have altered the text to make Hamlet pull a shiv and dispatch Claudius there and then. It would have departed from fidelity to the play, but it would have improved the picture.If you're a fan of Shakespeare generally or HAMLET in particular, this movie is worth a viewing. If, like me, you are obsessed with HAMLET, it's a keeper you'll watch again and again. I'd like to say it's a movie where you'll discover something new every time you revisit it, but it's really a movie where you pretty much see everything worth seeing the first time around. Still, it's always lovely to hear so much Shakespeare recited by such a fine company of actors. Thank you, Kenneth, for making this possible.",Hamlet
48,adrongardner,It seems to me a sterile promontory,5,27 May 2013,"The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh.As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this ""full"" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why?It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English ""irony"" or ""juxtaposition"" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehIt isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud.No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours. Instead of a tormented prince in the midst of doomed love we are stuck with one merely in love with himself.",Hamlet
49,timmy_501,Great adaptation,9,20 February 2011,"With his film Hamlet, actor/director Kenneth Branagh became the first film-maker to adapt the entirety of Shakespeare's play to film. It's no mean feat that he managed to do this in a way that truly makes the material seem cinematic without losing any of the essence of the work as it was originally created.Although most films don't have anywhere near the amount of dialogue that Hamlet does, the film doesn't suffer as much as it could have from an overabundance of words. The film is full of sumptuous visuals, particularly in the multitude of interior shots of the castle which called to mind the elegant interiors of Luchino Visconti's classic film The Leopard. It's true that the images might have been even more powerful if they had been allowed time to sink in without the distraction of the dialogue, but Branagh as a director does an excellent job of pacing the shots to get the best effect. Another way that he manages to avoid the pitfall of staginess is through judicious editing, particularly with the use of brief flashbacks to represent Hamlet's memories in one key scene. Between the great lines by Shakespeare and the great images by Branagh, this film's four hour runtime fairly whizzed by.Although Branagh was a bit older than I imagine Hamlet to be, he still manages to pull off his eponymous role quite well. The supporting cast is also good, particularly Billy Crystal in a brief but memorable role as a wisecracking gravedigger. Cameos by Jack Lemmon, Gerard Depardieu, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams are also successful to varying degrees but welcome nonetheless as they tend to add some much needed levity to the seriously tragic proceedings.I don't think this is the space to attempt to get into thematic material of Shakespeare's work but I will say that there really isn't much that has been lost in the adaptation process. Not only does this help enrich studies of the original text, it also is as successful in its own right as any straightforward Shakespeare adaptation I've seen. There's really very little to quibble about in this excellent film.",Hamlet
50,wandereramor,Hamlet as a big-budget mainstream film,6,11 February 2012,"Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court.While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever.It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.",Hamlet
51,colonel_green,"What a piece of work is ""Hamlet"".",10,2 July 2005,"Sir Richard Burbage; Sir John Gielgud; Sir Laurence Olivier; Orson Welles; Sir Derek Jacobi; Mel Gibson; these famous actors all share a common role: Hamlet, melancholy Prince of Denmark, the creation of William Shakespeare, the English language's greatest writer. To those names we can Kenneth Branagh, the icon of filmic Shakespeare.In 1996, fresh of the success of his own ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"", Branagh set out to adapt what is generally thought to be Shakespeare's magnum opus, ""Hamlet"". ""Hamlet"" is Shakespeare's longest play, and Prince Hamlet his biggest role, and thus had never made it on screen fully intact. Every previous version, from Sir Laurence's to Mel's, had pared the story down to its essence, which could still be brilliant, but just wasn't the same. Branagh vowed not to sacrifice a word, while he brought the story out of Medieval times in the 19th century.Branagh assembled a truly astonishing cast, especially considering that many of them play totally throwaway parts; Sir John Gielgud and Dame Judi Dench, for example, have no lines at all, while Robin Williams, Lord Richard Attenborough, Billy Crystal, and Gerard Depardieu all have only a handful of lines. The main roles in the film are handled by a pre-""Titanic"" Kate Winslet (Ophelia), Julie Christie (Gertrude), Sir Derek Jacobi (Claudius), Richard Briers (Polonius), Nicholas Farrell (Horatio), and Branagh himself (as the title character). Farrell, in particular, is a standout. His Horatio attains a depth of character that is absent in the pared-down versions of this story; the same can be said for other characters, especially Claudius.""Hamlet"" is directed with real showmanship, and has first-rate art direction and scoring. That Kenneth is soon to return to the world of filmed Shakespeare with an adaptation of ""As You Like It"" pleases me to no end. A 10/10 for ""Hamlet"", and let's see more.",Hamlet
52,pzanardo,A forgettable Hamlet,3,20 September 2000,"I consider ""Hamlet"" a very bad movie. The acting style is dreadful: the actors shoot bursts of words in a machine-gun way. The beauty of Shakespeare's verses is utterly spoiled: poetry needs a reasonable time to be enjoyed. What about playing Beethoven's last quartets at the tempo of a Tarantella Napoletana? I cannot stand the mania in recent British movies of representing Shakespeare's works in 19th century costumes. Yes, I know that in Elizabethan times the actors were dressed in contemporary robes. Indeed, I am deeply convinced that such habits were due to economical, or legal, by no means artistic reasons. As a matter of fact, feminine roles were played by boys, why not doing the same today? In any case, the film was made in the 20th century, not in the 19th.I don't see the point of the huge number of cameos by famous actors. In particular, the great but very old Jack Lemmon as the soldier is definitely ridiculous (alas!). I was amazed in checking that Branagh was just thirty-six when the movie was made: he looks considerably older, too old to be Hamlet. The photography is straightforward and the setting into an actual Danish royal palace is clumsy and grinding.By no means the sex scenes between Hamlet and Ophelia could be forgiven. They are preposterous for a film which boasts strict fidelity to Shakespeare's work: in the tragedy it is (almost) openly stated that Ophelia is virgin (and that she would like to change her status). And the very idea the fiancee of a prince be non-chaste was so totally inconceivable in the 16th (and 19th) century, that these sex scenes are even more grotesque than coarse and inappropriate.",Hamlet

I was fortunate enough to see it in 70MM at a local arthouse theater and having read the play several times and seen every filmed version, it finally all made sense. The performances were spectacular all around and the cast was nonpareil. One is nearly in tears at the story within the story as told by Charleton Heston (one of the players) and acted by the great Sir John Gielgud.

56,Funky A,Absolutely wonderful!,10,25 August 2000,"Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is a wonderful movie. A beautiful adaptation of Shakespeare's play, this movie is what movies are all about. Even though it is long(4 hours!!!), it is never boring. Visually, this movie is a real delight. The settings are breathtaking  and are captured on 70mm film.  I would never have suspected the impact it has on the quality of the picture. It is simply astonishing. I can't say anything wrong about William Shakespeare's fantastic play. It is a marvelous story. But I'm sure it can become boring if the director doesn't know what to do with such a text. This is not Branagh's case. While his passion for Shakespeare may seem like an obsession, the results are simply incredible. Branagh seems to have read Hamlet so many times he has become the man to understand it the most after The Bard himself. He delivers it in a form which suits the play incredibly well. Because of his directing and of his powerful performance as Hamlet. Energy seems to flow relentlessly in his body while he plays, with obvious pleasure, the Danish prince. But the rest of the cast his also excellent. Kate Winslet is magnificent as Orphelia. Derek Jacobi is perfect as Claudius. He is more than just ""the guy who killed the king and sleeps with the widow"". He his a character which you hate, but also respect. Claudius is a character as interesting as Hamlet. Julie Christie is also perfectly cast as Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. Nicholas Farrell, an actor I had never heard of, was impressive as Horatio. Robin Williams had a small role as a shy soldier, the opposite of his usual characters. It was fun to see him being good in a different role. Billy Crystal was very funny as a gravedigger with a gift for playing with words. It is fun to see Gérard Depardieu appear for 5 minutes. Even Jack Lemmon, which some fellow IMDb reviewers said was annoying as Marcellus, was, in my humble opinion, good. But of all the cameos, the most impressive was Charlton Heston as an actor. His voice is as powerful has back in the days of Ben-Hur, and his charisma is intact. Surprisingly, I only missed a few lines of the text. But an even bigger surprise was that this movie was not only fascinating, but also entertaining. The only negative thing I can say is that the beautiful score by Patrick Doyle is sometimes a bit too loud. This is actually the only problem I have found to this movie!!!

58,mrspasm,Epic Fail,1,12 June 2009,"'To be or not to be'- is that a question? Yes, it is. Is it a good question? No, it is not. In fact, it's not even proper English. For someone who is supposedly the best writer ever, his English ain't too good. He should really have said something like 'Should I be doing this, or should I just top myself?' or even better 'if I'm not me, then who da hell am i!?' Hamlet is a Shakespeare Comedy based on an earlier work by Chaser or someone. They tried to make us study this in school, but most of us couldn't even read it! I don't know why they don't make us read comics, it would be easier, more exciting, more fulfilling, and would make more kids turn up to class. In fact, everyone knows that books and reading is pretty much obsolete these days so they should really just show classic movies or TV shows like The A-Team, CHiPs, and Superted. 'What have we got next? Asked Neville when we were in school. 'English I think' I replied. 'Balls to that, man, I'm away for a walk'. Yes, when English came around most of us most of the time mostly sat outside the room for most of the class, mostly because we were bored, but mostly because there was a radiator we could stand against. It was cold in school; so cold. Thinking about it now gives me the shivery chills. Brrrr. I think I'll put some gloves on.This film as far as I know follows the novel word for word, scene for scene. This is to be expected, given that Shakespears's Grandson Kenneth Brana stars and directs. There was controversy here as Brana claimed sole writing credits, meaning that Shakespeare never saw a penny, or a shilling as the case may be. Given the length of the book (over 2 thousand pages) the film is actually 7 hours long. This is about 6 hours longer than any person should be expected to sit in any one place. The story is hardly an original one; a man wants revenge for the murder of his father by his mother's lover. Simple. Why it takes so long to tell this story I don't know. Rather than showing the murder, showing Hamlet (what sort of a name is that anyway!?) finding out, and then chasing Alan Rickman and killing him would have been much easier and pleasing or the eye. Instead he fills it up with pointless characters like Roseypants and Glidingbum, wastes time with 'solitudies' (scenes where a character talks to himself for 10 minutes) and confusing sexy times with his crazy sister Kate Beckinsale. I admit that some of the clothes look nice, but if I wanted to look at fancy costumes I would go to Coventry. There is a scene with a ghost and it was a little spooky, but I would hardly call it scary- another wasted opportunity. There is a sword fight, but there are better sword fight in Once Upon A Time In China and any number of Hong Kung movies. Brana clearly doesn't know how to 'stage' an 'action' 'scene'. All he can do is talk, and talk wear black, then talk some more. This is 10 hours of my life I will never get back. GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY BANA! If not, I'm coming to Shrewsbury and I'm gonna steal Shakespeer's pantaloons! Best Scene: When I fell asleep and dreamt that I was driving a tank through a field of zombies. Crrrrunnch!

60,quin1974,"Riveting, although not for all tastes",9,12 February 2001,"1. I think it was a treat to for once see and hear the complete unabridged text as it was meant by the most famous bard in the world.2. The enormous amount of talent portraying the famous characters, Branagh as Hamlet (with bleached hair), Winslet as Ophelia (portraying her as if she is a veteran stage performer) for starters are absolutely enormous in their roles. The rest of the principal and supporting cast have transcended their past careers and have put in all of their best efforts to complete this as the masterpiece it has ultimately become. Combine this with point 1 and you get a very good movie.Combine 1 and 2 with the brilliant set building and cinematography and what do you get? A Kenneth Branagh adaptation of a Shakespeare play. As we have seen before with Much Ado About Nothing and Henry V this man knows Shakespeare by heart and is not afraid to give his own version of the tales and twists in these plays. In this version of Hamlet he portrays Hamlet as a bitter, egotistical self-absorbed person who is absolutely certain of his step-father's guilt and therefor feigns his own insanity which causes him to be blind to suffering he puts the people around him through. In the original piece as written by W.S. Hamlet is much more insecure. I don't say this is a bad thing, because as we have seen in the past the plays by W.S. are very much subject to interpretation and view (i.e. Romeo + Juliet, 1996), Branagh gave a very grim edge to the character which I liked.The fact the complete text, except for a few words altered, was used in chronological order, was a very bold step. Meaning that now the movie amounted to about 242 minutes, but if you watch this on your VCR in parts (2 or 3) you will be able to do it. Don't let the length discourage you. This is really worth your while.The set building was enormous, creating this 18th century castle in Denmark (not actually in Denmark) was fabulous as were the sets outside on the grounds of the castle. Ophelia's burial scene was very well executed and gave the story the amount of depth and understanding that one needs when you are not too familiar with the story which unfolds in such glamour in front of one's eyes.Truly a must for Shakespeare fans and a definite challenge for the people who are not too familiar with the bard's work. See this and be amazed (I don't condemn you if you don't manage to finish it). Repeated viewing is certainly mandatory with this masterpiece.9/10",Hamlet

62,shattenjager777,One of the greatest films of all time,10,9 May 2003,"Many who watch Shakespeare films tend to classify them in a separate category from all others. While often that differentiation is justified, Kenneth Branagh presents a Hamlet which transcends such a classification.The four-hour film is closer to the play in language (in fact, almost word-for-word) even than any stage production of the 3,880-line play that one can hope to see in one's lifetime. However, that is not the level of the film that truly separates it from most Shakespeare adaptations. The reason this film escapes that classification is that it is Branagh's film, not Shakespeare's. Where many directors seem intimidated by Shakespeare's language and thus place it as a king above all else as they are followers of Shakespeare, Branagh seems to feel as though he is Shakespeare's partner in the film and thus is willing to use daring camera shots and deeply psychological performances.The first thing that must be said is that the complete text makes a fuller, richer, ironically faster-moving and easier-to-follow, and simply better experience than the severely cut version of Olivier's film or the severely cut, rearranged, and rewritten version of Zeffirelli's film. However, there is no need to go into the intricasies of this point here--suffice to say that the script, being the play nearly exactly (there are a few places where words or lines must be chosen from contradictory versions of the play--most famously the line ""Oh that this too solid/sullied flesh would melt""--or Branagh slightly modernizes lines, altering a word here and there), is almost flawless.The acting is also wonderful. Branagh's Hamlet is perfect, being just a shade below the almost-over-the-top hysterics of Derek Jacobi's performance in the BBC production while keeping Hamlet intensely theatrical and bordering on, if not creeping into, real madness and not taking him to the point of Mel Gibson's and Laurence Olivier's swashbuckling Hamlets. He also pulls of the stoic fifth act Hamlet remarkably well, something that Jacobi struggled with. Meanwhile, Brian Blessed gives a stirring performance as the ghost, surprising in its restraint. Derek Jacobi, one of the most under-appreciated actors on earth, manages to take a character who has little to him as written (no, he's not a bloat king, but he's not that much more) and turn him into something more: a slimy, slithering political operator and sexual fiend. Kate Winslet also (as always) shines in a wonderful performance as Ophelia, playing her absolutely perfectly. Billy Crystal also deserves notice for his fun cameo as the first gravedigger, seeming to understand the incredible intellectualism the character must exude (no one else can stand up to Hamlet intellectually, remember) and still be a smart alec. The only disappointments here are Jack Lemmon, who sounds woefully out of his element in the worst performance of a man who gave many brilliant ones before and after, and Rufus Sewell, who doesn't have the physicality for Laertes and does not seem to be either the company man who does what he's told or the adventurer Laertes reads as being.Branagh's direction is marvellous. He uses flashbacks, created movements with the camera or sequences not written (Hamlet's chase of Claudius and Laertes through the halls, for example), and a barrage of other visual tricks to keep the audience interested for over four hours. The huge number of close-ups and extreme close-ups allow the actors to go on display even more so than they otherwise would, and to great effect, since almost all of them are so brilliant. He also creates a simply beautiful film, something too often not done in recent times.All in all, Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is the quintessential ""Hamlet."" I can understand Olivier fans detesting it, because the two interpretations do not agree at any point, Olivier's being an Oedipal story of ""a man who cannot make up his mind"" and Branagh's being far more complex and not at all Oedipal. However, Branagh has the theatricality and energy to play this Hamlet to the hilt to anchor a beautiful, perfectly acted production. I recommend this film to anyone who can sit for four hours, even if they're not Shakespeare fans.",Hamlet
63,FISHCAKE,"If you're looking for a complete realisation of the First Folio Hamlet, this may be it.",10,15 July 2001,"Just what is too long for a rendering of Shakespeare's HAMLET? If, like me, you love every word gem of the Bard, there is no ""too long"", even a tad. Bertram Kliman's ""Three Text Hamlet"" gives the First and Second Quarto and the First Folio versions in parallel columns. The first two are much shorter, and most scholars and dramaturgs use them only for emendations to the Folio text. It looks like Kenneth Branagh has used just about all of the First Folio, with maybe a pick here and there from the Quartos. Whatever, he has created a magnificent film. Casting, background, direction and camera work defy criticism. Using Blenheim Castle as Elsinore and moving action forward in time does make for some of the usual anachronisms, but then Shakespeare was guilty of plenty of these himself. In any case, the problems are deftly handled. Treat yourself to a splendid HAMLET!",Hamlet

Of course these modern Ophelias are not white-dressed, flower-decorated angels of sumptuous Victorian paintings, harking back the play's ""fair and unpolluted"" madwoman - this time it's Kate Winslet's turn to lose her mind, and she does it in coarse, realistic manner.

65,ctrout,The Best Version of Shakespeare's Best Play,10,13 September 2006,"William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play. Not only is it the best movie version of it, but it's also the only complete version of Hamlet. Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is simply genius. Not only because it was written by Shakespeare, but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing, even if it went just over four hours.We all know the story of the Prince of Denmark and his plot to avenge his father's death, so I won't go into the details of the story. I will, however, tell you that the best part of this Hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography, but the actors' interpretations of each character. I doubt you'll find a better Polonius than Richard Briers' delicious portrayal. Plus, you can't go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi, a regular among Shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to Hamlet.Of course, we must talk about Kenneth Branagh. He wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with Shakespeare, Henry V. He outdoes himself with Hamlet. Sure, Olivier's presence was captivating, but I think Branagh's performance is wonderful. When you watch him on screen, it's almost as if he knew exactly how Shakespeare wanted the role to be played. How he wasn't nominated for an Oscar is a total mystery. At least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for Screenplay. I guess they know good writing when they see it though. All in all, you'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the Bard's best play. To say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement. If you love this play and are a fan of Shakespeare, you definitely need to check this movie out. Even if you don't really care for Shakespeare, the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film. You may not think you'll be able to sit through all of it at once, but you'll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more.",Hamlet
66,DesbUK,One of the most remarkable adaptations of Shakespeare on screen,8,26 March 2011,"This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions.The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity.But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles.A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.",Hamlet
67,stiv-7,"Branagh's Masterpiece? No, but close.",9,10 October 2000,"I first watched this in preparation for a graveyard shift, fully expecting to fall asleep; after all, at 4 hours long, is it really possible for such an intellectual film to maintain one's attention, especially at 3am? I was pleasantly surprised and found myself thoroughly absorbed by this adaptation. It's not his best (that would be Henry V), but it's still better than some other actor/directors' ""masterpieces"". Some quibble about the stunt casting and the addition of intimate scenes between Hamlet and Ophelia, to which I respond that: 1) some people won't even watch a movie unless it's got recognisable names in it, and 2) keep in mind that these scenes are rather ethereal; it's never made clear whether they actually happened or if they are mere fantasy (like similar scenes in The Last Temptation of Christ). Suffice it to say that Branagh has pulled off what some would consider impossible.This is a personal favourite, and I actually enjoyed Zeffirelli's adaptation! However, it doesn't hold a candle to this one if for only one reason; Branagh actually got Charlton Heston to act without doing any damage to the scenery! I'm waiting, rather impatiently for his next adaptation, as well as the DVD of this one.",Hamlet
68,JasonLeeSmith,Disappointing,6,28 March 2006,"I went into ""Hamlet"" with exceptionally high hopes, having liked most of Brannagh's other movies. I had also frequently listened to the BBC radio production of ""Hamlet"" starring Brannagh and the rest of the Royal Shakespeare Company, many of whom also appeared in the film. When I saw the film version, though, I thought that the acting was terrible. I read someone who had commented on this movie that there was ""no emotion...just volume."" I feel that's an accurate assessment. The movie just devolved into a shouting match between all of the principle characters. It was very disappointing to see, especially considering how good the radio production with essentially the same cast had been.Riding on the tails of his previous successes with ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" Branngh clearly tried to pull out all the stops with this production, and that may have also worked against him. A huge number of big name stars were signed up to do cameos, and I found such excessive stunt-casting to be disconcerting. In every scene there seemed to be another celebrity trying to make the most of his or her couple of minutes of screen time.I did enjoy the cinematography, which seemed to put you right in the middle of the action. In retrospect, I remember it almost as if I had been watching a 3-D movie. The sets were beautiful, and some of the scenes were genuinely stunning -- I think in particular of the scene at the end where Fortinbras' (sorry if I mispelled it) troops invaded Elsinore.Brannagh seemed to have been staking his reputation on this movie, which I suspect he wanted to be viewed as his masterwork. The trouble was that he seemed to try too hard, and the movie came across as forced. There were many good points to the movie, but I feel they just could not overcome the poor direction and lousy acting which was present.",Hamlet
69,daved-3,possibly the best Hamlet ever,10,5 September 1999,"Branaugh once again proves his brilliance as a director with this inspired version of Hamlet.  After the admirable but flat version by Zefferelli, it's nice to see the passion and fire brought back to material that now seems both familiar yet fresh.  Yes, some scenes have no purpose, but blame Shakespeare for that.  Kate Winslet is extremely impressive as Ophelia, and Derek Jacobi (who did an even better job as Hamlet in the BBC production) makes Claudius complex and not entirely unsympathetic.  And if Claudius is complex, Branaugh makes Hamlet a complete cipher, understandable but remote at the same time, a character with limitless depths. If the acting is superb, the set design and costumes are incredible; the set design of the castle of Elsinore, with its one-way mirrors and secret passages, resembles the labyrinthian nature of the plot and the characters. It is what Branaugh aspired to, the definitive Hamlet.",Hamlet
70,MoneyMagnet,Flawed but worthwhile,7,25 August 2007,"A four-hour HAMLET would give any mortal director a chance to both illuminate the material and spoil it, and this film proves it. Branagh gives an uneven but occasionally brilliant performance, and not surprisingly his best moments come in scenes which are usually cut from abridged productions (such as his initial confrontation with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern - ""Were you sent for?"" and the well-staged sequence when the hapless duo are sent to fetch Hamlet after Polonius' death.) It's moments like these when you're grateful that Branagh decided to embark on such a massive project. Far less successful are moments when Branagh thinks he's remaking LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (""How all occasions do inform against me"" with its overblown scoring and obvious blue-screen simply does... not... work.) Surprisingly, a good deal of the stunt casting really does work. The most disappointing supporting performance, alas, is Julie Christie as Gertrude, who plays the queen merely as a shallow, whiny aristocrat who seems more concerned about losing face with the Social Register than with any deeper moral twinges. If she were my mom I'd be depressed too. Derek Jacobi gives a good but not spectacular performance as Claudius (one keeps thinking back to his own performance as Hamlet in the 1980 BBC production, truly one of the most brilliant Hamlets of the modern era). Kate Winslet as Ophelia is very good, as are Richard Briers as Polonius and Michael Maloney as Laertes. Nick Farrell is a little over-the-top in the pivotal role of Horatio.And yes, some of the liberties Branagh takes with the text, in the form of intercut scenes without dialogue, are just over the top. I'm not a fan of his notion that Hamlet and Ophelia were doing the nasty: totally uncalled-for. But other liberties do seem to work, particularly his decision to stress the idea of Denmark as a dying nation under foreign attack. (We forget that classical tragedy was not just about characters, but about royal characters whose fate was tied to the fate of nations.) When Fortinbras' men finally burst through the plate glass windows, it's rather shocking, if only because Tim Harvey's set design is totally brilliant and the most original thing about Branagh's film: Elsinore as a baroque Germanic palace from the Bismarck era, with a hall of mirrors and a labyrinth of false bookcases, sliding doors, and secret rooms. Why he didn't win an Oscar for his production design is utterly beyond me. His Elsinore totally makes the movie. The huge size of the great hall of Elsinore makes for a staging of the final duel that allows both novel choices and somewhat silly ones. (I had a brief flashback to the Grand Guignol finale of DEAD AGAIN when Hamlet hurled his sword at Claudius and then sent a chandelier flying. However, would Shakespeare really have disapproved? The actual death of Claudius in the play is garish enough.) Usually Patrick Doyle is Branagh's most valuable artistic crew member but I have to give it to Tim Harvey here. Doyle's score is hit and miss, too insistent in places though properly subtle in others. It's not a particularly helpful score, however.At four hours long, there's plenty to praise and criticize in this film. It's no masterpiece, but hardly a waste of time.",Hamlet

This not only because it achieved a faithful adaptation of this English classic drama, but also gives a majesty and elegance that make up the more stylized version of this tragedy. Here photography but especially the art design make up the strongest pillars to recreate a superb Danish castle that turns out to be another cast member. It is also interesting the casting that Branagh chose to interpret secondary roles, then we see a gallery of big players that have small roles and give a freshness to the density of a film that lasts more than four hours. Robin Williams, Richard Attenborough, Billy Crrystal, Judy Dench and even Charlton Heston make up characters that strengthen the good interpretations of Julie Christie, Kate Winslet and Derek Jacobi, not that well for Branagh that for my taste is a very over acting Hamlet. Yet the result is for me one of the best adaptations of this English playwright and a good film that brings us closer to knowing more about the most beautiful drama of history.",Hamlet
73,stancym-1,Compare and Contrast with another version I just saw,10,1 July 2013,"Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius?The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.",Hamlet
74,madbeast,Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet,2,21 December 2004,"This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of ""Hamlet"" to ever reach the screen. Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket, having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of ""ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack"" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford's Kate.Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the ""How All Occasions Inform Against Me"" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's ""I'll never be hungry again."" This may serve Branagh's ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered ""Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet."" Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. Branagh's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control.",Hamlet

This also included Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as the actor.Branagh's performance of the Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy (Which again is usually cut out) is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows. It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding.Branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience.This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling, brilliant acting,and incredible direction.

I'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play. The acting is extremely strong (With a cast that features Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal how can you lose?) and the change in time period (Looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800's) plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the Shakespearean play will get chills from.

If the latter reason compels you, don't bother.This long, heinous exercise in ego masturbation is one example of how one actor can take himself too seriously. Kenneth Brannagh, a highly regarded British darling, stars as Hamlet, a role far too young for a man of KB's age to play. His over-the-top portrayal of the Prince of Denmark would probably have been perfect for a huge stage production, but seems ridiculously hammy, even in this lavish setting.If you want a good laugh, watch Gerard Depardieu's cameo scene. Utilizing this beloved French actor in a scene that clearly displays his lack of English skills, it's hilarious to watch him him repeat over and over ""Aye, my Lord"" and ""Yes, my Lord,"" especially since he obviously doesn't understand what Hamlet is saying to him.I hate to admit this, but even Mel Gibson's Hamlet surpasses this one, if only for the fact that it's more to the point and easier for younger students of Shakespeare to comprehend.If you want to see Shakepeare works done well, watch Ian McKellan in Richard III.

Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made ""Hamlet"" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively.

80,Oriel,Ambitious disappointment,6,3 August 1999,"Branagh's Hamlet--both character and film--suffers from the same tendency that destroyed his Frankenstein: he simply goes overboard.  When he's reined in, Branagh can turn in a fine performance, but too often he overacts, overdirects, overdoes generally, as here.  I eagerly anticipated this Hamlet both as a reader and as a teacher, but discovered an overblown spectacle full of Hollywood-style excess, souped-up sex and violence, overpowering (and distracting) music, and performances that substitute volume for emotion.Branagh himself is the worst offender here, bellowing his ""how all occasions do inform against me"" soliloquy as if in competition with the soundtrack, hardly even pausing for breath, let alone for a glimpse of feeling.  The most crushing disappointment is the crucial ""to be or not to be"" speech, again devoid of any sense of reflection or self-awareness, delivered in a hasty monotone for all the world as if Branagh was trying to spit it out quickly before he forgot it.  This is not the world-class acting the text deserves; if not for the sheer spectacle and the impressive (i.e. famous) cast, this film would surely not be ranked as highly.Even the purportedly authentic screenplay makes several crucial interpretive choices for the viewer and completely rewrites the nature of Fortinbras's final entrance into Elsinore.  The only bright points are Derek Jacobi, who offers some emotional complexity as Claudius, and a Gertrude who finally seems to have a backbone.  The absence of the Oedipal interpretation is welcome, but this alone cannot place this disastrous film above the Mel Gibson version, which remains its superior.  The volume of laudatory reviews for this foolish film depresses me--but at least it may bring some new readers to the play itself, which _does_ deserve this kind of admiration.",Hamlet

A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music.The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10",Hamlet
83,bigswede1295,Pure Cinematic Joy,10,5 December 1999,"The best thing about this movie?  Mr. Branagh realizes that there is absolutely no reason to tamper with the text.  Simply let the cast revel in the marvelous words, as penned by William Shakespeare.  And the strictly A-list cast assembled by Mr. Branagh do nothing short of revel in the language that the Bard penned for them.  As for the direction, Mr. Branagh's interpretation is a happy disjuncture from Laurence Olivier's earlier vision, and it throws just enough of a hat to Ian McKellan's RICHARD III to work.  This film is a creature of utter joy, love, and a watermark in cinematic achievement.",Hamlet
84,du_man,Mostly Excellent Version of Shakespeare's Classic,9,20 May 2005,"* * * ½ (out of four)In Denmark in what appears to be the late 19th century, the king is killed. His son, Hamlet (Kenneth Branaugh) is then visited by the ghost of his father, who tells him that his uncle, Claudius (Derek Jacobi), killed him in order to 1, take the thrown, 2, take his wife, Gertrude (Julie Christie), and 3, make the already edgy Hamlet go completely nuts (or so it seems). Okay, that last one probably wasn't the intent, but it certainly turns out to be the result, and Hamlet pushes his love, the fair Ophilia (Kate Winslet), completely away from him. Her father Polonius and brother Laertes both oppose any continuance of the romance, which pushes him further over the edge, and the march of the Norwegian armies, led by Fortinbras (Rufus Sewell), on Denmark throws him completely overboard. Kenneth Branaugh's version of Shakespeare's classic is the complete play. Practically every line of dialogue is uttered (except perhaps one or two here and there), resulting in a 4 hour film. Unfortunately, the film is kind of on and off, with some scenes managing to be absolutely brilliant and others rather boring. The first hour is so lumpy it's pretty off-putting other than a moment here and there but then Moses comes in to save the day. More or less. At this point, Charlton Heston comes in to do the role of the Player King. And, for the approximately five minutes he's on stage, he gives speeches so powerfully and emotionally that you are practically forced into the movie, and from then on, you're in, and the occasional lags never quite o'ercrow your spirits. The cast is a little too big, with everyone down to the gratuitous extras being someone you've heard of (I mean, honestly, you cast Judi Dench and John Gielgud in a Shakespeare movie only to let them appear for 2 seconds without a line of dialogue in a pointless shot anyway?). However, most of them are quite good. Branaugh is a little stagy at times, but most of the time, he's superb. But the good supporting performances are what really pull you through the slow spots: Jacobi, Christie, Billy Crystal (as the gravedigger), whoever played Horatio, and especially Winslet are excellent, although none of them top Heston. All this excellence easily makes up for the rest of the cast, which is a mixture of: fine but no more, barely adequate (Jack Lemmon), expressive but one-dimensional (such as Sewell), completely wooden, and Robin Williams, who's great to watch usually but annoying and pointless here. (on a similar note, I was surprised Crystal did such a good job in his role, but he was more than up to the challenge; Williams might have been if he wasn't so recognizable and his beard wasn't so fake) In addition, the film works because the scenes that are brilliant --- such as Hamlet and Ophilia's stunningly performed dialogue after To Be or Not to Be, the beautifully made grave scenes, and the climax --- make up for the lulls just as well as the cast. It's also neat to see some of the characters like Claudius really becoming a full character, although Zeffrilli's version, despite being 90 minutes shorter, did a better job with Hamlet and especially Laertes. Another plus to this film is Patrick Doyle's score, which isn't great, but it does a fine job and has some superb passages (especially the aforementioned grave scenes). The cinematography (filmed in 70mm) is also quite good. Anyway, this film is definitely a mixed bag, but enough of it is excellent that the movie works, even if on the whole it's slightly inferior to the Zeffrilli/Gibson version.",Hamlet
85,Holden_Pike,an amazing achievement,10,27 September 1998,"Why didn't this pick up a bag full of Oscars? It is an amazing interpretaion of an oft-filmed/performed piece. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in wide-screen...the pan & scan really kills this film's wonderful cinematography and sets). Every frame is a painting.  Astounding. The play is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it is clear from the opening titles on. No Zefferelli here, just great storytelling the way only film can, but rarely does. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's murderous Uncle:  he doesn't play him as a mustache- curling evil villian, but a charming politician, allowing us to see why only Hamlet suspects foul play. Branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's fake/real madness and the burning revenge inside him. And the many cameos come off quite well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, unobtrusive if you are sucked into Branagh's vision the way I was. A mesmerizing piece.",Hamlet

It's great to see the whole thing completely uncut, although watching in one sitting is a marathon of an experience at 4 1/2 hours. The acting is in general quite exceptional, especially from Branagh, Kate Winslet, and Julie Christie. Many of the big american actors, which basically plays as a novelty, are actually pretty good in their roles, especially Charlton Heston, who steals every scene he's in as the player king. Billy Crystal is surprisingly good as the Gravedigger, and Robin Williams is quite acceptable in as Osric, but Jack Lemmmon...I don't know.

Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.",Hamlet

89,EddieK,A great way to make four hours fly by,10,4 January 2006,"Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" hits all the marks. The acting is magnificent, the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, the Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving. Oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named Will S., isn't too bad either. Film critics ribbed Branagh for receiving the films' fourth Oscar nod for ""adapting"" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one. I can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.Nearly every decision Branagh makes works brilliantly: the use of England's Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress, and the staging of ""To be or not to be"" in a hall of mirrors, to name a few. The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts can be distracting, but that's nitpicking. The principal cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicted nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet acutely depicts Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film. The final scenes magnify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations.Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is a bold, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery. It's arguably the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed  strong praise, but well deserved.",Hamlet

91,hollywood2k2,Shakespeare's greatest story brought to life.,9,21 December 1999,"What made this rendition of Shakespeare's Hamlet the best above all was Branagh's vision of recreating the entire play word for word. By doing this it stays true to Shakespeare's original work and pays homage.I also liked how it was created in a later time period which allowed Branagh to use props that weren't available in Shakespeare's time. I must add that I also like DiCapprio's Romeo and Juliet for the same reason. I feel that making Shakespeare's plays more contemporary it opens up younger audiences to his work. It gives the once boring works a new hip feel to it.I personally feel that this has been the greatest film adaptation of any Shakespearian play to date. I do wish someone makes a Macbeth like this Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet.I also recommend this to any high school student who has to read the play as a study aide. By watching it while reading you can understand the story a lot better but don't replace the written work, it's a classic.",Hamlet
92,eightx10,Exhausting,6,16 August 2000,"Yes, the visuals are grand.  Yes, there are some good performances. Unfortunately, Branagh's is not one of them.Kenneth Branagh is just too over-the-top and indulgent as Hamlet.  Maybe it is a matter of taste, but it is vitally important that you like the man who plays Hamlet as the character speaks more than the rest of the cast put together.Another problem is the script; it was written as a play, it was turned into a movie.  A really long movie.  I have nothing against long movies, but this one really was long on the dialogue.  It didn't have to be this way.  I think this play has to be cut a lot to make a tolerable movie.  (I would see the Zefferelii one.  Really conveys the spirit of the original without making it a marathon movie.)All in all, it was not terrible but I will not sit through it again.",Hamlet
93,Chessack,"A good rendition, but lacking in ""mood.""",8,29 September 2000,"This is a very good rendition of the play ""Hamlet"" -- and there are no scenes or lines cut (rare, when Hollywood adapts Shakespeare). However, I found it less than perfect (a surprise, given Branagh's other Shakespearian successes). I've always envisioned Hamlet as a ""dark"" and ""dismal"" play, and it's clear that's what Shakespeare intended. I found the sets too ""light and airy"" for Hamlet, and in particular, I found the climactic ending scene to be far too chaotic. The dialog was buried under clouds of running around up and down stairs, throwing things, swinging on chandeliers, etc -- and this is not, in my opinion, what Hamlet is supposed to be. Thus, while the acting is superb and the directing is good for most scenes, I thought this version really ruined the ""mood"" you expect from Hamlet.  For all its flaws and cuts of the play, in my opinion, the Mel Gibson/Franco Zefferelli version of Hamlet is sets a much better mood than does this version. However, that said, the acting is absolutely top-rate, and the cast is wonderful. It's worth seeing; just don't expect the mood of it to be exactly what you anticipate from Hamlet.",Hamlet
94,www-hiall,Too long!,1,4 June 2015,"This movie is too long. The plot drags and drags as the movie progresses. 80% of this movie is someone saying a monologue to them self in an empty room.

All these Shakespearean works are relatively the same, someone dies and someone plots revenge as the another character is slowly going crazy because of some ghost or witch they saw which made them crazy. Honestly, if Shakespeare didn't have sorcery and/or witchcraft in his plays, they would probably stink because those characters are only there to fill in the gaps in the story. All in all, if you like Shakespeare go see this film. If you don't, don't see this film. Also, the acting is great from Robin Williams, Kate Winslet, and Billy Crystal.",Hamlet
95,Solrac-3,A True Masterpiece,10,24 April 1999,"There were a lot of things going against this movie for me before I watched it.First, I was a typical high school senior, in a Shakespeare class I didn't really even like, much less understood half of! Shakespeare would be no more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration into his almost encrypted plays... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language.... and then I still wouldn't get most of it.Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that could be a good thing.Well let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood all the language as it was being performed. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare class. And here I was my mind opening and me understanding it. I was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! But lo and behold... when performed, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master, who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the high budget major motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acted amazingly by Brannagh and cast, somehow.... I understood what was going on. What was being said. The language is awesome and passionate. It allows for more raw emotion... when words can't describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can.I still hold to this day that Fist of The North Star (animated, english dub) is the greatest movie ever made. No movie provides more sheer entertainment. But for a movie to come close to dethroning Fist from that position (which Hamlet did -- it came close) is truly amazing.... awe inspiring. It wasn't a movie. It was an event.Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, TRULY powerful movies out there.This gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars. Yes yes.By the way, all you kids out there in a Shakespeare class... forget it. You're wasting you're time. You have to see the plays performed. Only then will justice be done to them.",Hamlet
96,reg-4,Very satisfying,9,5 November 1998,"Four hours? For many people this would seem an excessive amount of time to spend watching one film, but consider this: the average performance of Hamlet on stage is 4/5 hours, and it has been Shakespeare's most successful stage and film work for the past 395 years. That sends a clear message. This version, adapted by Kenneth Branagh and updated to the 19th century, has a fair claim to be up there with the best of them. There are several reasons for this. Firstly there is Branagh's personal love of Shakespeare. Following on from Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Othello, Branagh remains extraordinarily true to the original text, using 95% of the actual lines of the play. Secondly, there is the overall appearance of the film which, although set 250 years after it should be, remains true to the story of the play and provides the cast with the opportunity of speaking the original lines in a way that doesn't seem difficult. (As a student of English lit., I know how great an achievement this is) Also, the musical soundtrack is perfectly matched to the action of the film - something which is comparatively rare in Shakespearean adaptations. Finally, and surely most importantly, the performances. Branagh as Hamlet and Jacobi as Polonius are, as one has come to expect, superb, but there isn't a single bad performance here. Kate Winslet's Ophelia is one of the most convincing I have seen. Special mention must go to the American cast members. It is often said that American actors shouldn't attempt Shakespeare as they don't have the right accent. This is absurd. Jack Lemmon's cameo is the best thing he's done since Glengarry Glenross, and Billy Crystal is excellent as the jovial gravedigger. It may be true that Branagh has as big an ego as James Cameron, but consider this: he's a better director, and he can act and adapt as well.",Hamlet

The only weak performance (to me) was Julie Christie.  She seemed to have a time keeping up with the other, more classically trained performers.  I enjoyed Charleton Heston more this time around.  Although brief, his part was pivotal and he carried it without the histronics of his other work.  Maybe he's finally learned that less really is more!I purchased the movie and the movie poster for my English teacher husband. He uses both in his classroom.

With all the grace and elegance of the Godfather films, this movie sucks you in if you just relax and allow yourself to be absorbed.I'm waiting, patiently for a DVD version (please Kenneth no 4 hour commentary!) hopefully they will fix the crappy effects via CGI, but until then the lousy, cropped, two videocassettes will have to do.

I actually purchased the Blu-ray edition last year but I did not watch until last night. Hamlet - the play - is so intimate to me that I know it line by line and while a few lines are placed differently or a couple of words of the play dropped (literally two) this is the most complete version of Hamlet ever filmed and absolutely the finest.Branagh has such talent - as a writer, actor and director - and this interpretation of Hamlet is the best that I've ever seen.If you've a nice and large television and a good sound system, I would certainly recommend buying the Blu-ray version of Hamlet.

At first I thought Branagh was throwing the part away, perhaps too burdened by his production responsibilities; but then I realized he was just playing it straight.  And how welcome!  All our great actors have to color the part somehow:  Geilgud's melancholy, Olivier's indecisiveness, Gibson's bravura.

Branagh takes us back to an earlier style of acting, where performances (especially Shakespearean performances) were larger than life. In doing so he runs the risk of being labeled a scenery chewing ham, which for some reason is considered a negative thing. To my ears, however, there's nothing more exciting than listening to a good actor rip through a speech full of fire and fury, reminding us of the sheer beauty of the English language, and that's one of Branagh's great strengths. Remember his ""Once more into the breach"" from ""Henry V"", for example, or the St Crispin's day speech which had me ready to go out and kill some Frenchmen for him. ""Hamlet"" is full of such electrifying moments from the whole cast (except for Jack Lemmon, who sounded almost as though he had learned his lines phonetically) The sumptuous production, Patrick Doyle's rousing score and a great cast add up to four hours of cinematic magic.

Not more Fortinbras, though I've never trusted him. Marching through on his way to Poland?  Something's rotten...  Not more sex, though, hey, it's always welcome.  I just hoped for a more involved, a more charismatic, a more common, human, less elite, agressive, ambitious, antagonistic Hamlet from Kenneth Branagh, especially after watching his lighter adaptations of the comedies and Henry V.  I would love him anyway, but he's competing with Derek Jacobi's suave, soothing, loveable Claudius. Lecherous, treacherous, - but bloody? bawdy?

He's miles ahead of Mel Gibson's ""normal"" Hamlet, though. Gibson made a ""Hamlet"" for everyone who went to see ""Hamlet"" for the ACTION without all that TALK to spoil the fun. Whoever WANTED to SEE a normal Hamlet, anyway? If ever a character deserved to be neurotic and self-obsessed it's Hamlet (in all fairness, however, Gibson was only the 2nd worst Hamlet I ever saw; Nicol Williamson's whiney turn at it in 1968 made me physically ill, and his inexplainable contempt for the material shows in every frame).If only Branagh had cast Daniel Day Lewis in the lead!  What a ""Hamlet"" we might have had.  Complex, indulgent, dangerous, romantic AND tragic! Instead, we get a good Hamlet (and a flawed ""Hamlet""), but neither is great.The conception of this ""Hamlet"" is an ice palace motif.  For some reason, I kept expecting Jack Nicholson to rush out with an axe.  But it works, as do many of the supporting players.  Why, though, does it appear Branagh was reluctant to cast good looking men?  If we get to bask at the beauty and tremendous talent of Julie Christie (where has she been?) and Kate Winslet (the finest Ophelia I ever saw), why do we have to have such unmemorable faces on the males in the cast?Still, we take well-produced Shakespeare where we get him, and the full four-hours goes by nicely.",Hamlet
108,sinanipek,So why do I complain about its lightning?,7,7 December 2003,"The movie is almost perfect except the lightning. The actual lightning of the movie doesn't represent the dark, hopeless atmosphere of the original play. We know Shakespearean Theatre addresses people's imagination rather than his/her scenery. What you see is not more important in Hamlet than what you hear (or think or imagine). For this, in Shakesperean time, there were little settings on the stage. First of all, it was impossible to set the stage with props and furniture. Thus, Shakespeare supported his plays by adding extra verse which described the setting to the audience. This restriction freed Shakesperean theatre from putting the plays under several stage restraints  so that it came nearer to temporary movies in its fast editing.So why do I complain about its lightning? Still, I'm complaining about its lightning because Branagah ignored the stage conditions of the Shakesperean time. He used brilliantly lit, overfilled settings which bothers our eyes with its 18th century decoration and  fashion which is a distraction because the verse has enough decoration and description.Also, by ignoring the setting conditions of Shakesperean time, Branagah misses the chance to visualise the tragic look of the play. If Branagah used a low key lightning with strong contrast (i.e. dark and light together), the movie would seem more grotesque as it is.For me, the time shift of the play from ancient times to the 18th century is also useless and perturbing. We know that no Shakesperean play needs the adaptation of time to seem more contemporary. They are so universal and moving that any time shift is unnecessary.It is clear that Branagah wanted the audence like his movie very much so he shifted the time near 20th century; but, for me, it was useless.",Hamlet

It is starred by Keneath Barangh, Kate Winslet, Charlton Heston and Robin Williams. It is also directed by Barangh himself.The Plot is about a prince of Denmark who was suspicious of his father's death, until he meets the father's ghost his revenge on his uncle made him feigning his madness.The acting is brilliantly crafted and the 'picturization' of Denmark is unique. Some people cannot enjoy the movie the movie due to its lengthy time. The story is faithful to the play and what I enjoyed in the movie is Hamlet's madness, and comical situations created by other characters. In that movie, the annoying moment was Ophelia's madness but emotional at the same time who expressed her internal behavior meaninglessly. Yet, it is also implied that Hamlet also loves Ophelia in a platonic manner. The emotional part of the play was the moment while the ghost of King Hamlet leaves while the young Hamlet confronts his mother. The background music comes seldom but much more dramatically that we feel the intensity of the movie.The acting portrays the justice of the play in a much more uncut and intense manner. Some people may feel bored if they think about something entertaining. Overall, I think this film is brilliant as if we are watching the original play. We all have the characteristics of Hamlet. The set design is speechless but the only flaw is that it should get more essence but the acting foreshadowed it. The camera angle, I think it's a masterpiece. If you see it in theaters, you can get something of a different experience in the History of the Hollywood cinema. This play's brilliant and its essence are also brilliant. I am speechless overall.",Hamlet
111,movifan,One of the best films ever made.,10,26 July 1999,"Kenneth Branagh's towering achievement, ""Hamlet,"" is a bold, richly developed full-length version of one of Shakespeare's most famous plays.Using an international cast of some of today's most popular and best actors, Branagh wastes no time or a single line. Adding color and power to many oft-repeated monologues, he sets some of the key scenes in new and intriguing places.Branagh's actors are, for the most part, terrific. Derek Jacobi plays Claudius with skill and intelligence, making us realize he may have been a fine leader under better circumstances; Kate Winslet makes for a moving Ophelia, the doomed lover of Hamlet; Julie Christie is a stronger Gertrude than Glenn Close was; Charlton Heston is impressive as the Player King; and Branagh, himself, is a graceful Hamlet, in both the quiet moments and the more intense ones.The sets and art direction are beautiful, as are the costumes, creating a world of intrigue, secrets, and mysteries.Branagh's pacing flows so well we never stop to think how long the film is (4 hours). This is something rare among movies.The Academy Awards snubbed the movie in the major categories, acknlowledging the art direction, costumes, and the Patrick Doyle score. Branagh recieved a nomination for adapting the play.  Some critics thought this was odd, but actually it is appropriate considering some of the ingenious ways in which the director uses Shakespeare's words with compelling images.This is one of the best films ever made.",Hamlet
112,pdoniger,This Hamlet is not worth the effort.,1,30 July 2001,"As usual, Kenneth Branagh has substituted all-star casting and ""shtick"" for real, in-depth, meaningful interpretation of Shakespeare -- only this time he's done it to one of the greatest icons of Western culture: Shakespeare's complex revenge tragedy, _Hamlet_.Under the guise of an ""uncut"" version of the play (a term that requires interpretation in itself since we don't know exactly how Shakespeare's original was performed; the earliest versions are quite different from one another), Branagh has presented an often miscast, self-indulgent, periodically unclear mess of a film (why is it set in the 19th century?). His choice of actors is often puzzling. For example, the late, great Jack Lemmon is a wonderful actor, but as a mid-70 year old castle guard, he is out of place. So is Gerard Depardieu, who, wonderful though he is, cannot be justified as the spy, Reynaldo (where did a Danish spy acquire a French accent). Finally, Charlton Heston is downright poor as the First Player. Branagh, himself, is a dull and muddy-mettled Hamlet to be sure. His interpretations as both actor and director smack of ""One from column A and one from column B"" thinking.The film is helped only slightly by the fine performances of Richard Briers (Polonius) and Derek Jacobi (an unusually sympathetic Claudius) and the interesting, though poorly directed and photographed Ghost of Brian Blessed.Skip this one and go directly to the Burton stage performance, the BBC version with Derek Jacobi as Hamlet, or the classic Olivier film -- cuts and all; all three are far superior.",Hamlet
113,Carl Halling,The definitive filmic version of the finest play in history.,10,25 December 2001,"It is a measure of Branagh's brilliance as an actor that despite not being a typical ""Hamlet"" in most peoples' minds, he produces the greatest cinematic portrayal of the tormented Dane I have ever witnessed. It is a film that reminds one precisely why Shakespeare is rated so highly. The tragic introspective, philosophical speeches are so suffused with poetic magnificence as to border on the intoxicating.Shakespeare is in my opinion less succesful as a comic writer (I prefer Moliere), and Hamlet's witty speeches are somewhat cloying. All that cutesy-cutesy word play! But the tragic sections are mindboggling rich with literary genius. But let us not forget Branagh's magnificence as a director. He elicits a quite sublime performance from Kate Winslet as Ophelia...and this girl, barely out of her teens, evokes a sorrow so deep in the madness scene as to leave one breathless. She is a jewel, deep and magnetic beyond reason, given her extreme youth, and apparent angelic innocence. And there are other marvellous performances... by some of this country's most treasured actors: Jacobi, Briers, Spall, all brilliant. And if ever there was any doubt that Julie Christie is a great English actress, her Gertrude will dispel it. Branagh's Hamlet is charismatic, but eminently unsympathetic. Sensitive and intelligent, with a tendency towards piety, he chooses nonetheless to obey his baser nature rather than seek a loftier form of justice, and yield to criminal brutality. If earlier films have glamorised Hamlet, Branagh's version sees him for what he is: a potentially righteous man who throws it all away. One of an elite of cinematic masterpieces of the last twenty years, and one of the greatest artistic triumphs of the silver screen, demonstrating just how high an art the cinema can be, when it's in the hands of a master..................",Hamlet
114,tharrington-3,The worst piece of so called film I have ever seen,1,27 February 2008,"Kenneth Branagh has gone far far too over the top for this production. Once again, another person has gone drunk with star power. Over four hours? Ridiculous. Branagh went all the way back to the original texts for some of this dialogue and it is not necessary nor does it add to the movie in any way. The only reason to possibly watch this is for the occasional cameos by decent actors (Gerard Depardieu, Charlton Heston, Rufus Sewell and so on). Branagh has only two modes of acting and it shows considerably. If you have ever seen his King Henry V (which is surprisingly good) or Much Ado About Nothing (also good) then you will recognize both his stentorian monologues and his fast machine gun recitations. Unfortunately these don't match Hamlet's character...who is not a forty year old man. Quite likely, Branagh shot this movie just so he could have a love scene with Kate Winslet. But it still has three and a half hours to go still after that. His interpretation of the character is neither interesting nor even entertaining. Save yourself two and a half hours and watch the old Hamlet. It's the one by Zeffirelli with Mel Gibson. I was forced to watch Branagh's adaptation and personally believe that it is a waste of time, money, and any random thought that might cross your mind as you attempt to watch this so called film.",Hamlet
115,Steek,A great example of Shakespear for the masses!,9,6 September 1999,"Although there has been much criticism of Branagh's ""over the top"" performance and the mixed performances of the ""who's who"" list of famous Hollywood personalities, the bottom line is that this Hamlet is the first I've seen that will truly hold the attention of most movie-goers and bring Shakespeare's greatest play to a mass audience particularly the young. That it does it for over 4 hours in the very superior long version, is truly an accomplishment.      Like Branagh's ""Much Ado about Nothing"", ""Henry V."", and Zefferelli's 1968 version of ""Romeo and Juliet"", modern audiences without a great deal of experience can understand and appreciate the greatest literature in the English language. More, they can relate to it. This, after all, is what Shakespeare himself would have done. Performances are mixed; Branagh is good, but not great in the title role, Julie Christie, who makes Gertrude a truly interesting character, gives her best performance in years, and Derek Jacobi, who was not great some years ago in his own Hamlet, gives the performance of his life as Claudius. The movie is worth seeing for Jacobi alone. This is a must see especially for college and high school students who thought they could not understand Shakespeare. Like the young audiences of ""Romeo and Juliet"", 30 years ago, they will find themselves saying, I've felt like that!",Hamlet
116,obscure105,A fantastic story,10,15 February 2000,"When I first saw the film, I was amazed by the wonderful acting. It was truly a gripping version that I fell in love with again. It was superb. It is absolutely a movie that you have to see more than once. I would surely see it over again myself as I have seen it more than once. Branagh is a great actor as he was in Much Ado About Nothing and Othello. He is one of the best Shakespearean actors of our time. A must see!",Hamlet
117,gcameron,This is the real thing...,8,16 September 2000,"...warts and all.  Whether it be called a ""film"" or a ""filmed play"" is questionable (the fact is that ""Hamlet"" is a long, somewhat ungainly, occasionally redundant play that is in some ways more suited to reading than to viewing all at once), but Branagh's uncut ""Hamlet"" does justice to Shakespeare.  The whole thing is here, and (mostly) very well acted to boot -- and the completeness of the text will render unwatchable such butchered, ""Shakespeare's greatest hits"" versions as the 1991 Zefferelli/Mel Gibson film.It is a travesty that Branagh was not at least nominated for an Oscar for his performance in the title role.  He approaches the scenes as a musician would approach a difficult passage -- controlling his instrument carefully, building up to climaxes upon certain words, deftly combining externalized gestures with inner emotion.  As Ebert has noted, Branagh dares to pull out all the stops in the big moments.  Compared to him, Olivier's respectable performance seems to me rather stiff and recital-like, while Gibson's is like a pop keyboardist tackling Rachmaninov's 3rd Concerto.Even better is Derek Jacobi's magnificent performance as Claudius.  It is the best piece of Shakespearean acting I've ever seen on film, and once of the best performances in any movie.  Watch his monologue in the chapel, or the inner agony he exhibits when asking Britain to bring about ""the present death of Hamlet.""  Given the full text to work with, he restores Claudius from a two-dimensional bad-guy to one of literature's greatest and most complex villains.",Hamlet
118,polaire2005,Brilliant Commentary on the DVD,10,19 August 2007,"I just received the DVD yesterday (I pre-ordered it from Amazon back in the spring) and popped it into my computer. The movie still looks gorgeous and it's wonderful to be able to watch it without commercials and to take breaks. There aren't a whole lot of special features (not surprising given the budget for this kind of project), but the commentary by Branagh and consultant Russell Jackson, an English professor and Shakespeare specialist, is terrific. Be prepared for a short seminar on Shakespeare, acting, and film-making, especially the adaptation of plays into film. And if you're partial to dry British humor, you won't be disappointed.There's also an interesting introduction by Branagh filmed on the occasion of the release of the DVD and a short making-of feature. But the commentary's the thing.The DVD was worth the wait.",Hamlet
119,reach,"Buy it, you'll like it!",9,25 September 1998,"This movie is worth owning both because of Branagh's acting which is very slightly over the top: he's a great actor but a superb director. Both are at their best when they are not simultaneous. This movie, however, is a keeper not just for the superb direction but also because it is full text. All of it. And it is made sense of. I prefer this to Zefferelli's Hamlet even though I think that Gibson's portrayal was much better than Branagh's. (They were trying to do different things with the characters however.) Nonetheless, Zefferelli's direction loses the insights that Shakespeare offers us. Here Branagh does capture the very best of Shakespeare's intent.",Hamlet
120,Mr. Liza,"So good, so long",8,12 March 1999,"Brilliantly filmed--a gorgeously opulent fantasy.  By and large, the acting is quite good, but guest star turns are extremely variable and ultimately distracting.  However, I will insist to my dying day that, when filming Shakespeare, there is no need to capture every single line--even the immortal Bard could've used an editor.",Hamlet
121,alex979,Unique and Excellent Adaptation,8,24 February 2007,"I saw this adaptation of Hamlet in my English class. When I heard that it would be adapted for Edwardian times, I was very skeptical. I didn't know if the legendary tragedy could be made into a Twentieth-Century tale.Must I say that this is a wonderful and well-made version of Hamlet! Kenneth Branagh is outstanding as Hamlet; sometimes I wonder whether he is theatrically trained. Kate Winslet does a fine job as Ophelia; this is one of the movies that shows how great of an actress she is. The rest of the cast provides a good backbone to the story. I was surprised how many well-known actors are in this movie (Even the amazing Dame Judi Dench makes a cameo).I wouldn't say this is one of the best movies I've seen, but the film is very entertaining and very powerful. I highly recommend Hamlet to anyone who is interested in a different approach on Shakespeare.",Hamlet
122,speedgon07,A Cinematic Masterpiece. Kenneth Branagh's Greatest Shakespearean Film.,10,21 August 2007,"The first time I saw this excellent production, it was on VHS (I was too young to see it when it came out in theaters) and was literally blown away by Kenneth Branagh's genius in every aspect of this film. Everything about it was top-notch (I had grown up watching Charlton Heston in ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"" and Robin Williams in ""Aladdin."") I had seen Sir Laurence Olivier's ""Hamlet"" previous to this version and thought it was the work of a master (it's not without reason that he's acclaimed as the greatest Shakespearean actor who ever lived). Zeferelli's chopped-up version starring Mel Gibson isn't crap, but it's not as good as either Branagh or Olivier's film versions. To make a long story short, I was a true fan of Kenneth Branagh after viewing this colossal epic, made in the style of ""The Ten Commandments,"" ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus."" This is the full text of the play, with a few additions by Kenneth Branagh, along with a nice twist or two (which make a lot of sense). MILD SPOILER ALERT: The twist occurs almost at the end of the movie and it involves Osric (Robin Williams).Finally, this full-length version of William Shakespeare's greatest play (arguably with ""Romeo & Juliet,"" ""Othello,"" ""Richard III,"" ""Julius Caesar,"" ""Macbeth"" and ""King Lear"") is out on DVD (and in a well-deserved 2-Disc Special Edition and NOT with the crappy bare-bones presentations that are sometimes given to DVD editions of Shakespeare films). The feature commentary by Kenneth Branagh and Russell Jackson is excellent, as is the 7-minute introduction to the movie by Kenneth Branagh, a 12 minute Cannes promo for the film and the featurette ""To Be On Camera: A History With Hamlet,"" included on Disc 2. Everything is very informative. The DVD also includes trailers of the 1990 and 1996 film versions of ""Hamlet,"" the 1965 and 1995 versions of ""Othello"" and two films included in the ""Shakespeare Collection"" along with the 1965 ""Othello"" and this hypnotic film version of ""Hamlet."" The transfer from VHS to pristine DVD format is as marvelous as the movie itself. Everything is crystal clear in terms of content and image resolution.This movie might scare a lot of people off, as it is 4 hours long, but it never feels that long (more like 2 hours; but I'm always hypnotized by this version, because it is so well done). I am pleased to recommend this version of the Bard's longest and greatest work to everyone who enjoys film and or is a student of Shakespeare. I also highly recommend Olivier's version. Rated PG for some violence.",Hamlet
123,JMcClane02,Amazing!,10,12 April 2005,"Hamlet is by far my favorite of all of Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one heck of an actor. His portrayal of this was just amazing. His soliloquies were breathtaking. For as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest, however I was engrossed in this particular piece. I recommend this to anyone both fan of Shakespeare and those not so much. This has everything the modern world looks for in its films: murder, betrayal, and deceit. Not to knock Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole work. This leaves no stone unturned. When you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself. Um how you say ""two thumbs up"".",Hamlet
124,bondebygatan,Breath-holding Competition,3,16 February 2019,"This film is the equivalent of an uninvolved high school student's enforced read of the script for Shakespeare's Hamlet because each line is followed within less than a second by the next line, and there are no pauses for actually comprehending or considering what is going on.
Furthermore, in scenes where characters are meant to be waiting for something, there is no wait. The thing they were waiting for just happens instantly instead.
There simply isn't any breathing room, and I'm amazed they managed to find this many actors who could hold their breaths for upwards of 4 hours.",Hamlet
125,Vampire,The best telling of Shakespeares greatest tragedy.,9,8 September 1998,"I have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when I saw this film. This film restores the power and art to Hamlet that it was always meant to have. Even those oh-so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the movie. Making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. Where one would expect the dark, gloomy cliched castle, we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself, as it should. Well worth your time, all four hours of it.",Hamlet

I get still amazed every time I watch it and it is not for a moment boring or incomprehensible, although I am not a native speaker. My five-year-old daughter (who doesn't speak a word of English) watched it and could understand what was going on thanks to the excellent performances.

The movie is four hours long, but not one minute in those four hours is boring or superfluous.

His Hamlet is one of the best performances of the character I have seen in a long time. Interestingly enough, one of my favorite Hamlets was Derek Jacobi in the BBC version, and he excellently plays Claudius in this movie version.  All in all, a great movie, a great screenplay, and a great viewing experience.",Hamlet
130,Ferdinand_99,A beautiful adaptation,9,1 April 2015,"Kenneth Branagh makes (or at least used to make) beautiful Shakespeare adaptations. Henry V was a powerful adaptation but i would say that this full, four-hour adaptation of Hamlet is even better. Everything is done with such great eloquence.Hamlet of course is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play about Hamlet, the prince of Denmark (played by Branagh) who believes that his uncle Claudius (Derek Jacobi) murdered his father to become king. Hamlet starts to make plots to get his guilty uncle to confess his foul act while Claudius starts to plot the murder of Hamlet.The thing that i loved about the fact that this film was the full version of Hamlet is that this way all the nuances and social statements weren't left on the cutting room floor. In for example Olivier's version of the story all this is left off and the film feels like a lamer, less powerful version of the story no matter how beautiful that film looks. The dialog is of course Shakespeare's original words and those words feel as powerful and meaningful as ever.And maybe a part of that power in the words is because the lines are performed so well. Kenneth Branagh plays the role of Hamlet with such power and calmness. He reads the lines so beautifully. Derek Jacobi's Claudius feels like an actual character in stead of being a two- dimensional character like in some of the other film adaptations (another advantage of the full four-hour version). Other good performances include ones by Julie Christie, a young Kate Winslet, Richard Briers and Michael Maloney.As good as Branagh's performances is i think the way he directs the film is even more amazing. For a four-hour adaptation of a 16th century play the film is incredibly cinematic. Every single scene is directed with such intensity and power. His attention to detail with the technical aspects of the film is phenomenal. The production design is beautiful as are the costumes. The score is really good and is another one of things i liked about the film.One might ask after all this praise why am i not giving it a 10/10. I'm not sure. Pretty much all the aspects of the film work really well. But i just wasn't perhaps blown away by it enough to give it the highest rating. But it still is a phenomenal film that i recommend very much. It's especially a must see for Shakespeare fans.",Hamlet
131,iaintemperley,Impeccable Shakespeare,8,4 February 2017,"William Shakespeare is indubitably one of the most influential writers of all time. This influence can be felt in all forms of culture or creative mediums; film being one such medium. Many films have directly or indirectly adapted his work to varying degrees of triumph; this film being one of the most accomplished efforts. Regrettably even with near- universal praise (including 4 Oscar nominations) it only produced a fraction of its budget at the box office. What sets this apart from other interpretations of perhaps Shakespeares finest play is that it is unabridged: unlike others where parts or sections have to be cut to make it more cinematically acceptable, every single line and direction is present here (not always in order though). Given the 4 hour running time you wouldn't be criticised for thinking it would turn out to be an utter bore: this is when Branaghs love and superb direction comes in. The decision to change the setting from the 13th to 19th century results in some unashamedly beautiful staging which, when married with such irreproachable source material, creates an admirable work that makes those 4 hours fly by. Oh, and the cast is a roll-call of names that would make most Hollywood directors green with envy.",Hamlet
132,sakharovaav,Branagh is a good actor but bad director,7,25 February 2021,"I like that this version trusts Shakespeare, I mean: it is full. For example, such character as Fortinbras is not deleted as in many other adaptations - the guy who, after everyone in Elsinore killed each other, is going to be elected as the Danish king. Because among other things, Hamlet is a story of the power change.The viewer who survives all the 4 hours of monologues and dialogues can feel how it was in the Shakespeare's theatre.However, my impression is that Branagh as a director does not know what to do with some lines (and some characters like Horatio). While the other showrunners cut away many fragments to make Hamlet a trite romantic boy, he merely saturates the movie with sex, violence, noise, hysteria, etc.Sometimes it works well when it doesn't contradict the plot. Really, Shakespeare's tragedy is not a 12+ fairy tail. To Be or not to Be is clever here: he speaks about the bodkin and frightens eavesdroppers with it. Bingo.Sometimes this kaboom looks amusing but senseless, as in the very first scene when one guardian shouting madly falls on the other. Why using fireworks in the scene with the ghost? Why making Ofelia a woman of easy virtue from the very beginning? And so on.So, for me the movie looks like a combination of better and worse scenes.",Hamlet
133,Gobble-2,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time,10,3 January 1999,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it.  My view on the movie may be partially biased since I had never read the play before, but I got pulled into this movie's grasp.  Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements.But now on to the movie...I found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus, were able to articulate it quite well.  Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King.  The thing I liked about this was that it worked very well as a ""MOVIE"" and not as a play you are studying.  You don't need to be affluent with Shakespeare to relate to all the Misery hamlet has to go through.  I would recommend this movie to a wide audience.That's my two cents.",Hamlet
134,Roelof Ruules,Branagh or Shakespeare?,10,8 October 2000,"This is one of the greatest performances I ever saw.  But is it Shakespeare?Other commentators hint on Shakespeare's intentions.  The fact is: there are none.  The text (as any Shakespeare text) does not give much more than sparse directions.  Most, if not all, is left to the director's fantasy. Is Hamlet a dark brooding character?  Shakespeare never said so, nor anything to the contrary.  It's all in the performer's mind, the viewer's mind, the reader's mind; in the end, it's all down to interpretation.  Over the years, Hamlet has been played as a stubborn ruler-to-be, a worrying youth, a psychological case, and so on.  There's no telling what Shakespeare intended, and there's no way, either, to know how he would have it performed.There are no stage directions.  Some authors produce more hints than lines, and Shakespeare is not among them.  Hamlet is set in Denmark, but it is a Denmark that never existed.  It might be a trick, to be able to comment on the actual England, or it might simply be any setting that would do. Again, there's no telling as Shakespeare himself never had anything to write on it (he might have had something to say, but nobody took the trouble to record it).  Hence, directors over time were at liberty.  And thus, Hamlet was performed at a medieval castle, any contemporary place of power, or simply a stage with nothing more than a few props.  Richard Loncraine set Richard III in a would-be pre-war fascist England, and never the worse for the dialogues.  We simply don't know what Shakespeare really wanted.What we do know is that Hamlet contains much of everything: philosophy, action, wit, contemplation.  So does Branagh's adaptation.  There is criticism on the cameos.  Actually, it has been suggested that Polonius' line ""I did enact Julius Caesar"" (act III, scene 2) simply was written for the actor performing as the Roman general in an earlier stage production of the play by that name, as an in-joke for the contemporary public.  So much for Shakespeare.Seeing this film, I was never bored, I had laughs, and, actually, was moved at times.  Given that the actors kept to the original lines, there are not many plays that could achieve that, in any adaptation.  This one did.",Hamlet
135,Quiz Kid,a truly fantastic film,10,29 March 2000,"To say that this is a good Hamlet adaptation is to understate just how good a movie this is.  Kenneth Branagh truly flexes revolutionary filmmaking muscles with the aid of wonderful D.P. and a truly Shakespearian cast.  He indeed makes this story his, and in doing so, justifies the ego of a perfectionist who's in love with ""Hamlet"".The plot itself, as are all the really good ones, is basic and eternal. Much like the tales of Jesus Christ or (not to overemphasize or de-emphasize the latter or the former) the film ""The Godfather"", the story unravels like so:  the unassuming son of a great legend is forced to take uncharacteristic action due to the evils of the world, eventually proving to everyone that he is truly his father's son.  Whether it be Jesus, Michael Corleone, or young Hamlet, this powerful device tends to work very well.  Although William Shakespeare may not have been the first to make it work, one would be hard pressed to argue that it is ""Hamlet"" that makes it work the best.
So, to those who do not know the story and are wondering about what I'm babbling about, it goes like this:  King Hamlet, the beloved, respected, feared king of Denmark is killed one day while napping in his chambers by his jealous brother Claudius.  Two months after he is killed, Claudius marries Hamlet's wife, Gertrude.  After this has happened, the young Hamlet, prince of Denmark returns home from school in Wittenburg to find his mother married to his slimy uncle, who is now the fully appointed King.  Hamlet is not a happy boy.  He doesn't respect his mother, he doesn't trust his uncle, and he can't stand the smell of things.  The Ghost of King Hamlet tells Hamlet one evening what happened to him, and gives young Hamlet the unenviable task of righting the wrongs of his unceremonious death.  He demands that Hamlet avenge his death, he demands Hamlet kill Claudius.  But Hamlet is not a violent person.  He may have a hotheaded temper at times, but it isn't within him to kill.  Or so he thinks.  The story of Hamlet is filled with tragedy, drama, a little comedy, and a lot of murder.  But Branagh's interpretation transcends everything except the basic idea that ordinary people can do insane, illogical, heroic things when placed in extra-ordinary circumstances.Style-wise, it doesn't get much better.  Choosing 18th century England as the backdrop, everything from the spooky prologue to the last, violent exeunt is done in such a manner that suggests precise intensity.  The director knows how to convey the pinpointed flaws in every situation (Hamlet's judgemental stance the first time we see him says so much), always letting the characters' demons hang out there, because he knows that the movie and audience will benefit from it.This is a truly fantastic film, adaption or not.  If you are an aspiring director with a love for original, weird, or otherwise interesting shots, watch this for that alone.****",Hamlet
136,williamspeter-00945,As good as a direct Shakespeare adaptation can get,7,1 August 2020,"This movie does everything it can to bring Shakespeare's work to life in the new medium. The story is presented unabridged, but with cinematic flair: the production and costume design are top notch, the music compliments it excellently and the calibre of actor is unparalleled (Kenneth Branagh and Derek Jacobi in particular impressed me). And flair really is the word for this film. A sense of bombast is brought to it, which we rarely see in Shakespeare adaptations: usually these works are treated as high are which cannot be degraded through extravagence, but here we see the Earth cracking open, we have massive armies, we have extravagent fight scenes. This really brings a sense of life to the material that makes it fly by (especially for a four-hour movie).So maybe you find it strange that it's still only an 8/10. Well, as far as I'm concerned an unabridged adaptation of a Shakespeare play can't really beat that. This film inherits the typical mishaps of his work: people behave out-of-character to contrive the necessary plot developments, vital plot elements take place off screen (including a central character's death!), the climax feels annoyingly unclimactic and so on. To make a truly excellent Shakespeare adaptation, one would have to take liberties with the plot and this film goes out of its way to alter as little as possible from the original script.(I know some people find this kind of talk about Shakespeare unthinkable, but come on, let's stop treating him like a god; he was a writer with flaws like any other. And he wrote four hundred years ago; storytelling has come a long way since then. It's no slight against him to say that his works don't hold up perfectly hundreds of years later.)That being said, for what it is, it is a triumph: brilliantly performed and with a great style, an epic in every sense of the word.",Hamlet
137,tbone_4ever,Brilliant version,10,5 February 2005,"I must say that, looking at Hamlet from the perspective of a student, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded. It helps the play come to life on screen, and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text.One of the things I have heard criticized many times is the casting of major Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare.Also, his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text. Such as how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it.",Hamlet
138,prophetess_mar,Stick to directing,3,7 March 2007,"Branagh may be a good person but he is just not an exceptional actor. He is a little to flamboyant and lacking in subtlety and depth. The range of emotions that Branagh displays are largely based on the volume of his voice. Intense? he is, histrionic? he is, but you get the idea. Good acting entails more. This is hardly the complexity that we'd expect from a Hamlet or a Henry V (see my review of Henry V) Not to attack the poor guy, he actually did a great job in Much Ado, because his character was supposed to BE a little flamboyant. If you are looking for great acting, go for the BBC collection of Shakespeare's works. Otherwise I suppose this version is just fine.",Hamlet
139,ellysbelly,"the best of all ""Hamlet"" adaptations",10,18 October 2005,"""Hamlet"" is a play to be read and watched as long as man lives. and among the adaptations of the greatest play of Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh's is truly a masterpiece. the difference between the other adaptations, Branagh's Hamlet is more colorful, and it uses the full, original text of the play, apart from the time it takes place. thus, it is very useful for literature students in that sense. Kenneth Branagh as hamlet, especially when he screams out ""I loved Ophelia!"", is fascinating, not to mention the rest of the cast. in short, it is the best ""Hamlet"" adaptation with its respect for the original text. any special scenes? the whole movie is a special scene!",Hamlet
140,Mahler,Where are the Oscars?,10,27 November 1998,"I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs.  I figured 4 hours would be great, I've been a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, Henry V.  I was completely overwhelmed by the direction, acting, cinematography that this film captured.  Like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly.  Branagh doesn't play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this.  When I watch this film I'm constantly trying to find faults, I've looked at the goofs and haven't noticed them.  How he was able to move the camera in and out of the Hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me.  This movie was shot in 70 mil. It's a shame that Columbia hasn't released a Widescreen version of this on VHS.  I own a DVD player, and I'd take this over Titanic any day.  So Columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched! And I don't know what happened at the Oscars.  This should have swept Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Direction, best cinematography.  What films were they watching?  I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he did a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen.  They should have been giving a tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.",Hamlet
141,DoctorJayTrotter,"A feast for the eyes, but too drawn out",9,4 January 1999,"Branagh does a wonderful job with Shakespeare's Hamlet, but in his own unique way. The change to a later time period and the setting of an indescribably luxurious castle are both very welcome changes that create an interestingly different mood. And Branagh's portrayal of Hamlet is excellent. Gone is the quiet and gloomy Hamlet; here we are presented with a loud, disruptive, scene-making madman. One minute he's sadly calm and the next he becomes sarcastically violent. However, on the down side, the movie is far too long. I expect that 90% of people will find it too difficult to finish. In addition there is a running theme of inappropriate cameos, most notably Jack Lemmon and Robin Williams. What are comedians doing in a tragedy? Lemmon's voice is totally out of place and Williams doesn't fit particularly because some of his best stand-up work involved making fun of Shakespeare. In short, this production is certainly a gem, but for most viewers 1990's Hamlet starring Mel Gibson is much more accessible. Neither one is better, they're just different, despite what artsy fartsy types may say.",Hamlet
142,drugal97,This was an excellent movie that shouldn't be missed.,10,7 January 1999,Kenneth Branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of Shakespeare's most classic and well-written tragedy. Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears. Kate Winslet's performance is also of great note.,Hamlet
143,Becky-42,Victorian update--BAD IDEA,2,26 June 1999,"The redeeming quality to this version of Hamlet (in my eyes)is the fact that it stays true to the original length and order of the play by Shakespeare. More filmmakers should try this, especially with Shakespeare (who is one of the obvious geniuses of the millennium). It would make sense, since Branagh supposedly cares about staying true to the original, to set it in the time it was meant to be set in, NOT the Victorian era, which Shakespeare never even saw.  It is garish and much too bright, especially when the overacting and needless action is added. The dialogue should take center stage in many scenes (especially the last one).Because of this, I prefer both the Laurence Olivier and the Zeffirelli version of Hamlet, which takes advantage of dark and spare castle rooms and the countryside where Ophelia spends her last hours.",Hamlet
144,samuelttidd,Incredible performances meddled by horrible directing,5,25 March 2019,"Looking at the star-studded ensemble and budget of 18 million, not to mention the infamously rich base material, you expect Kenneth Branagh to deliver a tour de force-or at least something enjoyable. Instead, Hamlet is an incoherent wash of good performances riddled with hilariously blocking and pacing that can make you actually laugh out loud.
With the resources available, it is disappointing to see the lack of effort that went into directing and editing the film. Cast and abundant money nonetheless, it doesn't do the material justice, and even worse, isn't enjoyable.",Hamlet
145,TarasY,"Timeless plot, wonderfully executed",10,11 November 2001,"Branagh really pulled out all the stops for this version of Hamlet. Set in what seems to be the mid-19th century, the direction shines through, and the star-studded cast doesn't detract from the intense story. Branagh is by far the best actor here, and overall, the film (despite being extremely long) manages to convey both the plot, and the underlying themes, very clearly and not without sufficient action to give it a feel of continuous movement. Recommended.",Hamlet
146,HLYWoodStarlett,Best movie ever made!,10,13 February 2002,"Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is absolutely positively exquisite. Everything about it captures the essence of Shakespeare. Though it is four hours long, one can hardly tell because the presentation is so heart felt. At the end of the four hours, you actually wish that there was more!! The length is much outweighed by the beauty and quality. Branagh's role as director results in pure art-the beautiful colors, the setting, everything about it. Branagh's performance as the tormented Hamlet captures the feeling and the emotions of the character better than any other film version of the Shakespeare play. His acting is beautiful and superb, and this film should give him the title of ""best actor in the history of acting"".",Hamlet
147,annoying_goit,Not What I was Expecting...,7,6 October 2004,"Still being of school age, and having to learn Shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go. However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. This production of Hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies I have seen in a long time- and it really brings to life what I expect Shakespeare wanted his plays to be like (well, with the difference that this is cinema) much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could. The story is good, the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring (though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to Shakespeare's language) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect; mainly, perhaps, due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be, even in such small parts, but it is Robin Williams as Osric and Billy Crystal as the Gravedigger who really stand out, giving such minor parts an unexpected zest, as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy.The main stars, of course, are also wonderful. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good, but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.The set pieces, too, are often quite stunning, giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in Shakespeare productions, as well as a real sense of the country around them.Of course, the movie, taken as a movie in its own right, is not without faults, but no major ones (the pacing is the only real problem I can think of offhand, as well as the prose for anyone not used to, as I said, Shakesperean language) and, especially when compared to the sort of Shakespeare productions I'm used to seeing in class, it really is quite brilliant. It's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on Shakespeare, that his plays are boring (I came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring, merely the teachers who recite them in class). If only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one, English students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the Bard.Overall 7/10",Hamlet
148,MapleRose,A bit too over the top,6,31 January 2005,"This movie is not bad for a study on the play as the scenes follow the order in the original play. However, I feel that it is too close to the play and too over the top. Branagh put almost every single line that Shakespeare wrote into the film, which makes it difficult to understand. As Hamlet, Branagh tries too much to stick to the pentameter, making his speeches sound unnatural, like he's reciting something instead of talking. I like the way the difficult lines are cut out in the Mel Gibson version.I also find that Hamlet is a bit too emotional (cries too much). I do understand that given his situation, he would be a bit unstable. But Branagh did his emotions a bit too much.The ghost scene is over the top. So is the scene when he's yelling at Ophelia. I like the idea of the one-sided mirror, but he shouldn't have shot the scene from the glass side. The scene is not supposed to be funny, but it's hard to resist laughing at the shot of Ophelia's face squashed against the glass.I think Hamlet is a bit too old. I imagine him to be in his twenties, not thirty to forty. His goatee is a bit unnecessary, so is his white-blonde hair that makes him even older. Claudius looks too nice to be a scheming rat who's always drunk. He looks like he could be a Santa Claus.I do like the fact that they changed the time to more modern style, and the costumes and the set are well done--correct to the time period and eye-pleasing. I also like the fact that they played out the scenes when someone reference to a scene not in the play (like the murder, the love scene), so that it's easier to visualize. As for the love scene, no, Shakespeare never said that there ever was something that close between Hamlet and Ophelia, that's the director's interpretation, which is fine. It makes it that it would be even harder for either of them to accept the ""break-up"".Overall, it's a good film to watch for studying the play, but not too great as entertainment.",Hamlet
149,mymovie-1,Great acting,9,8 June 2006,"I thought Kenneth Branagh was amazing in this film. I thought he really understood the role and proved himself as an actor. I hate to say it but the only weak acting job was done by Jack Lemmon. I have seen many versions of this film and I felt that Branagh took it by the horns and ran with it. Even if your not a lover of Shakespeare, this movie handles the content beautifully. Great Music, great acting, good directing, nice cinematography. It pretty much has it all covered. I have seen the movie at least 4 times. I finally asked my 13 year old son to watch it with me. I thought he would find it ""boring"", but he did not. He thought it was truly a great movie and he still talks about it. This movie moves, there is always something happening and you get sucked into this great story of Hamlet.The movie is finally coming out on DVD. I will certainly add it to my collection.",Hamlet

His father visits him as a ghost several times, however no one else can see him. Before he can officially overcome the death he brings it to life to show others what has actually happened. This will definitely take you on an emotional rollercoaster. I gave this an 8 out of 10 star rating, because although the play and book come together there's no purpose.

The acting was what was carrying the movie, all of the lines were well delivered and emotion put behind the lines that needed it.

This adaptation depicts the tragedy of young Hamlet with many new inspiring takes on Shakespear's original play. Having Kenneth Branagh playing the roles of both the director and taking on the main role of Hamlet, allows a perfect depiction of the character to be conveyed by himself exactly like he wanted Hamlet to be portrayed. This portrayal shows the deep emotions and thoughts of Hamlet giving the movie a more adult atmosphere, as younger viewers may not understand the meaning or interpretations as clearly. I do believe that this movie did a good job at keeping true to the story and plot of Hamlet, whilst still adding extra chaos and effects to improve the viewing experience. The great acting of Kenneth Branagh and the directional decisions he took to design this movie adaptation are two of the many reasons I found this piece entertaining to watch. I feel that his interpretation of Hamlet and small personal changes to the film from the original work helped create Shakespear's work to be visually expressed. This kept the movie both entertaining and exciting to watch, while keeping the same dramatic tragedy. I could not possible recommend this adaptation of Hamlet more than I already am as this was a wonderful film to watch and I hope whoever reads this review watches it too.",Hamlet

There's so much to say about this visual masterpiece, Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Charlton Heston. It has such a huge cast, and i can understand why all these actors wanted to be part of this film, come to think of it, i don't blame them, lol. This is my favorite hamlet adaptation, the director sees the tragedy in a beautiful way, and not all darkness and chaos. Kate Winslet was great, too. One of her first 5 films.

I felt that all of the actors were excellently cast, and I felt that Kenneth Branagh himself brought a lot of personal feeling into the character of Hamlet. I was initially surprised to see Kate Winslet as Ophelia, but I thought she did a very good job.

I regret I have to be a voice of dissension with regard to Mr. Branagh's performance.This is really a glorious, sumptuous film, to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designed. Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers, and many others do fine jobs. Then there's Kenneth Branagh. If ever there was a vanity project for an actor, this is it, and Mr. Branagh spares nothing in putting the ""ham"" in Hamlet. From the stunt casting (which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast Jack Lemmon), to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of ""naturalness,"" to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others. His performance confirms that, while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary, he has never been a great film actor. The scenery budget could be charged to catering, Mr. Branagh eats so much of it. His performance is a perfect example of why people don't go to see Shakespeare - ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" And if there is fault to his direction, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.No matter what theories people may posit on the Bard, he was, after all is said and done, a playwright. The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. Although there is no ""right"" way to play his plays, there is most certainly great acting, good acting and bad acting. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of ""Hamlet"" itself. It amazes me how Mr. Branagh ""mouthed"" it, but did not hear it. It was an example of spending too much time working out how he's going to say something, and too little figuring out WHAT he's saying.While Mr. Branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions, he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it. His direction has always been better than his acting. I still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming Shakespeare. He set a great template for other productions. And, it would be interesting to see him onstage, from about 20 rows back. But, I do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.Is it worth seeing? Certainly. There are many little joys to be found in the film. But, it's a long, long movie and, by the end, one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it.",Hamlet

Every other version of the play I've seen--live or on film--has Hamlet as a vacillating, nervous, unsure young man...and as an English major, I saw quite a few. Branagh makes clear from the very beginning that his Hamlet is aware of the treachery that has been perpetrated, was a fairly clear plan about what to do, and has minimal if any self-doubt. In fact, he manipulates many of the other characters around him. I've never seen such a motivated, confident Hamlet. What an unusual--and successful--re-imagining of the character!

170,jleo2525,Great adaptation of Hamlet with one glaringly obvious exception.,8,22 November 2009,"One of the best things about this adaptation is that it uses the full text of the play, uncondensed, and unapologetically (...and Derek Jacobi). There are a few discrepancies between the setting and intended historical atmosphere between Kenneth Branagh's adap and the original, and some of the historical references about Wittenburg and the English tribute to Denmark thus lose significance, but Shakespeare had his own anachronistic style, and Branagh's isn't gapingly obvious here.The casting was superb for the most part. The only obvious exception was Jack Lemmon (much too old and senile to be Marcellus).If I have one bad thing to say about this movie, it'd have to be about the over-acted, incomprehensibly quirky, and obviously unbalanced interpretation of Hamlet himself by Branagh. The ideal Hamlet would be your typical bi-polar.. the mania would have to be weighed against some form of dejection. Branagh shows himself to be entirely incapable of the latter. He somehow finds a way to transform despair into anger, triumph, and other constructive attitudes every time--reversing the intention of the text and making himself seem ludicrous (very anti-climactic for the play as a whole). In his favor, he does seem to have great on-screen chemistry with Winslet (Ophelia).Derek Jacobi embodies King Claudius and makes up for Branagh entirely. Watch this movie if only for him.",Hamlet
171,adriane_renee,**** out of 4,10,26 April 2003,"This movie is absolutely brilliant. Kenneth Branagh turns in yet another amazing performance in a picture that seems to have been overlooked by some, but should be remembered for ages to come. It is a classic. The movie starts on a slow but intriguing journey that grasps your attention. The tragic story of Hamlet's (Kenneth Branagh) discovery of how exactly his father died, the betrayal of family, the lust of two lovers yearning to be together, yet everyone thinking Hamlet is insane destroys the chance of Ophelia (Kate Winslet) and Hamlet ever having a life together. For there are dark things going on between the family, revenge, murders being planned. The performances turned in are nothing less than perfect. Branagh is the perfect Hamlet, capturing his madness, insanity, and love for Ophelia marvelously. Winslet is the only person who could play Ophelia, (it's only a shame that she shall forever be known as 'the girl from 'Titanic', because she is an amazing actress). Julie Christie turns in another great performance making us hate her at times (like turning on her son), but love her always. Derek Jacobi as Claudius shows just how great of an actor he is by making us hate him, but does it so well. In addition, Nicholas Farrell gives a performance not to be forgotten as Horatio. The story unfolds beautifully. Branagh can really capture the beauty and sole of Shakespeare, like no other can. He brings these stories to a whole new generation, and that needs to be done. How he is able to turn these stunning plays in stunning pictures is anyone's guess; but however he does it, I hope he keeps it up. **** out of 4",Hamlet
172,lepower,Branagh is the best Hamlet I have ever seen.,10,20 May 2003,"Branagh, as usual, puts the vigor back into Shakespeare, and his is the most vivid Hamlet I've ever seen.  He also uses often-omitted scenes to great effect;  in fact the emotional turning point of the film comes during a scene (with Robin Williams as Osrick) that is almost never staged.Fantastic cameos by Williams, Billy Christal and Rufus Sewell, as well as the great Judi Dench in a silent scene.  Brian Blessed is a monumental ghost, with more life to him than most of the Hamlets I've seen!",Hamlet
173,idealistinblue,A Hamlet Devoid of Poetry,5,19 November 2007,"A warped and bloated production that bears little resemblance to the Bard's masterpiece. The production seems to be the result of a hodgepodge of influences and designs. One imagines Branagh chatting with his associates about potential gimmicks to incorporate in the film and then willy-nilly including them all with no overarching vision to guide his choices.One much-vaunted ""advantage"" of this production is that it is virtually ""uncut"" from Shakespeare's original. Given the length of the barely adapted script, the characters are forced to speak at a fast clip that robs the lines of their power and sometimes of their sense. To compensate, the unpoetic Branagh films explanatory scenes to intersperse with their machine-gun fire speeches. He thus unpoetically replaces rich, lyrical ambiguity with defined, visual sequences---a travesty.He takes this unpoetic principle to incredible extremes. Branagh's Hamlet doesn't love Ophelia with a despairing passion betrayed only by a few, haunted words. Branagh destroys any mystery or sexual tension in the relationship by filming the pair actually having sex. As drama professors are wont to say, Shakespeare knows well that nothing destroys sexual tension as quickly as a view of the actual sex act. We don't fall in love with Romeo because he manipulates his sex organs on the stage; it is the fiery passion of his words that seduces us, but Branagh-the-director has no affinity for words.There are many fine actors in this production but their performances are small orphans in the middle of a riotous crowd. Talented as they are, they cannot compensate for the director's lack of vision, lack of affinity for the text and confusion of dramatic devices.Other nontraditional adaptations work very well, indeed. The inventive Campbell Scott version filmed for television (on a much smaller budget) employs a largely American cast and a relatively modern setting but the anachronisms in no way detract from the drama. In the Scott version the music, sets and costumes retain the somber mood one associates with the play, without overwhelming the actors and still leaving room for humor. In the Branagh version the garish sets, overdone lighting and inappropriate music are so intrusive and distracting that there is very little room for the beauty of Shakespeare's poetry. Moreover, the scenes jump raggedly from one mood to another with no coherence of effect. It feels as if one has wandered into an expensive Hollywood psych ward in which the ""characters"" one encounters have a fixation on Shakespeare's words but need another dose of medication before their mouthings become intelligible. Again, this is not the actors' fault---the fault lies with the director.Indeed, one sees flashes of real talent in Branagh's acting, but Branagh-the-director reduces Branagh-the-actor (along with all the other actors) to insignificance.",Hamlet
174,FLaskowski,Just to put something right ...,10,4 April 2004,"(Sorry for my faulty language, i am no native speaker ...)Yes, this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction. Personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around. But i won't use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here. Because those ""perfect! the one-and-only! best-ever!""-reviews make some people turn away (including me).So if you are looking for another 'Hamlet' that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones - Then don't miss this one, if you happen to find it anywhere. (Unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it. It seems there is no DVD out there, and the German language version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format.)Just in case you decide to get a copy: Spare out that cut down two hours (or so) version of this movie.

And its also crippled down to 4:3 aspect ratio.Greetings from Germany, F.L.",Hamlet
175,ronanpaterson,Something of an ordeal,4,3 August 2016,"This overblown, buttock-numbing marathon has been made specifically in a manner to appeal to American financiers. More stuffed with stars than a fois gras goose, the casting unbalances the film. The first half an hour, where Jack Lemmon acts everyone else off the screen, becomes a film about an old soldier whose old boss has died. To have Gerard Depardieu as a virtual walk-on unbalances the film. To have John Mills and John Geilgud in tiny parts is crazy, providing constant distractions. But it no doubt helped to raise the enormous budget required for this 70mm flop.The release of the film was doomed from the start. Branagh's previous successes had come with narrow release art house movies which gradually built up an audience through the word-of-mouth of opinion formers who saw them early on. But to release a four and a half hour version of Hamlet in 70mm meant that only the biggest cinemas could take the movie, and in the multiplexes it came out against Independence Day and Mission Impossible:2. The art house audience were never going to fill the huge cinemas required for the 70mm. Whereas Much Ado About Nothing, his previous Shakespeare film, had made a $20m profit, Hamlet proceeded to lose $20m.The play is supposedly the full, uncut text of Hamlet, but of course this involves editing together several versions of the play, it lasts a very, very long time , which also meant that it was difficult to programme into cinemas, and it all looks rather hubristic. There are very good moments, but the whole film spends so much time and effort trying to look gorgeous to demonstrate where the money went that it gets in the way of the story. There are some excruciating bits, and watching Fortinbras' soldiers in their stovepipe shakoes swinging through windows on ropes like the SAS is just downright silly.Branagh is a major force in filmed Shakespeare, but this is far from his best. The most appropriate response comes in the Blackadder Christmas special of a few years ago, where Edmund, travelling through time, sees Shakespeare and punches him in the face, saying ""that's from every schoolboy who's had to sit through four and a half hours of Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet""For a really good film of Hamlet watch Grigori Kozintsev's Russian film (1964), which is infinitely better.",Hamlet
176,pass6,"My favorite movie; at last a Hamlet that ""CAN make his mind"" :)",10,20 October 2004,"The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got the comedy role of Osiric, otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production. It is really great that Kenneth decided to use the fullest version of the text, this happens definitely not too often... Thanks to that the viewers can see the whole, not the chosen - by the director - parts. Also - thank God that the film is in a classical form; NO to surrealistic fanfaberies ! Although ""Tytus Andronicus"" was impressive nevertheless, but still Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view.",Hamlet

Kenneth is a brilliant actor and cute too. Kenneth's act was wonderful as well as the other characters. The passion and accuracy of this movie was educational. I liked the scenes that showed what was going on while characters tell a story. I would give it a 10, but due to not having a scenery and customes like it should have been, it loses a point giving it a 9. Even the actor who played the Queen should have been a young man like they used to do it, not a woman. OVERALL, this movie is awesome if you want to know exactly what happens in the play and hear word for word. If not, then just watch Gibson's version since it's for pure entertainment.",Hamlet

He update the play in the 19th century and it was a good idea (why not ? Luhrmann did it with his great ""Romeo + Juliet""). It's kinda sad that it wasn't a success at the box office. I'm not a ""cinema lover"" neither Cameron/Michael Bay's biggest fan but I really didn't expect to see such a masterpiece. The only moment that didn't respond to my expectations was the last part of the film when the duel with Hamlet and Laerte start: their costume were too ""effeminate"" (it's an euphemism), even George Michael would be shocked, it was too extravagant(I'm just kidding about G.M.): a sleeveless shirt with overalls, why ?",Hamlet

The Elizabethian English was a struggle to code switch while watching the movie. Watching the movie gave me a better visual that reading it. Even though I didn't enjoy the ending because it happened all too fast. It was overall a good film. I would re watch it to catch anything that I may have missed during the end.

But the overall movie was pretty good! I would watch it again any time. Anyone who's actually interested in Shakespearean novels or movies should really consider watching and/or reading hamlet.

His father had only been dead for 2 months and Hamlet is very suspicious about whats going on. Hamlet best friend Hartio and the other soldiers seen this ghost whom was in armor like he was fighting in war and the believed that it was King Hamlet his self. While in war with Fortinbras Hamlet did not know that King Claudius was sending letters to Fortinbras about land. Hamlet is very sarcastic and very smart.

Another thing I did not a lot this movie was the ending everything was UN fair I think there should have been an little more actions in there. the cheaters played in this good some where a little dumb but it was okay. this movie was way to long but they made it work they did a very good god talking in the Elizabethan,Hamlet
183,davide-richardson,Please beget a temperance that may give it smoothness,5,25 October 2014,"Hamlet: ""Speak the speech, I pray you, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing Termagant. Pray you avoid it"". The really, really epically BAD: Hearing Kenneth Branagh speak these lines as Hamlet to the player is an accidentally comical ironic turn; as what Hamlet would have a fellow whipped for is exactly what Branagh does. I had a strong appreciation for Branagh before seeing him as Hamlet; now I cannot shake the pomposity of this performance. This pomposity worked well when he played Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but for Hamlet...not so much. Branagh accelerates from zero to 300 miles per hour in a second in almost all of his dialog. WHEN Branagh remembers to take his time his restraint gives the dialog force and meaning. His instantaneous shift to screaming at 300 miles an hour shatters the beauty of the dialog. Hamlet beseeches, ""for in the very torrent,tempest, and whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness"". There is no temperance nor smoothness. Additionally, besides being far to old,Branagh's Hamlet seems like a spoiled brat. He doesn't seem like someone who could lead an army or rule a country. He certainly doesn't seem like someone one would bet on in a fencing dual. I'm no fighter, but I felt like I could kick is ass, and at times wanted to.From a directorial perspective, Branagh answering the question of ""did or did not Hamlet and Ophelia have sex"" totally ruined the complexity of that whole element of the play.The regular bad to mediocre: Many of the other performances are mediocre or worse, but pale in comparison to Branagh. The set and setting seemed garish and far too bright. Wonderfully filmed; but as over the top as Branagh's performance. It often made the actors seem tiny. I am a fan of Brian Blessed, and think he did a fine job as the Ghost of Hamlet's Father, but when he first makes himself known to Hamlet and Hamlet is compelling Horatio and Marcellus to ""swear by his sword"" the ground is exploding around them. Also, Hamlet has a wimpy little sword that looks like a $10 toy, which he kisses at one point. Later, he is playing with letter opener that is supposed to be a dagger. Insert your own Shakespearian phallic jokes here. The Good: Doing the whole play. The subtleties of the relationships and politics of the play require seeing at least most of it. Some suggest that the movie is too long. I think it should have been made longer by letting the actors take their time and give the dialog its due. If you are going to have a movie 4 hours long, you may as well go more than 4 hours to get it right. It would have likely required breaking the play into 2 movies, perhaps shot at once and released within 6 months or a year of each other. Sort of how the Lord of Rings trilogy was produced. I appreciate the difficulty of making a movie longer than 2 hours from a business point of view. I will watch this movie in the future, just so I can see the whole play.Derek Jacobi was amazing as Claudius; no other performance in this film compares. I never found Claudius an interesting character before this performance.Kate Winslet as Ophelia was very good. I loved Charlton Heston as the Player. Nicholas Farrell as Horatio was excellent. Timothy Spall and Reece Dinsdale did a nice job as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.For reference: I have read the play at least 6 times. I am not a big Mel Gibson fan, but I do wish Franco Zeffirelli would have made his 1990 version of Hamlet with Mel Gibson the compete play. Maybe release the version he did and a complete version; but alas it is not to be so. I have watched the Laurence Olivier version once, the Kenneth Branagh version 3 times, the Franco Zeffirelli version 5 or 6 times. I have watched the ""definitive version"" of Hamlet; which is Tom Stoppard's ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" dozens of times.",Hamlet

Watching this movie is a painless(nay,the extreme opposite) way of upping your familiarity with the Bard, and impressing the world in g. with the ease you quote from HAMLET. (Kate Winslet is also stunning- so go ahead, be shallow, and choose the movie for its looks) Derek Jacobi masterfully fills the role of Hamlets uncle- he's friendly and suave at the start, and penitent and malicious at the end- And Ken Branaugh (though he may be a tad too peroxide) convinces all when he vows love, revenge, and friendship.

While everyone was sleeping (because they are all total losers and have no appreciation for anything beauteous unless it's on MTV or US Weekly), I was falling in love with another movie. The casting of Ophelia was great because Kate Winslet is my home girl ever since I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. She really plays ""a crazy"" well. I LOVE HAMLET.

186,shrikeangel,Its virtues outweigh its defects,8,12 September 2005,"First, what I didn't like. The acting was not really up to the Hamlet standard. Branagh was really over-the-top, doing a lot of yelling mostly. In my opinion, those actors who were not big-name celebrities generally did a better job; though I would except Billy Crystal and Robin Williams. (And Charlton Heston, too, but I wasn't sure if he was playing at being a hack.) A lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks.What I think speaks very much in this play's favor is that it is accessible. Shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays; many people are not even inclined to try, because of its reputation as Serious Literature and its archaic English. If they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man's interpretation of the play. They will be seeing it more as Shakespeare's audiences saw it: a play with sword fights and battles, and mighty kings and nobles, murder and incest and evil schemes and ghosts--and great art, if one cares to look for it, but in Shakespeare's day most didn't, any more than most people do now. Branagh's overacting, and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer, may detract from Shakespeare's art somewhat, but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it, rather than nothing.I've got to say one more thing though. Some people are complaining that ""it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't Shakespeare's time"". Well, in Shakespeare's time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays. Shakespeare may have SAID it's in the days of ancient Rome or medieval Denmark or whatever, but he didn't dress his characters up like they were, he used the costumes of his own time. For the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms. For example, in King John the English and French have cannons--in Robin Hood's day. In Julius Caesar they talk of chimneys, which wouldn't be invented for another thousand years, and in Henry IV they talk about Machiavelli, who wasn't even born yet then. So I think this objection is silly--you might as well complain that the play isn't in Danish (after all they live in Denmark don't they?).",Hamlet
187,pipesoflirael,Fantastic!,8,25 May 2006,"Though I am biased in that I actually like Shakespeare (unlike most of this country), I found the film incredible. It was just beautiful! Yes, Branagh can be criticized for taking definitive steps that were merely implied by the Bard (such as a sexual relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia). He also took out long-held literary assumptions which were just as faulty. For example, negating a romantic love between Hamlet and his mother totally changes their relationship and the film as a whole. I think Branagh, though obviously an egotist, has a great capacity as a director. The problem with Shakesperean films is that the directors have no knowledge of the text, but Branagh has that knowledge. He knows just how to make Hamlet work from the stage to the screen. While I can (somewhat) understand why their is such criticism over the time length of this film, I suggest that these critics attend the theater one night and see how long such a production takes you. Shakespeare was a theatrical writer. His work is theatrical and, therefore, Branagh kept it theatrical. If one has issues with length, then perhaps such pieces of art are not for you. I just can't say enough about this film and eagerly await the DVD release.",Hamlet

Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, remarried right away and hamlet gets upset about that since she marries King Hamlet's brother, Claudius. Hamlet is told by a spirit that he needs to revenge his father's death. The movie explains to the audience that revenge is a dish best served cold, meaning revenge always has a backlash. I didn't enjoy the movie since it was too long and since Hamlet didn't look like Hamlet should. Hamlet is supposed to be in school still, but he looks like a 30 year old man. I wouldn't recommend for younger audiences, but adults would probably enjoy it. I recommend you to spend your time doing something way more productive instead of watching this movie.",Hamlet
190,kaitlynntutt,Fantastic!!,9,25 February 2018,"The story of Hamlet, written by William Shakespeare is portrayed excelently in this rendition, which was directed by Kenneth Branagh. The story is fairly simple, a king is killed by his brother, Claudius, and the dead king's son, Hamlet, wants to avenge him. Claudius gets married to the dead king's wife, and Hamlet is enraged. Throughout the story Hamlet falls in and out of love with a philosopher's daughter, while attempting to find himself and decide what to do about Claudius. By the end of the story I was awestruck and the director is fabulous at portraying Hamlet. This movie offers an amazing portrayal of the character Ophelia, and gives great insight to how the characters feel. While this movie is very long, the acting and pronunciation is phenomenal and aid in understanding the story. It follows Shakespeare's views very well, and watchers can definitely connect with the characters. Children will probably not enjoy this film, seeing as how they use a lot of shakespearean language. I absolutely recommend this movie for adults and Shakespeare lovers, it portrays characters well, and shows the entirety of the story clearly. When Ophelia is going crazy, the actor does a fabulous job at showing it, and Hamlet is portrayed excellently. In comparison to the graphic novel, understanding the story is much easier when watching the movie because you can see more of the emotions characters possess.

This movie is about a young prince named Hamlet and his vengefulness for his father's death. Madness, treachery, and death takes place in Hamlet that goes along with the play. Karma is definitely a big part of this movie; bad actions lead to worse consequences. There is a decent amount of action, and the plot is very elaborate and detailed. This movie isn't for everyone because of the length and the poetic nature of the characters' speaking; however, if you like Shakespeare, action, and a great tragedy that unfolds, then you will definitely like this movie. I really likes how this movie followed Shakespeare's text exactly because the events that took place were the same, but it was very hard to understand what the character were saying due to Shakespeare's poetic writing ( ""Alas, poor Yorick!""). An event that was exactly the same was when Hamlet saw the ghost of his late father. Even though I couldn't exactly tell what the characters were saying the whole time, their actions spoke for themselves. There was so much emotion to the characters, so I definitely thought that the acting was phenomenal. I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids because they would most likely be confused or bored by watching it. I would recommend this movie for teens and young adults.

The movie is about Hamlet, a young prince, who is visited by his father's ghost and told to avenge his death. Hamlet faces many obstacles before he can do so. ""Hamlet"" shows viewers that love can make you crazy and that getting revenge on someone else will only come back and get you. The movie also follows the graphic novel and the original play very well, but there were some scenes that weren't quite as interesting as others. I feel that the actor who played Hamlet in the movie was a bit older than he was portrayed to be in the book and play.

193,huntervarnes,Extravagant!,8,23 February 2018,"In the 1996 film ""Hamlet,"" which was held in the setting of the Shakespearian Era, we meet a large variety of characters. The original play was written by Shakespeare and published in 1603. It was then reinvented into a movie; directed and acted by Kenneth Branagh. The movie was nominated for an Oscar award four times. 
 The film is slow-pace at first; but, once the climax is reached, the pace of the movie quickens. We learn about young Hamlet and how his fortunes goes rogue. At the beginning of the movie, we learn that Hamlet's father, who is King, has died. So, Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, has decided to marry Hamlet's uncle (AKA King Hamlet's brother). As the plot rolls along, tension between the characters increase. The tensions in the film teach us that even family can break apart. The actors try to give their own feelings to the viewers. As dark events occur throughout the movie, emotions are conveyed onto the viewers. 
 Personally, I did like the movie. Although technology is much different than it was in 1996, the setting is still portrayed in a successful way. In particular, the interior of the castle is extravagant. Adding to that, how the director incorporated traveling throughout the castle adds more to the story.
In conclusion, Some may find the plot too slow, or too long. However, everybody should give a classical era movie a chance. Many may turn away from the movie due to it not being in modern day language. But, body language, cameras, tone, and music conveys the feeling of the story.",Hamlet
194,laurenoldfield,Timeless Shakespeare,9,24 February 2018,"Hamlet, directed by Kenneth Branagh, is a Shakespearean Tragedy. For the most part, the movie consistently follows the original play, Hamlet, by William Shakespeare. Branagh stars as Hamlet himself, also known as the Prince of Denmark. While conflict is stirring between Denmark and Norway, Prince Hamlet is also returning home to find his father has been murdered. If you think that's not enough to dwell on, Hamlet's mother is also marrying his uncle Claudius. Throughout the entire film Hamlet's overall goal is to avenge his father's death; however, when romance and family comes into the equation things tend to spiral out of control. The movie does a fantastic job of representing how Shakespeare is timeless; therefore, this movie is suitable for teenagers and adults. The director has several messages conveyed throughout the movie, but the main point would be revenge isn't always sweet. During the movie, the only thing I did not care for was that the actors were hard to understand. I felt that the actors could have done a better job annunciating and speaking clearly. On a positive note, I liked that the director made it easier to comprehend the plot line by using props and the actors used facial expressions to their fullest potential. Also, it followed Shakespeare's original text very well.The director added a few of his own interpretations to fill a blank where Shakespeare didn't directly state what was happening, but it did not change the plot, in fact it made the movie better. I connected with a few characters because they were dealing with similar emotions that I have had in my life to a certain extent. Even if you have not read much Shakespeare, I think audiences will still enjoy this piece of work because of how timeless Shakespeare is. I have only read two pieces of Shakespeare's work and I still liked the movie because of how relatable the characters are. I do not think this movie is suitable for children under 13 because of the deep topics expressed and talked about throughout the entire movie. A few topics discussed is suicide, murder, sex, rape, death, and poison.

For example, Hamlet swung on a chandelier in the movie to kill Claudius, however in the book he just poisoned him. Another example would be when Hamlet threw the sword at Claudius, it went too far. The plot however was still was the same which I enjoyed.",Hamlet
196,charlesputman,Marvelous movie,7,26 February 2018,"The Shakespearean tragedy, ""Hamlet"", written by William Shakespeare and adapted by Kenneth Branagh was quite an interesting movie. Hamlet must get revenge for his father who appears to him as a ghost. Hamlet must go through many struggles in order to fulfill this task. The film delves into the question the Shakespeare incorporated into the play. That question is the meaning of life. It makes you really think about the topic just like Hamlet did. With all this being said, I am glad to say that it stayed quite true to the actual text. The film also did a great job keeping my attention the whole way through; which, is an amazing feat with how the long the movie plays on for. A few gripes that I do have are that some parts of the movie seemed rushed and did not last as long as in the book. This also applies for the opposite. Some scenes played on for a long time while in the text it lasted for a less amount of time. The last complaint that I have is that the ending was a little to dramatized. It was already dramatic in the text, but in the movie they made it a little to dramatic with the fight scene. Overall, I think that this movie is a must watch and that it is a great movie.",Hamlet
197,madelynkrus,Wonderful rendition,8,25 February 2018,"""Hamlet"", directed by Kenneth Branagh, was a close replica to Shakespeare's play Hamlet. Hamlet is a young prince and his father had been murdered. To make things worse, his mother married his uncle. Hamlet had been visited by the spirit of his father, explaining who murdered him. He begins to investigate the person that was suspected. Only for many other tragedies to happen along the way. I thought that the movie was a good representation of what happened in the play. It would be hard for people that have not read the play prior or understand the way Shakespeare speaks. But overall the movie was very good and I would watch it again.",Hamlet
198,kennedyrose,"Bravo, Branagh!",7,26 February 2018,"Hamlet, directed and starring Kenneth Branagh, is the movie adaptation of the Shakespeare play by the same name. Hamlet is the story of young Hamlet, whose sanity is spinning out of control as he attempts to seek revenge for his murdered father. This movie is near identical to the inspiration that it steamed from; however, Branagh makes bold choices as the director that make the movie more interesting for those who haven't read the play itself. Depending on your opinion of the play, this could or could not bother you. While there are some pacing issues, overall this film is a great adaptation of Shakespeare's work. If you're a fan of Shakespeare I would put this movie on your must watch list!",Hamlet

The catch is, his father's murderer was crowned king. He struggles to get revenge as everyone believes that he has gone mad. The plot demonstrates what happens when people are greedy or seek vengeance. Branagh did an excellent job adapting his film to the original play; the film was very similar to the original text. He made some bold choices while reimagining certain scenes, but his choices helped me to better understand the plot. The dialogue was difficult to follow, but that is typical for Shakespearean works. Overall, if you are a fan of Shakespeare, you will enjoy Branagh's film.",Hamlet
200,hannahzimmerman,Average Joe,6,23 February 2018,"""Hamlet,"" a Shakespearean tragedy directed by Kenneth Branagh, is about young Hamlet trying to get through his tragic life. Hamlet's father, Late Hamlet, was murdered by his own brother, Claudius. Plotting his revenge, Hamlet goes through many trials and tragedies to get what he wants. The movie goes side by side with the original play and graphic novel. I didn't exactly enjoy this movie experience because it was hard to understand the Shakespearean tongue, the director should've made it more modern for the time. Another reason is because it was a waste of time. It was much easier and quicker to read the graphic novel and get the same experience.",Hamlet
201,ellisahadsall,Truly Spectacular,9,26 February 2018,"This is truly the perfect rendition of Hamlet. Kenneth Branagh has given us Shakespeare's play just the way it was meant to be. Nothing has been omitted,not a single line or scene. Even the specific phrasing and delivery of the lines are perfect. Kenneth gives the best rendition of the ""To Be or Not To Be"" soliloquy that I have ever seen. When I first saw the film I truly believed this is how Shakespeare would want it. Though they added a bit of ""Hollywood Drama"" I truly believe this is a beautiful version of Hamlet.",Hamlet
202,faithhaley,Excellent!,8,26 February 2018,"""Hamlet"", based on the Shakespearean tragedy, directed by Kenneth Branagh, is an excellent retelling of the play. It delves into the life of prince Hamlet, and his thirst for vengeance for his father. Throughout the movie, the plot is almost exact to that of the play. We are reading this in English class, and the movie is a perfect comprension aid if anybody in the class has trouble understanding a scene. Luckily, the acting wasn't too cheesy, so it was enjoyable to watch. The only trouble I came across was that the director had his own take on scenes. For example, we were having a discussion in class about if Gertrude knew if the cup was poisoned before she drank it. The play didn't really give an answer to that, but in the movie, we seem to be more sure of the answer. Although instances like that popped up a few times, it didn't take away from the movie at all, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed reading the play!",Hamlet
203,derekmeier,An Almost Beautiful Rendition,8,26 February 2018,"The 1996 film adaptation of the play written by William Shakespeare, Hamlet, is directed by Kenneth Branagh. The movie follows the young prince Hamlet, out to avenge his father, Hamlet Senior. Hamlet is a movie of regicide, murder, and deceit. Due to it's hard to understand nature, Hamlet is best suited for students and adults. The movie does a very good job following the version William Shakespeare had created, but failed at staying true until the end. Instead of creating an ending which follows the play, the movie decided to change it to make it more 'entertaining'. Other than that, the acting in this movie is handled quite well, although some scenes are overly emphasized. Overall, the movie does suffer in some regards, but truly deserves more credit than it has been given. This movie is a must watch for Shakespeare lovers, but may be passed for anyone else.",Hamlet
204,ethanmckeever-36001,A Fantastic Recreation,9,24 February 2018,"Hamlet, a Shakespearean tragedy directed by Kenneth Branagh, recreates the original play by William Shakespeare in a mostly faithful manner. As the name implies, the film stars Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, in his struggles to avenge the death of his father. By the end of the plot, the film can teach the lesson that vengeance isn't always going to end well; Shakespeare likely chose this lesson to make a statement about how various conflicts are solved by violence. As such, the film is best suited to teenagers and adults who have a better understanding of the Shakespearean language and knowledge of common problems in the world. However, if the viewer has read or watched the original play, they will notice a few inconsistencies between the two. For example, certain action scenes played out differently in the film to make them more dramatic. Despite this, the film is a well made adaptation, if not a bit lengthy. Overall, the film is worth watching if you have the time for it.",Hamlet
205,connormayall-56104,A must watch movie!,10,23 February 2018,"Kenneth Branagh's rendition of Shakespeare's tragic play Hamlet is flawless; to say the least. Kenneth did a terrific job making the movie follow the plot of the novel; however, there are certain times where it strays from the novel. These slight differences are barely noticeable to the average viewer and thus won't hinder one's viewing pleasure. Kenneth's purpose in developing this movie would be to bring Shakespeare's play to the theater world and to entertain the viewers. The appropriate audience would be anywhere from the range of young teens to senior citizens. I liked this movie because it follows the main plot very well by keeping all the same characters and the actors also did a great job speaking ""Shakespearean"" and using the original lines. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that was willing to view it and it is a definite must watch movie.",Hamlet
206,bretlink-66761,Typical Shakespeare,7,26 February 2018,"In the movie Hamlet, written by William Shakespeare and directed by Kenneth Branagh, Hollywood meets old fashioned Shakespearean plays. The main character, Hamlet, begins his journey with a familiar face telling him the truth about his father's strange death. Hamlet sets out to expose the truth of his father's death to Denmark and figure out what is really going on through love, madness, and even murder. Hamlet is a great representation of how greed and vengeance can lead to malicious acts. The movie follows the main text well for a movie remake. Even with that, it was not easy to follow the characters or connect with them throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie only for people with a good knowledge of Shakespearean plays. Although the movie was good, the language is not easy to follow. Kids probably won't enjoy this movie. The language, little action, and drawn out long dialogue makes this movie rather boring for the young fellas. The director did a very good job of interpreting confusing scenes into how he saw them. An example of this would be the scene where Ophelia is giving out flowers. Rather than having her hand out real flowers, the director followed the characteristic that Ophelia had gone mad by making the flowers imaginary for the movie. Another plus is the addition of flashbacks during the dialogue. For example, the director showed Hamlet Sr.'s death while the characters were discussing it in one of the firsts scenes. If you've made it this far, chances are you probably don't have a problem with old Shakespeare and understand the language. For you, I'd recommend you watch this movie. It will help you understand the play better and offer another perspective on the confusing language that you didn't have a clue on what was going on.",Hamlet
207,eriksivertsen-52715,Well done,8,26 February 2018,"Hamlet is a play written by William Shakespeare remastered in movie form by Kenneth Branagh. Hamlet is about a prince seeking revenge for the death of his father as his obsession slowly drives him crazy. Kenneth Branagh did a very nice job on this movie, I'll admit that I really liked this movie. That being said: Some of the dialogue in the movie is hard to understand but I won't blame Branagh for this because in shakespeare's original writings it's kind of hard to understand. Branagh's interpretation however does trade some of the source material for his own twist on such as the final scene where he adds some more action to it which is fine for me because it's enjoyable. You can tell the actors are enjoying reading their line from the amount of effort that they put into it, however sometimes it's to over the top and just laughable. The cinematography is well done but it starts to feel the same with the same constant rotational shots on a dolly camera whenever the characters are exchanging dialogue; this isn't noticeable if you aren't looking for it or if your invested in the story. I would recommend seeing this if your just someone who watches movies, just want to laugh at the goofy dialogue and how it's delivered, or if you want to appreciate one of shakespeare's classics revisualised in the modern day.",Hamlet
208,alyssaslaight,To watch or not to watch,7,25 February 2018,"In the movie Hamlet, a Shakespearean tragedy, written by William Shakespeare and directed by Kenneth Branagh, the actors portrayed many parts with excellence and followed the play's write to the fullest. 
The movie Hamlet, shows young Prince Hamlet, a conflicted Dane, battling with his emotions while dealing with the death of his father. He begins to suspect foul play in King Hamlet's death and vows to avenge his death. Hamlet depicts very dramatic and tragic scenes throughout the movie, keeping the watchers very attentive as the plot progresses.
The director and screenwriters kept the script very close to the original play, making only a few slight changes in dialogue. This kept the movie very similar in comparison to the play, making it less confusing and easier to understand.
Although there are many great aspects of the movie, I felt that it lacked in certain areas. For example, actors with a smaller or less important role seemed to be disconnected and distant from the scenes in the movie. I also feel that during some of the soliloquies, it was difficult to understand what was being said, due to how fast they were speaking. 
This play would most likely be directed towards people in their mid-teens years since some scenes and dialogue would be hard for anyone younger than that to comprehend.
In summary, Hamlet is a well-written movie that keeps to the original play. This makes it easy to understand and watch. The movie keeps with the storyline and has a very dramatic plot that keeps the watches attentive. It is definitely worth watching.",Hamlet
209,owenwatson,"A very long movie, but a theatrical thriller! by: Owen Watson",7,26 February 2018,"In the play/movie, ""Hamlet"" by the great William Shakespeare, Hamlet goes through a tremendous amount of pain throughout his entire life. In the exciting thriller, Hamlet's father has died. As Hamlet is grieving his fathers death, he sees a ghost. The ghost turns out to be his dead father. Hamlet then finds out that his father had been killed by his Uncle Claudius who had just became the king and married his mother. Hamlet knows that his father has died, and he wants to seek revenge. Hamlet deals with many different obstacles such as the star crossed lovers of Hamlet and Ophelia, Hamlet having to deal with his mother marrying Claudius, and everyone getting in the way of him seeking revenge. Does Hamlet get revenge on the killer of his father, or does he not accomplish his mission? Watch the movie to find out. The message that William Shakespeare provides is that everybody can be sinners at times, and if you sin a little to much, then bad things may happen to you. The intended audience of this play and movie is anyone who likes to watch a little supsense not knowing what is going to happen next. It is also for people who have a long attention span because the movie ranges over a little four hours. Something that I truly like about the movie is although the plot can get boring, it is just adding up, and the climax is very suspenseful. What I don't like about the movie is the way that they talk. This follows all of Shakespeare's texts because of the way that they talk. I reccomend that adults watch the play because it has a good background story, but kids should not because it is not appropriate. A part that I really liked is when Hamlet tried attacking Claudius. In all, if you wan't a story where suspense constantly builds up, and where nobody can trust anyone, then this is the movie.for you!",Hamlet
210,kathrynwaughtel,"A stunning film, with a tragic twist",9,26 February 2018,"Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' takes the audience on a four hour journey through betrayal, heartache, and loss. This film version of Shakespeare novel brings the characters to life, using many of the same quotes from the book and encases the audience in a wild ride. Hamlet, played by Kenneth Branagh himself, was portrayed well. He spoke his lines as if they came from his heart. His loss of his father, confronted with his mother's remarriage, was pulled throughout the story causing the audience to tune in closely. Hamlet watches many people around him change throughout the novel, which results in him changing too. The story ends like any other Shakespearean story: in tragedy. This story provides a sense of entertainment, with a message. It comes across that everyone gets what they deserve. The film follows the quite well; however, in times the director took his own spin/take on a part. I recommend this movie but would advise following the text to understand what is being said. As a young adult I would recommend this film to a more mature audience.",Hamlet
211,mckennachurchill,Great Adaptation of a Shakespearean Classic,10,27 February 2018,"In the movie, Hamlet, directed by Kenneth Branagh, Prince Hamlet recently has returned from England only to discover that his father was mysteriously murdered and his mother remarrying his uncle, Claudius. One night, Hamlet comes face to face with the ghost of his deceased father, King Hamlet, who reveals that Claudius is the man who murdered him and asks Hamlet one thing, to seek revenge. Throughout this literary adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most well known plays, Kenneth Branagh leaves everyone on the edge of their seats as they follow Hamlet and his plot to seek revenge. The play itself is one to watch for, but the big screen adaptation is right there with it. The characters, emotions and actions were flawlessly shown throughout the film, leaving no complaints from myself. Though this may not be a movie recommended for those under the age of 13, Hamlet is acceptable to show to freshman in highschool and adults of any age. To conclude, the silver screen adaptation of Hamlet, is an exceptional movie and highly recommended for those who are fans of Shakespeare's work or for those who just want to enjoy a movie.",Hamlet
212,semi_sweet19,I really loved it!!,10,9 January 2006,"I thought that this was a very accurate representation of the original works. Nothing was cut out, making it very thorough and easy to understand. The thing that I found interesting was that even though it was quite long, this didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie itself and in fact did just the opposite. The acting was of good quality which added a lot. I personally enjoyed Kate Winslet as Ophelia. There were times her antics actually had an eerie effect on me, and that is what they were meant to do. My only complaint would be to say that certain parts were hard to take seriously because, the lack of a proper and steady accent was too distracting. However, despite that, it was all in all a very good film that I would definitely recommend to any Shakespeare fan such as myself.",Hamlet
