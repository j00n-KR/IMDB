0,Leofwine_draca,Excellent suspense thriller,9,6 September 2016,"NO WAY OUT is a bit of an oddity. For the first hour or so, I watched this in complete indifference, waiting for the real 'plot' to begin. Watching Costner and Young sleeping together was repetitive and pretty dated, full of '80s tunes and cheesy scenes, like the one in the back of the limousine. Then Hackman's character sets the plot off for real, and suddenly I was hooked. I was behind Costner's character all the way, and I loved the way the scriptwriter trapped him within the imprisoning confines of the Pentagon, hunting for a wronged man whom he knew to be himself. I thought the suspense and twists played out very well. Often in suspense movies, writers are happy to throw out all the old clichés – such as the ticking bomb – but the computer recognition software really makes this film and gives it an edge over its competition.There was a sense of urgency that I rarely find elsewhere in the movies. My heart was pounding as Costner's plight became ever more deadly and how his enemies were gradually closing in. A COMMANDO-style action set-piece in a shopping mall threatens to destroy credibility, but then the suspense comes back stronger than ever, lasting right until the thrilling ending. Then we get an extra coda, one of those big 'twist' endings that throws the whole previous film on its head. I have to say that I disliked this twist. It didn't feel real, and it felt tacked-on as a last minute thing (""oh, wouldn't that be cool?""). To be honest, I would have preferred the film without it, but there we go.A strong cast delivers a fine script in this one. It's one of Costner's best movies, and Hackman's multi-layered villain is another solid entry in the actor's career. Will Patton is delightfully evil as the slimy aide. Other good characters are George Dzundza as Costner's wheelchair-bound buddy and Marshall Bell and Chris D as a couple of hulking hit men. NO WAY OUT is one of those films that doesn't have to have shoot-outs every five minutes to be exciting – in fact, the action scenes are few and far between, and I counted just a couple of them. No, here the urgency comes from the well-plotted situation the central character finds himself in – and it's a rare beast to find a film so enthralling because of that.",No Way Out
1,SnoopyStyle,Great Kevin Costner thriller,8,10 August 2014,"Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is a naval officer who is being interrogated. Six months earlier, Farrell got involved with Susan Atwell (Sean Young) without knowing that she's the mistress to the secretary of defense David Brice (Gene Hackman). He's starting a new job under Brice working with an old friend Scott Pritchard (Will Patton). Eventually Farrell finds out that Brice is the other man. A jealous Brice strikes Susan off the balcony to her death. Pritchard works to cover it up and find the other lover who is a possible witness. There is a negative to a Polaroid under the bed and Pritchard claims it as a photo of a KGB mole. Farrell is put in charge as Sam Hesselman (George Dzundza) tries to regenerate the photo.It's a terrific noir thriller. Once the movie turns into an investigation, the paranoia and the intensity ramp up multiple folds. It's like a runaway train. It's an exciting psychological thriller without the action scenes. With this, Kevin Costner is on his way to becoming the biggest star in Hollywood.",No Way Out
2,claudio_carvalho,Excellent Thriller even When You See for the Fourth Time,8,19 December 2010,"In Washington, the Defense Secretary David Brice (Gene Hackman) has a political dispute with Senator William 'Billy' Duvall (Howard Duff) about the project of a submarine. He asks his adviser Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) to invite the Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner), who has become a national hero after rescuing a sailor during a storm, to join his team. Farrell meets Susan Atwell (Sean Young) in a party and they have a torrid love affair. Farrell learns that Susan is Brice's mistress but he falls in love with her. They spend a weekend together and when they return to Susan's apartment, Brice rings the bell. The upset Farrell leaves the apartment and sees Brice waiting for Susan. Brice has an argument with Susan and pushes her from the balcony. She falls on a glass table and dies. Brice panics and reports the accident to Pritchard. However, the Machiavellian chief of staff accuses the imaginary Soviet mole Yuri of murdering Susan. Farrell is assigned to lead the investigations to find the identity of Yuri, and gets in serious situation with the presence of witnesses of his weekend with Susan and the regeneration of a Polaroid photo that was found in Susan's apartment. ""No Way Out"" is an excellent thriller of the 80's even when you see it for the fourth time. The impact of course is reduced, since the plot has one of the most unexpected conclusions, with a twist in the very end that was the motive of several discussions with friends, but it is still a great film. This is one of the best roles of Kevin Costner and Sean Young is incredibly beautiful and sensual. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sem Saída"" (""No Way Out"")",No Way Out
3,Tweekums,A slow start but a thrilling conclusion!,7,3 March 2012,"The opening where the camera moves from the heart of Washington DC, over the Pentagon to a house in the suburbs where a navel officer is being questioned tells us that this will be a political thriller with a naval connection; once that has been established the action jumps pack six months and tells us how the officer, Lt. Cmdr. Tom Farrell, came to be there. His story starts when he goes to a Washington political event where his old acquaintance Scott Prichard introduces him to his boss; Defense Secretary David Brice. This meeting is fairly cursory but the party isn't a total disaster; he ends up leaving with a woman, Susan Atwell, and spending the night with her. They start a relationship although he knows she is involved with another man. It turns out the other man is Brice and it isn't long before Farrell is working directly for him. Farrell continues his relationship and when Brice learns that Susan is seeing another man he becomes jealous and in the scuffle that follows Susan falls over the balcony is killed. Brice is ready to go to the police but Prichard thinks he knows away around the problem; what if the 'other man' was the rumoured Soviet spy known as 'Yuri'. Farrell is brought in to head the investigation; not an easy job when he knows that ultimately he will be exposed and likely killed... he will have to find proof against the real killer first.This film opened rather slowly; setting up Farrell's relationship with Sarah and showing some Washington politics meant that the real drama that started with Sarah's death didn't begin for three quarters of an hour. Once we were into the investigation things got much better though; even though the action is fairly limited it is pretty tense. Kevin Costner does a pretty good job as Farrell although there wasn't much chemistry between him and Sean Young who played Sarah. The best performance came from Will Patton who was great as Scott Prichard; a truly unpleasant character who will stop at nothing to protect his boss. There are certain aspects of the film that seem dated and I don't mean the eighties hairdos and technology; much of the music seems like it comes from a particularly cliché TV movie... saxophone music for the fairly tame sex scenes! There is a decent twist at the end but I won't spoil it here!",No Way Out
4,edwagreen,No Way Out-is Perfect Way In ****,10,5 February 2013,"All out action-packed thriller showcasing what can happen when high leveled people in the government have mistresses.Kevin Costner plays a liaison to the Secretary of Defense, Gene Hackman. Problem is that they're both having affairs with the same woman, who is killed by Hackman accidentally in a rage.The real acting kudos goes to Will Patton, the gay assistant to Hackman who dreams up that a Russian spy, named Yury did the killing. Problem is that Costner had just left the house before Hackman came and committed the crime.The movie is wonderfully tense along the way as government officials look for this Yury, appearing that it is Costner, as there are two witnesses who saw them together during a weekend fling.How Costner evades capture is most exciting and the surprise ending that shows that there really was a Yury is an emotional wallop on a roller-coaster of a great film.",No Way Out
5,sunwarrior13,No Way Out: A Masterpiece Spy Thriller,10,29 December 2011,"No Way Out is a thriller about a U.S. Naval officer investigating a Washington, D.C. murder. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman and Sean Young. It is a remake of The Big Clock; both films are based on the novel by Kenneth Fearing.The supporting cast includes Will Patton, Howard Duff, George Dzundza, Jason Bernard, Fred Thompson and Iman.It was written by Robert Garland and directed by Roger Donaldson.While at a Washington party, Tom meets Susan Atwel, and they're soon sharing a steamy love scene in the back of a limo. Several months pass before Tom meets Susan again; he discovers she's the mistress of the US Secretary of Defense David Brice. When Susan is murdered by Brice, his loyal aide dutifully destroys the evidence and invents the fallacious theory that a KGB mole was responsible. Tom is assigned to locate that mole -- a perilous situation, since Tom knows that no such mole exists, but must go along with the charade since he was the last person who was seen with Susan.Farrell obtains the printout before the picture implicating him becomes visible and presents it to Brice, who then shifts the blame to Pritchard, arguing that Pritchard was jealous of his relationship with Susan. A devastated Pritchard commits suicide and is falsely exposed as ""Yuri"" to the police by Brice, hoping to escape blame for Susan's death, and Farrell, who is finally able to leave the Pentagon free of suspicion.As Farrell sits beside Susan's grave, two plainclothes men arrive and take him away for questioning. One of the interrogators is Farrell's landlord, who addresses Farrell in Russian. Farrell, who responds in kind is, in fact, the real ""Yuri"" and his landlord is his KGB supervisor. Yuri/Farrell was planted in the U.S. as a teenager and became the KGB's ""mole"" in the Department of Defense. Aware of Brice's affair, the Russians assigned Farrell to seduce the Secretary of Defense's mistress and gather intelligence from her. Although his handlers demand that he return to the Soviet Union, Farrell refuses and leaves as his handler quips, ""He'll be back. Where else does he have to go?""Roger Donaldson's modern spin on No Way Out is dense and stylish.This suspense film has features of the 1940s thrillers but it was terrific and ingenious that a viewer who likes good movies would surely appreciate.In it,we get to see fine performances from stars Gene Hackman and Sean Young.Truly,it was a career-making performance for Kevin Costner as it catapulted him to stardom as he displays some charisma in a twisty, stylish espionage thriller.It was truly a masterpiece in its genre as a film in which a simple situation grows more and more complex and neither of which is contrived nor manipulated.",No Way Out

7,hitchcockthelegend,Counting down the hours for some self investigation.,8,18 May 2013,"No Way Out is directed by Roger Donaldson and adapted to screenplay by Robert Garland from the novel ""The Big Clock"" written by Kenneth Fearing. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, Will Patton, George Dzundza and Howard Duff. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Alcott.Already filmed impressively as The Big Clock in 1948, Fearing's ingenious source material gets a shift to a Pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner. Putting their own spin on the central story, that of a man finding he is investigating ""himself"" during a murder enquiry, the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end.In true noir style, the story is crammed with double bluffs, deceit, sex and death, with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further. Cast are led superbly by Costner and Hackman, though Young is a bit too dull an actress to really put fire into the key femme role, and Alcott makes great use of the real Washington locations to bring visual authenticity to the story's setting.Jarre's score is hokey sounding and doesn't sit right with the dramatics on show, while the big reveal at the finale is still as divisive today as it was back on the film's release, but this is still a fine example of a film noir remake that really works for the neo-noir loving crowd. 8/10",No Way Out
8,LeonLouisRicci,Entertaining Regan Era Yuppie Yarn of Power & Politics...A Bit Overbaked,7,5 July 2017,"The First Act Sex Scenes are Goofy, Loony and Overdone, going on way too Long. Sean Young's Seductress is Hammy, Overdressed, and Badly Acted. The Music is Dated and the Slick, Brightly Lit, Beginning is Baked Beyond the Ding of the Timer.Kevin Costner, before He became an Uncontrollable Egomaniac and Ruined the Middle of an A-List Career (in later years came back to earth and has become respectable again), is Fine, Fit, and Oddly Handsome. Unlike His Female Co-Star it is a Believable Performance. The Movie really doesn't Heat Up Until the Second Act despite Director Donaldson's Heavy Hand in the First almost taking the Thing to an Absurd Level that Betrays its Noir Roots.Gene Hackman Underplays as the Secretary of Defense and Will Patton Overplays as His Confidant and Adviser. Hackman is Virtually Wallpaper Observing from the Background. The Supporting Cast Settle in and the Film Finds its Footing in Confined Confusion with Twists and Turns, Suspense and Intrigue.Overall, it's an Overrated Reagan-Era Yuppie Yarn of Power and Politics that is Superficial but Entertaining Enough and is Above Average for its Type from the Era.

I'm not a fan of sex, lies, and murder and I hate love triangles.Man, I struggled to watch this movie. I suppose the early gratuitous and easy sex was supposed to draw me in, but instead it had me turn it off. Reluctantly, I turned it back on to see if it would materialize into something worthwhile. No, it didn't.All this cloak and dagger running around stuff because two dudes were banging the same chick. Dude number two, Kevin Costner, porked her before he even knew her name, then fell in love with her. When dude number one, Gene Hackman, killed her it became a real mess.",No Way Out

When he starts seeing an alluring young woman, he thinks he's on top of the world. What he doesn't know is that his new girlfriend is also his boss's mistress! This is a fast-paced, intense thriller with a hot romance, exciting action scenes, and twists and turns in nearly every scene. If you like thrillers, you'll love this!

11,Wuchakk,Life in DC and The Pentagon during the mid-80s,6,23 May 2018,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Roger Donaldson, ""No Way Out"" is a political drama/thriller starring Keven Costner as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy who falls in love with a woman of dubious morality (Sean Young) and is thrust into a cover-up/witch hunt after a tragedy. Gene Hackman plays his ""boss"" at the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, while Will Patton appears as the Secretary's loyal and diligent assistant.This remake of 1948's ""The Big Clock"" makes great use of Washington DC & surrounding area (e.g. Arlington) with sweet opening and closing aerial views. The Pentagon is a focal point with much of the drama taking place in that iconic building. There's a worthy surprise in the plot so pay attention.Roger Ebert overrated this movie in 1987, giving it a perfect rating. The first half is a great setup, but the second half is merely okay and sometimes comes off as a TV production, verging on amateurish (you'll see what I mean). The photo that the computer slowly materializes is a particularly quaint element; and the distinctly 80's score doesn't help.Still, there's enough good here to make ""No Way Out"" worth checking out if it sounds appealing to you. Although Hackman is almost wasted in a role where he is relegated to sitting around looking concerned, Patton's passionate work makes up for it; Costner and Young too.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in DC, Virginia (Arlington & Alexandria), Maryland (Annapolis) and the Toronto airport. WRITERS: Kenneth Fearing (novel) and Robert Garland (screenplay).GRADE: B-/C+",No Way Out
12,Mr-Fusion,"Taut, engaging Cold War thriller",7,12 November 2015,"As political thrillers go, ""No Way Out"" is right up there, surprising in its lasting effectiveness. Put simply, it holds up, and if you can abide the unfortunate score, then you're in for something pretty cool. Costner proves his leading man capabilities and the whole cast is good (it even features an uncharacteristically emotive Will Patton). I guess it's a good rule of thumb that if you need a corrupt politician, you can't go wrong with Gene Hackman. Hackman's reliable in just about any role, but even more so here.Without spoiling anything, this has a really memorable ending; the kind that just sorta sneaks up behind you and punches you in the mouth. But even knowing what ultimately happens in this story, I still got caught up in the main espionage plot: Costner trying to outsmart a frameup as the walls close in; almost enough to make me forget the final twist. That says a lot about the craft behind such a movie.7/10",No Way Out
13,MovieAddict2016,A pretty good government thriller with some nice twists...,7,29 January 2004,"Having lived around the outskirts of Washington, D.C. myself, it's always a nice treat to watch a film that literally takes place right where I have stood, at one time or another. It's just very fun to know that a famous movie was shot where you once walked. (Although I now regret visiting the set of ""101 Dalmations"" in London--that's one story I don't often tell people with a smile on my face.)At the beginning of ""No Way Out,"" we get to see Washington from above as the camera glides through the air, swerving and going around in circles, until we land inside a small interrogation room housing a convicted murderer (Kevin Costner), who is in fact innocent and has been framed. ""When's he coming out?"" he asks as he walks over to a one-way mirror and looks through the glass. Right as we start to think, ""Whom is he talking to?"" (Or ""Does he mean Hackman?"" if you've read anything about the film), we fall backwards in time and land in the same place some number of months earlier.""No Way Out"" is a government thriller about an officer wrongly accused of murder--when the Secretary of State himself is the culprit trying to avoid a scandal by launching a top-secret cover-up. Costner is the officer, and Gene Hackman is the Secretary of State. After meeting a beautiful young woman (Sean Young) at a party, Costner takes her into a limo and they have a quickie--before they even know each other's names. What's this got to do with anything? Why is my review so choppy and linear-challenged? We'll get there.The relationship between the two turns into a big romance until Costner is sent out to sea, where he saves a sailor from falling overboard and is praised in all the papers--where his girlfriend back home sees his face and is reminded of him. (Now she's the mistress of Hackman, by the way--that complicates matters quite a bit.)When he arrives back home, they go on a romantic getaway--but Hackman finds out and accidentally murders the girl while trying to get her to tell him the name of her lover. Ready to turn himself in, Hackman is persuaded by his gay friend to cover everything up and blame someone else. The gay man even goes and gets rid of the evidence himself--with pride, I might add. (It's like Mr. Burns and Smithers from ""The Simpsons""--the latter loves the former, but the former is too powerful and naive to ever notice.)The clever twist in ""No Way Out"" is that Costner knows Hackman killed Young, but Hackman doesn't know that he knows that. (Get it?) As he runs around the Pentagon and other government establishments, the evidence starts to pile up against him--the negative off the back of a Polaroid camera, a few eyewitnesses who claim they saw a man outside Young's apartment the night of her murder, etc.The great thing about ""No Way Out,"" and another factor that separates it from the rest of its kind, is something that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen the film. Essentially, no one knows who killed the girl--and Costner isn't placed under arrest straight away because no one has uncovered any evidence pointing towards him. As the negative off the back of the Polaroid is scanned through a computer and painstakingly altered to reveal the man's face on the photo, Costner runs around trying to eliminate evidence before anyone finds out. The photo will eventually reveal his own face, yes, but he has a number of hours until then to find the true evidence that convicts Hackman.This is a smart thriller with a few pleasant twists, particularly the very end. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's well-acted and solidly directed by Roger Donaldson, who also made last year's ""The Recruit"" with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. The guy obviously likes government thrillers. This one is a lot more plausible than ""The Recruit,"" too.4/5 stars.John Ulmer",No Way Out
14,disdressed12,exciting and suspenseful,9,24 May 2008,"to me,this is a brilliant political/military suspense/thriller.it's starts off pretty quickly and just goes from there.there isn't a lot of time for character development in this movie,but the suspense and intrigue makes up for it.there are some great actors here,including Kevin Costner,Gene Hackman,and Will Patton.Costner and Hackmman are good,but Patton really impressed me here.George Dzunda also stars and his role is small,but i thought he was very good.i also liked Sean young.it's too bad we don't see her in that many movies.many people might say this is a formulaic movie,and that could be true,but there are bad formulaic movies and good formulaic movies.for me,this falls into the very good category.for one thing,it kept my attention the whole time and was very exciting.my vote for No Way Out:a 9/10",No Way Out
15,thesar-2,"NO WAY, Indeed",8,2 November 2020,"Wow, as good as this was and it was only slightly above good, the ending I DID NOT SEE COMING FROM 50 MILES AWAY sold me all the way to a solid 8/10 stars.Never saw this before tonight, but I've known of it since it came out. Probably never seen it because for the longest time I couldn't stand Kevin Costner. Then he made Dances with Wolves and I loved him. Then he made Waterworld and The Postman Back to Back, so I didn't like him again.But, then I opened my eyes. Noticed him in so many other movies where he was basically perfect and I've been a Costner fan ever since. No way out of this last bond.So, tonight, while looking for a political thriller - hopefully slow burn, I came across this title in my research. With the HIGH recommendation I found, plus Costner and an all-star cast of the late 80s, I watched it. I knew the basic-basic plot and began, subconsciously looking for clues as I'm accustomed to these late 80s thrillers.Costner's high-ranking Naval Officer is having a relationship with Sean Young who also happens to be dating his newest boss, The Secretary of Defense. Easy peasy, but muddy. And then, bam, a wrench/twist is thrown in and Costner has to work with/around a coverup even though he might be a suspect, himself.And that's like 40% of the story. Watch for the rest.I was rewarded with what I needed: a slow-burn, political thriller. This is 100% that, until the inevitable and messy climax that 100% elevates this above expectations. Sorry I didn't see this sooner, but glad I finally did.***Final thoughts: #1 boy, I'm glad I changed my mind to Costner. He is one incredible, thoughtful and brilliant actor. #2, unrelated, half-way thru I wondered if Hackman is still alive. Fair question, he's been out of the spotlight for a while. He is, and also 90. 90! Sadly, Sean Connery JUST died yesterday, and he was 90.

18,Robert_duder,A low key thriller with impressive performances,7,3 August 2005,"When you think of a thriller...especially an eighties thriller you tend to think of action, drama, suspense and No Way Out has a little of all that without being so outwardly bold and brazen. Director Roger Donaldson who has done this type of film before chooses to play the roles low key with less pizazz and more drama. It's really the actors that hold your attention almost as if you were watching a great stage play. The story is not all that unique but the very surprising twist at the end makes it all the more interesting, as it's a complete and utter blow to the entire plot.No Way Out is the story of Commander Tom Farrell, a navy man with experience in Naval Intelligence and a desire to work in the Pentagon with the Secretary of Defense. Farrell has a contact on the inside, an old friend who is now the Secretary's right hand man, Scott Pritchard. Pritchard tries to introduce Farrell to the Secretary at a lavish party but the Secretary blows him off. Farrell stays at the party and meets an attractive woman who apparently is there with a married man. The two of them hit it off and end up leaving the party together and beginning a very steamy passionate affair. Secretary of Defense Brice begins to have issues with the CIA director who doesn't particularly like him. They are both fighting over how to handle the issue of ""Phantom Submarines"" that are undetectable by radar. Brice decides to hire a liaison to the intelligence community and comes across Farrell's name in conjunction with a heroic act of him saving one of his crew members aboard a ship. Brice brings Farrell aboard and Farrell moves to Washington and continues his affair with the woman. As it turns out the other man this woman is seeing is none other than the Secretary of Defense. Farrell and the woman continue their relationship and even go away together and when they return Brice visits his mistress and is angry about her absence. While he's slapping her around he accidentally pushes her over the staircase and she falls to her death. Brice's right hand man Pritchard swings into action determined to cover up the death for Brice. They launch a full scale investigation claiming that the man this woman was seeing was a soviet spy within the Pentagon and they must find this man. They put Farrell in charge of the investigation and all the facts are starting to point towards him as he struggles to stop them from discovering that he was her other boyfriend. Time is running out for Farrell and he realizes his only way out of this is to prove Brice's connection with this woman. Even his closest friends are turning on him and time is running out.Kevin Costner, who is one of my favorite actors, plays the young, hunky Commander quite well although it's kind of an A-Typical role for Costner. He does well with it. Same with veteran Actor Gene Hackman, who is not playing a role entirely new to him but still does a good job. One of the best roles is played by Will Patton who really is the devil's advocate behind it all. He plays both sides of the field and will do anything to protect Brice's reputation. Infamous eighties film actress Sean Young who has always annoyed me to death doesn't quite annoy me as much in this film but she still has her usual style of overact, get naked, and try to impress. The film is a small look into Washington Power and an intense cover up with an odd but shocking twist at the end of it all. It's a decent renter that won't stick with you necessarily but won't disappoint. Fans of Costner will enjoy this one. Worth watching!! 7.5/10",No Way Out
19,inkblot11,"Put Costner firmly on the map, a bit risqué at times, but very entertaining overall",7,6 October 2008,"Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is a handsome Naval officer. At a D.C. party, he meets up with an attractive and outspoken woman, Susan (Sean Young). Skipping out on the rest of the festivities, the two have extremely close encounter in the back of a cab. Each seems smitten with the other and when Tom is sent back to active duty in the Pacific, they vow to stay connected. But, things are complicated. For one, Susan's apartment and wardrobe are paid for by a married and quite powerful politician, David Brice (Gene Hackman) in exchange for trysts at her place. From the start, Tom wants her to break things off with Brice but she finds this difficult. Tom, too, may have a few secrets up his sleeve as well, including allegations by others that he is a spy. The situation becomes very difficult when Tom rescues his fellow mates at sea, earning honors and a promotion to the Washington area and Brice gets wind that Susan may be seeing someone else. What follows next is a major crime, a cover-up, and a cover-up over that, too. Who will be left standing? This is an intriguing film which established Costner's star power, well, forever. He makes an ultra-handsome, charming, acrid, and rebellious Navy man and his opening encounter with Young is hot stuff, perhaps too much so for some viewers (it is an R-rated film, though). Young, too, is most beautiful and provocative as the gold-digging woman of convenience who demonstrates that her heart is still up for grabs. As for Hackman, he is scary beyond belief, showing the world that folks in power can get away with just about anything. Will Patton is fine in a lesser but important role. The scenery, in D.C. and the Maryland coast, is gorgeous, as are the costumes (especially Young's) and the photography. In addition, the writing is clever and suspenseful and the direction is very sure-footed and intriguing. In short, if you want to know why Costner became a major star, see this film. There is no way out from agreeing that Kevin was talented and hot, hot, hot but even if you don't care for him, the film is very entertaining.",No Way Out

It never loses its zing, because the acting performances are all so strong.Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman play two sides of the romantic triangle that revolves around the super-sexy Sean Young. A clever and forceful script keeps the action taut, which further accentuates the wonderful acting. Watch for Will Patton as the political gunslinger who is the villainous operative of Hackman.The story takes place in, and is defined by, Washington, D.C. It feels like the city is a character in the film. Though its story is very much a part of the time when it was filmed---during the Cold War---its elements are so strong that it transcends its time.This is Kevin Costner in the middle of ""Silverado"", ""American Flyers"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"".

In this remake of the terrific 1948 film noir ""The Big Clock,"" the setting is changed from a corporation to the military and the plot is expanded to reflect technological advances. The plot expansion is a bad idea, as the film tends to drag, especially in the first half. While Elsa Lanchester provided welcome comic relief in the earlier film, no such luck here. Costner is rather bland while Hackman is underused. The acting honors go to Patton, who is riveting as Hackman's devoted assistant, a man of maniacal determination.",No Way Out
23,slightlymad22,Kevin Costner's Best Performance So Far.,9,11 August 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to No Way Out from 1987.Plot In A Paragraph: Lt. Cdr. Tom Farrell (KC) is a naval officer assigned to newly appointed Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman). When there is a murder, he gets caught up in a life or death situation.No Way Out is a superior thriller, that I personally think is brilliant, and I'm constantly surprised that so few people have seen it. We have seen the main character of a movie being innocent, despite all the evidence saying he is guilty a million times before. But the idea of a man running an investigation that, unless he can uncover evidence to the contrary, will lead ultimately to his own destruction is genius. The story is so tight, and the performances are so good, I found myself really caught up in the movie and really cared about the characters. That's always the sign of a great thriller, when you care about the characters. It's well directed, well acted, has some unbelievable tension (claustrophobic at times) and a couple of cool twists (including one I never seen coming when I first saw it) that constantly keep you on your toes, and the way it all comes together at the end is nothing short as brilliant. We have had a Quirky Costner (Fandango) Cowboy Costner (Silverado) and Serious Costner (The Untouchables) here we get two Costner's for the price of one!! An Action Costner and a Sexy Costner. KC's performance is a lot more complex than his previous work, and for me, it's the best performance of his career so far. I think it's perfect casting. A lot depends on his ability to convince us that he is facing some truly dangerous dilemmas and his performance is excellent.Gene Hackman (maybe Hollywood's most consistent performer) does what he does. Will Patton is brilliant, and is clearly the inspiration for Smithers and his adoration/devotion to Mr Burns in The Simpsons. We also get a good supporting performance from George Dzundza too. One of the movies flaws is the 80's electro soundtrack is a little over used. I could have easily given this movie a 10/10",No Way Out

26,videorama-759-859391,"No way, should you miss this one",8,16 June 2014,"Hot on the heels of The Untouchables, came the next Costner pic. 5 weeks to be exact. No Way Out is one of those exciting thrillers, in many a moon, if with only a slow lead up to the accidental murder of Hackman's mistress (Young), by the man himself, where a hard slap sends her over a balustrade, to her death. Naval seal officer, Tom Farrell (Costner) was making love with Young, prior, where Hackman's knock, was kind of his cue for getting the hell out of there. Hackman plays a powerful minister of defence who has his homosexual assistant, a fantastic Will Patton, do his dirty work for him, where a cover up comes into play, only Costner has been assigned to head the investigation, so he's pretty much dug himself into a grave. This situation of story structure is what makes the movie exciting, where the walls start to come closing in, and Costner feels only too obliged to really tell the other operatives about what really went down, but of course can't, for a few reasons. The car chase scene, that ends on foot was thrilling, where Costner tries to hinder some agents, who are about to uncover evidence that places Costner at the scene of the crime. It's these situations and others that make the film exciting. It's Will Patton who has to commended though, while Hackman adds slight menace. Too, we have the Q and A scenario, with Costner in too deep, defending himself, in the interrogation, which of course puts the other scenes in the before phase. Too again, I don't quite know how Hackman's fate ended. I'm pretty sure he died. I'll guess I'll have to watch this film again. I for one haven't got a problem with that. I guess my only gripe with this exciting espionage thriller, was just the little too long, start, involving the getting to know you stuff, between Costner and Young who get very cozy, as shown in that montage. This plays against the title song, where too Costner and friend live it up The Philippines, in some play/off time, amongst some dancing titties. But this much earlier screen time shared, between our lovebirds, did make her tragic death, more effective. Recommended highly, before Costner went on to make those trifle batch of three hour, bore to death flicks.",No Way Out
27,robert-temple-1,Superior Pentagon Cold War spy thriller,9,30 September 2010,"This is a nail-biting thriller which holds up to repeated viewing, even if you know the surprise ending. The film is unaccountably said to be based on the earlier film THE BIG CLOCK (1948, see my review), but has little resemblance to it. In this film, there is a lockdown of the Pentagon and it is sealed off as a room by room search takes place for a spy, who can only be identified by outsiders who have previously set eyes on him. I was once inside the Pentagon and can tell you that it is so immense that such a search would take weeks, in my opinion, if it were even possible at all, and I really do not believe it to be remotely possible. (Many rooms in the Pentagon could never be entered by outside people for any reason, which is another point overlooked in the film.) But never mind, this is a movie, and this lockdown and search idea is taken from THE BIG CLOCK where this process takes place inside a New York office building of a magazine empire owned by the character played by Charles Laughton. The other point of contact between the two films is the central plot premise that 'the bad powerful man', in this case the Secretary of Defence, played by Gene Hackman, has accidentally murdered his mistress and tries to pin it on an aide, played by Kevin Costner. (In the other film, Ray Milland is the fall guy.) The mistress who gets murdered (which is a pity, because she was the most watchable character) in this film is brilliantly played by Sean Young, who gives the liveliest performance in the film. She exudes such significant amounts of allure that the screen is splashed with it. She has created a nervy, jumpy, character who positively revels in the atmosphere of corrupt power and glamour of the top DC folk, and sex in the Secretary of Defence's private limousine with his aide is very much the thing. Power usually goes to people's heads, but in this instance the anatomical areas of arousal are elsewhere. And as we know from Bill Clinton and Monica, those areas are the prime movers of Washington events in any case, since so many Washington heads are dead inside anyway, and only the lower organs any longer function. Fred Thompson, later a US Senator from Tennessee, plays the CIA Director in this film. Howdy y'all, always so nice to see you on screen, and do have some collard greens! One of the most amusing things about American movies is the way fantasy and reality become one continuum and it is hard to tell them apart.

Kevin Costner (rarely out of his glistening white uniform) portrays a Pentagon naval officer assigned by the Secretary of Defense to investigate the murder of the Secretary's mistress (who was Costner's lover as well), and complications arise after the bewildered officer begins to find all the evidence pointing to himself as the primary suspect. It's all an elaborate frame-up, of course, but because the true identity of the killer is never in question the film has to rely instead on routine (and often gratuitous) doses of violence and sex to hold the viewer's interest (and bring the story up to date from its original 1947 setting). Costner plays a refreshingly fallible hero, and the government corruption sub-plot is certainly topical, but the illogical and unnecessary epilogue comes close to spoiling the rest of the film, by adding one plot twist too many to an already cluttered scenario.",No Way Out

Not a bad formula, really, and one which should be done considering the corruption of people in power. Hackman plays the big shot who commits murder, and there's a goofy yes man who tries to cover it up, and of course two assassins.

The hero has a roundabout way of trying to save one woman's life from the assassins, and not the best way to do it successfully. A lot of the plot works, but a lot of it doesn't work. This movie could have been better considering Hackman and Costner were in it.

In spite of that, I didn't love it though it's tough to say exactly why. The best I can do is say that, the movie while not lacking a sense of intrigue, was at times very dull. The buildup is extremely slow, your waiting a bit to long for real tension to set in, and although it's very exciting at times it never reaches the on the edge of your seat excitement until the very end.I was, however, very impressed with the acting in this, everyone was perfectly cast, and it remained interesting enough to keep watching but I did think it was Just a bit overrated(I have heard this described as one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.)While I definitely do not think it was that, The IMDb rating of a perfect 7, is probably about right.SPOILERS:I was a bit baffled by the ending which I may never understand completely.

I believe this was where he scored his first break as a talented action star with his sexy and heart throb good looks. The cover up story is very nerve racking that you can really feel the suspense around it. The movie runs for almost 2 hours and it takes you around the Washington DC area & the Pentagon and is worth watching over & over again. The chronology of episodes really intensifies the viewers until the whole cover up explodes at the climax. The movie also ignites with passion, as Kevin Costner fell for the Secretary of Foreign Affair's mistress played by Sean Young. Of course, Gene Hackman, one of the all time best actors around, also played a good role as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Sex & politics is just a hot topic of our times and in the coming November 2000 elections especially when loyalty and integrity and devotion to your job & countrymen come into play. That's what this movie stirs some criticisms but not this extreme.Fast-paced, suspenseful, and exhibiting all the aspects of a classic Soviet-era spy game drama, ""No Way Out"" will have you poised on the edge of your seat. The story is really well done & shines in the movie. The camera-work is really good, as is the music, special effects, & the pacing, but the pacing is uneven at spots but generally well done.

39,Luigi Di Pilla,Too overrated,5,10 July 2006,I think NO WAY OUT is not an intelligent thriller because the story is too predictable and slow paced in the first part. The scenery of the Pentagon house got me nearly sick and the music was very poor too. They could have done more but perhaps all these elements weren't ready in the late 80s to be developed on a higher level or the writer and the director failed completely. I remember only some good thrillers from the 80s such as THE EYES OF THE NEEDLE or TERMINATOR. Then I think that it was far away from a clever espionage thriller. I mean I cannot consider NO WAY OUT as a timeless movie cause here you watch it once and that'a all except you like one of the actors. If you like Kevin Costner then see it but if you are looking for more suspense and thrills skip it. I recommend instead THIRTEEN DAYS from the same director and with Kevin Costner in the main role.

40,DeeNine-2,This is one of the best thrillers I ever saw,10,20 May 2017,"I didn't see this when it came out in 1987 which is just as well because I really enjoyed seeing it the other night. It's a political thriller with Gene Hackman as David Brice, U.S. Secretary of Defense. Brice employs the kind of political machinations usually seen in corrupt congresspersons as he tries to wiggle his way out of a terrible jam. At his side is the particularly sleazy sociopathic Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) who defends his boss with true devotion.Okay what makes this so good? I mean Sean Young is to die for pretty of course and Kevin Costner is just the kind of guy few women can resist. So we've got good eye candy, but what makes ""No Way Out"" head and shoulders above almost all other thrillers is the oh so ingenious plot. Yes the plot in this movie is very clever—some might say too clever, especially the ending which some viewers may feel is unlikely or tacked on. It is a doozy of an ending and it follows some mesmerizing twists and turns along the way. I found most of them plausible, and I think the only thing wrong with the ending was Kevin Costner's accent! The screen play was adapted from Kenneth Fearing's novel ""The Big Clock"" which I haven't read. There was also a movie with the same title from 1948 starring Ray Milland, Maureen O'Sullivan, and Charles Laughton. I do know that while ""No Way Out"" is about the Pentagon and the intrigue centers around the secretary of defense and a naval officer, Commander Tom Farrell (Costner) ""The Big Clock"" was about a publishing tycoon. Apparently what is the same is some kind of similar action removed from the backdrops.I find most thrillers have too many plot holes and implausibilities while relying too heavily on action and chase scenes, car crashes, etc. Here most of the chase scenes are on foot. What made me decide to take a look at this was to see the young Sean Young again. Who could forget all the close-ups of her face in ""Blade Runner"" (1982).By the way, the title ""No Way Out"" is especially apt since it really does look like neither Brice nor Farrell have any way out. The plot is that diabolical.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion""",No Way Out
41,punishmentpark,"Incoherent cocktail with a twist, but not all bad.",4,17 October 2013,"I'm sure I have seen 'No Way Out' at least once before, but I didn't remember more than up to the part when Sean Young's character falls to her death... so it was a pretty big surprise that Costner's character turned out to be Ivan. Not that it made much sense with all the things (nót) leading up to this finale, nor did this twist have much impact. I'd recommend 'The Usual Suspects' if you want to see one that does pull it off.The rest of the film is a rather incoherent mix of spiced up romance, intrigue, backstabbing, action and half-assed developments - although it is fun at times just to have a laugh with (The Simpsons could have a good laugh with it - isn't that Will Patton playing Mr. Smithers here?). The acting is pretty okay, though Costner has never been nor will he ever be a favorite of mine. Then there is the showing off with neat shots of Washington (near the Pentagon - for example when Hackman's character is having breakfast with the Washington Monument behind him) and such.Not a great one, nor even a good one, but entertaining at times if not taken too seriously. 4 out of 10.",No Way Out
42,seymourblack-1,"Murder, Intrigue & Espionage",8,30 April 2011,"This excellent thriller is essentially a reworking of John Farrow's ""The Big Clock"" (1948) and both movies were based on Kenneth Fearing's novel of the same name. ""No Way Out"" is full of intrigue and surprises (even for those who are familiar with the 1948 film) and commendably does a great deal more than simply choosing to replicate its predecessor. By transferring the action from a publishing company in New York to the Pentagon (in Washington) it increases the scope for creating even more conspiracies and double dealing and in some ways also sets the stakes higher.Following an act of heroism at sea, Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is transferred to Washington to undertake duties at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, David Brice (Gene Hackman). Initially, Farrell is given the task of acting as a liaison between Brice and the CIA.Farrell's aware that his lover, Susan Atwell (Sean Young) is also involved with another man and one evening when he's leaving her apartment, sees the other man (who happens to be Brice) who's just about to enter the property. Brice, having seen someone in the shadows (and not realising that it's Farrell), becomes furious with Susan and during the ensuing argument hits her and causes her to fall over a balcony to her death.Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) is an old friend of Farrell's and also Brice's loyal assistant. When his boss indicates that he's ready to admit his part in Susan's death, Pritchard tries desperately to dissuade him from taking that course of action and suggests that they should organise a cover-up and implicate someone else as the culprit.Pritchard cleans up all the surfaces in Susan's apartment which may have fingerprints on them, removes any items which could be used as evidence and then invents a story that Susan's other lover was a Soviet spy called Yuri. It had long been rumoured that there was a Russian spy in the Pentagon but no-one had ever seen him and so it was very uncertain whether he even existed.Farrell obviously knows who killed Susan and is subsequently put in charge of the investigation to find Yuri. Unfortunately, this puts him in a position where the information uncovered by his investigation is likely to point to his own guilt and he therefore has to embark on a frantic race against time to produce compelling evidence of the real killer's guilt before he finds himself condemned by the information produced by his own investigation.Kevin Costner has the right physique and clean cut looks for his part as a naval officer and he's also believable during the romantic episodes and in his interaction with colleagues at the Pentagon. However, it's during the passages where he's at his most energetic and when he feels most trapped that he really excels and it's at these times that his performance is most evocative of Ray Milland's in ""The Big Clock"".Gene Hackman is faultless as the politician who becomes very insecure because of the trouble he gets into as a result of his inability to control his intense levels of jealousy and anger and Sean Young is entertaining as the mysterious mistress with plenty of attitude.Will Patton provides the movie's most memorable performance as a real all-out villain who's fanatical in his loyalty to Brice and totally ruthless in taking whatever action is necessary to protect his boss.""No Way Out"" is a very involved story which features murder, espionage and the gross abuse of power. The action begins at a fairly leisurely pace but then very effectively continues to build until it becomes positively frenetic. Director Roger Donaldson skilfully creates a great deal of suspense and a claustrophobic atmosphere which helps to accentuate just how trapped Farrell feels. The chase sequences are very well choreographed and the plot contains some really neat twists which add enormously to the enjoyment of the piece.",No Way Out
43,blott2319-1,"Slow ramp up, but a decent thriller",6,23 August 2021,"No Way Out is a political thriller about a man who is hired to work for the Secretary of Defense, but he finds himself in a sticky situation that could lead to him being accused of treason and subsequently being killed. I do enjoy tense thrillers where the hero is stuck in a difficult position and has to continuously avoid being caught. They constantly keep you on your toes, and I love those moments where you don't know what he can do next. There were several times that I felt his way of stalling the inevitable in this film was a bit cheesy and unrealistic, but within the logic of the film it worked well enough. For the sake of avoiding spoilers I won't delve into how much more the logic breaks down by the end, but needless to say this isn't exactly the smartest movie I've ever seen, but that didn't stop the thrilling aspects from being fun to watch.What was less fun to watch was about the first 30 minutes or more of the film. This movie takes its time in setting things up, and exploring the romance between Kevin Costner and Sean Young. This kind of graphic detail isn't necessary for me, and I was starting to wonder if I was watching the right movie since it felt more like a romantic drama. There are certainly moments throughout all this courting that are important because they come back as things that might reveal the truth about Costner, but I didn't need the amount of time they spent detailing the romance just for those few small pieces of information. Once the inciting incident occurred, and the actual story got rolling, I had some good fun with No Way Out, I only wish they got us there sooner. No Way Out is still a decent movie, and one I might watch again to see how the story is changed by knowing how it ends.",No Way Out
44,hnt_dnl,Brilliant political film noir thriller,10,9 August 2020,"NO WAY OUT is a slick, classy political thriller from the 80s that holds up amazingly well. Essentially built on the foundation of a romantic triangle, the film is tight, tense and methodical with nonstop twists and turns. The writing, acting, pacing, and editing is top notch. It doesn't have that typical ""80s"" vibe that most films of that era tend to have.Kevin Costner superbly plays the film's protagonist Commander Tom Farrell, a Navy hero that gets a cushy Pentagon assignment as the top military advisor to the Defense Secretary David Brice, essayed by the legendary Gene Hackman in a typical terrific performance. Mr. Hackman is one of those actors who made every role seem effortless. I put him right up there with the likes of Marlon Brando as an all time great.While it's no secret that Hackman is considered one of the all time greats, in my extremely unpopular opinion, Costner has always been an exceptional actor. The more I re-watch this flick, the more I appreciate the subtlety and nuance in his acting. His performance holds this entertaining piece together. This film came out the same year as The Untouchables and Costner played 2 polar opposite characters who had opposite trajectories extremely well. While his Eliot Ness was a naive, unconfident pushover who slowly morphed into a take-no-prisoners survivor, his Tom Farrell starts out a cocky, confident, arrogant sailor whose world unravels and slowly loses his cool as the film progresses.The supporting cast is also excellent. Sean Young is in her absolute sexual prime as Susan Atwell, the center of the triangle as Farrell's girlfriend and Bryce's mistress. It seems like she was on her way to big things with this movie, had a couple of starring parts after this, then just disappeared from the movie scene altogether. But Will Patton may be the real find in this piece. At the time, a newcomer to film (I'd never seen him in anything prior to this), Patton is exceptional as Scott Pritchard, Brice's assistant and Tom's friend. Pritchard is a key player that really helps the plot move along.The film also boasts some strong character roles by Howard Duff, George Dzundza, Jason Bernard, Fred Thompson (an actual politician) and a surprisingly good performance by 80s supermodel Iman. There's not a single weak link in this engrossing thriller. Director Roger Donaldson put together a really intriguing political piece that remains very watchable 30 some odd years later.",No Way Out

The movie proceeds as expected . Still , the more you watch the movie the more your are dragged into the story . Roger Donaldson certainly directs it with confidence . In the end , when the last half of hour comes you will be rewarded by the story . There is both adrenaline and shock for you there.Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman deliver what you could expect from them. Costner is quite wooden , but tolerable . Hackman is good . If you seen him in ""Absolute power"" you won't be surprised by his performance here. George Dzundza gives a memorable performance as a scientist on a wheelchair.Two persons steal the show . Sean Young hasn't got too much screen time, yet she fills the movie with energy and vulnerability when she's on screen. Will Patton gives the best performance of the movie as a man dedicated to Hackman . He's two-faced , cold , cynical and ruthless. A nomination for Oscar would do him justice.I give it 7/10 . Watch it . You won't regret it . The final is worth watching itself. Mind blowing.",No Way Out
47,RonellSowes,One Of The Few Films That Continues To Heighten,7,24 October 2021,"The best and worst qualities of Now Way Out are the same thing, its pace. The first act feels more like the first half and is redundant in the way it just continues to cover the same ground after it's already established what it needs to. But once it kicks into action any dullness quickly evaporates from what is definetly one of the more tense and high-octane thrillers out there. The film's 'ticking clock' is utilized very well and the plot manages to build even when you might think its reached its limit. Placing Costner in a situation that really appears to have no way out of. The film certainly isn't perfect, but I'll say it's difficult to find a similar movie that attempts to do what this one does better.",No Way Out
48,vostf,Another noir story with 80s lighting,5,12 November 2010,"Main assets, in my preference order, are:the outdated blurry 80s style -- not a definite period, ugly colors, funny hairdos, cold war sci-fi...;the cast (Kostner, Hackman, Sean Young);the finale, adapted from The Big Clock.As with Joe Eszterhas' scripts (starting with Jagged Edge, released 1985), the storyline is a treat on first viewing. You really think it's a darn good movie. On second viewing I'd say it's pretty slow, nothing much builds up before we're getting really close to the Grand Finale. For instance the love story is only a way to delay the start and doesn't help the story to pick up. Love? Jealousy? Secret service? Cold war? Conspiracy? It's a strange mixture only made watchable by a very good cast.As for the comparison with The Big Clock let's say it falls into the general case of mismatching a noir story with a sunny pastel 80s ambiance. Basically, as with the D.O.A. remake starring Dennis Quaid, this appears to be a photography issue. Not the DP's fault. No producer would have thought of making a wide audience flick with noir-style lighting in the 80s. But the way the Grand Finale is handled is at fault too. In addition to the erratic rhythm, we can blame that one on the director. How would such a theoretically rivetingly suspenseful climax work in a setting that's not made to look labyrinthine and claustrophobic? That is the biggest flaw of the movie. Had Roger Donaldson (Australian-born, as James Farrow who directed the original) done it right he could have ended this movie on a high mark. Instead, No Way Out goes on with a uselessly dull epilogue that further cripples the movie.In my opinion, only worth watching if you're interested by some of the above. Beyond this analytical aspect it's only a very forgettable movie.",No Way Out

There are too many flaws, to many unanswered questions, too many inconsistencies... The premise in itself would have been acceptable, but everything else seems to have been inserted without any thought, without any prior research, even without common sense in my opinion. The resulting situations are sometimes even funny, bordering on the grotesque, which definitely cannot be considered as a plus for a thriller which appears to take itself seriously. And then there is the ending... (no comment)All in all, a below average movie.",No Way Out
51,romanorum1,An Innocent Man Investigates Himself,7,4 August 2017,"US Navy Lt. Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) is a Pentagon officer assigned to the personal staff of the scheming Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman). At a formal ball in Washington DC, Farrell is first introduced to Brice through the latter's fanatically devoted general council, Scott Pritchard (Will Patton). Exhibiting the most suggestive body language at the ball, sexy Susan Atwell (Sean Young) also meets Farrell. As their chemistry immediately clicks, they have a quick tryst; the sex scene in the limo is fairly noteworthy. Although Atwell is the mistress of the married Brice, her affair with Farrell continues for several months. Meanwhile Brice has as a chief rival, Senator Duvall (Howard Duff), who wants the Secretary of Defense to approve of the ""Phantom Submarine,"" which is the size of an aircraft carrier. Brice is against the proposed project because the sub's huge size will make it easy for the Soviet Russian enemy to detect. Knowing that his lover has been with another man, Brice confronts her in the apartment that he has paid for her. In a jealous rage he strikes her so hard that she falls backward over the balcony railing, striking the lower level and breaking her neck. In a panic, Brice calls his devoted servant Pritchard, who masterminds a plan to protect his boss from scandal and pin the crime on someone else. Pritchard's plan is to search for a supposed mole in the Defense Department: a Russian spy sent by the Soviet KGB to America while young and who can pass as a real American. His code name is ""Yuri."" Pritchard's stratagem is to blame Atwell's death on this fictional lover ""Yuri"" and thus deflect attention away from the Secretary of Defense. Of course it was Farrell who had just left Atwell's apartment before Brice arrived and killed her. Farrell knows the killer has to be Brice. As Pritchard needs a front man, navy officer Farrell, who performed a heroic act at sea, is chosen. While the CID (Criminal Investigation Division of Army Intelligence) removes items from Atwell's apartment, Farrell is somewhat suspicious as he is ordered to report only to Brice or Pritchard, and to avoid the FBI, CIA, or the Washington Police. In a short time Farrell will realize that the criminal investigation will lead to him as the fall guy. The clues, though untainted, are all stacked against him!Kevin O'Brien (Leon Russom) of the FBI is suspicious, though, of the motives of the Brice team. When an associate says that Atwell was the mistress of either Brice or Pritchard, O'Brien retorts, ""Pritchard is homosexual!"" Then Senator Duvall comes into Brice's office to do business on his pet project, the proposed submarine. Pritchard makes a vague promise to him, to get him away. Meanwhile Farrell is convinced of the cover-up. He says to Pritchard that even if ""Yuri"" exists, he did not murder Atwell! Farrell tries to quit the investigation but is without success. In the denouement, the Brice team has brought two witnesses into the Pentagon building. So, as the workers begin to leave their jobs for the day, all of the exits are sealed except for the main one. The witnesses are on the watch for ""Yuri."" Once the building has emptied out, it's floor to floor, and room to room. How can Farrell escape? At the very end there is a huge twist that you will not see coming! Although it is a military setting, ""No Way Out"" owes much to ""The Big Clock"" (1948), where magazine journalist Ray Milland is framed by powerful publishing tycoon Charles Laughton for the murder of the latter's mistress. Laughton, like Hackman's Brice, doesn't really know the identity of the innocent man that he is framing. Milland, like Costner, is picked to lead an investigation against himself. The actors all do well in ""No Way Out,"" with Costner and Patton taking the top honors with their electrifying performances. Filming locations were in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. See this movie because it's a good one!",No Way Out

Its also probably Kevin Costner's only credible performance. Gene Hackman is excellent, Sean Young isnt great, but she was good for her part. The score adds to the suspense in the movie as well. This is one of the few films that actually gave me chills! Surprisingly enough its directed by the usually mediocre director Roger Donaldson(Cadillac Man, Cocktail), but he got lucky with this one.

53,B24,Should Be Remade as a Silent Movie,3,14 July 2003,"Come to think of it, that could be said of most of Costner's films.  It would constitute a major and immediate improvement.  He is like an early star of Westerns, a Tom Mix or William S. Hart kind of guy, a stock hero surrounded by visual clues as to what's happening and why. His thin and reedy monotone is entirely unnecessary, especially when coupled with his inability to read lines properly.*Spoiler Alert* Not quite as bad as his over-screen narration in ""Dances With Wolves,"" Costner's delivery is rendered nowhere as ludicrous, however, as in the final scene of this 1987 pale imitation of ""The Big Clock.""  I think I laughed out loud when he revealed his ""true"" identity as a Russian.  It was so totally over the top and absurd I could summon no effort at generous or willing suspension of disbelief.As others have pointed out, the chase scenes are equally implausible.  I was particularly annoyed by the inclusion of a non-existent Metro stop in Georgetown, where I happened to be living at the time I first saw this film in 1988.  Poetic license does not mean carte blanche when it comes to contemporary portrayal of real places or events.I would leave the musical score intact, I guess.  Then it would rise to a 6 out of 10.

54,rollernerd,Watch our for Yuri,6,7 August 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the thriller No Way Out (1987) starring the likeable Costner as Tom Farrell, navy officer who gets posted at the Pentagon and is working for the Secretary of Defence Brice played by the legend himself Gene Hackman. Farrell soon starts a love affair with mysterious Susan Atwell played by Sean Young aka Finkle for you Ace Ventura fans. What Farrell soon finds out is that Atwell is also the mistress of Brice and when Brice finds out that Atwell is seeing someone behind his back (not know its Farrell) he accidently murders her. What happens next is a cover up and a witch hunt to find the killer who is supposedly believed to be a KGB mole. The whole KGB Russian stuff - why?? Anyways, Farrell has plays around the clock to play the hunter even though he is the prey while trying to figure out how to clear his name. An interesting thriller with an interesting twist at the end however the story to me along with some of the acting wasn't the best. Firstly its Hackman, he just changes his character tone from being all mighty at the beginning to a softy in the middle and in the end somewhere got the cajunes to set up a diabolical story - it didn't mesh up. And the dynamic between Hackman and Will Patton's character Pritchard was weird as - it's like Mr. Burns and Smithers from The Simpsons and in the story literally the latter loves the former, but the former is too powerful and naive to ever notice. Another weird part was the introduction of the KGB, maybe it's the 80s therefore it's the Cold War element, but bringing up this sub plot which really becomes the main plot didn't fit with the tone of the film. The cool part of the flick is when Costner runs around trying to eliminate evidence before anyone finds out while also trying to hide away from key eye witnesses. But what I didn't understand is if this bloke is who he is, how on earth did he get to be Pritchard's mate during their tour and schooling? Didn't add up. Overall, there are few pleasant twists, particularly the very end however it's not a great movie by any means but still enjoyable - 6/10.",No Way Out

I have seen this movie many times, and Siskel and Ebert had the same trouble I did when I first saw it. The ending seemed to make no sense. Actually, the ending is the whole point. The murder has nothing to do with Cold War politics. It was simply the rage of the Secretary of Defense over suspicions that someone else was seeing his lover. The whole farce is that the whole murder is turned into a political situation where they suspect the perpetrator is a Russian spy. Costner is completely innocent, but spends the rest of the movie trying to throw the scent off his tracks. At the very end of the movie Costner's character is being grilled by the KGB. He is a double agent, but that is irrelevant. The KGB now sees him as a liability and abandons him. Such a brilliant plot.",No Way Out

Sean Young is the tragic figure who falls for Costner and sets in motion the wheels that make this picture one of the best of its type. Plot twists and suspense are highlighted by great acting, and as the cover-up unravels, Costner finds himself in increasing danger in the halls of the Pentagon. Will Patton and George Dzunda are solid in support of the leads although Patton is a bit over the top as Hackman's attack dog. This fine film is marred by an ending that doesn't connect with the film's plot or pulse and gives the picture an awkward, unsatisfying conclusion.

If you go chasing guys through the halls, they are going to put you IN the wall, and THEN ask what you're doing. I guess that's the point, though. Most people don't know what the pentagon is really like. Where were the Washington DC Metro Police? There's no way they would not have run their own investigation into the death of Sean Young. Were they just going to leave this investigation to the Secretary of Defense's office? A uniformed naval officer being chased by 2 guys in suits through the halls of the pentagon?

60,xbrad68,What if Kevin Costners character really works for America,9,22 June 2005,No Way Out is a cold war thriller that makes Kgb moles look ominous. I think the former Kgb is called the FSB now. I took a Canadian Forces Special Service Force Military Intelligence Course so I know about Russia and China. There is now a Brazil Russia India China South Africa alliance known as Brics for short. My advice is to not make fun of their spys and to avoid them. The film is directed by Roger Donaldson who makes the Pentagon scenes feel claustrophobic. Kevin Costner plays Tom Farrell a Navy Lieutenant Commander who has a fling with Sean Youngs character not realizing that she is the mistress of Defense Secretary David Brice played very well by Gene Hackman. Kostners character is put in charge of finding the killer of Sean Youngs character. It is rumored that the killer is a KGB mole. Farrell must hurry to find the killer because a poloroid negative of him and Youngs character found at the crime scene will be made visible again in a few hours. Imagine if President Jack Kennedy had people made American vice president for a day and the practice continued indefinitely. there would now be tens of thousands of former vice presidents that the Brics alliance would have to leave alone. I should claim to be a former American vice president so that Chinese and Russian spys would leave me alone.

61,andrewrye-06535,Too Many Flaws,6,13 May 2019,"I usually don't mind the odd flaw as long as the movie mostly carries it off. This one almost did but the ending ruined most of the movie.This is one of Kevin Costner's finer performances in my opinion although one of his first as a lead. He showed emotion which in later movies wasn't apparent. He played the jealous lover pretty well and Gene Hackman did a great job as usual in a part he normally plays, a senior Government Official (Defense Secretary) with a secret mistress. Will Patton seamlessly held the story together as the main protagonist and protector of the Defense Secretary's reputation. The homosexual overtones and affection for the DS were well played and so subtle as you could believe Gene Hackman's character wouldn't have picked up on it. Sean Young played her character a little OTT but this can be forgiven as I've noticed 80's movies tended to do this a lot and she was her usual brilliant self.At times I felt the manic pace it built up was close to the action in 'Out of Time' (the one with Denzel Washington) but nicely constrained. The story was good, basically Defense Secretary (Hackman) accidentally kills his mistress (Young) and a cover up is conjured up by his secretary (Patton) using a cold war theme of a spy in the pentagon. Newly appointed Intelligence liaison (Costner) is put in charge of the investigation to find said spy who is blamed for the death. Costner started a relationship with Young which was unknown to Hackman. Read the review on IMDB to get to know more.The problem was that there was no reason for the spy Yuri to kill Young. For this to be connected to the Pentagon a connection with the DS (or other high official) would need to be established and it wasn't. No one knew of the affair. And (SPOILER ALERT - you need to have seen the movie for the next pieces) at the end when Costner is exposed as a Russian Agent there was no reason given for why he was ordered to start the affair with Young. If it was for information from Hackman's character (as Defense Secretary) he never asked her anything which may have been a state secret. Up until his outing as a spy Costner acted like the jealous lover for no reason. He even tried to get her to break up with him which would be contrary to what a Russian spy would want. There was also a mention that Russia wasn't impressed by the Philippine's bag smuggled out with his underwear in it (when the young boy took off with his bag). What was supposed to be in it and was it for the Russians or for Young?I guess I feel a little cheated that the story wasn't told well. Costner didn't do anything to suggest he was a plant by the Russians - so no WOW moment and even after finding out, there was no suggestion he was after any state secrets although the Submarine information may have been it, it wasn't obvious and it didn't come through the mistress but through normal channels and was played down.Anyway, a middling movie with a questionable story line deserves a middling mark. Did I like it? Did I not? - a 5 from me.",No Way Out
62,CihanVercan,The second Populist formula of Men In Uniform romance segments after Top-Gun,7,30 June 2010,"A naval officer becomes a hero after rescuing his ship crew from a whirlpool in Atlantic. By means of his international intelligence service experience -which is hidden in story until the ending- he's hired by a job in Pentagon to work as an assistant of National Defense minister. Through KGB connections the defence ministry gives him a top secret mission to exterminate a CIA funding operation called The Phantom Submarine, but to let the media know what's going on, his heroic rescue is being shown to cloak the facts with KGB.Though it's a remake of Yves Montand's Police Python and John Farrow's The Big Clock, this film offers couple surprises and endless suspense. Compare it with the best movies of 1987, Timothy Dalton's James Bond flick ""The Living Daylights"" or Charlie Sheen's ""Wall Street"" is not offering you anything as a surprising and twisted story. No Way Out possesses a sense of film noir from the post-modern world war-II era. For me in every aspect No Way Out comes before its comparisons if the consideration is onto plot, story, thriller, suspense.Those were the factors what makes No Way Out favoured and likable. But for professional audiences and concerns, first of all No Way Out has everything in common with the Film Noir age movies; a hero and his squeeze, he's growing suspect if she's on cheating him, suddenly she dies creating a twist in the story, hero runs after to solve the mystery of her death, as simple as that. It doesn't have an effective drama plot or no good sub-plots. The only purpose is to sell more tickets. It has all the necessities for a populist production, but doesn't reflect any messages, it doesn't tell nothing to the viewer. Things happen and we watch it with excitement, wondering what's gonna happen next, that's all. The filming and directing dexterity as a whole production is what the main problem is. No wonder why no awards for this movie.Considering Redford & Dunaway's ""Three Days of The Condor(1975)"", I expected to see better intelligence bureau movies in 1980s and 1990s. But not until 21st century you come across another good governmental crime. After the death of the leading actress in the film, the romance segment ends off, then we're stuck in the Pentagon, watching things happening between CIA, NSA and KGB all trying to give an end to a scandal before it rises. If you're looking to find a good crime film, you're in the wrong place.I will finish up with what I liked most in No Way Out. It's a great popcorn movie, a perfect choice for having fun with family or with spouse/girlfriend. Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman together enhances the viewing quality. One of the best movies of Kevin Costner, and includes some memorable moments of him with his female cast-mate. Just for its moments of romance its better than Top Gun. Remember Top Gun was half-a-romance movie, this was even one-third in length. 1980s was the generation when all the women in the world dreamt and fantasized of MEN IN UNIFORM.",No Way Out
63,lizziebeth-1,Garland's scope is astounding; the film that launched Costner's career--for good reason.(9/10),9,19 October 2007,"20yrs ago Kiwi Director Roger Donaldson was already at the top of his game, as were a young, lean and athletic Kevin Costner, and Mace Neufeld, future uber-producer of technothrillers. Costner is therefore perfectly cast in this political melodrama/ spy thriller by Ilene Starger as Commander Tom Farrell of ONI (Office of ""Naval Int"", not ""Navel lint""). The movie is based primarily on Kenneth Fearing's book The Big Clock, NOT the 1947 Charles Laughton film, as Leonard Maltin claims. Only the Pentagon net scene was remade from that.Writer/Producer Robert Garland's screenplay straddles an amazing scope, moving from Washington intrigue to sexy melodrama-by-way-of naval adventure and technothriller(!). Unfortunately, it's bookended by a spy molehunt for a ""Yuri"" in the Pentagon, so its twist ending is a strain that the rest does little to support. It's unlikely that Garland botched his screenplay adaptation of his own story; he--or Donaldson--simply didn't seed enough inconsistencies. This resulted in a seemingly ludicrous ending.A similar device was used far more successfully in The Sixth Sense(1999), where the reinterpretation was better-justified even emotionally, so audiences were intrigued and touched by their ""perspective shift"", rather than annoyed.Thankfully NWO features two overwhelmingly attractive leads. Neither Costner, dapper and athletic even as he dramatically bleeds into his Navy whites, nor Sean Young, all busty-gold-lame as a jaded chippy sleeping her way to the top, ever looked so good. Their scenes together ground (or is it ""grind""?) the movie in considerable honesty under all the Washington decadence. They sizzle through NWO's infamous ""Washington monument"" scene.Costner is arguably the best he's ever been as the vulnerable naval hero perpetually embarrassed by his ""exotic"" lover. In fact, his character's charisma probably derails the ending. For her part, Sean Young (Blade Runner(1982)) is his match as Susan Atwell, the bitchy cynic who to her own surprise rediscovers her innocence by falling in love with him. Sadly, she's an object of lust for more than one man, and the other one kills her in a fit of jealousy.Her killer is Defence Secretary David Brice (Gene Hackman, adhering to the Hollywood aphorism that there are only two kinds of movies: ones with Gene Hackman, and ones without). Brice just happens to be Farrell's new boss at the Pentagon.The plot really takes off once it falls to Farrell, as Pentagon liaison to the CIA, to pin the murder on ""Yuri"", the supposed mole that Brice calls ""the CIA's wet dream"". For Brice, the ""molehunt"" conveniently steers the murder investigation away from himself.""Yuri"" is a thinly-veiled reference to an actual 1960s molehunt initiated by the real-life Yuri Nosenko. Since the real mole was never found, many think that it really was just ""the CIA's wet dream"". This deep background hints at why NWO goes so awry at the end; although Farrell's hurried call from the public phonebooths IS to his handler. This is the only seeding Garland granted us for the mole plot. The ""when you passed the bag of underwear, Moscow wasn't amused"" line near the end is already too late--we consider Farreell one of us, and no going back.Brice and his searingly obsessed, corrupt lackey Pritchard(Patton) cook up this bogus manhunt, blithely forcing Farrell to seize control the investigation, officially conducted by the Pentagon's Criminal Investigations Division, even as evidence points increasingly to Farrell himself. The judiciously impartial-looking Jason Bernard is pitch-perfect as the CID's Major Donovan, as he clues-in to the wild goose-chase.The screenplay successfully paints Commander Farrell as independent, apolitical, and well-liked by everyone not trying to ingratiate themselves with his boss. Unfortunately, it's this very American likability that guarantees we'll deny his possible guilt as a plant. Farrell's friends include the Pentagon's chief computer programmer, Sam Hesselman (the avuncular, rotund George Dzundza stuck in a wheelchair), whose tragic demise here is as much a viewer's bodyblow as Art Evans' was in Metro(1997). It's heartbreaking watching Sam draw the wrong conclusion about Farrell--or more accurately, about Pritchard.As Pritchard, Will Patton looms oppressively. He made a strong impression on Costner as well, who 10yrs later starred opposite him (even more confrontationally) in The Postman(1997).There are a couple of real-life ironies, though. The two goons ""associated with Special Forces"" whom Farrell and the movie are so distrustful of are supposed to be ""Iran-Contra"" hit men. This Reaganite scandal plays nicely into NWO's revisionism about a supposed Communist mole. It just succeeds too well.The other is the presence of Fred Dalton Thompson, who 20yrs later is running for President! Thompson (Hunt for Red October(1990)), past real-life Special Counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence(!) ventured into acting and became an instant hit, mostly in technothrillers. He's again wryly memorable here as the CIA Director to whom Farrell addresses his bloodied evidence.While Garland took care of the storytelling CONsistencies (there's the flaw), the director's attention to the acting detail is staggering. He always uses the takes with the happiest accidents, and the most unmasked reaction-shot closeups, including when his actors blush (watch Patton fulminate), retch (Costner), and retort tetchily (his dimples virtually speak for him when Jason Bernard says ""I was about to send my men"").The only production element that for my money fails is the opening credits' font design. It's what passed for 1980s computer ""wow"", but it jarrs badly against Maurice Jarre's hauntingly eerie original score.No Way Out(1987) found a smart, sassy yet cynical 1980s tone thanks to Roger Donaldson and a certain future Tom Clancy uber-producer. Neufeld's son also stints as co-Producer with the fabulous Laura Ziskin, having negotiated partial access for shooting inside the Pentagon.It's a shame that the movie's poorly-seeded ending was allowed to throw us into denial. It forces the movie to bite off more than even this superpower plot could chew.(9/10)",No Way Out
64,filmklassik,The way out ... is through better scripting,7,31 May 2018,"Ordinary crime film masquerading as Cold War spy thriller. Costner plays an ambitious young Naval officer thrilled at the chance to be working for Defense Secretary Hackman. What Costner doesn't know is, Hackman is the sugar daddy of the woman he's been sleeping with - Sean Young. When Hackman kills Young in a fit of rage, he and his aide (Will Patton) cook up a plan: They'll float a story that Young was murdered by a legendary (and possibly non-existent) Soviet spy named Yuri who, rumor has it, has infiltrated the highest levels of D.C. power, and they'll put Costner in charge of flushing him out. When Costner's investigation proves fruitless (as it must), Young's death will go down as just another tragedy in the annals of Cold War intrigue.But things aren't what they seem...Fine acting by Hackman (of course), Costner and Patton can't overcome the ridiculous story contrivances, starting with Costner and Young going at it in the back of a limo less than 5 minutes after they meet. (Sorry, kids, but that simply doesn't happen in the real world).The dialogue is hit and miss. Sometimes it's witty - and sometimes you cringe:YOUNG: ""Send me postcards from your exotic ports of call. That's what they call them, isn't it - exotic ports of call?""COSTNER: ""A port's a port. You're exotic.""There's a twist at the end that is 1) set up deftly and honestly in the early going, and 2) has absolutely nothing to do with the main mystery. The movie doesn't need it. Indeed, the novel this film is based on, ""The Big Clock"" by Kenneth Fearing, doesn't even have it, and it works just fine. 7 out of 10.",No Way Out
65,sickofenjoyingmyself,Solid thriller with some excellent performances,7,19 August 2016,As I watched No Way Out I realised that I had distant memories of having watched and enjoyed this before at some point in my youth. I hoped as it progressed it would hold up and still be as enjoyable - it was. As a thriller it is very satisfying. There are some excellent performances all around. Costner and Young were both great - although almost over the top cheesy at times. Patton and Hackman were exceptional in their sinister performances. They really made this work as at times the story line verged a little on the ridiculous side and you couldn't help but wonder at the credibility of some of the characters decisions. There are some extremely fast paced and tense action scenes such as the chase scene and the building search scene that really are edge of your seat stuff. As the film continues the pace grows and grows until it explodes into a frenetic and frenzied outcome. Just when you think it's all done and dusted the final scene reveals the biggest shock of all. Personally I did like the twist - but think that it could have been done more subtly and effectively. Overall verdict: solid 80's corruption thriller with some excellent acting that gave the story weight and made it work.,No Way Out

A few days ago, i've found this movie on CD.. it only cost RM 1(about half a dollar). Quite cheap right?? Haha...but i'm not about to talk about the price. What am I going to talk is about the quality of the movie. Actually i hate movies which contain porn...and i have to say that this movie quite boring and slow.. It doesn't mean that this is a poor movie, but it is probably one of the best thriller movie i've ever seen! Costner has never won any Oscar until in the middle of 90's where he won best actor and director in Dances With The Wolves. He has been good in his previous movie such as Untouchables and Jfk. Still he did not get any Oscar..actually he didn't has any luck. To me, he is far much more better than Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves, Nicholas Cage, Tom Cruise and many others! I can't believe that Cruise was given best actor for Born On the 4th of July! The film is OK, but the performance from Cruise is not great..shouldn't't be given for best actor...Costner have been performing very well in every movie..and he should be gaining an Oscar in some movies..and No Way Out is one of the best example!This movie quite slow enough..and it is very boring at the first 45 minutes. Then only the it started to be fantastic and dramatic when his lover was killed accidentally by Hackman, who has always been great in his movies. And there Will Patton who has been surprisingly showed that he was a great actor as a villain! There is not much action or firing bullets in this movie. It is more basically as a thriller drama..But the plot of the movie is great, and surely there are good scripts and suspense! Overall, this is truly a great movie!

68,GameAndWatch,Costnerphobia,5,21 October 2013,"It's a suspense thriller with the odd burst of action (though watching Costner run, doesn't really do it for me).Confused and stupid in places. The best device in the movie - the suspenseful claustrophobia - could have been worked more. The idea of having eyewitnesses parade up and down the Pentagon to flush out a spy was wholly silly. The ending, though totally disjointed, actually elevated the film and Costner's character. Despite the film's length nothing really happens. It's brainless.Only a few scenes have stuck in my mind. Sean Young's partial nudity and the eighties synthesizer soundtrack (Maurice Jarre) were the highlights of ultimately a very dull but surprisingly watch-able film.",No Way Out

A good thriller we are strong performances by Gene Hackman, Kevin Costner, Will Patton and George Dzundza. But I watch this movie now, I can't get over the realization that Sean Young's character is a total sl*t. She has already climbed the power ladder in Washington DC, now she just ""spreads"" for the first younger guy she comes across. When her character meets her demise, Kevin Costner's character would have been wise just to walk away from the whole ordeal. Right why risk your life for some gold digging woman?! Of course, the plant has a few twists and turns, so reasonable thinking doesn't come in to play here.

This was that kind of film. You felt the performances in your bones.The film had that type of chemistry between all the major players. The plot would just seem like it was going to lag and then you get twisted around again. Three years later I went out and bought the script with a month's worth of money from my first job. I still have that script on my bookshelf. I also have had a copy of this film in my collection for the last 10 years.Sean Young was still at her peak and the limousine scene is unforgettable. It is also proof that you can add sex in a movie without making the audience think they will be taking time away from the theme and plot of the movie. Will Patton of Remember the Titans was also starting his movie career and played his character of a ""protect the Director at any cost"" to a ""T"". Gene Hackman was Brice in this movie.George Dzundza as the loyal friend, Iman as the South African caught in the middle of her friend's indiscretion and Chris D. as one of the ""Contras"" helped round out the supporting cast.Roger Donaldson's direction really helped you feel the tense pace and the closed in feelings in the Pentagon.I gave this film a 9 because it may be seen as outdated due to some cold war references.",No Way Out

Each character is very unique and you can see it in the film- While the MC {Main character} is quite the generic-good-guy (Which is unique to the environment he's in, so it's not THAT generic), everyone else around him are special in their tone and behavior and even their looks. Now, the plot is also very good. Even amazingly good. Spoiler free- The MC is a commander in the navy who is recruited to the pentagon, and he dates the senators mistress. (No spoilers thus far.

I don't get these criticisms.

The story basically revolves around Costner's character trying to discover who killed his lover, before he is framed for it. Of course, he is trying to do this in a closed off Pentagon building while eyewitnesses are being brought in just to point out him. Of course, you have side stories going on everywhere.

The worst part is that the director treats the audience as if they are idiots. The ""twist"" ending makes zero sense. The motivations of the main character throughout the movie don't follow.

The result is fine if you have no memory, but if you should dare to think about what you've seen, you find one huge and unacceptable flaw: The character you see acted is not the one the movie wants you to take with you when you go.It isn't so much that the big surprise isn't fun, it's that there's too much good acting before this huge surprise happens to let you accept the humongous surprise as anything but an effort to con the audience into thinking they've seen a smart movie. Alas, it isn't a smart movie, it's a pretty good movie with a stupid device.I'm reminded of the efforts to save a movie by inserting a narrator.

There are no loose ends. Every dialog, every scene and every moment in this flick has been beautifully filmed.The story revolves around a Soviet Spy who makes it into the Pentagon. And there is a murder that connects Costner with the actual murderer. With a Soviet Spy running loose in the Pentagon,it is a race against time as to how Costner traps the murderer. The love scenes shot between Costner and Young in the car are really intense. The movie on the whole is worth watching. I saw this movie in the early 90's and its been the 3rd time that i watched it on TV and never was there a dull moment as i enjoyed it again.The best part of No Way Out is that the suspense is maintained till the last scene.

While driving the couple around the US Defence Minister's chauffeur thinks that this is very amusing! Sorry, but who really think that this is the way they live in Washington???? In another scene the Minister of Defence (Gene Hackman, who is the best actor) talks about top secret subjects while having his feet on the desk and holding his hand onto the telephone. Who is on the other end of the line? The Minister did not not finish his call, and he did not hung up. We don't know. Does he? Where do the witnesses, who still could recognize Farrell (Kevin Costner), suddenly disappear shortly before the climax takes off? They were a first-rate-danger for nearly 10 minutes of movie time, but then...? No explanation! Finally Farrell writes the name of one of the CIA agents on the computer print, where the golden box is listed, that obviously never had been a present from a foreign politician to Brice (Gene Hackman).

Because that seems like the most unprofessional thing to do ever. Mix in a flimsy espionage plot , stupid scenario's wherein people are keeping things that could destroy them in plain sight and what do you get ? No way out! No way out : A terribly over budgeted , poorly written snooze fest that as a bonus shows early versions of things we would later see done much better in the Jack Ryan films only without any of the existing international aspects of it , or any good character building moments , or James Earl Jones, or Alec Baldwin/ Harrison Ford , or anything remotely exciting really. No this is actually none of that when you watch it now that the once exciting technological aspects of it are both outdated and cliché. I have heard that this picture is a remake of a film made in 1948, If that is the case it would a lot more sense in my opinion. Although some then impressive tech is featured , It is basically a string of human errors on the part of the conspirators that exposes them. And the mistress being at the inaugural ball would have been less of a issue when there was less of a focus on affairs like these form the press , and less ways it could be recorded. But in 1987 the usage of limousines to pick up your mistress seems tenfolds more decadent than it would have done in 1948 . I suggest you watch that version , because this film's depiction of Washington intrigues was outdated even then. It also perfectly explains why Sean Young's character doesn't seem to have much of a professional career ahead and moves around the Washington social circuit without being involved in politics or government. This would make sense in the forties , it does not in the late eighties ( or at least it's painful to watch now ).Costner's Naval officer is a characterless Mary Stu in every single way h doesn't have much to play with , but when he does get to be angry or something his acting style often doesn't match the style of other actors in the scene. Gene Hackman in the same year he reprises his role as Lex Luthor in the now infamous superman IV once again plays a supposed genius ( they out right have people call him that actually ) but comes across more as a emotionally unstable autistic man at times, and frankly the character just turns into a big child towards the end. It's just pathetic to watch ; his character makes such weird mistakes and takes such ridiculous risks you can't take him seriously anymore.The chemistry between Costner and Young reminds me of twilight a lot. The script was apparently filled with looks that are supposed to convey 'a silent understanding' or something like that , but it never works!Hackman is seemingly over compensating for basically every poor delivery and stale look of all scenes he isn't in and he just turns into a caricature of a good actor near the end. Also the blatantly homosexual women fearing adviser having a clear crush on Hackman's character is incredibly sickening to watch as the character progresses. You know how in Django Unchained you are intrigued by the complicated relationship between Mr.Candy and Stephen ? well its nothing like that. It's just really sad.

Hackman, Costner, and Patton give great performances, with only Young lagging slightly -- the viewer is never entirely sure what attracted Brice to Susan in the first place. Perhaps the scene in the limo is an example of her four-sheets-to-the-wind personality. It certainly ensnared Costner.Much has been said about the last five minutes of the film. It's a great use of the ""Yuri"" red herring that runs throughout the film, though it doesn't necessarily add anything to the story, other than to reinforce the paranoia that no one really is who they seem, and no one can be trusted. An ideal twist is one that isn't needed to enjoy the film -- here, it's not needed but only muddies the water in terms of where sympathies lie.The one aspect of this film that truly doesn't stand up is the score.

98,atomicgirl-51733,"Childish, amateurish pseudo-thriller...and the VERY type of movie that the Red Scare was warning about",1,1 August 2021,"The local NY tri-state area PBS station has movie nights every Saturday and for the longest time, it aired classics. Now it plays warmed over junk. I had never see No Way Out when it was first released, but as soon as I saw the opening credit, I knew this was trash.Let me get to what's wrong with this movie from a strictly storytelling standpoints. It's a pseudo-thriller, in the vein of Marathon Man and Black Sunday. An actual thriller is supposed to be taut, suspenseful and plausible, and the twists and turns both sophisticated and clever. Pseudo-thrillers fake sophistication by making the story either convoluted or bogging the story down in what are known as ""red herrings."" There will be tons of chase scenes and dialogue with characters that really, when you get down to it, are there to throw you off track.This movie has stuff like this in spades. The story is so unsophisticated, so crude, that you could sum it up in one paragraph: a high ranking US official accidentally kills his mistress. Fixers cover up the mess by trying to frame a known Russian spy. The ""hero"" of the movie realizes what's happening and keeps running from the bad guys--a lot. There's no real investigation to be had here because...DING DING DING...turns out HE is the Russian spy that the fixers are trying to pin the murder on!All of this is played out in such a clunky, amateurish fashion that it's cringe-inducing from beginning to end. The editing is so terrible that I couldn't even follow what was going on more than half the time. The prelude to the murder is so obvious I practically started laughing. (Oh, there is a staircase. Oh, look, they're fighting near the staircase. Oh, gosh, wonder what's gonna happen? WHOOPS! Didn't see that coming!) Everything else that happens is bad, cheesy, obvious.The only remotely decent and legitimately inspiring moment in this movie is when Gene Hackman's character turns on the one person who's so loyal to him that he was willing to kill and risk his reputation to protect him. But that's about it.Now, let me get to this twist that everyone is raving about it. People praising it don't understand why it's there. This is not a twist meant to be clever. It's meant to be subversive. By that I mean, the movie sets you up to think that Kevin Costner is the All American Hero who has such a duty to his country that he will even undermine his ""superiors."" But the twist is that he wasn't one at all. He was a Russian spy.The fact that he was the Russian spy puts the entire movie in a new light. It's not about American patriotism. It's about the morally upstanding and so much smarter Russians exposing how thoroughly bankrupt the American political system is and Americans are. Americans are so corrupt that they will even sell out their own mothers, their best friends.This is literally the type of subversive stuff that had an alcoholic Senator McCarthy raving about in the 1950s. He may have been a fall down drunk and megalomaniac, but he is 100% right on the money about how there were elements in Hollywood that were trying to use movies to undermine American values. Incidentally, the fresh-faced, All American Boy Next Door Kevin Costner would be used for the exact same purpose in another subversive movie, JFK. I mention his look because subversive filmmakers like Stone and this particular one for No Way Out were smart enough to realize that Americans would be more willing to accept their subversive movies if they cast an actor with the perfect ""All American, apple pie. Wholesome"" look to him that would cause Americans to trust the film implicitly.",No Way Out
99,blantyrekelly,Good political thriller,7,16 March 2015,"Saw No Way Out the other night for the first time in over 20 years. It happened to be on TV and my wife, who has never seen it, and I decided to sit down and watch it after I told how good it was.For the first 15/20 minutes I wondered if I had been remembering the same film. Those first 15 minutes or so make you think that you are watching some straight to video 1980's cheap thriller. But once you get past that first wee while, it kicks in and you get swept along with it.There is the twist, and as others have suggested, it does seem a bit rushed. It's as if they didn't quite know how to end the film or ran out of time and/or money.Costner, Hackman and Young give good performances. The likes of George Dzundza and Fred Dalton Thompson give their usual solid support. Will Patton does tend to over do it slightly.Never the less, if you haven't seen it, and want a decent thriller to pass a couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than catch No Way Out.",No Way Out
100,Tampa_Tom,One of my favorites!,10,4 June 2003,"15 years later, this one is still an awesome movie.  First half of the movie develops at its own pace (Some call it slow), but shows the depth of passion growing between Costner and Young.(Spoiler Ahead)Once the murder happens, the movie kicks into high gear - a real gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The time pressure adds an outstanding level of tension you can cut with a knife - or a straight razor!The scene where Yuri is 'revealed' shows just how crazy people in power can become, and the surprise twist at the end had me wanting to hit the rewind button in the theater if one existed.This one is a must see!",No Way Out
101,clweber-weber,"It's philosophy, not Action or politics!",7,26 January 2013,"I think y'all are missing the point of this movie - especially those of you who think the ending should be dropped.In the end, the questions we are left with are those of ethics and morality: if I use false or fabricated information to arrive at a true answer, am I wrong? Should I be punished? Should I not pursue the conclusion? If I fight against a cover- up, but all of my other representations are false, should I be trusted or believed in my one instance of honesty? Should I be allowed to get away with my trespasses?This movie challenges the viewer to reflect on these issues, which would not exist without the current ending.Finally, this is Kevin Costner at perhaps his most perfect, luscious moment. Worth seeing once!",No Way Out
102,strangerdave,Find a way,2,5 January 2001,"Another potentially intriguing movie ruined by ridiculous car chases, unbelievable coincidences, and an insipid ending which gives the viewer a cheap thrill, but once examined makes no sense whatsoever when one recalls how the characters behaved throughout the film and the motivations for their actions.Don't buy it, don't rent it, and don't waste time watching it.",No Way Out
103,eamonwalsh-33522,"Amazing performances, writing and directing",10,25 May 2019,"The first great movie I watched. Gene Hackman is a great actor, but for this viewer, in this movie he is the fourth most impressive cast member. Amazing performance by Will Patton as the utterly loyal aide, Costner is nothing short of mesmerising, and Sean Young is excellent. Amazed that Costner and Patton, and the writers and director not considered for Oscars for this movie, but what do I know.",No Way Out
104,lethalreno,Political Thriller,6,4 August 2006,"I remember seeing this when I was twelve and home one day and thought it was brilliant. Gene Hackman can pull off any role and his portrayal as Defense Secretary David Brice really won me over! Kevin Costner was absolutely gorgeous when he was younger and isn't bad now. Sean Young looks crap these days but was really beautiful back when she was twenty-eight. Tom Farrell is a navy officer who gets posted at the pentagon and is to report to the secretary of defense David Brice. At a party one night he see's a very beautiful woman across the room. Her name is Susan Atwell and she is having an affair with the secretary. They go to her best friend's place Nina Beka, played by a thirty-two year old Iman. The scene in which they're in the limo together and are already getting their clothes off is actually quite raunchy. And Sean Young had a great body back then so she pulls it off well. During their affair he asks her numerous of times to leave the secretary but she wont. During fun and games she takes a Polaroid of him which he scrunches up and chucks under her bed. During a fight between the secretary and herself Susan is killed. The secretary devices a ploy to frame someone. The Polaroid image is found but seems to be ruined. The team in the Pentagon try to regenerate the photo. They can make out a man and they decide that he who is in the Polaroid is the killer. SO Tom has only a few hours to do something about it. Will he be framed for the murder of the woman he loves or will he escape and prove the secretary the KGB mole? Watch it and find out it's a great film! If you like Sean Young I recommend her in 1991's ""A Kiss Before Dying"" which I only saw only on television days after I saw ""No Way Out"" on television.",No Way Out
105,seanocalley-19787,A good movie ruined by absurd background research.,3,17 August 2020,"A low-grade spoiler is that the foreign spy was known to be inside the Pentagon. All the doors were locked and the heros conducted a room-by-room search...of the Pentagon, which happens to be the largest office building on Earth.
If this were a cop movie, Starsky and Hutch would pile into their red-and-white Ford Gran Torino and speed about L.A., chasing a tip that the Soviet spy was wearing a green knit cap. Surely we can find the Commie snitch! Obviously, nobody who pre-productioned the movie had ever been in the Pentagon.
In another howler of a gaffe, the grateful Soviet spy agency offered a spy a special reward - the opportunity to return to (his/her) beloved Russia. In the real world USSR of the time, any spy would have chosen employment as a prison janitor in Needles, California, over returning to the paranoid and dull world of the USSR. Look it up. Again, bad pre-pro work turns a decent movie into a giggle-fest.",No Way Out
106,Zekarius,Definitely underrated first-class thriller,9,21 March 2007,"There are only a fistful movies I gave 9 points. This is one them. After watching it I immediately had an itch to watch a sequel (regrettably impossible due to the story line). Didn't actually want it to stop and was sad that it ended. (True for just a few other movies, like for example Dr. Zhivago or 12 Monkeys) When I checked the IMDb - rating composition to find out why this movie is so grotesquely underrated, I asserted that the IMDb Staff gave 8 points, anyway. (Phew!) One of the very few US-thrillers, the end of which I wasn't able to predict. Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner are habitually brilliant, Will Patton deserves an Oscar as the best supporting actor in my book.",No Way Out
107,gerardgr,Skip the last five minutes,8,18 July 2005,"This movie is great, but why did they ever add the last five minutes. I was OK with the story of Farrell being used by men at the top. I didn't need any surprising switch, especially one that is not necessary to explain the story so far.The revelation at the end of for example ""The Sixth Sense"" is good. There you see something happening that helps you understand the movie you have just seen. It leaves you puzzled for a while, replaying the entire movie again in your head. Nothing like that happened at the end of ""No way out"".But then again, the movie's great.",No Way Out
108,brucefest,As suspenseful as 'Mystic Pizza!',1,3 June 2008,"""You have no idea what men of power can do!""A truly awful movie. Every twist and turn telegraphed: from the 'accidental push over the balcony railing' to the 'placing of the gun just within reach of the bad guy.' As an added extra bonus, the groan-inducing, stomach punch of the last scene, sinks this movie to transcendental awfulness.IT IS ALL HERE FOR YOU: Costner cardboard acting: CHECK Sean Young looniness: CHECK Handicapped genius killed in cold blood: CHECK Bad Guy who is latently in the closet going homicidal: CHECK Gene Hackman not-so-good-guy-turns-sympathetic-at-end: CHECKSee it at least once because everyone's movie-viewing system needs a good flushing once in awhile!",No Way Out
109,cougmumby,From the depth of fourth time around,9,11 October 2013,"I've just hauled this off the shelf and watched it for the umpteenth time. Flawed though it is, I love it. The controversy amid reviewers is surprising to me; but perhaps I don't watch sufficient ""thrillers"" to have a list of expectations--which several folks seem to have found unfulfilled. Spoilers: ""No Way Out"" is composed of one surprise after another...a series of surprises, if you will. From learning that Tom and Susan's original meeting was contrived by others to the shock of her murder, to the reappearance of the forgotten Polaroid negative, to the murder of the IT man and the final scene, with its suspense-filled last scene, I--as a repeat viewer--was constantly aware of Tom's reaction to every incident in the light of what the ending revealed to us....as well as what it did not. The last line, ""let him go. He'll be back. He has nowhere else to go"" is so poignant.This is very early Costner. The work of a business administration major who suddenly decided he wanted to act. The subtleties in what I understand was only his second performance are astonishing. If you didn't like it, forget it. but if you did, I strongly recommend watching it at least three times.",No Way Out
110,maggiesoup-863-26136,Enjoyable romp- just one thing though...,7,27 July 2020,"The music was truly awful- typical 80s electronic trash, which immediately dates the film. I love movie music but this surely could have been done so much better. Shame, really, because it wasn't too bad a movie!",No Way Out
111,eddiechan3,Great movie!,10,13 June 2003,"Excellent, thought-provoking, intricately crafted thriller, with plenty of plot twists and turns.

112,simonynwa-16181,Good,6,1 April 2016,"It takes quite a while to get going and the film is firmly rooted in the 80s, not just from a storyline perspective, but also in terms of its production. The only meaningful female role is poorly developed, although Young does her best with what she has and the relationship between her and Costner feels forced. The score is also dreadful. But once the main plot kicks in, this becomes an intriguing conspiracy thriller as Costner attempts to stay one step ahead of the investigation he is heading. Hackman is surprisingly low-key here, but Will Patton as his right-hand man and Costner's main antagonist is good value. It is also a film that is defined by its great ending, a scene that is surprisingly low-key in its delivery, but works extremely well in the context of the overall film. It's a shame that repeat viewings don't really offer much to reevaluate characters and plot points as a result but it still makes for a clever resolution.",No Way Out
