0,bkoganbing,Vengeful Spirit With A Life Of Its Own,5,6 August 2010,"The Grudge, a remake of a Japanese film of the same name, finds Sarah Michelle Gellar as an exchange student in the Land of Rising Sun who accepts a babysitting gig. Little does she realize that puts her in a whole heap of trouble.It seems as though there was a murder in that house of a woman and baby a few years earlier and the spirit is restless. Anytime anyone goes near the place and that includes the Japanese police something dreadful happens to them. The vengeful spirit kills indiscriminately and it has taken on a life of its own and is called, The Grudge. Gellar sure could have used the martial arts skills from Buffy The Vampire Slayer though I'm not sure how much they would have helped against the undead.The Japanese version apparently has gotten considerable acclaim, but for me this is just another slasher flick.",The Grudge
1,Leofwine_draca,Best of the Asian horror remakes,5,24 July 2016,"After the success of the American remake of THE RING, I guess it was inevitable that Hollywood would start producing more versions of Asian horrors. This is their second effort, a virtual scene-for-scene remake of the previous year's JU-on: THE GRUDGE, itself a remake of an earlier film simply titled JU-ON. Confused yet? You will be – as far as I make it, no less than six films have been built around this premise so far, with a seventh (and possibly eighth, knowing Hollywood) on the way. Really, if you've seen the original Japanese version, you have absolutely no reason to see this movie. It's inferior in every respect, and the decision to use sub-par CGI effects in some scenes makes them laughable rather than frightening – the appearance of the ghost hovering above the bed just looks atrocious.The good news is that Sam Raimi produces under his Ghost House banner, which means things are a little less insipid than they would be otherwise. This film is an old-fashioned horror effort that mixes the plots of JU-ON and JU-ON: THE GRUDGE to a sometimes confusing effect. I liked the fact that the focus was on the scares throughout – no padding or time-wasting here, just straight into the fear factor. The inclusion of scenes from JU-ON (which I hadn't seen) kept me on my toes, although everything else was pretty much reproduced from the original, shot-to-shot. This may be because the Japanese director came across, but even so I'd have liked a little more loosening of the apron strings, a little greater variety. Maybe that's just me.The cast isn't great. Japanese actors have a great way of portraying realistic subtlety, so when you see Sarah Michelle Gellar sweating and acting with wide-eyed fear, it doesn't really have the same impact. She's always just acting. The other cast members are pretty bland, and Clea DuVall is STILL awful, ever since I saw her in THE FACULTY. Bill Pullman was pretty good though, while the inclusion of Japanese actors from the original, playing the cursed family, is a nice touch. Being a Sam Raimi production, Ted Raimi inevitably shows up, here playing the head of a care agency, and it's great to see him in a larger supporting role than usual. One thing I did like a LOT was that the film becomes more serious, and more scary, as it progresses. Scenes such as the 'jaw' scare are spot on, while the full-blooded climax doesn't disappoint – it may be that the film actually becomes scarier than the original at this point! So, all in all, this isn't a great film, but it is a pretty good one – better still if you haven't caught the Japanese version.",The Grudge
2,SnoopyStyle,Really tame,4,5 August 2014,"When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage... A curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury.Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman) kills himself jumping off his apartment balcony in Japan.Yoko visits elderly Emma (Grace Zabriskie) living in a Tokyo house. She is attacked by a spirit. Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a student nurse living in Tokyo with her boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr). Karen takes over Yoko's job with Emma after she disappeared. Karen finds little boy Toshio trapped in a taped up closet.The movie flashes back to when Emma is first shown the house with her kids Susan (KaDee Strickland) and Matthew (William Mapother) and his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall).The only interesting thing in this movie is Japan. Sadly, it doesn't even take full advantage of that since most of this takes place inside the house. The spirits aren't that creepy and not scary at all. The kills aren't gruesome. It's just very tame. There really isn't anything to this movie. There is also a problem with all these tangentially connected characters. They have no emotional relationship with SMG's Karen. The disconnected nature really lowers the stakes of this movie. The spirit chasing KaDee Strickland in Japan is the most compelling sequence but again she has no real connection with Karen.",The Grudge
3,claudio_carvalho,A Different Haunted House Movie,6,16 July 2005,"In Tokyo, when the American student Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is called by a Japanese social support agency to replace her Japanese colleague Yoko (Yoko Maki) in the assistance of the American sick woman Emma (Grace Zabriskie), she realizes that something supernatural lives in the huge house. Inspector Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) investigates a series of deaths of visitors of the subjected house, and based on a Japanese belief, he convinces himself that the place is cursed.""The Grudge"" is a different movie of haunted house. I have not had the chance to see the original ""Ju-on: The Grudge"" yet, but this story is much related to Japanese culture. The beginning of the film makes reference to a Japanese saying about rage, which is unknown in Western cultures. The non-linear screenplay works reasonably, but could be better and better. It gives me the impression that something is missing to be a great movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Grito"" (""The Scream"")",The Grudge
4,kosmasp,"Same director, comes close",7,12 May 2007,"The same director is working on the remake, as did on the original Japanese movie. The main reason for the truthfulness of the original, are the producers on hand here. Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert as the main ones! They wanted to let the director decide what he was going to do, where he was going to go with the movie. And he went/stayed in Japan for the story/plot. Which is a brave move, because it could've easily flopped in the USA. People could be alienated and feel detached, because it's not their (western) world, they do know. People might also be confused by the time structure (jumping forward and backwards in time like in the original). If you can get over that, you will be scared! :o)",The Grudge
5,gavin6942,Bland Film... Not Sure Why So Much Money Was Earned,5,25 March 2007,"A social worker (Sarah Michelle Gellar) goes to work in a house that has a horrible power inside it. The ""grudge"" lingers there and tries to kill all who come into its path.I didn't want to see this film when it came out, and I only watched it now almost three years later because it seemed like an obligation. I think it was as bad as I expected, maybe even worse. The best actor in the film (Bill Pullman) was given such a weak part that he couldn't have saved it if he tried.The actor who impressed me most was Ryo Ishibashi, who played the police chief. He has been showing up in more American versions of Japanese films lately, and I can understand why. He ""gets it"" and can play to either audience with equal fervor.Sarah Michelle Gellar would seemingly be a great one for horror (all those years of Buffy, and a handful of other horror films) but she never really seems to get out of the ""teen movie"" groove and into a more terrifying frame of mind. Ted Raimi, on the other hand, is better here than ever before. His work in ""Skinner"" and ""The Damned Thing"" was disappointing. But he was better here than he's been since ""Intruder"". And Clea Duvall is always a nice touch. William Mapother (best known as Tom Cruise's cousin) showed up, but he has never been good, not even on ""Lost"".I wasn't scared by the ""comb noise"" (the thing that comes out of the ghosts' mouths), but I freely admit I put my head under my blanket during the security camera scene. Ever since ""The Ring"" (which this obviously rips off) I have been afraid of sinister little girls who meander towards a camera at a jagged pace. Well, that and the fact little girls in general are very scary (and more so when they grow up).I was unclear why some of the victims were attacked (especially the sister/daughter working in the office). Her connection to the house was pretty minor. But maybe I missed something, and I'm not going back to catch it again.If thee was any reason to watch this, it would be for Ted Raimi or to get it out of your system or for the beautiful music of Christopher Young. I don't think many people pay attention to the score of a film, bu they ought to. Young is the genius behind the ""Hellraiser"" music (a good soundtrack, you should buy it). And he hasn't lost his edge in the past two decades. No one does horror like Young. Unfortunately, even the best music does not make a film good... and this one just plain stinks.",The Grudge
6,jboothmillard,The Grudge,3,7 September 2005,"It is strange that the director of the Japanese original, Takashi Shimizu, would remake his own film into English (well, American), this obviously came two years after The Ring remake, but this has Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man) producing. Basically Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the American nurse who has moved to Tokyo, Japan, and is caring for the elderly and immobile Emma Williams (Grace Zabriskie) in her home. Of course this home has had some strange things going on over the years, and when Karen is caught up in this deadly curse, i.e. The Grudge, through flashbacks we see the other victims who suffered the consequences. Obviously we see Emma's family, her son Matthew (Lost's William Mapother) and his wife Jennifer (Zodiac's Clea DuVall), and then we see Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman) and his wife Maria (Rosa Blasi), all are eventually pulled into the horror where they are haunted or killed by the mysterious long haired girl or see the little Japanese boy. Karen is somehow taken back in time to see Peter's encounters with The Grudge, and in photos we see that the Japanese girl with the long hair has been stalking for some time, and obviously the film ends in the dark way. Also starring Jason Behr as Doug, KaDee Strickland as Susan Williams and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Alex. The story is rather complicated, and not even the smallest scary moments that do grab your attention, such as a shadow becoming a live figure in a corridor, and hands appearing in Gellar's hair, can save this film from having a dreary story, and not all making much sense, a pretty terrible horror thriller. Adequate!",The Grudge
7,Tweekums,Creepy; Gave me goosebumps,7,10 April 2008,"I haven't yet seen the Japanese original but as this version was the one on TV I decided to give it a go. I'm pleased that I did as it was better than I expected of a remake, I suspect it was helped by the fact that it was remade by the original director.While it isn't the best of stories it is certainly creepy, several scenes gave me goosebumps which is the main thing needed in a horror film.The basic plot is that there is a house in Tokyo that has been haunted since a mother and child where murdered by the man of the family and anybody who visits the house is doomed to die fairly soon afterwards. The ghosts are certainly creepy but unfortunately we didn't have enough time to get to care about the main character, a nurse played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, which made me less concerned about her plight.I was pleased to see that it didn't fall into modern horror cliché of adding excess gore and gratuitous nudity.",The Grudge
8,ma-cortes,A vengeful specter kills everybody go into a haunted house,6,13 August 2009,"In Japan when a nurse is assigned to visit a family she's chased by a vengeful and supernatural spirit that possesses its victims. Meanwile a man (Bill Pullman) commits suicide dropping himself from a high apartment. Karen Davis (Sara Michelle Gellar) a volunteer social agrees to cover another assistant. He goes to the ghastly house and find an elderly woman (Grace Zabrinski.) Then happen several flashbacks about the family (Clea Duvall, her husband and his sister KaDee Strickland). A series of terrible and mysterious deaths occur. A Police Inspector (Ryo Ishibashi) attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery. But Karen is also racing to saves her boyfriend (Jason Behr) and must now find to break the horrifying spell.This frightening movie displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama and creepy images. While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan. Nice cinematography by Yamamoto, Takashi Miike usual cameraman. Well produced in Japan by Robert G. Tapert and Sam Raimi and of course with intervention his brother Ted Raimi, as always. The motion picture is professionally directed by Takashi Shimzu in similar style to Hideo Nakata movies -The ring, Dark Water-. Shimzu is an expert on horror cinema with creepy phantoms of pale complexion and long hair . After that, he made ¨Reincarnation¨ also called ¨Rinne¨ again with palish phantoms and ¨Marebito¨ about a vampire in the Tokyo underground. It's followed by Grudge II again with Sara Michelle Gellar and Amber Tamblyn and similar equipment technical and artistic ; furthermore in production the third part. Rating : Acceptable and passable.",The Grudge
9,BA_Harrison,Here we go again...,4,13 February 2012,"This is director Takashi Shimizu's fourth attempt at telling the Ju-on legend, only this time he's targeting a Western audience, and is armed with a bigger budget (courtesy of Sam Raimi) and a US star in the appealing form of Sarah Michelle Gellar. It doesn't make a great deal of difference...Rather than take this opportunity to iron out the creases evident in his 2002 film (and boy, was that sucker creased!), Shimizu regurgitates almost precisely the same mess, albeit with more polished and slightly bloodier effects and a louder soundtrack to help deliver those all important jump scares.Being in English and designed for mass consumption by the multiplex crowd, a little effort has clearly been made to try and make the plot easier to comprehend, but in the end, it is still pretty confusing and not in the slightest bit scary (unless, as I mentioned in my earlier review for Ju-on, you have a irrational fear of small boys in body paint or crap yourself at either the sound of a phone ringing or someone with a very croaky throat).",The Grudge
10,moonspinner55,"Same old story, this time set in Tokyo...",2,18 March 2007,"A group of witless (or, perhaps, incredibly naïve) Americans, all linked by the same haunted house, are terrorized by evil Japanese spirits. Takashi Shimizu directed this remake of his ""Ju-on"", yet this thriller has a distinct case of ""Ring""-itis (with a dash of ""Poltergeist III""). Staccato clips of mutilated faces--and a much-publicized bit with Sarah Michelle Gellar taking a shower with a demonic hand in her hair--was enough to put the film over at the box-office, but it is a positively grueling experience, repetitive and pedestrian. Few genuine scares, a disappointing production design, and surprisingly bad performances manage to sink ""The Grudge"" like a stone, yet enough people cared about it to warrant a 2006 sequel. * from ****",The Grudge
11,Quinoa1984,"makes little sense (and not in an interesting way), and laughable ""scares""",2,7 November 2009,"Takashi Shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film Ju-On The Grudge. While I haven't seen that film, I would have to wager that there's more imagination and originality (or some rip-off originality, in other words skill with known tropes of the Japanese ghost movie) than in his own directed remake. Maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal, or I would guess accessibility, for an American audience. What starts off with some potential - the hint of something very screwed up going on with Bill Pullman's sudden movement - just goes into a total jumble. And as a horror movie? Gimme a break.Tension could have been built on the situation - a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted - but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel. Scares? How's about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something. A black cat? Yeah, why not just make the ghost-boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which, in effect, is only creepy if you want cats. Plot? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told (meaning, while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall, they aren't), or for that matter have us care about ANYONE in the cast.By the time the characters, or those that are there for exposition, get around to telling us what is going on or whatever, there's little point to care. The film-making is shoddy (i.e. the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way), and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked (Gellar especially is disappointing, but Pullman, who shows up later after his first scene, is sorely miscast). Even when Shimizu tries for some average old ""Boo"" scares, like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the Grudge ghost, it's still silly. Just watch when she's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots. Either you'll go with it, and if so more power to you, or you'll laugh hysterically at the results. Count me in the latter.I'm not totally sure where this project went wrong - was it Shimizu having to retool it for the studios, or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision? Or maybe Raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and/or dull than they would be with someone else. The Grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn't make sense or at the least give us some horror-fodder to chew on. It's cineplex trash of a sad order.",The Grudge
12,wes-connors,Sukiyaki,3,12 October 2009,"""Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') stars as an American nurse who has come to work in Tokyo. Following a series of horrifying and mysterious deaths, she encounters the vengeful supernatural spirit that possesses it's victims, claims their souls, then passes it's curse to another person in a spreading chain of horror. Now, she must find a way to break this supernatural spell or become the next victim of an ancient evil that never dies, but forever lives to kill,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Hopefully, some of the other comments will help you understand what this film is about, because I'll be damned if I know. The Tokyo setting and Japanese villains - especially little Yuya Ozeki (as Toshio Saeki) - are interesting, but underwritten. The storyline jumps around in time for the sake of simply jumping around in time. The ending is particularly inexplicable. ""The Grudge"" is an English language re-make of Japanese director Takashi Shimizu's original ""Ju-on"" (2002), which you can safely bet is better.*** The Grudge (10/22/04) Sam Raimi : Takashi Shimizu ~ Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, KaDee Strickland, Bill Pullman",The Grudge
13,michaelRokeefe,Unexplained raging horror.,6,9 November 2004,"This is a cultural twist on the too familiar haunted house story...but with an abundance of attitude. You will jump; you will think your heart has stopped; and your goosebumps will have goosebumps. Based on the Japanese powerhouse JU-ON:THE GRUDGE(1963), in a modest house in Tokyo resides hidden terror. It is possessed by a plague on the lives of those who enters it. ""The Grudge"" causes victims to die in a powerful rage and like a virus becomes a chain of horror as it moves from one victim to the next.An American exchange student(Sarah Michelle Gellar)studying social work in Japan agrees to care for an elderly woman(Grace Zabriskie)victimized by more than her catatonic being. The house should otherwise be deserted when the young woman begins to hear the sound of scratching and upon investigating she is starkly introduced to supernatural horror. The story might lose something in translation; but what makes this movie so creepy and heart pounding is the superior collaboration of lighting, sound and camera editing. The atmosphere is confusing and profound. The only way to prepare for this suspenseful horror roller coaster is Prozac and a change of underwear.Also in the cast are: Jason Behr, William Mapother, Clea DuVall and Bill Pullman. Kudos to director Takashi Shimizu.",The Grudge
14,Hey_Sweden,Above average American remake of a foreign film.,8,9 October 2012,"This is due in no small part to the fact that the director of the original Japanese film, ""Ju-On: The Gruge"", Takashi Shimizu, is also at the reins of this effective shocker, which succeeds at melding a constant melancholy atmosphere with the traditional jump scares of the genre. It holds no surprises for anybody who has seen ""Ju-On"", but is still a good example of storytelling, as it moves from various points in time, telling of the assorted doomed individuals who come into contact with a Japanese house that had tragedy in its past. In 2004, an American exchange student named Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) does some investigating of her own, determined to find the cause of the horrific visions she's experiencing. Shimizu brings a great sense of style to this film, and, working from a screenplay by Stephen Susco (adapting Shimizu's original screenplay), does a nice job of capturing the experience of foreigners living and working in Japan. Even in its ""unrated"", extended form it's never as gory or exploitative as some viewers may expect, preferring to go for mood and atmosphere at all times. The director is also highly adept at building the mystery, as he reveals plot details a bit at a time and follows his characters on their doom laden paths. Moreover, we can like these characters and maintain genuine interest in seeing what happens to them. Special effects are generally well done, and one extremely effective touch is in seeing a supernatural occurrence actually show up on a surveillance tape. The integrated cast does very well under Shimizu's direction. The actors who played the ill fated family in his Japanese film - Yuya Ozeki, Takako Fuji, and Takashi Matsuyama - reprise their roles here, and Ryo Ishibashi of ""Audition"" fame plays the investigating detective. American cast members include Jason Behr, William Mapother, Clea DuVall, KaDee Strickland, Grace Zabriskie, Bill Pullman, Rosa Blasi, and Ted Raimi, whose brother Sam's company Ghost House produced the film. This has to rank as one of their finer efforts, a remake that is entirely respectful of its source and is just as legitimately creepy. Highly recommended. Eight out of 10.",The Grudge
15,Doylenf,Japanese flavored horror has a timeline problem...,6,18 January 2009,"THE GRUDGE never quite gets over its disorganized script problems.There's a glaring timeline factor that keeps the picture on the edge of a horror puzzle in which all the pieces don't really come together in a sensible enough way. Still, there are gripping scenes where you know something is about to happen, since there's an air of dread that hangs like a funeral wreath over the whole story.SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR has to handle most of the acting chores, succeeding in looking horrified and frightened the moment she enters the forbidden house where menacing spirits seem to be hiding in every shadow. BILL PULLMAN has an interesting opening moment but then disappears through most of the tale after his quick opening scene. We don't get to see him again until the film is almost over because the whole timeline of the story is so scrambled.Based on a Japanese horror film, it does a neat job of keeping the suspenseful elements as a hook that grabs the viewer, but some in the audience may become a bit impatient with the pace of the film which seems to have a sleepwalking slowness about it.Interesting, creepy, sometimes gory, but only a middling success. Well photographed and technically quite efficient.",The Grudge
16,LeonLouisRicci,Certainly Unremarkable,5,4 August 2013,"This Movie was a Mega-Hit. Going for it was a ticket friendly PG-13 Rating and that forever Adolescent wanting to be scared at the Movies. It seems that all you need is an eerie visual or two that is slightly unsettling and creepy, an unworldly sound effect or two, jumble the Films chronology (for that most Modern of Style) and Millions of Bucks can be yours.This is an overrated Movie that has spawned sequels and imitators. It is in fact and imitator itself. it is not only an imitator it is a remake, by the same Director. it has just been Americanized. But all that is not the problem. This is just not very cleverly conceived. It is a variety of setups to announce scares and a string of similar looking shots not so strategically placed, to build tension.In the end, it is of course, open ended, almost a prerequisite for Horror Movies, and is so Story shallow and anemic that it is quite disconcerting that a few jumps and a creepy makeup style is what makes a successful franchise.

17,poolandrews,Decent remake of a Japanese ghost story.,6,8 April 2008,"The Grudge is set in Tokyo in Japan where American foreign exchange student Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) works as a volunteer carer, her boss Alex (Ted Raimi) gives her a job to look after an old woman in a house after her usual carer Yoko (Yoko Maki) disappears. Once there Karen finds a mysterious young Japanese boy taped into a cupboard. Later on Alex visits the house & finds the old woman dead & Karen in a state of shock & fear, the police are called & they discover the bodies of the previous American owners in the attic as the house seems to throw up more & more sinister findings. Then Yoko turns up minus her jaw. Karen decides to investigates the past of the house & makes some shocking discoveries...This Japanese, American & German co-production was directed by Takashi Shimizu & is one of a recent spate of classic Asian horror films being remade by Hollywood like the impressive The Ring (2002), the awful Dark Water (2005) & The Eye (2008), I would say that The Grudge comes somewhere between the two as while it's not as good as the remake of The Ring it's nowhere near as bad as Dark Water. Annoyingly like a lot of recent horror films The Grudge is available in both a 'PG-13' theatrical cut & an 'Unrated' version (just to weed more money out of the fans as usual) which changes & adds a lot of things, I will be basing my comments on the standard theatrical cut. The script by Stephen Susco was based on the film Ju-On: The Grudge (2003) which was actually written & directed by Shimizu, it must have been weird for him remaking his own film within a year from a script written by someone else based on his original. Anyway, this remake sticks pretty closely to the original in many ways keeping most if not all of the main character's (although it changes the nationality of some to American), most of the significant events from the Japanese original take place & to be honest there's not a lot of difference between them. The film can be quite confusing at times as it has quite a loose narrative structure, it introduces people & then quickly dumps them, it goes between different sets of character's very suddenly which is quite jarring at times but it does all come together pretty well at the end. The actual ending revelation is a little routine, I was maybe expecting something a bit more dramatic but it works & that's the main thing.Director Shimizu does a great job, The Grudge is one of the few big Hollywood remakes which you can say has a really creepy & eerie atmosphere. There are some terrific jump moments, sure they are older than dirt with the likes of cats suddenly jumping into frame or a telephone ringing at a tense moment but they sure do work & are fun. There is also some pretty creepy imagery of ghost's, I could certainly see anyone who gets scared easily having nightmares after seeing The Grudge. The version I saw didn't have any gore apart from a ripped-off jaw & the owner of said jaw turning up. It's very well made with some nice long sustained scenes of horror, The Grudge is a film which goes for scares & atmosphere rather than CGI which is nice. The sound effect that accompanies the ghost is also quite unsettling & creepy in a odd sort of way.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 The Gudge wasn't a mega-budget film & it's near forty million dollar opening weekend actually surprised studio executives who quickly agreed to make a sequel. Actually shot in Japan. The acting is fine, Sarah Michelle Gellar is nice on the eyes, the Saeki family are all played by the same actors who played the roles in the Japanese original.The Grudge is a good solid pretty creepy horror film remake, I liked it although I doubt I would want to watch it again anytime soon. Followed by The Grudge 2 (2006) & The Grudge 3 (2009).",The Grudge
18,dbborroughs,"If you've seen the Japanese originals, you've already seen this film.",6,31 October 2004,"This review is really a word of warning, if you've seen any of the earlier Japanese versions of this story you've seen this movie before. If you've seen all four of the earlier films, you've really seen everything (except the frightening opening with Bill Pullman) and you'd best wait for home video.I understand that the film makers wanted to make sure that this film worked and made them money, so they repeated what worked, even casting the same Japanese actors for the kid and other roles; but it would have been nice if they had done more that was new beyond the opening sequence.This isn't to say that the film is bad, its not, rather, its just that unless you're walking in to the film fresh odds are you're going to be like me and know what each five or ten minutes is going to bring because of the set up of the sequence.For me it was a 6 out of 10, for fresh eyes probably higher.",The Grudge
19,zardoz-13,"Don't Budge for This ""Grudge!""",4,20 March 2009,"Scary Japanese horror movies were making a killing at the box office after Universal Pictures released ""The Ring,"" their terrifying 2002 remake of the 1998 Nipponese chiller ""Ringu."" Surprisingly, ""The Ring"" scared up so much money for Universal that the studio green-lighted a sequel. Not surprisingly, Columbia Pictures hopped onto the bandwagon, too, with their remake of ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" (2002), another legendary Asian supernatural saga in the ""Ringu"" tradition. As the second major Americanized rehash of a Japanese nail-biter, ""The Grudge"" toppled ""Shark Tale"" from the top box office slot with a shocking $40-million weekend haul.Despite its profitable numbers, ""The Grudge"" evokes few of the thrills and chills that made ""The Ring"" so riveting. As far as ""The Grudge"" goes, you might say that the spirit of this handsomely produced haunted house hokum must have been lost somewhere in translation. While ""The Grudge"" developed several spooky shutters, the hopelessly incoherent screenplay and the dire shortage of white-knuckled hysterics seriously undercuts its impact. Gorehounds will snooze, and only audiences that have never seen a horror movie may shriek. Although he didn't pen the lukewarm, R-rated, U.S. adaptation, Takashi Shimizu convinced Columbia to let him remake his own fright-mare with American leads on location in the land of the Rising Sun. Nevertheless, not even the same Japanese writer & director who called the shots on the three original ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" movies can conjure up more than just goose bumps with this atmospheric but anemic American version. Altogether, the result prove far less alarming because ""The Grudge"" delivers a less than satisfactory ending and the computer-generated, special effects look ridiculous.Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" plays a dull American exchange student in Tokyo. Our heroine fills in fro a social worker at a health-care agency when the latter disappears without explanation. As Karen Davis, Gellar finds herself assigned to care for an elderly catatonic patient, Emma (Grace Zabriskie of ""Gone in Sixty Seconds""), who has been abandoned apparently by the Japanese caregiver entrusted with her welfare. Initially, Karen freaks out when she enters Emma's house and finds it trashed. Along the way, Karen hears ominous noises, too. Meanwhile, Emma's son Matthew (William Mapother of ""Suspect Zero"") and her daughter-in-law Jennifer (Clea DuVall of ""Identity"") vanish mysteriously not long after they rent the house for her. Eventually, not only does a swirling, airborne poltergeists with a cadaverous face materialize out of thin air while Karen is tending to Emma, but also Karen notices a tight-lipped little Japanese boy prowling the premises with a black cat.Eventually, Karen learns that a murderous Tokyo dad killed his wife Kayako (Takako Fuji) and son Toshio (Yuya Ozeki), and then committed suicide. The domicile where this diabolical crime occurred somehow committed to memory the fury and the malevolence of the murder so that the undead spirits of Kayako and Toshio haunt it. Now, they hold a deadly ""grudge"" against anybody who ventures into those quarters! Later, Japanese authorities discover the missing corpses of Emma's son and his wife drained of all their blood and hidden in the attic. When Karen launches her own investigation into these evil spirits, she encounters another expatriate American, Dr. Bill Kirk (Bill Pullman of ""Independence Day""), who has been conducted his own probe. The only problem is that the Pullman character committed suicide at the outset of this epic, long before the Gellar character confronted the eerie happenings in this creepy but cobweb-free haunted house.Freshman scribe Stephen Susco's murky screenplay shuns the standard narrative flow of start to finish. Instead, this yawner unfolds as a series of flashbacks as it weaves itself chaotically around an array of characters, some dead and other alive, who cross paths but cannot communicate with each other. Shimizu doesn't let the normally charismatic Gellar strut her stuff, so she comes off looking and acting flat by comparison with some of her other film roles. Mind you, Shimizu knows how to set up scary scenes, but the pay-offs to his subtle but spooky shenanigans are less than harrowing. Half of the audience that I sat with Sunday afternoon where I saw this pathetic paranormal potboiler stomped out of the theater griping about how much ""The Grudge"" sucked.An ambiguous finale, passive performances, sketchy characters and a confusing storyline undermine whatever terror that the American account of this celebrated Japanese movie struggled to deliver. Don't budge for ""The Grudge!""",The Grudge
20,Boba_Fett1138,"Story and 'scare' overdose kill this professionally made, good looking horror movie.",6,23 July 2005,"This movie is very good looking. The 'ghosts' are extremely creepy looking and the sound effects are horrifying. Everything a good horror movie needs you might say. Well, not exactly, unfortunately the movie also suffers from some bad storytelling and a 'scare' overdose that take away a lot of the movie its tension and scary moments. It makes ""The Grudge"" a good looking but lacking horror movie, that perhaps still has more goods as bads but still remains a bit of a disappointing movie with lots of missed opportunities.Problem is that they basically tried to put a scary moment in literally almost every scene. I don't know why but after a while some of the scene's loose their power to scare you. Maybe its because you get used to the atmosphere and the scare moments of the movie, or something like that. Instead of making the movie scary it made the movie predictable and too much of the same the whole time.The movie its story is told in a completely illogically way. the time-line is very messy, it jumps from the present to what happened a few hours or days or years before to some totally different characters. It's not that it becomes difficult to follow but it's just that it feels pointless and unneeded that the story is told in that particular way. It also distracts from the main story line and the main character played by the boring and untalented acting Sarah Michelle Gellar. As a matter of fact, the story is told in such a way that the main character is perhaps only on screen for 50% of its running time, at the most.Big plus of me was Ted Raimi in a typical Ted Raimi role. His more famous brother Sam was one of the producers of the movie. Too bad Sam Raimi didn't directed this, I'm sure he would had made something more of this movie.It's all too bad, cause ""The Grudge"" is a well made movie that had lots of potential to become just as good as the other Japenese horror movie remake ""The Ring"". The movie however heavily suffers from the makers ambition to make this the ultimate scary movie. You might say that this movie died of a scare overdose.Still of course the movie still remain perfectly watchable thanks to the visual look of it and some nice sequences.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Grudge
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I'm not sure...,7,6 February 2005,"Coming back from the cinema after seeing this film, I'm not quite sure what to make of it. I guess it was on the way back, through the dark, empty streets, that I realized something was missing. Something important, maybe even crucial, something that needs to be there after just seeing a horror film on the silver screen. I wasn't scared. I wasn't looking over my shoulder, I wasn't listening for any strange sounds, I wasn't even looking twice on any person I walked past on the way. I'm a sucker for scary movies, I'll tell you that right away; but this didn't scare me. It startled me, made me jump in my seat, but that's it. That's what the 'horror' portion of the film is, a long series of jumps. There's nothing wrong with that... but that's just all it is. No real gore, no atmosphere, no psychological terror... just jumps. I'm not saying that any of the aforementioned qualities would make a better horror movie... but they probably would make it more 'full'. The truth is, sadly, there's nothing in this movie that will really stay in your mind for very long after you leave the cinema... if there's still anything after the end credits. Luckily, the director rarely resorts to the cheap jump scares... few of the shocks come from a cat jumping down from a shelf or a friend appearing behind the main character, reaching out and grabbing their shoulder. Most of the time, when you jump, it's because someone just died or something genuinely disturbing just happened. The worst thing about the jump scares is probably that you can only watch and still... well... jump, because after that, you'll know where and when the jumps will occur. What makes this watchable apart from the undeniable effect of the jump scares is that, on some level, it manages to appear deeper than it is, without being condescending. There are plenty of little details, stuff that only the most watchful eye will notice. The way the story is told is masterful in a way... very little dialog is used to explain it. A series of situations and powerful acting tell us far more than Hollywood-like dialog(which the film has slim to none of) could. The plot isn't deep, and it isn't really the driving force in the film, but there's enough of it and it's mostly good. The acting ranges, but most of it's pretty good. The characters are well-written and interesting, but most of them just aren't developed enough for us to care about whether they live or die, which is a fatal mistake on the directors part, because it kills a lot of the suspense. The non-linear time-line is presented so casually that many viewers will probably be thrown off(I know I was), and not know when exactly something is happening. One final note before I pass verdict; personally I thought it was a mistake to cast Joxer of Xena: Warrior Princess(Ted Raimi) in a serious horror film, but at least his role isn't very big. Also, he *is* the executive producer's brother, and, well, that's pretty much Hollywood in a nutshell. All in all, the film is pretty much worth watching, but probably only once, and with reasonable expectations. I recommend it to fans of the Japanese horror films, keeping in mind that this is an Americanized version(but done by the same director). However, even though I haven't seen them myself, you should probably see the original Ju-on film(s). Also, personally I don't think this is as good an American remake of a Japanese horror film as The Ring. Go see that first, as well. 7/10",The Grudge
22,neil-476,Flash bang wallop nothing,6,7 April 2008,"Once upon a time a Japanese man was very angry because he read his wife's journal and found that she'd fallen in love with someone else. So he murdered her and his 6 year old son and then committed suicide. Then, for no apparent reason, or else some hokey old legend made up solely for the purposes of this movie, the child and mother became angry ghosts (or ""spirits"" if you prefer, but I'm going with ghosts). Maybe the dad did too - I don't think so, but I'm not too clear on it, and the sequence of events sometimes gets a bit confusing in this movie.Were these ghosts interested in being helped to pass over to a more peaceful realm. Not bloody likely! They were far more concerned with generating mayhem to be visited on anyone who ventured into the house where they had been killed, including inducing people to jump off balconies, sucking the life out of people, and ripping the jaws off innocent home helps. What's more, this mayhem didn't just remain within the house - it followed the visitors around, and even travelled down phone lines (or something) to suck their relatives into mattresses (I can't believe I just said that).In fact, these ghosts were so malevolent and powerful that they even saw off Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They didn't kill her, although the final shock shot left you thinking......that they all died unhappily ever after.Definitely creepy, and a lot of shock moments, but few surprises and little sense.",The Grudge
23,AlsExGal,Doesn't translate well to an American audience,6,5 February 2010,"The main theme of this movie is that a powerful negative force inhabits a place after someone has died a violent death, and that this negative force consumes all who touch the place in which the violent act occurred. This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are ""ghosts"" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the ""wronged parties"" or ""ghosts"" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really ""get"" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless.On the positive side, the technical elements of the film were excellent, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary were indeed scary, and the roles were well acted. In fact, for you Buffy fans out there, did you notice that Sarah Michele Gellar was reunited with two BTVS alumni? Jason Behr, who played her love interest, was Billy Ford in ""Lie to Me"" in season two, and the American wife who was caring for her mother-in-law before she was murdered by the ""ghosts"" was played by the same actress who played Marcie Ross in ""Out of Mind Out of Sight"" from season one.",The Grudge

It is shocking to hear an audience cheer during such crap. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a caregiver who discovers that the mansion she is visiting is haunted. There is an elderly lady who sleeps and then shrieks at ghosts, and Gellar is not long identifying her problem. Starts out well with a suicide but becomes routine after the umpteenth person is killed. The ending is a complete cheat but what really stands out is the film's inability to make any sense. Why not create an interesting thriller about trauma? Instead director Takashi Shimizu Americanizes his Japanese film for no other reason than to allow Hollywood to rape his craft. Gellar holds her own as the caregiver overwhelmed by haunting images and decides to investigate the history behind it all. Other roles are not so lucky and fall into that camera stalk and kill cliché. Jason Behr, Bill Pullman and Clea Du Vall are completely wasted in roles that are subdued by visuals. The special effects are done with appeal but unfortunately the screenplay was not given the same regard. The only grudge held should come from Japan. Score: 2 ½ / 10",The Grudge

One of the biggest issues, though, is the fact that as a remake it really doesn't do anything to help the story told from the original so that can hold this one down somewhat. By keeping the familiar story and the jump scenes along the way, this can make for a trying time here by being too similar for its own good and not really having a whole lot really changed in terms of fixing the storyline or the different plot points within this. Still, this familiarity does manage to bring about many positives including a far better pace than the original. There's far more life to the non-attack scenes and the burgeoning mystery about the ghosts within the house keep this one moving so it doesn't feel as though it takes a long time to get going or even between scenes. When the attacks really start coming in earnest throughout here, this becomes all the more enjoyable by building off such a solid foundation with those intriguing non-attacks keeping the film going. Likewise, those attack are quite enjoyable on their own merits as incredibly entertaining and chilling encounters, most notably the numerous encounters inside the house from the first encounter with the ghost inside the bedroom, the encounter in the bathtub as well as the flashback to the previous owner and the utterly fun finale that has a lot going for it by mixing action with the chills so well. That the other attacks outside the house are rather well done is another plus, from the office building ambush to the hotel encounter and to the spectacular encounter at the office with the deformed ghost makes for a rather solid series of encounters here to make this quite fun. The only place this stumbles is the final half-hour by detailing an affair that really drags this to a halt instead of charging through into a furious finale, not to mention really lowering the impact of the curse by putting too much background into it. That does manage to lower this one somewhat, but it's still got enough here to really make a big impact.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",The Grudge

Now, Karen finds herself being tormented by that curse, as it eventually starts claiming it's victims.....In the early noughties, the cinema was rife with remakes of 'J-Horror', and even though some of them were good, it was just an excuse for Hollywood to make money, because some people just couldn't be bothered with subtitles.The Ring, Dark Water, Shutter, and this are prime examples.But at least this was directed by the originals director, so at least some respect has been maintained. Geller is in it, she's okay, but the movie goes to show that she could never carry a film. She more or less put a stake in her movie career with her performance, like rice with no salt, its does the job, but it's very bland.So thank heavens then for the rest of the cast, and the brilliant camera-work used when we see the ghosts.The lift scene, and the photo montage are standouts, in what other wise are jump scenes.Its one of those movies that the more you watch it, the less the horror will scare you, and the story will intrigue you more.Worth seeing, but if you've seen the original, don't bother.",The Grudge

Still though the story just was not up to ""The Ring's"" story. In this movie there really is no motivation for the killings to occur they say things about rage and despair, but the only one who would have felt that really was not part of the supernatural side of the movie. Still though it was entertaining enough and I love the fact it was set in Japan. It also makes me want to see the Japanese version as I know it will be better as this one was probably Americanized quite a lot. I preferred ""Ringu"" to ""Ring"" also. All in all though I enjoyed it, though I wished they would just release the Japanese versions here. Also, there is one part of the movie where one woman is having a hard time finding here way around Japan and I found this a little hard to believe.

29,The_Void,A surprisingly good remake for a change!,7,23 February 2005,"I've been less than impressed with the recent crop of Japanese horror films. Perhaps it's just because I don't like ghost stories much, but I think that for a bunch of films that are so highly acclaimed; they fall massively short of the mark, especially since they're so similar to one another. Another thing I've been less than impressed with is the way that America have been snapping up everything from Asia that they can get their hands on and remaking it. The Ring was remade with disastrous results, but nevertheless we find ourselves here with the latest remake; The Grudge. I haven't seen the original version of this film (and am in no rush to), but to my surprise this film is actually quite good. The Grudge stars Sarah Michele Geller (from that Buffy rubbish) and it follows her as she goes to work for a woman in Japan who needs caring for. The Grudge professes that whenever someone is killed in a fit of rage, a curse is broken and the spirit lay dormant for someone to enter that curse. Something that Buffy has just done...The Eastern setting helps to add mystery to the already mysterious plot. It is customary for American remakes to be moved to America, but the fact that this one didn't get relocated is much to it's credit. The film's effects are really good, and some parts where the ghosts are shown are genuinely quite creepy, due to the effects. However, the film goes a bit overboard with it's scares at times, and it goes for the money shot too often. For example; tension is mounting and then suddenly! ...the phone rings. It's such a waste, and although it does help to build the unease; the film would have been much better served if it kept the tension building, rather than diffusing it every five seconds with another nonchalant happening. The music in the film is very good, however, and it always serves in adding to the bewilderment that the film is keen to capitalise on. The Grudge relies a lot on it's sense of dread, and the music helps to capture that.The film isn't a complete whole, mostly for the reasons mentioned. However; as remakes of Japanese films go, this is a very good example and I recommend this one over most other films in it's class.",The Grudge

(I know that's off topic) The director knows how to create tension. This film is one long slow burn. Anticipation of the event maybe worse than the event itself. The grudge lives for fear, and fear it creates. The Japanese director adds a new feel for the film. A ghoulish and mysterious feel. Fresh film, and strong story line that unravels in the right order.

35,OllieSuave-007,The most scariest ghost/horror movie I have seen.,8,8 November 2013,"""The Grudge"" is quite possibly the most scariest ghost/horror movie I have ever seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar takes on the main role as nurse Karen living and working in Tokyo. While working she is exposed to a supernatural curse involving a vengeful spirit which locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming his/her life and spreading its curse to another person.This movie starts out with Karen moving to Tokyo with boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr), where we get a taste of drama as they adjust to their new lives in Japan. The suspense builds when they encounter mysterious events in the house Karen is a caretaker in and, what follows, are one creepy moment one after the other as main ghosts Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Toshiro (Yuya Ozeki) take center stage, wreaking havoc with those unfortunate enough to cross its path.Takashi Shimizu did a great job directing the movie that grabs the audience attention with scenes that send chills down your spine, has moments that make you jump, and has disturbing images that will stick in your mind after the movie is over. The mysterious yet dramatic atmosphere of the movie created an eerie feeling of the ongoing horror and the built-up suspense, which are contributed by the cast members' realistic and dramatic acting. Some of the plot lines dangled and are unexplained, but that is a minor flaw.Overall, this is a movie with the right balance of horror and drama - no over-the-top stuff.

I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything. It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is ""don't bother with something new when something old will do."" For although ""The Grudge"" is a remake of a recent Japanese film (""Ju-On,"" made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time. When she is sent to the home of a strangely ""lethargic"" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence. From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, ""The Grudge"" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film ""Carnival of Souls."" The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon. I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one.

37,bensonmum2,Some very creepy moments,7,13 February 2005,"The film's title refers to a Japanese myth involving the spirits of people who have died in ""the grip of a powerful rage"". Anyone who comes into contact with these spirits will die. The plot of The Grudge is very simple. An American exchange student, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), living in Japan takes a job with a health care center. When one of the other workers doesn't show up, Karen is given her first solo assignment helping an older lady in her home. When Karen arrives, she immediately realizes that something is not quite right. What she doesn't realize is that this house is possessed by spirits who will kill anyone who sets foot inside.Let me start by saying that I have not (as of 2/11/05) seen the original Japanese version. I plan to do so, hopefully, very soon. With that being said, I enjoyed The Grudge much more than I had expected. This is my first experience with Shimizu as a director, but I came away impressed. His has a nice ability to tell a story regardless of the language. The Grudge is one of the best examples of a non-linear story presentation that I can think of. As the movie progressed, it was a treat to watch Shimizu bring the pieces of the story together.Another plus for The Grudge was Shimizu's decision (probably based on budgetary concerns as much as anything) to primarily use ""real"" effects and less CGI. The make-up on the Kayoka character, for example, created a far more unsettling image than the use of CGI could have. It was obvious that Kayoka was a real person, not just a computer image. The overuse or inappropriate use of CGI has ruined many modern horror movies.There were, however, some areas where the movie could have been better. Gellar is one of the most unappealing leads in Hollywood. I've never understood what all the fuss is about. I always found her extremely annoying.While the movie has many truly creepy (some were downright scary) scenes, the movie relies far too heavily on ""jump moments"". You know what I mean - a character opens a door and a cat jumps out (The Grudge actually features a cat jumping out of a closet). I've always thought that jump moments were a cheap way to illicit a response from the audience. A few jump moments can be good, but too many just becomes tiring.Given that I wasn't expecting much, The Grudge was a lot of fun. I am looking forward to the sequel and to going back and discovering the original Japanese film - Ju-on: The Grudge.",The Grudge
38,sol-kay,Death House,6,5 January 2005,"***SPOILERS*** A house of horrors movie that goes beyond it's four walls to end up killing something like a dozen people by the time the movie is over. Set in Tokyo Japan "" The Grudge"" can't seem to get going as the story wonders for almost an hour until we get some insight to whats happening in the film and why. Even before the opening credits we see Peter Kirk(Bill Pullman), an American working in Japan, calmly wake up and step out on his high-rise apartment balcony and then jump to his death to the surprise and shock of his terrified wife Maria, Rosa Blasi. We have no idea what Peter in killing himself has to do with the story were seeing until almost the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. It's then that we realize he's the cause of the double murder and suicide that cursed and haunted the house that the movie's about. About three years ago a man went berserk and killed his wife son and even his pet cat then killed himself after he found out that his wife was having an affair with another man. Since then everyone involved with the house that these killings were committed ended up either dead or missing by being effected by the rage thats still within the four walls of the house. Even though were told in the movie's prologue that this rage would effect everyone that comes in contact with it with the same rage that the man who murdered his family and killed himself had. Only one person Matthew Williams, William Mapother, was involved in a murder. Killing himself after he murdered his wife Jennifer, Clea DuVall. The other deaths, because of the person being in the house, were caused by either the ghost of the wife and son of those originally being murdered and by another possible murder victim Yoko, Yoko Maki, a nurse in the killing of her boss Alex, Ted Raimi. None of the murders of the people who were effected by the rage were caused by, as far as I could tell, the ghost of the actual killer, the father. Even the pet black cat had something to do with the later killings. Unlike in almost all""House of Horrors"" films the terror in ""The Grudge"" continues after those involved long left the house. It seems to follow them where ever they go, like Jennifer's sister Susan, KaDee Strickland, and the star of the movie Karen, Sarah Michelle Gellar. The movie has a number of jolting scenes in it, mostly very predictable. One that really shook me up while watching it involved Karen and her boyfriend Doug, Jason Behr, while they were riding on a Tokyo bus.Even though the father of the household who caused all this rage to engulf the house is not involved in any of the killings we do see him in a black and white flashback brutally murdering his entire family.",The Grudge

Instead she encounters the evil that consumes the house and that if anyone who decides to enter their domain will feel their pain. So now she is racing the clock to figure out the past of the house and in doing so hopefully rid the curse she is now apart of.What I got was basically a rehash of what happen in the original, though there were some subtle changes in the story by Shimizu- but it basically stuck to the main idea, with the time-line of the story going back and forth with different characters that are caught up in the curse, while the home-care worker was the centre piece in the story. Like the original the story at times was uneven- but the atmosphere and images were persistent and simply stood out. To me the story was far less thought provoking, as the remake had less ambiguity, by tying up most of the loose ends and a detail background of the ghosts is explained- but because of that it lacks any kind of mystique that the original had. While the original needs multiple viewings to truly grasp the story, the remake isn't the case.Just like the original also you could say the director over-killed the use of the ghosts, though I would say the scenes in the original were more creative and memorable the scenes of the ghouls were spooky at first with small and subtle glimpses- but after a while it just became repetitious. Though there is some nicely built up tension and fast paced thrills in certain scenes by Shimizu. The music score was too transparent to make it alarming and less effective to be freaky- but the eerie sound effects were definitely perfect in setting the mood.The acting takes a back seat, not awful-but nothing that good. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen is alright- but really there is nothing fascinating about her presence, Bill Pullman is wasted in a small cameo role, Jason Behr as Karen's boyfriend seems fairly uninterested and deadpan, while Ted Rami lacks any sort of detail as Karen's boss. Some of the original cast of Ju:on make appearances- but overall there is no real character development, as they come and go with little to do.The settings are quite good, with a very gloomy Tokyo, the haunted house itself is truly menacing and hollow you can just feel the coldness and evil lurking. The violence is nothing graphic, while the chills and scares are either pretty subtle (e.g. striking images or sounds) or the usual BOO! With something popping out though that type of scare was pretty predictable .The ending for me was a bit of a cop out, with the usual let's leave the door open for a possible sequel- but overall I didn't mind this slickly done remake... though I didn't find it as creepy as I did the original.The reason for the constant comparisons with the original in the review is that I watched it the night before seeing this. Anyway it's worth checking out.3/5",The Grudge
40,Robert_duder,"Creepy, decent, but mostly forgettable",8,27 October 2004,"I suppose with this film being a remake of a Japanese horror film by Takashi Shimizu, who also did this remake, there will be the inevitable comparisons to ""The Ring."" Say what you will but The Ring was horrifying, and although the original Ju-On: The Grudge was hailed as the scariest film of all time The Ring (the remake not the Japanese version) was the scariest film I have ever seen hands down and I've seen a lot. The Grudge was excellent. It is the story of a family, a wife and husband and a young boy, who lived in a house in Tokyo. The wife falls completely obsessively in love with an American Professor played briefly by Bill Pullman. The husband discovers his wife's obsession by reading her diary and in an unnatural fit of rage he murders his wife, his son, and their cat before killing himself. According to Japanese folklore when a person dies in a state of rage or deep emotion they leave a curse on the area where they died and it effects everyone who comes into that area. A new family moves into the home, an American businessman, his wife, and his mother. His mother is suffering from old age but the house pushes her into dementia as she barely clings to life being haunted by the dead Japanese wife, and son. The wife begins to torture and eliminate anyone and everyone who sets foot in the house where she was murdered. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen a volunteer caretaker who comes in to look after the elderly woman who has moved into the home. The story is much more complicated than it needs to be and yet at the same time doesn't really ever fully explain clearly what is happening. The scenes of horror creepiness are great and definitely send chills down your spine but they are far apart and are filled with rather slow paced middle story. The movie is almost more of a drama that has moments of scariness. In saying that the scenes of the dead mother and boy are deliciously filmed and are definitely worth a good jump. Sadly Shimizu does at times resort to the ""cheap scare"" tactics by making you jump in your seat rather than really going for the kind of psychological horror that I had hoped The Grudge would bring. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the best role I have ever seen her in. She really brings out the acting jibe in this one and granted she hasn't had a lot of opportunity to flex her acting ability but this one did it for her. She played her role perfectly. The Japanese cast including the little boy Toshio played by Yuya Ozeki were brilliant and creepy. Ozeki should have plenty of practise playing this role as this is his third reprisal in the role of Toshio having played him in the original version as well as it's sequel. Point of interest for some the entire Japanese family that plays the evil cursed ghosts are reprising their roles for the third time.I don't think anyone who enjoys a good scary film will be disappointed by The Grudge. It certainly didn't leave me scared to death and I actually felt after leaving the theatre that the film was mostly forgettable which is unfortunate but I hope to see it again as I do believe it will be around a long time as a horror classic.8/10",The Grudge
41,bowmanblue,Pretty creepy (if you haven't seen the original - apparently),8,27 September 2019,"I watched 'The Grudge' in 2004 and was really impressed. Then I learned it was a remake of a Japanese horror film and everyone who'd already watched that couldn't stop talking about how much worse this Hollywood remake was. However, seeing as I've never seen the original (shame on me), I guess I can still enjoy the movie for what it is... a tight little horror story.Sarah Michelle Gellar does her best to play 'Karen' - a character not quite so skilled in killing the undead when she begins her new job in Japan of taking care of a housebound old lady (Grace Zabriskie, from 'Twin Peaks' who seems destined to play these crazy, tortured souls!). Unfortunately, the house she lives in is haunted by a particularly nasty ghost (and just a plain weird ghostly little boy). Soon, Buffy... I mean Karen, finds she can't go anywhere without hearing an ominous throaty drone which seems to indicate that the ghost is about to make an appearance.Despite Sarah Michelle Gellar being the obvious star, there are also sub-plots involving other victims of the spook, namely Clea DuVall and Bill Pullman (don't let the opening scene where he kills himself fool you into thinking there isn't more to his story than just a cameo in the first shots). Because of this the movie does jump around a bit from one set of characters to the next. You have to stick with it to piece together how they are all related before the story finally gets picked up (proper) by Sarah Michelle Gellar, who's left to 'finish' the tale in the third act.I totally enjoyed the spooky atmosphere created and the setting of a Japanese city made a nice change from an American metropolis. There isn't too much blood and gore; instead you get spooky kills where much is left up to the viewers' imaginations. And, although you do see the ghosts pretty well, props to the film-makers who came up with the creepy drone-repeating click noise it makes when it's getting ready for the kill. I haven't watched 'The Grudge' in years, but the one thing I always remember is that noise!Now, I know a lot of similar style ghost stories came out in the 2000s (mainly after the success of the Hollywood version of 'The Ring') and 'The Grudge does suffer a little from being released after 'The Ring' as to setting the standards for movies. Yes, a few moments you may see coming, but it's certainly a lot better than many of the similar genre movies that came out after it and it's as watchable as ever today (even if the mobile phones are out of date!).",The Grudge
42,dromasca,pure horror - works quite well,7,15 February 2005,"I am interested in different type of cinema experiences, and my curiosity has been paid back lately with several Japanese-American productions, trying to play on the exoticism of the Japan setting, while bringing in more Hollywood cinema language and well-known actors. 'The Grudge' is no 'Lost in Translation', but it is still an interesting experience because the same director re-made his original all Japanese film for the American and European audiences. I will not comment on the differences or play 'who is better' game, as I did not see the original. I will just say that 'The Grudge' played quite well for me. There is not to much action in this film, but the horror theme is made credible by the cultural differences. Yes, we as individuals are intimidated by foreign cultures, we feel strange in a different landscape and not understanding the language, so horror is one step closer. Some of the plot line are expedited in a too simple manner, some characters are disappearing without too much explanation and before having created any emotional bound with the user, but still the scary experience is consistent, does not make any sentimental concessions and worked well for me. Acting is average plus, so was directing, and this simple piece of horror gets a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Grudge
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,I Grudge paying for this,1,20 November 2004,"Ugh! What nonsense. American remakes of Japanese horrors are all the rage at the moment. Between this, The Ring and a forthcoming remake of the rather weak Dark Water it seems as if Hollywood has tapped into a new well of unimagination.Which is weird, considering how pointless this remake is. Its only purpose is to serve those who cannot be bothered reading subtitles as the same director and some of the original cast remain as well as the fact that it's set in Japan. If they were bothering to remake it then why change 2 things? The presence of English dialogue and mostly new actors seems a vague reason to redo this film.As PG-13 rated horrors go, this one is still scraping the bottom of the barrel. Seriously, The Grudge is the dredge of horror. I've not seen the original, despite being 'asked kindly' to do so. But I could still see every scare coming. You just know because of the camera angles suddenly changing to an off-centre shot to accommodate something new. Either that or a scene of silence is built up so much that a sudden jolt is the only logical end.Unlike The Ring, there is no mystery to this film. It's all very straight-forward and, in the end, just boils down to typical slasher fare. Or scare-em-to-death fare as no one is physically killed in this film. Other than the Yoko character. Her fate made no sense and did not fit in with the internal 'logic' of the script. And can someone explain Bill Pullman's actions at the beginning for me?A very poor film indeed. Very repetitive, very slow and utterly pointless. As a horror film, The Grudge has as much integrity as Darkness Falls.This film is basically a cure...for NOT being asleep.",The Grudge

All the characters are fantastic, and i thought those weird noises were very frightening, plus Sarah Michelle Gellar is simply amazing in this!. This is my 2nd viewing after 1st having seeing it in theaters, it frightened me to death, and i started to panic, upon 2nd viewing it wasn't quite as scary, however it still scared the crap out of me, and i found the score pretty creepy as well, plus i thought Gellar and Jason Behr had very good chemistry together. The plot is hard to follow at times, as your wondering what the hell is going on, however it explains itself pretty good at the end in my opinion, plus the people who are calling this funny, are absolutely messed up in the head. It relies on a lot of jump scares, and boy do they ever work, and i thought the makeup effects were great, plus the ending was awesome!, and paves way for a sequel, and one of my favorite scenes is when KaDee Strickland's character Susan looks under the sheet, and has a surprise waiting for her. This is simply some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen in my life, with an amazing performance from Michelle Gellar, and i say go see it immediately!. The Direction is wonderful!. Takashi Shimizu does a wonderful job here, with amazing camera work, fantastic angles, constantly adding scary images, and very scary atmosphere, and doing a great job on making us the viewers scared (in my opinion)!. There isn't much gore. except a severed jaw, grotesque faces, blood here and there, a graphic fall victim, and other minor stuff. The Acting is fantastic!. Sarah Michelle Gellar is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, fantastic in the acting department, was vulnerable, had very good chemistry with Jason Behr, wa s very caring, and proved she can carry a lead role like a champ!, i loved her! as usual (Gellar Rules!!!). Jason Behr is very likable, and id what he had to do very well, he had very good chemistry with Gellar, and just did a great job. William Mapother is okay here as Matthew and did his job adequately. Clea DuVall is so so here, i am not a big fan of hers, so i wasn't really a fan of her in this one either, she did OK i guess. KaDee Strickland is hot and shows up to collect a paycheck and that's pretty much it. Bill Pullman is fantastic here, he looked awesome, and was just too cool, wished he had more screen time though!.Ted Raimi has a small role here and he did good. Rest of the cast do fine.

45,tabuno,"Excellent Execution, Flawed Ending",7,25 January 2019,"24 October 2004. The cinematographic and directorial technique were great in this movie, but the ending was a pretty miserable failure...unable to really provide the audience with any satisfying new twist on the hundreds of horror movies that have come before. The avoidance of the gory and literally, ghastly onslaught of over the top scenes and sights was a nice touch. This more subtle, sedate, but always ominous mystery builds throughout the movie with nice flashbacks and a great scene of juxtapositions between past and present that rates with any horror movie. The sound effects, the musical background (with some familiar strains from ""Wait Until Dark"" were effective. This movie wasn't scary in the classic sense, the emotional dread was more saturated like a wet, humid, cloying feeling. Not all of the strands of the movie were tied up by the end, there were lingering questions, and the climax was more of huge letdown. Seven out of Ten Stars (for good directing, but lost potential for a spectacular, memorable hit).",The Grudge

This is what happened in a certain house in a residential neighborhood of Tokyo, where there are mysterious deaths happening. After a visit, the young American Karen Davis begins to feel haunted and will research the history of the house, in search of a way to ward off the evil that pursues her. Directed by Takashi Shimizu, this film is different from almost everything I've seen in horror: what frightens us is the depth of the permanent tension felt throughout the film. Okay, I've never seen the original so I cannot see how close it is, but it did not fail to impress me. The script is good, the story is interesting and make me remember of ""The Ring"", with all the focus on investigating that dark history. Sarah Michelle Gellar is the protagonist, but she does not make a particularly interesting performance, like none of the actors. Despite this, it's a worth watching horror movie.",The Grudge
50,TheMovieDiorama,The Grudge begrudgingly latches onto croaky jump scares without logical cohesion.,4,3 November 2019,"This, is an unusual horror to review. It's rather uncommon for the same director, in this case Takashi Shimizu, to remake his own original film for an entirely different audience. Most would push their original creation onto the masses and convince them, with glorified persuasion, to withstand subtitles and invest the time into the chilling ghost story.Yet Shimizu thought it would be apt to direct his own film again. Admirable? Yes, it ensured he received total creative control over the studio and producers. Necessary? No. Somehow, by remaking the exact story with essentially the same spine-tingling sequences, Shimizu downgraded the atmospheric aura of 'Ju-On', resulting in nothing more than a Japanese ghost boy releasing his inner cat and his ethereal mother croaking the life out of anyone who visits the cursed house. That's the plot synopsis, right there.Well, there's a tad bit more to the mystery, however Shimizu's insistence on haphazardly fracturing the narrative between present day and the past week consequently confused audiences rather than enthral. There's no logic behind the structure. No foundational development. And certainly no characterisation. So the abrupt switching back and forth held no purpose, other than to illustrate a host of jumpy death sequences. Some effective apparitional imagery heightened the tension, particularly the surveillance footage sequence and bedroom scene that made me frightened of my own bloody duvet when I was an innocent boy, yet negated by the bland acting from every single actor.Buffy has no more vampires to slay or Daphne has solved all remaining mysteries (take your pick...), and so she's left wandering aimlessly around Tokyo with just one facial expression. Confusion. Pullman contributed nothing. And even Kayako herself, Fuji, was grossly misused during moments of tension-raising buildup. The final expositional flashback sequence, revealing to us why the house is now essentially cursed, was rushed and overwrought. Then concluding the entire feature on a frickin' jump scare that looked cheaper than Kayako's mascara. By the time the credits roll, you'll be thinking to yourself ""...why are these Americans in Tokyo anyway?"".I just...don't understand how Shimizu can make his remake so unprogressive in terms of quality. He had another shot at bettering his original, overcoming previous criticisms, yet failed miserably. I'm open to the idea that The Grudge is a product of its time, comprising of several horror traits that the previous decade had commonly exploited. And I appreciate it stuck to its J-horror roots. But damn, this has not aged well in the slightest. The core is there. I can visibly see the contents. Yet, either due to Shimizu's inability to improve in directorial control or studio interference, The Grudge growled like a ghoulish kitten instead of exhuming a ghostly lion's roar. Y'know, because Toshio opens his CGI mouth and a cat noise comes out? Urgh, whatever. Couldn't think of anything...",The Grudge
51,insomniac_rod,Regular ghost revenge flick.,4,1 May 2006,"The plot behind ""The Grudge"" is chilling but it takes too long before it gets interesting. The situations are slow moving but that's not necessary bad because it helps to grow interest on the main characters. Sadly, as most of the important events are told in flashbacks you keep forgetting about the lead female. Still, it's not a bad idea. This could be considered as a ghost revenge flick. Here, the supernatural elements are consequences of a tragedy occurred in real life. To be honest, this is the typical Horror movie that relies most of it's suspense moments on CGI. The movie is filled with false scares and CGI effects of ghosts. Don't expect tension or suspense. Think about ""The Ring"" but with a little more blood and you have basically the same movie. Even the ending (which is beyond ridiculous; almost as bad as in the ""Amytiville Horror"" remake) was inspired by those kind of movies. The direction and visuals are pretty good actually. The locations were perfectly selected for this kind of movie. The f/x were really good when required. The problem with CGI is that most movies like this one tend to abuse of it. Also, I didn't know Sarah Michelle Gellar was such a bad actress. She delivers a wooden, emotionless performance. The rest of the cast just does what they can. It's not that bad at all...Do yourself a favor and don't watch this over rated ghost movie. For a better movie of the likes of this movie, watch ""The Others"", or ""Supernatural"".

52,Anonymous_Maxine,Effective Japanese horror dulled by unnecessary remake and unnecessary CGI.,5,31 January 2009,"In perusing all the negative comments about The Grudge spread out among the IMDb, I'm amazed at how many people, even professional critics, have gotten the basic premise completely wrong. The curse that the movie is centered around is not created when someone dies in a horrible way, it's created when someone dies ""in the grip of anger."" The terrible rage that has consumed someone at the time of their death is what creates the curse, and then that rage consumes anyone that it comes into contact with, at which point it also renews itself.Not that it matters, however, for the most part, people have been tending to be right about the rest of the movie. It's a remake of a Japanese film of the same name, which was released barely a year before this one and was directed by the same guy and is, by the way, leaps and bounds better than this one. You know all this stuff. The infamous opening scene of the American version is certainly surprising and promises an interesting movie, but then the movie veers off in a completely different direction and for most of the time it seems like that first scene is completely unrelated.Ultimately, it is little more than your standard haunted house story, which is probably the oldest and weakest story in the horror book. If you make a movie about a haunted house these days, there better be something truly interesting about it, otherwise it is guaranteed to sink unnoticed into obscurity.Sarah Michelle Gellar, a veteran of bad American horror movies, enters the mix adding her unique brand of weak horror acting. She's a college student finally granted her long- standing wish to travel abroad, but unfortunately she gets placed in this house helping to care for an old woman suffering from dementia, which basically means she spends most of the time staring into empty spaces at ghostly things that no one else seems to realize are really there. Gradually, we come to realize that she's not just losing her mind, she's being driven insane by ghostly forces that simply won't leave her alone. Enter another couple, Jennifer and Matthew, who are also living in Japan temporarily, as the husband has business there. Clea DuVall, the most talented actor in the entire movie, plays Jennifer, and the becomes immediately unhappy with the whole situation. She is having major problems adjusting to life in Japan, unable to communicate, unable to read any of the packages on the food at the supermarket, etc. Basically many of the same troubles I had when I moved here to China two years ago. As is to be expected, weird things start happening.You get the idea. I have heard people defend the movie by saying that there is nothing to complain about, the ghosts act perfectly naturally by lashing out at anyone who comes near because of course they're angry about how they died and want to take it out on someone! Yeah, I can understand that, but a movie about that and nothing else? And not only one, but TWO movies? Is it too much to ask for more than exactly the same kind of story that he been being told for hundreds of years?Since I am an American living in an Asian culture myself, I had hoped that they would take the opportunity to use the combination of American actors in a Japanese film to give us some kind of cultural analysis, maybe even something that would compare the Japanese and American horror styles. The opportunities were endless, but they were all ignored in favor of simply Americanizing a Japanese horror film. And having seen more than my share of both styles of horror, I can tell you that Americanizing Japanese horror is not the way to make it better!",The Grudge

A remake of the Japanese hit Ju-On that is about as good as the original. The only thing that I found wrong with this Japanese redux was the content matter was toned down, other than that nit pick it was a great horror film to watch. This is the film that The Ring (2002) was supposed to be, Instead of being filled with a bunch of cheap thrills and nonsensical images, the direction and the shocks were actually effective.A foreign exchange student living in Japan is also a care giver in her spare time. During one assignment she goes to a house that has a reputation. A horrific murder occurred there several years ago. The father went insane killing his wife, son and even the pet cat!, now they all inhabit the house!! The real estate agent was more than pleased to get the house sold. But the house is cursed by several restless spirits. Who ever enters the house feels the wrath from the former residents. The four ghosts appear before the visitors. But in reality they might only be one mean entity. The anger and hate the people felt before they died managed to form into one evil presence.What I enjoyed about this film was the fact that the director was trying to make a film that is sort of an introductory to western audiences about Asian ghosts and legends. Instead of making a confusing movie that would annoy viewers (like The Ring (2002).If you like horror films then by all means watch the Grudge. You should watch the Japanese original Ju-On.

54,thinker1691,Japanese Ghosts and the haunted house,2,13 September 2005,"Japanese directors have it seems, acquired several successful techniques about movie making from the Americans. Most noticeable the dramatic art of fear. The gist of their story is of a particular house in Japan which has become the haunted residence of a violently murdered family. Having experienced a brutal crime, the spirits now infect any and all visitors who come in contact with the possessed property. The victims range from a visiting nurse to an American family, all of whom succumb to the mysterious menace. What the film lacks however, is story cohesion. Interlacing several mixed vignettes which drag a reluctant audience towards a set of Vandalistic monsters, who's intent is on absorbing their victims, rather than devouring them. Next, is the provocative appearance of the child spirit, which evokes a morbid prurient interest, but little else. Furthermore, with the exception of Bill Pulman and Ryo Ishibashi, as the detective, terror is held to a minimum.

When Karen arrives she finds the house in total disarray and her patient in mute shock. Unwittingly, Karen discovers the presence of murderous, vengeful ghosts, bent on destroying anyone who enters the house - and then passing along their plague to their loved ones.There's a legend in Japan, you see, that says that when a person dies in a state of sorrow or rage, that emotion remains behind to haunt others. Can Karen escape the curse and prevent it from ensnaring her boyfriend Doug? Whoa, not so fast, there. This is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, here, true, but she's not Superman. Surely Karen can't topple an ancient curse, right? Horror movies are all the rage now, which is good. Even better, the emphasis seems to be on suspense as much as it's on gore and whatnot. The Grudge trucks with the former much more than with the latter, which is also a good thing. It's an amusing, entertaining little film, and there's no slight intended. Rather than overwhelm the viewer's senses with loud noises and blood, director Takashi Shimizu opts instead for what lurks around the corner and under the bed. Yes, you do see some gross things (including an undead being that looks like it walked off the set of The Ring), but watching the movie isn't like stepping into a house of horrors in which what you see is what's scary. As with the scariest movies, what you don't see can kill you.Gellar is pretty good, considering she's been in movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer. The Grudge is leagues ahead of crappy teenyboppers-in-peril movies like that one (and Scream 2, in which Gellar also appeared), in terms of both style and story. Really, it's like the difference between Scooby Doo and Columbo. Sure, it's a fairly easy gig, playing a victim in a horror movie. And, of course, if you're pretty much the only ""name"" actor in the movie, chances are pretty good that your character is going to survive it, in one form or another. Even so, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Gellar essayed her character's abject terror, so kudos to her.Really, if I hadn't already seen The Ring, I might have thought this was even better than it turned out to be - although I did think it turned out better than I had anticipated.

The Japanese locations are very creepy because we're not used to it, Americans in a foreign country dealing with something supernatural is a very scary situation & it plays out perfectly.The Grudge is scary as hell with it's sense of dread, there was tons of supernatural Horror films out during this time as it was a great time but this is one of the absolute best.
This is a Horror-mystery with strong performances & brilliantly directed by Takashi Shimizu.",The Grudge
59,drownnnsoda,Creepy and Well Done Japanese Remake.,8,25 October 2004,"""The Grudge"" follows a young nurse, Karen, (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who lives in Tokyo, Japan, and is sent to work at an old house where an elderly woman is living. Unfortunately, the house has a horrible past and a curse was laid upon it - a curse that is brought upon anyone who dares to step into the house. What would have been a routine job for Karen becomes a nightmare where she must fight against good and evil and try and stop the curse from claiming her.This movie came out at the perfect time- just before Halloween, when most people are looking for a scary movie to watch. I will say that I enjoyed ""The Grudge"". Sure, it does follow some horror clichés (example: after hearing strange noises in the attic, you go explore with a lighter as your only light source) but I still enjoyed it for the most part and it works out as a decent horror movie overall.This film uses loads of ""jump"" scenes to scare you which are effective, but there were continuous ""jump"" scenes throughout this movie, which tend to be overused in today's horror films. This film could've been better if it had used more scare tactics, but ""The Grudge"" does have some really disturbing scenes that are also effective. I guarantee you will jump at least once throughout the movie, it has some unexpected scares. The only problem people may have with this movie is that it's hard to follow, and the film ends when you wouldn't expect it to. If you pay enough attention though, you should be fine, otherwise if you don't you will be lost. I've only seen a little bit of the Japanese original so I can't really compare and contrast the two, but if you're looking for some good scares, go see ""The Grudge"". It's well-written, well-acted, and has some splendidly scary scenes (the staircase scene was just flat out disturbing). I think I liked it better than ""The Ring"" myself. 8/10.",The Grudge
60,davispittman,It was alright....,5,6 November 2016,"The Grudge (2004) is an okay horror film. Sarah Michelle Gellar stars, and I think Sarah does do well in her role, but the cast/acting isn't really the issue I took with the movie. The problem I had with it was that it had many times where it was slow and just boring, didn't do a great job with keeping your attention. I also didn't enjoy Bill Pullman in his co-starring role, he didn't seem believable to me. The beginning isn't bad, but as the movie progresses towards the middle of the movie, it really does slow down. The visuals certainly aren't anything to write home about, just pretty average. I like Gellar, and I have enjoyed her in many roles, but I think this movie was a mistake, it just didn't entertain me and it seemed pretty average, maybe even below average at some points. 5/10 for The Grudge. My recommendation is to skip this one and keep looking if you're looking for a good horror movie that'll entertain and scare, there are plenty better ones out there.",The Grudge
61,aidanratesmovies,The Grudge (2004),3,14 August 2020,"Full of potential but lacking really any execution- The first remake of the japanese horror flick Ju-on: The Grudge is not only a dissapointment, but mostly a waste of time. The film is very unique with its way of telling the story, and though it can be hard at times to follow, and a bit messy, I can't help but praise it for trying to do something new. Sarah Michelle Gellar leads the huge and often random cast of characters we get to see in the film, and almost none of the actors prove to be memorable. There are a handful of few that try their best with the roles provided, those people being: KaDee Strickland, Bill Pullman, and Ryo Ishibashi. I do give the film credit to sticking to its setting of Japan, like so many other Japanese horror remakes decide against, but I can't feel like it made much of a difference, and it seems to just give this film less and less of a point to have been made. I haven't seen the original, although I do plan on watching it sometime soon. But I can't help but feel The Grudge (2004) is for the most part a dull imitator of its original, and has nothing really to offer horror fans and movie goers alike. It does have some decently creepy scenes throughout, but nothing too good to actually hold the film together. Interesting plot points begin, and end just as soon as the appear, and I can't help but feel that somewhere lost within this film is a potentially conceivable and very compelling horror story. In the end, The Grudge is forgettable, and has very little to offer. It tries at times, but isn't enough to provide for a decent viewing.My Rating: 3/10.",The Grudge
62,TOMNEL,It succeeded in being scary. Lots of good scares and creepy atmosphere.,7,18 June 2008,"There have been about a hundred American remakes of Japanese horror films recently, and the Grudge is the only one that worked for me. I saw this in the theaters and the mood in the film, and the audience was genuinely scared and tense. In fact, this is probably the most scary atmosphere I've seen in a recent horror film. The plot, the actors and everything else comes second to the scares and the atmosphere. Most movies would bother me if that was the case, but this one didn't. It was trying to be a horror film, and that's all it was, and a darn good one I must say.For some reason all the American remakes of Japanese flicks still take place in Japan, with American actors. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, a nurse who begins to take care of an elderly old lady at her house. The old lady is killed by a strange presence in the house, and Karen is plagued with a curse which is killing all the people around her and scaring the audience half to death.Jump scenes are a technique used by almost every ""teenager"" or ""slasher"" horror film, and they only cause quick scares that only catch those paying attention at that moment. There are a few jump scenes here, but most of the scares are built from the super creepy environment and the thought that we know something will happen, just when is it coming? The grudge ghosts were also pretty scary. When ""The Ring"" came out and it was touted as some sort of remake masterpiece for modern horror I felt I must see it. I was very disappointed. ""The Grudge"" opened to mixed reviews, none really praising it, and for scares and overall artistic direction, ""The Grudge"" was a triumph. The plot makes no sense, and that's one of the big problems with this movie. With a more logical plot, maybe this would have been a well reviewed movie. But throw the plot away for this one, I still enjoyed it! My rating: *** out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for terror and violence.",The Grudge
63,rbverhoef,Fans of the genre probably enjoy it,5,18 April 2005,"'The Grudge' is a horror film about a haunted house, although the characters are able to leave the house. Not that it really matters, once you have entered it you are doomed. Sarah Michelle Gellar is one of those people, Bill Pullman belonged to them three years earlier. The opening sequence involves the Pullman-character and it felt so good I thought this film might be pretty good. For me it was not, the first scene stayed the best, but I realized that a lot of people might enjoy this. I mean, you want it to be scary and I guess it could be for many. At least the person I was watching it with found it to be quite scary.My main problem here is that even when it is scary for some, the moments are created through the ways we have seen so many times before. Empty places and people alone, instead of walking away they take a look. Funny how people in the film are instantly scared when they hear a noise, even before they realize strange things are happening. The music tells us something will happen, the camera stays close to the character so things can enter the screen quite suddenly and then... well, most of the time something that has nothing to do with the story gives a reaction to most members from the audience. 'The Grudge' has these moments, although most of them actually do show us events that involve the story. I just didn't care much since we have the same approach here.Up to a level I guess I enjoyed it. For me some of the fun came from guessing what would jump in front of the camera, but again, my friend was actually scared at times. Therefore I must admit this film does the job better than most horror films. Films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'Wrong Turn' depend on gore, this one at least has the nerve to depend on the old simple tricks (keeping it a PG-13 rated film), apparently succeeding from time to time. If you normally enjoy this kind of film you will like this very much. If you want an interesting and intelligent story you should avoid this, it is as simple as that.",The Grudge
64,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Remake of a J-Horror Classic,8,11 January 2021,"This film I remember seeing for the first time not too long after seeing the American remake of The Ring. This one did throw me off a bit due to the story being told out of order, but it made me feel uncomfortable. Since then, I've seen this one a handful of times throughout the years and have seen the original Japanese version along with all of its sequels. I am coming back to this as I haven't seen this one in some time, but it did fall into the Podcast Under the Stairs Summer Challenge Series as I'm still working through that list. The synopsis here is an American nurse living and working in Tokyo is exposed to a mysterious supernatural curse, one that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim.As the synopsis states, we're in Japan. We are in the apartment of Peter (Bill Pullman) and his wife Maria (Rosa Blasi). He is out on the balcony and looks troubled. Maria wakes up and asks what he's doing. He doesn't respond, instead he slides over top of the railing falling to his death.We then shift to a woman of Yoko (Yôko Maki) as she makes her way to a house that she helps out in. There is an old woman who doesn't talk much of Emma (Grace Zabriskie). We learn that she has dementia and needs to have round the clock care. While Yoko is cleaning up the house, she goes upstairs to find Kayako (Takako Fuji). She is making a weird sound and pulls Yoko up before we cut awayIt then takes us to an apartment shared by Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Doug (Jason Behr). He is up trying to look for clean shirt to go to class. She wakes up to help him. We learn that doesn't have class today, but she has to pick up a book from a care center she volunteers at. As she stops in, her supervisor of Alex (Ted Raimi) asks if she can fill in for Yoko. She will check in on her patient as her first solo visit. Yoko didn't show up today for work.The house she goes to is that of Emma. Karen finds the house tore up much like Yoko did. Emma is laying by her bed where we see she urinated. Karen cleans her and the rest of the house. Upstairs she finds the closest door is taped shut. She hears noises inside and clears it away. Inside is a little boy named Toshio (Yuya Ozeki). Karen calls Alex to report everything she's encountered. When she goes back to Emma's room, she is talking to someone. When Karen asks about it and she states she just wants her to leave her alone. That is when something comes from the corner of the ceiling, terrifying them both.From here, the movie starts to fill in the events that got us here. This includes meeting Emma's son of Matthew (William Mapother) and his wife of Jennifer (Clea DuVall). They're moving here for Matthew's work and Emma will be staying with him. Also there is Susan (KaDee Strickland) who is Matthew's sister. We see as they're looking at the house there isn't something right. They don't necessarily completely understand and move in. Weird things start to happen to them. We also see a detective, Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) as he tries to piece together what is happening. He knows the history of the house, but as a detective, he can't believe it is supernatural. It becomes a nightmare for all those who encounter this cursed house.That's where I'm going to leave my recap and I'll shift this over to my thoughts on what this version does. I've already said that I saw this early into the ghostly J-horror movies and I really liked it. The last time I saw this movie, my rating went down a bit as I do think the actual Japanese takes are better. This one does have in its favor that the director is Takashi Shimizu, the writer and director of the original. I've come back up on this one for the following reasons.The first thing would be I like that this is still set in Tokyo. We have these Americans as the main characters to bring that audience in. This movie also plays on the idea of them being outsiders. Karen needs to ask directions and after being helped, we see the mother that she talks to hiding her daughter from her. We also get where Jennifer isn't enjoying her time here. None of them know the history of the house that the curse is in so that helps as well.That is where I want to take it next. The movie does have the title card in the beginning explaining what ju-on is. Where I think this movie has a bit of a misstep is not giving us a bit more of Toshio, Kayako or Takeo (Takashi Matusyama). We know how Kayako plays into things here with Peter. We also know what Takeo did. It is a bold move by Shimizu to not explain what a Japanese audience would recognize as normal haunting elements in their country. I get along fine seeing this since I have seen Ju-on: The Curse, it's sequel, along with the first remake of Ju-on: The Grudge along with the sequel there. Many Americans might not know this comes from this mythology. I also think most audience members would care as much as I do.Last thing with the story that I want to delve into woudl be that of Nakagawa. He is a detective, but I also like that he is willing to entertain the idea of the supernatural. Part of this could be that he is Japanese. As an American though, I'm used to the police not believing and many times it works to the story. I like here that it is breaking the norm though. He was also friends with the officers that worked the original case so he did get to see what happened there as well.I'll shift this over next to the acting. I really like Gellar's performance in this movie. I'll admit, I have a crush on her, but she also plays this out of place young woman very well. She has a good heart, wants to help those around her and is just nice all around. She fits the role very well. I think that Behr is fine as her counterpart. Mapother is solid along with DuVall. Strickland has one of the more creepier sequences in the movie and her fear is quite believable. Ishibashi is good in his role as the detective. I'm glad that htey got Ozeki and Fuji for their roles here. The latter is so creepy and pretty much always plays the role of Kayako. I also thought the cameos by Zabriskie, Pullman, Raimi and the rest rounded this out for what was needed.Then there would be the effects. The practical effects are good. We get a bit of blood here that looks real. The make-up that they do with Toshio and Kayako is really good. Once again the latter is very creepy here with the look on her face. How she moves really helps as well. This version does have some CGI, but I'll be honest, it worked for me. I didn't have any issues there and I was pleasantly surprised. There is also the cinematography which was well done on top of that.The last thing would be the sound design. The use of the creepy sound of Kayako works for me. I know that it is recording a comb, but it is effective. I don't believe this version explains why she makes that noise which is a safe. Toshio making noises like a cat is also quite creepy on top of that. The soundtrack aside from that fit for what was needed and does help to set the mood for sure.In conclusion, this movie I feel I unjustly came down on trying to defend the original where this is just a different take and incorporating different elements. That isn't to say that everything works. There are some things that I think are left out that could really help this movie in my opinion. The acting is good and the effects, both practical and CGI, work in the movies favor. I'd also say that the sound design and the soundtrack help to set the mood with making this movie creepier. I'd say this movie is a good movie overall, just lacking some elements for me to go higher.",The Grudge

66,nycritic,Disastrous Remake.,6,15 March 2005,"It helps seeing both the original, JU ON, and THE GRUDGE back to back to see why remakes just don't work most of the time and what one should never do in a horror film if the first version was already perfect. Rarely have they ever done so: except for Hitchcock's own re-telling of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1956, most of the times they have failed miserably. This one retells the same story, eliminating two major plot arcs from the first (the three missing students who were at the house with the haunted detective's daughter, and Mariko's storyline who served to expand on the curse, here served by Bill Pullman's storyline), and adding a boyfriend to Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen, as well as creating yet another brief role in the beginning -- the caretaker of the old lady, unseen in the first.THE GRUDGE is no exception to the rule of the unnecessary remake: While it does have one or two minor moments of silent dread as when Clea duVall's character meets her fate in the haunted house, the use of black tendrils and shock moments don't quite help bring the real horror, and Sarah Michelle Gellar conveys absolutely nothing in her scene when she is found crouched in a corner by the dead old lady (Grace Zabriskie), which negates the intense blankness that one could see in Megumi Okina's harrowed face in the original. I have a sneaking suspicion that this was a joint effort to capitalize on the success of JU ON and bring it (quite badly) upon the more complacent and less demanding American public. And while some of the elements of the Sakei family tragedy answers some questions, the essence of horror is to leave these questions partly answered, or unanswered. This always makes the insanity of what happens even more haunting, unsettling.",The Grudge
67,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Some story fumbling but an effective horror film,7,27 February 2021,"In horror films, spirits and ghosts are popular creatures used in hauntings and spook fests. Sometimes though, the incarnations featured in the US don't come across unique or creepy. With that, every now and then international influence helps rejuvenate an industry. Movies are no different when it comes to the US as well. Which is why this film was made, when Sam Raimi saw the original movie released in Japan under the title Ju-On (2002). Usually when a story is adapted into a foreign market, there is a loss in translation due to cultural differences. That doesn't seem to be the case here though, as this Americanized version of the film seems to be handled with just as much care.Directed by Takashi Shimizu who also directed the original Japanese film, the story is about transfer student Doug (Jason Behr) and his girlfriend Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who moved to Japan to receive caretaker credit. When an assigned caretaker doesn't report into work for a specific residence, Karen fills in only to discover something isn't right about the location of the house. Adapted by Stephen Susco in his first theatrical writing credit, the story is clearly disturbing in way that'll keep its viewer watching with intrigue. The person who lives at the house is Emma (Grace Zabriskie), the mother of Matthew (William Mapother), Susan (KaDee Strickland) and mother in law to Matthew's wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall). When Karen reveals to local police detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) that she saw a creepy child named Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) is when the plot thickens.Most of the characters depicted in this story are an interesting bunch. Sarah Michelle Gellar best known for her roles in Cruel Intentions (1999), Scooby-Doo (2002) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV Show, plays a likable lead even though she's not totally the main focus. The reason for this is the slightly disjointed execution from director Shimizu. In order to explain why this residence has a lingering spirit, the movie takes its audience through a series of different flashbacks at different times. They are not hard to follow, but the moments at which they begin and end feels like they're in the wrong place. Or at the very least could been shown at a different time in the story. Runner up to Gellar's performance was Ishibashi's role as detective Nakagawa. Rounding out the cast, the movie also has appearances from Bill Pullman, Rosa Blasi, Ted Raimi, Yôko Maki, and Takako Fuji.What also makes the story to this horror film entertaining is the inclusion of Japanese mythology. Based loosely on the belief on how it occurs, the title of the film appropriately lends to the nature of the disgruntled antagonist. Perhaps the only other component to the film that won't please in particular the gore hounds is the level of violence. It's not much, but considering it's a PG-13 rated film, that's rare. Plus, the original Japanese version didn't have any. Besides, ghostly apparition films are more psychological than they are gory. The effects are also very well put together despite its budget and year that it was made. Very little of it is CGI and the parts that actually show the spirit, look like stop-motion but are indeed the talent of the actor, which is very impressive to say the least.Camerawork was also skillfully shot for this picture. Hideo Yamamoto served as the cinematographer. Yamamoto also worked on the original One Missed Call (2003), another popular Japanese horror film and a year later would do the same for Tetsujin 28 (2005). As for music, the score was composed by famed gothic composer Christopher Young. Although part of the sound heavily relies on dark brooding soundscapes, Young did compose two main themes which in their own right are memorable for the franchise. Considering Young also composed other great works like Hellraiser (1987) and Species (1995), it's nice that director Shimizu chose him to provide the music for this film. Thankfully an album exists and has just the right amount of creep factor to it to entertain.The way the story is told can feel out of place and gore may seem light to those who want it, but that's not much compared to the entire experience. The plot which includes some Japanese culture is captivating, the visuals are good and the music is entertaining for the genre.",The Grudge
68,lewiskendell,"Bland ""horror"".",3,22 June 2010,"""Once you have become a part of it...it will never let you go. I'm sorry.""I remember thinking that The Grudge was a pretty good horror flick when I was a teenager. Scary, as well. Boy, I must have been easily entertained back then.I suppose it would be pretty frightening if an evil spirit attached itself to you in real life, and there was no way to break the curse. But seeing it happen as The Grudge portrays it is pretty meh. This movie simply isn't scary. It relies on the simplest of jump scares, and it's only very often that they actually startle you. Scenes suddenly end and move on to the next, without ever explaining what happened to the characters in the missing time. People see things that would have any normal human being freaking out, and then carry on with whatever they were doing, as if nothing untoward happened. I haven't visited Japan, but I'm pretty sure that seeing vanishing, drowned ghost boys is so common there, that it doesn't cause much comment. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a role that is so bland, that it hardly counts as a character. And she's the most fleshed-out of the entire bunch. Even the short runtime seems too long for what actually happens. The Grudge may have been passable back in 2004, but no longer. See Ju-on, instead. Or any of the other superior horror movies that have been released since then.",The Grudge
69,philip_vanderveken,"I had a good time watching this movie, even though I'm not a very big fan of horror movies",8,2 February 2005,"I'm not familiar with Japanese horror movies at all and to be honest I'm not really a big fan of horror movies in general. Why I don't like horror movies all that much? Certainly not because I'm easily scared. It's because most of the time all that is considered as horror is rather stupid, predictable and too messy.A more than average, even intelligent horror movie is sometimes very rare and hard to find. The average horror movie is about at least one pretty, young blonde girl being chased by a madman and being cut open with a giant blade while almost screaming her lungs out. Another common theme is vampires or cannibals trying to get into a house with probably very juicy looking people, so they can eat them alive. One thing they all have in common: You'll see gallons of blood flowing and you almost start wondering if you shouldn't have put a bucket under your TV.The only reason that I did go to see this movie was because one of my friends absolutely wanted to watch it. I didn't expect much of it, but big was my surprise after seeing this movie. I actually had a good time! The beginning of the movie is ""impressive"" to say the least (Bill Pulman jumping of the balcony without saying a word to her, as his wife says to him that he is up early) and the story was very interesting. I liked the idea (based on a Japanese legend) that if someone dies in great anger or sadness, his or her soul remains at that place and functions as some kind of curse that wants to destroy all people who come into that same place. Finally a horror movie with a more original approach (yes, I know that it is a remake, but I haven't seen the original, so for me this is all new). This was actually a rather clever, well-crafted horror movie, but if there is one thing that I didn't like about the movie, it is Sarah Michelle Gellar. I've never been a fan of her and in my opinion she only got this role because she is seen as THE perfect lure for the teenage male audience. You know, the guys who probably all have at least 2 posters of her hanging on their walls, fantasizing about her when being alone (I don't even want to think of what more they do with it)... If the role of Karen had been played by for instance Nicole Kidman I would have liked it a lot more. But OK, it wasn't so, I better stop whining about it.Overall this is a very good horror movie that has a lot of suspense to offer. Most of the time you know that something is going to happen, but the hint is given in such a way that it doesn't bother (the same technique Hitchcock used to use in his movies). ""The Grudge"" shows that a good horror movie doesn't need to be filled with monsters or gallons of blood, but that things you don't know or see can be more terrifying. I liked it a lot and I give it an 8/10.",The Grudge
70,Chase_Witherspoon,Oriental fright night,9,12 October 2012,"Compelling horror movie with a particularly jarring sound effect that while sounds like a noise you make in the back of your throat, is surprisingly effective at conjuring some truly nightmarish images. SMG stars (don't let that deter you though) as an aged carer living in Japan while her boyfriend chases his dream (Behr) when the woman for whom she's caring (Zabriskie) dies suddenly from unexplained forces that continue to haunt SMG and anyone with whom it comes into contact. Local police regard the crimes as being sub-human and inevitable, able to do little as the tainted house and its far-reaching curse claim more victims.More than a little reminiscent of ""The House Where Evil Dwells"" (1982), this American version of a highly successful Japanese movie (""Ju-on"" 2002) is quite tense and although not especially gory (perhaps one memorable moment in the hallway of the school), still packs a punch. SMG is cute in her pixie, upside-down smile kind of way, and the supporting cast including Bill Pullman, KaDee Strickland, Ted Raimi, William Mapother and Grace Zabriskie are all pretty effective.Director Shimizu (who also directed the Japanese version) seems pretty capable in building almost unbearable suspense, delivering more than your average 'haunted house' picture. If there's one, mild criticism it's the Bill Pullman character connection was a little under-played, with only limited explanation for his character's relevance, though he does enjoy a couple of the more surreal and terrifying moments. Simple stuff, well told.",The Grudge
71,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Grudge"" is a decent Americanized Remake of the Japanese original, but it pales in comparison, and has many small issues holding it back from being a great remake...",6,14 October 2013,"This is one of those reviews that's hard to write, if for no other reason than I feel that the score I am giving this film (a 6 out of 10) may be somewhat misleading. And it was a hard choice. I bopped back and forth between giving it an ""average"" score of 6 and a ""pretty good"" score of 7. But I had to fundamentally stick to my guns and give it the score I feel it deserves.Takashi Shimizu directs this 2004 American remake of his own 2002 release ""Ju-On: The Grudge."" (Which itself is the third film in an ongoing horror-movie series over in Japan, although it is the most well- known entry overseas, where the first two films have yet to see release) And it is a fairly faithful adaptation of his prior film, albeit with some large changes both in content and style to accommodate the mostly American production and the aim at a wider western audience.The film, much like Shimizu's original, follows a non-linear series of short story-vignettes set in Japan. These vignettes piece together like a puzzle to tell a much larger story of the effects a ghostly curse has on various people unfortunate enough to feel its grasp. The dominant focus is on Karen Davis, portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar, an exchange student in Japan who volunteers as a caregiver for elderly and disabled people to fulfill a college credit requirement. We also follow the impact the vengeful spirits have on the Williams family, an American family who was forced to relocate to Japan for work-related reasons. (Portrayed by actors including KaDee Strickland, William Mapother, Clea DuVall and Grace Zabriskie)The acting is uniformly good, although (similar to the original) some of the characters are under-developed and serve as little more than canon- fodder. Gellar sticks out as the only character with much development, and she does a great job with the material. Strickland, Duvall and Zabriskie also do great work with their small roles, which unfortunately almost exclusively boil down to nothing more than a few lines of dialog before screaming in fear during the scares. The other big standout is Japanese veteran actor Ryo Ishibashi as a troubled police detective all too familiar with the curse of the house. While he only has a few scenes, he's a lot of fun and does command the screen quite well.The production is also very competent, although I find it to be more troubled than the original. Shimizu, who was given a larger budget for this film and obviously a lot more ""toys"" and sets to play with behind- the-scenes, does set up his scares quite well. And his visual direction is generally well put-together. However, I did find that he almost degenerated slightly at times. His original film was a much more claustrophobic, slow-burning thriller, and it made the scares land so much harder as a result. This film feels more sanitized to me in terms of direction. His camera-work has a lot less ""character"" to it, and does feel a touch bland at times. But I won't complain too much.The rest of the production is quite nice. The set and costuming is very natural, the photography is basic and works for the atmosphere, and the music from veteran composer Christopher Young is quite nice.I suppose my fundamental problems with this film, despite a strong production and a capable cast, is that it feels like an unneeded and slightly inferior remake. Outside of the Americanized casting (which really felt pointless- why not just cast Japanese actors, or set the film in America with American actors?), the film is strongly similar to the original, with the only major changes being a few scenes that were dropped or added. And due to the more sanitized direction and loss of the ""character"" of the filmmaking, it just feels like an inferior rehash too often.I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's a very decent remake, and I do enjoy it, but it just didn't quite live up to the promise and quality of the original film. I know I shouldn't be thinking about that and that I should rate this film on its own merits, but it's just too big an issue to ignore. And honestly, if the original film had these issues, I wouldn't hold it in nearly as high a regard.As it stand, this is a remake worth checking out, as it is still definitely one of the stronger remakes to emerge from the ""remake craze"" of the past 15 years. (Which was arguably kicked into high gear by the outstanding American remake of ""The Ring"") But it isn't one of the best. (Though thankfully it is exponentially better than any of the trashy Platinum Dunes remakes that have been polluting cinemas for almost a decade now)I give this a decent, slightly above average 6 out of 10. (I'd give the original a good/very good 8 out of 10) It's creepy, it'll definitely give you chills... it's just not as good as the original.",The Grudge
72,udar55,Nail in the coffin for Japanese horror,1,5 February 2006,"I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."" That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the ""curse"" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:-person walks into house-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard -person goes to investigate-sound starts to get loud-person sees a ghost-loud scream and/or cat screech-cut to blackBefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end ""with a loud scream and a cut to black."" We were never proved wrong.The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $15 million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the ""scariest movie ever made."" I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?",The Grudge
73,stensson,"Can we have a plot, anyone?",5,5 February 2005,"Japan has a somewhat unhappy love story with Western culture and Takashi Shamiza is part of that. They might be good in learning the techniques, but usually miss the humor and the irony. Just trying to make copies isn't enough, however good the copy might be.There have been less clever horror movies than this one. There are some jump scenes here that (almost) make you freeze, even if you know that such a scene is coming, but the plot isn't narrated in a good way. Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't look scared enough and why does she have to go and check out the strange sounds in the house? Hasn't she seen any horror movies before? The script isn't logic, not even according to spooky film standards. This movie is just an average one in its genre, which means it's not a must. Not at all.By the way, it's strange finding that this has a PG-13 level in USA. People dies here, but that's all right for children to watch. Had there been any bare breasts, the R rate had probably been put on without discussion, even if the film was a total feel-good one. But maybe God wants it that way.",The Grudge
74,mjw2305,Didn't do it for me,5,9 January 2007,"The Grudge is a very simplistic horror flick with very little in the form of a plot. Basically Sarah Michelle Gellar is a nurse who goes to work in Tokyo, she encounters an evil spirit that posses its victims and claims their souls, before moving on to the next victim. The premise behind this is that when a person dies a terrible death, it leaves behind a curse that in turn takes another life in a terrible way, and so on.I thought the film created a creepy atmosphere, and had some cool imagery, but overall it was just way to dull for long periods. I don't think its the Japanese style that caused it, because i really enjoyed the Ring; perhaps this is just an inferior film - yep, i reckon that's the reason.5/10",The Grudge
75,MartianOctocretr5,Barely mediocre; doesn't do justice to the original version,5,17 February 2008,"The makers of this film should be butchers at a grocery store, chopping up meat. They're experts in the field of hacking up a good thing. In short, this is an unnecessary remake. Typical of its ilk, it fails to even approach the movie it imitates. The few moments that are effective are those culled directly from Ju-On, the original Japanese version. The classically creepy security video camera sequence, which ran chills down your spine in Ju-On, becomes in this homogenized remake no more interesting than watching a security camera aimed at a vacant parking lot. That's only one example of many scenes that are made bland.It's good the film is set in Japan; it gives a cultural edge to the story that makes the legend and the curse believable and formidable. But that begs the question: why redo it at all? The scenes inserted with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Bill Pullman, apparently intended to add some back story about the people who had once lived in the house, really add nothing to the actual focus of the story. Not to mention that Gellar's acting is, quite frankly, sadly lacking. She looked like she was doing skits from a Sesame Street episode, rather than a horror flick.If it's on free TV, then it's just watchable. However, for a real horror movie experience, the original version is far better.",The Grudge
76,Maciste_Brother,Impressionistic horror film,7,5 May 2007,"After seeing the Hollywood remake of THE RING, I wasn't expecting much for this remake but I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. It doesn't add to much, there are no performances worth mentioning, the action is static and there is an element of predictability permeating the entire project but even with all these negative aspects, I still enjoyed the final result and THE GRUDGE works surprisingly well not as an all-out horror story but more as an impressionist styled horror.I'm usually bored with the current crop of PG-13 horror films. They're extremely anemic in quality and offer nothing new for the fading genre that's filled with unnecessary remakes and sequels. And THE GRUDGE would appear to fall into this category but it doesn't because the ""deconstructed"" direction works beautifully here. THE GRUDGE remake is a fine addition to the genre and I actually wish more horror films would take this impressionist approach, which is all too rare for something from Hollywood, than the SCOOBY DOO level spooks inflicting most horror films, which wouldn't impress a 5 year old.THE GRUDGE remake is well worth seeking out.",The Grudge
77,BrandtSponseller,Just as good as the Japanese films (but with an ending rant against remakes of foreign films),9,4 February 2005,"Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma's home, and she attempts to ""see how deep the rabbit hole goes"".Maybe it's a delayed influence from the success of M. Night Shyamalan's films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. In some cases, such as Hide and Seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as White Noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. I didn't like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. One, it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju-On (2000) (in particular, it's extremely close to the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge, aka Ju-On 3, from 2003). Two, as with many Japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror, The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.Director Takashi Shimizu, also the director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju-On series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the Ju-On series). Traditionally, American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning ""rules"" for the ""monster"". A more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S.However, even if you're not used to it, it's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot. This is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of ""main characters"" (which is done better here than the more episodic Ju-On 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out Gellar's clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emma's house, when Gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material.Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore. Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, it's interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a ""here's what really happened"" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10.Now that I've said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: It's not that I'm anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release. There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, I'd rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just Japanese, but also Indian, Spanish, Chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.",The Grudge

I do notice style and that is why I gave this movie a very high rating. Yes, a 5 is a high rating for such a boring and non-entertaining film.

81,film-critic,There is something evil there.,10,7 April 2005,"I will be completely honest with you, I watched this film with my finger on the fast-forward button pressed heavily so that the jumpy scenes wouldn't make me change my pants. I thought that this was one of the spookiest films that I have seen. Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences. While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film. The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films. Normally, there is this big ""jumping out of the darkness"" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of ""here I am"" that frightened me more than most films do.Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan. This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue. I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan. This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film. It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew. I thought that this kept the entire film grounded. It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning  there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America  we were in Japan. This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film. I was impressed.The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project. Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film. Gellar was the exact same. She did her part, collected her money, and went home. This wasn't what frightened me about this film. I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting. I expected average acting and that is what I got. What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film. That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals. His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest. Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work. It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released. This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.Overall, I loved this movie. It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for. There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula. There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre. This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film. From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared. This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film! Grade: ***** out of *****",The Grudge
82,mentalcritic,The chore,2,23 November 2004,"This, the latest in the trend of remaking Japanese horror films, is a chore to watch. I can only hope the original is better than this, because if the original resembles this remake in any way, it signifies that Hollywood really has too much cash for its own good. It defies belief that a film could make one feel that a good half of its running time is redundant or unnecessary, yet another twenty minutes of well-made footage would make it seem a lot more coherent.Sarah Michelle Gellar, much like her hubby before her, seems to feel her star fading with every second of this feature. In this effort, she plays a young exchange student I will refer to as Buffy simply because she never gives the character enough of an individual personality to distinguish it from the role that made her famous. So anyway, Buffy works for what appears to be a healthcare service for invalids in Japan. Her task is to clean up the mess that these invalids make on themselves, or so the scenes here imply.Strangely, the job she goes to in this film involves a grandmother who she finds with no sign of relatives around. The way the family has disappeared is hinted at, but only revealed after what feels like eight hours has gone by. Adding to the pace problem is the fact that the time seems to jump back and forth like a breakdancer, accompanied by more fades to black than even Peter Jackson resorted to in order to compensate for his poor storytelling skills. Indeed, cause and effect are very hard to follow in this film. So much so that the deaths seem inconsequential.What The Grudge does have going for it are some very creepy effects shots. The sequence in which the shadow creeps up to a CCTV camera and its eyes suddenly become visible is one of the few parts of the film that lives up to the hype. If only the ending shot didn't seem like such an obvious pilfering of The Ring. When the dialogue comes along, it is either indecipherable or just plain boring. It is never a good idea to bore your audience so thoroughly in the first hour of your film and save all the explanations for thereafter. In all fiction, there is generally an unspoken rule that if you fail to hook your audience in the first couple of minutes, you never will succeed.I gave The Grudge a two out of ten. If Sarah Michelle Gellar was hoping to resurrect her career with this first-draft mess, then she is sorely mistaken.

84,jon.h.ochiai,Really Didn't Care,5,8 November 2004,"I went to a screening of Takashi Shimizu's ""The Grudge"" at the USC Film School. The screening also included a question and answer session with the Screen Writer, Steven Susco, which was very cool. I met Steven-- he is a great guy and talented. As context, Susco really adapted the story of Shimizu's ""two"" ""Grudge"" movies that were produced in Japan. In this American version of ""The Grudge"", Susco attempted to fill in some of the narrative or contextual gaps that plagued the original films-- which were otherwise very popular and successful in Japan. Susco worked with Shimizu on the screenplay, and Shimizu also directs this remake of his original work. As part of the post-screening discussion, Susco related a story involving the reason for a certain character making a particular sound. We then all realized that reason was not revealed in the movie-- which was very annoying. Realize this is taken contextually. The other rather interesting insight, was the point of view that in Japanese horror movies as opposed to American, the protagonist does not necessarily find a resolution in Act III. That maybe an oversimplification of Japanese culture, but it is an interesting point. Even with it's shocking opening sequence with Bill Pullman as Professor Peter Kirk, and his wife played by Rosa Blasi, ""The Grudge"" does it's very best to scare from abrupt sounds and sights, and creepy imagery. The production values are solid. I suppose it is all scary, but the fact that you never have an emotional investment or affinity for the lead character is truly scary. In this the movie ultimately fails, because you never really care about Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen Davis. Her Karen Davis is a university student in Tokyo who is caught up in perpetuating curse or ""grudge"". She is thrust upon this fate when she substitutes as caretaker of an ailing and aged woman, whose family are also Americans living in Tokyo. Shimizu and Susco interleave flashback and visions to explain some of what happened. In all of it, Gellar's Karen comes off as the complete ""victim"", and there is nothing really heroic in her actions. This is where ""The Grudge"" really didn't work for me. Granted this not really Gellar's doing, and more a pitfall of the story-- there is nothing courageous in the fight. And if hopeless was the intended message of this movie, then that is disappointing and not at all inspiring.",The Grudge

Sarah is beyond gorg. The Grudge creates a circumstantially immersive storyline which allows for a no-need-to-wait-for-the-scares premise which I just love. They just keep coming. Similar to The Exorcist maybe. This is a classic movie which happens to be about how when a person dies in an absolute fit of rage then a curse is born at the place where that person's death occurred becoming a temple for a haunting, very dark spirit manifesting itself as tiny little disturbed, kinda cute but really paralyzingly spooky and terrifying Japanese kids with straight unkempt hair, ghostly, blurry white skin with crazy googly eyes and supernatural powers too. Actually, the curse consumes the spirit. The Grudge is really good and a really nice flick to watch to relax to. Like one of the best nighttime thrillers! The perfect date movie! Sarah Michelle's great! I love The Grudge! Sarah Michelle Gellar is ideal for this role and is so underrated in life and in the marvelous movie world! Words cannot describe The Grudge just go see it for yourself. It's not good to hold on to grudges, I love Sarah Michelle Gellar.(Bill Pullman, Jason Behr, KaDee Strickland, & Clea DuVall costar)",The Grudge
86,petra_ste,The drudge,5,27 August 2007,"Japanese folklore features a wide array of different monsters, or Yōkai, but you'd never know from Hollywood movies. This remake is another horror about one of those black-eyed, ghostly kids crawling on walls, meowing and killing a score of one-dimensional characters. It has three or four unsettling moments - which worked better in the original Ju-On - but also a paper-thin plot and an utter lack of characterization. These are not people, they are walking props for the next jump scare.One of the few ideas which work well is how the film is not told in a linear fashion, but unravels slowly with strategically-placed flashbacks. This back-story is not particularly compelling, but at least the movie doesn't spoon-feed the audience right from the start.Watch the original, Nakata's Dark Water or Verbinski's The Ring instead.5/10",The Grudge
87,fernandoschiavi,"Following the Japanese horror primer, the film presents flaws but it is ready to innovate western terror and teach us to enjoy the best of supernatural terror",6,1 November 2021,"In the wake of the success of Samara and The Ring, Western interpretations for stories of vengeful spirits began to enter the agenda of American achievements, an industrial segment that is very interested in reformulating pre-established materials in other cultures. With The Grudge, filmmaker Takashi Shimizu brought to the United States some elements of Japanese horror, to later take them back to the Japanese environment. Let me explain: one of the questions posed by the filmmaker during the making of the film was the setting of the story, with American characters, but with dramatic development in Japan, a strategy to maintain its connections with its culture, after all, Shimizu didn't even speak English at the time and an interpreter followed the entire process in the studio.The Grudg eis a remake of Ju-On, a low-budget film directed by the same director Takashi Shimizu. It tells the story of Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a social worker who is on exchange in Japan with her boyfriend (Jason Behr). One day she is assigned to babysit a slightly autistic old American woman (Grace Zabriskie) when former assistant Yoko (kitten Yoko Maki) mysteriously disappears. The day she takes care of the old lady Karen sees a spirit that leaves her in shock and kills the old lady. From then on, the film is told with a fragmented narrative, with comings and goings in time, even showing how the old woman's family acquired the house in Japan, in addition to all the curse that surrounds the place.As we know, in the mythology of The Scream, when someone dies in a situation involving hate, a curse soon sets in. In this case, it is the house where those involved in the story live that served as the basis for all the evil in the plot, that is, the murder of Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Toshio (Yuza Ozeki), entities that constantly appear to claim the lives of those that cross their respective paths. From its discovery to the process that follows, the narrative comes back and forth, presents some fragmentations, kills a number of people along the way and ends its journey of horror with the unfortunate endings, typical of oriental productions, stories that in their translations into Western audiences, gain more explanatory clothes, with a view to meeting the demands of spectators on ""this side"" of the planet.Under the supervision of Sam Raimi and Robert Taport in production, the remake brought the aesthetic elements of the version that serves as a starting point, reworked features and developed with more resources. Thus, the film does not fail in its attributions as a language: Hideo Yamamoto's photography direction is effective, as are the sets and art direction, signed by Kyôko Yauchi and Tatsuo Ozeki, respectively, members of Iwao's production design team Saito. The visual effects of Kory Jones reinforce the scary character of Kayako and Toshio, entities that take on greater contours thanks to the formidable sound work of the production, from the score to the sound design. In music, Young, experienced, employs the necessary elements to allow us to deepen the ""climate"", reinforced with the sounds developed by the team of Paul N. J. Ottosson.When it comes to directing the western remake, The Grudge (The Grudge, 2004), Shimizu has a number of technical advantages at hand. Improved visual effects make scares more effective, as happened with The Ring (by Gore Verbinski, 2002). The non-linear narrative remains the same, the broad reach of the spiteful spirit. Many plans are even identical to the original ones, of course greatly improved and using as few special effects as possible. According to director Shimizu in the 'making of'that accompanies the DVD, the more you use digital effects that don't look real, the more the horror element is used, and that's absolutely true. Unlike The Ring, The Grudgeis not an overdose of visual effects, the ones that exist are necessary to the story. But the director is faced with a paradox: he needs to give space and value the star Sarah Michelle Gellar in a story that, as we have seen, has strength for not enshrining any character.Gellar doesn't seem to be able to fully live the experience of the film, the actress seems emotionless on screen, not thrilled in her escape and even less in the great peak of the film, contrary to what we ended up seeing in the supporting cast. Clea DuVall looks like a fish out of water in the city, but stars in a beautiful clash scene with Kayako, Ted Raimi has very little screen time, but has an exciting conclusion when faced with the spirit of Yoko, but the award for best sequel Damn it to KaDee Strickland, who shows more screen presence in her clash with Kayako than Sarah does in the entire movie, making us wonder what the movie would be like if the executives had reversed roles, given KaDee the lead role and Sarah the supporting role, perhaps this had been the crucial choice to correct the problems that exist in the film. Another great merit of the production is that it has kept its original antagonists, Kayako and Toshio are perfect as they are, and the choice not to Americanize the characters makes it even more engaging.Where there really is a problem is in the dramatic area, prior to development, because the conduction of the irregular material itself presents an excellent command of language by Shimizu, a filmmaker who, after the cinematographic and television versions of the characters in this universe, already knows exactly what do and where to do to make your movie gimmicky. The story just isn't more engaging because the dramatic needs and character profiles aren't very well developed. And when that happens, there is no catharsis. Without catharsis, we don't care who dies or lives. In the realm of terror, after all, it would be tedious to stand in front of a movie just to get sporadic scares, without any dramaturgical connection with the creatures that circulate before the story, a kind of representation of ourselves, human beings who can also be affected by unexpected and unexplained situations of fate, such as the great characters in the tragedies of our millenary tradition. In all versions of The Scream, evil prevails, realistically. There is no escape.This American adaptation is a very atmospheric, thought-provoking story with good horror moments, such as the shower scene, the scary elevator approach and the part involving a staircase, in addition to its technical trump cards, with studio ""Japan"" Well built by technical production team. What leaves the film with less impact is the randomness of its plot, as all versions of Kayako, whether Japanese or American, present the same narrative scheme. The holes also bother. Why do some characters access the house and not die like others? Is this a requirement aimed at our interest in fictions with all narrative schemes connected or does O Cry actually fail in its mission to build the dramatic elements of the story, perhaps relegated to give more space to scares and excellent dissemination of terrifying sound representations?The Grudge is not that movie with a beginning, middle and end, it reports an event in the house, but it does not seek to bring a little pattern that has a well-defined beginning and ending, on the contrary, the film does not have a beginning and no end, leaving it open enough space to have prequels and sequels that don't feel forced while tying together enough to work alone. Following the Japanese horror primer, the film is ready to innovate western terror and teach us to enjoy the best of supernatural terror, showing us that terror doesn't have to end with happy endings, leading us to a remarkable ending that proves that terror doesn't it needs scary images, screaming trails or scandalous scares to be really scary.",The Grudge
88,gregsrants,Disappointing,4,28 October 2004,"Here are just some of the reasons why I will never have to worry about the ghost in The Grudge actually causing me some harm or in anyway scaring me to an institutional type state. One: Whenever I hear a noise in a darkened creepy place, I never go to investigate. No way. No how. Hear something banging in the attic someone else can go look. Hear rumblings in the cellar you go. I have seen too many movies, read too many books and heard too many stories to put on a brave face and investigate just for the sake of securing my curiosity.Two: My cat never jumps in front of me making a very loud noise while a booming musical score peaks for dramatic effect. My cat is tame and hides from me unless it is hungry. It is not an evil cat. It doesn't snarl and I am sure that if there were evil in the house, the cat would be the first thing to hightail it outta there. My cat pulls a stunt like that one time, and it is off to the shelter where it can terrify another sorry assed stranger.Three: If I ever see something boarded up, it stays boarded up. Who am I to start tearing down something that someone obviously felt necessary to either stop something from getting in or worse, getting out. Hell, if I went home and my bedroom was boarded up, I am sleeping in the kitchen until such time as I can move. End of story.Four: If I ever see police tape around a house, I ain't going' in. Who do you think I am, Agent Mulder? Yellow tapes means something bad has happened and bad begat badder. It means stay out, and I tend to follow instructions rather well.Five: If I ever felt a hand coming out the back of my head in a shower, it is see ya' later bathroom! I wouldn't stop to pack a bag or call a friend. One experience like that and I am out the door never to return again. Whether I ever shower again or not is another story, but you can be assured that I want nothing to do with that particular room again. If I am in a strangers house, it's a 'don't call me, I'll call you' hasty exit. If I am in a foreign country, it is a direct route to the departures lounge and if (and God I hope not) it is in my own home, you are welcome to a viewing as there would be a FOR SALE sign in the front lawn within hours of the incident.With these five simple plans of action listed above, I can't imagine that I would be in the minority, and yet, these situations and character actions occur at random intensity in the off-putting new film The Grudge starring Buffy star Sarah Michelle Gellar. Based on the Japanese film Ju-On The Grudge, the Hollywood edition at least made us stand up and take notice when they announced that director Takashi Shimizu would remake his own film in English. Also interesting was the casting of Gellar not-so-fresh off her long television run as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and in need of a character stretch after playing Daphne in the two gawd-awful Scooby-Doo pics. With Ju-On being a slightly better than average ghost story, the recipe for success was there for the taking.That just makes it all that more unfortunate that the film would fail so miserably. Instead of scaring us or bringing anything new to the table, the movie falls on the laurels of past horror films and gives us a story shot out of sequence (for no reason that I can ascertain) that is more frustrating than thrilling. Gellar looks absolutely lost as the main character, Kare Davis and Bill Pullman has a useless role that was probably offered to him just so they could add another name to the marquee. On the terror meter, The Grudge also has very little to offer. The noises that the ghosts make are almost laughable and the blood and gore content was carefully plotted so that the PG-13 rating could apply.Being October and so close to Halloween, we can expect these types of films to show up in our local playhouses in the next few weeks in hopes of a box office bonanza. Too bad they didn't try to capitalize on a good story as well.",The Grudge
89,Vivekmaru45,"The U.S. remake is action-oriented, and pacier but is tamer than the original Japanese one.",6,31 January 2011,"It seems to me that Takashi Shimizu was bound by certain constraints when he made this one. And it seems to me this film does not bear his mark whatsoever or do full justice to him.The original Ju-on had a much deeper story to it and is also more disturbing. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do so NOW!The actors in the remake are the dumbest bunch of losers you could get with a dime. And I never did like Sarah Michelle Gellar.The C.G.I. effects run rampant in this version to the point of the film becoming a joke. I saw the U.S. version first and the original Japanese film much later. And boy did I feel CHEATED by the U.S. version. Plot: Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student who takes a job as a care worker to obtain social studies credit. Karen finds a closet that's been taped shut with cat-like noises coming from it. When she rips off the tape and opens the door, she finds a little boy (Toshio). The boy refuses to come downstairs so she asks him for his name. ""Toshio,"" he says, in a toneless, eerie voice. Emma begins stirring and muttering in the other room. As Karen calms her, a dark shadow of hair emerges from a corner of the room...which soon reveals to be a face of woman covered by her hair. The woman's hair, which was covering her face, flies back to reveal the whites of her eyes. The irises roll into place and focus on Karen as she backs away in fright and then faints due to sheer terror. Karen wakes much later in Hospital. Karen tells her story to detectives, emphasizing the appearance of a boy. Over the next few days, she is constantly tormented by Kayako, in her shower, on a bus (while with Doug), etc. Frightened but determined, she starts research on the history of that house on the Internet by searching in Google. Eventually, she learns of the murders from the website of a Japanese Newspaper. On the same page, she also comes across the news of death of The American Professor, Dr. Peter Kirk. She now decides to know the entire history from Dr. Kirk's widow, Maria Kirk.... The U.S versions have 2 more sequels Grudge 2 and 3. Grudge 2 is again directed by Takashi Shimizu and is also a poor sequel to his original but adds more depth to the story.Grudge 3 is directed by Toby Wilkins taking Takashi Shimizu's place. Out of all the three Grudge films, Grudge 3 is the best one and has the most horror and is also the most disturbing one I have seen.Bottom line: SEE OR BUY THE ORIGINAL. IT IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER AND MORE REALISTIC. ALSO REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A SEQUEL JU-ON 2 (2000).

90,russem31,Just as good as the Japanese original - but this isn't necessarily a great thing,7,25 December 2005,"The American remake of the Japanese Ju-on, this time know as The Grudge, is just as good as the Japanese original - but this isn't necessarily a great thing. This is because I found the original Ju-on very slow and not very scary - and this can be said about the American remake. I think the main reason for this is because Ju-On and The Grudge both has the same director, Takashi Shimizu. And with all due respect, though I never found Sarah Michelle Gellar to be a great actress, she does a good enough job in the main role as the American nurse Karen Davis living and trying to fit in a foreign country. This outing deserves a good enough 7 out of 10.If you really want to see a far superior Japanese-style psychological horror, then try The Ring.",The Grudge
91,FilmOtaku,Effectively scary,5,6 November 2004,"*Possible Spoilers*A lot of people are going to argue with me on this one, but I thought 'The Grudge' was pretty damn scary. Granted, I'm kind of a fraidy cat, but I'm generally a wuss when it comes to scary imagery and general creepiness; and 'The Grudge' was full of that. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (who also directed the original Japanese version 'Ju-On: The Grudge'), 'The Grudge' is about a bunch of Americans living in Japan who all come across a house that is cursed, thereby cursing themselves. It starts with an American couple who move in with the husband's mother. After the caregiver for the invalid mother goes missing one day, Kare, (the horribly vapid Sarah Michelle Gellar) a nursing student, takes over for the day and the fun begins.'The Grudge' is told in a non-linear style, which is somewhat confusing. It is hard to tell how much time has passed between events. Also, there are a couple of things that are either left unexplained or inconclusive (the fate of the meowing child three years ago comes to mind). However, when you take 'The Grudge' for what it was meant to be, a spooky/scary film, it is certainly effective. Combining surprise scares with creepy imagery, Shimizu not only threatens to scare the pants off of the viewer, but threatens to have you wet them first. Unfortunately there were a couple of shots that were ruined by being featured in the trailer, such as the meowing kid and the now famous 'shower scene', but there were some things that surprised the hell out of me and caused me to take issue with going to sleep that night, especially in my bed. And that is probably the best thing about the film; as Hitchcock did forty years ago with 'Psycho' (and no, I am not remotely comparing 'Psycho' or Hitchcock to 'The Grudge' or Shimizu), ordinary or 'safe' places were no longer safe in 'The Grudge'. If the house is cursed, why should anything happen outside of the house? Right? Wrong.No, 'The Grudge' is not a bastion of superb film-making or even a great horror film, but it is effective and did what it set out to do  either scared some people (like me) or made a lot of people have a hell of a lot of fun at the movies (everyone else who saw the film with me). I feel that the mission was adequately accomplished, and therefore, I give it a 5/10.Shelly",The Grudge

Not long after she arrives at the house, Karen hears noises coming from inside a bedroom closet that's been taped up, so she opens it and finds a young boy and his cat. After contacting her boss, Alex, for help, she waits at the house, but it's during this time that an unspeakable horror manifests causing the death of the woman and sending Karen to go into a state of shock. After being released from hospital, Karen learns of the murders of Kayako Saeki and her son Toshio, and, along with Detective Nakagawa, she starts to realise that the vengeful spirits of the Saeki family somehow still reside inside the home and anyone who ventures into it may well become the next victim.The Grudge, as we all know, is an American remake of the Japanese hit Ju-on, and is, in my opinion, just as good. This version sticks pretty close to the original and a lot of the scenes are the same, but a few have been added for this version that weren't in the original i.e. you see more of what happens to Kayako & Toshio, and watch out for the exceedingly creepy Yoko.The story is told in the same non-linear style, but for some reason didn't seem as confusing. Also, being a Hollywood film, you'd expect a CGI-fest for the Kayako scenes, but again, like the original, these were kept to a minimum with actress Takako Fuji doing all her own creepy contortions & movements. This may be because it was the same director who done Ju-on, who knows, but it's good that CGI never over-shadowed the story.I enjoyed the original Japanese version, but to be honest I personally thought that this remake was actually the scarier of the two. There will be die-hard Japanese horror fans that will stupidly ridicule this version just because it's an American remake, but if you've not seen it just ignore the trolls and judge it for yourself.",The Grudge
97,MichaelMargetis,"""There is something evil here"" - Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar)",2,7 August 2005,"The Grudge is a very disappointing movie. I'm not going to beat around the bush, I didn't care for a single thing this film had to offer. Well except for.... well I'm not going to spoil anything for you. The picture is so close in feel and look of ""The Ring"" that it's almost laughable, and in the end it isn't anything close to as original and terrifying as ""The Ring"" was. This is just kind of a hunk of fall crap, that scores it's screams and scares from merely cheap shots. But the cheap shots aren't what really frustrates me about ""The Grudge"", it's the fact that they never explain what is going on and more importantly why. The filmmaker spends so much time flashing weird circus crap in front of you, that he forgets to add in an actual reason why all the supernatural events are happening. There are enough unfinished and unexplained events that take place in The Grudge to fill up a 500 page novel. The acting is nothing to shout from the hilltops with glee about either. Sarah Michelle Gellar phones in her performance like she's ordering a pizza, and the actor who plays the detective investigating the horror of the Grudge is in desperate need of a career change. Maybe he should try working at McDonalds instead of acting. The only decent acting we come in counter with during the entire span of the film is from Bill Pullman, who's in the film for only the first two minutes. In conclusion, The Grudge runs for 96 minutes, but if you ask me it seems like 96 days. I've never been so anxious in my life to get out of the theater and finish up my homework at home then I was when I went to see The Grudge. Don't waste your time or money on The Grudge.

Do You Dare?,9,8 October 2012,"I've just finished watching the Hollywood adaptation of The Grudge 3, and decided to go back and write my review about this one, the first and best of the trilogy in my opinion.After I saw ""The Ring"" (another excellent adaptation of a Japanese original) I was certain that Samara was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. Then - I saw Kayoko, the evil ghost of The Grudge, and felt the same chilling terror. I've got to hand it to the Japanese film makers - they sure do know how to make bone chilling horror.It's not that The Grudge has a unique original story, or state of the art footage, or exceptionally impressive acting. It's a ghost story pretty much like any other. What it does have is one of the scariest ghosts ever seen on screen. If The Ring's Samara was simply terrifying to look at, the ghost of The Grudge also makes a terrifying sound I doubt you'd ever be able to forget. I'm a grown man of 27, and after watching this - I wished I wasn't sleeping alone that night. If that doesn't mean a horror movie has done its job, I don't know what does. If the horror loving generation before me had nightmares about the little girl from The Exorcist, I think myself and my peers will forever hold Kayoko as the scariest thing we've seen.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to really be frightened and enjoys an exceptionally well made ghost movie.

Heck, Bill Pullman throws himself off a balcony in the first two minutes. A pity that Sarah Michelle Geller has to stick around for the full 90 minutes to show off her non-acting talent. Hey, I loved her as Buffy but some actors only have one good role in them. I fear that Ms. Gellar's talents have about run their course. None of the other actors are able to garner any audience empathy either. We know is that something bad is going to happen... over and over and over... but we don't really care about the people that it's happening to. I'm sure the original Japanese movie was much better than this. I should have known better than to try watching the inferior American remake first... even if it did have the same director.

Too often do we seen horror films with weak stories and its purpose is to execute its share of pop scares. The Grudge from what I remembered is the first film in theaters that had multiple pop-up scare scenes that made the viewer tense up. Now this technique in horror films is over-used and movies don't have general creepiness like 70's, 80's, and 90's films used. Unlike many of the horror movies I'm talking about The Grudge had a solid story, even if it lacked originality. The key to this film though was Sarah Michelle Gellar, a terrific looker and actress, who always delivers a great performance. The American Grudge is clichéd, an unnecessary remake, and started those pesky over utilized pop-up scares but it holds a special place in my heart, for being a movie that got me excited about horror movies.",The Grudge
103,christian123,Some creepy moments but it doesn't make a lot of sense,5,12 March 2005,"The Grudge has some scary moments but most of the time its just to silly to take seriously. Takashi Shimizu directs an English language remake of his hit Japanese horror film Ju-On about a vengeful spirit that spreads like a virus through the victims murdered in a house. When a social worker (Sarah Michelle Gellar) accidentally lets the spirit out, it begins to haunt and kill all those who encounter it. The plot sounds scary and even with a good cast it didn't work out so well and its a mess of a movie. There's no real plot as there's just a scary scene follow by another and so on. The scary scenes are hit or miss with some actually giving you the chills while other making you laugh or fall asleep. Also most of the real scares are used in the preview so there's really nothing new. Sarah Michelle Gellar is pretty much the movies only saving grace and she does a good job though nothing special. Other cast members worth mentioning are Bill Pullman and this is his first feature film that I have seen him in awhile. Clea DuVall is in the film for about twenty minutes so she's not very memorable. KaDee Strickland and Jason Behr are also in the film but aren't worth mentioning. Director Takashi Shimizu does a decent job, but hopefully the sequel will make more sense and they will spend more time on writing it. Japan itself looks beautiful in the film and I'm glad that they kept the story in Japan. After watching this movie I don't know if its worth checking out the original though since the IMDb rating on this site for it isn't very impressive. Rating 5/10, now that its out on video its worth a look just don't expect too much from it.",The Grudge

The story is about a girl called Karen Davis who is an American nurse who moves to Tokyo she arrives at a house in Tokyo. The house is possessed by a violent evil that destroys the lives of everyone who enters. she comes into contact with a supernatural spirit who is vengeful and often possesses its victims. several horrifying and mysterious deaths start to occur, with the spirit passing its curse onto each victim. this curse causes its victims to die in the grip of a powerful rage. After the nurse Yoko fails to show up for work, Karen is asked to check on Emma an American lady, who recently moved to Japan with her son, daughter and daughter in-law Jennifer. Whilst inside the house, Karen is alarmed by Emma's unusual behaviour, She is mute and sleeps through the day. When she enters her home, she finds an elderly American woman, Emma, who is lost in a catatonic state while the rest of the house appears deserted and. As she is seeing to the old woman, Karen hears scratching sounds from upstairs. When she investigates, she is faced with a supernatural horror more frightening than she could ever imagine.

105,jmbwithcats,A remake over redone,4,24 October 2004,"Now I have seen the original and feel the first 45 minutes of the original are up there with some of the best directing of any horror movie ever made. The tension building is ingenious, leaving little details to be figured out by the viewer, but sadly the movie falls into satirical mediocrity soon after. I still rated the movie a 7 overall.The remake I went into knowing they would really speed things along and anything I loved from the original would be different and that's okay, it's to be expected, but this movie simply failed at building tension, and failed at being even remotely scary.It's like they spent all their energy trying rather then doing that it completely misses the mark.For remakes of Japanese movies, The Ring was exceptional but it had all the right people directing, doing effects, casted, etc.. it all just worked, and I am in love with the entire original Japanese series of Ring,particularly Yukie Nakama in Ring 0.Anyways, this was a rather mediocre film, definitely a failed remake. I dread them remaking A Tale of Two Sisters, the original is a masterpiece.All the CGI in this movie made it feel unreal, and more like Casper the ghost then an intensely powerful grudge stalking a house.From this movie I get this impression they tried TOO hard to Americanize it and in doing so sort of disrespected the culture involved. I wish more people would watch original Asian cinema, The Ring series, Uzumaki, A Tale of Two Sisters, Some movies simply should not be remade, because you're changing elements, elements that changed can really throw off all the chemistry to a story, turning it into a mockery of the original folklore.I am not saying I'm against cross culturization, but come on, if you want to bring the cultures together, make a NEW story about an American in Japan not constantly doing remakes.Sometimes remakes are good because they introduce us to the original films we may never have seen otherwise, but it's all in the way it's formulated. And the Grudge originally was a bit silly, but the remake lacked any of the original's tension and only held to the silliness. Every time the Grudge builds it falls flat and leaves me disappointed.In the original, we see near the beginning the woman cleaning the house then she takes a nap. A eerie gust of wind comes along and blows her things over in complete disarray, silently we understand why the house is so messy and why they don't even bother cleaning, it's because the Grudge destroys any semblance of organization once established. Sadly this movie doesn't confront such fascinating details in as intelligently a fashion.Things jump out at you but in the theaters no one screamed, they laughed,because the timing was wrong, just wasn't scary.The Grudge simply doesn't deliver. I say save your money, watch the original Ring series, watch A Tale of Two Sisters, watch Battle Royale, watch Inner Senses, watch The Eye... avoid The Grudge.",The Grudge
106,ThrownMuse,lost in translation,5,8 December 2004,"Karen is an American nursing student in Japan. When a catatonic woman's home caretaker goes missing, Karen fills in for her to get some school credits. She arrives and learns what the audience already knows: there is something evil lurking in the house.The American version of the Japanese ""Ju On"" is an entertaining and quite scary haunted house horror flick, but overall I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied.Comparisons to the American film The Ring seem inevitable before stepping foot in the theatre, as The Grudge is the first (in what could be a long line of) American-remade J-horror films since the huge success of The Ring. However, upon viewing The Grudge, such comparisons are fair and perhaps telling.The movie is scary, but mostly because it relies upon quick and consistent scare tactics (many shamelessly lifted from Ringu and The Ring) rather than by creating an unsettling atmosphere--which made the others movies so successful as horror films. That isn't to say that the scares in The Grudge aren't effective. The images are indeed creepy and caused me to scream-and-jump almost every time. However, there is hardly a build-up or engaging mystery to the back-story of ""the grudge"", and when it is revealed to Karen and the audience, it is really difficult to connect it with the terror we are witnessing.The movie doesn't offer much in terms of characterization, which is an important element in ghost stories. The audience isn't given much of an opportunity to sympathies with our leads. What we have is a handful of Americans living in Japan and being terrorized by two (croaking and meowing) Japanese grudge-holding ghosts. And their hair. From Kwaidan to Ringu, it seems that the female ghost with long black hair has long been a theme of Japanese horror movies. I am assuming that this is a cultural thing that I do not understand, as I am very unfamiliar with Japanese culture. In the American The Ring, most traces of Japanese culture are removed and the movie has no Japanese characters or mythology. Samara and her dark black hair covering her face are horrifying across the board, due to great effects and even better atmospheric build up. The Grudge goes right for the money shot: Look! She's being haunted by BLACK HAIR! The basic plot of The Grudge is apparently rooted in cultural mythology, but it is not expanded on in the film. It is briefly mentioned by the Japanese detective, who I found to be the most interesting character in the movie. The Japanese director (Takashi Shimizu, who helmed the Ju-On series), has said something to the effect of needing to change many elements of the original that would not appeal to American audiences--most obviously, by switching to an American cast. While it is obvious that changing the lead cast is for language and financial reasons, I still find it curious that it consists of three separate groups of people (Karen and Doug, the Williams family, Peter & Maria), all of which are American. Some are getting along fine with their jobs, studies and the culture, others are experiencing ""lost in translation"" isolation.The Grudge has a fair share of scares, and it will have you jumping out of your seat. But by the end of this movie, one can't help but wonder about the underlying narrative about Americans and Japan, especially with regards to the current trend of Hollywood dishing out the dough to remake J-horror films.My rating: 5/10",The Grudge
107,I_Am_The_Taylrus,It Was Just Not That Good (SPOILERS),4,2 March 2007,"SPOILERS I always love a good and terrifying horror film. I am not a big fan of Japanese horror films, but I was interested in watching this. It is based on a Japanese horror, I know, but it had a solid cast and looked like a really scary horror film. Well, it was not a good movie. Sure, it had some solid scares but it was way too boring. I mean, there was barely any dialog. I did not find this entertaining. It was also just too weird, in my opinion. I also do not think it is a very good idea to make a remake of a Japanese horror film. You will see what I mean when you watch this.Here is the plot of this movie. A nurse named Karen, hey, isn't there a nurse named Karen in Halloween 2? Anyway, a nurse named Karen has to take care of a woman that lives in a house in Tokyo, Japan. When she goes there she finds out that the woman named Emma is basically unresponsive to anyone. She also realizes that there is a creepy little boy with a psychotic moaning noise in the house. Emma dies. Then Karen's boyfriend comes to the house. The ghost kills her boyfriend. Karen sets the house on fire. She escapes alive, but at the hospital her boyfriend's body is making a moaning noise.Overall, this is a boring thriller. There is a lot more characters in the movie but I just was not paying a lot of attention because it was so boring. The moaning noise that little boy makes is scary at times but it gets really annoying really fast. The sequel for this movie was pointless. I mean, was there really need for a sequel? What is even worse is that they are making another sequel. Enough about the sequels, though. This is a pointless and sometimes scary film but it does not succeed as much as it's Japanese counterpart.4/10Recommended Films: The Grudge 2.",The Grudge
108,Thrashman88,"Same Girl from ""The Ring""???",6,12 June 2005,"The americanized version of this Japanese story is entertaining, scary enough and interesting, but that's about it. The thing that annoyed me the most about ""The Grudge"" was the lack of background; after you're finished with this movie you're left wondering a whole Lot of ""whys"" about it. Have this background info been more ""hearty"" it would have made me feel more pleased about this movie. For starters, I'd say a title like ""Grudge"" doesn't really apply here; sure, a ""ghost"" of sorts is p****d off, but usually there's some explanation as to WHY is this ""ghost"" p****d off. Shades of other superior films like ""THE CHANGELING"" and yes, even the Americanized version of ""THE RING"" come to mind right away. The acting is good and the overall mood of the film is actually chilling (my grading goes primarily because of these technical achievements!), but the rendering of this story for American (or should it be, ""western"" audiences) is a bit contrived and leaves a lot to be desired. THE GRUDGE is surely scary and it IS an enjoyable movie. It's just that some story elements are not fully explained and it makes you feel like you're watching an ""alternate"" version of THE RING!",The Grudge
109,shanfloyd,Why should there be a remake?,6,29 December 2004,"It's hard to understand why 'Ju-On' should be remade... especially when you are appointing the same director. ""The Grudge"", if considered as a single unrelated venture, not awful. There are some scare moments, if one calls them scary. The story is straightforward, though not clear enough grasp or interesting enough to impress. I haven't seen the original. But I assume if a director is given chance to make basically one film twice, the second one should be better. In that case I'm not going to look for the original one in DVD parlors.The cast are not bad. Sarah Gellar is fine, and that guy who played the Japanese detective is also impressing. I liked the director's idea of showing enough flashbacks in the middle whenever necessary. But Pullman's action in the beginning or how Gellar saw the actual thing in that time-travel kind of way remained unexplained. But one gotta respect the fact that these horror films always remain unexplained, perhaps.One more thing I couldn't understand. I don't know if it's a co-incidence or not. I saw two Japanese horror remakes -- 'The Ring' being the other. The basic facts are more or less the same. And some features of showing horror too. I suspect there are more Japanese horror Hollywood remakes on the way, and this is not a good sign. Why is there such lack of subject matter?",The Grudge

On the other hand, it really lacks any sort of meaningful story. It's almost like a short film that got bloated to full length.The aesthetics of the film were pretty good, although the editing was just too jagged to keep me interested in all the stories. It's almost like Takashi Shimizu (the director) decided to be like Quentin Tarentino, except with a case of ADD. It sort of disperses the suspense (and I think it also is a clever way of hiding the lack of story and also getting a chance to put in more suspenseful ""yarr ghosties!"" scenes).If you're the type that scares and want to be scared, this is a good place to go for that.

I like Sarah Michelle Gellar in this movie, but the film hits the same beat over and over again. Someone is introduced, they go into the haunted house, and something bad happens to them. It is scary the first couple of time, but then it gets tiresome. The last half hour of the movie is particularly a letdown as the climax falls flat. Trying to tell the story out of chronological order (a process I generally do not like) just makes the movie more convoluted. This movie has delusions of grandeur in my opinion when the plot is basically an 80s slasher flick with less blood and gore. Slightly better than The Ring (which I found completely incoherent) but I think we can put a stop to importing Japanese horror films.",The Grudge
112,Jacques98,Not as good as Japanese version of Dark Water or the American version of The Ring.,2,9 September 2008,"At least The Grudge tried to be scary, and it succeeded to an extent. It was cheesy and it did use the tiresome little-kid-ghosts-who-kill cliché, but there was still something about it that beat out a lot of wannabe horror movies I've seen. Maybe the Asians do understand ghost stories better than the Americansas can be argued using (the original) Dark Water and The Ring. Maybe the movie was a little more entertaining and scary than I've seen in a while. I don't know.All I know is The Grudge does everything wrong except the core ghost story, which redeems it. I wouldn't call it original or different, but it is unnerving. Also, the content for a PG-13 movie is no different than a lot of R-rated ghost movies like The Orphanage, which this far surpasses.Maybe in the end I liked The Grudge more than I realize.

114,Quebec_Dragon,Yet another unread paradoxical review,8,22 May 2012,"It's funny because I saw this film before years ago, but I don't think I cared much for it, nor did I remember most of it. I watched it a few days ago and I liked it a lot more. Was it because I watched the director's cut? It's quite possible. Here we have a Japanese haunted house tale except that the few ghosts (or spirits) are quite belligerent and will haunt (and hunt) you even outside the house. Originally a Japanese film, it was remade for American audiences with some American actors and a bigger budget. It does still take place in Japan, has the same director as the original and several of the same actors. Those are anomalies in themselves, perhaps explaining why it's so different than your usual American horror film. There's not much gore to speak of, and the movie often cuts just before the ""kill"", but the film is probably better because of it, because it leaves more to your imagination. There's a general feeling of uneasiness and creepiness permeating this film.It relies a lot on smart sound effect work, seeing scenes from different viewpoints and setting up the scares slowly. It can be just a face, but the surprising way it appears is often freaky. Some of the most memorable, most unnerving scenes for me involved a simple bus ride and watching a black and white video footage. Praise should be given to most of the actors who looked genuinely scared (especially Sarah Michelle Gellar) without even screaming. In fact, for them, and perhaps the viewers, it's so horrifying, they can't even scream. There's also an interesting mystery going on about who the spirits are, giving them background and personalization. I prefer that to faceless anonymous spirits. The structure is non-linear but not too tough to understand and will make subsequent watchings more enjoyable. I think the only real not-so-negative criticisms I could give it would be that the flashback sequences were sometimes awkwardly handled and too convenient (as in, why now?). The little boy can also become silly instead of creepy depending on your mood. I think that as far as Japanese horror remakes go, I preferred the Ring, but the Grudge is also quite worthy. The best praise I could give this film is that I keep thinking about it and of what might be lurking in unexpected places, especially at night in the dark.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (Very good) P.S. The commentary is well worth watching in part because of the good spirits of the Japanese creators doing it (it's subtitled in English, but you hear their Japanese voices and laughs).",The Grudge
115,SamJamie,Chilling & genuinely scary.,8,14 December 2020,"The Grudge is led by the star of Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, in a surprising twist on the standard-issue haunted house movie. The plot follows Gellar as Karen Davis, an American carer employed to take over the care of Emma, a dementia sufferer. At the house, Karen discovers strange and supernatural occurrences. The house, as it turns out, is the site of a curse that lingers in a specific place and claims the lives of anyone that comes near.The film genuinely surprises as one is never quite sure where it is headed next, all the while involving the viewer in a freakish, unforgettably nightmarish ride... with some of the most unnerving imagery and soundscapes I've seen on screen. The film is an Americanized version of a Japanese film, similar to ""The Ring."" Whilst not being as original, it has plenty of jumps and genuine creepiness. The precision of slow revelation is the focus, and Shimizu makes good use of it to cloak a simple plot and vague characters in enduring suspense. Fans accustomed to noisier, more graphic jolts may be impatient with The Grudge's measured insidiousness. Others may find it refreshing, curiously so. The bottom line is, The Grudge would have been ruined in the hands of a typical Hollywood American director.",The Grudge
116,Cedric_Catsuits,Very Disappointing,4,11 May 2006,"SMG doesn't seem to have much luck with movies - apart from Cruel Intentions I can't recall a single memorable performance, and sadly she continues the tradition here. OK, it's a thousand times better than the abysmal Scooby films, and in places almost on a par with her portrayal of Buffy. She has real talent and I don't entirely blame her for this lack of success - it must be down to her choice of projects. Why on earth she signed up for a sequel to this is baffling - she doesn't need the money. Maybe she needs to hire new people, and get some decent advice.Perhaps the story and direction lost something in translation, and perhaps the Japanese have different expectations. The Grudge displays a definite class in some areas, but is let down by a disjointed and confusing construction. There are 3 or 4 genuinely scary moments - but they are just moments, and the overall effect is further diluted by some really dreadful, laughable attempts at horror. In places beautifully framed and lit, it is just not dark enough to be create a scary atmosphere. The effects are appalling, and the whole 'hair & eye' thing is really, sickeningly naff.At times I wondered if the cast actually knew where the scares were meant to be coming from, and when there were some real frights the reactions were confusingly mild. This movie starts well but after about 2 minutes you've seen the best - from there it's all downhill. There are glimpses of something much better close to the surface, and with a bit of tinkering this could be good. But as it stands it is unacceptably poor, and I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it ever again. Sarah I do love you but, come on - get your act together!",The Grudge

Director Takashi Schimizu does a good job of giving the audiences some creepy moments but the lack of real scares, suspense, and character development besides Gellar's character is what weighed it down the most. The cast however are good in their roles but not memorable including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, Clea DuVuall, and Bill Pullman but most of them are developed enough because they're not in it much. The rest of the cast okay in their limited screen time. This movie did start off weird and there were some creepy moments but the bad outweighs the good in this one. There was a little suspense but there should have been more and there weren't any real scares because this film didn't frighten me at all. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and some characters made stupid decisions but then again what do I except this is a horror movie after all so just go with it. Overall The Grudge was disappointing because I hoped it would be a good but it ended up being a major letdown.

Rating: 12.5/5 [5/10]Soooo, I'm pretty big on the Ju-On series and really enjoyed all 8 films that the original version has to offer. I didn't ever think too much about the American remakes and decided to go ahead and completely ignore them for my life. Then I realised I had seen this first 2004 film, had absolutely no memory of this, and my ""must complete all collections I start"" issues kicked in.So here I am, binging a series I really hated for most of my life and originally gave a 3/10 [1.5/5]. After re-watching this, I noticed a lot of little nuances.Americans panicking and speaking in English before they realised they had to speak Japanese - this is a big thing that actually happens for most people; when scared or hurt, they'll default to their native language.
The horror aspect was bad, but it wasn't too bad. There were some moments that did make me jump and caught me by surprise.It wasn't too bad at all, actually.

119,anhedonia,Lost in translation,4,30 October 2004,"I'm always wary of remakes.More often than not, they're never as good as the original. I'm even more skeptical of foreign filmmakers who agree to remake their movies for an American studio. It sounds like a good idea to keep the original director, but just as Hong Kong filmmakers John Woo, Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark were forced to water down their action film-making when they came to Hollywood, foreign directors seem to lose their artistic integrity when remaking their films for Hollywood. Remember what happened when George Sluizer remade his 1988 film, ""The Vanishing,"" for American audiences five years later? He turned a brilliant psychological thriller into a pedestrian Hollywood film and tacked on a happy ending, to boot.Nevertheless, I was eager to see what Japanese director Takashi Shimuzu would do with his remake of ""The Grudge."" There are two things initially going for this film. One, despite starring American actors, the story remains in Japan, thereby creating potential to tap into differences in horror mythology. Two, ""The Grudge"" remake opens with a doozy of a scene involving Bill Pullman.Alas, after that, there's really nothing much more to this film. Part of the problem could be that while Shimuzu's original was rated R, the remake is PG-13. Japanese horror films depend much more on creating an eerie atmosphere than loading up the gore. It's a great device, since they often prey on our fear of the unknown.But this film does not tap into the cultural differences between America and Japan and does not delve into the psychological traps that each culture's folklore creates. True, there are some genuine shocks in this American remake. But none of the characters is very interesting and, despite its origins, ""The Grudge"" turns into just a typical Hollywood horror with characters doing dumb things like sticking their heads into dark crevices to find out if there's anything in there. You want to hazard a guess as to what happens? There's also a character who winds up in an office stairwell, hears strange noises and promptly yells, ""Is anyone there?"" In the history of horror films, has there ever been a reply to that question?The biggest disappointment with ""The Grudge"" is that Shimuzu and screenwriter Stephen Susco reveal the story's terrifying monster early. Once we've seen it, there's no more reason to fear it. So while the characters all seem scared of it, for us, the terror's more laughable than scary.The nonlinear structure isn't distracting, but it seems more gimmicky than anything else. And the horror scenes appear to work outside the story - you could easily shift the frightening scenes around in any order and it wouldn't make any difference to the plot or film. The movie's most terrifying moment belongs not to Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen, but to KaDee Strickland's Susan Williams as she's tracked from her high-rise office to her apartment.""The Grudge"" spends so much time pretending to be scary that it loses much of its edge. The monsters aren't all that frightening once we see them and, after a while, I just wanted Gellar to turn into Buffy Summers. She wouldn't have put up with all this nonsense. She'd have just kicked the crap out of them. And that would have made the film a lot more entertaining and enjoyable.",The Grudge

121,basrutten,Hollow,4,4 January 2005,"The latest trend in Hollywood seems to be remaking Japanese horror movies. I haven't seen the original ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", so I can't comment whether the American ""The Grudge"" movie does justice to the original. I'm sure however that it doesn't do justice to anything else.Bluntly put, this is not a very good movie. Just about every aspect of it feels fairly uninspired, boring, and uninteresting. Horror movies don't necessarily need a strong plot or characters, but this movies sets an all time low for both categories. It's basically about a number of rather dull characters that enter a haunted house and die one by one. Neither the reason behind all the deaths nor the ways in which they occur are very interesting: the plot is very obvious and devoid of any really interesting revelations of twists, and moves at a very slow pace to boot.This might still be OK if the movie at least manages to be scary. In my opinion, it doesn't, although I can imagine that many other will find it scary (it's a matter of taste). There are lots of ""surprise scares"" but most of the times, they're predictable (a single character enters a dark attic...yeez, I wonder what's going to happen now), and while ""The Grudge"" certainly manages to create a dark atmosphere, there's no real feeling of suspense since you likely won't care much about which character lives and which character dies, and since it's painfully clear that they're going to die anyway.Truth be told, the movie does some things right. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a good job, and the rest of the cast is OK as well. The camera work is also very good. Buth no amount of good acting and technical expertise can make up for what is essentially a nearly plot less and rather pointless movie that relies solely on a number of supposedly scary moments.** out of ***** (add one * if you scare easily)",The Grudge

It IS scary in the extreme - oppression and death curses every scene in this absolute pant-wetter of a movie. But in favour of letting the audience wet themselves, they have just thrown away any cares about plot, real interest or character - and that is why The Ring was far better. The ending made little sense, serving just one purpose - to make a film that was 100% horror and 0% plot. None of it comes together, and from what people have said, I don't think the sequel will explain a great deal more. It's not a great movie, but there are enough genuine scares and interesting elements of Japanese culture to warrant a purpose. Lots of effort went into making this film as the special features on the DVD point out - the actors and director had to communicate even though the cast were all Americans and the director was Japanese - which made for a lot of complications and everything had to be translated. Which may explain why the acting wasn't hot. But the scares certainly were, and though this film won't make you shiver in bed all night long like The Ring (which was helped by the fact it was plain WEIRD), it will at least make you jump out of your skin every five minutes.

Columbia Pictures and Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures set out to make an American version of ""Ju-on"" or ""The Grudge"". They got the director of the original film Takashi Shimizu to do the re-make and all things look great on paper for and epic film. Unlike ""The Ring"" which relocated its story to Seattle, ""The Grudge"" takes place in Tokyo. When ""Americanizing"" a foreign film something is always lost in the translation. The cultural gaps and customs are just too big to overcome. ""The Grudge"" does alright in this respect but is still comes up a little short. First let me say that the movie really is scary and has a great atmosphere to it. The fact that it takes place in Tokyo is a big plus and adds to the whole experience.The myth goes: When some dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse a born and consumes everybody who come in contact with it. This is explained in a prologue. Sarah Michelle Geller plays Karen and exchange student who lives with her American med school boyfriend Doug, played by Jason Behr. Both lead roles are miscast with Behr's part being completely useless. Gellar is no stranger to horror and she does a serviceable job, but they could've found someone better. In a bit of good casting famed Japanese actor Ryo Ishibashi plays Detective Nakagawa who investigates the cursed house. Ishibashi, played the male lead in the horror classic ""Audition"".The story is structured in a way that shows how each character has encountered the house. Starting the family who bought it for there invalid mother Emma. We see what happens to her kids, then her care takers Yoko, then Karen. They all encounter the vengeful ghosts of Kayako and Toshio. The curse is an unstoppable force of pure rage that seems to literally scare people to death. Karen researches the house and the curse and we find out the history of the family that use the live there. She and the Detective aim to somehow stop the curse, but Kayako and Toshio are some pretty bad ass ghosts that are not nearly ready to give it up. The ending gives some decent scares but is pretty uninspired and ambiguous. The movie spawned a few sequels that didn't even stand up to the low standards set by the original.",The Grudge
125,Mivas_Greece,The beginning of a franchise that inspired many movies. Created its own kind of horror movies. Recommended.,7,16 May 2021,"Metaphysical horror movie. Grudge was the beginning of a great franchise, from which many more films were inspired. Like franschise Rings, Grudge relies on Japanese films (Ju-on, 2000) and with its unique concept and style, they are a distinct kind of horror films in themselves. So according to tradition, if a violent death occurs, then the wrath of the victim will fall on the scene as a curse that will haunt everything in that area. The film is quite well-written, with very good effects, intensity and suspense from start to finish and does not get boring at all. The script, the directing, but also the actors were all excellent and are definitely among the most classic films in the genre, but also a reference film. Definitely in the top recommended horror movies.",The Grudge
126,lotus_chief,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen...,4,23 November 2004,"**SPOILERS BELOW**What's really sad is that Sam Raimi and Co. were REALLY trying to make a horror film, to scare us. I was anything BUT scared at this clichéd 'horror' film. You'd think that by now people would know the formula to a horror film: when the music intensifies something's about to happen. Some idiot is busy snooping around where they're not supposed to and ends up in a dark, secluded area...guess what?? Something's about to happen. You think seeing scenarios like these time and time again will instantly let on that someone's about to die, but no, I had to be in a theater with a bunch of silly teens who scream at every little thing. This movie could've easily went by another name: 'Follow The Trail'. What was the deal with having garbage on the floor and everyone just following the paper trail to their death? Yoko dying was one of the funniest moments in movie history, along with Bill Pullman falling from his balcony without hesitation LMAO. 'Honey, you're up early'...he slides off the railing head first to the ground LMAO! Too too funny. The only semi-smart person in this film was the cop, when he finally went to the house with 2 cartons of gasoline ready to burn the cursed house down. Too bad he was stupid to fall for the curse's trick. I don't know why he, or anyone else, didn't do that 3 years ago when the case first opened. And what was with the boyfriend? He saw what Gellar was researching, about people getting killed in that house and whatnot, but a light-bulb goes off in his head which tells him to go there by himself, hands swinging with NO weapon/protection of any kind to 'look for her'. Are you serious? Another favorite of mine is the sister who was haunted by the curse at her job LMAO! That was surprising; as I thought the curse was confined to the house only. She had her cowering like a little girl in her covers LMAO! Very funny stuff. What was even funnier, and led the movie more and more into utter comedy was the 'cry' of the curse. They couldn't come up with a better sound for it? That's some kid stuff that we used to do back in the day, trying to see who could do it the longest. How ridiculous!If you wanna have a good laugh, this is the movie for you.

Like ""The Ring"" before it, ""The Grudge"" is an Americanized version of a highly successful Japanese Horror flick. (Has Hollywood no original horror script-writers left?) Anyway, ""The Grudge"" is okay. Not great, but certainly not terrible. The characterisation is weak, with little or no explanation as to the whys and wherefores of the plot. A house ""replays"" events?? Please. Tell us something we don't know. Where the film scores is the score, (see what I did there?) the soundtrack is integral to the plot, in fact it could be called a secondary character. The acting is above average with TV's Buffy and ""Roswell's"" Jason Behr putting in good performances. (with what little material they have to work with) The Japanese contingent are universally good and Bill Pullmann is surprisingly heavy in a smallish role.

I do prefer Ju-on over this one mainly because it was more well done. There is not much else to say besides it being scary. I recommend Ju-on over this one though.

Sarah Michelle Gellar of Buffy fame plays Karen, an American woman who lives in a house in Tokyo that is possessed by evil demons who sound like they have had too much soda, they open their mouths wide and belching sounds come out. They are meant to be scary sounds, but I found them annoying. I was never really scared, the formula for movies like this is pretty well known, a character seen walking down a dark hallway is doomed, and often is. There are flashbacks, well at least I think they are flashbacks, detailing the previous inhabitants of the house and why the ghosts are so upset and why they continue to pick on unsuspecting Americans. Based on the Japanese movie, The Grudge is the usual American-slasher film that offers very little in groundbreaking material.",The Grudge
130,MF210,Has its creepy moments but not very satisfying in the end,6,3 February 2005,"My Review: ** out of ****.When I first saw previews for The Grudge, I thought it was going to be a Ring wannabe or at least along the lines of the Ring. I guess that is a reasonable thought since both were inspired by Japanese films and now being remade for the American audience. Unfortunately, when you compare the two films, The Ring clearly comes out on top.Thats not to say there is not anything good about The Grudge but I have a feeling this was just put together to score off The Ring's success. The Grudge offers some creepy moments but nothing else beyond them. You can say what you want about how open-ended The Ring was and how much the plot did not make sense, but it had a much more solid plot than what is found in The Grudge. By the end of The Ring, I was intrigued by what was left unanswered but at the end of The Grudge, I was just confused.Part of the reason, I was confused was because I just did not care what happened. The writer seemed to have no intention of creating characters for us to identify with. We have no sort of connection with them, they just seem to be here because you need people to kill off in a horror film.The other reason is because of the quality of the acting. Sarah Michelle Gellar is as uninspired as an actress can get. Throughout the film she just seems to be going through the motions. The rest of the cast, which is made up of American and Asian actors, fails to make an impression.Nevertheless, The Grudge does have some good points. The director of the film, Takashi Shimizu, was the director of the original and there is no doubt he gives the film a very stylish look. The eerie atmosphere fills every frame and there are quite a few moments where I jumped out of my seat. Nevertheless, some of those moments reminded me too closely of The Ring. There is one moment where a detective is watching the spirit on a surveillance tape and is walking towards the television. No doubt its creepy but I almost expected it to walk out of the TV. Also, even at those moments, it fails to measure up to The Ring's most memorable moments.The Grudge is only worth a watch if you want a few good scare. At its very best, it is competent as a horror film. However, like I said before The Grudge seems to have only one purpose for being made. If the filmmakers had spent more time with story and characters, then The Grudge could have been a good horror film but as it stands, its just not worth your time.",The Grudge
131,FKDZ,"Good at building suspense, but becomes repetitive.",5,20 October 2021,"Overall I though this was a good start to a movie, the suspense build up was done really well and the first visual of the monster was good. But sadly it only went downhill after that.The story and pacing is a bit meh, it's mostly doing its thing like any other horror and introduces its characters very briefly, builds suspense with random sounds a character has to investigate, and kills. And that goes on repeat for quite a while. The formula gets noticeably annoying in this movie though. And with the lack of creativity in kills or gore, it doesn't pay off either.I thought most of all that the monster(s) here were underwhelming. Except for the final scene in the house, that's when I thought it finally did what I expected it to do from the start, be scary and creepy. Though the stop motion effect was a bit funny. Most of the scares are just a person with pale skin and black hair. And the whole ghostly effects were not that great and ruined a bit of the mystery for me. Why was it even there in the first place? It's not really used for anything.The acting is fine. Directing is good, really well done and did a lot for the actual suspense build up. The music is alright.There's not a lot of gore or blood for the matter, pretty much zero violence. So if you don't like any of that but do like something a little scary, this would do well. Or if you are scared easily by pale black-haired Japanese actors.All in all it was fine. But tends to feel slow and repetitive.",The Grudge

The one exception is The Ring.

""Oh, let's go check out that really creepy sound all by myself after I found my wife/mother/girlfriend/pet dead/catatonic/(insert-state-of-being-here).""

134,The_Orenda,The potential is wasted.,2,16 January 2005,"During The Grudge, you hoped that maybe the movie would mix Lost in Translation with The Ring and a couple of fresh scares. Instead, the movie sucked on all fours. The fresh scares you would expect from a modern horror movie were replaced with the same generic garbage we've been force-fed since our youth. Which is sad really, because the idea of The Grudge originally had the potential to be a very good movie. Seriously, please give this movie fifteen minutes and you can see how they blew it. When Bill Pullman opens the movie, you wish later on that you joined him.Strange things are amuck in a house in Japan that forgives neither American nor Japanese.Was there some point where you had no clue what was going on? Minutes are spent looking at scenery and rooms. There's a dim hue that becomes annoying. And sadly, there are the obligatory references to a more famous film based on yet another Japanese film, The Ring with: ghastly women, photos that intrigue and, eyes, oh no, eyes!

135,oshram-3,Middle of the road thriller,4,23 October 2004,"Yes, I know this is a remake of the Japanese horror film Ju-On, and no, I haven't seen the original. I don't particularly care for horror as a genre, either written or filmed; it doesn't really grab me or speak to me, and most American horror films are just so much trash, an excuse for bloodletting and gore (the only recent exception I can think of, which was still pretty gory, was last year's Wrong Turn, which starred another Buffy alumnus).Honestly, I went to see The Grudge on the basis of two actors, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr, both of whom I've seen in other projects, and both of whom I like. That this particular film was remade by the original director led me to believe it would have some integrity, unlike a lot of other films that are remade and dumbed down for the American audience (yes, I'm thinking of Point of No Return, among others).The Grudge is a more cerebral thriller; there's murder afoot, but we're not subjected to ghoulishly outlandish killings ala the Final Destination series. The Grudge's thrills come mostly from the two creepy ghosts and their stalking; one is a young boy (Yuya Ozeki) who howls like a demented cat, and the other is a ghastly young woman (Takako Fuji) who really makes your skin crawl. These two pop up almost anywhere, and for a long while it's uncertain if they are actually appearing or are merely in the mind of their beholders. Writer/director Takashi Shimuzu uses his frightening malefactors to excellent effect.It's too bad the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to its potential. While I enjoyed the non-sequential storytelling and found it easy to follow and seamlessly done, The Grudge moves along a little slow for my tastes. There are an awful lot of gaijin in the movie as well, and it's never explained why so many westerners are involved with this particular curse (only the ghosts and the police are Japanese; everyone else is American); aside from a few brief words, nothing is made of the cultural barriers. Also, I found the root cause of the mystery to be predictable, given away a third of the movie before it's revealed. In a slower, more thoughtful type of thriller like this, preserving that mystery is key, and revealing it as early as Shimuzu (I'm thinking unintentionally) does robs the later revelation  probably the best sequence in the film  of a lot of its power (Shimuzu is not alone in this misstep. M. Night Shamalamadingdong RUINED the Sixth Sense by blowing the 'big' mystery twenty minutes in).The actors all do fine here. Bill Pullman, whom I've disliked since ID4, is actually low key and very effective as the first victim of the curse. I was disappointed Behr's role was so small (he's barely more than a cameo). Gellar is very good, conveying the horror of the situation and her bewilderment with what's going on very effectively. Her rooftop scene with the police inspector is understated and strong. Given her talent I didn't feel The Grudge to be a particular stretch for her, but she's very good here. And I'm always glad to see Ted Raimi have a cameo in anything.Overall The Grudge isn't a bad film, it's just not a very good one. It's a sort of middle of the road horror film with some interestingly creepy visuals and some decent performances, but there's nothing spectacular or compelling enough about this story or the way it is told to merit this remake. I much prefer this type of thriller to the hack and slash variety of most American horror films, but saying this is better than Jeepers Creepers is like saying having the flu is better than having leprosy. I could only recommend The Grudge for horror fans, or fans of Japanese movie-making, or people like me, who simply miss Gellar after seven years on TV and don't want to subject themselves to something including a computer animated dog. Or Matthew Lillard, same difference.",The Grudge
136,jrfranklin01,Seems Like a Ring to Me,6,2 November 2004,"First please allow me to preface this whole commentary with a bit of information: The Grudge = the Japanese ""Ju-on"" = The Ring = the Japanese ""Ringu"". Now what that equation excellently illustrates is how some good Japanese horror can always be remade to make millions on the American market. Not that I'm complaining though. I thought ""The Ring"" was one of the best horrors in the last few years. But unfortunately for ""The Grudge"", it couldn't leave well enough alone and decided instead to ""borrow"" elements from ""The Ring"" and introduce it as its own. Specifically, the film has the whole Samara-from-the- Ring-bit down to a fine science, complete with the hair over the face, super-white flesh, and that strange jerky fast-forward walk (scares the hell out of me!). It then uses some good gore, a scary cat, and your classic demonic child for accompaniment. So you see, The Grudge is far from original. Even the story, about a possessed home where its owners died a horrible death isn't original. Despite this, ""The Grudge"" does manage to deliver some pretty powerful scares. Classic mounting suspense is delivered well and creepiness overall is excellent. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) does good on the big screen as a victim of the supernatural. She still seems just a little too cupcake to me though. You know what I mean? I couldn't rate this movie poorly despite its robberies simply because it does have some good jump-out-of-your-seat material. I wouldn't want to watch this film alone. 6/10",The Grudge
137,noizyme,Belching ghost and mutant cat-child run amuck,5,8 February 2005,"I gave this movie a 5/10 because I didn't need to see another horror movie like the Exorcist, but it's interesting to see what the horror genre has become. This borrows a lot of quick-shots from the Ring, and it takes a lot of scenes from the Ring and includes them here, but with less interesting things added (like the video scene where the spirit comes out of no where and attacks the video camera).Basically, Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a caretaker for sick older people and is assigned to substitute for a caretaker than has been missing. The other caretaker, ""Yoko,"" has been missing because an evil spirit has taken over her body. Why? Apparently because the spirit moves on when it becomes bored and wants to give a good scare...that's what my understanding is. So everything culminates around what body the spirit will inhabit next, and Gellar's is on the list because now she knows too much (after sneaking around the house and finding a cat-boy...yes, a cat-boy...hiding in the closet of her client.) The movie was haunting, and seeing Bill Pullman as the love-interest of the spirit was an interesting choice. I can see why the American-made version was created because it shows you the ending first, and then tries to invite you to understand why things are the way they are in the movie. I sort of think that this was actually Ju-on's director's second chance at making the movie perfect. I see that Sam Raimi had his hand in this, but I wonder if that was the intention by the original director to fix certain things about Ju-on that were not as pleasing to American audiences.Alas, this film gets a 5/10 from me because it is average and stays there because there's nothing truly original about the film. I would've scored it a 6 (for it's modern day spooks and newer direction on how the ""villains"" act and move, to give it a creepier feel), but again, the Ring beat them to the punch on this one. All of that new-style direction was made popular by the Ring, and the Grudge feels like it borrowed a lot from that film and tried to make another movie just like it.

139,w00f,A Decent Halloween Haunted House Flick,7,23 October 2004,"Not great (I think The Ring was light years beyond this one on my personal fearometer), but I'd recommend it as a fun Halloween flick that's perfect for those who can't shell out the $50+ entrance fee for an amusement park spooking.For the most part, The Grudge is an old-fashioned haunted house movie. What's new here is mainly that ghosts are portrayed in pretty high-tech ways these days, but this is definitely a ""things that go bump in the night"" story. It's fright value lies mostly in the technique of the unexpected hand on the shoulder. It startles more often than it scares.Sara Michelle Gellar is OK in her role as the main character. I doubt this role stretched her acting abilities much; all she really had to do was act scared every so often, and was called upon to be largely deadpan between. Her character is mainly a lightning rod for spooky things to happen as the movie moves along. I should say, too, that the movie moves backwards and forwards along the plot line in various ways, and it sometimes comes off a bit choppy because of this. Bill Pullman has a small role; he starts off the story by jumping to his death off a sixth story apartment balcony, and the rest of the film unravels the reason why he's done this.The ghosts themselves are pretty effective. The effects people did a great job of combining some truly ghoulish makeup and some choice sound effects. The ghosts are, of course, the true stars of this movie, and everyone else is more or less window-dressing.All in all, I think this movie will scare people who haven't seen a lot of horror flicks more than it will those of us who have seen so many that they've lost count. Not that there isn't something to be had by jaded horror fans such as myself, too, but I suspect that most of us who have seen this kind of thing before can see the scares coming. The startling bits aren't that startling if you already know what's about to happen. People who haven't seen a lot of movies in this genre, however, are likely to loose a scream or two, as did the audience members in the theater where I saw the movie.And please, somebody buy Toshio a new scratching post and some catnip.

To say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw The Grudge.Some may say that it is a rip off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the Grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie.The acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he is having fun. However, while i am normally a fan of Clea DuVall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. Of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she?

142,timmy_501,A muddled mess,5,13 October 2013,"The Grudge is rather a mess of a film. Most obviously, the chronology and perspective constantly changes but the film is written in such a way that most of the flashbacks and perspective shifts primarily exist to give detail to information that has already been conveyed through exposition, or that is obvious through inference. As a result, most of the storytelling falls flat and the film lacks suspense since the viewer already knows what's going to happen most of the time. At the same time, none of the characters are really fleshed out so it's hard to care about them to begin with. Amusingly for an American version of this most of the principal characters just happen to be Americans living in Japan and mostly speaking English. If the film did anything at all with this cultural conflict it might be fun to ponder whether the apparitions just really hate Americans but alas, even this bit of fun is absent, and this is just another missed opportunity for some relatively obvious and easy character development that just doesn't show up. The other major problem with this film is that the actual spirit that is killing people is barely seen for the majority of the film and when it does show up it just comes across as an inferior version of the malevolent entity from The Ring, an obvious influence. Instead, most of the film uses the spirit of a young boy in a muddled way. The boy is somewhat creepy because of his appearance, which provides all the menace that can be summoned from black eye makeup and a generous slathering of corpse paint. At the same time, he still looks like a very young boy and, for me at least, this inspired the usual sympathetic feelings I have towards a young child. The juxtaposition between his appearance and this sympathy almost becomes something interesting but once the film seemed to imply that he might be responsible for the deaths of some adults the situation took a turn for the absurd because there really isn't that much menace to be had from any child unless there's something obvious to the menace beyond appearance. In any case, Shimizu overuses the child character and underuses the actual malevolent entity, not that she's all that threatening except in comparison to the boy. She's just a ghost with a ""grudge"" because she died in terrible pain and now she just kills people that come to her old house, because...well, the film certainly doesn't do anything to explain why she would want to kill people or why she mostly just haunts the house but sometimes leaves it to go after people that have been there before. Especially in comparison to The Ring, The Grudge fails to establish the power or motivation of its malevolent spirit at any point and in fact it's hard to imagine why she would be so powerful. All in all, this story simply isn't told very well and several aspects of it fail. It's hard to believe that this is actually the third or fourth time the director tried to tell this story given how poorly he tells it.",The Grudge

When a young housewife (Sarah Michele Geller) reluctantly goes to Japan with her architect husband, they land in a house that hasn't been inhabited for several years. Needless to say, it's haunted by spirits who seem particularly malignant, carrying the ""grudge"" of their awful fate to anyone who lives there.Various people associated with the house meet grim fates, mostly frightened to death. There's a sinister black cat, a winding staircase that's a ringer for the one in THE EXORCIST, and other devices that might lead you to think you've seen this film before. However, this doesn't detract from the simple fact that THE GRUDGE is creepy and great fun to watch. The locations give this a special flavor as well.

For me it is far from horror perhaps in the ""Retarded"" genre.The story set in where else but Tokyo where an American nurse (Gellar) finds a scary house with a curse upon it. That is about all I know about the story really I couldn't pay attention to it. It was more like the Ring, the guy and girl look for the truth then the guy dies. JUST LIKE THE RING. Of course saying Japan hasn't had a good horror movie since well maybe Godzilla and that was a guy in a costume! The tag-line It never forgives, It never forgets well my version is You'll never forgive yourself for watching it, You'll never forget the stupidity of it. My final rating 1/10.",The Grudge

Both of them shared the same nonsensical, jumbled plot and lengths of boredom (I had to fight back the yawns!). The jump scares (and ghosts) did work a tiny bit better in the remake but in the end, still didn't do anything for me. The original might have the edge in sound effects though, which in my opinion was the best quality of these two films. The story and settings were quite similar between the two, though I believe the ending was slightly different in Ju-on. Also, I don't recall the jawless ghost (good scene) being in Ju-on. Anyway, I must say I really prefer Ringu and The Ring to Ju-on and The Grudge, though I didn't find those movies all that good either. I'll take The Eye over all of 'em.",The Grudge

I just didn't really like it that much; however there were a couple of scenes that did get the audience to jump a little bit to the edge of their seats but most of them just got laughed off. One person even shouted out 'bring on Godzilla' during one of the Japanese detective scenes because it was downgrading to pure cheese relatively quickly...which definitely added some comic relief. I didn't think the actors were effective either since they usually utilized only a handful of expressions for the movie's entirety. The plot fell way short and just didn't add up and the time-line storyboard while meant to give it an intelligent feel...collapsed as well. I also felt that this whole movie was made to promote the sequel, which I don't know if they're going to make it but I certainly was overcome by that impression. The idea was there, but they exploited it instead of realizing its full potential.Final Time:Movies: Worth it in no such way!DVD Purchase: Have no intentions whatsoever.Rental: Possibly a good Halloween flick but that's about it.",The Grudge

Obviously, I think the main star (Sarah Michelle Gellar) can direct a better movie than the director, Takashi Shimizu, which did an original one of this movie in Japanese (you can tell by his name). But then he thought Americans wanted to see this, too. So he did the movie over with American stars in it and in English. In my opinion, it was average. It had a cruel story to it and it did not have a happy ending. The movie takes place in a haunted house with a dead kid with a big mouth and a cat scream and a dead lady that sounds like she's burping all the time and a dead man that you don't see. Stupid movie and didn't really have a main point. It was just about haunted house with dead people cursing everyone who crossed the doorstep. It may have good actors in it but it has a mediocre plot.

This movie honestly doesn't even make the most sense. And the ghost is pretty dumb looking...and makes an annoying noise that actually made me laugh. Especially the ending, I was just bored out of my mind at least I could find some comedy in this miserable so called film. I really don't get why this scares people, is it the sound the ghost makes?

154,das417,Mixed Feelings,5,27 February 2005,"I have mixed feelings about The Grudge. With most movies, I have a pretty strong feelings in terms if I like it, hate it, or just think it's amusing. However, this is a different and I am not too sure why.Let me say that I have never seen the original. Since I have seen the American version, I am tempted to go and rent the original so I can compare and probably have a better view of this movie. But that will be later.This is what I liked. First of all, the direction was good as well as the effects created by the environments of the house, flashbacks, etc. The movie itself, on a whole, was well made and edited. Unlike other thrillers, the feeling of suspense wasn't too much or too little.However, here are the problems. First of all, I think Sarah Michelle Gellar's part should have gone to a Japanese actress. I know this was made for an American audience, but it would have been more powerful if a Japanese character was made central to the story. Not a American exchange student doing her best to fit into the culture. The other Americans could still be included, but a Japanese actress with Gellar's part would have added something.In reading the trivia section provided by IMDb, I read that the movie was edited to a pg-13 rating, cutting out more of the graphic scenes. I think that was another bad decision because more of the violent memories (or flashbacks, I don't know what they actually were of course), would have given the audience a more intimate sense of what happened in that house. What scenes were provided at the end of the movie, when Geller sees what happened to the woman and her son, was well done. I can only speculate that the scenes edited out where more like that.However, despite my misgivings about The Grudge, I have to say that it was better then I thought it would be. It was also better then The Ring which still baffles me in terms of why so many people liked it. More graphic scenes and better casting could have made it much better though. It will be interesting to see how a sequel works. My mixed feelings still stand, thus the reason I give this movie five out of ten.",The Grudge

This was just another Hollywood movie. I bet they had censorship for this movie to make it available for the wider audience.Did they really think this'd be scary at all? I really thought this'd be something because it had a Japanese director and it was filmed in Japan, i presume. People disappearing, some ghost under the blanket and whooosh, there you go! Sounds and looks like a fairytale which i'd tell my children.The biggest drawback was Sarah-Michelle Gellar, whatever, i knew she'd not act well, in a believable way! According to her TV series, Buffy, The vampire slayer, she's just a b-class actress. Whatever that means, after this movie i'd rate her to c-class. But don't get me wrong, she's just a wonderful person in a wrong profession.After all, this had some classic material in it, but they just spoiled it with censorship and bad attitude. The movie ends in a very predictable way, and at a point i'd have not expected it to end. I had to ask myself that was this really IT!",The Grudge
157,Gambitt,Your Average Bump in the Dark,5,11 November 2004,"**Minor Spoilers**My girlfriend loves horror flicks, and lately we've been experimenting with some of the more successful Japanese horror movies. We (well, more she) were quite excited to see ""The Grudge"" when it first came out several weeks ago.The theater was packed with teeny boppers, and the theater was constantly filled with chatter and repeating pattern of *SCREAM* *giggling and chatter* *SCREAM* *giggling and chatter* *SCREAM* ... rinse, repeat etc. etc.Nevertheless I more or less stayed focused on the film. It certainly had its moments. Shimizu maximizes his BOO!-moments with creative camera angles and shots, and occasional gore. If cheap shots that make you jump are all you want, then The Grudge is definitely for you.Where it fails is in its plain-jane, run-of-the-mill horror plot. There is nothing different, new, clever, or unexpected. There are no twists, turns, or mindbenders. The house is haunted, and that's it.Furthermore, I'm not sure why Shimizu chose to recreate the movie with an almost entirely American/caucasian cast. Since he retains the Japanese settings, an American audience nevertheless run into the occasional cultural oddity. It seems pandering that almost every major character is white while the surrounding area is Japan. If the goal was to sellout to an American audience, why not simply go 100 yards and set the movie in America? Throw in not-so-stellar acting, especially by Gellar, and you end up with a pretty mundane horror flick. I give ""The Grudge"" a 5 / 10 : fairly average and forgettable. If you want a horror movie with more depth, more creative plot, and a more lasting impression, see The Ring or The Others.",The Grudge

There are some decent jump scares throughout, but other than that it's pretty much your standard haunted house story. Except this one's set in Japan, a choice which I cannot understand at all. It made all those gaijins stick out like sore thumbs and I kept wondering what Ted Raimi was doing in Japan. The writing was sophomoric, the acting was uninspired and the direction felt like a Japanese director doing an American version of his original Japanese story.

Not Japanese or American enough to be any good, it takes the worst elements of both and combines them into a $2.99 Teriyaki Chicken Meal. Five stars out of ten.",The Grudge

160,Phantasm01,Why all the negative comments?,8,24 June 2006,"Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences. While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film. The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films. Normally, there is this big ""jumping out of the darkness"" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of ""here I am"" that frightened me more than most films do.Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan. This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue. I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan. This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film. It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew. I thought that this kept the entire film grounded. It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning ... there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America ... we were in Japan. This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film. I was impressed.The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project. Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film. Gellar was the exact same. She did her part, collected her money, and went home. This wasn't what frightened me about this film. I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting. I expected average acting and that is what I got. What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film. That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals. His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest. Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work. It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released. This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.Overall, I loved this movie. It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for. There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula. There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre. This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film. From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared. This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film!",The Grudge

Maybe because I didn't expect anything at all when I watched it. I didn't expect getting scared. I didn't know anything about it either.

Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge-films, but even though I haven't seen them, I believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually. This film stands on it its own.The story is weak, most people say. I don't agree. The story is minimalistic, and done so on purpose. The story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done.

162,walken_on_sunshine,The Grudge:The Doc's Review,7,21 October 2006,"This re-make of the Japanese cult hit is a new and improved version of Takashi Shimizu's JU-ON.The Grudge focuses on scaring you with very effective jump scares and disturbing images,which occur throughout the entire film a lot of the time when you least expect it.The Grudge does what most horrors do not do and that is bend the rules of the classic setting of the haunted house.In everyday American horror usually the main character is tormented by the inhabitants of the house,then they leave the house to be safe,and then find a way to stop it.The Grudge isthe opposite which is a very pleasant surprise,when you leave thishaunted house you are sure as hell not safe.The interesting thingis that generally those who die in horror films either deserve it or have something to do with the conflict but in The Grudge everyday people who even set one foot in the house are doomed to perish.I think that The Grudge is very original,very unique,and very effective at inflicting fear into it's audience.The storyline however is hard to follow at times and can be very confusing but without taking anything away from the movie.The Grudge is also full of typical horror film clichés but for the most part is very original and different.The acting is top notch as far as horror flicks go and the characters are all believable and easy to buy into.The Grudge is a must see horror film.",The Grudge

I must admit and think what you like but the only reason i went to see this was Sarah Michelle Gellar. I hadn't heard of this being a remake as Sam Raimi and SMG were the only names plastered on the posters and i hadn't read one review. So i went to see this and wow, i was caught after the first scene with Bill Pullman, the weirdness and emptiness of him standing on the balcony intrigued me more than the events that followed. Shocked!Up until 3/4 of the way through the movie i was clinching at the arm rests and desperately trying to look away from the screen but not being able to. Whenever there was a jump i jumped and the sequence of events that befall the unfortunate American family that enter the house including the lady who wasn't even living there, just part of the family, absolutely terrified me. When i told people about it the next day, just remembering the scenes sent chills down my spine.My only problem was that there weren't enough Japanese people in this, they were in Japan and there were only about 5 Japanese people in the movie who all spoke very good English. This could have been a great horror version of Lost in Translation had the only American non Japanese speaking people been Sarah and her boyfriend. But it rocked anyway so i don't hold a grudge. This movie just scared the hell out of me and most of my friends who saw it, quite a few had trouble sleeping. This movie rocks",The Grudge
164,El-Stumpo,Let this curse die right here,1,2 November 2007,"Ten minutes into The Grudge I started to think about another recent movie, which is always cause for alarm bells. Though hardly a memorable movie, The Butterfly Effect ends with Ashton Kutcher beaming himself into his mother's womb and strangling himself with his umbilical cord, in the belief he should never have existed. Oh boy. There's a p*ss-easy metaphor for this pointless remake that should never have seen the light of day. Sitting in the cinema on my left is The Grudge's target audience: the Wide-Eyed Western Pig. A slack-jawed foot soldier for Hollywood's war of cultural imperialism, he trades the art-house for the megaplex as he prefers their fake butter flavor on his popcorn, views ""Blockbuster"" as a seal of quality, and wants a cute, familiar, WHITE face to focus on. Elsewhere the Horror Fetishist, a sad Pavlovian creature conditioned to lick its own d*ck whenever the name ""Sam Raimi"" appears on screen, is busy doing a lap of honor during the opening credits. These people have money. These people vote. These bottom-feeders are the mindless consumers the Dream Factory keeps chained to cigarette machines and Gold Lotto slips. Buds: this Grudge is for YOU. The original Ju-on: The Grudge, the story of a self-perpetuating curse centering on a family's tragic murder-suicide, was an effective if empty and ultimately silly variant on the seemingly endless Ring cycle and was itself spawned from two TV movies. At this point producer Sam Raimi, no virgin to the concept of franchise, waved a huge sack o'cash under director Takashi Shimizu's inscrutable gaze, not for him to reinterpret the movie, but to do a carbon copy of it. In Japan, with a Japanese crew. Virtually scene for scene, and in some cases shot for shot, on an almost-identical set, but with wide-eyed western stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Bill Pullman. The message here? Money will make it better. Dance, monkey. Do a jig to the tune of two thousand megaplex cash registers all chiming at once. Jump through the hoops just a little faster, 'cos Buffy wants a new series. If the original Grudge had anything unique, it was its innate ""Japanese-ness"". Not so here. There's no sense of mounting horror in Shimizu's tired retread which gives the game away in the first 10 minutes, leaving its shocks all the more absurd. To add insult, its episodic structure has been tampered with by a Hollywood scriptwriter who explains away the inexplicable. Surely producer Raimi, while counting down the paychecks till Evil Dead 4, must have realized the Japanese horror film is like a bonsai tree, in its own culture a thing of symmetry, beauty and perfection. Stick it in a tiled pot in the Mall outside Hoyts Regent and it becomes a stupid looking tree. This isn't just a case of a remake, an updating or yet another pointless sequel. This is unmitigated arrogance - Hollywood saying ""do it OUR way, and we can all make a chunk of change"". Shimizu should have learned the lessons of history. The original directors of two effective European chillers The Vanishing and Nightwatch were both sent packing to the States to ""Americanize"" their movies. Does anyone remember George Sluizer or Ole Bornedal? Did anyone give a rat's *ss about the remakes? It's even more proof the Dream Factory has gone bankrupt for ideas, and Scrooge McDuck is at the helm, throwing cloth bags with dollar signs on them even further afield. This is a war, make no mistake, and for the moment the Wide-Eyed Western Pig is winning. What next? Ang Lee's remake of Crouching Tiger... with Casper Van Dien?

It flows well, continuity is very good, scripting is good, nice camera technique with good photography, good sound track, subdued special effects that work real well in a movie like this with no ""over the top"" silliness, and I liked the plot.

Resembling parts of ""The Ring"" and ""Sixth Sense"", although not as good as those, it has it's moments. In fact, it had some very creepy moments in it. But I do have to admit that in some parts it was really hard to follow, and all the flashback scenes got old. Not your typical haunted house movie, although it takes a while to start to understand exactly what the hell is going on. One thing that I had trouble with was parts where the young girl(s) hear something upstairs, where it is dark and creepy, and they have to go investigate instead of getting the hell out of there.

167,aeo,Boring.,3,25 October 2004,"I give this movie two stars out of ten. This movie is a American remake of a Japanese horror movie called Juon. The basic premise of the story is a bunch of deaths related to a haunted house in Japan. Michelle Gellar plays an exchange student in Japan who goes to this haunted house in Tokyo to look after an invalid American woman after the original caretakers disappeared. That's when the fun begins or lack thereof.Anyone who has seen Japanese cinema knows horror movies from Japan are heavily into suspense without much special effects. I remember reading some news magazine that was profiling Japanese cinema and one interviewee stated that Japanese cinemas do not have the budget like Hollywood movies to use many special effects. Therefore, they have to use mood, camera angles, and such to create suspense in their movies.Now I like this type of movie making. It reminds me of the classic thriller/horror genre of American cinemas in the 1940's and 1950's. That being said, most of this movie was not scary. Like a typical Japanese movie, the movie dragged on too long in some scenes and there is a reason for this. It makes the audience lull into complacency not expecting anything in particular, which makes the happening of a thrilling event much more scary. But again, there is just too many of these types of scenes.If you like Ringu, you might like this movie but Ringu was much more unique in its premise than your common haunted house theme. One of my friends told me that the Japanese version is slightly better than the American version and had offered to loan me his copy but I don't think I am going to see it. I did not like this movie and I was not scared at all.I would have given this movie one out of ten stars but I like Michelle Gellar so I am willing to give it an extra star.",The Grudge

Now, this movie is based on the Japanese movie Ju-On. I have not seen that movie so no comparisons can be made by me between the two. The plot is very typical. A house is the stage for a bizarre incident and since then the house is haunted affecting everyone that steps in it.A routine movie where someone gets affected (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is now trying to understand the mystery behind the place to try and save herself. In a horror movie, you know for sure that unless it is totally different that when a person is stepping in dark place alone and the camera is slowing down then something is going to happen. And when you expect something to happen and it does you hardly get the goose bumps.However, that is for the experienced movie goer. But for someone not too used to movies maybe this will still produce the thrills it is meant to produce. I recall seeing only one scene where the incident or event was totally unexpected and got on my nerves. Unlike the Ring which I call as an intelligent horror movie it does not get you too involved.

This film is not at least bit scary. In fact, I think they are reaching the bottom of the reasoning barrow when they try to explain why, what was happening was happening. I thought the sound effects blew big monkey chunks, the makeup was horrible and ineffective of bringing any type of chills to the screen and the story was unfocused. Perhaps something got lost in the translation or that Japanese horror yawns are just not that scary in the USA (although The Ring was excellent). I don't know what this movie was trying to do and I don't think the director did either. The way he treated his victim did not make any sense. Sarah Michelle Geller was just OK. She didn't get to do much in the way of interacting with the story (in my humble opinion only) and she IS the main character. I think this film try to be a bit slicker than it needed to be. It's OK to try something different, just make it coherent. Actually I found the film quite laughable in parts and boring in others.

171,padiyark,Not a good crossbreed of Japanese and American films,4,22 October 2004,"I like a lot of the neo-Japanese films because they dare to push the envelope. Take films like ""Audition"" (makes ""Fatal Attraction"" look sloppy) or even ""Zatoichi"" (which mix the ancient with the new). But there are neo-Japanese films that become redundant, like ""Tomie"". So when I heard ""The Grudge"", which was based on the Japanese film of the similar name, was coming out and it was directed by the same director of the Japanese film, I was definitely intrigued.Just came from the film, and it pretty much sucked. Yeah, sucked. Though I liked the photography (by Hideo Yamamoto of ""Ichi the Killer"" and ""Audition"") and the fact that Ryo Ishibashi, the main actor from ""Audition"", was in it, the rest of this movie just falls more into the American schlock-shock fest. Though the concept had great potential, we kind of get the idea from the 1st 30 minutes what is going on. On top of this, put in the usual scary faces, violin shrieks, and the little gremlin who meows creepy, and you got your general teen shock flick. Sarah Michelle Gellar really does not add much to the film, not to mention that her and her fiancée's part were really unnecessary in the film. This could have been explored more from the Japanese detective's point of view (no, this is not a spoiler). I really cannot recommend this film unless you're easily scared. Half the theatre was laughing (kind of like ""Exorcist IV""). The movie had potential to be a good crossbreed of Neo-Japanese and American film, but failed miserably secondary to the greater emphasis on cheap American scare tactics and less development/innovation on the Japanese part. Even more disappointing is the fact that Sam Raimi, the great ""Evil Dead"" I and II director, actually produced this garbage.4/10",The Grudge

173,Juan_from_Bogota,Very similar to the ring,2,24 February 2007,"This movie shows the pattern that follows some successful films: the imitation; the girl is specially a ""ring type"" girl, with the blue body and the hair black over her face; in some parts of the movie, it resembles almost exactly the ring: Attention the next part could be a spoiler! (ej: in the part when the police officer put a VHS tape on the recorder and begin to watch the security recording, watch it and you will see a ring scene!!). Scary? yes but 50 times less than the ring, and in the story at the beginning of the film they say that the curse remain in the place, but if this is true, why the girl and the boy are in the whole city?, just something to analyze. If you read this comment, i don't want you to not see the film; go get scared! and grab the arm of your couple or the one nearest to you, scream!, have a good time!, but you can also analyze this ""ring patterns"" and have some fun.",The Grudge
174,mrspasm,"Woman, cat, boy",10,17 June 2009,"To be honest this film doesn't have an awful lot going for it. It's Chinese, it has too many women in it, and the order is all jumbled up so you don't know what day it is or if someone is alive or dead or both. At least it bucks the recent trend of hilarious screamers which started with Scream, you know, those films that try to scare you and make you funny at the same time. There is no comedy here (though the wee boy in the cupboard was quite funny) and unfortunately there are no scares here either (though the wee boy in the cupboard was quite scary). It is a remake of the Chinese TV series 'Why Does This Lady With The Hair Have An Angry Against Me, Daddy?' There isn't really a plot or, it's just a pile of things happening involving a haunted house. One girl goes to the house; she thinks it's evil, has a look around, and gets sucked into the attic by a big hairy woman. Another girl replaces the last one, goes to the house and meets a little boy who seems to be made of chalk and speaks like a cat. The big hairy woman comes out and gets her too. The rest of the film involves police, school girls, and others going to the house and getting chased from room to room by the big hairy woman. In one frankly bizarre scene, one girl who escaped the house goes home and goes to the toilet. She sits down and begins doing her business. She knows something is amiss. The scary music starts. Is she alone? Is she safe? The door creaks! Everyone jumps. Her phone rings! Everyone jumps. Plop! Everyone jumps. She looks around the house, but no-one is there so she goes back to the toilet for more. She twitches, thinking something is tickling her bum. Again. And again. She gets up and looks down the toilet (dirty girl) and suddenly- BOO! The hairy woman is in the toilet! She grabs the girl and pulls her down into the darkness. Later, when her boyfriend comes home he goes to the toilet, opens the lid only to find his dead girlfriends head poking round the U bend, one leg bent beside her ear.As enjoyable as that sounds it really isn't. I haven't been able to go to the toilet sitting down since. Yes, I have to stand, facing the toilet at all times. I'm sure you can imagine the shapes I've had to put myself into in order to successfully deposit my mail. The rest of the film had less impact, and raised more questions than answers- why was the woman there? Why had the boy swallowed his cat? Why did everyone start crawling around the house, and why didn't someone just chuck a few grenades down the chimney and be done with it? Interestingly this Buffy spin off doesn't feature Gellar at her toughest. It would have been better if she's called in Giles, Willow, and Xander and they could have talked out the problem and then stake ass. Maybe it was all a nightmare.Best Scene: When the Chinese woman was walking up the stairs and you could almost see her pants.",The Grudge

This may be intentional; in one of the final scenes, we see that Peter (Bill Pullman) can sense the presence of Karen in the room some three years later.SPOILER ALERT: To straighten out the timeline, this is the order in which the thirteen deaths are shown: 7,5,6,8,9,10,4,11,1,2,3,12,13. That is, although Yoko's death is the first shown in the movie, it was actually the seventh to occur. The deaths occurred in this order: The Japanese woman Kayako and her son Toshio were murdered by her jealous husband Takeo, who then killed himself. Peter died shortly after (killed by the ghost of Toshio.) Three years later, Jean was killed, followed by her husband. Yoko arrived and was killed. The mother Emma died (and Karen ended up in the hospital. That evening, Susan (Emma's daughter) died, never having gotten word that her whole family was dead. Alex (Karen's boss) was killed by the ghost of Yoko) and the police inspector was killed by the ghost of the Takeo.

For one thing, you never known all the story - just enough to leave you knowing that you missed something and you can't always figure out what. The movie stays with you longer.And another thing: Japanese ghosts are a heck of a lot scarier than American ghosts - I mean, how many American ghosts can leave the haunted house to kill someone?

177,Rooster99,Much better than I thought it would be.,8,2 February 2005,"This was great. When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I nearly had a heart attack... I was concerned that the American version would be watered down, and that Buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. I needn't have been concerned. The makers of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. That actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of ""Strangers in a Strange Land"" to the overall horror. Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch.Buffy actually does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. There are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to American horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed. I hope the future of American horror follows more closely the Japanese New Wave of horror started with the incredible success of Ringu. We are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as ""Horror""!! 8/10",The Grudge
178,zactac,Truly scary!!!,9,16 October 2009,The Grudge is one of best ghost movies of the decade. It has scares coming out of every corner. When I first saw it I couldn't sleep for weeks. Sometimes I still can't sleep. Thats what makes this movie so scary and amazing. One of the things that just get to me so much is the main villains death rattle. When I hear something like that I just can't help but feel scared. This movie has gotten to me so much sometimes I can't even cover up at night because of some of the scenes it had. One of the things I didn't like to much was how it kept switching to new people. Besides that the scenery was dark and scary making it the perfect set up for this destructive evil to come for its victims. A must see for horror movie lovers.,The Grudge
179,Clintekabor,Actually the face of that child is like a real ghost,6,20 June 2021,"I think the grudge is one of those films that if you watched it back when it was first released then it would have felt terrifying, and it would have seemed a little more unique.The atmosphere is eerie, dark and foreboding. The Japanese cityscape in the background didn't appeal to me much but luckily the backstory and interior setting kept my mind focused on other areas of the film.The Grudge biggest appeal is it's sinister dead woman who's ghastly croaking, sticky movements, crackling limbs, and ominous facial expression really instills a different fear directly into your soul.It's still a terrifying image today and really goes to show that you can forge a truly unique character that becomes iconic and can be built into franchises.As for the story, I did feel a little let down. I mean it was good but wasn't sensational. The appeal about the family, their dark secrets and flashback sequences were the most interesting aspects of the film.I'm not disappointed or enthralled by the the film as a whole.

181,pressboard,Buffy meets Kubuki,5,28 August 2005,"The review by Togasaurus I think describes this movies structure and intent best. Americans look for ghosts (spirits) who have a reason for being, an intent, a location and a resolution. On the other hand, the Japanese believe in a more basic animism. The spirit is independent of the person who died and exists as the embodiment of an emotion - in this case rage. The spirits and the atmosphere in which they are revealed is done excellently - but there is no motivation or resolution. They are rage. They are not limited to a location, but can manifest anywhere where the victims happen to be. Supposedly, they pass their rage on to their victims. Their victims then die and new rage spirits are born. The spirits, at least in this movie, are not banished or exorcised. They continue to exist and continue to kill. Most of this is not communicated in The Grudge. You either know the culture or you do not. From what I was reading I guess this rage was passed on to most Americans who saw this movie. Watching The Grudge I felt like I was on the verge of really liking this movie, but was lacking the necessary understanding to do so - a strange feeling.

I don't care if these types of movies plots make no sense, but at least have the decency to have a few scares in it. It was crap from the get go.

183,underfire35,Read The Label Before Viewing.........,2,21 May 2005,"THE GRUDGE:Type: Slick Hollywood remake of a (better) foreign horror film (see also THE RING).Ingredients: A cast featuring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Grace Zabriskie, Bill Pullman, Ted Raimi, Yoko Maki, William Mapother, Ryo Ishibashi who seem out of place in a Tokyo setting, most of whom converse in English. Confused characters who basically stare at the camera and continue to walk into a house where horrible things happen on a constant basis. A disjointed adapted screenplay by Steven Susco. Aloof direction by Takashi Shimizu who made the original foreign language film called JU-ON: THE GRUDGE (see also THE VANISHING for similar poor results of a director translating his own interesting thriller to the American screen). A decent, though derivative, musical score by Christopher Young. Flat lifeless cinematography by Lukas Ettlin and Hideo Yamamoto. A whole lot of cheap thrills, unpleasant images, musical stings, loud sound effects, poorly integrated special effects, implausible situations and an ending that seems to have been added after multiple test screenings. Side Effects: May cause drowsiness, fatigue, rolling of eyes, nausea, regret at having paid to see the film. Do not operate VCR or DVD equipment in the event that THE GRUDGE is present in home. Viewers may experience a certain feeling of ""sameness"" if they have seen any horror films prior to THE GRUDGE. Confusion pertaining to what this film is about would not be an uncommon reaction either. A complete lack of interest in the characters (performed by a cast that has very little to do) may cause boredom, or a sense of detachment from the on-screen events. Avoid if relentless gore and violence (in place of any real plot) has a negative effect on you....In fact, my recommendation would be to simply avoid THE GRUDGE altogether.Refills: No thanks.2/10",The Grudge

Texas Chainsaw Massacre was scary in 2003, but that was then, right before the Ring came out. That was the first Japanese movie to come out in full charge. Not many before succeeded as well. The Ring started a whole line of extreme horror films, such as: When Darkness Falls, The Village, and now The Grudge.The Grudge wasn't anything you haven't seen before, to be honest. It's not just scary, it's Japanese scary. Most American made films don't compete against Japanese films, they just don't, sorry to say. They think everything through, knowing that we won't understand. Then when we watch it, and see that half of it is in Japanese, we become confused and don't believe it's a good movie. The Grudge was a cry for attention really, to compete with the Ring.5 out of 10, nothing good, nothing bad. Very scary, but is becoming redundant. There will be a new horror film out soon trying to take this movie over. It won't be too hard, seeing as the ending for The Grudge made all the faces of the audience scrunch up in a ""what the hell"" sort of look.

It was weird because the funny noise made me feel a tad sick, it wasn't scary but I did feel a little uneasy after watching it. I watched it with ten of my 13year-old friends and half of them thought it was silly and un-scary, the other half are afraid to get in bed because they are afraid that they will get pulled under by the Grudge...

Anyways all kinds of weird stuff starts happening in that house to everybody who gets involved with it.Like I said, Sarah Michelle Geller is pretty acceptable in this role as Karen, she does manage to get scared and all, but we still see ""Buffy"" when she's facing scary stuff, that's not very cool. Bill Pullman is there for like 10 minutes, but anyways I thought he did OK, and everybody else in the cast, special mention to the Japanese actors/actresses.Anyhow, if you feel like watching a movie that I'm sure it'll give you a good scare at least once, please rent this movie :) ***1/2 out of *****",The Grudge

The only problem in doing this with The Grudge, is that they couldn't really just redo it word-for-word like The Ring because the story is so open-ended that it wouldn't have been 'well-accepted' by American audiences. I have seen the original Grudge, titled Ju-On, and was a fan of it, mainly because it incites so much discussion because it's confusing and erratic. These are actually good things about that movie though because you really 'choose-your-own-ending' in your mind.Now in the American version, we have a very neat, pat, and, somewhat disappointing, ending. The scary images of the original are still the same and I really enjoyed the directors' cool horror shots. The lightening and sound effects are just horror movie perfection! Still, the story was just lacking something for me and there isn't much to discuss when the movie is over. Out theater was full of teens though who actually SCREAMED during the film. It's been awhile since I've heard actual screaming, so it does provide some good terror. I know I jumped as well. If you're a fan of horror, I'd say it's worth the price of a matinée.",The Grudge

When the spirits made their appearances and were menacing someone, the scenes appeared to be totally without context and only seemed like something cool the director had come up with during filming - ""Hey, let's try this thing out!"" The spirits were very spooky, but very poorly used.

Basically, it's a slow moving movie, almost exactly like its predecessor, using the same sets and some of the same stars as well. Unfortunately the first movie wasn't that good either, but because it was original I gave it a higher rating than this version. One of my reasons being that the scariest moment in the first movie is about the only scene not duplicated in this remake (that of a woman staring down on the lady in bed while Toshio scratches his legs at the foot of it, as seen in the previews of the original.)

However, this was a little weird in terms of presentation.Still effective, not to mention imaginative, but seemed to get a little silly at times. When the effective scenes did come, though, they were definitely chilling. The ending was a little disappointing, too.

199,Venge,Great Atmosphere,8,30 October 2004,"The Grudge is a horror movie in a style that has become quite popular to players of horror video games out of Japan. For anyone who has played Fatal Frame II, or a game in the Silent Hill series, this movie has that same send of creepy foreboding that can give you goosebumps. Like the games, ""The Grudge"" does not lay out a direct but often ridiculous premise like American horror movies. There is no lakeside retreat that has been the sight of a countless slaughters of college kids over the years but just happens to attract one more group of kids who seems intent on being the next victims. In the case of ""The Grudge"" we only know that there is a house, a very very strange house, and that anyone who happens to enter this house begins to experience their own private horror. We do not know why at first, tho as the movie progresses the reasons are explained through a series of glimpses into past events. I was pleased to see that even the flashbacks are handled in a truly frightening way. The movie didn't scare me, rather I found it wickedly creepy and suspenseful. Others in the audience were truly frightened, as I saw it in a very full house, and heard more genuine screams of fear then I have heard in a theater in many years. The atmosphere of the movie was superb. There were many times you did not want to have to watch the actors take another step forward into that dark room at the end of the hall. The setting in Japan worked well for me, as I liked the disconnected hopelessness of the largely western cast trying to come to terms with a strange culture and instead facing a nightmare that they cannot begin to fathom.If you are expecting ""Nightmare on Elm Street Part 14"" or ""Scary Movie 12"" then this one may not be for you. This is not all hack and slash with lots of gratuitous violence. However, if you like atmospheric horror movies, and especially if you like stylized Japanese horror, then you will appreciate this movie. The director does not even try to answer all the questions that arise, but the lack of rational explanations to the horrific events which take place actually add to the overall sense of dread.",The Grudge
200,MarshallStax,Content with no context,4,28 October 2004,"This movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable ""gotcha!"" at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. There are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms. It's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like ""The Ring"") take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out, two-dimensional excuses for human characters.This English-language version of ""The Grudge"" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you ought to be living on.Not recommended.",The Grudge
201,cobbler88,"'The Ring,' but lesser (spoilers)",6,29 October 2004,"The viewing experience in ""The Grudge"" is almost identical to ""The Ring."" In neither movie is there really much of a payoff for the viewer at the end in terms of actually bothering to take care of any of the loose ends. I thought both films were ""jumpers"" that had me in goosebumps at times ... for the first few instances that called for it. At least in ""The Ring,"" there is some plot development and search into a complex history to explain what is going on before they disappoint the viewer. In ""The Grudge,"" the back story isn't complicated at all, and explanations are still in short supply. First, why are the original innocent victims suddenly murderous ghosts? I imagine they're not thrilled by the way they left the mortal coil, but that doesn't really explain why they just keep killing ... and killing. Besides, logic following, wouldn't the new victims also become murderous? There wouldn't be anyone left on the planet after a week, which might explain why ...... apparently there are only around 2,000 people living in Tokyo, which I believe this was set in. Every time anyone's pursued, every street, hallway, parking lot and corridor is completely devoid of people. In a huge office building at night, the only two people there are a security guard and a transplanted American? And has anyone heard of light switches? Most of the time, characters don't even attempt to turn on lights when they investigate strange noises. They just walk, scared, into dimly-lit rooms or crawl spaces. 'Also, for a haunted house flick, the murderous apparitions are able to do a surprising amount of traveling about town to claim their victims.Ultimately, like ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge"" starts out promising, but leaves many viewers feeling cheated at the end. I hesitate to call the latter a clone of the former, though. I'm not an expert on Japanese culture or cinema, but it's entirely possible that their view of what makes for suspense is simply different than our own. Maybe, as Americans, we want too much bundled neatly in a package by the end of a movie.But I believe this movie fell short in that it failed to explain the simplest thing in a horror movie, which is why, logically, the slayers are killing people.",The Grudge
202,ashecatlin,"Good movie, a little long at times",6,27 October 2020,"It's been forever since I've seen this, I thought I remember quite a lot of it but turns out I didn't. What I did remember well all the Kayoko scenes which were all fantastic, from the under the cover to the floating spirt, I loved every scene with her in.What I didn't really like in this were any of the characters, I just didn't care for any of them. The non linear story telling didn't help that either, it took a lot of suspense out of it because you know what is going to happen. As it's revealed in the segments before, out of all the segments I like Susan's the most. It had the most atmosphere with Kayako kind of playing with the victim, it was simply amazing. The same can't be said for the rest, a lot of the time things felt a little dragged out. I really didn't care for Karen she is portrayed as being more important that she is, unlike the Japanese version she is given a lot more screen time in this, but they never add anything to the character.I really liked Ted Raimi in this, I'm not if it's because of who he is or his character but I was just hooked whenever he was on screen. The same can be said with Kayako and Toshiro. I didn't real like the reveal that she had been stalking some school teacher, which lead to her death. Her journal saying that she loved him, felt a bit off with the series. I don't recall that in the originals either, I think it's much more creepy when the husband doesn't have a reason to kill her.Overall I enjoyed it, there were some moments where it was a bit too long. The detective was probably the most interesting character, even though he didn't get a lot of screen time. The explosive ending is easily the best moment of the movie, It's not the masterpiece I remember it being but I still had a lot of fun watching it, I do think the sequel is a lot better.",The Grudge
203,RandomTask-AP,Irresistible Horror,7,30 January 2005,"Ghosts stories are always creepy when it is in a decrepit old mansion at the far reaches of a small town. A ghost story that takes place in a modern Japanese bungalow in a residential district of one of the most densely populated cities in the world is creepier by putting the eerily aggravated poltergeists right next to everyday life. The frights come regularly and logically adhere to what little story there is. As a cinematic haunted hayride, this Americanized version of ""The Grudge"" succeeds with intelligence and reserve. It doesn't have anything to say, it just works like hell  and succeeds - in making you feel terrified.The prologue is a gruesomely realistic death that does not hint at the supernatural, but the story is told out of sequence. The reasons behind everything become clear with time. It is a device that that keeps you very naturally involved through curiosity. We are introduced to the house in question. The living people are a transplanted American couple with a catatonic mother-in-law and a local visiting nurse (Yoko, played by Yoko Maki). Yoko comes to visit the mother-in-law and they are the only ones home when noises come from upstairs. Naturally, Yoko goes upstairs to check in the midst of checking an answering machine message; only to disappear with an astonished scream after meeting the first ghost, Kayako (Takako Fuji). The care center sends a replacement when Yoko fails to report the next day. Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) follows in Yoko's footsteps through the messy house to the immobile patient and falls into a shocked state after a glancing introduction to the horrors. Fortunately, her supervisor (Ted Raimi) has become suspicious of the absences and comes looking for her and gets the police involved. The terror comes frequently and unrelentingly after this encounter. It expands to consume the family, the investigating police officers and everyone Karen cares for in Tokyo. The bounds of this ghostly rage are not simply to be escaped by leaving the property, staying awake or lasting until sunrise.Director Takashi Shimizu keeps everyone reined in with the emphasis on minimalism in both production and acting in this Americanized follow-up to his original ""Ju-On"". There are special effects to enhance the supernatural, but the horror is done largely with the physical: lights turn off without explanation, a knock at the door comes impossibly fast after the person at the far end ends a phone call. This control urges the audience to anticipate and this ratchets up the tension. Bill Pullman has proved in various roles that he is adept at bringing quiet intensity to roles and he does here. Every character is given equal respect and screen time. Although this is an ensemble cast, the headlining star on the poster is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Clearly she and her agent are trying to edge her away from the threat of the ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" role becoming a career buster. There are no sassy one-liners for her to fling at the monsters here. She is understated and finds a polite and frightened but upstanding demeanor to make Karen work. There is no melodramatic plot contrivance between events. People are drawn in by fear and curiosity. There are no ghost hunters, exorcists or supernatural experts of any kind here. The reasons for the ghosts' rage are hinted at through the characters' speculation and memories. Although I understand the original film is used as the back story.""The Grudge"" might not break new ground in creating a haunted house story, but it brings real terror, The camera isn't there to dazzle you, but rather to show you exactly what Shimizu wants you to see. You can't help but hold your breath for the next scare that comes forward to consume both characters and audience trapped like deer in headlights.7 out of 10",The Grudge

But for me it is -or at least was- way different.You see,this movie is a part of my childhood.It has to be one of the few and far between movies that ever scared me.I don't know why or how,but watching this movie as a kid i was very frightened. In fact the first time i saw this movie was when i was like 9 years old,and oh boy it did a number on me!It scared me so much that i still remember not having slept that damn night!Now almost 10 years after,still remembering some of the films' scenes,i said,hell,let's watch it again.Well,watching it now as an older person,as you can imagine it was a completely different experience.. Sadly i didn't find out what scared me so much as a kid,but i enjoyed having a sneak peek on my childhood through this movie.As long as the movie itself is concerned,it is a usual horror flick,with a lot of ""boo!"" scenes,if you know what i mean,and a messed up plot,but because it is a part of my childhood i'll give it 6/10!",The Grudge
205,mhajs,We're never involved.,5,6 June 2006,"**I know it would probably be nicer if I reviewed this movie after having seeing the original Japanese motion picture. But since the director is the same, the story is practically the same, overall, it's just an adaption, I watched The Grudge, yesterday night. Unfortunately, I wasn't pleased at all...The story is about a girl who goes to Japan for a living, working for some medical institution which gives support to helpless people, such as sick people. The girl is Sarah Michelle Gellar. After one of the other girls goes missing from work, Sarah is requested to take the girl's place by working at the house of a creepy family, who all have the bad luck of having bought the house. Well, it just happens that it's a cursed place.This is based on those Japanese legends where they say that when a person dies with rage or anger as the last feelings of life, the place becomes cursed itself. The main problem, I guess, with this movie, is that it takes a powerful legend such as this one, but doesn't show us almost anything interesting throughout the picture. We're never really involved and when something's about to happen, the scene cuts itself. Over and over and over again. All we have left to do is wonder, but never be frightened.There are many other flaws in The Grudge. The script is not so bad, I sincerely didn't think that way. The way the story is told, sometimes, in the present, flash-backing, and then moving forward again was quite interesting. However, The Grudge feels more like an experimental movie concerning situations where the characters seem completely lost and their actions don't have the impact of attitudes from characters of much better horror movies.",The Grudge
206,woinaroschy_1979,"After watching this, you'll never again feel completely safe in your own bed ...",9,6 September 2010,"This movie was a very pleasant surprise! Before the movie started I was thinking that it will be another usual horror movie with almost no plot and poor acting, lots of blood and teenagers dying left and right. Boy was I wrong! After about 5 minutes everyone in the cinema was quiet and during the movie everyone just froze with their popcorn buckets in their laps. No laughs, munching, sipping, mobile phones or anything. I think this truly shows the intensity of a movie. The movie is one of the scariest I have ever seen, and I think a great part of the fright is due to the fact that the movie uses actions and situations from everyday life to scare you. It gives you the feeling you'll never be safe, there is no place and no person that could protect you from this curse. The worst was the scene where this woman jumps in her bed and hides under the cover and then something grabs her from INSIDE the bed, that was right there with her under the cover. I mean, who did never hide under his cover with fear from the darkness or some noise in the house? After watching this scene, I lost for a while that feeling of safety in my own bed. And sometimes I still shiver remembering it. So yeah, it's a truly scary movie, both my husband and myself agree on that. That night when we came out of the cinema and had to walk home because it was past midnight we sure had a good look at every bush and tree. Well done movie, good plot, good acting (for a horror movie), great effects (especially sound effects) and camera. 9/10",The Grudge

If you read ""nougat"" on the wrapper of a candy bar, then you know you're getting NOUGAT! THE GRUDGE is like a candy bar. It is stylistically solid.There were American-remakes of Ringu and Ringu2, the one that started the buzz over trans-Pacific horror. The first Ringu tasted like brittle seaweed. It broke into a million fragments like the T-1000 and there were seaweed shreds all over the place. Ringu2 didn't taste too bad, although it still left a strange, swampy aftertaste in my mouth.THE GRUDGE is like a HEATH BAR -- with cat hair stuck in it. What would make me say such a thing? Well, if you look at the ingredients on the wrapper, THE GRUDGE was directed by Takashi Shimizu, the guy who did the original Japanese version. He threw in all those door creaks and angry black cats that tap you on the shoulder and say, ""Hey, you're on the security camera!"" You know how the saying goes, if it isn't broken, don't fix it. A Heath Bar works well as a Heath Bar.On the inside of the Heath Bar is the brick and mortar that the director poured into it, and the milk-chocolate layer represents the Hollywood stars who give the package an enticing allure.

208,Tikanjiah,It looks better than it feels,6,17 September 2005,"This movie looks good and is artistically creative. But, unless you're into that kind of thing or need a project for art school, it's style probably won't be enough to keep to interested in it.As far as the plot, it's like most remade Asian movies out there: lost in translation. I think producers believe they have to dumb down movies for American audiences. It certainly seems over the past years that they try to fit everything into a PG-13 so they can get more people stuffed into the theatres. I believe this movie would have definitely found an audience if they would have put it up a notch to an R level and given the movie more backbone. The average 13 year old will get a few scares, but what about the rest of us that want to enjoy the other 84 minutes of the movie? The movie certainly feels like a super-extended version of a preview. By the time it gets down to business, it's not that interesting anymore. You find yourself looking for the remote to fast-forward for the good part that just seems to never come.It may not be as bad as other thriller movies out there, but unless you really, really enjoy the genre, you might want to skip this one.If you're reading this review wondering if you should watch it, I suggest Darkness instead (aka The Dark) with Anna Paquin.

Now usually this genre and these types of films never work. However by keeping the original director of the film this film works. Based on the premise of restless spirits and curses this could have easily turned into a cheesy or over the top horror film. However due to surprises and sounds that are not common for American moviegoers it works. What also helps is that the way the story is laid out in fragment and the audience has to put the pieces together. It is not in a linear fashion. The acting was really good on all accounts with genuine performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Plenty of disturbing images and scares thrown in. The DVD contains several extras and previews.

212,ryshpr,Chilling.,6,19 March 2010,"In the crowd of j-horror remakes, for me The Grudge is one that really stands out. In short, it's actually scary. Unlike The Ring it doesn't drag on and just concentrates on actually giving you shivers and scaring you. The Grudge is one film that can genuinely still creep me out and I really don't know why.The theatrical film was cut by around five minutes to achieve a lower rating for the American release, removing several scenes of extreme gore and violence. The Director's Cut version in the UK, however, has the same rating. The new cut vastly improves the viewing quality though.Although the story is a little shaky and sometimes difficult to follow, the scares more than make up for that though. With the cuts, it's a pretty average horror, but without the cuts it's an absolutely brilliant horror movie. It has a perfect balance of suspense, scares and gore. Oh, and Sarah Michelle Gellar.It's pointless explaining the plot of The Grudge because even I'm not sure of it. All I know is that it's about a curse, and a few scary, pasty spirits. The story doesn't follow a chronological time scale which can get puzzling and difficult to follow, but you start to piece together the story as it progresses.It really is no classic, but it's a great movie to watch when you want to be scared silly with a few friends.http://ukmore.tk/",The Grudge

214,camachoborracho,The Drudge,3,23 October 2004,"SPOILER ALERTBefore beginning I'll admit that I did not want to see this film but was dragged to it so I myself had a grudge against it and thus am not totally impartial on seeing it. Still, I should have guessed from the previews and word of mouth that this was going to suck.The story does not make any sense in that those who enter the house die. If this is true, what about the real estate guy? The detective's assistant and the other cops there doing forensic evidence? Also I had a problem with the fact that NOBODY TURNS ON THE LIGHTS! Although I have not yet seen feardotcom (which is supposed to be god-awful) from what I have heard this film parallels it in that these characters also neglect to turn on the lights.But these are minor: the main problems are the story and editing. It was very confusing with the rapid cuts and jumping around of narrative - I understood everything that happened at the end, but I had to do too much piecework to make it make sense, and there are still huge loopholes. Worse, this really detracts from the characters in that you don't care about them since we see them so briefly and then they appear quickly and die - they just seemed like fodder for the house and didn't really have any personal life, goals, meaningful relationships, etc. And if you're going to have a haunted house, make it look scary not sterile and cold and boring like this one.This may also explain why I couldn't find it scary because the cuts happened so often that you didn't a chance to buildup the anticipation - not to mention the transitions themselves (i.e. constant dips to black at the end of every scene) were overused and at strange points. To top it off, the film goes through a checklist of horror clichés (girl in shower, people sticking parts into dangerous places despite knowing something is wrong, hearing scary noises and heading towards them are just a few). Lastly the overused sound ""jumps"" where a scary noise is put in was distracting and the kid who meows like a cat was just plain hilarious though I don't think this was the intent. And for the ending, well, if you couldn't see that coming (or any of the ""scares"") a mile away I have some swampland in Florida I'd like to sell you.There were some good things about it in that the sound and music edits were great and so was the lighting (when it chose to make a cameo). The acting wasn't bad but the script didn't require much more than delivering lines or breathing hard to indicate fear. Also, the remake/adaptation doesn't much matter it took place in Japan and seems like a lot more could have been done. And why did nobody else in the area know of the multiple deaths in the house? Don't try to make sense of this movie, in fact, ignore it altogether and rent something else.FINAL VERDICT: IGNORE */***** (1/5)",The Grudge

The big let down is that they cut the best segment of the original movie and just elongated what was left to fill the 90 mins. The original film relied more upon building a tension of fear and a feeling that you can't escape the curse no matter what. This remake tried to make too much of a story out of it and as is often the case scares were second to the plot having to fit together exactly.I have to say this is not a bad movie, so if you haven't seen the original and can't be doing with subtitles then you'll enjoy this.

It seemed that their processes of death are much more terrifying than that of the creepy boy and his spooky mom. By the same rule defined in this picture, they would have become even more atrocious species of ghosts seeking revenge from the Saekis!!Perhaps this is what's going to happen in Grudge 2 which I haven't seen, but I doubted. Or perhaps Grudge 2 will have a better explanation on the ""Constitution ""of the Ghost Kingdom and how the ""legislation"" on the ""right on scaring others"" were formed.

The concept of a physical place being haunted because of the emotions generated by a person or things' death is not new. Many ghost researchers think that hauntings might be explained in part because shards of emotions get physically recorded in a place, like sound on magnetic tape, and then the haunting occurs when you ""play back"" the emotions, usually by remodeling the house. So to me, ""The Grudge"" has a high believability rating.Throughout the entire movie is a feeling of dread and fear. It never lets up. In fact, it becomes quite tiring by the end of the movie. The ending however, is very flawed and predictable. The musical score also gives away each little fright.

Its scary, sometimes you jump (especially if you own a surround system) and the story about a curse, that remains in the house where the crime happened, haunting everybody who's getting in touch with it, is just great. There is no escape...I love this movie for what it is: a spooky little nightmare with no way out and some great scares. I had to get used though, to Gellars acting, but altogether she did the job not that bad...Its a good thing to remake Japanese classics for the western screens.

222,LAKERS34,Stylish Cheez that's Ultimately Unsatisfying,5,8 March 2005,"While good looking and with some familiar faces, the story ultimately falls flat. We are left to sift through what starts out as a fairly simple plot to try and explain the many holes and seemingly unanswered questions that pop up when all is done...The Japanese homicide detective explains to our heroine something to the effect of: ""There are those who believe when a person departs this world under terrible circumstances, an evil spirit remains which can wreak death and despair on those who disturb it"" (That doesn't sound like a belief that is exclusive only to Japanese culture does it?) - In this case, a home in which a murder/suicide claims a small family due to the wife's desire for another man provides the platform for the evil spirit and the unknowing folks who come in contact with the abandoned home are its sympathetic victims. Our heroine (Gellar) comes into contact with the situation accidentally, but based on what she experiences, should rapidly meet the same fate as the other victims. It seems that since she is the lead, however, she somehow manages to escape the inevitable, at least until the clichéd ending. Other questions about the spirit's manifestations arose and we wondered ""Which family member is doing the killing or are all of them at one time or another?...How did the Pullman character really die? Why does Gellar seemingly escape death (at least until the end?)?...Why do the evil spirits follow victims around the city and not just at the primary house?"" These questions could be simply explained but are not...Even though the film is just over 90 minutes, it's attempts to build tension bog down and it seems to drag on... When the payoffs come and our victims meet their fates, things speed up and we are given quick-cut glimpses of the action; Due to the film's PG-13 rating though, these sequences leave more than a little to be desired...Sure, the evil spirit manifests itself through scary, zombie-like creatures and springs viciously and quickly, but the payoffs leave us more curious than scared (""What did we just see there?"" instead of ""OHHHMYGAAWWD!!!""). The best horror films have R-ratings and leave a tad less to the imagination.The performances in the film are understated and not too bad considering what is there to work with. Gellar is believable as the Student-nurse who stumbles into the nightmare and tries to find some type of explanation for what is happening...One exception: The little boy who played the ghost of the murdered son REALLY got on my wife's and my nerves...every time he popped into a scene, we both snickered and made Mystery Science Theater 3000-type comments. I'm sure the producers of the film were not trying for that effect...To sum up, the story is simple, yet irritating questions remain.

There are maybe 2 parts that are actually creepy, and the rest leaves you thinking, ""...okay... so where's the scary part come in?"" This is a typical new age pg-13 horror movie. A bit of mediocre special effects, a few images the writers thought were creepy, a tortured soul or two, a creepy ghost-child, and a ghost that has a habit of making weird noises and, coincidentally, looking exactly like the girl from The Ring. Long black hair, pale, deteriorating skin, and an unexplained lust for vengeance...or something? Oh, and let's not forget the coincidence of, ""Once you {spoiler edited by myself}, you're gonna die real soon!"" and ""Once you watch this video tape, you have 7 days to live!""? Yep, same boring crap, same boring scare tactics that don't work, same creepy music, typical lame ending that leaves it open for a sequel.It tries to be creepy, it tries to be the same overdone Japanese ghost suspense story, but it's just bad, that's all there is to it. Oh no, a face in the window! A creepy ghost woman on camera! Okay, what does it lead to? A big let down.Just watch The Ring if you want a decent American remake of a Japanese horror movie. But whatever you do, don't watch the sequel to that one.*SPOILER AFTER THIS POINT* One thing that really bothered me. The girl who somehow got her jaw ripped off. It was pretty scary and pretty gross when they showed her wandering around the lobby, and then another character goes over to her to help. Suddenly, we hear from another character...oh, they're dead now. What the hell? Just terrible writing.",The Grudge
224,Kazombie,Pretty creepy,9,26 November 2004,"I've been an avid fan of horror movies for the past 24 years of my life and when I read the negative reviews on IMDb about The Grudge, I was quiet shocked. I don't really know what these people consider creepy or scary. Not every ""scary movie"" needs to have a lunatic with a hooked hand running around ""slashing"" teenagers on a dark stormy night. Haven't we seen enough of those already? I saw The Grudge on DVD last night and It actually made me a bit uneasy, which normally does not happen. If you are looking for a lot of unnecessary blood and stupid teenagers running around, then this movie is definitely not for you. Its quiet a creepy movie and I'm glad that Hollywood is now actually exploring the actual theme of the word ""horror"" around the world for better ideas. I would highly recommend this movie to people who liked the likes of ""the changelling"". All in all, in my opinion, The Grudge is a very good horror film.",The Grudge

This film was very scary, due to the fact that is full of horror scenes, where one can feel the fear a lot better than in the average horror movie...The cast i found did the job wonderfully...Sarah Michelle Gellar played her role in an excellent way...I gave this movie 10/10 because usually nowadays, one can't see a lot of smart good written horror movies, most being superficial ones.",The Grudge

Especially when the young helper Yoko has no jaw.Very thought out and well explained and a ending perfect for the setup for a sequel which all of The Grudge fans knows that it is coming soon. And I am very much looking forward to seeing the sequel.At first I was most definitely scared out of my wits especially when Yoko first goes into the attic, i nearly fell out of my seat so did my friend and he's seen it so many times. Thats how scary this movie is! I was even more scared since all of my friends say it is so scary that they had to sleep with 3 lights on in fear of the Grudge coming and sucking them into one's bed.But not me it scared me of course but it did not scare that much so I had trouble sleeping, I slept perfectly fine that night, plus me and my friend like to make fun of movies so thats what helped me get over the fact that it was horribly scary.I laughed at the very beginning when Peter falls and kills himself. To some people that is not funny but my sense of humor is very different then a lot of people.The graphics in this movie are very well done, especially when Yoko had no jaw I thought that looked very real and scary.I also wonder how much make-up they would have to put on the Grudge to make her look that scary, and the noises she makes really creeps me out. Also when the detectives find Yoko's jaw in in the attic, I thought the jaw looked very scary and real.",The Grudge

It is a brilliant film! Of course, it is a little strange, but totally it is entertained, no boredom at all and it's perfect to spend a short while. There are the necessary scares, some unnecessary, but also unexpected ones. That Asian touch gives the somewhat special film, something really spectacular that occurs to the terror films. At the outset, is a bit rare, because also there are things that do not fit, but while the film is passing, it is understood everything. The film is enjoyed more and more time and time again while it is seen. And it has a mystery of which it give account immediately you, a mystery that makes shine to the film. I'm sure this film will like to a lot of young people, if they animate themselves to see it.

229,mrgray83,Japanese Horror meets Memento.,6,5 May 2005,"The Grudge is a story about how a house holds on to the murders of it's past and manifests them in the murdered soul of a cat, a little boy, and a young girl. The acting was pretty good. The script is where the problems are. There are numerous flashbacks to explain scenes that we've just witnessed. You have to pay close attention to the flashbacks or you'll get lost in things in quite a hurry because a lot is going on. The Grudge has a feel about it that suggests that it's really nothing but an attempt, albeit a pretty decent attempt, to cash in on the fame of The Ring, ie cash in on the idea of remaking Japanese horror films. At the end there's some allusion to a sequel that to me seemed ludicrous and clichéd. The jolt scares in the film were average as well. The monster jumps up suddenly and there's a loud echoing crash heard on the soundtrack. Pretty standard stuff. Nothing to write home about. The CGI and the cinematography were great.6/10 I'd recommend it if you're just a die hard horror fan. I'm a fan of horror but I prefer the psychological stuff.",The Grudge
230,three_am,An excellent Japanese ghost story told for the American audience,10,28 October 2004,"**CONTAINS SPOILERS** The Grudge is an excellent Japanese story told in American format. I loved the simplicity of the story and the out-of-order sequence in which the story unfolds.Although the plot was thin, which is what some of the reviewers have said, I don't think it needed to be to be spooky. Its simple - vengeful ghosts haunt and torment those that visit their place of death. Its your common ""haunted house"" story, yet in a way it isn't because it is another culture's interpretation of what it means to step into a haunted house. Despite all the hype of Japanese horror movies, the culture alone has many spooky supernatural tales. The freakiest ghost in the Japanese culture that I ever heard of is the ""faceless ghost,"" who is portrayed as a woman with no face and only has long shiny black hair that disguises the fact that she is faceless. The faceless ghost scares anyone coming upon her into shock. But, I digress from my review of the Grudge.Even though I agree with everyone saying how the thrills and scares were common effects also found in many other horror movies, I thought this movie used it very well in terms of storytelling. I think the most eeriest supernatural stories are the short, mysterious ghost stories like the Vanishing Hitchhiker. The Grudge is like this. The freakiest part of the movie was when the ghost followed the sister Susan to her work building and tormented her there and then followed her home. Anyone who grew up in Hawaii listening to ""obake"" (ghost) stories will understand why this scene was so ""chicken skin""(goosebumps) - its because it reminded me of Hawaii's supernatural tales where the ghosts follow you. I think if you're already a highly superstitious person (like I am) then this movie will genuinely freak and creep you out. I am still left with spooky images of this movie. This is one movie not to miss! I give it 5/5 stars.",The Grudge
231,boo_4ever,Some people seem to have a grudge,9,3 April 2005,"Against this film. I liked it. The reason why is because it succeeded as a horror film in that it really creeped me out in certain parts. That hasn't happened to me in a while.Maybe its because I have a weakness for freaky looking Japanese girls and little kids in general. You can tell children are evil, you never know what they're thinking. Scenes in the Grudge creeped me out no matter how many times I watched them and I pride myself on being immune to scares nowadays. Many have complained the already slim plot meanders all over the place to the extent the film becomes too disjointed and hard to follow. I didn't find that myself. It was a simple story and was told very well and very effectively.The story being that a house in which a double murder and a suicide took place now carries a curse which is fatal to all who come across it. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar who has been weaned of the stakes and has taken up nursing when she moves to Japan to be with her boyfriend. Her first assignment is to take care of an old lady living in the cursed house. The rest is film history.Because there is very little plot and back story the film relies on its set pieces to deliver. And thankfully they do. Shiver as you hear the choked gargling sound of the mother ghost, squirm at the high pitched cat meowing of the little boy, laugh as a stupid blonde American woman tries to hide from the ghost IN HER BED. That bit was brilliant.One for scary movie fans who just want to be scared plain and simple. Just don't watch while in bed. You'll know what I mean.",The Grudge

Of course, my comments are probably irrelevant since I am not attracted to horror films. I realize the director also wrote and directed the original version in Japanese. I am not impressed. John Carpenter's ""Halloween""...now, THERE was a horror flick that had legs.The acting was awful; the main character (the nurse)is insipid and has about three facial expressions: smiling, bewildered, aghast. The scary faces are pretty good, and the bodies are artfully rendered. However, the tension was lackluster. The explanation is idiotic. The inconclusive ending is just stupid.

When ""The Ring"" came along, I though it was great, atmospherically scary and one to remember. I thought ""Samara, you are a scary little specter, but I would still rather encounter 10 of you than one Linda Blair"".Then, two nights ago, I watched ""The Grudge"" expecting to be mildly entertained and borderline scared. WRONG! It really is a horror movie and guess what - it comes through on many levels. I can honestly say that Linda Blair has met her match with some of the most horrible visages, I have ever seen in a film. I guess Linda Blair will now have company in my nightmares. Only hope ""Tubular Bells"" isn't playing in the background because then I will surely have a heart attack.If you really, really like to be scared this is one terrific fright fest.",The Grudge
234,meako1973,A letdown,6,2 November 2004,"Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in this, the fifth time the Ju-On tale has been told, with the original writer/director crafting his spooky tale for a western audience. The film introduces us to a house where something happened, causing spirits to haunt it. Anyone who enters the house will soon die, as the curse gets to them. SMG plays a student social care worker who is assigned to look after an old lady in the house. Creepy, atmospheric, chilling, and excellent use of camera-work and sound....that was the Japanese version which was out earlier this year. This remake unfortunately lets itself down by using the Hollywood conventions of building music to let us know something is going to happen, blaring noise to make us jump (why, I don't know), and tricky/jumpy camera-work to add a disturbing edge to the film...thus dampening the overall effect.The camera-work is the biggest problem. One brilliant scene in the original, of the female spirit crawling down the stairs showed the full journey step by step. Here, we see her at the top, a quick glimpse at the middle, then she is at the bottom (whilst rising music tells us we should be scared). The scene loses the whole effect in making it so quick. It isn't a total failure. Like The Ring, it is better than most of the usual garbage Hollywood churns out these days, and is a reasonable translation of the story. It's just that once again the essence of what makes Ju-On so chilling has gone. This is even more distressing when you remember the original creator was in charge. WHy did he change his vision so much? Why did he decide to go conventional Hollywood? Above average, but a letdown at the same time. Go watch the original instead.",The Grudge
235,ennieday09,An overrated horror film with too much hype and a predictable outcome,6,4 June 2009,"I watched this movie a long time ago but decided to do a review when my friend kept going on and on about how she is still scared to death by this movie years after she saw it. I feel i need to express my opinion on this much hyped horror movie.The Grudge is proclaimed as one of the *scariest* movies of our generation when really it gets into the mind of the audience that it is scarier than it presents itself to be. When i first saw the trailer for this when the hand came out of Sarah Michelle Gellar's head in the shower i admit i thought this was going to be a scary as hell horror movie. But what i got was a movie with many and i mean MANY moments that leave you on the edge of your seat and exactly what you expected to happen, well happens.My complaints of this movie was that there were too many moments where you hear a noise or think you see something and the character turns her head and nothing is there. Or when a scary moment happens and it cuts straight to the next scene without explanation of what happened to that character. For example, very first scene of the movie where the girl goes into the attic with the candle (Oh yeah like she goes into a dark attic with nothing but a candle, there definitely isn't anything there that is about to pop out) but what do you know...something does!! and its the grudge girl person. Well being the first scene of the movie i thought it was kinda scary and cool as a warm up of things to come. But the repetitiveness was almost boring in a way i couldn't keep my attention to the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellars character walking around Tokyo for 2 hours trying to find the history of the house and everything gave me a headache. The random scenes where the grudge girl were to pop out randomly and give the audience the short *scare* factor was annoying and random scenes where the victims of the house get killed off were never explained and leave you wondering OK? what just happened? The Grudge is an overrated horror movie with some original material but should never by any means be considered one of the greatest horror films of all time. Watch this movie to get a quick scare and then forget about it maybe 2 weeks later. I give it a 6/10 for effort",The Grudge
236,jryan-4,Can't miss concept (Mild spoiler included),6,17 February 2005,"Hey, I've got a great idea. Let's make a combination Amityville Horror/Lost in Translation/The Ring flick. Let's get a trendy American actress with a cult following to be the nominal star of this concoction. She can represent the American abroad point of view. Let's get Gellar. After Scooby Doo, she's got to be desperate to do something to reclaim her artistic credibility. She's still got the Buffy cult members who will show up to anything. We can even throw in a Janet Leigh type early offing of a seeming minor star only this time let's make it a male. I got it Bill Pullman. He's perfect. Either that or we could move a bunch of Japanese folks into the Amityville house and have them go through the culture shock. Think how great that would go over in Japan. If it becomes a hit in Japan we could hire the same director and remake it over here. No, forget that concept, let's go with the first one, the one with Gellar and Pullman. We'll make it incoherent but we'll have a lot of pop up scares one of which we'll make a real jaw dropper. Yeah, that's the ticket. The critics will hate it. So what, it'll make money.

237,Samualt,So bad it is funny!,3,24 October 2004,"Even Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't make this pig fly. Director Takashi Shimizu does a remake of his own bad Japanese film and produces an American version that is just as bad. Perhaps the Japanese are more easily entertained.I like Sarah Michelle Gellar (aka Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as an actress very much, but her choice in movie scripts is getting pretty poor. Even Buffy couldn't make this film any better no matter how well she acted. Bill Pullman, Clea DuVall, and the beautiful KaDee Strickland are also good actors but the script just gives them nothing to work with. I certainly can't fault casting or the acting here. It is just a terrible, somewhat juvenile, script and all the star power in the world couldn't have fixed that.The direction and cinematography wasn't bad. The camera was always in focus, the segues were nicely done, and everything seemed to be in frame when it was supposed to be. However, the special effects weren't scary at all. In fact, they were a little silly. The only thing that will have you jumping out of your seat is the loud sounds whenever an event of some kind takes place. It is just more annoying than anything else. What made this movie so bad was the stupid premise and even dumber script. It is truly the ""Dumb and Dumber"" of horror movies. The premise is that when a person dies in a rage that the place where they died is then haunted. If that were true then one out of every twenty homes in America would be unlivable. It is just a silly and untenable premise. I also couldn't believe some of the ignorant things the characters did and said in this movie. It was so bad it was funny! People in the theater were actually laughing.Perhaps this is what happens when we outsource our horror movies to Japan. I'll take a good old copy of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" over these foreign films any day. Seriously, foreign writers and directors are just too mild and timid for American tastes. They are going to have to do a heck of a lot more then yell ""Boo"" to scare us! I hope this trash isn't an omen for the rest of the October movie season. Where is George A. Romero, Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, and John Carpenter when you need them!Rating: 3/10. Don't waste your time or money. Too bad, I had such great hopes.",The Grudge

240,Caustic Pulp,Ju-on's Greatest Hits,6,24 October 2004,"I want desperately to like this film. I enjoyed most of its running time. I can forgive the execrable ending for the quality scares that preceded it.But this film has a problem, and it is exactly the same problem that plagues Ju-on: The Grudge. Essentially, if you haven't seen the original Ju-on and Ju-on 2, you'll be completely lost. The problem here is that if you haven't see Ju-on: The Grudge either, you'll be completely lost.If you can latch on to the scares, though, you're in for a treat. Mostly.The problem is that this is as much a remake of Ju-on as Ju-on: The Grudge, but when the screenwriter put his hands together, he wrecked the whole thing. I can say with certainty that the achilles' heel of the movie is the script and unfortunately, that was the weak point of the original films. That it's compounded here brings the film dangerously close to being outright bad.The direction saves it. The acting does not, but I'll give Takashi Shimizu leeway there too. The man does good work, and Japanese horror nuts will thrill to see Ryo Ishibashi (Audition, Suicide Circle) here.If you have any interest at all in the original films, do not watch this movie until you've seen them. This movie will spoil the best scenes of the original low budget films. You can buy them on eBay; I got all four original films for $50 there with quality English subtitles.Otherwise, it's a good, solidly scary film. But it will ruin the other films and is probably the first remake I've seen that actively damages the existing films. Approach with caution.",The Grudge

I've got an idea for a double sequel that'll knock the socks off of all them big shots in Hollywood (or is it Tokyo? I just can't tell any more). A guy, we'll call him Sam Michael Gillman, hears from his friend in Japan that he needs a house sitter to watch his place for a week. Well, Sam has never been to Japan so he figures this will be a good opportunity to go there on the cheap. Before he boards the plane he figures he should pick up some English language videos to watch while he's there. He gets to Japan and he has a taxi take him to his friend's house, only he mispronounces the name of the street and the taxi driver takes him to The Grudge death house by mistake. Oh my!!! Sam goes in the house. Fortunately for him, even though there was actually no one LIVING in the house at the time, the electricity and phone still work. So, Sam makes himself comfortable and puts one of his videos into the VCR. It's a strange video with a girl in a well and a spooky glowing ring. When it's over the phone rings and he's told he would normally have 7 days to live but in this case death happens to be on holiday in Japan, so she's coming right over. In the meantime, there is a noise that seems to be coming from the attic. Sam thinks all this is very odd. He looks up on the stairs and there is a black cat, a little Asian boy, a young somber Asian lady, and this really angry fellow. He's trying to make out what they want. He is strangely compelled to pick up the cat, help the little boy, and then go up and join them in the attic. Whatever it is they want, they are alternating from looking like just regular folks to appearing as horribly scary ghost people! Sam is intrigued and is thinking this must all be quite normal in Japan, when there is a knock at the television. Suddenly, and without warning, on this dark and stormy night, the girl that was in the video crawls through the television and walks slowly toward Sam. ""Are these friends of yours?"", Sam asks the TV ghoul, pointing to the stairs. All the odd dead people look at each other and try in vain to communicate with froggy croaking sounds.

In this case, the producers of _The Grudge_ apparently decided that many American faces would make the product many times more successful. I just didn't work. If they were that insistent on a large American cast, I think the producers would have had a far better product had they remade the film in America. After all, it worked for _The Ring_.If you can get past that major credibility issue, _The Grudge_ is a pretty good tale. It weaves together the better segments of the tele-play and theatrical versions of _Juon_, a spooky Japanese tale about a murder in the past and all the subsequent people who were connected with the place where it happened.

It wasn't as creepy as the trailer made it look but it still had a few good scares. Sarah Michelle Gellar is always good and the rest of the cast includes Kadee Strictland, Bill Pullman, and others. There were a few cheap scares but the realistic scares made up for it. Kadee Strictland has a good scene in which she is terrorized by the grudge.I, unlike most of the nations critics, liked her in ""Anacondas"". Bill Pullman is a waste in an unnedded role. A lot of scenes include flashbacks with not much purpose.The one major thing that made me give this less that ***1/2 was the ending, if you could even call it an ending. It doesn't even end. It has no explanation and tells nothing about its after events. It's almost like the writers fell asleep while writing it and then forgot to add an ending.Overall: Despite confusing flashbacks and some cheap scares, ""The Grudge"" does make you jump plenty of times and has an interesting plot, a good cast, and some good scenery.The Grudge; ***PG-13; disturbing images of violence and some sensuality.",The Grudge

The original 'Ring' films and 'Dark Water' where amazing and I was shocked and disappointed at the American remakes. The remakes of those films were f**king dreadful. On the whole remakes of anything are bad, and when a film is being remade scene for scene just in a different language it is beyond pointless. Why can't people watch the film in it's original language for God's sake? It's probably got something to do with the rising levels of illiteracy... and that's why I was so disappointed in myself when I watched this film all the way through and realised it was itself a remake! But wow! What a film it was! Great acting, a great cast - I even liked the annoying Sarah Michelle Gellar - and executed perfectly. The bringing together of East and West was beautiful.I pity the other reviewers on here that say it isn't scary. If this film doesn't scare you nothing will.

Another thing I really want to compliment the creative team on is their ability to have made each of the grudge's appearances more horrific then the previous one. I really like the corridor shot in the grudge 2 where it is making it's way towards Sarah who by the way I think is beautiful. I give the entire trilogy a 9 due to the fact that almost every hot girl get's killed in these films. I hated how Sarah falls off the roof in the 2nd film but you gotta put some kind of shock moment there for your audience. All round I really like these films and the stories that they told.",The Grudge
249,Moonhawk1975,Well-made and creepy ghost story,9,10 April 2005,"Haunted house movies are an interesting sub-genre. I love horror films and I love ghost stories, but as a movie they tend to leave something to be desired. Usually they are over-produced disappointments (like the remake of ""The Haunting"") or they tend to leave too much to the imagination and are a little slow (like ""The Amityville Horror""). This film manages to succeed as entertaining, a little chilling and fast-paced.In Japan, Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a nurse who is given the assignment of looking after another American (Grace Zabriskie). The previous caretaker did not report to work; after the opening we know why. We soon discover the house is haunted by an extremely nasty ghost. Even worse, it is cursed: those who enter will be haunted to their deaths by the ghosts who met a grisly end inside.I think what helps the movie along the most is the way the story is told. After an opening that is shocking only because of the name actor involved (we don't yet know enough about the character to have any emotional connection), the movie cuts to another person at the house, then backwards to someone else, forward to someone we have met before, sideways to another person, backwards again and then forward some more. It would be very confusing if you were not to pay attention to what is happening. Those who are not entertained by this and let their minds wander will wind up disliking this tremendously.The acting is good for a horror feature. Gellar is right in her element here, showing a more vulnerable side to herself than she did as Buffy. Bill Pullman acts haunted even before he actually is; I liked his character and wished they had done more with him. I especially like Clea DuVall. An unconventional looking actress, she is very good in every feature I have seen her in.There are scares to be found, most notably from the spirit who likes to noisily crawl up and down staircases, slapping her hands on the steps and making a creepy clicking sound. A little too much is left unexplained (like what happened to all the police who show up at the house at one point; how does the curse effect them and when), but it is not enough to ruin a good fright flick.",The Grudge
250,xenolupa,"Not so bad, rather good",7,17 January 2005,"I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at IMDb. I worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I don't consider this a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko.The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the Japanese original).The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice.The movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because it is very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that gather Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave it a 7.",The Grudge

First, the movie starts off well by having a guy takes a dive off his high-rise apartment building. From there it builds the suspense and the creepiness petty well. The jump-cut of the scenes are less confusing than the Japanese's version, I think the audience were able to follow the story line. The first half of the movie exceeds my low expectation of the remake due to all of the bad reviews that I have read. I thought this movie is not so bad after all. But half way through the movie somehow it seems that movie starts to run out of the steam and the whole film starts to slow down greatly. The scares just doesn't seem that scary any more from the first half of the movie and I could sense restlessness amongst the audience. It seems that the director has run out of ideas on how to scare us and the film just slowly marches toward the end. Now I am not a big fan of the FX in horror movies, but I believe the producer of this movie sticks too much to the old school of horror films. I think that a little special effects would greatly help in terms of scarieness of the ghosts.",The Grudge

Phony bologna yes, but the film is creepy and scary.The characters are all likable so it is creepier to see people you like to die. Very suspenseful and spooky. Good score too.The acting is A++++ from Sarah Michelle Gellar but some of the other actors need some work. There are some cheesy lines like, ""Yoko, are you OK?"" when she is covered with blood.

256,IPreferEvidence,Unnecessary but not the worst thing ever,6,19 April 2011,Its not terrible but its totally pointless. Its just like The Omen(2006) a shot by shot remake of the original. I personally liked the original 呪怨 (Ju-on: The Curse) more than 呪怨 (Ju-on: The Grudge) because of the lo-fi look and atmosphere so this was even less likely to satisfy me and since 呪怨 (Ju-on: The Grudge) was already a sort of remake of 呪怨 (Ju-on: The Curse) that makes this a remake of a remake...(sigh). Basically every thing in this movie was either as good or worse than in the original(nothing was improved) and every thing that was good was basically copied from the original.If you haven't seen the original Ju-On:The Curse or Ju-On:The Grudge go watch them rather than this but if you've already seen all other Ju-On movies and want more I suppose this ain't that bad.

Apparently, these Japanese horror films don't translate well to English, because the entire plot of this one was just stupid. For starters, the whole concept is that 'if a person dies in a fit of great rage, then a curse is born', but the ghosts weren't in rage when they died. The guy who killed them was. Secondly, there was no reason for the great rage. The husband finds out that his wife has the hots for this professor... so what? Happens every day, and 'grudges' aren't born from them. You keep waiting for some kind of payoff, but it never comes. There were some good creepy scenes, like the creaking noise that kept coming from the mother, and the reflection on the bus, but all in all, it was just a disappointing movie and a lame ghost story (coming from a guy who LOVES ghost stories!)..3/10",The Grudge

260,rvnc,Really poor,1,11 June 2008,"Okay i'm not a big fan of Japanese horror, although i have seen the original version of The Ring and thought it was OK, but this really is a bad movie on all levels.First, the characterisation is awful. We learn nothing about each character except a very brief overview before they get killed off. As a way of creating pathos for the victims it's not ideal.Second, it's very annoying. None of the characters put up a fight when they get killed, either cowering in fear or standing stock still as their doom very slowly approaches in the form of s small child or woman screaming at them.Third, it's not very scary. There's the standard 'OMG, it's right behind her' and the mirror reflection shot, but other than that it relies upon the aforementioned sinister child and woman to chill our spines. Whilst their stilted movements might be kinda creepy on the first few occasions, by the time half a dozen hapless individuals have met their demise in this manner, it's become very dull indeed.Fourth, it makes the error of adding that mind-numbingly stupid end sequence in which the villain of the piece appears unscathed at the end of the piece, ready to strike the heroine down, thus rendering the entire last twenty minutes, and indeed the film utterly pointless. This is a modern film-making trend in the horror/thriller genre, and it should not be encourage Worst of all though is the fatalism of it all. So everyone who enters the house dies and there's nothing that can be done to stop it. Why would we want to watch a film like that? One after one characters are killed of for no other reason than that they once entered a house, and there's nothing that can save them. Talk about depressing.As such this renders 'The Grudge' completely unwatchable. Not even the divine Sarah Michelle Gellar can make it anymore enjoyable, truly terrible. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid or read a book instead.",The Grudge

262,Rack-Focus,THE SIXTH SENSE MEETS LOST IN TRANSLATION,6,22 October 2004,"THE GUDGE is a decent horror flick that could have been better without the split personality. It's based on the Japanese film Ju-on: The Grudge (2003). In the American version, the filmmakers apparently took the easy way out and stapled Lost in Translation (2003) to the front of the script.PART 1: LOST IN TRANSLATION: As a result, the first third of the movie mirrors Lost in Translation's frozen inaction and snail's pace. It's so boring I almost walked out and serves no purpose except to awkwardly splice Caucasians into an Asian movie.These elements also kill plot development. Dialogue is minimized because much of the early talking is subtitled Japanese. As a result we learn very little about the characters and develop few feelings for them. Most are bland anyway. One is an even accountant! The location is similarly wasted. Any local color that could explain why the movie should take place in Japan is abandoned in favor of generic city shots.PART II: SIXTH SENSE: But once The Grudge shifts in The Sixth Sense (1999) mode, things improve rapidly. The movie mimics the Sixth Sense's style of shadows and quick cuts of the horror to keep us scared and guessing when the next fright will strike. And the movie does deliver the chills.So if you're willing to put up with a very slow start, The Grudge will take you to a fine frightful finish.",The Grudge
263,party pat,Kinda like the Ring except lamer,3,7 September 2005,"I'm not a big fan of the suspense thriller horror movie. I much prefer the blood and guts thrasher style horror. There are a few exceptions though when done right, this was not one of them. Imagine the Ring, but gayer and in Japan. It has the similar special effects and even the ""zombies(?)"" look very similar. This movie however does not have nearly as good of a plot or script. They try to make it more interesting with the flash backs but it was just confusing as to what was going on and why. Then it all came together at the end and it was lame. The girl going down the steps at the end was very reminiscent of the scene from the Exorcist, except the Exercist scene didn't suck and was totally creepy. The only thing this movie had going for it was Ted Raimi, that dude rules, and he had hardly any screen time. Would not recommend this unless you are into totally unoriginal suspense thrillers that suck, then you would probably love this.",The Grudge
264,mw_director,"A mixed bag, with bits both better and worse than Ju-on. (6/10)",6,22 October 2004,"Takashi Shimizu must be getting tired of Toshio and the grudge by now. This is his fifth film on the subject, and the first English-language one. Taking scenes from the 2000 direct-to- video ""Ju-on"" and the 2003 theatrical version (the first and third films of the whole series), it recasts the story with American actors in most of the roles. I thought that this movie might do more with the culture-clash aspects of this casting choice, but it didn't, preferring to stick pretty closely to the original premise. As a result there's no logical narrative reason for this movie to be full of Americans, other than that it makes the movie easier to sell in America.Sarah Michelle Gellar does a pretty good job in the role played by Megumi Okina in the 2003 film. She plays Karen, an American exchange student in Japan who moonlights as a caregiver to invalids for extra credit. The most admirable aspect of her performance is that she makes Karen an original character and isn't always reminding you of Buffy the whole time. (Particularly as Buffy would respond to these ghosts with a few well-placed roundhouse kicks.) Other performers include Bill Pullman, who's unusually good in the role of the teacher played by Yûrei Yanagi in the 2000 video version. I typically find Pullman a decent but unexceptional actor, but here he does the best job of all the American cast of conveying the despair and hopelessness of being affected by the house's curse. You can see the horror in his eyes and it's totally convincing.The Grudge actually follows the non-linear story structure of the Japanese movies, which surprised me. A lot of scenes are direct remakes of scenes in the earlier films, but while some come across very well and very creepy, others just kind of make you giggle. The scene with the sister hiding under her bedsheets, only to meet the ghost there, just doesn't come off as well with a blonde American actress. Then again, the use of a stairwell instead of a ladies' room in the scene is very good. Some fans of the original have stated they disliked the changes made to the ending in this version, but I thought the ending worked okay. It certainly plays better for an American version than I think Ju-on's ending would. One change about this movie I didn't care for was the way they altered the guttural throat noise that comes from the ghosts. In some scenes it sounds just like the original, and in others, they add so much echo and other digital effects to it, it sounds more like a creaking door or something else entirely.Overall I give The Grudge a 6/10 whereas I'd give Ju-on an 8/10. You really ought to see Ju- on first, unless you're someone who's just allergic to subtitles. Generally I'm not sure how well Americans who aren't already J-Horror fans will take to this, since the kind of horror Americans are used to is Freddy and Jason and all that dead teenager stuff. So most American viewers might find the whole ghostly child thing a little silly. But it's worth a shot as a matinée. And if you've never seen any of this series before, try to grab the original 2000 video version as well as the 2003 movie. In that one, one of the grudge's victims is played by young Chiaki Kuriyama, better known as Go-Go Yubari to ""Kill Bill"" fans.",The Grudge

But I recently returned for another viewing on the Unrated Director's Cut. If you haven't yet seen The Grudge, this is the version you want to see (or at least rent). What's different? SPOILER ALERT Extended scenes: were more graphic scenes: original family murder (poor black cat), jawless Yoko care centre return, and stairway descent.Deleted scenes: quite a few that add more dimension to the film, including a scene of possessed Matt hair-dragging dead Jennifer the same as Takeo/Kayako, Susan's apartment visit.Short Films: Shimizu's early work 4444444444 and In the Corner are decent but looked like audition tests for Ju-On (those ghosts get around).Overall, the original Japanese Ju-On is still the best probably because it was the first time I saw this story and those freaky ghost eyes, but I recommend the Unrated Director's for a viewing.

268,gaeanprayer,What a shame...,7,4 July 2006,"Another movie that's received a bad reputation, and hell if I know why. This remake was quite good, far as I'm concerned.Sarah Michelle Gellar is an American nurse in Tokyo, blah blah, substitutes for someone who goes missing, blah blah...I'm sure you all know what this movie is about by now What you probably don't know, however, is that unlike what most of the critics will say, this movie is filled with suspense. The noises and sound effects are played up extremely well, fitting in and filling the atmosphere of the movie with fear and horror while at the same time being ambient enough to draw little attention away from the screen. While Sarah makes a better Buffy than she does a victim, she still plays her role well, though if it were me I probably would have reacted a little more...extreme...if there were some weird bloody ghost thing in my grill. But whatever.I don't know a lot about the Grudge series (though I intend to rectify that) but I got a vague idea and, having some familiarity with Japanese culture, understand the lore and superstition this movie was developed around. For those complaining none of it makes sense, make a half-assed attempt to research the background for the movie and within a few minutes you'd understand what is going on. Needless to say, the Japanese are a very spiritual and superstitious people, especially the older generation, and that was likely who this movie would most appeal to despite it's American remake.In any case, my toes were literally curling, waiting for something to happen or materialize, and what makes me happy is that it always did. I hate horror movies that build suspense only to end it with something dumb like...oh, it was just a cat O.o silly me...and go on to something else. God that annoys me. The gore factor is fairly low, with the exception of one particular part that was just plain disturbing (the tongue scene, as it is known as) but that wasn't the purpose of the film. The point was to scare its audience, and I was scared, so the job was done.The reason for the title of this critique, however, is the ending. It was horrible. Right up there with some of the worst endings of all time. If there was a better ending and a little more information about the ghost kid, this would have gotten a 9 from me easily. Oh well, still a good movie. If I paid for a theater ticket, I wouldn't be upset.",The Grudge

270,Mystical_lonewolf,this is indeed a great flick,8,18 April 2005,"I can't tel how much this Ju on and the remake Grudge has taught me. I believe that many people who saw this hated it because it's nothing like the old American horror flicks where there's tank size gore and some sick minded scenes involved. But then again, i don't see what many people see in American horrors.I vote for Japanese horrors because they are much scarier. It's not just about Japanese women hiding their faces or some scary music, i think it was really more to how you view it and how realistic it is.1) You don't ever need gore to make good horror flicks, no matter how badly people loves that. 2) Little or no CGI is very good to make horror flicks. It fleshes out realistic images. Too much CGI is very noticeable and hardly scary. 3) You don't need to explain much in the horror film because if you did, it would remove the scare factor. nothing has to be spelled out for you, unless you're a kind of person who has to be explained millions of time. 4) Short episode sequence like in Ju On is very effective and the grudge is bit like that but more blended. I must say for each character to go through such thing we feel their feelings and we see what they see. 5) I believe that it's the viewers you wanted to scare, not the characters. However scaring the characters is good, but better if the viewers feels it. I also think that if we viewers sees something that no character has spotted or could see is very effective. Plus gives more mystery to why this is. 6) For Asian ghost horrors, there is no victory, there is no defeating these ghosts. The point was to scare the viewers, much less just to find a haunted place and solve it, which was done in American horror films or ghostly films that ain't horrors like Ghost or ""Haunted mansion"". 7) Less is more. Less blood is good. You can put it on someone's corner of the eye, give bloodshot eyes, or make it a bloody face. But if it's like raining blood, that's not good. If you want to put gore, make it less gory for it to be effective. otherwise, you're just pleasing the hard core gore fans and grossing the anti gore fans like me.So that is what i've learned from the grudge and it's original film.

I had previously herd that The Grudge was known for its scare factor, but even this was a letdown--all we see and hear is a pair of eyes wildly opened and a sound effect which to me is very similar to Predator (1987.) In conclusion, If you like horror films with a confusing story, no character development or no scare factor there's something wrong with your tastes in movies, however you will love The Grudge.",The Grudge
276,Mason1024,just not that good,4,14 September 2007,"Some feel that Yankees can't say bad things about this movie because it's Japanese. But it's a remake done especially for Yanks, so the cultural argument doesn't hold much water. It doesn't take long to figure out most of what ends up being called the plot. The only scary parts are the cheap tricks to force you into feeling scared... The sudden, strange visual accompanied by a crescendo of music and/or sound effects... In my view there's a wide gulf between the frightening and the startling, and true horror movies focus on the former. Think of The Shining... that's scary in concept and execution. The Grudge just isn't truly frightening, and since it's meant to be a horror film, it therefore just isn't very good.",The Grudge
277,A Jay,I actually enjoyed it,8,27 December 2004,"Yes the plot is thin enough to pass your hand through, but it's still a great film. It's quite scary in a few places I suppose watching it at 2 in the morning didn't help the situation. However even if I hadn't watched it then it still would've scared me. The way that the suspense is built up is chilling, especially with that strange little boy Toshio. When Susan is going home and is travelling up to her apartment in the lift and Toshio is there on every floor, I had my fists up to my face cringing, it really freaked me out. But not as much as the next section did, again involving Susan and the main ghost Kayako. Sad as it may seem I actually had to look under my bed covers when I got home. I know the acting wasn't perfect and in an odd way I was half expecting a vampire to leap out at Karen, but I still got sucked into the whole story of why Kayako was haunting the house in the first place. It had me jumping all over the place a few times and that noise gave me the chills I decided to give it 8/10 because on the whole it is a good film with an interesting premise to a story. It's well directed & still manages to do a better job than other Japanese to American remakes of recent years.",The Grudge
278,rpannier,I've seen both Ju-on and Grudge,4,16 June 2006,"Ju-on is wayyyy better. Ju-on is much more disciplined (as disciplined as it can be with the format of the story). Ju-on avoids much of the cheap shock tactics that are used in Grudge (especially the end). The use of light and shadow are also better in Ju-on. The scene with the Raimi and the dead woman who lost her jaw was just silly and served no purpose in the story except to go for the gross out effect. I was agitated that they cut out the detective and his daughter from the original movie. I'm surprised I disliked the Grudge so much. I mean, they had the same director for both movies. But for a variety of reasons, some I mentioned above, others I left out, the movie just didn't work. Grudge is just lame.",The Grudge
279,stuart-193,Creeeeeeeeepy,8,10 November 2004,"Undeterred by the less than favourable reviews, I decided to go and see The Grudge. As I haven't seen the Japanese version I had no pre-conceptions and, save for the reviews and TV ads, not much idea about the story - was I going to be disappointed? This is one of those movies that critics hate (I'll never understand why that is), but the public at large give the thumbs up to. The Grudge is not your average shocker and not so obvious as to make it tedious despite a relatively simple script. Geller does a fine job of looking scared witless and the monster justifies all the tension the director builds. This is a very creepy movie ... completely undeserving of the slating that it has been given in the press - I give it 8/10 . Well worth a look.",The Grudge

281,Bschorr,Apparently I don't know anything about film,2,30 August 2005,"Just finished watching ""The Grudge"" and unfortunately I didn't find it to be particularly engaging. Perhaps it was the slow pace, or the lack of coherent plot. Unfortunately horror films usually do lose me when people starting pursuing the ghost (or spirit) into dark places alone -- I guess I'm too logical.It was beautifully filmed and the music was a nice addition, but I found myself audibly sighing repeatedly during the movie (luckily I was in my living room). Probably because it seemed like the same scene over and over again.Obviously there are people with a much bigger appreciation for this type of film than I do. If you are somebody who thought the Ring was fabulous then you'll probably like this. If not, you might find this film a little tedious and repetitive.",The Grudge
282,aaronnz,OMG a genuinely scary horror movie at last,9,10 September 2005,"Yes I am male, no I am not a scaredy cat, but could this movie just be a wee bit more scary please? no I don't think it could actually.I sat in bed thinking hoe de hum lets just put this DVD in and get it over and done with, I wasn't expecting much. I used to be a fan of horrors especially 80's horrors the birth of the modern horror film. Though lately it seems that American movie makers have lost the ability to create genuine horrors that scare. This must be why they had to borrow from the original Japanese version of this film and also use the same director/producer also????Even so I have to give Sam Ramai (yet another spelling error) the two thumbs up for improving on the Japanese version and making it even creepier. I don't normally like praising a movie up too much, there's nothing worse than someone saying gee that was a wicked film then you go hire it and think OK that was crap and IMDb reviewers suck. So instead I will just say watch it alone, in bed, at night with the lights out, on a DVD player with a surround sound TV or home theater system. And make sure you have your duvet cover pulled up.If the ultra pale, dead little Japanese kid with the psychotic cat doesn't put the willies up you, then the Japanese woman with the world record for double jointedness surely will.This is the movie that will be known for years to come, as the film that put and end to sales of Duvet covers. I will never think of bed linen the same way ever again!Genuinely scary little number only out done by the Japanese sequel The Grudge 2 (ju-on 2)probably spelt that wrong but you get the idea.I recommend that you watch the U.S version of ""The Grudge"" first then view the Japanese movie ""The Grudge 2"".Guaranteed to give you nightmares and put you in therapy for the next ten years. If you like these movies try getting hold of the string of Asian horrors coming out such as Phone, and Dark Water and The EyeI give this movie a 9 for the fact that it not only put the sh^%%%its up me and made me scared of pale Japanese kids for life. But it also didn't rely on CGI too heavily. Many of the scenes I thought were done with CGI weren't. And however that woman learned to move and twist her body like that I will never know, if you think Michael Jacksons moon walk was cool you have'nt seen nothing yet! you have to see this to believe it.I can't wait to see if Sam Ramai can improve on The Grudge 2 Japanese version, I think he find it a tall order to follow!",The Grudge
283,siektwo,Good for what it is...,8,26 October 2004,"First off, I will tell you all that I'm a hardcore horror film fanatic. I've seen hundreds of horror movies all throughout my 21 years on this Earth. I've seen mainstream horror, indi horror, Italian horror, Spanish horror, big budget and no budget horror, OOP (out of print) horror, etc.One must approach a horror film in a different manner than most movies. First ask yourself, what is the main goal of a horror movie?-to scare you -to entertain you -to creep you out -often times to make you laugh -to make you have a good time...A horror movie is like a roller-coaster. You get ""on board"" pretty much knowing what to expect. You pay a few bucks, take your ride and then toss those memories aside after you get your kicks out of it.Horror films are (for the most part) the roller-coaster ride.Films such as Star Wars, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, and even Requiem For A Dream are to be viewed in a much different light than the horror film.Those above mentioned films stand out because of numerous things. Whether it's the amazing story and imagination that went into Star Wars, the gritty realistic historically accurate war scenes of Saving Private Ryan, or the powerful and gripping acting in Requiem For A Dream. These types of movies are equivalent to taking a vacation at the Six Flags Theme park or Disneyworld. Horror is the cheap quick thrill/entertainment of the roller-coaster. ""Epic"" (in their own ways) type films are the entire family vacation to that exspensive theme park. When you leave, you will remember those events for a long time, and there was just so much to do and see. Horror is not that. Horror is......well, horror.That being said, I must say that The Grudge is a great horror film. What makes me take notice to a ""good"" or ""great"" horror film are the things that make it stand out. Hollywood seems to have lost the grasp on horror over the last 10 years, spitting out ""another teen slasher w/out any smarts"".While those ""slasher"" type horror flicks can be fun, they ultimately leave you disappointed by cardboard stories/characters and instead rely on blood/boobies (that's not a bad thing for some people's opinions).This is what makes the Grudge a great horror flick. The blood/gore is only there for impact on certain scenes. It is there to heighten the intensity and creepiness. There isn't much blood, and only a single gory element (no i won't say what it is)...but that's not the point of THIS type of horror movie. The blood/gore was used tastefully and not overdone, but at the same time, not underdone. The story is also what makes The Grudge a great horror flick. It is a unique spin on the traditional ""haunted house"" tale that us fat lazy Americans are so used to seeing. ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""The Haunting"", ""13 Ghosts"", etc....catch my drift?What makes this ""haunted house"" tale so interesting is that it's done in a unique way. People come and go into the house as they please, they aren't ""trapped"" inside or anything. Some people die, and some people don't. It makes it more realistic because while it IS a haunted house, it only appears as a normal house (I guess that's what the average home in Japan looks like). There's no hokey and stereotypical:cobwebs, creaking doors, mysterious moving objects, etc. in the usual haunted house/ghost story flicks. The entire story is done in a series of short tales, each focusing on a character/group of characters. All the stories tie into each other throughout the film...leaving us sometimes confused. Think of how the different stories in the film, ""Pulp Fiction"" tie together to tell the entire movie, and that's somewhat the same direction the Grudge is aiming at (although definitely not as detailed/integrated). I like that this makes The Grudge stand out from the ""standard"" horror film. In fact, I can't recall off the top of my head about another horror film using this same technique. While not a new technique, it does make for a much more interesting film. Horror movies either aim to be scary or just fun. This one aims to be scary. A ""fun"" horror flick would be along the lines of Cabin Fever (meant to be a fun entertaining ride for the audience, concentrating on that and not on the scares)......and SCARY this is. Although i cannot say in fact what film is ""scary"" because that is a matter of opinion, but in my opinion...it is scary. I'm not going to have nightmares or anything, but yes, the film is creepy, atmospheric and scary. This is a GOOD THING. If you thought The Ring was scary, I consider this film to outdo the Ring on scares by 2 times at least.I just mentioned how creepy the film is. Why is it creepy? It's creepy because of the atmosphere. The house is pretty much a normal house, and the scares rely on the ghosts. I like that. Most horror movies try to rely on the setting too much for the scares and don't concentrate on the actual ""horror goods"". This film throws in a couple of really unique and creepy ghosts that certainly do their job, and do it well. So what's bad about this movie? What didn't I like you ask? A few things actually. Some of it doesn't seem to make too much sense plot wise. I also think that the film needs more blood/gore (although it's certainly good without it). I think a disturbingly creepy film like this would use the extra blood/gore in a much more effective way than the typical horror movie. You'll get what i'm talking about when you see the scene with Yoko (after she returns from the house). I think the characters could have been a little bit more interesting. Although this is horror, and horror films tend to have cardboard cutout characters, a big budget and ambitious film like this could have been even more effective with better characters. All in all, this film does what horror films are meant to do. It is scary, creepy, atmospheric, filmed in a unique way, and most importantly...original.Some people say this is ""like the Ring""...and I must argue. Both films are remakes of their same titled original Asian films, but that's really the only thing similar. The female ghost in The Grudge sorta looks like ""Samara"" from The Ring as well, but not like most people make it out to be.Don't let the critics stop you from watching this movie. It's worth the money in my opinion. Just go in knowing it's a horror movie, and not Hollywood's attempt to cash in at this year's Oscars and you'll end up leaving with a smile on your face. 8 out of 10 ratingCLIFF NOTES: This is a horror movie, not an attempt at an ""epic"" film. It has plot holes, some confusing scenes and somewhat ""dry"" characters. It does have scares, atmosphere, creepiness, and some unique direction/cinematography. It is a fun movie, one to take your girl to. If you enjoy horror movies, i simply cannot see how you wouldn't like this film. Enjoy.",The Grudge
284,billyzduke,Shimizu's Greatest Hits,6,23 October 2004,"Over the course of the past month, I happen to have seen all four Japanese Ju-On films, and last night I saw the American remake: The Grudge, all directed by Takashi Shimizu. I would have to say that the four Japanese films gradually decrease in quality from the inspired, economical original TV-movie to the just-about-average theatrical sequel, and the American film is basically a greatest hits compilation of the best scares from the Japanese films.Since almost all of these scenes are re-produced from the other films, down to the same camera angles in many cases, and the third Japanese film (the first theatrical version) was released stateside earlier this year, I didn't really see the point of this remake, other than to fill the Japanese horror gap between the American version of The Ring and its upcoming sequel. My biggest problem with the film itself was the use of the usual generic horror movie violin music, which gets exponentially louder and louder as the next jump scare approaches. The soundtracks of the original films are much less cluttered, so the minimal sound effects (the croaking, the meowing) are rendered more effective.In any case, five films drawn from a paragraph-long premise is more than enough. It's time for Shimizu to move on and prove there is more to Japanese horror than pale children and damp, stringy hair.For reference, the Japanese films are as follows:1. Ju-On: The Curse (2000)(TV) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330500/ (featuring Chiaki Kuriyama, Kill Bill's Go-Go Yubari)2. Ju-On: The Curse 2 (2000) (TV) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330501/ (the first half of this film is the last half of the first, so really these first two should be combined into one film)3. Ju-On: The Grudge (2003) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364385/ (theatrical remake of the first two films, but also functions as a sequel)4.

285,Viz79,The best 'haunted house' movie in recent history...,10,8 November 2004,"I think 'The Grudge' proves a number of things - firstly many audiences these days will not be scared by anything (if the Grudge doesn't pull it off there is pretty much nothing else that can and you 'have' to reach back to films such as the original Psycho etc) - a mix of conditioning and a dumbing of the general imaginations of people due to a number of factors is the cause. So one really can't blame a movie that is firing from all cylinders if yours are not.I 'love' haunted house movies and this is the ultimate one - I asked someone whether they would like to visit this one and their response after the movie was that they would not only not like to visit it but they wouldn't even want to look in its direction. 'That' is a house that has left a mark. From start to end we are left with a barrage of atmosphere which is tangible with a mix of jumps which really are a staple these days in these types of movies. The director remade this movie from its original for the Western public and he integrated the 'jumpiness' of those movies with the classic Japanese horrors of Ringu (which it relies *very* heavily upon, in fact to such a degree and copying certain elements that one needs to remember if you think of this movie as 'better' than Ringu/The Ring, which came first and thus deserves some of the originality praise).I think the movie was brilliant and deserves a rating in the 8s here rather than the late 5s but as I said, it has more to do with the public than the film. The storyline was not weak in my opinion - but in a movie of this length, there is little to be said except the 'event' that led to the 'curse' which then led to multiple deaths. I don't recall many of the old horrors having stellar stories either - perhaps the only criticism is that none of the characters were fleshed out very much including Sarah Michelle Gellar's character. I would say my heart is still with Sadako/Samara and the Ring but Ill definitely have to watch the original Ju-on just for comparison sake. I've long given up on relying on others to determine a decent movie and this one (from a true horror fan) is brilliant stuff and will be one of my favourites for quite some time. I also benefited from an audience that was sucked up by the movie in the cinema... the guy next to me jumped out of the seat only a few minutes in, people were screaming and the end was met with a hushed almost nervous silence.The movie was a huge success 'despite' the unimaginative public and that shows just how impressive it is - I have heard people laughed at certain scenes that one would consider far from amusing.. examples of either humour to hide nervousness or conditioning to all types of horrendous acts. You decide.",The Grudge
286,cobra_freak_006,it was bad. funny. but bad.,4,2 February 2012,"i was in high school when this movie came out. i remember seeing The Ring and being pretty creeped out so when i heard The Grudge was scarier i knew i wanted to see it. the movie trailer even creeped me out. well i was hanging out with my girlfriend at the time and her friend and her friends boyfriend. maybe a few other people there but thats not important. when the movie started i was getting excited. i knew i was in for a scare. well once the ghost kid starts showing up i couldn't hold it in anymore. i started laughing so hard people who were actually scared looked at me like i was nuts. especially when the little ghost kid meowed like a cat that cracked me up. i just couldn't take the movie seriously anymore. it was so horrible i wasn't even scared.the next day my other friends were talking about how it was the scariest movie they had ever seen and asked me if i saw it. i just told them ""i didn't know if i was watching a comedy or a horror movie""",The Grudge
287,goth_marilyn,Not what I expected,6,22 October 2004,"This movie, I thought would have a really complex plot, like The Ring, or at least one you could grasp onto. It did not. It did have it's moments, scary parts where things jumped out or made creepy sounds. But I really wasn't catching onto it. I thought maybe the movie would have a great twist at the end or a good ending. This movie ended abruptly, without any answers, hopefully there will be a second (like the second Ju-On) that will fill in the gaps. The creepy parts were creative, but sometimes predictable... I like sarah michelle geller (sp?) more now though, which is saying quite a bit. The other characters were not developed enough, it seemed like the movie didn't last long enough for things to really get going. I thought the beginning was scary, but the ending wasn't. It all depends on what scares you, this one didn't do it for me. Although my sister says she is going to have nightmares, I probably won't. All in all, I give this movie a 6/10",The Grudge

289,TheFilmProf,A Sentiment You May Hold After Seeing It,3,7 June 2006,"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about ""The Grudge"" is that this kind of film is still being made at all. In what amounts to a knockoff of a remake of any already too rehashed idea, ""The Grudge"" offers nothing that's new or refreshing in a genre that for all practical purposes has seen better days--at least in this structure.Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a student living in Tokyo with her boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr), and both give equally limited performances in their roles, though it should be said that there isn't much to work with for either character, and both roles amount to little more than catalysts designed to set the stage for the supernatural events in which they become entangled.In a nutshell (which is more than large enough to contain this overly simplistic plot), Karen, in need of some credits in social service, is sent to the home of Emma, an invalid who suffers from some form of dementia, after the regularly assigned worker fails to show up (we know why, since we're privy to her dispatch during the opening credits.) Karen soon discovers an evil presence in the house, all related to a double murder/suicide which occurred several years earlier. And, as we are also to learn, in Japan, once such evil befalls a house, it never leaves--which I believe also holds true in Transylvania and several other places, too. Anyway, everyone who would ever live in this place would be subjected to the wrath--or more precisely, 'the grudge', held by those who were killed there. Episodically, and through some flashbacks that contribute more to a level of confusion than clarity, details of the murders unfold, and we are increasingly given more visual information of the not-very-dead-but-very-evil-spirits. Suggestions, allusions and intimations abound, but nothing of any real consequence ever actually happens to these characters, nor to any of the other myriad of characters.""The Grudge"", directed by Takashi Shimizu, a reworking of his original Japanese ""Ju On"" concept designed to include American actors and English for obvious box office appeal, isn't really a bad film, but it's extremely mediocre and predictable. But if you can look beyond the obvious and clichéd devices, you'll see that it has some notable cinematography by Hideo Yamamoto, and an effective, muted lighting design that are both worthy of a much better and more serious effort. Mostly though, it relies on an overworked, and too often, unimaginative plot, and it fails to incorporate any traits of humanism in the mostly unseen, evil beings. What made characters like Dracula, Quasimodo, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man--even King Kong--so frightful, was their embodiment of human traits and the inner conflict between their humanity and their monstrosity. More than just making viewers afraid of its horror character, a film should also impart to the viewer the fear, however unlikely one may deem it, that becoming such a fearsome monster--whether by accident of nature, science, or psychology--is, perhaps, just a misstep away. That's what's scary. Cutting quickly to close ups of fleeting, ephemeral images, reinforced by loud audio crescendos for punctuation, may provide shocks of involuntary startle responses, but it doesn't really create--or worse--doesn't sustain any real suspense or tension. There is a decided lack of any cumulative effect to all of these sounds and images in ""The Grudge"", and no subsequent lingering doubts as to whether such evils could really exist in the world. A good horror film should at least raise that remote possibility, even to the most ardent doubters of such phenomena. And if you don't think that can happen, watch ""The Exorcist"".© 2004",The Grudge
290,max_tony,It doesn't matter what you do or who you are -- you're toast...,8,6 September 2009,"The Grudge is the American remake of the Japanese horror film. What's different about The Grudge is it's non-linear story line. At first you think it's three separate stories, then just two, and finally you realize that your seeing interspersed story lines from the past and from the present and they meet at the end of the film -- filling you in on the curse and what's happening. (Think Momento and Identity) The scariest part of the story, and it is pretty creepy, is that because the curse born as a result of the first murder kills indiscriminately anyone who enters the house. Not immediately. Not in the same way. No matter what you do, you can't outwit it. If you were in the house, it's got your number. The scariest thing is most of the people involved were innocent -- they had nothing to do with the original killing, when seeing the ghost while shocked, they tried to help. Yet, still they died. There might have been a way to avoid the curse but unfortunately, it didn't get carried out. There's no CGI/FX -- everything is low key and creepy. I'd almost say this is more psychological horror than monster coming to get you horror but never the less -- you'll probably end up sleeping with the lights on and wondering if you should ever go into a house you don't know anything about again.",The Grudge
291,DumaNV,Some good moments but very unsatisfying,5,14 February 2005,"There is a very good style that operates in this movie, one that sets up the anticipation of event and then delivers, often by raising the goose flesh up for a few moments. But, alas, it is only style. The story itself lets the movie down. Comparing this to ""The Ring"" it falls below expectation and promise. Whereas the ""The Ring"" actually generated some type of emotion about the characters involved, and you wanted know what happened poor little girl, in this movie you hardly care about anyone, let alone the boy or the group of people that come into contact with the house and the spirits therein.It's disappointing because it should have been better. It had a good cast and the story could have been developed move, but in the end the director shot for creating a mood and style and ignored his primary objective of telling a story.",The Grudge
292,DubVersion,"Not bad, not good either",6,23 January 2005,"*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS **** This is another Hollywood of an Asian horror. It over-concentrates on suspension and unfortunately, it eats away at everything else. The suspense works, certainly in the beginning, therefore i give this movie a 6/10. However, the story is thin and far fetched. Worse, one of the ghostly appearances is a little child. Apparently the new trend is that little kids are horrific and frightening. I'm sorry, but that doesn't work for me; i would bitch slap a ghost like this.From what i have seen so far, Asian horrors have what Hollywood lacks: originality. But as i have mentioned in other reviews i've wrote: originality does not make a movie good. It just gives the advantage; you still have to score the points.Furthermore, there are several plot holes that just simply don't add up. It seems that the time line of a few things should be reviewed. But hey, it's about the suspense. And there's plenty of it. Even the way the ghosts are portrayed in an original way, making up for the downsides of this movie.The acting is mediocre at best. I'm not a fan of Buffy the Vampire slayer, and she fails to develop her character or shine in her role. This is what i expect of a good actor.*** BIG SPOILER *** In the end, it is clear that there wanted to make a sequel; the story ends too abrupt for no apparent reason. Also, some questions are left unanswered, leaving the viewer empty handed. How can you kill the ghost ? Why was she the first time not attacked, when she grandmother died ? Why did the Grudge change his shape ? Why did the professor commit suicide ? Was this movie really worth it ? Why haven't they burnt down the house after the first killings ? If the police knew something ghostly was going on, why did they act the way they did; why wasn't there much more investigation ? The list goes on and on...So, considering all things, but concentrating on the sheer pleasure i got from watching it, i have to give this movie 5.5 out of 10. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Besides, you'll be tempted again when the obvious sequel comes out.",The Grudge
293,friskysman,Wall to wall scares,8,22 August 2005,"Nearly all the reviews I have read on ""The Grudge"" have hated it. That combined with the fact that this is one of those dreaded ""PG-13 Horror Movies"" led me to come into watching this film as a huge skeptic. So I really have to give credit to the filmmakers when I admit that I loved this movie. Is it the greatest horror movie of all time? Of course not. But you know what? It's the scariest darn PG-13 movie I've ever seen. Period.I won't bother with the long plot description. Everyone else does that but you are not here for spoilers; you're here for opinions. My opinion of this film could not be much higher. For me, the standard for PG-13 movies has always been ""The Ring"". For a movie that showed very little blood and gore, ""The Ring"" was horrifying. I mostly enjoyed how the entire movie led to a terrifying climax that gets me every time.I was not at all expecting ""The Grudge"" to surpass ""The Ring"", but in setting my expectations so low, the movie blew by them and, in the process, even overtook ""The Ring"". So how is ""The Grudge"" better? The one thing that struck me was the legitimate almost non-stop scares. This movie rarely ever lets up, as there is a constant sense of dread that hangs over the entire movie like a dark rain cloud. There are no laughs in this movie, very few pauses for our hero to do some research (though, there is indeed a dreaded ""research scene"", but it is brief), and no ""fake scares"". Yes, there is an ""Only A Cat"" moment, but the cat does have an important part in the movie so I don't really count it as a fake scare. But if you want to, fine. One fake scare.Aside from those few minor flaws, ""The Grudge"" is an unflinching ride. This movie is almost a direct remake of the original Japanese movie ""Ju-on"". It features the same director, crew and even some of the original actors. The result is a movie that is not your typical American horror film. Even ""The Ring"" is based on the Japanese ""Ringu"" and it falls into some of the American horror movie pitfalls, but ""The Grudge"" does not. It is not afraid to kill off anybody, and I mean ANYBODY. It does not hide itself behind a wall of CGI. And did I mention that is has no problem with killing off the entire cast if it has to? Yep, for a PG-13 Horror Movie, ""The Grudge"" is pretty brutal. Yes, it is essentially about a haunted house and the ghosts that inhabit it. I know it's been done a thousand times before. But, for me, that isn't the point. The point is, unlike most haunted house movies, ""The Grudge"" is truly scary. Is the acting top notch? No. Is the plot original? No. Is the writing that good? Uh-uh. But I didn't care. The movie scared me, and when it comes to horror movies -- especially the PG-13 variety -- that's all I ask.",The Grudge
294,carlsbadrn,One of the Scariest Films Ever,10,23 June 2006,"I have The Grudge on DVD and watched it again this morning with surround sound and a widescreen TV. It scared me just as much as the first time I ever saw. Unrelenting in its content and editing, they show you a quick glimpse of something with musical sounds added for extra scare value. I spoke with a young man who is half Japanese and he tells me that yes, this belief is common and true in Japan. They believe that when a person dies a violent death the essence of the crime remains and builds until anyone who becomes involved in any way, shape or form is affected by it. I've seen many films over the years but none can compare to the horror in this. What made it more terrifying is that it took place in Tokyo, Japan, a most unlikely place for a haunted house movie. There were no silly gimmicks, no laugh breaks to ease the tension, just horror upon horror building to a chilling climax. I suggest if you've never seen this movie, by all means do so. Today. Or preferably, tonight!",The Grudge
295,mike0120-1,Should not even scare little kids,3,8 January 2006,"Sarah Michelle Gellar gives another fine performance in a film that is not worthy of her talent. ""The Grudge"" is a silly movie that had a bunch of potential but was wasted when the script forgot one major ingredient in a good scary movie: the film has to be scary! The main villain in this trash looks worse than the girl from ""The Ring"". She makes a very dumb(and ANNOYING!) sound when she appears. Ditto for the kid who makes the cat sounds. After 5-10 minutes your eyes get heavy and you lose interest. Even if the movie was not supposed to be about the death and scares, at least it should have given the viewer more mystery and reason to spend money on it. The most disappointing movie of 2004, by far. 3/10",The Grudge
296,muvcritic,No Terror Lost in Translation in The Grudge,7,25 October 2010,"""The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was wrong."" -- Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar)It's a curious paradox. Human beings desperately hope there is a life after death, yet the core of all our nightmares is the terror evoked by anyone (or anything) that has actually managed to transcend death. It's instinctive: We just know that ain't supposed to happen. Ah, but if it didn't, there wouldn't be any need for Halloween -- currently, if polls and surveys are to be trusted, America's second favorite holiday -- or the creepy movies we like to celebrate it with.Like The Ring, The Grudge is a transliteration of an original Japanese film which deals with a fury that not even death can extinguish. And, like its predecessor, The Grudge combines time-tested techniques for startling an audience with an impressive and distinct visual style that takes those techniques and pushes the envelope, as well as recasting the story with better known occidental faces -- in this case, Sara Michelle Gellar, who has forged a career by fighting the supernatural in five years of starring as Buffy, The Vampire Slayer, and for the toddler set, the live-action Scooby Doo franchise. Well, I'm here to tell you that, hopefully, no toddlers will be attending The Grudge because, if they do, don't count on 'em sleeping through the night anytime soon. Geller stars as Karen, an American student in Japan who supplements her income by providing at-home care for housebound, English-speaking invalids. When one of her co-workers evidently fails to report for work, she is sent to fill in. It's, of course, immediately evident that something isn't right with the suburban home, as she and other witnesses keep seeing an eerie, noncommunicative Japanese child accompanied by a yowling black cat. Of course, the audience knows immediately that the boy and his ill-tempered pet are dead as doornails, with Karen left to solve the mystery of why their spirits are so restless.I'll confess right now that, while I've never experienced anything that I even remotely suspected was supernatural, I'm a sucker for scary movies, and writer/director Takashi Shimizu (who also helmed the Japanese original) knows all the right buttons to push, and then some. I'll qualify by saying that close friends have told me about some nightmarish apparitions, two even reporting manifestations not unlike several pictured in this film. I've even arrived on the scene scant minutes after such encounters, but, as I was told once by a psychic, I'm so insensitive and close-minded to the world around me that I'm completely incapable of perceiving the paranormal. Well, good, because if there are horrific things like these prowling around, I don't want to see 'em. Except, of course, in movies.However, the principal difference between ""real"" hauntings and cinematic ones, at least of what I've read and been told by supposed witnesses about things that jump out of closets, is that's all they ever really do. Any actual harm to a human being resulting from an encounter with a ghost is always personal injury due to trying to get the hell out of the house. But, if you didn't have actual victims in a film, there wouldn't be enough conflict, so movie ghosts, it seems, must have homicidal intent to be interesting. Accordingly, the wraiths in The Grudge are intent on drafting as many living humans to join their undead existence as possible, and they're pretty successful.The only place The Grudge really breaks down is in repeating the mistake of so many American horror movies, which is the Law of Dark Places: If there is somewhere you are convinced is inhabited by a dangerous maniac/demon/monster, as many of your cast members as possible must go there alone, and preferably at night, so they can be conveniently picked off one by one. In the last 20 minutes, no less than three characters, who all know what awaits them, race off alone to the haunted house, in the dead of night. There may admittedly be some justification because one of Shimizu's dramatic innovations is the realization that, having once visited the house, its evil will follow you wherever you go and you can never be safe again, and there's some mighty creepy stuff going on in Japanese office towers, commuter trains, even a local police station. Still, who in his right mind is going to go back in a house that is the very nexus of the evil?Certainly not yours truly, and I will readily admit I completely agreed with the members of the audience exhorting the characters, especially Geller's, not to return. The Grudge is an audience participation film, which you will certainly not get anywhere near the full impact of if you wait to see it on video in the safety of your own home. Fear, like humor, is a vastly more potent emotion when experienced communally.",The Grudge

Apparently in Japan, when you kill someone in an act of rage, a curse is put open the place and everyone that comes in there will die. Wow! Just wow. The thought is scary enough. Wait no, that's not the right word. Maybe it is stupid? Come on! Not only is he idea of the movie stupid, the bringing forth of the film is worse. Open the door, there it is. Open another door, there the other one is! It is so repetitive, there is near no gore, no jump scares, nothing to keep me interested. Going in to seeing this I had high hopes. I had heard good things about it. But I want to put those lies to rest. If you are reading this, don't waste your time to watch this film.

299,northwatuppa,inedible cinematic food,3,5 February 2005,"Once in awhile, you encounter a meal that lacks virtually all of the qualities that make a meal worth eating. The food has no texture, no taste, no nutritional substance and it is visually unappealing. It isn't repugnant, it is just lacking in all the qualities that make food pleasurable. And, although it is not overtly offensive, it is just a chore to eat it .The Grudge is like that.There is no intriguing narrative arc. The characters are not developed to the point where you might start caring about any of them. There is no real emotional involvement. And, well, there is nothing like a pleasing or edifying resolution. There isn't really a hero that you can cheer for. Or anything in the way of grim humor.There aren't even really any intriguing attempts at murky metaphysical explanations of the kind horror fans enjoy, or not much of a one, anyway. Visually, it is plain vanilla. And so on and so forth. Pretty much a waste.",The Grudge
300,Placemat,"Respecting ""Grudge""?",7,5 February 2005,"Populating a remake of a foreign film with well-known American actors helps to attract an American audience who otherwise might not watch the original. The makers of ""The Grudge"" have brought in Sarah Michelle Gellar for Takashi Shimizu's American reworking of his own ""Ju-on."" While ""The Grudge"" succeeds in being a masterful film in its own right, placed alongside the original it still cannot weather some drop-off in the chill factor.In ""Ju-on"" a curse envelopes and dispatches ordinary people for no apparent rhyme or reason besides bad luck. The film's success has its basis in its ability to sustain throughout its running time, a permeating mood of unease. The obscurity of its actors (especially for a foreign audience) coupled with the banality of the film's minimalist, documentary look creates a sense for the audience that they are watching something real. Once this perception of ordinariness is established, whenever something surreal and out of place appears in frame, the effect is truly unsettling.Unfortunately, the introduction of Gellar (as well as Bill Pullman and others) in the remake thwarts the attempt to cast the same spell. While there is nothing technically wrong with Gellar's performance, her very identifiability is a liability. Her presence signals too loudly that the person on screen is an actress and calls too much attention to the film as ""film."" Similarly, the Hollywood gloss of the film's look also takes some of the polish off the original's simulated realism.Since most of ""The Grudge"" is shot-for-shot identical to the original, the remake still is expert in generating its fair amount of shocks. (Furthermore, ""The Grudge"" also reveals the origins of the curse for those for whom explanations are a plus.) As with ""Ringu"" and its remake, the recommendation to the viewer who desires maximum queasiness would be in favor of the original.",The Grudge

302,Diaboliqa666,First movie to scare me in years,9,13 April 2005,"This movie is brilliant, but I have to warn It is not for those soft in the brain area. This is a thinking persons horror movie. It leaves behind the usually gore that todays movies seem to rely on, and has a much more aesthetic approach.You will be scared by movement, music and noise, not by chainsaw, blood and gore. The idea of the movie will scare you at first, then when you think about it you will become terrified.There is some beautiful play with the time line and perspective, not to mention some good effects, but it is the sound that does all the work. Sudden noises, creepy guttural groans, the music.....it all builds an atmosphere of horror like I haven't experienced in a long time.Concept wise, it is simple and great. If you die experiencing extreme rage or sorrow, you leave the emotions behind in the place you die. These emotions then act as a curse for everyone who comes in contact with the house. The spirits hunt you down and kill you, no matter where you are or what you do. That is the truly scary part for me, that you just can't get away from it, not even going into your own home.A family dies in the house in question, The father finds out his wife is in love with another man, drowns their son, kills her and the cat then hangs himself. 3 years later a family buys the house. The older mother becomes mentally damaged, her son and his wife disappear and end up dead, the sister vanishes off the face of the earth and the original minder of the mother has her jaw removed. This movie has everything - go and see it, if your a smart human you shouldn't be disappointed.",The Grudge
303,Bmovie,All atmosphere and actor dedication,8,22 October 2004,"Sam Raimi recognizes talent when he sees it (and provides good work for this brother sometimes). He has done both here as he ""unleashes"" Shimizu, the director of the original Japanese film (and its various film and TV sequels) and as he chooses actors who bring a presence to the screen right away. The latter is necessary since this film is all about atmosphere. It is not character driven and, though the plot - more accurately, the story - reveals itself, it does so in the time sequence the director chooses. He chooses well as you see in a sequence involving Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar late in the film.Clearly, the actors purposely subordinate themselves to the director's vision. He counts on them to help create the atmosphere he is creating as much or more than on special effects and scary moments. This couldn't have been easy for the actors since they have to react to things they can barely imagine in often claustrophobic settings. Gellar and Pullman prove particularly adept and manage to bring a humanity to their roles that helps frame the scares.There are plenty of scares but they are mostly not of the cheap variety even though the traditional black cat is around to pounce out occasionally. These scares are real but they also tend to be somewhat cerebral. You may think and jump at the same time.I would judge this to be better than the original film. Shimizu second guesses himself successfully. This may be because he has had a lot of practice or because Raimi was the producer a film like this needed or because he had a better budget. In any case, The Grudge turns out to be a very good example of the latest trend in fright movies.",The Grudge

305,pawned79,Don't be mislead. The Grudge's story is very good.,8,1 November 2004,"* No Spoilers for The Grudge * * Spoilers for The Ring *I have read a lot of the reviews here on IMDb stating that this movie really lacks story in compared to The Ring. This isn't true. I didn't actually see The Ring until after I saw The Grudge. Some friends and I watch The Ring over Halloween weekend and I was surprised at how ""not scary"" it was. A friend there who had never seen it described it as ""extremely intriguing"" but not scary. Other than the creepy video (which really isn't that creepy compared to the one in Ringu) and dead girl's body in the closet at the beginning (which really sent chills up my spin), the movie didn't give you much of a fright until the very end. What it did give you though is spoonfuls of story -- just handed to you -- one little piece of investigation evidence at a time, until the characters and the audience understood exactly what happened. In the Grudge, it's the opposite. The Grudge scares you constantly and doesn't spoon-feed you the answer. Its there -- I thought it was obvious. Apparently a lot of people on IMDb didn't though. This movie is exceptionally well done with the Raimi brothers probably loving every minute of it. Did I mention that the movie is scary?Long-short of it:The Ring = Very good, Very Intriguing, Creepy The Grudge = Very good, Intriguing, Very Creepy* Personal Experience - No Spoilers *I saw The Grudge with a friend. We went in with the sun not quite set. There were some really good previews for some upcoming movies. I think 2005 may be a very good year for film. The Grudge started and the audience was nearly screaming in terror for the next two hours. I think I had a big smile on my face the entire time for some reason. I remember thinking to myself that I refuse to close my eyes at any point. I really wanted to experience the entire film as it was meant to be. My friend had her head in my shoulder for most of the movie. Did I mention the movie was scary? So, here's the really funny part. When the movie ended, that theater cleared out so freaking fast. I don't know if there was anything during or after the credits but no one in the theater saw it. We bolted out of there, my heart was pumping very fast. I felt like I just spent two hours on a roller-coaster (literally). We drove across the street to McDonalds because it was open and really well lit. The place was nearly empty and we were standing around waiting for our food, looking over our shoulders and at the windows to see the reflections, just all sorts of stuff like that. Anytime a door opened we both bolted an eye in that direction. I'm sure the workers thought we were going to rob the place or something. It took me many days to get the images out of my eyes. Still today, sometimes I get a little nervous to open the closet or something. More friends and I are going to go watch it again this week. It won't be as good the second time around, but I will keep an eye on my friends because that can be just as entertaining.* Fin *",The Grudge

308,GlennBeckFan,"Ghastly Ghouls, Gargling Gophers",1,21 October 2004,"***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers***spoilersThere are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness. Such is the case with Columbia Pictures' 'The Grudge.' This cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned American saw a Japanese made for TV film 'Ju-on' and was inspired to remake the movie in English. This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in Orlando on October 21, 2004.The premise, and I use the word loosely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby, rambunctious but evil second grader. Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? Sure there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who I have affectionately named Chim Chim. (Remember Speed Racer?) As you have already guessed, they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that, I forget. The story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian Bill Pullman leaping to his death from a balcony. My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Next we endure the mildly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko, 'oh no don't go in there' screams the audience, but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar might be a competent actress but I could not help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that it was distracting. It is the equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you may, you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous. But I digress, Karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us. She snoops around, meets the ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other stuff happens. Watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues I half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! 'I would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours!' Director Takashi Shimizu, who is vying to be the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions involving sound. First, he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. This is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher. After the movie, I heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing.Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the sole survivor. And of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel but an apology. 'The Grudge' could be easily re-edited into a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value. Baring that, this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since 'Godzilla vs. Megalon.' I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves.",The Grudge

I am either getting very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A** job! (Can't wait for Boogeyman!)I was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished I had someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge. I saw the movie by myself.) I swear, there were many many jump scenes that were NOT expected! I felt foolish but my nerves did not care! I was on edge the entire movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. I keep thinking of that sound, though, and I DO NOT LIKE IT!I actually gasped aloud a few times, and cried, ""oh"" at one scene!! Oh, yeah, I even half-covered my eyes a few times! Word to the wise, though: I thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho, but I don't remember the movie so can't compare.I can't say I ""enjoyed"" this movie b/c I was terrified, but it was very very good and scary.

The movie did not disappoint in the visuals department either, and is one of the more atmospheric movies I have seen recently. For me, it was money well spent.Note: Pay attention in this movie. A situation will develop in the movie, and then the movie cuts to another set of scenes that explain how that situation came about. There is NO indication when this cut happens, so you will get confused if you aren't prepared for this. Some of the people that didn't ""get"" the movie probably fell victim to this.",The Grudge

313,Buttsludge,Some of the scares could be better but still holds up,7,16 July 2021,"Horror movies sometimes have that trope where the first character you see sets an example and ends up dying very quickly and thats no exception here. The grudge quickly draws you in with 2 scares back to back in the first 10 minutes. However the first one, ( the man jumping from a building,) is sort of lackluster. The wife or girlfriends reaction to seeing him jump is kind of unbelievable.The settings all look very believable and the sound design is great, the music has a suspenseful eerie feeling which works appropriately during scares and helps build tension.We go through a handful of different characters quickly before we get introduced to the starring actress which is kind of weak because you expect to get to know the first people youre introduced to in a film.A third scare is hard to judge because it comes in the form of a woman we know is sick and needs to be taken care of pressing her hands up to a glass window and then her hand slapping down on the protagonists foot as she goes to inspect it. I can see how some people might jump at the thuds but after having seen this movie a couple times it no longer affects me.It works almost more as a detective mystery movie than a horror movie at points and the story can be kind of lost upon you from how it jumps from character to character; you dont know who youre supposed to be following.Most of the scares are okay but you can see them from a mile away and when they finally happen it wouldnt be as strong as it could be if it wasnt drawn out so long.Some of the special effects such as the hair creeping down from the corner of the room and then forming a hair demon look pretty dated but not terrible.One of my favorite scares in this movie comes in the form of a man reaching into a tub of dark water to pull the drain and then a childs face rising to the surface as a cry lets out You expect it coming and its a bit jump scarey but it's one of those things thats engrained in human behavior to be on edge about.Theres a missed opportunity to get what i think would be a great looking shot when jennifer goes to inspect the stairs. We know somethings going to be up there by now by how they prior scares are set up. We see jenn in the left side of the frame and a mirror reflecting the stairs before the camera rotates and shows us another angle. We could have a shot that scares the audience but not the actress by having the kid ghosts legs flash by on the mirror. It would work well because we the audience see the mirror but not the actress. Instead we get a fake scare in the cat hissing and then a real scare with the boys pale arms reaching to grab the cat. Since theres an expected scare missing and then a fake scare it sort of weakens the effect of this one.When the sick lady's son comes home and goes to check on jennifer we get some good foreshadowing of the iconic rattley vocal fry sound that this movie is known for. We see jenn lying in bed in a catatonic state unable to form words; only the undulating vocal fry.I like the scare of the boy standing up at the side of the bed and then his meow that sends the male actor falling back, but the scare that follows is kind of not great. We see him look up and the boys face crawls into view and then he meows and lunges forward a bit and then the scene cuts out.I feel like this could have been done a bit more effectively and I don't like this scare as much as when he just stands up from the side of the bed.The gore effects are not great . When see matthew and jennifers corpses in the attic they look more like dummies. Also when we see the severed jaw it looks like its made of wax.I like the scene with matthews sister at work we feel paranoid with her . I like how the hair demon is climbing up the stairs instead of down them. If it were coming from above she could just run down the stairs and escape but since theyre coming from below it cuts off her escape and traps her in the building. This is something that could have been messed up but is done right. This whole scene is good except for the shots of the ghost demon itself. Its jittery movement doesnt really look scary more like someone trying to be scary and when it grabs at the thing dangling from her phone from the door way it isnt really scary and the face in the darkness looks kind of silly.With a different make up approach for the ghost face it could be scarier.The special effects of the shadow girl materializing on the security camera screen is not great looking but its disguised in the pixelated security camera screen so its not a huge fault.It plays a trick on the audience when we see susan get a call from matthew. We just saw his corpse in the attic so how could it really be his voice on the phone. The audience knows that it must be a trick so when she looks through the peephole and sees him standing there we know its not really him . The next scare is one this movie became known for with the hair demons face appearing under the covers but then it copies a nightmare on elm street with her dragging susan into the bed and them both disappearing.The scare with the ghosts face appearing in the bus window is pretty bad and just pointless. We get an obligatory scary movie shower scene with the ghosts hand appearing in the back of her head in her hair and then she gasps and then nothing happens. I have a huge gripe with this because where it is in the film ruins it and it had potential to be good. If it was nearer the beginning of the movie, before you really knew there were ghosts, and the same scene happened and then just had karen investigating and finding nothing, it would lead the audience towards what to expect from the film effectively. But because it's thrown in later on after we already know theres ghosts and there's no follow up, it doesnt really work as effectively as it could if it was just placed better in time in the story.The next scare is actually pretty good with the bloody jawless shambling corpse slowly revealing its mangled face. But the actors reaction to it is kind pretty comical. This is one of the better gore scenes of the film but its still kind of computerized looking.One of this movies biggest faults is that were halfway through it and although theres all these strange and scary things happening we still have no idea why theyre happening and it works more as a setup for whats to come in the future movies than as its own stand alone film.We dont really get to know whats going on until karen goes researching on the computer literally 2/3rds of the way through the whole run time when we see an article showing about the family murder which set the curse in motion in the first place. This is just bad writing to me having it finally revealed all at once why its happening, there could have been hints and clues along the way but instead we just get the words at the intro when someone dies in rage they leave behind a curse and then 1 hour into the 1 and a half hour long movie we finally learn all at once that the ghosts are victims of a domestic violence case.The movie has a strong big finale ending where the worst part is just when a book flips open by itself. The rest of the final act is the best part of the whole movie with the reveal of the murder the most consistent shots of the ghosts which is genuinely pretty creepy this time.All in all its not bad, the acting is good most of the time but has some blunders, particularly reactions to things happening could be stronger. The romantic scenes are pretty cheesy and the scares could have been done more effectively. The whole movie works better as part of a series than as a standalone movie but its still interesting to watch and might leave you sleeping with the light on
The feelings left behind once its over of being stalked by a supernatural presence is strong and one of the reasons i believe this film was successful and had people talking about it.Its slightly above average to good. Its not terribly scary and could be filed under the mystery section instead of horror.",The Grudge

These are the same people that didn't get scared by ""Psycho"" or ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"". These are the same people that hate the movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" because it was unrealistic. These people nay-say EVERYTHING. I CAN'T STAND THESE KIND OF PEOPLE - IF YOU DO NOT LIKE ""THE GRUDGE"" YOU ARE A CLOSE MINDED, BORING INDIVIDUAL.As you can tell, I have some emotion tied up with anyone who says this movie was not that good. I am 34 years old, and would go so far as to consider myself a ""big boy"". I saw ""The Ring"", but it did not mess with me like this movie has. I have gotten the chills in my own apartment over this movie, I have found it hard to go to sleep a couple of times. Just this morning at around 4:00AM I was awakened by a noisy cat just outside my window. It was growling and hissing...I was not able to get back to sleep (See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about).I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy scary movies with haunting images and frightening sounds - YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.8/10",The Grudge
315,brennan79,It Never Forgets And Neither Will You (VERY MINOR SPOILERS),10,23 October 2004,"I went to see The Grudge with three of my friends. Even though I am a long (long, long, long) time die-hard horror film aficionado, I (for the first time ever) found the movie so frightening, I was almost in tears. While my best friend agreed with me, the two other friends with us did not find it particularly scary at all. I was shocked to hear them say this until I realized what was going on. Those two friends had seen the 2004 remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and left the theater in a similar state to the one I was in after ""The Grudge"". While I found ""TCM"" to be an excellent and devoted re-visioning, it did not scare me in the least...just like the original version was an excellent film but not frightening (in my opinion).Those two friends are terrified by ""real life"" (i.e. nothing supernatural) blood and gore films. That sub-genre of horror is everything ""The Grudge"" is not. Instead, ""The Grudge"" represents everything that has frightened me and haunted my imagination since I was a child. It is an unrelenting barrage of humans who open their mouths to release completely inhuman sounds (that literally make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end), people walking down dark hallways with a lurching limp or with their heads rolled impossibly far to one side, children who appear sweet and innocent only to look subtly inhuman and undeniably demonic upon closer view, things that are not under the bed but already in the bed waiting for you, evil that will unquestionably win in the end...it's only a matter of how much Hell you are willing to put yourself through until that defeat occurs. What makes these things (and the film as a whole) so terrifying to me is that in all of these figments of the darker recesses of imagination lies the inherent realization that they are not so completely far-fetched that they could never actually happen. They are all ordinary things that take on a sinister new personality by simply enhancing or omitting a single characteristic of the norm. This is made all the better by the tradition of Japanese filmmakers to leave it up to the audience to decide the full reasons behind the events rather than spell everything out for us...a practice not forgotten in this remake. If this type of Twilight Zone-ish horror is your cup of tea, then you will leave this film feeling as though you may never sleep with both eyes shut again. When on of the victims slowly turns around to reveal a greatly contorted mouth missing the lower jaw, I felt the need to look behind me to make sure she wasn't occupying any nearby theater seats. That is something that never crossed my mind during ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". 10/10",The Grudge
316,skelly-4,I really loved this movie,10,1 November 2004,"I love Horror movies, in fact i love most movies, but Horror movies are cool, there are many ways to rate movies on technical prowess and art and photography, but I look at films as to what I can get out of them, if a film can bring an emotion out of me then I think it was a film worth seeing. Now to look at the acting and basic story line this film isn't a classic, but for a scary film this really works. The scenes in the film are all just connected by frail threads, but the build up of suspense and those jumpy scenes are so intense, I watched this last night Halloween! and the cinema was packed even though it was full it was silent then everyone jumps and then laughs feeling stupid, but thats what i'm talking about! this film brought an emotion out in people and that was fear, so if a horror movie is meant to make you scared then I feel that this film has over achieved. for a rating I would give it a 6.5 but for horror thrills and a really good night out i would give it a 10.PS I have seen the originals, well the two movies versions i like JU-ON Grudge 2 best. I would really recommend watching them, but this one was cool too and it wasn't like the ring which i thought the original Japanese one was far superior, I felt this was equally as good, I can't say enough good things about the film, Pure Shocking Fun!!",The Grudge

The director plays one trick (I'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. To conclude, I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor ""The Ring"" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for ""The Grudge"" is a waste of money.",The Grudge

Absolutely silly from beginning to end! Being a fan of scary movies, I think I have seen them all, but this is by far the worst. What was the Director thinking about??? And I just saw Sarah Michael [whatever her other name is] come to London to promote that movie! I feel sorry for her. I would be so embarrassed to go into a private viewing of this movie if I had been on it. From the very beginning, this ridiculous figure/silhouette/stain appearing chasing people (some hardly related with the house) was so bizarre! And what's with Sarah M... washing her hair and getting some weird sort of bars coming out of the back of her head??? What on Earth has that to do with a dead person haunting the house. At the end, you can imagine what is supposed to be happening thanks to the [third] restatement of the opening thought (something along the lines of ""where some one dies full of rage, they leave some sort of jinx..."") Dreadful, dreadful! Acting was so poor. Perhaps the leading lady has done so much vampire hunting that she could not put on a credible face projecting fear or surprise. I can only think that this was created on the basis of some Oriental approach to thrillers unknown in the western hemisphere.

Sure, you don't expect a masterpiece story line in a horror movie, but come on, this one sounds like a very bad ghost story you would laugh at by the camp fire. So basically what you have here is a pile of supposedly creepy scenes consisting of worn out images of zombie looking children, cats, something that looks like hair i suppose it was, you have some burping and meowing sound effects to amplify the level of senselessness. I guess the makers assumed it would be scary since people are supposed to be scared what they don't understand and rationally explain. Well, not here. Yes I admit, some moments might creep you out on occasion, but it becomes obvious quite quickly that the extremely poor plot is just a cheap excuse to put a bunch creepy images in the movie. Nope, doesn't work, because what perfectly backs up creepy visuals, is the creepy story. But I guess we couldn't have both.I don't know. Maybe I'm too demanding. Maybe a bit of effort is too much to ask these days. Maybe I've been playing too much Silent Hill (because that, although not a movie, is a perfect combination of extremely creepy story and creepy images, and the 'fear of the unexplained' theory works perfectly there).Not a good movie.

325,srfm79,A little too mysterious,6,21 May 2006,"""The Grudge"" is an OK horror movie. It has a thoroughly unpleasant atmosphere and lots of well directed shocks. Unfortunately, the mysterious paranormal going-ons get more and more mysterious as the movie progresses, eventually canceling the viewer's expectation of an answer to any of the questions raised (much as, without comparison, in David Lynch's ""Lost Highway""). Consequently, one's interest is bound to drop. However, if you do not demand a terribly consistent plot line, if you thrive on the nightmarish and unexplained, if you like camp fire story-like scariness (as in e.g. ""The Blair Witch Project"")...

326,qed77,The power of Sarah Michelle Gellar,10,31 October 2004,"For me, The Grudge was well done. It was different yet extremely frightening. Yet the reactions to this movie are varied. The terror comes from an intense psychological assault. As this movie comes from a different culture, this has caused confusion for even a great reviewer like Roger Ebert. There is, however, one thing that we can agree on. Without the great Sarah Michelle Gellar, this movie could not have succeeded. Throughout the Buffy years, her movies, and her appearance on the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, she has shown that she can do it all. She can project the entire range of human emotions through her acting, she can dance and sing, she is an accomplished comedienne, and she is willing to take risks.The amazing attendance during the first two weeks of The Grudge show the power that Sarah Michelle has at the box office. Recent Oscar winners like Julia Roberts, Halle Berry, and Gwyneth Paltrow could not begin the take on the range of projects that Ms Gellar has taken on. When will Hollywood begin to offer Sarah Michelle the scripts that she has earned and deserves?She is exquisite as well as talented. All hail Sarah Michelle!",The Grudge

And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot.

This is one spooky movie, mostly because the people involved are completely in the mercy of the ghosts. In America, the heroes would be looking for a solution, but in this one, they don't have much of a chance. That makes for a big difference.

It soon transpires that all is not well within those four walls, as the house harbours a violent secret.Director Takashi Shimizu's first foray into dealing with Hollywood is an admirable one, although there is a worrying familiarity with other recent US reworkings of Asian cinema, notably 'The Ring'. However, where that version succeeds due to the specific channelling of the evil, (ie, a videotape),'The Grudge' falls down due to the vague manner in which the spell manifests itself.That's not to say there are no redeeming features. 'The Grudge' has strong suspense and heart-stopping shocks throughout, but often there's a sense that they are contrived plot devices which contribute little towards the complete story.Gellar acquits herself as the frightened Westerner trying to unlock the origins of the curse, but it is young Yuya Ozeki who deserves a special mention for his sinister performance as 'Toshio'.A little derivative at times, 'The Grudge' nonetheless has numerous scary moments horror lovers will devour, but fans of the original should probably approach with caution.

I have to say it gave me goosebumps, but to me there really wasn't a good story. If you want to watch a scary movie, I'd recommend The Ring.Summary: I watched this movie twice and I'm still a bit confused on the story. It's something about if someone in Japan dies horribly, their spirit stays in that house killing anyone that interferes. People interfere and thats pretty much the storyline. Go watch for yourself if this interests you.Overall: This is a movie worth renting if you just want to get scared a little. I don't think it's worth buying. But I'll give it a 5/10.",The Grudge
343,dgar1948,"Comments on ""The Grudge""",10,4 September 2005,"I enjoyed this movie. One of the scariest movies I've seen in a while. I would not recommend young children to watch it late at night though. It could give them nightmares. What makes it scary is the way the ghost (Kayako Fuji) is presented. Those eyes. They stand out and certainly grab your attention. I would hate to encounter someone with that look in my house! I'd run right thru the wall. The little boy was kind of spooky too but not like Kayako. Sarah Michelle Gellar's fright is very believable. Who wouldn't be frightened? It was very well done I think, the ghost scenes, the setting. It was just a good movie. I would recommend it to friends or anyone who wants a good scare. The original version I would like to see too.",The Grudge
344,jpeterb701,Good Thriller,8,27 January 2006,"This movie was really scary. It kept me on the edge of my seat. It also had some good surprises in it. This house is more than haunted, its infested with demons.It was a bit hard to follow especially in the beginning, but once I figured out which were the flashbacks and which were the present it got easier.The part of the Japanese Police Detective could have been stronger, but all in all this movie was a spine-tingler. You'll find yourself throwing your popcorn over this one.The ending is pretty good to, a bit cliché but I don't want to spoil it for you. Go rent it!",The Grudge

I would just like to say that they could have done a much better job with this movie, it was really see such great talent put to waste!The movie was really slow and that leads to you laughing more than being scared almost makes you wonder if the genre for this movie should have been a comedy!",The Grudge
346,horrorforpresident,Why the senseless Buffy re-make? (no point),1,24 February 2008,"How come we have to re-make movies that were not hits, to try to make more money? I don't understand, why did The Grudge need to be made, again? Why? Anyway after the little remake hate speech I feel a little better. So The Grudge was horrible, stupid, and pointless. The wooden dialog and typical horror movie behavior made me want to hit my self with a 2 by 4. The story senseless, the acting horrid, the creatures, dumb and stupid looking, and most of all not scary. And isn't the point of a horror movie to be scared? Oh no it's just to make it a PG-13 movie so little 10 year old kids can see it, and then brag about it to 9 year old kids. Why can't we just get out of this PG-13 stage, and move on to more mature films? So the basic plot of The Grudge is that there's some typical curse invading the typical house, with the typical characters of any typical horror movie. Soon the characters begin to explore the house and learn about the curse, and then of coarse try to fight it, and that leads us to a, ah sequel. What!!!!! I'm not going through this garbage again, no way, no The Grudge 2 for me.Basiclly, if you like your typical Japanise horror you should enjoy your self, other than that, stay away, far away.

I went into the cinema expecting another 'Ring-type Thriller', but I got a taste of my own medicine; I was terrified! I don't know what it was about it that scared me: Maybe the grisly images, spooky story lines, the tension or the man sitting two seats away from me making funny noises! (I'm not joking!)Sarah Michelle G. IS a great actress, but put her screen time together and shes only in it for about half an hour - just as much as any other character, for example, Jennifer. She plays Karen, the Health visitor in Tokyo who's sent out to a spooky house. But, trapped inside is a curse which 'never forgives or never forgets!'

351,deadlypen,Pale & Flawed,4,10 March 2006,"This remake is a prime example of what happens when an intriguing story is compromised to accommodate the ego of a 'star' actor and a producer who figures that an American audience is unable to relate to anything that isn't connected to life as it is lived in the USA. I used to admire Sam Raimi and believe that he was gutsy enough to trust the public's intelligence - how times have changed! First of all the original plot lines are shifted to give more focus on the star and even scenes that rely upon a steady and sustained growth of anxiety are paced at a faster rate when compared to the original Ju-on movies. This harms the ambiance, but was presumably deemed necessary to make sure that the camera returned to Gellar all the quicker and to cut down the running time of the picture as a whole.The setting of the story - Japan - could be entirely dispensed with as far as the use made of it in the film goes. We are given western (that is to say American) characters whenever possible. Tokyo apparently even needs an American to run its social services department; Gellar is such an asset to him that she is accepted and pressed rapidly into service despite being without skills and unable to speak more than a few phrases of Japanese.The camera often stays xenophobically chained to the American actors. A Japanese security guard who is killed in the original movie (in a way that eerily advances the plot) just walks down a corridor and is never seen again in the remake. Some of the most memorable characters and sequences in 'Ju-on' were scrapped simply because they weren't good for Gellar or the other Americans. In a nutshell, a tale that worked well when told via an ensemble cast became threadbare and vapid when transformed into a star vehicle. Sarah Michelle Gellar simply did not have the talent, personality or gravitas to carry the story.Like George Raft (who was legendary for demanding script changes whenever he was afraid that his image might suffer), Gellar evidently wished her do-gooding volunteer character to be spotlessly presented. She has to have a boyfriend (to prevent suggestions that her character is abnormal, unattractive or a lesbian?). When she finds the ghostly boy apparently trapped in a cupboard, she reports his presence and makes sure to give the impression that she was caring enough to ask him to come downstairs with her...a statement that makes no sense given the boy's paranormal nature and her terrified reaction to his appearance.The star obviously didn't want an actor of any great depth or skill cast as her love interest. Jason Behr who plays that role is entirely superfluous to the plot; in fact, when his character was supposed to be asleep or unconscious, it was hard to notice any difference.The rewrites of Stephen Susco (aided and abetted by Sam Raimi's ad hoc changes during filming) tried to water down the disorienting shifts in time and continuity that are such an important feature of the Ju-on films. When it became plain that they had written themselves into a corner, spoon-fed explanations were inserted and characters began to make judgements that were worthy of a psychic hotline.Informed that one of the female players has disappeared, the detective in charge of the investigation immediately (without hesitation and to the exclusion of every other option) orders the collection of the security video tapes at her place of work - thus conveniently removing an obstacle erected by shoddy writing. Some scenes were shifted by as much as 57 minutes from the places they first occupied in Susco's treatment - this suggests cobbling a tangled mess together rather than inspired editing.Viewing the DVD with the cast and crew commentary switched on is a cringe-worthy experience. Time and time again, the actors and producer find much amusement in mocking Japanese customs and even the Shinto faith is described in sneering terms. There are also comments which show the extent to which the Director was pushed into artistic and technical changes by both Raimi and Gellar.I recommend that you avoid this lifeless clone and get the original Japanese movies - but opt for subtitles. The English dubbing, when available, is famously disconcerting - the accents (provided by an uninspired cast of British voice actors) are awful.",The Grudge
352,mlopezib8,At last a good remake,8,17 June 2008,"Normally, I have the opinion that remakes are pointless and boring. American industry usually takes original ideas and copies them just to make money. The results are, in most of the cases, absurd. I know many users and critics won't agree with me but this one is an exception. Not only for not being a bad movie but for being even superior to the original. One of the problems with Asian films in general is that they are slow to watch and full of long silences. This ""grudge"" fills in those ""empty"" spaces, as a clear Hollywood technique, and yet it respects the original one. Normally, remakes erase the backgrounds of original movies to locate them somewhere in America. But this one still happens in Japan and this time Americans are the foreign people who have to adapt and speak the language. It is so pleasant to see in this movie that every time that two Japanese characters get alone without foreign presence they speak their language instead of English with Japanese accent (why the hell would someone do that) like in Indiana Jones' or James Bond's movies. In this sense, it shows that, though with American production, the director is the same as the original one. And finally, another quality is that this version is less confusing than the Japanese film. Just this time, for making a remake with a total and logical respect of the culture they approach to, I give this grudge an 8.",The Grudge

When I first saw the movie, there was a NIKE commercial running on TV with different athletes, one was a Asian man and the picture was dark, I had to change the channel because it reminded me of the movie! I can sit through almost anything, but this one really got under my skin. You have to watch it alone, and in the dark to get the full extent. And just imagine it happening to you.

I watched this with my hubby and 13 year old daughter, having heard from a couple friends that it was scary. We all like scary, and it was rated PG-13 so okay to watch with our child. Frankly, after watching it, PG would've been a fine rating. As a ""scary"" movie, it fails to meet any criteria thereof. Slow moving, no suspense, and the ghosts are more hilarious than scary. My 13 year old was even bored, and kept pointing out the holes in the plot, which were like Swiss cheese. The only reason we didn't turn it off midway is that we all hoped it would pick up and get better. It didn't, right down to the oh so predictable ending. My daughter's final comment: ""how lame"".

357,WynneL,One of those lost opportunities to make a great horror film.,6,5 September 2005,"The three main problems with this movie: its presentation is too scattershot, it defies its own logic, and the characters are only marginally interesting.There are some really nice ghost moments. I watched this movie alone, and thus it freaked me out a little (and I eat horror for breakfast). Very nice sound, makeup, clothing, acting, etc. on the part of the dead. This was very well done, except perhaps for the sound the ghost made, which sounded like an everlasting belch. Seriously. It's like she couldn't end the burp and that's what killed her. Maybe if somebody slapped her on the back like she wanted then everything would be fine, I don't know.Surprisingly, Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't as convincing as normal. You just get the sense that she knew the material was weak and couldn't do anything much with it. Ted Raimi is marvelously adorable apparently without even trying. Bill Pullman ironically still has a friendly charm whilst looking as hollow and creepy as I've ever seen him. The girl who plays Yoko is both good and sympathetic. Pretty much all female actresses do a good job of seeming scared or scary. The little boy is quite perfect for his role. It's not the cast or the director that's the problem.Think of it this way: The Ring ended ten minutes after you expected it to, and that was a GOOD thing. The Grudge ends about five minutes after you expect it to, and this is a VERY BAD thing. Because five minutes ago, you had closure, some vague semblance of sense, slightly suspended disbelief, and a decent scene. Then it gets ruined. I really wish I'd stopped watching after that final object is thrown into a pool of liquid.The ""this is Japanese kabuki and it just operates differently"" defense doesn't work--BECAUSE THIS IS A REMAKE. It would have been so easy to keep the feel of the Japanese ghosts and still make SOME kind of sense within its own universe. That's all I ask, is that a movie make sense within its own universe. For example, I can kinda extrapolate the reason for catboy ghost existing, I can believe that a supernatural house can make someone see its past, but I can not see the reason for the last five minutes of the movie to even exist. It went from creepy-and-insensible-but-strangely-cleansing to utterly stupid.Bottom line, this movie is a lot of polish over a hollow shell. The reason it makes me so annoyed is that if it had presented a decent script and been less scattershot (not even necessarily chronological) so that we could at least sorta follow what the hell was going on, it could have been good.",The Grudge

But when I do watch one I'd like the tension to be like a roller-coaster ride, or better. I got spooked by 'the ring', also the second time. The Grudge, however, did not get me on the edge of my seat. Just sweaty hands of expecting something that didn't come. It has a few good scenes but nothing special.Most of all I missed some kind of explanation of why things are happening. Things don't fall into place. Could be only me, but I'd like to know why 'Karen' does not get killed immediately and why does that silent women at the beginning stay alive for so long, while others die almost immediately... It seems to me like it misses some extensions that were cut from the movie or something. Flashes of something you could not see clearly enough to spook you. Oh well...

The American version, directed by the same filmmaker, has done nothing towards clarifying the muddled story and, aside from the great opening sequences, is just a straight-forward recreation of the same suspenseful sequences that somehow don't play as well.

I know that most scary films are not going to be that realistic, but this film just went off on one. In every scary film there needs to be at least the essence of realism in it, however this film wasn't even close.I personally don't think this film is good at all, however, to some people I'm sure it is scary, I think that this film needs to be played by ear, if like me you are not easily frightened, by things that are just blatantly not real, then I would give it a miss.

I own the DVD and I LOVE that movie. The same goes for The Grudge...I knew right away from the previews that I wanted to see this movie...BAD! I'm sure you're familiar with Grudge's storyline: an American girl living in Japan goes to a house as caretaker of a woman who is so driven out of her mind, she barely ever talks. The house, once the scene of a violent crime, is haunted by a dead woman and her dead son. Now, here's where the flaws come in: while there are no hard and fast rules that can be applied to ghosts, it does kill the effect when the ghost repeatedly appears in a physical form and looking relatively normal (this refers to the little boy). It's even more dissuading when the ghost is shown coloring in a coloring book. At one point in the movie, he moves around and is touched and spoken to as if he were alive. It kinda hurts the whole ""ghost"" effect.However, the other ghost more than makes up for it, and the first half hour or so of the movie scared the living hell out of me. I think I jumped harder than I ever have before, and if you've seen it, you may be able to figure out which scene it is that gives viewers such a delightfully good scare. All in all, The Grudge is just what we need: a VERY good, VERY creepy ghost story that aims more for the psychological instead of trying to go for the gross-out. If you want the latter, rent a Freddy flick. (Although, it IS pretty creepy what happens to the original houseaid, a young Japanese girl). With that said, I gave The Grudge a rating of 8.

But then again I use ""The Exorcist"" as the paradigm of horror films by which all else are compared. Do yourself a favor and borrow this one from a friend if you must, otherwise avoid it altogether. SM Gellar doesn't have much of a chance to shine in this one, neither does Bill Pullman (or any of the ""main"" characters for that matter).

I can't really say how and avoid spoilers, but I will say this to validate my point: pay close attention to what is said about the actual cause or reasons for the grudge. Now ask yourself, who was it that was killing people? Does this even make sense? Drop any predispositions you may have had about the movie and seriously think about it. It's not that I didn't ""get"" the movie. The movie didn't even ""get"" itself. It takes liberties and makes assumptions that don't follow logically, because it is dependent on the American addiction to flashy effects and cheap scares. I will say that the opening credits were unbelievably cool, and there were one or two moments that were passingly frightening, but the Grudge's overall value as a movie is not very high.

I gave the film 9 because, despite being in my top 3 scariest films ever, the ending lacked the final push that has been the trademark of the director in films like The Ring.

CGI is understandable in most cases where a human cannot act in place of a certain fictional character, but I see the American film industry would rather crutch than do the homework. What made some great horrors so intimidating is that the creatures lurking about were not computer-generated stand-ins.I encourage everyone to watch the original ""Ju-on: The Grudge"", also recently released by Lions Gate Films ""Ju-on: The Grudge 2"".

House haunted by ghosts and killing whoever enters the house.The director,whoever it is,tried to convey three points to the world through this movie:1. Ghosts also have a lot of hair.2. Even a ghost's hair keeps falling if proper care is not taken towards it.3. Ghosts like bathtubs, spend much of the time there and may sometimes take bath in them.so be careful with tubs.This is what happens in the whole movie.Well, this may be a new concept to many.*****Funniest part in the movie, the ghosts in the movie show a live video to the Sarah Michelle when she goes to the house, to make her aware of their past.The only thing I felt new in this movie is,## people from the west being haunted by the ghosts of the east ##So guys avoid this movie if u want to see any horror movie.....and go for it if u want to have a comedy movie.I give 2/10.1 point for the cute little ghost boy in the movie and 1 point as a gift to the director.",The Grudge
374,wellyouknow55,America + Japan = Confusion,7,4 December 2009,"I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scary.What's interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew! I think this made the film... more Japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most Japan-to-America horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film. This worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond.The storyline was quite confusing as well. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. Also, I didn't think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story).Overall, there IS plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.",The Grudge

376,avalyn11,The only movie that has ever succeeded in frightening me,8,15 November 2004,"I like to think of myself as a steeled, seasoned horror movie buff. From the tameness of most of the mainstream films (Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, etc.) of the 1980s, to the exploding-zombies/eating-brains Italian fare of the 1970s, to the best/worst of what Japan had to offer since they adopted the horror movie into their cultural identity, I thought I'd seen it all, until I saw The Grudge.It's really no different than many other horror movies, in that it's really just a ghost story. However, it's told from a vastly different perspective, making a very significant departure from the tired ghost story genre. Though the score kind of spoils some of the scares in advance by getting too caught up in itself, every appearance of Toshio and Kayako made me practically jump out of my skin. No movie has ever actually scared me before, until this one did. Just the way Kayako moves, like a cross between a shambling zombie, a dying fish, and a river of hair, she continually appears to devour her victims (or at least scare them witless) in the most unsettling way imaginable. And the scary part is that there's really nothing unique about it; it just works.I have seen the ""Ju-On"" movies, and they were scary enough, but not enough to make me jump, probably due to their relatively modest budgets. However, the American remake of those movies, with an ample SFX budget, really does it justice. Kayako has gone from tight close-up/lots of makeup to fluid CGI movements, though director Shimizu does stick with the traditional approach at times, which is perhaps what drives the Kayako character, making her into a kind of ultimate movie villain, even though she has no lines and appears for the visual fright aspect only.If you haven't seen the Japanese ""Ju-On"" movies, you might want to do so before seeing The Grudge, if only to provide a bit more backstory than The Grudge can come up with. All in all, The Grudge is an excellent movie, far from a clumsy American remake of a well-done Japanese original. It's a good movie to see on a date, especially if you or your date scares easily. If you're like me, you'll be half-expecting Kayako to slither out from a closet, or Toshio to be peering up at you from underneath your desk, for weeks afterwards. I give it 4/5 stars, if only for the non-linear storytelling employed by director/writer Shimizu and cinematographers Ettlin and Yamamoto.",The Grudge
377,vardak,"One-trick pony. The same scare over and over, ad infinitum",4,1 December 2004,"I should admit that horror movies aren't my usual fare, and I don't see many in theater. A friend told me this was the scariest movie she had ever seen, and sheer curiosity led me to venture out and see it. I think my expectations were too high as to how scary it would be. The first real scare was slightly spoiled by previews and also by the fact that you could see the scare source faintly before it came fully into the light (which was probably intentional and would help the scare rather than hinder if you weren't searching so specifically for it as I was). Other than that, though, it was a truly creepy scene and a good scare. However, the rest of the movie is really nothing more than the same ""scary lady pops out unexpectedly"" over and over, which kind of defeats the scariness, in my opinion. Personally, I'm hoping something was lost in translation, and that the original wasn't also a one-trick pony like this one turned out to be.",The Grudge
378,lostdreamer,Scary movie..if it weren't for immature audiences,5,24 October 2004,"My biggest complaint about this film isn't about the movie itself, it's about the audience. I guess this is what occurs when a film is rated PG-13 and not R and the teenyboppers get let into an otherwise good film.I wasn't a big fan of ""The Ring"" and I don't get scared easily in a film. However, in this movie, there were plenty of moments when I was freaked out. The ghost/apparition kid was damn creepy. The music and sound effects were also well-used. The plot: There were major holes in the storyline and if you don't pay attention you may get confused. The ending was rushed and I was irritated that they didn't tie up a lot of the loose ends. Guess that's what we get when movies are steered towards teenagers and sequels.The acting was okay..not fantastic. Sarah Michelle Gellars character was underdone, which may have been done purposely, but nonetheless, it was played well. The movie had a rather artsy feel to it which was played up by the way it was filmed and edited. It may seem choppy or confusing to some, but it made sense in the long run. Here's my big complaint and why I can't review this film as well as I like. The audience in this movie had the IQ of a gnat. It started with the first scary moment in the movie where some jerks in the right side of the auditorium started laughing at an inappropriate moment. They kept doing it whenever something scary would occur, when one of the characters were Japanese and walked onto the scene, when a Japanese person would speak, when the music would get creepy - basically whenever an inappropriate time to laugh would be, they laughed. It totally killed the effect of the movie and made an otherwise good film, do poorly in my opinion. I found out that this occurs with all of the viewings of this film and apparently it happens with many PG-13 horror movies. I saw ""The Ring"" on DVD and didn't have to worry about an audience, and I should've taken the same route with this film. I think directors should be more concerned with making a good film with an R rating than taming it down just enough to become PG-13 so that trashy people and teeny-boppers can give them grosses. This film would've done well if it was an R rated film. In fact, I think it would probably do better if it were an R rated film.My recommendation: Wait until the crowds die out before watching this movie or watch it on DVD. It's a good film and don't let other people ruin it totally for you.",The Grudge

The plot is very straight forward and simple: ""Everybody who sets foot in a haunting house is going to get killed."" And that's about it. Don't go looking for a deeper meaning or strange plot twists, because there are none.

Well the beginning was, we were the only people in the theater laughing when the guy fell off the ledge. I mean then he came back to life! I'm sorry but this is a hard movie to follow if you don't watch closely, and it's scary so you don't want to watch some parts. How did the creepy girl get out of the house to chase the sister? That confused me. I think too many people died in the same way: walking down a empty hallway where a strange noise was coming from. How thick are these people? Following a strange noise alone? It's really funny to see the people at the theater scraming i was laughing so hard when my friend was screaming. But if you like to get scared you should watch this movie, or if you like to see other people get scared. I don't think I'll go to see the sequel. This movie wouldn't be scary in the daytime though. The plot wasn't that good, but not many scary movies have good plots. I give this movie 5 out of 10, because it's scary but doesn't have a plot or reason they all die.

385,beamerm3,As forgettable as they come,3,3 February 2005,"There was nothing worth noting in this film, and no reason to go out of your way to see it.In order for a horror movie to work it needs at least one of the following: 1) Actual scares. 2) Gore/interesting deaths. 3) Characters you either fear for or identify with. 4) Interesting sets. 5) Tension as to what characters will live and what will die.This film had none of the above. There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character. You know immediately who will be left standing in the final moments, and therefore never feel tension when anyone is in trouble - you already know the outcome.The movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child. It doesn't last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it's pure humor. And you'll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn't stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the ""surprise"" in the end. Why didn't it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*A movie with a decent concept but terrible, dull, and mindless execution.

The only draw backs were that it was pretty predictable and that the performances weren't particularly memorable. Gellar's role was down right forgettable.

388,pmreddick,"Not Extremely Scary, but Still a Good Movie",9,2 July 2005,"I have seen both the regular version and the unrated directors cut. First of all, If you are going to watch this movie then do yourself a favor and see the directors' cut version.The Grudge is a remake of the Japanese movie ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", both versions of the film were directed by the same man, marking the first time that an American remake of a Japanese movie was directed by the same person. The Grude tells the tale of a house in Japan. Everyone who enters this house ends up dead not too long afterward, simple enough. They are killed by the two ""ghosts"", a mother and her son, who were murdered in the house. Most American movies that involve haunted houses and ghosts have their killings limited to a certain range (such as the haunted house) in The Grudge the two ""ghosts"" are not retained by any limits they can strike anywhere at anytime. Another difference between most American horror movies is that the person who is killed is usually guilty of something, in The Grudge all that the victims have done is simply enter the wrong house at the wrong time.Sarah Michelle Gellar does a pretty good job as do the rest of the actors, the only standout is by a Japanese actor, who plays the part of the lead detective investigating the house.The story is told a a good pace and the backstory of who the ""ghosts"" are and why they are is explained pretty well.

Not only because of all the Japanese only talk going on, but also because this obviously is a very alien situation, that the movie characters has found themselves in.In this movie we have a Sarah Michelle Gellar, that has distanced herself from her usual Buffy character, and actually demonstrates that she can act also as not being a Vampire Slayer.The scares are, if not all too original, enough to make you choke on your midnight drink, and I don't think you should watch this movie alone.",The Grudge

This curse follows the individual until they die.The Grudge is supposedly made shot for shot with the Japense version. To jump to my summary, the film does a terrific job in building suspense and making you feel incredibly uneasy. The sound effects are great! While the plot doesn't make entirely too much sense, it's believable, for the moment.Karen (a very convincing Sarah Michelle Gellar, I'm no Buffy fan) is a transplant to Japan. She lives there with her boyfriend. Karen attends a local university and does community work for experience. Her work is helping housebound elders. Karen helps an elderly woman who is frightened by a mysterious force (the curse).

After the opening to the movie the plot only gets better with the blinding suspense & intertwined stories that keep you wandering until the every end where it all meets together.The acting for this film is not the greatest there could be, but i think Sarah Michelle pulls her role off quite well. Aside from the acting, the plot is very good because it never really just jumps out and says what's going on in the film, and that is why I like it, because it keeps you guessing and surprised but at the same time very entertained. I must admit the movie itself is not very horrifying the way it is presented but the very dark & strange atmosphere is what does it for me, making the story seem far more terrifying than ever.Overall, this film is no ""Oscar Contender"" but it delivers what is expected of a Hollywood horror film, with an even darker setting which emphasized the scare effect, and is very good for what it is.Final Grade:: 8/10 \ B+",The Grudge

The acting can be a little underwhelming at times but the script, and style of the film more than make up for it. Like ""The Sixth Sense"" this movie does not rely on blood and gore to achieve it's scares, but instead uses more subtle psychological scares.

The Ring would have been great if not for the ending. But we're not talking about The Ring, we're talking about The Grudge.

A man murdered his wife and child in his house and the emotions stil inhabit the home. Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) works for a nursing home and visits the house frequently. Everyone who enters this house winds up dead. The wife and child who were murdered are the main spooks in this film. The little boy doesn't do much but is quite terrifying. The woman is the one that causes people to die. I'm sure anyone could compare the two movies (The Grudge and The Ring) and make a list of how the two are alike, from the girl messing with the security cameras, to the bathtub scenes and flooding water.

The first film introduced us to the story and was set and shot in Tokyo and stared Sarah Michelle Geller of Buffy fame. Fans of the original Japanese films would have probably found the Hollywood versions a little watered down, but for the likes of me, who had never seen the Japanese versions, I watched them not expecting anything but a horror film. The second film opened the story up a little further and answered a few questions that remained unanswered in the first.

It becomes way too predictable. You already know what's going to happen. And on top of that, when the remade scene is finally shown, it's not as good as the original because the atmosphere is all missing. Instead, it's only a scary face scaring the audience.

The story is absolutely uninteresting, and the underlying premise is cliché (a house is haunted by the spirits of a family that ended in a murder/suicide type of affair). Even as simple as the story may be, it still doesn't even really make sense, like in the way the characters are connected. What you really get from this movie are two things: exposition and scare tactics; when you're not seeing one, you're seeing the other. So, there's nothing really interesting about the story; it barely makes sense. We're left with just a bag of scary cinema tricks. Nothing better than you're typical B-movie.",The Grudge
404,silverbuggy27,Scary at times but utterly pointless,4,13 August 2005,"The ambiance is there, and the movie does offer some good scares, but all in all it is flat and uneven. There are some great performances, Kadee Strickland's Susan stands out, but overall the movie doesn't offer enough backdrop in the characters' lives to actually care about them. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a good scream queen, and poised to take the title away from Jamie Lee Curtis any year now, after all she stole the spotlight in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. In the end, I felt ripped off of a story, there seems to be no story what-so-ever and the thought of getting a sequel on the way is just stupid, it didn't work for The Ring (which was actually one of the best horror movies to come out of the last decade) why should it work for a knock off?",The Grudge
405,viciousjeremy,This movie scares me,10,31 January 2005,"I was watching The Grudge this past weekend while I was drunk and stoned with my cousins! When I first saw it, it was at the theater and I didn't find it scary or anything. The audience,however, kept screaming the whole way through. I told the audience to shut up. This past weekend though, I was so captivated by that one scene with Bill Pullman scared like hell in his house and finding the boy curled up like a ball. Ted Raimi's death scene was possibly the best part. Ted slipping by the stares was so startling I couldn't resist. No other horror movie I've seen in the past has been scary except this one.

I guess it was the little kid screaming like a cat that hooked me. Well the movie just isn't scary. You've seen it all before, and done better in other movies. The non-linear style of story telling has been done better by others. It's pretty funny how the movie jumps around trying to explain how we go from point a to point b, sadly by the time you get to point b you just say ""huh?""My wife and I saw ""The Forgotten"" 10 minutes after seeing ""The Grudge"".

This movie lacks suspense, creativity, and scary scenes. It is a horror movie that is not scary at all. A ghost boy opens his mouth and meows like a pet cat, creepy. A ghost girl makes sounds like she is clearing her throat, spine tingling. An old lady, who is also supposed to be creepy, says nothing the whole time she is in the film. She supposed to be frightening and mysterious with red circles around her eyes, but she simply comes across as stupid and annoying. I want my hour and a half back of my life I wasted watching this film. Why did Bill Pullman kill himself in the beginning??? Why did the police detective try to help the ghost boy when he knew ghosts were in the house. Why did this movie ever get made??? How did some of the viewers enjoy this???",The Grudge
408,anti-nickname,"Scary images, but weak plot",4,25 October 2004,"The Grudge provided a very nice cheap thrill- the images were frightening, and the surprises were apt to make the audience jump. However, the lack of a decent story completely ruined this film for me. It's relatively easy to scary an audience with creepy images and sounds, but the way that these things will stay with the audience is if there is a convincing plot line. It needed to be cemented with a good story. There were too many plot holes, plus the fact that the story in itself was pretty weak, to make this a long-lasting impact. Also, I felt that much of the scary images were taken from The Ring and Ringu, so it wasn't very original for me.",The Grudge

The characters seemed really stupid and a lot of the stuff they did made no sense. I know that's to be expected in this type of movie , but this was ridiculous! The ending was kind of predictable as well. A lot of the ""scares"" in this were just silly. You could see most of them coming a mile away. I jumped once in the whole entire movie and that was at a part where they just threw one in at a very random time. The FX were OK, but they weren't anything outstanding. The acting was about what you would expect from this kind of movie. Overall I think it was a pretty poor excuse for a thriller.

Its a fun thing to do because the film is always a 'Sneak' not yet on release film in Austria. Its also a surprise movie, so no-one knows what they are going to get till the curtain goes up. This is fine because it forces me to watch films I would never usually see out of choice. As always, the 'Sneak' was well attended with a starting audience of about 150. I was a bit doubt full about the film from the kick off, I mean, a lot of Japanese names on the opening credits and some non Japanese actors I never heard of... but I figured lets hang in and see what happens... Ten minutes into the movie, after a great deal of audience laughter the exodus started... twos and threes to start with then a steady flow with me almost wondering if there might be a fire back there when they found the jawbone in the roof space. As the final credits rolled a glanced over my shoulder (I like to sit in the front) and to my amazement saw that there were just 3 of us left! Thats right.. 3! I mean the move was bad... very bad.. but never in 40 years of regular movie going had I experienced anything like this. I found the effects passable at best, the direction a joke, the acting wooden and the script writer should do the honourable thing and fall on his sword... by the way.. if you saw the movie... don't you think the monster with the long lack hair and white skin looked familiar?

Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US.

For the reason that The Grudge scared the hell out of me.However there are other reasons that I wont watch it again aside from being scared senseless. I also didn't like it, I think mainly because I couldn't understand it and even though the plot deals with a lot of back story there are no real answers to questions about what happened to get all of this started in the first place or why these evil murderous spirits came into being.Kayako(the female spirit) SHE WAS SCARY, there was nothing about her that wasn't scary from the way she looked and the way she moved to the sound she made....SHE WAS FREAKEN SCARY. I have the understanding that there was no computerized special effects that was used with her and that the actress the played her actually moved and acted that way, she is a talented actress.Toshio(the little boy spirit)If anything I either found him funny or annoying depending on what it was he was doing. First of all I was more than a little confused on what his part in the whole thing actually was and he really didn't seem to do much of anything except be creepy. The thing that I found funny about him is that he yowled like a cat and even as I was watching the movie I had visions of what might happen if someone were to dangle a string in front of him or let a wind up mouse loose.I also found the story itself confusing, one premise of the movie was that if you did whatever it was you did to incur these spirits wrath(not going to say what that was for those that haven't seen The Grudge) they were going to get you and there was no way out of that but then there were people in the movie that got out of it but it was never explained how or what they did to get out of it.Usually in movies(certainly in this genre)there are things that happen during the early scenes that have you asking ""What is with that?"" and usually somewhere in the course of the movie those questions are answered but The Grudge answers nothing and leaves you with more questions at the end of the film than you had when you started watching it.The Grudge is scary as hell thats for sure but other than that its not a very satisfying movie, its lack of answers, confusing storyline, characters and pace setting leaves more than a little to be desired.",The Grudge

Sarah Michelle Gellar might find it hard to get work after this project and its sequel. Another thing that was funny, when the kid opens his mouth, he meows.

The Grudge was is no better than a ghost story told at an elementary school sleep-over. What an unintendedly comedic flop. The spirits in the movie were not ""caught in the grip of a powerful rage,"" as the previews suggested. They were simply caught in a failing, floundering film that sank like the Titanic.

I was so exited after watching The Grudge, I thought I should write a review on this. It is a great horror movie. It has got most of the stuff that needed to make a good horror movie. I agree that it doesn't have a good story, it has a paper thin plot but what it has is a pure horror that doesn't depend on any story at all. If this movie has got a great story to back it up then I think it might be the best horror movie of all time.One thing I really want to say here that this movie is heavily depends on some horror movie clichés, like sudden jump scenes, character following the strange noise that came from the dark corner of the house. But that actually is the plus point of this movie. They have presented in such a good way that it creates such a spooky atmosphere in the movie.If you want to really enjoy this gem of a horror then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation.

The make up and sound effects were good but the acting was so-so.I also would like to ask (not to sound like a racist) but what is up with Japanese movie makers and having really brutal ways of killing family members in their movies?!?! In the Ring she kills her daughter and in this movie it's an entire family.

The little bit of ""Horror"" that I've seen hasn't really scared me.I did see The Ring and I thought it was pretty well done, freaky, twisted, and spooky. But it didn't scare me or fill me with terror.The Grudge didn't either, but I can easily see how it would.As opposed to The Ring, which was built more around terror and a storyline, The Grudge is largely a series of jump sequences and shock-factor shots. Some are extremely cliché, others will catch you totally by surprise. If you like a movie that scares through these tatics than you should enjoy The Grudge.If you like the way The Ring scares you, you'll be disappointed. This isn't a slow-paced terror flick. This is a Halloween fright-fest.And it definitely has it's share of haunting images...The story is crap and the characters are crap. The setting isn't very good and it feels very familiar to other movies and shows. It has its similarities to The Ring but the average watcher won't notice them.If none of the above bothers you, go for it. It's a fun little film that might get you the spooks. If you are a big horror buff, I would say it's worth a matinée (sp?) just to see a few of the cooler and more unique parts.I would give it a 5/10, and that is being generous, but that's because I'm not a big horror fan.

431,dragon_mistress9,Don't bash this movie! *major spoilers*,7,24 October 2004,"I repeat, *major spoilers*. The Grudge is a remake of a Japanese horror movie (Ju-on, Ju-on 2: The Grudge). Its goal is to give people chills, which I think it achieves.Sarah Michelle Gellar is an American nurse moved to Tokyo, Japan with her boyfriend, Doug (Jason Behr), and is chosen to take care of a batty old woman named Emma after her other caretaker, Yoko, has mysteriously not shown up for work. The audience knows what has happened to dear Yoko, but the cast in the film haven't the brains to figure it out. I guess they actually have to find her body before they put two and two together!The Grudge is told in two separate stories; one is the story of the Williams family (consisting of Matthew, wife Jennifer, Matthew's Sister Susan, and Matthew's Mother Emma) moving into the house which we know to be haunted/cursed. The other is the story of Sarah Michelle Gellar taking care of Emma, the last member of the Williams family, after the rest of the family has disappeared. Again, we know what has happened, but apparently the police need bodies to figure out that they're dead.The first clue that there is something suspicious in that house is, of course, when Yoko goes up into the attic and is murdered by a freakish-looking female ghost in the shadows. I might add I jumped out of my skin the first time I saw that ghost. Hehheh, hehAfter Yoko dies, Karen (Gellar), steps in. She feels something weird in the house, and hears strange noises. She goes to investigate, and finds a young boy, Toshio (creepy Yuya Ozeki), and his black cat taped inside of a closet. If you think that's weird, keep reading!After Karen calls for help, she finds Emma curled up on her futon talking to something that isn't there. That has scary written all over it, right?The ghost makes her second appearance, this time in front of Emma and Karen. What does she want? Is she after someone in particular?Afterwards, Karen goes investigating about Toshio and his family via the web. Ah, where would we be without technology? It turns out Toshio has been cutting his Mom's face out of every picture. What strange behavior! And what's this? He likes to meow like a cat and murder people, too? Well, that's just the icing on the cake!Yes, it seems our little Toshio lured Jennifer Williams into a bedroom one evening, scaring her half-to-death. When Matthew came home to check up on her, scared both of them fully-to-death. Interesting hobbies this young boy has. I wonder if all Japanese boys act like that.Matthew's sister Susan had left a message on his answering machine, and when we flash over to her at her workplace, she starts to get worried as he hasn't called back yet. Susan then proceeds down to the stairwell where Matthew phones her. Hey; isn't Matthew dead?This is where very creepy noises from the ghostly girl come in over the phone.Susan hangs up. She continues to hear the noises, only this time, they're louder. They're close by. Ack. The lights flicker. ACK. The ghostly figure starts up the stairs towards her. ACK!Susan runs back to her hotel, and she takes the elevator up to her room. On the elevator next to her is Toshio, of course, but she doesn't notice because her eyes are conveniently closed from being so relieved she got back safely. Right. Sure you did, Susan.Susan gets another phone call. This time it really is Matthew. What?! Matthew's dead, dammit! This isn't real! Only we know that, though. She doesn't.Until she buzzes him in and the door rings not but two seconds later. When she answers it, no one's there. The noises on the phone start up again, and she smashes the phone. Sorry, Susan, butbye-bye!Anyhow, now that the police can't get any answer from Susan, and now that the police have figured out that Jennifer and Matthew are dead along with a strange piece of a body on the ground in the attic with them, what are they to do? Search her apartment and find nothing there.When Nakagawa-san figures out that whoever goes into that house becomes a target of the ghost, he returns to the house to try and burn it down. However, not being too bright, he investigates the crying he hears once in the building. Stupid Nakagawa-san!Return of the cat boy, Toshio! Nakagawa-san was afraid Toshio was a poor boy drowning. Oh, boybye-bye, Nakagawa-san. Toshio so elegantly drowns him instead.Karen goes to Peter's (Pullman) house to talk to his wife about his suicide. She looks at old photographs and discovers that in every single picture, the then-alive ghostly figure appears in them. She has to find out who she is and what she wants.When Karen returns home, she finds out that her boyfriend has gone to the house. No! If he goes there, he'll be a target, too! So, of course, she goes after him.The next scenes are frightening as they are told as flashbacks relayed through the present. Karen sees Peter talking to Toshio about his Mom, and then sees him looking through pictures of his Mom. His Mom is the ghostly figure. And her husband murdered her.When Peter opens the closet with all of the pictures on it, the corpse of Kayako Saeki.When Karen finds Doug, Kayako is still haunting them, and crawls very creepily down the stairs towards them. Unfortunately, Doug seems to be paralyzed, and Karen isn't heartless enough to leave him behind, so they're both stuck there awaiting Kayako's ghost to do something terrifying to them.Karen eventually sets out to do what Nakagawa-san couldn't, and sets the whole place on fire.

First, the whole movie is set in Japan which is a nice change from the usual ""all American cities"" in which these movies are made; Second, most people have no knowledge of the Japenese horror genre, their culture and what scares them, this movie is one of thescariest thing i have seen in a while, you have to understand the culture behind such a film before you can say that it ""sucks""...Those who enjoy seeing a rotting Jason, who has been killed a million times over, rip people's heads off or stab them, or cut their throats open, should keep watching such films, and leave movies like this one alone.only downside to this screening: Hollywood made a sequel to the ring...",The Grudge
433,cacin2000,One of the worst films of 2004...,2,25 October 2004,"I had heard about THE GRUDGE in June of this summer. I was very excited to see it because I haven't had a good scare since...awhile. Although, I was a little skeptical as to whether it was just following in the footsteps of THE RING, which I enjoyed, and was just relying on the sudden hype about Japanese horror films to initiate its box office rather than containing an actual decent plot, craft, and performances. And you know what? My skepticism was correct. THE GRUDGE, in my opinion, is one of the worst films of the year. One of the main reasons it was so bad is that it is absolutely degrading to the original film in just its existence, and the fact it was advertised and promoted so well with complete deception. The plot, to begin, made sense, within its own context, but externally left many wholes involving the question of WHY? and SO WHAT? Ultimately, it was a very weak basis to deliver any scares, which leads me to my next point. There are no scares! I was absolutely disappointed with the lack of tension, and terror because there was none of it. There wasn't one moment where I felt scared or even jumped at the ridiculous, formulaic attempts to jolt you.The performances? Let me just say this... The best performance is from Bill Pullman who dies in the first five minutes (that shouldn't be considered a spoiler since it happens in the very beginning). It is probably the most shocking moment of the whole movie, actually it is. Not in the fact that it happens but more the way it happens. For the rest of the film, I envied his character. What I wouldn't give to be lying on the ground, dead, instead of having to watch this film. Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance was ridiculous and nothing short of. Actually, no other performances should be mentioned; they're all more horrifying than the film itself.To top it off, the directional skill is sloppy and seems incoherent. I was shocked to find that the same director of Ju-On participated in this film. There was nothing creative, nothing different, and nothing good. Pretty much summing up the entire quality of the film, which is structured in a senseless manner, exposing the stupidity of Americans who walked towards the sounds rather than run from them. By the way, I'm really curious as to why most of the characters are American, and if they're not, they still speak English most of the time. The film takes place in Tokyo! It makes me so livid just thinking about how BAD it is. Overall, the film lacks any sense, any scares, and any cause for care, making it one of the worst movies I have seen all year, and I've seen a lot!

The movie is based upon a legend that if you die in a great rage, you will haunt the place you died in. People start disappearing in from this house in Tokyo and the police are investigating. That is the premise of this movie. I saw this with my Girlfriend and she was terrified. All throughout the movie She was holding on to me. I was sitting bored, watching a movie with plot holes, not so good acting, and a premise that was sub par. Then I was confused, the credits rolled, and the lights turned on. Could the movie be over? It couldn't be. I looked around for other confused souls, and sure enough, a man behind me said ""That was retarded"" I turned to him and said thank you.I want my 2 hours back Takashi Shimizu!!!! Frankly, this movie had no redeeming qualities. If it was scary, then where was my suspense. If it was good acting then why do I want to shoot myself to end my boredom? Bill Pullman had a screen time for all of 5 mins. SMG, while I do love her, could not save this movie.

435,John-Woo,Lights off. Snuggle up to your blanket. Open your mind for this ride! Highly recommended!!,10,26 October 2008,"People really need to ""get"" into it to experience the desired effect. They need to learn how to truly become one with the film while viewing, to absorb the tension and allow the film and atmosphere to ""take"" you there. They need to open up to a film and ""allow"" themselves to be scared, to allow the movie to show you whats its really got. That means, lights off, talking to a minimum, good sound, preferably late at night, freeing your mind of thought to allow the film to effectively and properly portray its vision, imagery, tension, ambiance, atmosphere, story etc.I cant stand people who seemingly on purpose dismiss these general rules of thumb and put up a shield of armor to stop the film/films from achieving what they set out to do, and yet they think they can justifiably say it wasn't scary. I think many people do this because they believe its cool to not be scared of a film, or are afraid there friends will say something like ""Ah your a sissy, that wasn't scary!"" Don't get me wrong, i'm sure for some reasons, certain films just don't get to certain people, but all to often, it seems more often than not, people fall into this irritating category. Fear can quite easily be avoided consciously and sub-consciously by closing your mind whether intentional or unintentional and by not setting yourself up with the proper atmosphere. Open up to a film! Let the film show YOU what its got, instead of showing the film what you can avoid.I don't care what anyone says: this film is a work of genius laced with an imagination that goes far and beyond what most could even possibly begin to think up. The directing style was original and the story was told with enough to get you up to date with whats going on but with enough left out to keep the mystery alive and to keep you thinking. The imagery was truly astounding. I could go on but ill just say, yes, to me and most i know, it was scary as hell!! I would not watch it by myself, but i recommend it if you really wanna ""fun"" ride! :) Overall: Awesome, i loved it! My 2cents.",The Grudge
436,azrael29a,The Best Horror Movie I've seen,10,17 January 2005,"I'm writing this after seeing The Grudge on multiple times. I must say I've seen it first in a Sunday morning at 3am, and I must say that, since that fateful morning, like 3 weeks ago, I've remained paranoid of dark corners in my room. The movie is about an American couple that moved in Japan for study. They are confronted with a ""slight"" problem when Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) fills in for Yoko from the Social Care Center she was working for. She unwittingly steps into a cursed house that holds dark secrets. The movie is a frightfest that reaches in the depths of your mind as sure as a surgeon's blade cuts on the line, leaving you so much as 2 minutes of ""breath-catching"" time. Very nicely made, the actors have been up to my expectations, and the ""badguy"" is the scariest thing to be caught on camera... I've had a perverse pleasure after viewing the movie, in the sense that I swore to god I wouldn't watch another movie if they'll come out with a sequel...but I enjoyed the experience it provided; it's not that I'm a scaredy cat... it's just that I'm afraid I won't live through it.

It was exactly as I thought (and feared) it would be; Ju-On 1, 2 (and even small parts of the less successful-straight-to-video-prequels) were used to make this nice and easy to digest for the western viewer. I do not blame the director though, the most common used comment on ""Ju-On"" by the western viewers wás that they never understood a d*mn thing of the movie because there were too many flash-backs. And so, they make it chronological and easy to watch, throw in some ""scary"" moments, cut out the things that made the movie really SCARY in the first place and PRESTO, more raving reviews than the originals ever got. Mr. Shimizu probably wanted to re-do this movie on a bigger budget, but it would have been appreciated by me (and a lot of people I know) if some of the edginess would have been saved in this remake instead of fancy rendering/ animation.

It's good for some suspense and screams in the theater, and it had my wife (and a friend's date) hiding under their coats for most of the movie.Nothing here that has not been done already, but it is a clean fun horror movie that probably works better in the theaters. Don't expect a great ending, and don't expect deep character development and you will have a good time.Sound and image quality were good, and some of the suspense scenes are right up there.

This film is proof that what is scary isn't necessarily gore and guts and boogymen per se, but rather one can be scared by reaching into the mind's repository of fears. It was nice to see Sara Michelle Gellar break out of the Buffy persona and take on a different character for a change. Jason Behr is sexier than ever as Doug. I sincerely hope that a sequel is being considered, since this move was part of a series in Japan. Oh-- and that creepy sound scares the hell out of me.",The Grudge

It turns out that a crime has been committed in that very house three years ago and there's a Japanese saying that whenever someone dies in a rage this victim will come back with a vengeance and kill everyone who enters the house in the same rage.Though it's easy to see that Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the main character she never gets interesting (besides her looks of course).

The woman and the little boy haunts the house and kills everyone who comes in contact with it. The film acts out three years after the murder and an American man lives in the house with his wife and mother, there is also a woman named Yoko, who helps out with the mother. When Yoko goes missing, Karen(Sarah Michelle Gellar) get's to substitute for her, and she goes to the house to care for the mother (Emma). Karen finds a scarred boy in a closet, she doesn't know that the boy has been murdered three years earlier. She calls her boss and tells him about it. She goes in to check on Emma who is lying down staring. Karen looks in the direction Emma is and she sees something really creepy. When her boss comes to the house Karen is sitting shaking in a corner, Emma is dead and they also find Emmas son and his wife in the attic - DEAD. It goes from there.. with a lot of death and other scary things. Karen discovers why they were murdered, and finds out that since she's been in contact with the house she is in a real danger zone. Sarah Michelle does a great job acting scarred and I give a lot of credit to the Japanese film makers. They really know how to give you nightmares (remember the ring?)

443,Willtur,Good Simple Horror,6,6 November 2004,"I love it how most people here claim to be big time horror fans but never venture out any further than some retarded sequel to Jeepers Creepers or something like that. I think if your going to rank on a film but down at least 3 points of references of films that you actually thought were good before you act like you have a valid point. I myself, am obsessed with horror films. I watch them all and 95% aren't worth it. For anyone to say they are bigtime horror fans you would have to venture out to foreign cinema since right now there really isn't anything good coming out of the US lately.Anyone that goes to ""the ring"" references really doesn't know Asian horror. Even in the movie Kwaidan long black hair has its place which was made ages ago. Its always been associated with decay and death and is pretty creepy in itself. Any movie that uses it is not automatically a rip off. Most people associate The Ring with this film since its probably the only two Japanese born films they have seen and the fact that unlike most horror they use technology as tool. Most Asian horrors have that formula some can be called rehash but others have their own places. I don't think these two films are alike as much as the movie ""Phone"" or ""One Missed Call""( both OK films btw) have ring similarities. I don't think The Ring was as good as Ringu even after seeing The Ring first. I think with horror you have to weigh the pros and cons and see if your happy with it after the fact.The original theatrical release of Ju-on was nothing special in the lines of plot and pissed me off at the end but I still liked it. My girlfriend wouldn't go anywhere upstairs without me and the second film I think she screamed for a minute straight from Ju-on 2: The Grude. Just like ""The Blair Witch"" it effects people differently. For people who have seen any version of this film before your going to be jaded since any version you see first is going to be the scariest or what have you. I don't think you can compare it when you have a remake which half@ssly combines the TV and Theatrical Japanese versions yet still manages to be confusing. I don't think it had the umph but I do think it has its own niche with people who haven't seen it since it is better that most of the crap out there.

Sam Raimi has done quite a good job at intertwining the original movie (ju on) with this version. It is unusual-- especially for such a mainstream horror blockbuster, the Grudge does a good job representing or at least putting Japan out there as a trendy one of Hollywood's source for scary movies these days. As for the Grudge vs. the Ring... Definitely, the Grudge would be my pick.

The noise that the ghost makes is quite disturbing, but apart from that it hardly gave me a scare. I thought the Ring was better at the crucial moments.SPOILERS: The first bit where Yoko encounters the woman in the attic- i thought that was a pretty crap moment- the makeup on the woman was really bad. Some of the scenes weren't subtle enough- it was too 'in your face'. i like it better when there's more suspense and less confrontation, as in monster lurking around... blah blah. I hate actually seeing the 'evilness' because it no longer has an element of suspense, and the grudge is like that.

I definitely wanted to see the movie cause I really enjoy horror films even though they scare me to death.This on the other hand, didn't. I watched this quite easily and I didn't even have to hide behind our couch and that is saying a lot, trust me. Sure, Kayako is pretty creepy and all but I didn't get the feeling which I usually have when I watch a horror film - the chills and all. My expectations were pretty high, I admit it, but still, it needed something more to be actually scary.I did like watching this film nevertheless - all at least it wasn't wasted time that I used.

Therefore watching a horror film, I primarily want to be scared. The Grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. I've been a horror film fan for many years, and I'm talking about the masters such as Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days.

The Ring was the first (in terms of popular American movies/remakes) of its genre, and it achieved a level of suspense, mixed with equal amounts of originality, and intrigue. On the other hand, The Grudge is nothing more than a few highly predictable startling scenes and a bunch of rip offs from The Ring. Feel free to go about your normal routine with this movie playing in the background - nothing you'd miss could be critical to the plot, since there really isn't a plot at all.If you're considering renting or buying this, save your money.

I was actually so freaked I screamed at the top of my lungs at the beginning when Yoko was in the attic. This probably is the scariest movie I have ever seen it is a lot scarier then the ring. Most of the top rated horror movies in North America today started in a Japanese or Chinese theatre. Such movies as the ring and the grudge.

456,the81kid,"Good, but why all the remakes?",4,27 March 2005,"The Grudge is a spooky film, and mostly free of those cliché 'turn around, he's behind you!' shots. In short, its scary and moody and is a good horror film. Its just not exceptional. And its not helped my a few points...Sarah Michelle Gellar is, I'm afraid, pretty wooden. I wouldn't make a big point of this, but she is the main character, and you are supposed to empathise with her. She does cry, look worried and look afraid, but (in my honest opinion) she always appears to be 'acting' and never really 'being'. There seem to be many people who disagree with me on this, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I think its because most of these people are Buffy fans, and so, SMG can do no wrong. She's always appears likable, but never believable. (Personally, I find this really annoying now, because she is the same in everything, yet still gets picked to star in film/TV shows, despite being very lacking in the acting department.) I fear she was picked for her fan base (her looks don't hurt either), and certainly not her ability.There is, however, some good acting to compensate. Bill Pullman is good, even though he doesn't have much screen time to work with. And the actor playing the Japanese detective (I don't remember his name) was especially good in the scene watching the security camera tapes. He looks truly uncomfortable/petrified. His eyes do all the talking, and he doesn't succumb to (*cough* Sarah Michelle Gellar *cough*) being forced to cry, quiver his lips, or go all goo-goo eyed.Another slight bug with this film: it looks like the American version of Japan. All the main characters (with only 3 exceptions) are American! What? There were over a dozen Americans leads, yet only 3 Japanese characters! IN THE MIDDLE OF TOKYO!!! Every other job shown in the film was occupied by an American! In the film's defence, there was a reason given for all of these, but still... Again, I don't want to write a sociological essay on this point, but it did strike me as beyond suspension of disbelief and more than a little patronising to the targeted American audience.I haven't seen the original yet, but I would like to now, just to see if this was an improvement (although I doubt it).

Some scenes made the movie look cheap, as half of the stuff could be easily reproduced in your own home. Only two scenes off the top of my head were really clever and got me startled. The story itself was pretty well thought out. I enjoy the time frame jump around. Seeing different time periods throughout the movie, piecing together what happened and what is going on. However, the ending was terrible! If you really thought about it as deeply as I did, the ending made no sense.

The house is different, but only slightly so. More care is taken to explain Japanese culture for those new to it.

ACTUAL SCARY BITS. possibly its just because you have to actively watch the film in the Japanese version due to the subtitles but they know how to hold you in suspense, whereas the American version made me laugh or go talk to my mates on my phone, make a cup of tea...it just bored me to tears. my advice? go rent the original along with the Ring and Ring 2 Japanese versions and appreciate them, rather than watching the dire crap American attempts. poo poo poo.",The Grudge

This movie is almost driven entirely by the visual side, and as as such has received a lot of bad reviews by people who does not find those sort of movies scary/good.For my part, I think visual horrors are by FAR the most scary. Intelligent dialogue and an interesting plot, I admit, would make a technically better movie. However, for pure ""scare-effect"" this movie is superior to anything I have ever seen before.Describing the visual details will not rightfully describe the horror which they can produce, only a viewing can accomplish that. I only want to stress that this is, in my opinion, the most haunting visual horror ever made.9 of 10 - For being perfect in its particular genre",The Grudge

Know, why am i so harsh? because every minute i watched ""The grudge"" i thought about ""The Ring"". The two seem to be alike, but ""the Ring "" is pretty OK. Maybe not everybody saw the similitude between the two but i think it is obviously. The symbol of the child who had a not-very-nice childhood, the child that walks on the hall of the building, chasing the woman, seems to be the twin sister of Samara, the fact that people die one by one, and they are attracted to the house, etc etc. Now speaking only about ""the Grudge"", not about ""the Ring""...there are fun things like : boo-hoo, the bad spirit lives - of course - in the attic, and innocent-looking persons die first...if you want a really good, equilibrated, thrilling movie of the genre, watch ""The Exorcist"" (the old one) ;)",The Grudge

There were a few moments (read 2) that were moderately amusing but the rest was a dull slow burn lasting 2 hours but seeming to last 10. On a technical level I found nothing redeeming in the direction or score, and the editing was really really poor and detracted from any moment that could be considered scary.A side note. I have heard that the original originally went for 4 hours and was produced as a mini series. It was cut to fit an hour and a half which may go along way to explaining the plot holes and pointlessness of this film.I award this film 1 out of 10 (the second I have ever given that mark) and condemn it to the dustbin.",The Grudge

As the movie progressed I wasn't too enthusiastic about the movie. The acting, was phenomenal!! I mean Sarah Michelle Gellar did a great job in this movie, and considering, I thought she was amazing in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" I knew she was going to do the same in this movie. Well the plot itself was mediocre. Of course I jumped a few times, considering the way ""The Grudge"" looked, but for some reason, the way she looked reminded me a little too much of, Samara, from ""The Ring"".

I think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didn't like this film.

Although the reviews on this one are all over the map the fact that so many comments are registered is a testament to the impact this film has had. Not recommended for children. The creative innovation of not giving the characters or the audience any breathing room or break was highly effective. If you watch this one alone you will be looking over your shoulder for awhile. Although I don't gravitate toward horror films I wonder if the fast paced style employed (like a Indiana Jones paced horror film) has ever been attempted previously. It was unrelenting and offered no hope for the victims. I recommend this film and marvel at its impressionistic flavor and ability to tap into basic childhood type fear scenarios.

This, as it turned out, was a mistake.The Grudge takes everything unique, creepy and scary from the Japanese original and manages to make it mediocre. If you think I'm one of the naysayers who frequently trashes Hollywood films just for the fun of it, guess again. Sam Raimi makes an all-too conspicuous cameo in the remake, miscasting himself and lowering what little tension exists by appearing goofy and out of place, not to mention that the guy is NOT an actor. Is ego why he casts himself? It can't be because he's the best candidate, can it?The absolute scariest moment for me in the original (a character's encounter with the black-haired woman in the washroom) is a wasted, barely noticeable moment in this version and I'm not even getting to the horrible cgi... Hollywood thinks that by employing computer geeks to make something vaguely mysterious (the black form overwhelming the elderly woman in the original) all high tech actually makes it better?

I admit a possible jump scene is when the ""dead chick"" flies into the scenes at times, but overall the plot was a total disaster I mean what is it that kills them exactly? Being scared to death by seeing the dead kid and his mom. I have to admit this is a lame excuse for a film. I think Sarah made the mistake of making this film thinking it was a good opportunity to come back into the picture after her exit from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" The movie is short and the cutting away so frequently to the past events it makes my head hurt..I realize its necessary though, for such a poorly crafted film.

I think Gellar did a pretty good job in the lead, perhaps her Buffy experience made it easier for her. The plot needs some more explanations I think to be believable, but it works OK.Small spoiler.... that little boy that starts appearing on the house when Gellar gets there is a scary little bugger :-)Overall, pretty straight-forward scary-movie stuff, but effective and different enough to scare you, so it's worth a look.",The Grudge

I also liked how they did the one ghosts hair, but yet again, it's just good visuals. I like a movie that can give you a reason to be scared after it's over (i.e. The Exorcist) The Grudge was totally dependent on cheap shock horror, and left you with nothing after the credits started.

In fact, I rate this movie an 8 on a scale of 10. Personally, I found THE RING somewhat hokie. But, as someone who considers THE FOG a horror classic (guess I am dating myself); I thoroughly enjoyed this film.Since Hollywood considers films such as the Friday THE 13TH series & FREDDY KRUGER series the best in modern day horror genre; I found this film quite refreshing. It lacked the usual ""slasher for the sake of gore"" mentality. Though you were often thinking to yourself, ""No don't go in there""; as another viewer pointed out characters are not supposed to know that they are in a horror movie. So, even though you are thinking those thoughts it doesn't minimize the rationality of the characters actions or thought processes.I feel that the flash back sequences helped to establish the ""history"" of the curse & though somewhat disjointed, this worked for me. While my partner criticized that many of the ""jump"" scenes frequently faded to black; as another friend pointed out that this effect helped you to re-establish reality/calm down before the next scene.Again, if you are looking for a scary movie that is not cast from the general slasher mold; then I feel that you will enjoy THE GRUDGE.",The Grudge

You don't really know why she does anything, it seems...The ""jump"" moments are okay, which is why I gave it two stars, but the end was so not-scary I just laughed, the entire time.

The scary noises that the boy ghost makes are about as frightening to me as the same sounds my niece produces to annoy people at dinner time (little more that breathing slowly while holding your throat closed to produce a croaking/popping sound).The film reminded me mostly, of The Ring meets 21 grams, with its jumpy cutting between past and present.The only way this film will frighten you, is if the audience riots demanding its money back.Any suggestion of this film containing anything of the ""strange horror"" that is found in some of the newer Techno-age Horrors coming out of Japan and many other parts of Asia is a blatant lie. This film was filmed in Japan, and yet aside from some subtitled conversations, and the sceenery, it comes across as almost completely American.If you payed to see this film, you should feel cheated. If you had the opportunity of receiving a free ticket to it like me, you'll want to ask for a refund of your wasted time.To those of you who liked this film and actually got scared by it, i would like to suggest some much better horror films. Such as Sweating to the Oldies 1-4 because Richard Simmons is vastly more frightening, and the scariest part, he's real!

You've got to allow yourself to be scared, and be drawn into the Japanese city and the small, cursed house. This movie is actually quite scary while you're watching it, though the problem is that it doesn't have enough substance to leave a strong after-effect, like the kind that makes you keep your lights on at night. The acting isn't superb, and the characters are rather stereotypical, but that is all suitable for this kind of film. On the other hand the directing and cinematography are both very good. The suspense never lets up, though the movie's main flaw is that it reveals the ghost too soon and too often, and the ghost actually looks pretty comical. We fear what is unknown, and as long as the ghost is hidden from the screen we fear it.Overall an enjoyable and frightening movie, though there is nothing in it to ingrain itself in your memory and haunt your dreams (and maybe sometimes that's a good thing).",The Grudge

A bold move for a Hollywood movie, but it really didn't help much. Apart from an insight into what it might be like for a westerner to live in Japan, I found the whole experience unengaging, incongruous and mystifying. What was mean't to be scary was actually quite laughable, and when I went for a meal afterwards I found myself mimicking that strange rattling sound every time I saw a Japanese girl with heavy make-up. The Box Office results for this film are the result of three key ingredients; the producers reputation, the actress from Buffy, an excellent poster and the financial P&A might of the studio.

But hey, its a horror film, and as so many people would say, 'fuck plot.' fine, i'll do that. forget about the plot. the entire basis for scaring people in this film is ""shock."" and apparently, swift moving objects and sudden loud bursts of noise are the most horrifying things on earth. There was maybe one scene of extended suspense, but even then my heart wasn't racing even close to the speed that it beats after a big cup of coffee. I got really annoyed with the 'creapy' spirits too. I'm sorry, but a naked little Japanese boy with a habit of screaming does not make me jump out of my seat.

Then, here comes The Grudge, the remake of one of the scariest Japanese film. My mind was always saying ""Crap! Not another The Ring"".. But then, after seeing the well-displayed poster on my neighbourhood theater, it looks convincing for me to watch.. And so did I watched it. The opening sequence is a Classic Moment. Scared the HELL out of me. As for the storyline, it did lack of a certain things which was left out from the original. The scripts is in a way SIMPLE but the casts made the SIMPLE script into something WIDE just by their acting. Sarah Michelle Gellar (known for her role in Buffy and 2 Box Office Horror Movies for Scream 2 and I Know) brings out the character really well. I personally think she should just stick to acting in horror movies because that's her specialty. She maybe Hollywood's well known horror queen if the right movie comes. Jason Behr, Clea Duvall, Bill Pullman and KaDee Strickland also gave their fair best work in the movie. But credits for scaring will have to go to the ""MOTHER AND SON DUO"" because after i left the theater, i felt like they are just behind me.. Scary! And the Spooky House as well..

Just accept that the supernaturals do have powers in this film, and you will find this a truly fun roller-coaster ride!!It keeps you wanna scream and laugh and engaged at the same time. It is funny cos you know that the ghosts are just so fake and unrealistic, but then the music and the way it was shot keeps you engaged, makes you wanna hold your breath at lots of points.Watch this in the theatre or a place with big screen and good sound system. Try not to watch this if you have jobs that does door-to-door surveys or in-house visits, or if you are prone to heart attacks, otherwise, this won't haunt you like when you stand in front of the TV at night after you watch <The Ring>, but it gives you a good heart/lung muscles exercise, and you will find yourself having lots of fun in the theatre!",The Grudge
494,ricardo_urroz,WOW It's worth seeing.,9,5 November 2004,"Now at they, it's hard to watch a good horror movie. This production of THE GRUDGE, it is very good. I usually don't like horror or scary movies, because they seem more of a comedy than horror. But this movie have a very good plot, a very good punch scenes and fairly good performances. I am invited to watch it again, and I sugestt you go and watch it too, it will be better if you go with someone if you get afraid with ease. The very first minutes are just amazing as well as the last once, however, like I said before, it is very worth watching. Believe me.Ricardo Urroz, Flmmaker Student",The Grudge
495,og_ymra,Good Flick!,7,22 October 2004,"Excellent performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Story line was not void of interesting plot and the movie moved at a very good pace. Only beef is that the ending leaves you feeling a bit like you've just seen the ending to Blair Witch Project.There was also a good mix of frightening scenes that didn't need to be embellished with gore. I was surprised to learn that Sam Raimi had produced the movie, but, I know he has a life outside of Spiderman. Good return to the days when he was with Bruce Campbell.Overall, a great movie to take a date to and good for a scare.",The Grudge
496,graemefrears,The Ring it isn't!!!!!,7,13 November 2004,"Another Japanese film made remade for the world market that hits the spot for shocks but fails due to a poor story which isn't explained fully and has a predictable ending.Karen Davis (Gellar) is working in Tokyo as a home help nurse.When an employee fails to show for work Karen gets the job to care for an elderly lady at her house.All is well until strange noises take her to one of the bedrooms where she finds a small boy in a wardrobe,from then a series of events make Karen realize that all is not as it seems and that the house has a terrifying history that takes all who enter.The films scary moments have the desired effect (my wife missed most of the film as she was too busy hiding behind her hands)but the film lacks the flowing story of The Ring and fails to tie up the loose ends and a predictable ending leaves one feeling underwhelmed and cheated with the inevitable sequel to come in the future",The Grudge
497,harrymasonlives,Not so bad.,5,8 February 2005,"I didn't have a chance to see it in theaters so I had to wait for the DVD. I thought that it was a decent horror movie. There were some truly terrifying scenes that had me cringing. As a rule, I do not take Sarah Michelle Gellar seriously as an actress, though I thought she did a passable job. Bill Pullman did not have much of a role. I thought he should have had more screen time considering he is a rather good actor. The one thing that brings this movie down is the weak plot. Good Lord. I can understand when people say that this is SCARIER than the Ring, but no way can it even touch the Ring's story. Don't expect a mind bending plot filled with great twists and turns. Expect a rather basic story with a bunch of scary scenes. Some aspects of the film were either not explained or simply left open to interpretation. The ending was sorely lacking. It ended on a cliffhanger. Overall I would not recommend spending too much on it. Borrow it from a friend if you can. Renting is up to you. Five bucks seems about right if you want to see it just once. Sequel coming in 06. Maybe it will be better.",The Grudge

500,fire_sprite_pain,I'm still shaking...out of confusion?,6,22 October 2004,"Yeah, it's scary. One jump after the next with some great scare tactics to make you wet your pants. I have to hand it to the lack of gore horror, it's great. The movie was...however...not. A scattered plot, a sea of death...it was basically a slasher with no sex or blood. (spoilers ahead)...Now, there are some definitely haunting images. The girl, of course, has that look of panic, and you're never quite sure what it is she's after, but the whole stair scene is just creepy, she makes it work. The desperation that she has to kill is something that isn't seen in many monster films anymore, and I do note this is a monster movie. Yoko missing a jaw...that one is going to give me nightmares. It was a short scene, albeit a haunting one, but not completely unpredictable. That was most definitely the problem, the movie was FAR too predictable. If you've ever scene a jumpy movie, then you'll know far in advance when something is going to jump out at you. The creaking sound is creepy, but never given reason, which makes it less scary. A great sound effect, but the editing team and writer could have taken lessons from the team that did the remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", or the various Friday the 13th movies. If you have a scary sound, use it wisely. Basically, this will appeal to any idiot who wants to scream their heads off and have steamy sex afterwards, but for anyone who is looking for a well-plotted intelligent film, I'll be waiting for ""The Ring 2"" with you.",The Grudge

We loved ""The Ring"", but we have to put ""The Grudge"" ahead of it..this movie created fear, jumps, anxiety and rates high on the ""freak-out"" meter. As far as being a movie that people were laughing at, as some reviews have stated, in our ""Grudge"" experience the laughter was NERVOUS laughter covering up for the fact that people were getting scared and freaked-out...MANY said exactly that after the movie was over. virtually everybody in the theatre that night LOVED this movie and I, for one, cannot wait to get it on DVD.

503,HelmetsRhawt,Frightening...if you have ANY intelligence,10,28 October 2004,"*sigh* the only part of this movie that was laughable was all the awful comments from people trying to prove their intelligence by ripping the movie apart with big words they must have just learned. This movie was GOOD. I'm sorry that because the scenes jumped around many of you were confused, but it wasn't THAT hard to follow. There WAS a plot, and I think people misunderstood many parts. It is when someone dies in a fit of great rage or EXTREME SORROW (just like the officer said to SMG) that it leaves a stain on the place of the event. It curses the place where it happened. I loved the way the movie jumped around, because it leaves you wanting to know more, but also learning what has happened before. It is a technique that Stephan King uses in many of his books. It drives me nuts, but I love it at the same time.Now maybe I'm a wuss, but i was squeezing my boyfriends arm the whole time. I don't like long drawn out gore sessions, but I do enjoy all the waiting for them to happen. The sound the girl made was CREEPY because its a sound that isn't manufactured like that of the video in ""The Ring"". This movie dealt with average people, and people that died simply because they entered the wrong house. That's what made it so scary. They didn't go looking for the curse, and they weren't bad people. It was innocents dying for no reason.The ending was fitting for this movie. Everybody who has pointed out that they left it open for a sequel.....DUH. You think? This movie is a remake of a movie that ALREADY HAS A SEQUEL. Oi, people...come on.In closing.....this movie was good if you have the intelligence to follow it. It's good if you're going to sit back and enjoy it. It will haunt you afterwards if you have ANY type of imagination. This movie's plot isn't just handed to you, but if you think about it, it will come. It's a great movie for guys to take their girlfriends to ;)!",The Grudge
504,DiscoBiscuits,This movie sucks,1,8 November 2004,"This is one of the most un-scary movies ever. It was a ridiculously stupid ending. I can't even delve into how bad it was because it is pissing me off, but umm I will.... It was just bad. The direction was at least decent, but it was way too much like the Ring, it seems like they used the same type of cinematography. They sure used the same type of scares..... the really stupid kind. Why did they have that stupid old ladies' hand hit the ground, and then add a really loud bang which in no way could have been caused by her hand hitting the floor? Thats plain stupid. Its those kind of cheap scare tactics(sorry I know there is a retarded show of that name)that make horror movies bad and not scary, thus not really horror movies.

505,writelasse,Another one bites the grudge,3,2 June 2005,"I saw this movie yesterday and actually was a bit bored with it. Sure, i got scared by the countless scenes of another scary looking pale boy/woman popping up in an unexpected place (properly triggered by a typical gloomy low pitched sound), but that can't quite cover up for the lack of tension and consistency and the one dimensional characters.Maybe it's the American version that does it. I saw the original Japanese versions of ""The Ring"" and ""Dark Water"" and they scared the living daylights out of me. ""The Ring"" is a movie that still scares med today, several years after watching it.Back to ""The Grudge"": The cast, in my opinion, feels way to big for a minimalistic thriller like this. What are all these people doing there? Bill Pullman is absolutely wasted in that little part that he plays. It feels like the director tried to squeeze the cast of three movies into one.The ending: It seems that they are all going to die anyways, so what's the point in getting emotionally involved? And of course the body of Karens boyfriend has to suddenly move under the sheet. How surprising. Spend your money on a more original thriller/horror movie than this.",The Grudge

I now live with the knowledge that somewhere out there my two dollars are in the sweaty pocket of some dick-weed theater worker... Alas I will never know what happened to those dollars... If you saw the Japanese version of the movie (also not that good) just avoid this one. If you missed out on ""Ju-On"" do yourself a favor and miss out on this as well.

This movie was horrible though, it provided neither. About the creepiest visual was the girl with her jaw ripped off, but even that was presented in such a poor way, that it ended up just being cheesy. Everyone I heard leaving the theaters were complaining about the film and wanting their money back(which was only $2.00 because it was at the discount theaters). The only exception was two very young girls who said it was ""The scariest movie they'd ever seen"", but I don't even know how they got in the film as they only appeared to be ten years old or so.

509,waheed,The grudge review,8,15 January 2005,"Hi everyone this is my first time using on IMDb.I have just seen the Grudge i would like to say it is much better and a lot scarier than i thought it would be. The film stars Buffy star Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is an American carer in Japan. When she goes on her first job she goes an American house to look after an American elderly. As soon as she enters the house the tone of the film becomes a lot darker and finds there are other people in the house that shouldn't be there. I don't wanna give anymore away- you'll have to see it! I have to say i did enjoy the film and would recommend it to others, it's diffidently the scariest horror i've see ages. There have been a lot of people saying it is a rip off version of the ring, but they are completely different stories.But the Ring overall i would have to say is better because as the director of the grudge did say his inspiration for this film was the ring. So i have to say ring is better because of it's originality and because the story is more complete than the grudge. If you've seen the ending to the grudge you'll know what i mean!. I've heard there is supposed to be 2 jap version of grudge with the same ending- this is why i was slightly disappointed with the ending it seemed as though the director didn't know how to end the story so he went for an easy you cant do anything about ( like in jeepers creepers- you can't kill the monster)the curse ending. But i've heard there is gonna be a third part to jap version which i'm hoping will give fans a satisfying ending than the he's been using for the first two films. This is why i've said the ring is only slightly better because they didn't just say you can't do anything about the curse of the ring but they give a excellent ending unlike the grudge. But i still recoommend you watch the grudge- it will stay in your head for days!",The Grudge
510,rcarl,The Grudge is an unapologetic ghost story that delivers A+ shocks and thrills and a truly eerie sense of foreboding.,8,2 February 2005,"As a lifelong disappointed horror film fan, I was finally sated with the Grudge! I must say that to all those people out there like myself; a long suffering fan of the horror film genre, this is our movie! A true horror film achieves what the Grudge does: scare the s*&$t out of you. How many times over countless decades have we been let down by one numbing slasher, ghost story, cheesy monster flick after another. Filmmakers in this genre seem to have low opinions of their target audience. Predictable plots, boring characters that you HOPE will die in some gory way, and black cats jumping through windows at just the precise moment while all along a soundtrack plays in the background giving away everything and telling you when to be scared and when to take a breather, seem to be the rule. Now we have The Grudge, which shoves its way past those pretenders, re-inventing the genre. I will admit, when I first noticed this film open last Fall and Sarah Michelle Gellar headline the poster, I was skeptical. Here we go again, another dumbed down Horror film targeted at the teenage Saturday night date audience. And it was rated PG-13! Wrong again I was. Think of Gellar as one of those quarterbacks on a great football team: not such a fine athlete or prolific Hall-of-Famer, but a team player who blends in with the others. She doesn't make mistakes that cost the team a victory, throws the ball away when there is no play, and realizes she is not above anyone else on the field. She is adequate and appropriate for the role. In fact, the entire cast in the film is of the same comparison. They are merely vessels that carry the narrative, chess pieces in an ultimate game of fear and dread. I won't say too much about the plot because most of the other reviews have done a fine job in describing its non-linear progression, even though it was a good deal less episodic than the original; a positive in my opinion. It is also a film that will stay with you for a long while afterwords. I just saw it and it is all I can think about, and I have a feeling it will be with me for a few days to come. Perhaps our young American ""Horror"" filmmakers should travel to Japan and get schooled by this fresh crop of Asian newbies to the genre. We will all be the better for it! I want more!",The Grudge

A suggestive movie that had the touch to really creep you out with the occasional scares.When a friend of mine asked me if I would like to join him for a movie night out for The Grudge, a new horror movie with Buffy, my expectations were low. I don't like too much blood, gore and all that other stuff that's actually more hilarious than frightening. And when he said the word ""horror"", that was the first thing that popped into my mind.But from the first scene of The Grudge, I immediately had the feeling that this could be another kind of terror. And, my oh my, during the entire movie, I held my hand in front of my face, scared of what was coming next! I never thought a movie could be so extremely psychological terrifying. A good horror movie is a movie that scares the h*ll out of me, and The Grudge did more than that. Perfect camera angles, creepy music or just nothing but silence. Excellent.My friends and I still talk about it and we all agree that this is the best horrorfilm we've seen until now. Props to Takashi Shimizu for making this film as it is now!

518,crossfire_3001,Japanese Ghosts carry a Grudge,6,4 May 2005,"Japan has a long, ghostly tradition with beings from beyond the grave. Nemerous stories and legends in Japan of these otherworldly visitors abound. Ghosts often play key roles in Kabuki theater and were a favorite though perhaps somewhat overly-used character by Kabuki playwrights. Many of the ghosts that appear in plays and stories are females seeking revenge for wrongs done to them during their lifetime typically by cruel, heartless husbands.In the old ghost stories, vengeful Japanese ghosts would continue haunt their victims until they went insane, died, or at least made some form of restitution to appease the angry spirits. Some Japanese ghosts were born out of tragedy or sorrow and would haunt any person who came near. These spirits were particularly feared because they represented a danger to all unless they were somehow put to rest.Although I knew about the horrific nature of old Japanese ghosts, I had thought modern Japanese ghosts would be more polite and demur. I had imagined a modern Japanese ghost timidly coming up to someone and saying ""Suimasen - Excuse me! BOO! Gomen naisai -I'm sorry!"" before whisking away. ""The Grudge"" showed me how wrong I was about modern Japanese phantoms.""The Grudge,"" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame, depicts a haunting by very impolite spirits. Gellar plays an American student nurse in Tokyo who accidentally gets involved with a haunted house that has the nasty habit of killing visitors. The ghosts of the house were victims of a tragedy and now they rudely kill anyone who comes in contact with them.The spirits' motivation for killing is explained at the beginning of the film in a brief written prologue which states: ""when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind."" For Western audiences it may seem unusual that the two main ghostly antagonists who having been innocent victims of a violent death themselves would seek to cause the death of another innocent person. This flies in the face of a Western audience's sense of justice and fairness.In many Western ghost stories, ghosts despite their spookiness are often motivated by the same things as living people namely the pursuit of justice for wrongdoings. The ghost of a murdered person will seek vengeance on the person or persons responsible for their death.If a ghost is malevolent, it often turns out they were a bad person in life - as in the back-story to the main ghost character in the ""Poltergeist"" movies.To understand the nature of the supernatural entity of ""The Grudge,"" one has to understand Japanese belief in spirits and the supernatural.In the book ""Ghosts and the Japanese: Cultural Experience in Japanese Death Legends"" by Michiko Iwasaka, there is a passage which is a direct echo of the opening lines of the movie: ""Anyone who dies under great emotional stress creates an energy which is not easily dissipated; these yurei - ghosts, thus, have an impact on the local environment..."" This type of spirit is called a ""goryo"" - vengeful ghost. A goryo, however, is less like a consciously aware ghost that plots revenge like those featured in Kabuki plays and which would be more familiar to Western audiences. A goryo is more like the energy of the emotion created at the time of death. And to some degree it represents the unconscious mind free of the limitations and morals of the conscious analytic side.Formal belief of goryo can be traced to the Heien Period (794-1185) when goryo were believed to be the angry spirits of political enemies that had died in exile or had been executed. The noted scholar Sugawara-no-Michizane became one such goryo. Through guileful manipulations, his enemies at the Imperial Court engineered his banishment from Kyoto. Sugawara died in extreme sorrow while in exile. Shortly after his death, a number of natural disasters occurred from droughts and epidemics to lightening strikes. It was believed to be caused by the angry spirit of Sugawara. To appease his goryo, Sugawara was given ceremonial promotion at the Imperial Court and eventually he was made into a god-spirit whom modern-day students pray to for success on their exams.Director Takashi Shimizu has built on this old concept to create a deadly goryo of a very frightening ghostly Mother and Son duo. ""The Grudge"" is an American remake of the original Japanese thriller ""Ju-on"" (2003). ""Ju-on"" is Shimizu's horror franchise. ""Ju-on"" grew out of a short TV story to become a successful and scary theater-release movie which was followed by a sequel. Famed Spiderman director, Sam Ramie, who helped produce the American remake thought ""Ju-on"" to be one of the scariest movies he had ever seen.""The Grudge"" opened in America during the Halloween season last fall but it has only recently opened in Japan. One notable difference is the inclusion of a few extra violent moments that were left out in the American version in order for the movie to keep a PG-13 rating in the States.Overall there's not much of story. Some people die, then some other people die. Most of the film is just one scare after another with little character development or plot. ""The Grudge"" is more like a series of creepy vignettes strung together to make a film. However, these vignettes are quite scary. Its the cultural nuance of the goryo-type spirit that ""The Grudge"" represents and the genuinely frightening moments that makes the film an interesting experience for Japan-o-philes and horror fans alike.On the Scare-O-Meter, ""The Grudge"" rates about 4 out 5 Screams.On Plot, it rates about 2 stars out of 5; however the concept behind the movie rates about a 4.",The Grudge
519,LimeyDave,The Ring for those with a brain,8,10 September 2005,"Having started with the inevitable comparison in the title, I'll side-step the whole ""Ring vs Grudge"" argument for later. The Grudge is actually a remake of a Japanese film Ju-on: the Grudge aka Ju-on 3, the third, (obviously), in a series of movies.It's impossible to tell you the storyline, without giving away some of the ""surprises"" in the plot, so go ahead and skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to spoil those surprises. The basic story, set in Japan, is that of an American family taking up residence in a house whose previous occupants had been involved in domestic murder/suicide. Enter Sarah Michelle Geller as the new American care worker for the disabled mother, (the first care worker having been dispatched in one of the opening scenes) and all manner of spooky goings on ensue. It seems that anyone entering the house, is subject to ""The Grudge"" or curse that now haunts the house, and after a short period of time is visited by an apparition which.... well you don't actually see what it does, but you know its just not pleasant.To judge The Grudge is not that easy, it's rather non-liner style does mean that the viewer has to carefully pay attention to the movie as the story unfolds. Unlike The Ring, (which I thought was pretty excellent), which washed over and enveloped you into the storyline, The Grudge is far more subtle in it's scares. For example, when one of the characters is in an elevator, going to the top of her building, if you don't pay attention to what's going on in the background, the scene just looks like a woman in an elevator. Nothing scary there, right? But by paying attention, the viewer is left with an impending sense of dread, as the character alights the elevator, and enters her apartment, oblivious to her fate. It is subtlety such as this, that will escape anyone who thought Friday the 13th was a demanding experience, and leave them a bit cold. This is NOT an in your face movie.It's ironic that perhaps The Grudge's biggest strengths, could also be regarded as some of its biggest weakness'. The film is shot in such a way as to make the viewer is a rather dispassionate voyeur on the unfolding events. This approach is good, in that we get to see all parts of the story, and are able to piece things together in a way the characters cannot. However, it can leave the viewer feeling a little uninvolved also. Too, as mentioned in the storyline paragraph, all the actual killings occur off camera. Wonderful for those of us with an imagination, not so good for the ""if it don't splatter, it don't matter"" brigade.The Japanese certainly have their own style of movie making, and Takashi Shimizu who directs, (I believe this is his first film for western audiences), thankfully does not compromise that style too much. The time line jumps, are used to explain events after we have seen them, and rather than the usual ""creepy"" music, a soul chilling sound is used to build tension, and let us the viewer know of an imminent attack by the apparition. This certainly will not to be everyone's taste, but then I like my movies to confuse me, then give me a chance to work things out, rather than spell them out to me one syllable at a time.I started this off side-stepping the whole ""Ring vs Grudge"" debate, and will address that now. Let's start this off by looking at what they have in common. Both were based on Japanese films, (Ringu for The Ring and Ju-on: The Grudge aka Ju-on 3 for The Grudge). Both have apparitions with lots of hair. Both have creepy kids in them, and and both are ghost stories. Its there that the direct comparisons really end. To have seen one is definitely not to have seen the other. Was one ""inspired"" (read ripped off), by the other, quite possibly, but who cares? Tarantino has been making movies ""inspired"" by other movies for years, and we love him for it.The performances by the actors are adequate, nothing Oscar winning, but certainly good enough to keep things believable.To summarize. The Grudge is a good little movie, to be watched when one can give it ones full attention, and at night with the lights low and someone special to cling to for the scary bits. Watching it with distractions, (kids going to bed, won't go to bed, friends visiting and insisting on talking all the way through the movie, etc.), is NOT going to work.Overall, a good ghost story, and well worth the watch.",The Grudge
520,OrangeCalifornia,The scene about the innocent girl at the beginning of the movie...,5,20 October 2005,"I have to admit that, even though I am a 20 year old man, the scene where the tongue slipped out from a certain part of the young Japanese girl's face (I have no idea how to describe it; however if you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about) scared the sh*t out of me! I gave this movie 5 out 10 mainly because there were a lot of scenes that were simply lame and did not help develop the story at all!!!!!!!!Also, the last scene of the movie was a little weird. Was there a nurse standing right next to Karen (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar.)NOTE: The original Japanese version was not as bloody but definitely much scarier!!!!",The Grudge
521,tictactoe93,"Scare after scare, it never forgives",7,18 February 2006,"The Grudge, a remake of a Japanese film (Ju-on), is pretty well-made. The music adds suspense to the scenes and moments that make you jump and spill your popcorn are thrown in everywhere.The story is set in Tokyo when Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is assigned to care for Emma, a woman who appears lost to the world, when her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears and doesn't return for work. After first meeting Emma, Karen goes to explore the house and then the scares begin soon after she finds a duct taped closet.This movie is not like any horror film I've ever seen. Some say it's too much like the Ring, but I think otherwise. The ghosts, spirits in this movie who are left because they died in powerful rage or sadness, don't just pop out, say ""Boo!"" or ""Seven days."", Kayoko is welcomed into the scene by the noise she makes through her throat since her throat was crushed by her jealous husband and Toshio is recognized by his cat or his hisses and meows. It's not just a haunted house, either. The house isn't really haunted, it's the people who spend time in the house. Kayoko is found haunting many other places elsewhere.I hope this comment helps and gives you a new view of the movie. I rate it 9/10 because it scared the crap out of me.",The Grudge

The girl that plays the actual 'grudge ghost' is brilliant. She looks amazing and does the whole thing really well. From what I can gather, the director is a brilliant director. It's not really gory and I suppose some people might find it quite scary but I didn't. I'm completely stunned by the film and I've become obsessed with learning Japanese language and doing other Japanese stuff. I think maybe Sarah Michelle Geller kind of spoils it a bit but only slightly. I guess its because every time you see Sarah Michelle Geller you stereotype her as Buffy and therefore cant imagine seeing her in anything else. All in all its a great movie. No hang ups about it.

I was expecting an entertaining horror movie with some bad lines and a few jumps to keep me entertained. What i got was an insufferable bore. The characters are all without development or personality, the plot is virtually non-existent and the film is full to the brim with long, slow paced scenes which leave your mind to wander off on unrelated tangents for five minutes or so (""what shall i eat for dinner tonight?"") when suddenly you realise that you're supposed to be feeling tense! The only good thing i can think of to say about this film is that in parts, it's so bad that it's funny.

It was pretty creepy and had just the kind of stuff I'm looking for in a scary movie. Also, I'm not at all a Sarch Michelle Gellar fan but she was good in this, I have to say.

527,harajuku_irrashaimase,Holy....fuji (no pun intended). Advice: don't leave creaky doors in the house untreated after this one!,8,8 December 2005,"""Oh...my...effing....god...."" That was all I could say after the movie began and the first little chills started the goosebumps going. I've seen this movie four times, and to tell you the truth, it just gets better and better. I'm still paranoid. I am waiting for one of the ghosts to pop up in a really stupid, random place (shower, wardrobe, behind door, in locker, etc.). Paranoia factor: 10. --WARNING!!: Following contains plot spoilers--The film opens with a quickly-quick-quick explanation of the term 'Grudge' (in the movie's sense). What would have made it creepier is it as a dictionary entry. Strike half a point. Next, we see Yoko, a caretaker for Emma, an elderly American woman who appears to be catatonic (did I spell that right?). Well, lah de dah. The house is trashed. By 'trashed' I mean 'rubbish everywhere, newspaper up the stairs' you get the idea. It looks like a bomb hit it. Well, Yoko, being a caretaker, understandably starts the cleanup, whilst chatting away in Japanese to a friend on the phone. Whilst diligently picking up paper, she hears a sort of walking noise above her. What's the room above her? The attic of course! (cliche #1) Well, her being a girl, she heads off to investigate. Finds a room, with a crawlspace all boarded up. Here's the stupidity factor: She climbs up the crawlspace, lights a cigarette lighter and promptly begins exploring. Who does she run into? None other than Kayako, the Grudge-girl (as I have happily dubbed her)!Well, I'll be very sketchy now, I felt like describing the opening scenes well. Now, there were many jumps in here, and many points where I yelled out ""YOU IDIOT!"" at the television screen. For example, when one character gets into bed and pulls the covers up, it's pretty obvious that it'll attack her in bed (hence the term, 'mattress monster'). Although, the security camera scenes were especially scary, owing to the fact that we now know how Kayako moves around and appears (see Ju-On: The Grudge 2 for a clever example). At another point, where Karen jumps in an elevator, you think 'Now you watch, it'll get her in the elevator coz she's a stupid blonde and didn't think!' WRONG!! Karen actually manages to survive through the movie...presumably past the end. Well, to cut it shorter, there were some scenes which were apparently cut from the American release, particularly a scene that was later reused in Ju-On 2, the scene involving the (presumed) husband of the late Kayako, hanging from Kayako's hair being swung by little Toshio (who you will creepily notice seems to pop up before each Kayako appearance). Also, the scene of Toshio being drowned in the bathtub was meant to be cut, but never was. The creepiest scenes of all would have to be the diary scene and the scene unenthusiastically titled 'Kayako Crawls Down The Stairs', which I would have called 'Goodbye Karen'. But that's me. That scene was especially creepy in the way that Kayako moved. Reminiscent of Samara climbing the well in The Ring (or so people tell me), her movements are jerky and insect-like. Rigor mortis, perhaps?The only major error was in the 'Jawless Kayako' scene. Didn't the director ever do Biology in year 8? Or look at the bottom of his tongue in a mirror? If he had, he would know that the tongue is attached to the jaw. I rest my case.All I will say to cut this review a little shorter, is this: Never watch without lights and a teddy bear. --Aurabesh out--",The Grudge

Movies like House of Wax with Paris Hilton running around like mad trying to sound desperate or The Ring 2 which had become ""over-digitalised"" with water coming out of the sofa. I gave the 2004 horrors another chance by going to The Grudge and I must say I'm glad I've done that! It's the one of the scariest horror movies in the last 10 years. Even though the main plot is very simple, you don't care much and you simply let yourself flow into the story full of scary scenes and frightening characters.

I think so many American film makers feel if they can put in gore, it makes a good horror flick. To me, the scare factor is what makes a movie downright frightening and I think the Grudge does that.I was stuck with images and sounds from the film for days afterwards - I couldn't get some of the sounds out of my head. Even after the source of the images and sounds were explained in the film, it was still very disturbing.I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I do not frighten easily and this scared the living s---- out of me.

Is subtitling really that scary?Is this movie only worth a 1 as compared to the 8 I gave the original then? Well, in all fairness perhaps not. After all it's the same director who's done them both and he's still - despite the bigger budget - been very careful with adding special effects (which usually are the dearth of all American original horror stories).

If you liked ""The Ring"" you will probably like this movie, too -- the feel is similar. While I am not a huge fan of Sarah M. Gellar she did a credible job.

So, thinking that it was probably stupid. (like most of the movies he loves) I settle down on the couch, and what do I get? Just what I thought.My boyfriend loves this movie, ""one of my favourites"" as he said. Me? I would complain if I had to watch it again.The reason this movie was made was to scare you. It didn't do a good job of it though. Okay, it did make me jump at least twice. But I didn't find the movie scary. Most people who haven't watched the movie will say: Ooooooooooooooo, the cover of the box is scary looking! The movie must be sooo scary! Ha.The story itself is okay, except it's with another cliff ending. *sigh* Too many movies these days (in the horror genre) leave with cliffies just so they can make more money off of another one. If The Grudge 2 comes out, I'd actually go to see it. Only if I can rent it though. It's probably a rip-off to see it in the movies.The movie box (the Canadian one that I am talking about is different than the one shown above) makes the movie look terrifying when really it's absolutely not. It is a nice DVD/VHS cover, though.The music (as I can remember) is pretty good. It flows with what is happening and when there isn't music, something important (to the plot) is usually happening.(note the ""usualy"")And last, the graphics. Well, to put it simple, the computer graphics suck, and the make-up is superb.Did I like this movie?: No. I know the story is okay but I like horror films by there gore/scariness. This didn't show any of what I'm looking for.Pros: The music is pretty good and so is the storyline. Cons: It leaves people with a cliffhanger ending and claiming to be scary, but isn't.The Storyline: 7 The Presentation: 7 The Music: 9 The Graphics: 5Overall: A 7 average",The Grudge

The order in which the scenes are shown is random...first is Bill Pullman's character suicide, then 3 years later Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) comes to the house after a home nurse, Yoko, disappeared (killed by kayako) then it goes back to when the old lady and her kids (clea duvall;daughter in law, Kadee s.;daughter) move in then killed.The plot wasn't strong per say, but enough to lead you on through the whole movie, also the scare factor was high but very little gore or blood. Scary scenes pop up randomly and everyone's performance was great...even Ted Raimi (JOXER!) was good.Sarah was very good and played the victim part to the T, I was happy with it, excellent career move. Jason, Clea and the rest were also good and I agree that even though Sarah was the main attraction, it was an ensemble cast.This is my OWN Opinion but I guess a sequel might be done given Karen doesn't die, who knows.The scary scenes were a real thrill whether you scare easily or not.

I recently saw ""Hostel"" and quite honestly, the appeal was the gore, blood and guts. Nothing is to be feared from a dead body. But in The Grudge, it is understood that everything is to be feared from spirits, particularly if they are angry spirits. The movie was genius simply because of one thing: You can't beat something in 2 1/2 hours and have a nice happy ending. Everybody dies, but that's okay. It truly shows that in Japanese culture, it is known and understood that there are things in the world, and in life, that are much bigger than you, and stronger, and more powerful, and sometimes, you just can't beat them. That's just it. That's why the Scream movies s**cked, why the Ring movies really weren't so frightening when you think about it, and why the Saw movies made everybody cringe, no matter how tough you thought you might have been.

545,jakes_boss,the grudge,7,5 October 2006,"I actually liked the movie. It freaked me out. They took advantages of cliché's, but made them interesting and surprising. Scenes with bathtubs of water and and creepy stairways are used almost too often in movies, but I really think they made good use of them. Even though we know there is a scare coming, the movie never ceases to startle me. They also did a good job on creating faces and moments that are unforgettable. I was sucked into the movie and walked along side Karen as she desperately tried to understand what was happening and feared for her life. I can't wait to see The Grudge 2.

Definitely more creepy than scary, but anyway, I wanted to start a discussion to see what everyone thought about certain aspects of the story line that I am still pondering (**These questions will contain plot spoilers**) -Why did Toshio talk to Rachel? It was the only time in the whole movie he actually said something, so why did he decide to watch her from the stairs and answer her question about who he was? -Is Toshio protecting Rachel? For several characters, Toshio went right after them, but he didn't with Karen. Then at the end of the movie, Karen gets to see the whole flashback about what happened to the family, and I got the impression that Toshio was the one showing it to her, since he looks right at her during it. Then it's Toshio's mother that comes after Karen, not Toshio.",The Grudge

A lot of people have said to me that it was extremely difficult to understand. I found that out at first, but after watching it a few times, ( 5 or 6 times! ) I finally got the hang of it.

We were treated to a rehash of several horror movies, including the far superior Ringu. The biggest fault of this film is that it's only means of raising suspense is to build up the music to a crescendo, after which the audience is treated to a quick surprise, like so many weak slasher flicks of the late 90s. The characters lack any sort of depth, with no back stories or motivations what so ever, and the acting is weak at best, especially from leading lady Sarah Michelle Gellar, no surprise there.

I am so glad I have not seen the Grudge 2, I Reckon it will be worse than the first one. I would not classify this movie as 'horror' I'd classify it as ""Crap."" There should be more blood & guts for 'horror' movies. And more action that leaves you with a Cliff-hanger most of the time. Not just sitting there waiting for it to end. The best Horror Movie I saw, was ""Without Warning.""(in the 70's-80's) That alien's face still haunts me everyday.

When the movie first begins, tantalizing ""clues"" materialize to what might be behind the dark events of the house around which the story centers, only to be ultimately meaningless excuses for a cheap scare or utterly obvious. The Grudge is no more than a typical haunted house story and adds nothing whatsoever to the genre, in much the same manner as Stephen King's Rose Red miniseries did not live up to its full potential. Beware of comparisons to The Ring, a much more compelling and original thriller. Kudos to the production staff who give the movie a consistently dark and spooky tone even during broad daylight, however it's too bad there wasn't substance to back up the visuals. There is also the matter of Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance, which demonstrates the very small range she has as an actress and how short-lived her career will be when her beauty fades. ""Karen"" is virtually indistinguishable from ""Buffy"" (a show of which I happen to be a huge fan) except for Buffy would have kicked the ghost's ass.Ultimately, I am still waiting for someone to take the haunted house concept in a new direction.

Though the protagonists are now gaijin in Tokyo I believe the story is more or less faithful to the original. (It should be since the same director made it.) The movie wasn't as scary as it was suspenseful. They didn't use gratuitous violence and special effects which was nice. Just good old-fashioned horror craft, adeptly using the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. I liked it better than the American Ring but that could be partially because I liked the Japanese setting. Some of the illogical things I didn't care for (like if a curse exists in a place, how can it show up halfway across Tokyo?) but I feel that way about just about any movie.",The Grudge

That really helped to set the mood. Aside from the great and numerous jump out of your seat scares, the plot is actually somewhat thick. The bad news is that it is a challenge to keep track of what is happening now, and what happened in the past. The good news is that it is a challenge to keep track of what is happening now, and what happened in the past. This isn't your typical psycho-killer-chasing-the-girl type movie.

The house was extremely creepy, and the way the ghosts moved gave me the shivers. I must admit that often the story line was predictable, yet I still screamed because the ghosts were really scary/creepy.I still get creeped out when I'm alone in the dark and think about those ghosts, and the way they moved.

Not much else to say except do not watch unless you like horror. It was better than the ring because it even said so on the box. Every time I see an Asian person I think they are jaw less. too scary for me. Toshio is really scary to me and so is Kayako. Come on, pulling someone under the bedsheets?

American films have started to concentrate too much on gimmicks and gore, and not enough on using suspense to shock the audience. I know the entire theater was jumping during the Grudge and that's about as much as you can ask for from a horror movie. I thought using the original Japanese director and not Americanizing the film kept it true to its roots in Japanese culture. The special effects were believable and the sets were magnificent. I liked the use on non-linear time in the movie to help give background into what was happening without revealing too much of the story too early in the picture.",The Grudge
557,scottbowles,Twice as frightening as 'The Ring',8,14 October 2004,"While it may take some knocks for being derivative of that other Japanese remake, 'The Grudge' actually manages more chills thanks primarily to a much simpler plot. At its core, 'The Grudge' is a haunted house flick. The beauty of it, however, is that it avoids the typical haunted house plot lapse: If the house is haunted, why not leave it? 'The Grudge' posits that anyone who enters the doors becomes cursed by the fury that inhabits the home -- a curse happy to follow you back to your house, work, elevator, car. While there are a few campy conventions -- is anyone really going to venture into an attic oozing with the sounds of thuds and moans with only a lighter to illuminate the way? -- the film, for the most part, works like a charm. Quite a haunted charm at that.",The Grudge
558,virginia_greene,Given another hour it could have been better...,4,30 October 2004,"This film had potential. I did not expect it to live up to 'The Ring' but I did expect it to be scary. It started off strong but then died. The ending not only left room for a sequel which I hope would be a lot better (more elaborate) but it seemed too intentional as if it was only setting up for a sequel if you catch my drift. I think had another hour been given to the film to elaborate upon the story and the characters it would have been a lot scarier. The film also left a lot to be desired and too many questions left unanswered with those all too unfamiliar with the non-pop part of Japanese culture, such as the spiritual importance to the film, along with the concept of collectivism in the culture.I do plan on seeing Ju-on: The Grudge (the original Japanese version) and I hope it is better than this American version. As for the story behind it, it was wonderful.",The Grudge
559,movie-geek,"""The whole time I was in that house I felt something was wrong.""",10,22 February 2005,"Hi. I live in Tokyo, and I just went to see The Juon at a cinema in Ikebukuro.As a horror fan who is aware of and disappointed by the fact that 95% of horror films are pure and utter shite, I am constantly on the lookout for a decent, full-blooded, and - damn it - scary, horror flick. The Juon is it. At last, another gem to prove that horror is not dead and will continue to shamble on zombie-like producing the occasional spine-chilling shocker which makes the wait worth it.It may be true that there are some cultural factors involved (which might explain the negative reviews from some of our western friends in the discussion boards), and I will readily admit that perhaps it had such a big impact on me because I could relate to so much of it.I mean, the interior of the house looks exactly like my apartment; tatami floors, sliding doors and closets, and so on; the Tokyo scenes were all familiar; the freaky wild-cats-in-heat noises that sound like babies from hell all over the city during mating season; I know what it feels like to be a fish-out-of-water gaijin in Japan (I'm Irish) and like Bill Pulman's character I am an English teacher.Without wishing to create any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, I'm sure those who have will appreciate why I was suitably freaked out.There is often terror to be found in the familiar (just ask Stephen King), so perhaps it was a little too unfamiliar for western audiences.Also, people complain that they can't understand this or that, and demand explanations. In Japanese horror, it is the understated, the inexplicable, the unknown, that makes it scary. The same thing happened with The Ring. People wanted explanations for everything: who is Sadako? What motivates her? A lot of these questions were addressed in the American remake, with the result that the clarified story was too ridiculous and unbelievable. Basically, they tried to explain too much.On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that a lot of the negative reviews (saying it's not scary, etc.) are referring to the American version of the movie only. If you check out the ""trivia"" section in the menu on the left of this IMDb page, you'll find that the movie was released cut after American test screen audiences viewed it, presumably because it was too scary.Can't have that now, a scary horror movie. I know, I know. I'm scratching my head too.If you're a horror fan, do yourself a favour and try to get a hold of the uncut Japanese version (ie; the real movie). I'm not sure, but it might crop up on DVD. Now that is what scary is all about.Forget 'Freddy vs Jason', or 'Jason goes to Space' or whatever. I give The Juon 10 out of 10.",The Grudge

In the original movie, Jason's character wasn't added, so that was a plus in this movie. We are long time fans of Jason Behr (we watched everything he's in). We are also Buffy fans. This movie was very scary, but every time a Jason scene would come on we were relaxed (also the scene that were in the interviews & trailers). True that Jason (Doug) wasn't in many scenes, but the ones that he was in; he played a very strong character; who held his own ground. This was Jason's main starring male lead since Roswell ended. We are very very disappointed in the ending (For those Jason Behr Fans when you go see this movie you'll know why).We rate this movie as the following: R instead of PG-13 //// 10 Stars for Jason's wardrobe & character //// 4 1/2 Stars for Sarah (Buffy would have kicked that ghostly ass back to hell) //// A single star for rest of the cast (but Bill gets a half of star because of his short opening) //// and 2 thumbs up for the DirectorIn conclusion, we learned a lot of Japanese words.

563,ringfan,An enhancement of the original,9,29 December 2004,"I had seen the original (Ju-on) a year or so ago, and liked it, but I'd have to say that the remake was smoother than the original, and creepier. Keeping the story in in Japan was a nice touch, preserving some of the original feel. The plot was also tweaked in a few places to make it more accessible - for instance the time travel scene in the remake was better integrated into the plot.The movie begins with the unsettling and mysterious suicide of an American professor (Bill Pullman), setting the tone and providing some background for the unfolding story.Sarah Michelle Gellar, in Japan with her boyfriend (Jason Behr) who is studying at a Japnese school, is thrust into a bizarre supernatural world when she is assigned to substitute as a caretaker for an American family, in place of the regular caretaker, a local Japanese girl who has gone missing. Devoid of any Buffy-like powers, she nevertheless copes gamely through persistence and pluck.Ryo Ishibashi, who played the ill-fated suitor in the horror film ""Audition"", gives a workmanlike performance as the hard-boiled cop assigned to investigate the missing persons report. He soon discovers more than he ever bargained for.As the plot develops, these and other threads slowly come together and reveal a tale of unrequited love, jealousy and murderous rage, which transforms into a deadly and persistent spirit oppressing the house where it all took place.Some ghastly and gory surprises await the viewer, as the eerie, persistent sense of foreboding, of something just very wrong, pervades every scene and builds to the final conclusion.

564,ThomBjork,A handful of clichés sugar-coated in plot holes galore!,2,23 October 2004,"I must admit that I went into ""The Grudge"" having low expectations. However, after seeing the 6/10 critics average, I thought, maybe it might not be so bad after all. Boy, was I wrong. The movie lacked dialogue, that of which wasn't extremely horrid (but there wasn't much of), and the only highlights of the movie were the scenes with the wonderful Clea DuVall and the actress playing her husband's sister. The movie was too reminiscent of other ""Japanese"" movies/remakes--""Ringu/The Ring"" ""The Eye"" (all of which I actually liked) --but didn't hold as much originality as they did. It just basically pulled the same tricks out of the bag--black cats, creepy boy, creepy ""ring"" like girl, the two-dimensional characters...and not to mention the plot holes, which I won't ruin by going into detail. I found it quite amuzing, actually, due to the fact that several people were terrified of this typically predictable flick. There were too many unnecessary characters just there to have time added on in the movie to draw out their death, more-or-less. After all, this movie only tallied at a total of 96 minutes. ""Oh, we only have an 80 minute movie!"" ""Let's add a random character in, away from the plot of what's going on and ex him/her off after 5 minutes of scary music and what-not like we do in the rest of the film."" ""Good idea!"" ""The Grudge"" just overall did not deliver, and the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 in my book was that it defied a very sacred place most people afraid of the boogeyman/ what-not go to when in a scary situation, (which if you ever see this god-for-saken movie will see) and, of course, the appearance of Clea DuVall (13 Conversations About One Thing). I'm sorry but the girl is amazing, and this goes in the ""Why did you do this movie?"" category with ""Ghosts of Mars."" The finale/conclusion happened so fast too, I could hardly catch what was going on and when analyzed it afterwards realized that maybe it went by so fast trying to show 'images' explaining what happened so that the audience would be confused but so wrapped up in the film that they wouldn't think of it's plot holes, but it was just a build up for me that did nothing but make it worse by ""not explaining all of what happened."" The concept, itself, really isn't as appealing either--Someone dies, they hold a grudge, their spirit lingers and kills all who gets in it's way--isn't near as original/exciting to me as You watch a tape, seven days later you die mysteriously, or You're blind your whole life and after getting a cornea transplant are able to see ghosts--Yes ""The Ring"" and ""The Eye"" had plot holes too, but not near as many as ""The Grudge."" ""The Ring/Ringu"" was artistically innovative in its shots in a sense and had good performances, ""The Eye"" was even better with it's haunting illusions, terrifyingly creepy score and even very touching moments of human emotion and the path between life and death, ane the love we have for one another, but because I have to make this short- ""The Grudge"" was a waste of my time, money, and by the end of this movie I was holding something far beyond a grudge....2/10",The Grudge

The focus is on her supernatural buddies and they are scary as hell. By the end of the film, you're afraid to move and you realize that this one was actually much scarier than Ringu/The Ring. The other actors, like Gellar, do a horrible job (esp. her boyfriend - 'Karen, are you okÃ¡y?!'), but that's a good thing, because it's the only way to divert yourself from the terror and giggle every once in a while.

They seem to have based it on the jump tactic- having sudden things happen at calm, unsuspicious times. The other thing they did was they added some gore, but it wasn't violent they just showed some gruesome sights, these scenes were kind of creepy but not enough to make your heart race. The other not so good part of the movie was that the ghost was very unrealistic, it looked very animated. I myself feel this movie wasn't very scary but if you are an amiture then it is a good place to start before jumping into truly scary movies, but if your not easily phased then i would skip this one if u crave a true scare, but if you aren't in the mood for a really scary movie then go and give it a shot.",The Grudge

I hadnt seen any Japanese versions or hadnt even seen a trailer for this movie. So of course, I entered the cinema in anticipation of it being just your average horror movie, based on the fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the starring role :P.I was pleasantly surprised. I am a lover of horror movies and its a rare case that I am scared during a horror movie but this film truly scared me to the point that at times I was praying in my head that the person currently in the house wouldn't go and enter the room with the cupboard in it and I even found myself looking away at times when you get the music build up. It was really that scary for me and the mean croaking noise is nothing short of haunting lol, the noise just makes it so much more spooky.The storyline can be confusing if you aren't paying attention but I found it pretty easy to follow, even after some confusion when Sarah Michelle Gellar is watching the other man's story of being in the house as if she was walking round the house aswel (if you haven't seen it yet then and you are going to then you will see what I mean).Overall it is quite a good movie and worth seeing, as it is so scary. I left the movie and said to my girlfriend that I never want to see that movie again ever, not even on DVD because that noise just spooked me out to much and what would you know it, 2 days later (tonight) I am going to see the movie again with a friend lol. I just watched the trailer of the movie and now I am very nervous hehe, even after seeing the actual movie :P10/10 for just how scary it was for me (you personally may not get scared by the same things as me though in all honesty) and 7/10 for the interesting story, even after the unsatisfying ending.",The Grudge

574,offaxis,junk-food horror,3,13 March 2007,"As it seems my comment will be at the end of perhaps a few thousand, I doubt it will be read - but I need to vent.I love films which scare me to the core. This was not one of those films. Ordinarily I may have been able to enjoy it anyway, but the thing that drives me creeping up the wall like one of those crazy grey devil people is that this film was billed as being similar to The Ring. Now _that's_ a film that chilled my _soul._ And yes, I'm referring to the American remake of Ringu.For me, scares are about nasty surprises that kick in a fight/flight reflex. I'm comfortable in my assumption that there's no spider sitting next to me on my desk, so when I find that there _is,_ I jump. Just how much I jump seems to depend on how confident I am in my assumption. If I expect a spider to be there I'll be wary, but not as shaken when I see it.The same principle applies to films that I see. I'm always going to jump if a ghostly white face suddenly appears in a bus window. Or little scary grey spirits appear sitting idly in the corner of a room. The Grudge relies almost wholly on these cheap jumps - and after a while, once my nerves were shot, they became almost boring. Once I'm out of the theatre, however, I won't think about it again. There's no lasting feel of _dread._ So we get back to the comparison with The Ring and why that irritates me so much.The Ring was a textbook example on how to scare the pants of someone, and keep scaring them long after they've gone home. Perhaps some of this has to do with the fact that I went in expecting to see a formula Hollywood scary movie, but whatever. That film uses most of it's time slot preparing the audience for one brilliant fright. It winds us up, gets us scared using all the little devices, lets us think it's wound down and that the spirits are happy. Then little Aiden wants to know why his mummy let the ghost out of the well. ""You weren't supposed to do that, Rachel."" It's one line delivered by a small child in the light of day - and yet no film since has been able to terrify me as much.That said, one scene of The Grudge I really did like was the one with Susan in the elevator. The little kid Toshio appearing in the window on each floor without her noticing was tres creepy.Okay, enough.",The Grudge

And i think the only real prob i did have with it was that there wasn't much in the way of lines spoken in the movie, and haven't yet to see the movie that this was remade from I'm just takin maybe there wasn't a lot of lines spoken in that.. but it does add to the surrealness of the hole thing.but overall it was just what it was supp to be a scary movie. i came out of the movie happy and still talking about it.

576,habuso,Great Horror,10,11 January 2005,"I didn't expect much but was I wrong. I can only say that it is a very good horror movie. Maybe the storyline was too thin and could have been spread out better over the movie, but there are lots of great effects and the acting is good, although Bill Pullman doesn't do a lot of acting in the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a great job; I didn't once see her as Buffy. The obscure Japanese setting really works in this movie. It gives a great atmosphere to the movie If you liked the Ring and Dark Water, you must see this one. Actually the effects are better than in The Ring; the story though isn't. I can't wait to see the sequel The Grudge 2 (also Sam Raimi as exec.producer).",The Grudge
577,xtbfx,"Yes, you will jump, but....",5,22 October 2004,"you will know exactly when a scary part is coming up. That being said, this movie is quite predictable as to when the scary parts will be coming next. Example: when someone walks into a room you immediately think, ""Oh, that door is going to shut."" Guess what happens? The door shuts.The story behind the house is pretty twisted with the film. What I mean by that is the movie jumps around from different times and leaves you wondering if it's in the present or a flashback.The ending is just a let down.

The movie does not have a good script, actually it doesn't even have a script, but you have to be done of steel not to feel fear in very many scenes. I think this movie it's OK, the goal of it was to make viewer be scared, and it carried out it. Sometime you realize the film doesn't take you anywhere, it has nothing to say, it is all about a ghost's apparition, which truly scares you and makes you jump from your seat. If you ask me, you may want to see this movie because it will give you one and half hour of pure horror. If you want that from one movie, you'd better watch it. If you are looking for something else, just read a book",The Grudge

At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.If one forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie, he is again disappointed. The acting is OK but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning, while one is trying to get what's happening. But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand. ""Scary"" elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason...So...

581,ntquil,Death stares Sarah Michelle Gellar in the eyes..,4,23 September 2005,"""The Grudge"" is another movie where people watch a videotape and, because of an unforgiving spirit, all die pretty much identical deaths in the film. This time it's a haunted house in Japan. The film begins with a home nurse riding her bike, taking a brake from a sick woman named Emma she's being paid to care of. When she goes back into Emma's home, she's startled by loud noises in the attic, noises that are too large and deliberate to be an animal. She checks it out anyways.Expecting to find a serial killer or burglar hiding in the attic, she finds something much worse. After her boss can't get a hold of her the next day, he talks an exchange student named Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) into substituting for the ""missing"" nurse. Gellar has a bad feeling about this, but agrees to go.As we first see the outside of the house, there's lots shots of Karen reacting nervously to it as she walks up to the door. But it's not a scary house. Besides the black clouds hovering over it, it looks like a nice place.After Karen goes inside to find Emma on the floor, kicking incoherently, she puts her back to bed and starts cleaning up the dump. Emma isn't responsive to Karen and just stares at her. Even after staring, she stares some more.The attic starts making noises again. Karen goes to check it out. She finds a creepy little boy and his cat in a closet locked with maybe 50 yards of tape.. left or (placed)inside the closet is a mysterious journal that, later on in the film, just might help Karen figure what's going on and what it all means. The boy, like Emma, doesn't really talk, but acts creepy and stares. He stares just like Emma. Karen is no match for their staring.So we go into long flashbacks, where Emma and her family first visit the house to consider buying it. Emma checks out the attic first, while the family talks with the realtor. Emma's daughter comes up and finds her gazing non-responsively at the wall at something we can't see. After the rest of the family tries to snap her out of it, and fails, her son goes down to tell the realtor ""we'll take it."" Like I said, it's a nice place.A few days later Emma's daughter finds a cat on the staircase, that isn't hers'. Wouldn't that be weird if you found a cat in your house that wasn't yours'? Then a pair of ghostly arms grab that cat and runs into the attic. Emma's daughter, scared, goes to into the attic to check it out. The door shuts behind her.There's a scene where Karen (Gellar) goes to check on Emma and the ghost, for the first time, manifests itself to Karen, hovering above her with what looks like 50 yards of hair floating around the room. Karen is so traumatized by what she's seen she's taken to the hospital where she's later asked by her boyfriend, ""What happened?""... Karen sort of looks at the ground and shakes her head, ""It's that house. There's just something in there."" So I guess now that Karen has figured out there's something strange in the house, she looks up old newspaper articles and discovers something sinister about the houses' history. 3 years ago, there were 3 deaths including a cat. But another man also killed himself the very next morning. A man that lives close by. This man looks familiar, he's in the journal that was placed in the closet. This eventually leads Karen to other places and things that explain why the house is haunted and why people are dying.Is this movie scary? If it is, it's in the scenes that use long silences that build tension, and loud, scary noises that make us jump by abruptly breaking those long silences. It's effective, but it feels like an exercise. I didn't care about what was going to happen, but rather when it was going to happen.One of the reasons Chinese water torture is so effective has to do with gaps of time prisoners endure while suffering the excruciating feeling of wondering when the next drop will come. I don't say this to draw a literal comparison between Chinese water torture and the quality of the Grudge. But here are, after all, a lot of Japanese people in this film that look Chinese... and are often drowned.-nyquil_addict",The Grudge

The ending was horrible, the plot left much to be desired and the acting wasn't all that great either. I was more entertained by the 12-year-old girl sitting in front of me jumping, screaming and clinging to her boyfriend throughout the movie. I would NOT recommend this movie to ANYONE...ever. I am someone who is easily scared by movies but this movie was not even close to being scary. I want my $8 back!!",The Grudge

The ending could've been better. Many parts of the movies were scarier than others, and the beginning was sort of confusing. The thing it most reminded me of was darkness falls meets The Ring. One thing I didn't like about this movie was (SPOILERS AHEAD) that if they knew the curse was in that house, why not destroy it? I mean the one cop tried that one time but he didn't have to go inside the house to set it on fire.. that could of been done outside too. Good movie to take the family Halloween weekend.

584,raygungothicart,"Disappointing, fell flat",5,9 October 2012,"I was never a huge fan of Ju-On, but I decided to give The Grudge a chance because I was at least into the atmosphere of the original. The Grudge, while spooky at times and with a few worthwhile jump-out scares, isn't really anything special. It seemed to be a bit too ambitious for its own good. While some films like Fight Club or Memento managed to pull off bizarre timelines without a hitch and gain critical acclaim, The Grudge attempted and failed to tell a non-linear story. The result was a mess of vignettes that were connected only by the same house and central theme.I would have rated this film much higher if it were possible to even try to follow. It defies conventional horror tropes pretty well and does a good job at straddling the border between American and Japanese horror. The fact that it was basically Ju-On but with white people and a lot more confusing was somewhat laughable, though.Overall, it was an incredibly ambitious attempt that didn't do much for me. I'm a huge horror fan but the fact that it was nearly impossible to follow the storyline and I just couldn't relate or bond with any of the characters, so there was very little emotion when someone died.I'd suggest skipping this one and trying something like the similar film The Ring or the Chinese horror film The Eye. This film and the original just don't really go anywhere exciting.",The Grudge

It fits the exact cliché of all of the other lame horror films coming out today such as ""The Ring"" and ""Darkness Falls."" All of the same story lines, same color filters, same lame acting, etc. I saw it and thank goodness I did not pay, since I snuck in to see it, with the awful judgment of listening to my friends. So many people paid to see this film, and that was way scarier than anything in the film itself. So many people paying to see this film is the reason why Hollywood puts out as many wasted garbage films as it does. I can't understand how anyone can look at these films and think to themselves, ""Wow that was so great and it's gonna be remembered forever in film history!""

Sure ""The Ring"" was much better but that's still not saying a whole lot either. I actually enjoyed this film it had its creepy moments, but wasn't as scary as I expected. Also it got a little bit too repetitive by the end. I just wish that directors could go back to making horror films the way that they used to. Begin by aiming for that R rating, most true horror fans enjoy gore, nudity, and language the three elements missing from this new breed of watered down PG-13 horror film.

Sometimes something would pop out when you least expected it. Sarah Michelle Gellar is an excellent actress and she plays a very convincing role. The scary characters{dead people} in the movie have brilliant detail to their horrifying looks. On the negative side their is no blood or gore in the movie. Some movie critics will think that the movie is not scary because it is bloodless. but do not listen to them the is a very suspenseful movie and it will send chills up your spine the the first twenty minutes of the film.

There was some scary parts that made me jump i think that everyone should rate this movie the best. I think that Sarah Michelle Gellar did an excellent performance in this movie. There could have been a little bit more scary part but there was a good story behind this and i hope that the producer could come out with another grudge and maybe this one would get a better rating on it. Some of my friends thought that this movie sucked b/c they didn't find it scary enough so they left in the middle of the movie. I think that all the people that enjoyed the movie should vote the let the world know that this wasn't a bad movie and it was made for the whole family to see it.,The Grudge
590,Rodthagodx,Honestly Not impressed,6,22 October 2004,What do you get when you combine The Ring and Nightmare on Elm Street I don't know but this mess comes close. Personally i wasn't scared once throughout this entire film. I originially assumed this to be a mental thriller but instead it turned out to be a bunch of cheap boo type scares. I really expected to walk away feeling good about the movie but I honestly just wasn't impressed. Sarah Michelle Gellar tried her best to carry this movie but honestly there was just no hope. It had potential but just didn't make it unfortunately. I had a good story but the combination of poor acting with a semi decent plot there was just no good chemistry at all within the film. It's good for a group of highschoolers/ middle schoolers but as an adult I don't think you'll be impressed. I see it as a great film for the kids but nothing impressive for anyone else.,The Grudge
591,nathan-gabriel,A tired story pushed with poor acting and predictable scares.,3,14 April 2005,"Sarah Michelle Geller is horrible in this movie. As is the director. Why do movie directors feel the need to end horror movies with some sort of last scare? It's not scary anymore because it is so predictable and in the case of this movie it doesn't even make sense. It feels tacked on for no reason - which it is.The middle of this movie delivers some real scares, but not enough to make this worth watching. Don't waste your time or rental money.SIDE NOTE: In the special features section of the DVD Sarah M. Geller talks about how the house in the movie is another 'character' in the film. No it's not. And I am sick and tired of hearing people say that about movies. If anything has some type of importance to a film (like a soundtrack or a set) people call it another character!",The Grudge
592,PaOwen,"Potentially a scary movie, but ruined by advertising",6,22 October 2004,"My biggest complaint of the movie actually doesn't come from the movie, it comes from the advertising. Nearly all of the incredible scenes from the movie are given away in the trailers. I am not exaggerating either. On its own merit, The Grudge is a 7,8/10 film. Plot is generally non-existent, and it is all about the scares. Unfortunately, the morons behind production and advertising decided to ruin the one reason you'd have for going to see the movie.If you haven't seen that many previews, you'll definitely enjoy the movie more. Just keep in mind that plot is really not there. (That isn't necessarily a bad thing; the movie doesn't need some complex plot, so it doesn't have one. A quarter of the way through the movie, the entire plan of the movie should be spelled out for you. As long as you aren't expecting a plot like The Ring, in terms of complexity/depth, then the Grudge's lack of plot shouldn't bother you too much).",The Grudge

Personally, I'm a huge horror fan, there's a lot of movies that scare me to death, but then the night of the Grudge. No other movie in my opinion can reach such a spooky, disturbing, fightening, terrifying, creepy atmospheric level. If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you've seen The Ring and thought that was the scariest movie, see The Grudge, you will pee your pants until it leaks through. I give this movie a 10/10. I know that sounds like really crazy, but I thought the movie was really good and creepy that I really really like it. A definite Top 10 for my favorite scary movies.

It was more of an intelligent scary movie, with subtle scares, kind of like in the 6th Sense. And SMG was great, breaking away from Buffy and showing utter terror on her face without having to scream (anyone can scream). I highly recommend it, although, try and go either real late or real early,I had way too many teenagers in the theater acting like asses, and screwing up the scary parts. I will certainly go see it again before it leaves the theaters! I am a Buffy fanatic, but it was nice to SMG do something else.

The croaking noise Kayoko maid, had people laughing, but when we saw her face every one screamed! The Grudge was WAY better than The Ring and MUCH scarier, since the ring had one jumpy 2 second part. (when katie was shown in the closit)The cast was great! Sarah's performed was spectacular and was VERY freaked out by the woman.

There are a number of flashbacks provided to catch the audience up on past events, so fret not. This isn't a movie you will walk out of with a lot of questions, save one, ""Why do people in horror movies automatically lose IQ points?"" The answer to that is simple: If characters in horror movies were smart, there'd be no story. The plot is standard, but well-done. The characters are driven and as dense as they should be, considering this is a horror movie. The sound is expertly used to enhance the tension, as it should be, by underlying the scenes, rather than drive or create the tension. Any horror movie watcher is bound to be pleased by this fun, suspenseful story. The graphics were on par, and there's a number of very nice surprises with them.

The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best. Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. How does that scare someone? I can make that noise easily. Now don't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.,The Grudge
606,swalsh83,it will make you jump but so what?,2,25 October 2004,"Sure this movie had a few good scares. I don't mean the kind that haunt your dreams at night well after the movie is over, I simply mean the kind of scare you get when someone jumps out unexpectedly shouting Boo! Big deal. Anyone can do that. This movie lacked the kind of substance it takes to truly scare a person and for that reason it was very disappointing. I guess that happens when American movie execs try to recreate Japanese horror. Making a truly good horror flick is about so much more than weird camera angles and weird noises. Stick to Scream guys, you're much better at it.",The Grudge
607,oshtyman,"Good movie, so stop your crying",10,25 October 2004,"So I'm reading through the comments on The Grudge one day, and I'd swear I'm looking at reviews for The Godfather Part 4. This movie was never intended to be solid and plot-hole free. It was never intended to win Oscars or become the next Exorcist phenomenon. It was made to give everyone a little scare for Halloween. I always wonder why these people who hate the movie so much can still write 1000 words about it... I thought it was what it was and did a good job at it. I was impressed that it could keep the tension up for the entire hour and a half and I think that some of the scares were the best I've seen in a LONG time. Some people hated it, said they laughed at it, etc. Well nobody will EVER make a movie that scares everyone. It's impossible. I am much more likely to be freaked out by ghost movies than I ever will by a stalker movie. A lot of people feel the exact opposite. I'm not going to say The Grudge was the best horror movie of all time, but I will say that if you're one to be more frightened by the supernatural then the knife-wielding psychopath, there's a good chance that you'll find this movie frightening and very entertaining, I did.

This definitely did it for me. I'm a die-hard horror movie fan and this is one of the scariest - in my opinion - in that genre.Sarah Michelle Gellar (as well as ALL the other cast members) did a great job in her role. The audience was full when I went to see this (predominantly male) and I have never heard nor seen so many men scream and jump throughout a movie. It was also fast paced (versus the Ring) and it kept you on the edge of your seat constantly.

You think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future. Actually, it won't be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling Buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough, if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible.

I would guess so. In addition, I thought the movie didn't flow well at all. To much retrospective to current views. I was quite impressed with the horrifying make-up. I did laugh though when Yoko was walking into the Care Center and there was blood dripping everywhere. The person I was with said - Wow, she must have really gotten her period bad!!!

We laughed at Dawn of the Dead and snickered during the Exorist, however there was utter silence through the entire 96 minutes.If the beginning doesn't make you jump you may be dead yourself and while some claim there is no plot I say: What do you want from a horror movie? This isn't Troy or Gladiator, this is a downright scary movie made to keep you on the edge of your seat or place your hands over your eyes.The normal rules of typical haunted house movies don't apply and the usual hack and slash is non-existent, leading way for a creepy, dark atmosphere.

618,bridgetm36,I now have a grudge against Sam Raimi,3,1 November 2004,"I saw this last night. I went in prepared to be scared, or at least chilled. Instead I was totally disappointed and ended up laughing more than gripping the armrest. I'm really surprised by all the positive comments people are leaving. To each his own, but the movie I saw sucked so bad I have hickeys all over me. I guess I'm one of those wacky folks that wants a story to go along with the creepy music and spooky tar-mouthed baby ghosts. Otherwise it's just not scary or interesting. First of all I had a really hard time caring about the deaths (or lives) of any of the cardboard characters in the movie. I know that's not generally the point in a horror movie, but this is no slasher flick - it's in that ""art/horror"" genre where there's usually a little bit of character development. None to be had here. Didn't give a crap about the idiot sister hiding under the covers or anyone in her family or Sarah Michelle Gellar's wet-noodle boyfriend. (SMG did a great job with what she was given, but I would really love to see her use her talent in a good movie next time).And I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but if you're going to spend the time to come up with plot developments, then I really think you should resolve them somehow. Case in point: (Spoiler) The jaw of the caretaker Yoko was removed by the dead woman. Why? Oh, no reason. It just was. Oooh scary...And I wonder if the story line about Bill Pullman could have been any more vague and one dimensional. And why was his wife dressed like a drag queen when SMG goes to visit her? But the worst problem with the plot is the heart of it.(Spoiler) Any person who dies in a fit of rage causes others to die in that same place. Now, let's think about this for a second. Wasn't the HUSBAND the one in the fit of rage? Not the wife, not the creepy little boy. The wife was the cheater and the one who betrayed her spouse. She was probably terrified and not thrilled about getting murdered, but it doesn't make sense to say she was in a fit of rage. She was the victim. So why is she the one coming back to kill? It doesn't make any sense. Also, the plot was just boring. We're told that anyone who goes in the house dies. Then they all do in fact die. No contrast, no challenge. Just a bland carte blanche death sentence to all who enter the house. Blah.The movie a had a few good points. Some suspenseful moments, etc. But all in all, I and my friends (who are easily frightened) were pretty annoyed by the movie. I think the girl in the back of the theater last night pretty much summed it up when after the last scene she yelled, ""Oh HAYL no!""It was that bad.",The Grudge

It seems as though they had a good story but there was probably so much more that could have been done with it. Seemed like there were bits a pieces of good information that was left out of this movie. If you REALLY liked The Ring then I guess you will like this. Otherwise don't waste your money here.

NORMALLY when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the token mysterious paranormal type. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alert) when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through. NORMALLY at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood, or they've been freed, or whatever.Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly special-effects-laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done.Probably not the best sort of movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the ultimate sort of horror (nothing against 'em, they've got their place), but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions.",The Grudge
623,lovelyred705,God Awful,1,11 November 2004,"I thought this movie was horrendous, awful, stupid and incredibly boring. The Grudge is a movie of confusion, so the premise is that because people that were killed in a rage would leave a curse on the place they were killed. Fine, good idea, too bad the movie wasn't as good as the trailers and tag lines. If everyone that entered the house subject to the curse why did it take so long for Sarah Gellers character to die and why didn't they show the real estate agent dying. Also if the ""grudge"" was the one that killed than why did peter kill himself, it didn't explain. and why was the story only explained to the main character. Another thing is find dumb was the fact that the suspense was not maintained thru out the movie. one saw the deaths coming a mile a way, the music always came to early and was trying to hard to be eerie and the parts that were supposed to be scary were actually laughably funny, especially the part when the dead lady climbed in bed with the sister. I think the movie could have been more than what it was, it only did not try hard enough, unlike other movies it didn't try to trick us or offer some other sort of explanation, it didn't tease us with areas that you expected to be scary, it was pretty straightforward with the scare, and thats where i feel that it made its biggest mistake is when they didn't use opportunities to scare us psychologically, it didn't.",The Grudge
624,nineonethree,@#$!,8,1 December 2004,"There's so many things that I want to just scream right now, scream at the top of my lungs. Unfortunately, most of these things would be inappropriate for this forum and must be watered-down for the sake of social values. GRR!Anyway, let's get right to it.This is a good movie. Don't be fooled and don't let anyone else tell you any different. In fact, I'll even go so far as to say this is EASILY one of THE best horror movies I've ever seen. Now I absolutely understand that this isn't exactly the popular view right now so for all of you that are cringing and trying not to kick things or hunt me down to ""teach me a thing or two"" - don't get'cher panties in a bunch. I'm gonna explain myself.I've heard and read a lot of things, bad things, about this movie. ""Remaking Japanese horror movies is as big, and over-rated, as reality TV"", ""The plot is thin, or not there at all"", oh and the WORST of all is ""Where does the opening scene with Bill Pullman fit in?"". Oi...First things first - I've gotta be honest with you. I've never seen 'Ringu' ('The Ring') OR 'Ju On' ('The Grudge'). I've heard great things about them and I'm sure they deserve it too but I have no interest in reading a movie. That's why I watch movies in the first place - so I don't have to read. ESPECIALLY when it comes to movies like this! Horror movies are, by nature, visually driven. If I'm busy reading subtitles to tell me what's going' on I'm not gonna get to fully enjoy the VISUAL experience intended to be had. Thus, let's take this really great movie and redo it in such a way that it will appeal to, and can be enjoyed by, more audiences (i.e. those of us that don't speak Japanese).And yes the plot IS thin. It's no different than any other horror movie out there. So what? It's a horror movie! It's not meant to win Academy Awards or make you ponder some of life's greatest mysteries. There's a whole separate genre for plot-driven movies. They're called dramas. Horror movies are meant to scare you and make you jump. And even if it doesn't make you jump there's something addictive about that rush of adrenaline you get when you know SOMETHING'S about to happen. It's fun! And who doesn't think that little boy is pretty creepy? Or the jerky movement that ghosts have taken on in horror movies of late? Gives me the willies just thinking' of it!And finally, if you don't understand the significance of the opening scene with Bill Pullman, I don't know what to tell ya. I mean I COULD tell you but, you should be able to figure it out for yourself.So to sum it all up, The Grudge IS a good movie. It's a GREAT horror experience that has plenty of creepy images to settle in your head for quite some time. You'll jump all up out your seat once or twice (or more if you're like my girlfriend). Just enjoy it. Don't try to make an epic out of it. Just...let it be, and enjoy it.",The Grudge

In the mid-90s, it was Scream that started the trend of horror movies starring the hottest teen hunks of the day with plots that seemed to be self-satirical or one of the least important aspects of the film. Now, in the mid-00s, a new trend has emerged. In my mind it started with The Ring, but the true starting point is probably up for grabs.Horror directors these days seem to think that by throwing a bunch of weird, off-the-wall images and concepts on the screen, that somehow this will translate into a scary picture. Unfortunately, it does not accomplish this goal. While the shock factor may be high in movies such as The Grudge, as soon as the lights come back on in the theater, the fright is gone and I, as an audience member, am left unfufilled. That being said, The Grudge was not the worst of these type of films, and I thought it did have a few interesting plot points.

Oh no.",8,7 December 2004,"Reviews of this film which involve some element of comparison with The Ring are inevitable, and this is no different (Comparisons with The Grinch are less usual, and again, this is no different). There are certainly stylistic similarities to The Ring and its Japanese predecessor (The appearance of the films primary béte noire, for one). Whereas that film is concise however, wrapping a simple idea fairly neatly, The Grudge, like any unwelcome guest, leaves a bit of a mess. Criticism of this film may also revolve around its undeniable usage of horror genre clichés (See title). On the other hand, I think the fascinatingly mind-jolting ever-so-slightly-alien style of this movie more than compensates for this. The haunting images, (Don't even pardon that pun, shoot, shoot me now) combined with the plethora of strangely teasing loose ends leave parts of the film replaying through the mind over and over again. And ultimately, it is tense, and it is scary, which is why you're going. If you're after character development, or uniformly high-quality acting, (Back to acting school with you, Ms Gellar) see Finding Neverland, perhaps.

636,DancingKid500057,how bloodthirsty are you?,5,21 December 2005,"I watched this film in the last I.T lesson of the year, and spent the majority of the time hiding behind my eyes with the other girls in the class. I would not have even chosen to watch this film if it hadn't been a democratic vote and I hadn't got a load of bloodthirsty people in my class. But i have so I was stuck with it.The film starts alright, from memory a woman wakes up just in time to see her husband to throw himself over the balcony, thats alright I an deal with that, but then the story seems to jump to different places and times constantly, not allowing a plot to develop.As my I.T lessons are only an hour long I didn't see the entire film, but what I saw was enough to put me off, a monotonous plot that seems to only consist of people walking in a house, seeing something and screaming in fear. In some cases the Grudge follows the characters elsewhere e.g. to work.I think the music in the film, is probably the best aspect, it enhances the development of each scene and adds some interest to some of the more boring areas of the film. I could tell this from hiding behind my eyes, being told by the boys when the scary bits were! So in conclusion, only watch this film if you are heartless, fearless and love scary faces!

637,flowerchild6366,One of the best horror films I've seen!,10,2 January 2005,"Only one word describes this movie: Awesome. This movie draws the viewer in and holds them from the first scene to the last. As some may know, this is a re-make of the Japanese horror film Ju-on. I own this movie and the original is much better than the re-make, but the American version is wonderful. I think that the Grudge is so good partly because the director from Ju-on is used for this movie. They left the story true to the original, unlike The Ring, which wasn't anything like the original, Ringu, other than the main plot line. Anyway, back to The Grudge. The only thing different from Ju-on in this movie was that the main characters were American and they left a few scenes out. I'm glad that at least the setting was left in Japan. Over all, I'm very pleased with this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone.",The Grudge
638,mpbushman,Extreme deja vu!,4,14 January 2005,"If you've read about the premise of this movie and it sounds interesting to you, skip it and watch the original (Ju-On). The Grudge is such a carbon copy of Ju-On that I'm starting to suspect that the only reason it was made was so that Sam Raimi could enjoy a Nihon vacation and give his brother Ted a job. Just kidding, Ted Raimi is a fine character actor. Seriously, though, there really was no reason to make this movie except to cash in on the Ringu trend. It reminded me of the Steven Wright joke where he talks about somebody breaking into his house and stealing all his stuff, then replacing it with exact duplicates. Only in this case, the duplicates all happen to be American citizens living in Japan. And what's up with that, anyway? Is the point of view of this movie that if Americans decide to go live in Japan, they will have to contend with vengeful rage-ghosts? Does the tourism council even mention it? And fair warning, don't eat any rich cream soups or drink a large glass of strawberry Nestle's Quik before seeing it, as the slow motion belch sound effect that is so pervasive in the movie (both movies actually) is likely to have an ipecac like effect on you.",The Grudge
639,keonyn,Great example of what horror should be,9,3 February 2005,"Yes, it's PG-13, and no it's not excessively bloody and gory. This is exactly what a real horror movie should be. Relying on messy gore and violent men with a lot of makeup and a cheesy story is rather weak in my book. This movie is not a slasher, and that's why I liked it. It's a movie that provides atmosphere and story, the two most important aspects of a movie that's meant to invoke the type of reactions one should expect from a horror flick. It doesn't follow the regular rules, so if you're out looking for the next big horror flick, or if it's the blood and violence you go to a movie for, then yes, you should probably look elsewhere. If you enjoy the types of movies that play on your mind and emotions, then I recommend giving The Grudge a look.",The Grudge

I had to keep the lights on for awhile at night when I was trying to sleep. Simple concept of the film, however, I had a good time.

But only because you created a self fulfilling reality in which you were determined to not care about this movie.I don't think The Grudge is spectacularly original. Most movies, especially horror movies, aren't. The test is to find something special and unique within the well-worn genre.The unique thing about The Grudge is that it defies the typical American horror relationship of ""if you can understand what is haunting this place, you can beat it"", or ""you only die if you've sinned"". The idea of using the Japanese notion of the curse, basically throws all that nonsense away and decides, hey, if you come near this place you will die. The Place Is Cursed, OK? Thats it.

Naturally, the ""alone time"" leads to instance after instance of seemingly intelligent people breaking all the Scary Movie rules. E.g., don't work alone, don't enter a room alone, don't follow strange noises. Your BASIC rules of survival as explained brilliantly by Jamie Kennedy. Did Buffy and friends miss those lessons? C'mon!

As for the acting, all actors look like they wanted to be somewhere else, which they better did. This is a very good example of marketing, make a good trailer and a cool poster and hope this will attract people to come and watch. Without giving them any entertainment what so ever.

This was one of the worst movies i saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And the end? It's an open ending... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. This movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you'll be scared.

If you have seen the Japanese version the American grudge wont be scary because its all almost reshot scene for scene but if you haven't your in for a fun ride just like my friend.the scares are similare to the ring but is a different type of movie.

The original Ju-on focused on creeping you out as well as scaring you were as this version while still a little creepy cant measure up to the original. It was changed for American viewers by adding cheap scares that last all of about 10 seconds were as the original one is EXTREMELY creepy.

The sets are well thought out, something that seemed most unsettling was the actual Japanese house that it occurred in, the mise en scene was very well planned out, and was indeed a little scary.I liked the little 'glimmers' of face you see throughout the movie, which created a general sense of mystery, which was obviously revealed later on in the film. The only thing that irritated me was near the end when The cursed one approaches the girl after her little observation, she had ample time to escape but no typical horror movie with the desperation, and inability to move oneself or partner, and to end up being caught...

However, it seems as if the makers of this movie simply took the exact original, copied it, and pasted American actors in as the main characters. They seem completely out of place in their Japanese environment. Most of the complaints I make about remakes generally revolve around the fact that the remakes are nothing at all like the original, however there was no imagination or originality in this movie whatsoever.

I think that ""the grudge"" would be it! I don't want you people to believe that i have a grudge against this movie... However, if you haven't seen it yet, here it goes: it's a story about a house that bares the curse of a slaughtered family, and basically kills ANYONE who enters it... The movie starts with the classic stupid curios girl wandering around in the house hearing funny noises,when she gets grabbed/eaten/whatever by a scary woman-like ""thingy"". Then Sarah Gellar gets in the center of attention, by witnessing the murder of the old lady, by the matter-less hand of the house spirit. After that, the pieces and sequences run pretty incoherent in a dazzling vicious circle, not letting the viewer the chance to put the pieces together and figure out what is actually happening. As the movie advances, the curse is finally revealed, BUT, there is nothing poor ""Buffy"" can do to stop her inevitable death that is drawing closer and closer.Conclusion: Plot: a house that kills everybody, there's nothing anybody can do about it! WoW!! FX: so and so, though the purring lady made me laugh quite a few times Sequencing: really bad Suspense: almost none - very predictable horror action Acting: good enough, considering the bad script, and bad camera angles.The reason that i gave a 2 out of 10 for this movie is because i truly enjoyed the sequence with the transparent door elevator going up and the little boy appearing at each and every floor.",The Grudge

Which it did, quite well. Now, I think the most impressive parts of this movie were the camera angles and the sound effects. It just gives you a shiver down your spine. You knew someone was going to die but it would torture you horribly until they did. Again, I kind of missed the point of Sarah Michelle Gellar (wt hell?) but luckily she isn't in a lot of the movie. Just sit back, watch the movie (SILENTLY PEOPLE, it ticks the rest of the watchers off when you laugh and comment about the freak'n movie when you are watching it!), and enjoy the scare scene after scare scene. I was one of the lucky ones. I saw the movie and there were only four other people in the theater. And we were all scared senseless.

However, I went back and saw the film a second time with a group of my friends, determined not to wuss out again. My date's right shoulder was much more entertaining...The movie tries to create an atmosphere of foreboding evil and suspense by having maybe 20 spoken lines in the movie and music only at the most frightening parts. However, the lack of dialog also leaves anyone watching the film utterly confused. Throughout the film, people will randomly die and you have no idea who they are or why they are dying.Example: there is a woman who works in an office building at least 20 miles away from the 'evil house.' The monster from the evil house randomly shows up at her office building (empty, of course) and follows her home. All the while, I'm telling myself 'Well, its creepy, but what am I watching?' The movie does not even build the horror element, more of the something's gonna pop out and make you wet yourself element. Granted, there are parts of the film that will make you wary of being alone for a while, it utterly has the same effect as someone jumping from behind a wall: a second of shock and a few minutes of anger.When I watched the movie in the theater, the viewers were divided: there was the group genuinely frightened, and the group laughing at this pathetic garbage.Overall: the acting is horrid, the setting confuses me, there is no plot, and the music is nonexistent.",The Grudge

This movie displays the non-existent acting abilities of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the starring role as a ""house-keeper"" or something or other. The assignment she is given seems harmless until the people living in the house, and those involved with people living in the house, turn up dead. Also, a weird little boy is seen in parts of the house that have been closed off for years. In an attempt to complicate things, the plot also includes the origin of the curse placed on the house. All in all, the plot is only a front to stick as many ""don't-go-in-the-closet"" scenes as possible in one movie. This would have been fine except for the fact that all the scenes are shown in agonizingly slow and predictable style, with a scream, whoop, holler, or shriek around every corner. When the ""shocking conclusion"" finally comes around, you're to strung out to care, still trying to recover from the last random blood-curdling scream. Some of my more weak-willed and easily scared friends have called this movie the ""scariest movie of all time.""

If you want real suspense, a creepy atmosphere and the feeling of fear in the pit of your stomach, The Grudge is for you.Yanks living in Japan - not quite what the global audience might want to see. And Sarah Michelle Gellar is either wasted or unnecessary in her role, I'm not sure which. Seeing Bill Pullman always makes me wonder if a movie is really going to be any good, but in this case he is perfectly cast and not overused. There's one piece of expendable female eye candy, which American horror films are notorious for (Kadee Strickland), but at least she can act. For me, the various rooms of the house kind of represent the scenes within movie - you're not sure which room is which, and how they fit together , but you are sure the house is one really creepy place. Similarly, the scenes are placed out of sequence and feel disjointed, even blocky, but they all add up to a purpose - to continuously raise the level of fear and uncertainty within the viewer. This is not the kind of movie that tries to be too clever, twisted or trendy. It places fear first. It builds and builds in you, and makes you want to leave your seat, to give yourself a little relief. But if you stick it out, it might just be the horror film you've been waiting for.

There is something to be said for not trucking along, but every scene included too much of people moving at snail speed, breathing heavily, waiting for the next scary moment. I did think it was interesting how it did not follow a chronological timeline. The second aspect that I did not like was how everyone kept getting suckered into the same stupid scary movie mistakes. In my opinion a well done scary movie should be one that has people doing realistic things.Spoilers below: 1. In the part where the detective went to burn the house, he should have known better by that point not to investigate any weird noises.2. Susan was stupid to go to her apartment and be alone.

Unlike some of the other Japanese to American horror films, the movie stays in the Japan, and the reasoning for the curse relies on knowledge of Japanese culture or catching the one line in a small and somber conversation that when someone is killed in a rage, they will become a curse upon the living. In this case the wife killed by her enraged, jealous husband, and her son drowned by the husband in the same fit of rage, become a curse upon the house they lived in for anyone else that enters that house to never escape. The main character enters the house, sees the boy and the woman, and she finds the diary. You could say she investigates, but the investigation is just one web page, and then her having a small conversation with he police officer that says the previously mentioned Japanese belief. The movie needed to be longer. There needed to be more people cycling through the house, the first that just go unexplained and no one cares and slowly escalate to cases that really get the law enforcement to think about it. I realize that the original family that is now the curse upon the house were the same from the Japanese flick and there needed to be more time spent on the woman's affair. There needed to be a depiction of the wrong done to her and her son. So that for a time in the movie the audience would feel compassion for the woman and son and try to prod the main character on to helping the curse move on, to be free from being a curse. Since this is not a romance picture, there would be that turning point where the main character realizes that the curse cannot be lifted, and then the main character comes up attempts to end it. Which the policeman does, when he goes to burn the house down, and then the attempt has flops in it, and eventually you sense resolution, or not. Cut to a scene feeling all is resolved, and then the quick flick of the horror will never be gone. The last bit of the ""should've been"" was there, but the beginning part of the ""should've been"" is very lacking in the film. The lack of story leaves those untaught in Japanese culture not as terrified because of different belief systems. In ""The Ring"" you felt compassion for Samara, and she tries to save Samara, and then realizes, there is no saving Samara, so just save yourself. ""The Ring"" took the story out of Japan, and changed the content of the tape. ""The Grudge"" did not have to leave Japan, but it could have made us feel some more compassion for the woman and son. When the main character takes her ""boyfriend"" to see the Buddhist ritual, I actually thought she would try some Buddhist ritual to save the woman and son from being a curse. Sam Raimi, I enjoyed every other film of your's I have seen, and I hope that when you do ""The Grudge 2"" you create much more story, stretch it two hours.",The Grudge
670,Qawc,"I have some unanswered questions about ""The Grudge""",7,13 October 2005,"If ""The Grudge"" is suppose to get everyone that enters the house - why didn't it get the assistant to the policeman, the photographers, the finger print people, etc.. Why didn't the movie show the crime scene investigators being killed by ""The Grudge"". The assistant to the police man that was killed even went upstairs with him to find the phone and he wasn't killed in the movie. Any one besides me noticed these things? I also wondered why the sick mother wasn't killed immediately - it seemed like ""The Grudge"" allowed her to live and die later on in the movie. I was also confused as to whether or not the boyfriend of Geller in the movie was allowed to live or not? Also does anyone know if the original version is for sell with English sub-titles or voice overs? I thought it was a pretty good movie but it left me wondering about so many things in the movie. Why was ""The Grudge"" lady in every picture with the professor - Did he know she was in love with him? Why didn't he notice her following him so she could be in the pictures? Would someone please help me understand the movie better.",The Grudge
671,mycrzylife26,Scared !!,10,6 November 2005,"I went to the store to look at movies on DVD and I was mainly looking for a good scary movie. I saw the movie, The Grudge, and I remembered I had heard, from a lot of other people that it was a good movie to see so I decided to purchase it. I saw a couple other movies which looked like good ones to get, but I figured I didn't want to spend all my money in one place. So after enough debating, I chose The Grudge and White Noise. both good movies. I had previously seen White Noise and decided to get that one since I had liked it from viewing it previously. The Grudge was one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. I would recommend anyone to see either one of these movies. I definitely got what I expected to get.... a good scare !!",The Grudge
672,nemi_666,Really bad,1,14 November 2005,"this must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen.. I was sitting in my chair waiting for the movie to end so I could go to sleep.. and no, I wasn't tired to start with, and it was in the middle of the day, right after i got home from school, a not to stressful day, I might add.. I mean, where is the horror? where are the scary part to make my heart go jump up into my throat, and where is the part where I put my pillow in front of my face, and refuse to watch because it is too scary to watch? if this is what they are going to call horror movies from now on, I'd rather go watch Cartoon Network.. its more scary things going on there...",The Grudge
673,grudge904548834,undoubtedly the scariest film ever!,10,18 December 2005,"the grudge is without a doubt, truly terrifying! not only did i lose sleep after seeing the preview on Halloween day, but, it haunted me for days after. the other thing i like, is that it challenges your thinking by giving us a very difficult and complicated plot, but, that doesn't spoil it, it just enhances your thinking. trust me on this film (i'm training to be and expert critic and screenplay writer) it SCARY! with overall good acting and a unique score, it also delivers nearly 2 dozen scares! true masterful film-making. i'd chose this over the ring any day. it's also great to see for the 1st time ever, the director of an original movie come back for a remake, which makes this film even more great. filming in japan seemed to do even better for the grudge because it kind of made you feel awkward, especially watching Karen Davies (gellar) trying to fit in. if it was made entirely in Hollywood, i predict it might've failed, as we probably would've got another modern horror, but, filming away from the usual territory has almost made it look ancient and mythical. the grudge is the stuff of nightmares and nothing will come close to it, except perhaps for the sequel.",The Grudge
674,sanjeev_serene,"appalling,horrifying,staggering,repulsive,Gothic,...all u can describe this movie",10,19 December 2005,"it not only scared the s**t but every possible thing out of me. it is the first horror movie that ever made my heart thump,not even ""the exorcist"". it can be ranked with the greatest horror movies of the century.i never knew what silence and what slow paced background score would help to bring out horror in a movie. if u have seen the likes of ""psycho"",""the shining"",and felt that the background score could make a horror movie even more appalling,believe me,little background score and some great screenplay alone can make the movie(talking about ""the grudge""). i gave it a full ten to ten rating for it is arguably the best horror movie of this decade(till date).each and every moment is filled with tension.don't you ever miss such a great movie",The Grudge
675,pyssy_cat_06,c.r.a.p.,1,5 February 2006,"this movie isn't worth it!!!!i'm serious, i was expecting something really awesome, and most of all SCARRY.....i remember one of my friends gave me the movie, and i even watched it with the light turned off, but neither that way affected me with anything. apparently i'm not allowed to use the words i need to describe how this movie truly was!!! i don't understand why in the world it has won an award....maybe an award for the worlds most pathetic horror movie ever! and do u know what really annoyed me?? the fact that i didn't understand how those two (the girl and the little boy, i can't remember what their name was) killed their victims....????how did they do it, all u get to see is them opening their big mouths and making these crazy cheap sounds that anyone at home can do. i don't even know what i did with the CD but in case i find it....i'll throw it away!! GUYS, u wanna watch a scary movie???i mean, a real scary movie?? watch SAW or THE RING....that's scary...not this crap!...that's just my opinion, don't take it too personally:P",The Grudge
676,mattthewd-11818,Jumbled confusing mess,5,14 January 2020,"It was difficult to enjoy the film due to its seemingly random plot which only makes sense in the last twenty minutes or so. It isn't a 'mystery' enjoyable to unravel like The Ring (2002), it is confusing for confusions sake with an unrewarding explanation.Other than that..... the acting, characters, and effects were all decent. It was a little on tame side, even with the unrated version.",The Grudge
677,gadir-1,a jewel in the history of scary movies,10,11 March 2006,"Ever since Carpenter's ""Halloween"", I was disappointed with so-called Horror Movies: there was a quick trends towards splatter & gore, without any subtleties at all. So that when a friend ask me to go watch ""the Grudge"" I was rather reserved: I'd seen the Japanese original, as well as ""The Ring"" both the American and the Japanese version and neither of them had given me the creeps, though the lack of chopped-off hands & feet, or too predictable shock effects were definitely a nice (unpredicted ;) surprise. Don't get me wrong, though, the original ""Ju-On"" is a brilliant movie in itself, but it is just not scary and ""The Ring"" is just plain boring.So, as I said I was very reserved and, to be honest, even more so knowing that Sarah Michelle Gellar starred as the main character: I considered her far from being a good actor. In fact, my friend only wanted to see the movie because he's such a fan of Sarah. Well, he got me to watch the movie in the end and, boy, was I in for a surprise: AFTER ALL THE WAIT A REALLY SCARY MOVIE, FINALLYFor all the fans of blood, intestines, torture and whatever: go watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - this is no movie for you! This is a movie to feed your paranoia, your fear of darkness and of empty houses. It makes you watch the door to your cellar or the attic with goosebumps, lets you hear sounds in the night and makes you feel watched from behind. In short: IT GIVES YOU THE CREEPS.Notably, the movie does not rely only on the subtle effects of old movies to build up tension: not just quick glances of creeping shadows to hint at a monstrosity. You'll get all that, but sooner or later you'll be confronted with ""the monster"" face-to-face: no highly sophisticated latex Hollywood masks (that are more funny than scary), no rotten flesh and all that stuff, but still VERY SCARY (don't ask me why though).I must admit, though, that some of the surprise effects are very predictable, as many critics have observed before me. And yet, you won't mind them, because as opposed to many of the other movies where there is just the odd dismembered hand floating into screen to give you a quick scare without any real ""justification"" in the story, these shock effects just belong there: they are not scary because they are ""surprising"", but because YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T AVOID THEM. And finally, Sarah Michelle Gellar turned out to be a convincing actor after all ;)I bought the DVD the moment it appeared on the market and later also the Director's cut (which is not worth the extra money, unless you haven't seen ""Ju-On"" or liked it better: it is much closer to the original) and I MUST HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE 5 TIMES BY NOW AND IT IS STILL CREEPY.If you're looking for subtle scares and, like me, are longing for the ""good ole"" creeps of early horror movies, this is just the film for you.",The Grudge
