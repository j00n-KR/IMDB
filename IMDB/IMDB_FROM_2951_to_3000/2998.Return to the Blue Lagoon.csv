0,bkoganbing,Misleading title,5,22 April 2020,"Although the same character names are used for the two kids, this is by no means
a sequel to the Blue Lagoon film that Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields made
a decade earlier. A lot of plot changes but this is the same story of kids growing
up on their own on a south sea island.This pair who grow up to be Brian Krause and Milla Jovovich have a bit of bringing up from a woman who is cast adrift with them played by Lisa Pelikan.
They learn their ABCs from her if not the birds and bees. In a lot of ways
Pelikan is the best in the flm with her portrayal of motherhood.When civilization comes calling finally it's not quite to their liking. That makes
the biggest difference in plot.Return To Ther Blue Lagoon is not near as good as the 1980 fim, but it wasn't
deserving of all the Razzie nominations it got.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
1,Leofwine_draca,Lukewarm leftovers,4,21 July 2013,"RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, made 11 years after the successful first film, is one of those movies that's happy to reprise the plot of the original while adding a few twists and tweaks of its own. It's an entirely superfluous kind of film that sees yet another couple of kids washed up on a desert island and having to fend for themselves against nature and their fellow man.There are a few differences here - the adult with them is a woman, the boy is the son of the couple from THE BLUE LAGOON, they're staying in the same place so make use of the already-there house, etc. - but none of them make a difference. Once again the film is all about puberty, isolation, love and family, except as it's not original it feels like a lukewarm rehash of the first movie.The acting doesn't really sit right either. The age gap between Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause is too obvious, and Krause is as equally wooden as Christopher Atkins before him. Jovovich definitely has something feral within her, but less use is made of that as in THE FIFTH ELEMENT, which handled her unique qualities perfectly. Director William A. Graham made a career of TV movies and although RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON had a theatrical release, it feels very much like a second-rate outing in every respect.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
2,SnoopyStyle,back to the beginning,3,11 April 2016,"Richard and Emmeline Lestrange die leaving their son Paddy as the sole survivor. The rescue ship is overwhelmed with suspected cholera. Mr. Kearney, Mrs. Sarah Hargrave with her daughter Lilli, and Paddy renamed Richard are cast off in the lifeboat. Kearney threatens the toddlers and Sarah kills him. The trio ends up back at the original island. After Sarah's death, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause) are left to themselves.The story gymnastics are annoying as heck to make the sequel basically a repeat of the original. I'm sure anybody would be laughing with derision at the silly plot repeat. The original has the possibility of being a guilty pleasure. This is an unforgivable embarrassment for anybody who actually likes the sequel. I have nothing against the two young actors. Milla obviously has more acting abilities than the usual model. However, there is simply no point to this sequel for an unworthy franchise.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
3,sunwarrior13,A More Idiotic Sequel To A Dumb Classic,4,7 January 2012,"This sequel to the surprise box office hit The Blue Lagoon.It mimics its predecessor's romantic adventure formula of a lush tropical locale inhabited by scantily clad, nubile teens discovering their sexuality. This romance and adventure film stars Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause.It is produced and directed by William A. Graham. The screenplay by Leslie Stevens was based on the novel The Garden of God by Henry De Vere Stacpoole.The film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. Their life together is blissful, but not without physical and emotional changes, as they grow to maturity and fall in love.Spotted adrift in a boat with his deceased parents Richard and Emmeline, a baby boy is rescued by a passing ship. Adopted by the widow Hargrove, infant Richard is soon at sea again after he, his new mother and her baby daughter Lilli abandon ship in the face of a cholera epidemic. Washing ashore on the same island populated by the first film's heroes, Hargrove protects and raises her young charges until a disease also claims her life. Years pass and both Richard and Lilli become young adults. While Richard discovers his manhood by racing a lagoon shark and spying on the island's dangerous natives, Lilli becomes a woman with her first period. Eventually their raging hormones lead the two into each other's arms. Marriage and a pregnancy follow, but Richard and Lilli's union is threatened by the arrival of a ship carrying a lovely captain's daughter with eyes for the loincloth-clad Richard.The Fijian background looks pretty, but there's no escaping the fact that the tropical flowers and trees seem smarter and more appealing than the people.The visuals are the only good thing about this movie. And nothing else. A testament to that is the Razzie nominations it received which are the following:Worst Director - William A. Graham Worst New Star - Milla Jovovich Worst New Star - Brian Krause Worst Picture - William A. Graham Worst Screenplay - Leslie Stevens Young Artist Awards: Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture - Milla JovovichAlthough it never won any award,it still reflects how poor this sequel was to a dumb classic movie.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
4,preppy-3,Well...the photography was nice!,1,7 July 2002,"Why did I even watch this movie?  How good could a sequel to a Brooke Shields movie be?  The original was no classic but it was bad enough to be enjoyable, had beautiful photography and plenty of sex and nudity.This sequel isn't bad/good...just BAD!!!  It has no nudity or sex (hence the PG-13 rating) but it does have nice photography.  The plot is so ridiculous I won't even get into it--you can read the plot synopsis on the title page of this ""movie"".Brian Krause and Milla Jojovich are good-looking and have nice firm bodies but are even worse actors than Shields and Christopher Atkins in the original!  I know that's hard to believe, but it's true.The low points of the film:  the movie trying to teach the kids about sex; the kids discovering a native tribe on their island after SEVENTEEN years (!!!); the attempts at acting; the script.The high points:  there aren't any.Avoid at ALL costs!!!",Return to the Blue Lagoon
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Deserted, indeed",5,4 January 2011,"The two from the first are dead(...well, that's a bummer), discovered by a ship. Soon after a woman is sent away from it with her infant daughter and the son that did survive sequelitis, and the three end up on an island paradise(and yes, we do get nice photography of the exotic setting, and it's one of the few pluses in this). After half of this passes at an utterly drab pace, the mother dies and we get what I understand is essentially a remake of the original(which I have not watched, and I also have not read any of the books), and lesser. And the last 25 minutes, because the people behind this don't dare let the two leads be by themselves, ""civilization"" in the form of a seductive girl and unappealing sailors arrives and have us questioning... who are the true savages in this? That admittedly is somewhat interesting, if ill-executed. This can be pretty moralizing at times, and it awkwardly goes back and forth between making fun of Christianity and trying to promote it. There is some realism to dialog and gender roles, if they are also stereotypical. The attempts at comedy tend to be lame and ineffective, with a few exceptions. There is some tension. The acting is fine. I like Krause even if he isn't the greatest talent, and Milla, in addition to being cute, hot, beautiful, stunning and so many other similar terms(you can probably tell why I gave this 90-some minutes of my life) is a quite decent actress, and was back then. There is a bit of sensuality and a little nudity in this. The DVD comes with trailers for both of these. I recommend this to those who want the visuals, be it the location or, like yours truly, Jovovich. 5/10",Return to the Blue Lagoon
6,Wuchakk,Growing up on an isolated island with a youthful Milla Jovovich,7,28 June 2021,"In 1897, a missionary widow (Lisa Pelikan) and two toddlers are stranded on a paradisal island in the South Pacific. As the kids grow they learn about the wonders and dangers of life on their remote isle, including the birds & the bees. Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause play the two youths while Nana Coburn is also on hand.""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" (1991) is the sequel to the 1980 hit movie, but bombed at the box office, likely because it's basically a retread. I prefer this one for various reasons; including the entertaining last act and the simple fact that I favor Milla over Brooke Shields (the latter never did anything for me). Both movies were based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole's trilogy, although this one deviates more than the first.There are similarities to Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""Tarzan of the Apes,"" which suggests that Burroughs was influenced by ""The Blue Lagoon"" since it debuted in 1908, four years before ""Tarzan"" (although Burroughs claims that his only inspiration was the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus). (Why Sure!).This is a well done and realistic island drama/adventure/romance and doesn't deserve its bad rap. If you like movies involving castaways, like ""Mysterious Island"" (1961), ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan"" (1984) and ""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998), it's a must. This one just lacks the fantasy or farcical elements and is more akin to ""Crusoe"" (1988) and ""Lord of the Flies"" (1990).The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot on Taveuni Island, Fiji.GRADE: B.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
7,JamesHitchcock,"The world needed a sequel to ""The Blue Lagoon"" like it needed a hole in the head",3,28 July 2021,"How would you make a sequel to the 1980 version of ""The Blue Lagoon""? Well, my view is that the world needs a sequel to ""The Blue Lagoon"" like it needs a hole in the head, but if I were commissioned to write such a sequel and could not get out of the commission, it would go something like this. Richard and Emmeline are found alive, rescued and are taken back to civilisation, where they discover that they are heirs to a fortune. Their wealth, good looks and the remarkable tale of their survival on a desert island make them the most famous couple in America and they are in great demand everywhere in high society. They, however, hate their new lifestyle and find high society superficial, hypocritical and cruel. They quietly abandon their new life and return to their tropical island with their son to live out the rest of their days there.In the sequel that we actually have, Richard and Emmeline are found dead, even though the ending of the original film implies that they were found unconscious but alive. Their baby son (called Paddy in the original film but Richard here) has survived, however, and is rescued by the ship's crew. An outbreak of cholera on board leads to young Richard being cast adrift along with a widow named Sarah Hargrave and her baby daughter Lilli. Eventually the three end up back on the same tropical island where Richard's parents grew up. Sarah (whose husband was a missionary) does her best to bring the two children up as good civilised Christians, but when she dies a few years later they are left on their own, just as the elder Richard and Emmeline were.From this point onwards, the scriptwriter of ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" seems to have abandoned any pretence that he was writing a sequel and to have decided that it was easier to write the script for a remake instead. The adventures of Richard II and Lilli closely parallel those of Richard I and Emmeline, scene for scene and at times almost word for word. The leading actors, Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause, seem to have been cast on the basis of their physical resemblance to Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. Only towards the end does the plot start to differ from that of its predecessor.I have never been a fan of the 1980 ""Blue Lagoon"", which I found just another sentimental teenage romance movie with an exotic setting and with wooden performances from its two young stars. Here Krause is perhaps rather less wooden than Atkins, but Jovovich is just as bad as Shields was. Shields had the dubious distinction of becoming the first-ever winner of the Razzie Award for ""Worst Actress"". The 1991 film was nominated for five Razzies, including ""Worst Picture"", ""Worst Director"" for William Graham, ""Worst Screenplay"" for Leslie Stevens and ""Worst New Star"" for both Krause and Jovovich. Surprisingly, it lost out in each category, generally to ""Hudson Hawk"". I have never seen that film, but if it is even worse than ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" I cannot say that I am in any hurry to do so. 3/10. (Objectively speaking, the film is no worse than the 1980 version which I awarded 4/10, but an extra mark is docked for the sequel's lack of originality).",Return to the Blue Lagoon
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,Why? I mean was a sequel that necessary?,3,3 December 2003,"The Blue Lagoon was a silent success with the audiences of 1980, not to mention one of the most controversial movies of all time. So, I guess the director just wanted to have the same amount of success, so he used the same story, just different characters.Unlike the way the first one ended, Richard and Emily are dead when they are found, but their son, Patty soon renamed Richard after his father is adopted by the only mother on the ship, Sarah who has another child, a daughter, Lily played by a new successful actress, Milla Jovovich. When the ship takes another tragic turn by getting torn down by sea, Sarah, Richard, and Lily land ""coincedentally"" on the same island that Richard and Emily lived on. The house has change a bit, but I guess it can't always stay the same, but Sarah raises the children more different than in the first film, Lily and Richard know the ways of nature and let their love blossom after Sarah passes from being ill. When civilized men finally come to save Lily and Richard they begin to question the meaning of what is truly civilized and what is not.Over all, I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it was just an unnecessary sequel. Because of the fact like I said, it's the same plot. Some great actors got their start though because of this film. So over all, I'm not going to give it a terrible rating, but the director could have thought this out a little more.3/10",Return to the Blue Lagoon
9,rivertam26,One of my all time faves,8,31 May 2020,"I feel like I shouldn't love this movie but I do. I wasn't a big fan of the original film a found it a tad boring and depressing bit I loved this sequel. It's more hopeful and engaging. Picking up right after the first film's events. The boat is found by a passing ship and only the baby has survived. The only woman on board takes charge of young Richard until suddenly they are forced off board with another crewmember, her daughter and Richard because there is an outbreak of cholera. After days at sea with no hope the crewmember tries to throw the children overboard and she kills him. Soon after they arrive at the island from the first film and grow into a handsome Brian Krause (Sleepwalkers) and the gorgeous Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil). Along the way incidents happen and soon enough they are faced with civilization. It's all dramatically engaging, romantic and suspenseful at times. It all moves forward towards a thrilling climax. The movie is shot gorgeously with solid performances. It still holds up as a intriguing romantic adventure.Budget: $11m
Box Office: $2.8m4.25/5",Return to the Blue Lagoon
10,Falconeer,"Who were the real ""savages?""",7,20 January 2009,"It goes without saying that the plot device used to get Lilli and Richard to the Island is both preposterous and highly unbelievable. But what transpires once everything is in place makes this flaw forgivable. While Brooke Shields portrayed her character ""Emmeline"" as truly naive and innocent, Mila Jovovich amps up the sexuality of her character ""lilli,"" playing her coy, teasing, and as someone who is aware of her own seductive qualities. Chris Atkins likewise played on 'Richard's' innocent, almost infantile qualities, which gave the original film a more innocent and sweet feeling. Brian Krause seemed slightly arrogant in comparison. It seems like the world was a bit more naive in 1980 than it was in 1991, i suppose.. Anyway the island is as lush as ever, and Jovovich and Krause rival Shields and Atkins in their physical beauty, so in this sense, ""return..."" is a highly enjoyable film, especially to someone who is not familiar with the original. But in this sequel, civilization is put ""on trial"" when a group of civilized travelers invade Lilli and Richard's private paradise. In the end, these two innocents come across as more civil than the visitors, who treat their hosts like pieces of meat, to be ogled, toyed with, even raped and killed! This gorgeous film echoes the same message as the notorious film ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" in raising the question, ""Who are the real savages?' Of course this one is much easier on the eye, and the stomach than that notorious cannibal film. ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" is pure escapist cinema, that is in some ways, more sexually aggressive and graphic than the original, and does contain a bit more violence as well. For fans of Mila, this is an absolute must-see, as she is absolutely stunning in this, and is not as shy with nudity as Brooke Shields, who insisted on a body double. Sadly the DVD in North America is the horrible ""pan & scan"" format, which chops out some beautiful scenery, but for fans of this, the Euro DVD is in widescreen format. Not a great film, but certainly a pretty one.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
11,TheOtherFool,Likable to a point,5,4 April 2004,"The first Blue Lagoon was one of the worst movies of all time, and I actually liked this one better. The acting seemed a lot more convincing, in particular if you compare Milla Jovovich to Brooke Shields.
The first half hour of the movie is a build-up to the fact that they're actually on the island, and takes on a bit too long. When the mother dies the movie takes the same steps as the first one, with the two main characters discovering their own and each others sexuality.Then the movie takes a turn when our two cast-aways return to civilization when a ship comes by. Things complicate as a young woman is on board that takes a liking in Richard (Brian Krause), and a pirate-like guy who takes after Lilli (Jovovich) and her pearls.Although the movie is kinda losing it at this point (with gunshots and a shark-attack), I preferred it over part 1 (which was a bore). Just one thing: isn't Jovovich showing a little bit too much skin for a 15 year old?

12,rlcsljo,"Not quite as good as the original, but interesting",6,21 June 2001,"This film wasted too much time trying to get our heroes back to the island and the first half of the flick was almost an exact repeat of the same sequence in the first.  I really wanted to see the grow up again and not just see how they got lost--which was pretty standard in both films.  Of course the two castaways had to ""rediscover"" their sexuality--this is what this film is about.  The movie really changes into high gear when the children are re-introduced to civilization.It really explored the question--who is more civilized?Obvious comparisons: Brooke Shields/Milla Jovovich--looks: dead heat, although Milla showed more skin (she may have had more upstairs to show).  acting:  Brooke seemed to capture the innocence of unexpected woman hood (she was brought up by a male, not a female so she may have had less schooling)Christopher Atkins/Brian Krouse--looks: Chris hands down, Brian looked like a Pillsbury Dough Boy by comparison; acting: Brian had a slight edge, in that he had to act more ""grown up"".Amazingly both original and sequel are worth a watch:  The first for the story and acting; the second for Milla and a more interesting ending.",Return to the Blue Lagoon

Richard: You're right. Well stay here. Just the three of us. I love you, Lilli.""
The last lines as well as what Milla Jovovich said sum up pretty well what this essential and wonderful movie is about: ""I think that the idea of falling in love on a deep and spiritual level without the distractions of the material world will always be appealing.""",Return to the Blue Lagoon
14,jonathanruano,Return to the Blue Lagoon -- Bad films coming full circle,3,22 March 2010,"I can only think of one thing more incomprehensible than making a movie from a bad script and that is for a filmmaker to base his idea for a movie on another movie that is terrible. Normally directors try to rip off good movies, like the guy who directed ""The Italian Connection"" based on the ""The French Connection"" (good thinking because sometimes Americans confuse the French and the Italians), or the other fellow who directed the porno ""American Booty"" based on Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty."" And if all else fails, do a sequel like ""Jaws II"" based on the good ""Jaws"" or ""Exorcist II"" based on the great ""Exorcist."" I could go on, except I will be going off track and forgetting to tell you about the time when they decided to make the terrible ""Return of the Blue Lagoon"" based on the terrible ""Blue Lagoon"" which must have had the makers of sequels and rip offs scratching their heads.The problem with ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" is the same as the last film. It is not about anything. It seems that the filmmakers felt, in spite of the bad critical reception of the first Blue Lagoon, that an exotic island and two teenagers discovering sex and then fornicating (though we see none of that) was enough to create an entertaining film. Of course, the filmmakers did a little tweaking for this film. There is the sad background story which explains how the two kids got stuck on the island, like the last two kids. Who says that Carl Orff's Carmina Burana does not have any influence over film-making. There is also an egg competition, an encounter with a native, a seductive English girl from the outside and a lascivious sailor. But other than that, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause) go through the same motions as Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins as though they were destined to live the exact same lives as the previous couple on the island. What ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" really is, if you think about it, is an unsexy pornographic movie for kids; a stage for kids to go through before they see the softcore and hardcore porn films. But even based on that sordid criteria, ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" fails because even the sleaziest, worst acted pornos at least do something to your libido. ""Return to the Blue Lagoon"" does nothing because it has all the bad acting you would expect from a porno without any of any of the great sex (not least because the actors are underage). So if you are interested in a movie where a couple have lots of great sex on a deserted tropical island, watch Lina Wertmueller's ""Swept Away by a Mysterious Destiny in the Blue Sea of August"" instead. It has gorgeous pictures of a tropical paradise, far better acting, and you won't feel dirty and guilty by the end of the film because the actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, were both in their thirties (though they look like in the their twenties) at the time of filming.",Return to the Blue Lagoon

16,Dragoneyed363,"A watered down, cardboard cut-out of the original with not so satisfying edits",5,19 April 2009,"WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Okay, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved The Blue Lagoon and the only reason I gave this the rating I gave it is for their effort. Yes, I could tell they actually put in an effort to make this a satisfying sequel, but sadly failed.Well, I'm going to start with the beginning. I like how they began where the first one left off by finding Richard and Em dead floating in the boat along with baby Paddy who survived, though they had been in a completely different looking boat, not laying on their stomachs, had been found by completely different looking people and the people who found them's boat looked completely different, but still, they made an effort. On into where Lilli, Richard (Paddy) and Sarah are shipwrecked. I like how they showed them finding the home Em and Richard inhabitant from the first film, though if I recall the house was on the beach not half-way into the woods and the inside looked (using this word again) completely different, but still, I loved how the movie actually gave an effort. Also, I liked how they gave an effort to make Sarah a more compelling parent figure as Paddy was in the first and they actually accomplished that, I felt a little sad when she died and I did not care one bit when Paddy did.Well, then the rest of the film goes on and we see Lilli and Richard grow up. From then on out until about the last 20 or so minutes of the film are left, it is the exact same as the first! Nothing is new except the cast! Since this is rated PG-13 and the first was rated R, you get no actual compelling feelings and scenes as you did in the first, such as, in this you do not get to see the sex scene or any sex scene that leads up to their baby, when you did in the first and it made the film more touching and beautiful. The last 20 or so minutes as I said, they tried something new, and gave an effort by adding to the movie that people actually found the castaways on the island this time. I hated this change. Not because I hated the idea, they just went about it all wrong. So these people are landing on this island that isn't even on the map, as one of the passengers stated, why, the movie did not say. The idea that a very lady-like and civilized daughter would fall in love with this guy she just saw for the very first time on an island who has no interest in her at all and is uncivilized is very stupid and the idea that one of the crew members will deliberately chase Richard across the island to try and kill him just because they were what, in a fight, is stupid.At the very end, there is a baby born which you do not care about at all in any way because the film spent absolutely no time at all on showing it grow up whatsoever, which they did in the first, and then it goes off. I have wrote so much and spilled my heart out about this sequel because I absolutely fell in love with the first and I thought this was very, very disappointing. Like I said, I didn't give this a lower rating because it actually does manage to entertain at a lot of points and the actors captured their parts rather well, I guess. As you can obviously tell by now, I thought they gave an effort at trying too and I found that respectable, but overall this was totally unnecessary and just left me wanting so much more.

I had seen The Blue Lagoon only a few months before, and although I felt a little guilty by betraying my ""heroes"", I rented 'Return' anyway.  One thing I noticed is that it made a lot of repeat shots of the first movie.  Several scenes, such as one of the swimming scenes, and one of the waterfall slide scenes, and more, are repeated in this sequel.  One thing that disappointed me is that they gave the boy his father's name even though they had no way of knowing it.  The romance in this movie is compelling, though somewhat unprovoked.  One or two fights and dangerous escapades and they're all growed up and ready to get married.  But since they are sincere, it's alright.  Another disappointment is that they get married.  What use could marriage vows be in a place where no one else existed.  I also resented the portrayal of the island's tribal visitors as ""heathens"".  And, despite all these things, and despite the arrival and cunning of Sylvia, I still like this movie.  But I don't reccomend it if you are loyal to The Blue Lagoon.

24,Demonicaura,Wonderful sequel to a good movie,9,26 May 2011,"I had never even heard about the blue lagoon movies until about a year ago. After finding out that shields was in the first movie I thought that it might be kind of interesting since she was one of my favorite actresses however after finding out that there was underage nudity in it my first though was ""how could this be legal"" since my understanding was the underage nudity was not legal in the united states. I put that  thought aside and decided to watch the movie anyway. After watching it I Saw just how innocent the nudity really was. There was nothing sexual at all about it. About a month or so after watching the original blue lagoon I found out that there was a sequel and that this one had mila jovovich  in it, another actress of whom I knew from the resident evil  series. I figured that this one might be just a good as the first one and for the most part it was. I mean don't get me wrong this was a wonderful movie and the story line was well thought out but the innocents that we saw from the first movie was taken away. In the first movie they grew up not knowing about puberty, pregnancy, and what your body goes though during that time. In this movie both of the young children were educated about the changes that their bodies would go through when they hit the age of puberty. If you put that aside and just watch both movies you will see that they are both great movies to watch. I personally cannot see how people can say that this movie or it's original with shields in it are in any way borderline child pornography. Okay so what I mean yes we do see  a frontal view of mila jovovich's breasts and she was only like 15 or so in this movie and during the first twenty minutes or so there are numerous scenes in which we see a frontal shot of young Courtney barilla who is only like 8 or 9 at the time but it's not like it is  anything that we've never seen growing up so I personally cannot see how people are so bent out of shape about seeing it in the movies but to each their own. Putting that aside both the original and it's sequel were great movies and their story lines were well thought out. They are both worth seeing and in my opinion are a perfect family movie for all ages. Younger children might not fully understand what is going on in the movie and parents might have to explain some things but both movies are family oriented.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
25,OrdinaryfoolisNJ,Full of bad lines,3,14 August 2006,"I just finished watching the original Blue Lagoon. Then, tuned in here to read about the sequel. I read the lines from the film posted here, and nearly vomited. I'm sorry, but not one of them seemed realistic. Then I watched the trailer. Lines from the trailer:""Remember what mother said would happen when I became a woman?"" ""Yes."" ""Well, I've become one.""I almost want to see the film to so how much worse it gets. In fact I very well might. The original had a certain charm to it. It was not all about the nudity, and the lines were spare. It was about these two people having to get along while going through the growth process. That's what was interesting. When love and sex happened, it wasn't dirty in the original but rather a natural progression.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
26,workshyslacker,A Rehash of the first movie ... except for the last 25 minutes,4,3 April 2010,"*SPOILERS AHEAD* Call it morbid curiosity but I couldn't resist watching this sequel/remake/cash-in.The Bad 1. The Plot; (see the Good) A basic rehash of the BL as our Paddy gets rescued from the small craft the original BL couple Richard Snr and Emmeline were cast adrift in. Renamed Richard, his rescuing ship is now rife with cholera and his adoptive mother and her daughter, Lilli, find their way back to the original island. Plot devices repeated from the first film as his new guardian teaches the young children the facts of life and conveniently expires so that the young couple can go through adolescence, the discovery of love, sex etc etc much like the BL, except this time they are more knowing than the original couple. The wide-eyed innocence and charm of the first film is completely lost so the coming of age story had NO resonance. There were no important themes about life and death, parenthood, and familial love. Even the same scenes are repeated; the water-slide; swimming blissfully in the sea, love beneath a waterfall. I can't even comment on how Richard Jnr can outswim a shark (!) and his father couldn't but I'll let that one slide...2. Acting; Of all the criticisms against the BL about the poor acting from Shields and Atkins, this one is not any better. At least the first couple from the original movie had the excuse of having the mentality of eight year olds and their sparse, childish banter reflected this. This couple (Krause and Jovovich) say cringe-worthy pretentious things like ""There's a baby growing inside of me... a woman knows these kinds of things"".3. The Characterization; I never understood the motivations of these two except that they liked frolicking in the surf. At least in the first film one had the contrast between Richard Snr wanting to go back to civilisation and Emmeline who didn't, and the break-up in their friendship following Emmeline's failure to light the signal fire. The pivotal emotional point in the BL was when Richard Snr realised he had everything he wanted on the island and didn't hail down his father's ship when it did arrive.4. The Romance; Nope. Didn't feel it or root for the couple, especially when Richard Jnr starts making eyes at the new girl, pushing poor Lilli so far as to daub herself with clownish make-up and put some clothes on (!). In the first movie, Richard Snr rejected civilisation for his life with his new-found family.5. Cinematography; Bland. The first BL was much better and the underwater scenes felt magical.6. Music; Didn't really lift the scenes and barely noticeable except in the action sequences.The Good 1. The Plot; The last 25 minutes were interesting. A ""What If"" if ""civilized"" people came ashore. Well, they're not much better, being conniving strumpets, thieves and potential rapists. It also worked better as an action-adventure film than the first film.2. Social commentary for young ladies; make-up is bad, clothes are BAD, anorexia is even WORSE. Seriously, though, I felt sorry for Lilli when she tried to copy her rival for Richard Jnr's affections, going so far to put on make-up and clothes and refusing to eat. I didn't see the anorexia part coming...Overall, this film is barely adequate if you've never seen the first one. And if you liked the BL, you won't like its sequel. For those of you who enjoyed ""Return to the BL"", I urge you to check out the far superior original.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
27,sierrastar14,Pretty Good...,6,19 July 2012,"The first Blue Lagoon ended with Richard and Em being found by his father alive where as in this 1 they're found by someone else and only Paddy survives and that bothered me just a little bit. It was cool to see what they can do with the knowledge Richard and Em didn't have. I felt like this 1 was missing something that the first 1 had but I like that it did continue. However, all that being said, this was still a good movie, worth the watch but my least favorite out of the 3 movies. Acting is good. I bought this on ITunes and I really wanted to rent and it didn't have that option. After watching I still wish I could have rented. It's not so good that I want to keep watching. I could watch the 1st 1 over and over again. Can this be made for rent somewhere, though it doesn't do me any good now?",Return to the Blue Lagoon
28,Neville-6,Good theme but an miscentered plot...,6,29 July 2000,"I thought this film had a great theme -- lovers, children standing up and facing adversity... but the plot and dialog stressed a bit too much on sex, and marred the nice mood with a raunchy feeling.  I love how the two main characters were portrayed, but again the plot and dialog were miscentered on the topic of sex and the pacing was a bit slow and lackluster.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
29,tnt_123,This film rocks!,8,29 December 2004,"This film was absolutely beautiful. I can't understand so many people having a problem with it. Everybody says its horrible, why, what is so horrible about it? It made me wanna become more natural and relaxed, knowing that nature is truth and purity while civilization is corruption and a lie. This movie is definitely for Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause fans. Milla's acting seems very inexperienced and like she doesn't care about it, but that actually makes her seem more natural, although I wish she would be more professional. Brian Krause does an average job, but again when you watch the movie the last thing you think about is how the actors act. What gets you the most about this movie is its beautiful message about how a human being should be, beautiful and pure in all ways.I definitely recommend this film.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
30,graceewenm,What did I just watch,2,20 May 2019,"I saw this movie suggested to me by Netflix I decided I was going to watch it, with the hopes of it being a cute romance movie about a shipwreck and an island. This is not what I got. They spend half of the movie explaining the backstory of the two main characters. I didn't really need to know that much about their early childhood, I just didn't. Then the movie begins to show the main characters going through puberty. I looked up their ages the girl was 16 which is pretty close, but the guy was 22. I just don't understand what the person that was casting was thinking. Both characters look extremely old to be acting the way they did throughout the movie. From the beginning of the movie the mom noticed a boat full of people that were chanting and realized they showed up every full moon. The mom, for some reason unknown, knew they were dangerous and was afraid of them. I don't think I really needed that, and ended up getting more confused and added up making making the plot feel like to much and not using their time properly to fit that story line in. Also they low key did blackface(which I know the movie was shot in the nineties) but it still just felt like it didn't knew to be there.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
31,abdullahoct-66212,About this movie,1,16 July 2021,This movie has the same storyline as the first one which was released in the year of 1980. The acting in this film is very poor as well as it is bad acting.,Return to the Blue Lagoon
32,BabyFarkMcGeeZax,A decent film in its own right,4,19 June 2007,"The Good: - Scenery - Soundtrack - CinematographyThe Bad: - Disregards the plot from The Blue Lagoon - Sexual ""overtones"" rather than ""undertones"" - More an attempt at capitalizing on the popularity of the original than an extension of the latter's storyComments:There aren't many situations that manage to capture the imagination as does watching two children blossom into young adults isolated from civilization on a dessert island. The Blue Lagoon's charm was the unadulterated depiction of the purity and innocence of mind that ""civilized"" society deprives us. It was the forgotten image of what children are all doomed to lose as they experience life based on societal dictates rather than the nature we are all born with.Return to the Blue Lagoon re-examines these themes, if under the somewhat greater taint of society's teachings. In this way, the purity of the characters of Return is not as pure, the innocence not as innocent. Although the opening sequence makes quick work of any attachment to the original, Return was a decent film in its own right. Fans of the original will inevitably find it difficult to resist the sequel. The trick will be mentally disregarding it, should it prove more unsettling than fulfilling.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
33,missem9,they. didn't even actually follow the story setup from the first movie. and nobody caught that?,2,2 June 2012,"At the end of the blue lagoon, the first movie made in 1980, when the ship crew find Richard, Emmaline, and paddy, they are asked by Richards father if they were dead, where the crew announces 'NO, NONE OF THEM ARE DEAD. THEY ARE JUST SLEEPING.' And in the beginning of the second movie, return to the blue lagoon in 1991, different people find them and announce them dead in the boat in different positions. When they were found alive and asleep during the first movie. Im sorry, but how did not on critic or viewer notice this? Everyone is talking about how the story line is similar when nobody even noticed that a second movie was near impossible because Richard Emma and paddy were all living at the end of movie 1. I could accept that if they died after the fact from the berries, but to REdiscover them and have them be FOUND dead? Did the director, screenwriter, or any actors even watch the first movie before deciding on this one? It shouldn't even be able to grace being referred to as a sequel. The stories don't even match up.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
34,PsychMajor726,What is with the movie?,2,12 January 2005,"I watched this movie for the first time last year because I loved the first one. What a mistake. I agree with other comments about the plot. I don't understand why they took the parents from the first film, who were alive at the end, and made them dead in this one. I really don't understand why the sailor at the end who tries to rape Lilli looks the same as the one at the beginning who the mother kills by bludgeoning him with a spear rifle. I don't understand why if Brooke Shields, at the age of 16, wasn't allowed to bare her breasts or rear end in the first one, why Milla was allowed to, at 16 also, bare hers in the second film. I could go on and on. There are a few things I enjoy about this film though. I am a major environmentalist and I have often wondered what it would be like to live on a deserted island with only yourself and your lover to depend on for survival. I think it would teach everyone the meaning of life and help all come to grips with reality. There is beautiful photography and music, composed by Basil Poledouris (also the first film's musical composer) of course!",Return to the Blue Lagoon
35,Mattu481,Not too bad,5,31 July 2006,"I didn't think this movie was too bad.I didn't necessarily like that Richard and Em from the first movie wound up being found dead by different people when they were found ""just sleeping"" at the end of the first one by Richard's father. Kinda takes away from the first movie, but I guess it was necessary to set up the angle of their son in the sequel.I think the fact that they were more educated than the couple in the first movie was good, because it gave it it's own element. No one wanted to see a complete repeat of the Blue Lagoon. But the innocence is still there.The fact that they wound up on the same island isn't that far-fetched. They were in the area when they lost their paddle in the first movie. The location they stayed with Paddy as kids in the first movie wasn't THAT far from where they wound up staying after he died. In the second movie, The mother and the kids get dropped off the main boat, so it was probably the closest land there was.And for the people that wondered where the tribe came from when they didn't see them for years, they came every 3 months when it was a full moon outside. That's where the drums were coming from AND the boats going through the water in the middle of the night. They were just never allowed to go to the other side of the island, ITS THE LAW! lol and when they did sneak over there, there was no full moon, so the tribe wasn't there.I liked that they brought in ""civilized"" people towards the end of the movie. It let the viewers see how they'd interact with other people. They always knew that they were supposed to ask to be taken back to civilization if a ship ever came, but if the only interaction they had with ""civilized"" people was being shot at and attempted rape, I'd want to stay on the island too.Overall, it wasn't that bad of a movie. Maybe not as good as the first, but what sequel is? I'd recommend it.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
36,tash_rulz_eva,Fantastic Movie!,8,20 September 2006,"Personally, I love The Blue Lagoon Returns. It is such a beautiful film. I think that this movie shows people that nature and civilization are too completely different ways to live. You can also relate it to, living in the City or The Country. Too different ways to live. Milla does an outstanding performance, as does Brian. They both make the film fresh, in some ways. It is a great movie, and I totally recommend it. It is really natural, and I think that is refreshing. A lot of movies nowadays are about things that you would expect. But you wouldn't have expected a movie like this. Also, the Figi background and land, as you may call it, adds something. I think that the film makers did a splendid job, and I thank them for releasing such a good movie. One of my all time favorite's, would definitely be The Blue Lagoon Returns.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
37,cpoe2,leave expectations at the door and you'll enjoy!!!!,7,10 January 2006,"going into this movie, i didn't have expectations of great acting or a phenomenal script. i had never even heard of it or The Blue Lagoon until a few weeks ago because people only talk about the really great movies.i judge movies on how they make me feel deep down. this wasn't perfect but if you leave all your expectations at the door, you'd be surprised how much truth is there.it lets you enjoy innocence. i think that's why i could even accept the fact that the performances weren't absolutely perfect. children aren't supposed to be perfect, but they do have one thing over most adults, a child of innocence will love unconditionally despite all the confusion that can be found in the world-even on an deserted island. i think the people who created this movie were able to capture that part of life and so i have to approve.i watched The Blue Lagoon before this one and have to say, even though this one is less explicit, it's even more enjoyable. both are worth attention though.however, neither should be viewed by young children; they were given their ratings for a reason.",Return to the Blue Lagoon
