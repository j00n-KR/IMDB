0,SnoopyStyle,good performances from the two leads,7,6 November 2014,Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) is the life of the party with his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson). She dumps him after a misunderstanding. He gets passed-out drunk and Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley) finds him asleep on a lawn during her paper route. He's an irresponsible teen who drinks too much. He finds something compelling about the quiet bookworm nice girl and asks her to the prom. Aimee has never had a boyfriend before and he has daddy issues.This movie is low-key in tone. It allows the two leads to bring out their natural charms. The great thing about it is that the actors fit their characters so easily. The daddy issue isn't the most original and Sutter himself would say that his issues aren't greater than most other kids. I still like the performances.,The Spectacular Now
1,Prismark10,Teenage drunks in the night,5,4 June 2018,"The Spectacular Now is one of these modest, low budget independent films. It has a few star performers making small cameos. A film that has some intelligence but I felt it still pulls it punches. It does not want to go off base and head for a troubled ending.Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) is a cheerful soul, a party loving guy who maybe drinks too much and not exactly heading to graduate out of high school. When he is dumped by his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson) Sutter gets drunk falls asleep on a garden lawn. He is found next morning by Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley) a fellow student. Aimee is nice, clever geeky, awkward, she never had a boyfriend. Sutter is hoping to get back with his ex but she has moved on. So Sutter starts a relationship with the virginal Aimee but Sutter's drinking is getting out of control. He develops further issues when he later meets his alcoholic father who walked out on Sutter when he was a child.A well acted film from its young cast but the ending was trite as it never tackles Sutter's alcoholism.",The Spectacular Now
2,kosmasp,Now and later,8,23 June 2015,"Does it always have to be spectacular now? Can it not be a slow and steady climb to happiness that can be called spectacular? Would that be something that can be considered as a problem and something youth have to get a hold off? The movie may be have romantic tones, but it's about much more than that.It might not be what you were looking for, being pretty obvious on where it wants to go (it's almost funny that Shailene Woodley plays someone who is not being seen as good looking, but her portrayal of a shy teenager is faultless). Family, loss, future and everything gets questioned here. Some things are obvious others aren't. If you like your drama to be thoughtful, you are right here",The Spectacular Now
3,Quinoa1984,The Spectacular Young at Heart,9,17 August 2013,"The Spectacular Now is a coming-of-age drama mixed with young love story about Sutter (Miles Kelly, an interesting, uncynical young find who can communicate a lot of different sides to this character without coming off too fresh or overwrought) who starts off obnoxious (but in the way that is believable to the way that teenage boys can get obnoxious) and in the wake of a failed relationship meets a good, sweet girl, Amy, and a natural relationship unfolds in their senior year of High School. While this is going on, he has a problem with alcohol - which extends to Amy - and about a past history that Sutter has to confront with a dead- beat father. The film that is very well written (based on a book but having that same quality in the dialog and story turns that speaks to their intelligence at navigating conventions) without being show-offy, and performances that feel raw and sensitive and try to avoid a lot of clichés (or that Hollywood way of showing teenagers ""like we think they are"" as opposed to how they are closer to life), and a strong dramatic story about young love and overcoming the flaws in yourself. It's not perfect, and has a few little things with the alcohol element to the film that irked me (which is much bigger than what you may realize seeing the trailer, much more actually, it's really a companion piece with this director's previous movie Smashed which is also about boozing), but its real and honest and that's so rare to find in a teenage story like this. Woodley has a long career ahead of her, and has that great distinction of being naturally pretty, dramatically intuitive, and yet is not SO pretty that you can't accept her as a cute teenager girl (or... dare I say Mary Jane in the next Spiderman movie?) Go see it - it's not top 10 of the year great, but it's great in the ways that matter for a story like this.",The Spectacular Now
4,ComedyFan2010,An interesting take on the teenage years,8,14 May 2018,"Many reviews describe it as a very realistic portrayal of the coming of age. But I didn't really see it to be that realistic. The dialogues and characters seem a bit too mature for the high school years. Most seem to be way more developed and know how to live their lives in a productive way. Yeah, this isn't high school. And the car accident was a tad of unrealistic. After I saw it I thought we see the funeral next. But no the girl seems to have a broken arm and fine afterwards.Still these things are easy to overlook. It is still a nice perspective on the teenage years. I always enjoy the silly teen comedies too, they remind me of the ""good times"", but an more serious movie on the actual pains and doubts we face back then is pretty good too.The thought that one should live in now is actually a very good one. One should. But at the same time one should still leave a bit of attention to the future. This is what our main character learns here. And seeing his struggle is pretty good. I like the scene when he asks his teacher what is so good about being an adult. I remember those thoughts as well. The movie portrays the relationships between charters very well. Aimee who helps Sutter to find himself while he introduces her to more confidence and fun. It is very well shown how their relationship starts to develop. I also like seeing how it is between him and his ex girlfriend Cassidy. She is a good girl too, not some nasty girl exes often are, especially in teen movies. So this was a good part of the movie. And his mother who takes care of him trying to protect him from finding out who his father is. I love the scene where she is convincing him that he is not like his dad. Very touching and believable.All in all a very good movie. Great acting, good story. It makes one reflect on their issues, let one connect to them and understand them.",The Spectacular Now
5,george.schmidt,Echoes of Crowe/Hughes - one of the best teen coming-of-ages dramedies to date.,9,3 August 2013,"THE SPECTACULAR NOW (2013) ***1/2 Miles Teller, Shailene Woodley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kyle Chandler, Brie Larson, Masam Holden, Dayo Okeniyi, Bob Odenkirk, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Wonderful coming-of-age teen dramedy based on Tim Tharp's novel about a happy-go-lucky high school senior (Teller uncannily getting in touch with his inner John Cusack) whose philosophy of the title has him drifting until he meets a sweet girl in his graduating class (Woodley in easily the breeziest performance of a teenager ever) who anchors him in all the right ways, including love. Smart/funny screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber works incredibly well with James Ponsoldt's straight-forward clear-eyed direction with echoes of Cameron Crowe and John Hughes, involving all the pitfalls of adolescence and heartbreak along the path of adulthood. Seek this indie gem out!",The Spectacular Now
6,evanston_dad,"Days of Wine and Roses, Young Adult Style",7,20 September 2013,"An angst-filled coming-of-age film that rises a bit above the average movie in the genre, and which is given an extra jolt of originality by having at its center a character type not given much attention by the movies -- a teenage alcoholic.I was really with the movie for its first half. Its rhythms and the performances of its young actors felt natural and authentic. These young people don't fit into instantly recognizable categories. The male hot shot walks with a swagger and acts like the king of his social circles but is secretly crippled by a sense of inadequacy and a yearning for his out-of-the-picture dad. The young girl who emerges as his unlikely love interest is not the wall flower of a John Hughes movie. She's a bit nerdy, yes, but she's not tormented by her nerdiness and doesn't feel the need to justify it. They go on a road trip to visit the hot shot's delinquent dad, and the crushing sense of disappointment this visit creates is more than their relationship can bear.The film's later half began to feel a bit ponderous and heavy-handed for my taste. I appreciated the film's eagerness to treat kids on the cusp of adulthood as vivid characters worthy of our interest and sympathy rather than as bitter sophisticates already more mature than their parents, as they are so often portrayed in other movies. But the film does sink slightly under its own ambitions.But still, easily worth a watch and very similar in both tone and quality to last year's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" and much more genuine than that film.Grade: B+",The Spectacular Now
7,ferguson-6,A rare worthy entry into teen Dramedy genre,8,15 August 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Coming-of-age teen dramas with a comedic flair that speak to that tumultuous period of life are rarely worthy of discussion. The exceptions hover film greatness: Rebel Without a Cause, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Dazed and Confused, The Breakfast Club, and Say Anything ... Along comes young director James Ponsoldt and his adaptation of Tim Tharp's novel. While not perfect and falling just short of the level of those classics, it is nonetheless a welcome addition and quite interesting.It's tempting to call Sutter (played by up-and-comer Miles Teller) a happy-go-lucky kid. He's the frat boy type - quick with a quip, smooth with the parents and girls, and the envy of the masses. That term would be misapplied to a kid who not only is never without his flask, but also gives them as gifts. He uses his wit and booze to dull the pain of his aimless existence. We see his lackadaisical efforts at completing a college admission form, and it's used as a plot device to track Sutter's progression through the film.Brie Larson is terrific as Sutter's perfect match ... right up until she decides that his philosophy of living in the now (even spectacularly) doesn't leave hope for much of a future. After an extreme night of drinking and partying, Sutter gets awakened while laying in a neighbor's front yard. Shailene Woodley (The Descendants) is Aimee Finicky who recognizes the popular Sutter, even though he has no idea who she is. Slowly, the two connect on a level previously unknown to either ... some good, some not so wise (just like real teenagers).This couple of opposites learn much from each other, and soon enough, Sutter is confronting his long last father (Kyle Chandler). No real surprises what he discovers, but it's a life lesson that must be learned. Sutter seeks more from his remaining family - a big sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who escaped the grind, and a workaholic mom (Jennifer Jason Leigh) doing her best to provide hope for Sutter.The script is co-written by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber who also wrote (500) Days of Summer. John Hughes and Cameron Crowe proved they could present teen dilemmas in an entertaining way, and this one follows the same structure. This is a dialogue-heavy story as Sutter and Aimee struggle alone and together to figure out life's next steps.I will say that for the first few minutes of the movie, I found Sutter to be the kind of guy that I would typically have no interest in. Tip of the cap to the filmmakers and Miles Teller for turning that around. It should also be noted that Shailene Woodley is so naturally affecting, that her character never comes across as anything but sincere. Given the state of today's mainstream coming of age stories, this one definitely deserves a look and could gather some attention come awards time.",The Spectacular Now
8,siderite,Finally a good teen movie,8,6 January 2014,"I wanted to see this film to soothe my wife. She usually loves adolescent romance stuff, so I thought I would suffer through it. Instead, I ended up liking it more than she did.The thing about romance films and adolescence films in particular is that the kids are presented like complete idiots, like aliens from the planet Dumb. In order to keep up with this superficial image all other characters must act the same. The result is a complete fake.The Spectacular Now is nothing like that. From the start it portrays teens as complex, intelligent, troubled about their past and their future, maybe laid back alcoholics or chronically shy or overachievers with low self esteem. And they all interact like human beings. It's a joy to see a film like this.I also loved that they didn't use the cheap tricks of romance movies in general. No evil adversary to define the character as good, no ultimate goal to direct the entire film from point A to point B, no artificial accidents or catastrophes to move people out of their stupor, no highschool cliques, no Facebook or Twitter dramas. Instead, normal people doing normal stuff, trying to get over themselves and have a happy life.The film was not without its flaws. It was a little too slow, for once. It only lasted an hour and a half but it felt like more. Also there is a somewhat seamless jump of a few years that takes the viewer by surprise (I still don't know when it happened). Also, I am a bit grumpy today, the film probably deserved a 9. Go watch it!",The Spectacular Now
9,jdesando,Yes it is!,10,16 September 2013,"""Life is a series of moments called now."" Sutter (Miles Teller)It's rare to find a late-teen coming of age film classy and understated like The Spectacular Now. Sutter (a spectacular Teller), fast upon high school graduation, has invested his bonhomie and energy into ""now"" at the expense of the ""future"" (read ""planning""). Director James Ponsoldt has woven this motif throughout in one of the year's artfully smartest yet most accessible indies.Almost all Sutter's concentration is on making others feel loved by him but not understanding he must grow up with them or they will leave him as a rival says, a ""joker."" His growing love for plain Aimee (Shailene Woodley) reveals his slow maturing into an adult who can go beyond superficial charm and beauty, traits of his romance with Cassidy ( Brie Larson—look for her terrific performance in Short Term 12) although what she wants for him reveals her depth and highlights his immaturity.We love this guy because he is sincerely but charmingly lost, as many of us were at his age and still are. He is best characterized as a searcher in his love of alcohol and his estranged father, Tommy (Kyle Chandler). For the former, the omnipresent flask serves as warning of his irresponsibility. Alcohol is his friend until he sees it is not. Dad is another caution revealing that Sutter could end up an alcoholic and lost to himself. I could have done with a much reduced segment with dad. I get the idea, already, about similarity to absent dad. But I have to love this kid: Even losing a job highlights his essential honesty because he can't guarantee his employer that he could stop drinking in order to keep his job.I am moved by the quiet humanity of The Spectacular Now that so deftly plays the present against the future with actors unusually talented enough to underplay their types and themes universal enough to make the journey back to teen trials a rewarding cinematic one.",The Spectacular Now
10,StevePulaski,An exercise in emotion and character - the best kind of exercise,9,1 September 2013,"The Spectacular Now is a deep exercise in emotion and character, and a bold step in the right direction for teen films, which are becoming decidedly more naturalistic, involved, and human. Last year, we had the wonderful Perks of Being a Wallflower, and not two months ago we had the strong and touching The Way, Way Back. Now we are graced with such a wonderful look at a teenage relationship plagued by fear, alcohol, understanding, nervousness, and uncertainty that it almost hurts.Miles Teller will be a recognizable face for some. He appeared in a faceless role in 21 & Over this year, which I regarded as tasteless comedy that was so heavily focused on partying and excessive raunchiness that it became almost as nihilistic as Project X. Here, he is the same character but given a personality and a believable, realistic touch. Teller plays Sutter Keely, a high school senior obsessed with living in the moment. He parties hard, drinks constantly, anything from keg-beer to hard liquor concealed in a flask, works in men's clothing, and discards the future as something that will just happen. He is woken up on the lawn of someone's home by Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley), a pleasantly average girl who is up early at 6am getting ready to do her mother's paper route. Aimee's mother has been controlling her for a long time, even potentially corrupting her college ambition because her idea of ""living in the now"" is paying bills and keeping the home straight.Sutter and Aimee strike an immediate friendship. He introduces her to the luxury and openness of partying and drinking. She introduces him to the wonderful and eclectic world of Manga. The film beautifully illustrates how both parties were welcomed into a different little world they would've never experienced if it wasn't for the other person - and Sutter's alcoholic tendencies.But overtime, Sutter's alcoholism worsens. He clearly drinks to get drunk, but remains functional when doing it. He starts to shun his relationship with Aimee, being fully aware he is bad news and not the guy she needs. She has long accepted his drinking habits because she can see the person he is at the core - caring, harmless, and immensely loving. Meanwhile, his ex-girlfriend comes in the picture every now and then. Her name is Cassidy (Brie Larson) and - rather than being a typical queen bee or spiteful ex-girlfriend - it's evident she ended their relationship based on the frustrating inertness Sutter posses. He doesn't have a plan and the only thing he can do when you ask him about it is take a sip out of his personalized flask. There's no future there.Teller and Woodley have impeccable chemistry here. Woodley, once more, refines her role as the supporting girl with natural beauty in more ways than one like she did in Alexander Payne's The Descendants. They are only guided by the smooth, sensitive direction of James Ponsoldt, whose last film, simply titled Smashed, took a look at a young, first grade schoolteacher who was beginning to fall prey to alcoholism. Her addiction became so brutal, she lies and says her incident of throwing up in class is related to her untrue pregnancy and not a piercing hangover from the night before. The film showed how one's addiction to the bottle can compromise their life. Ponsoldt's follow-up effort is more about showing how the bottle (or flask in this case) can compromise a perfectly beautiful friendship.Writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber make this a surprising tone piece, one that is more concerned with the loquacious behavior of teens rather than the raunchy behavior. A tremendous scene focuses on Sutter and Aimee walking away from a keg-party on the beach, deep into the woods, talking about their homelife and their favorite things in life. The scene is a four-to-five minute static shot and develops character nonchalantly and not forcefully, allowing for the naturalism to just sneak up on the audience. This isn't the only scene with Sutter and Aimee that tackle beautiful touching and realistic instances. Take for example the scene where they go to have sex. ""Take your shirt off"" she innocently says, and after he does - successfully exposing an ordinary male body - she follows, exposing another ordinary body and a white bra. When he giggles, just because of the circumstances, she tenderly covers up her bare midriff with her arms, to which he responds by lightly removing them from her stomach. They proceed to have sex in a blissfully unpredictable manner, deeply fixated on the bodies and the intimacy - not the nudity. This is another bold instance that will resonate and be remembered by teens more-so than the average sex scene in comedies, where breasts and hilarity are the only thing that matters.The Spectacular Now's one minor missteps results when it gets too caught up with Sutter's story of being raised by a single mother who closets information on his father that it kind of forgets that Aimee is a major character here as well. We know Aimee's mom is controlling because she says so, but never do we see Aimee stand up to her or take action to her mother's dictative qualities. Equal humanization would've been divine seeing that humanization alone is one of the film's major goals.The film concludes on yet another bold note, cementing that Neustadter and Weber didn't want to say too much. Much of the film operates on deep, character emotion, so attaching an ending that neatly packages things up would've been a complete contradiction to the film's focus. I initially thought some would be upset with the film's ending, saying it cheats the audiences, but if they were brave enough to seek out a smaller film of this magnitude, they shouldn't be disgruntled that it plays different instruments than other films of the same genre.",The Spectacular Now
11,blanbrn,Good coming of age drama that blends life and love while living in the now.,7,11 May 2017,"Many of us have seen those sweet teen dramas that involve love and stories of going to the prom and having sex for the first time, and with this movie ""The Spectacular Now"" it blends a little bit of it all!

12,Hellmant,Unabashedly honest look at teen life and alcoholism!,10,4 October 2013,"'THE SPECTACULAR NOW': Five Stars (Out of Five)One of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year is this teen drama coming-of-age film centering on young love, wanting to live in the moment (and not wanting to grow up) and alcoholism. It's about an alcoholic high school senior who just had his heart broken, by his longtime girlfriend, and is now influencing a 'good girl' from school, who adores him, into alcoholism. The director (James Ponsoldt) last directed the critically acclaimed 2012 comedy-drama 'SMASHED', which is about an alcoholic couple who runs into marriage problems when one of them sobers up. So the director obviously likes films that deal with excessive drinking. This film was written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (the duo also wrote the popular 2009 young love film '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER') and it's based on the book of the same name by Tim Tharp. I found the film to be moving and disturbing (due to it's unabashedly honest look at teen life and alcoholism).Miles Teller (who also played a young partier in the teen comedy films '21 & OVER' and 'PROJECT X') stars as Sutter Keely, a high school senior who is more than content 'just living in the now' and not making plans for the future. This (along with his constant drinking) drove his girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson), crazy and she dumped him. Sutter and Cassidy had gone out for a long time and were always the life of the party wherever they went, Sutter thinks, so he's extremely heartbroken by the breakup. He tries to rebound with a 'nice girl' from school named Aimee Finecky (up and coming star Shailene Woodley) who finds him passed out one morning on a stranger's lawn. Aimee is immediately infatuated with him and totally caught up in the idea of a possible romance with this cool and charming guy. Sutter isn't looking for anything serious though; he's still obsessed with getting back together with Cassidy (who has a boyfriend now as well). Sutter introduces Aimee to drinking (with his flask of whiskey he's always drinking out of) and eventually turns her into a budding alcoholic like him. The two do find encouragement in each other as well though as both helps each other deal with family issues. For Sutter it's about reconnecting with his father (Kyle Chandler), who left his family long ago (and Sutter never fully knew why).The film is labeled a comedy-drama but I didn't really find it that funny. Sutter is constantly cracking jokes but he's like a real person in that way and not nearly as funny as he thinks he is. Teller is great in the role. Woodley (who's being hyped as possibly 'the next Jennifer Lawrence') is adorable and so likable in her role but her obsessive love for Sutter is disturbing (the way he abuses her and she constantly, immediately, forgives him). This kind of unconditional love blows my mind and is definitely not healthy (the two actors reteam next year in the highly anticipated youth book adaptation action film 'DIVERGENT'). I'm kind of a weekend alcoholic so the subject matter is definitely very interesting and involving for me but I'd like to see a movie that focuses on a 'two day a week binge drinker', rather than the full blown alcoholic (that is constantly drinking) which only ever seems to be developed in films. Still the movie was very touching and moving for me. It's dark but also upbeat (the way all good films should be). It's beautifully directed, and shot (the cinematography is breathtaking), and of course the screenplay is brilliant. The critics definitely got this one right, it's a teen movie not to be missed. It's one of the last movies Roger Ebert ever reviewed, before he died, and he gave it a perfect rating (so did Richard Roeper, calling it ""the best American movie of the year so far"").Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZa4L9FExKY",The Spectacular Now
13,thesar-2,"Now, I Get It",8,22 January 2014,"But, it took to the final few frames.The Spectacular Now certainly wanted to be more than it was. While interesting, well paced, well made, well acted and kept the viewer going, it was uneven at spots, unsure of itself and took way too long to teach the lesson it wanted you to know.I always love Miles Teller. He has this confidence and modesty, this humor and humble attitude with each role he takes on. He's high up and yet grounded, he's the coolest kid and still relatable. Some might see that he's the same in every role, but I disagree to a degree. He does have a bit of range and I think he'll only extend those lines with his future.Here, he plays a sexually active, hard-drinking and laid way back high schooler who gets dumped by someone he fancied more than most girls and rebounds instantly with a less popular, more down to earth, but gorgeous inside young lady.Tellet plays Sutter, someone who struggles but doesn't know why. He's confident, yet wonders how he is. He moves forward but feels stuck. Aimee, his new girlfriend, has many layers and is someone we should all know. And yet, Sutter might be plotting something, he might be messing with her, using her or he might actually need her.While the movie has the indie feel, the urge to give us what we always watch these low-key high school romances for, it felt more real and true than a lot of the same genre I've witnessed. And while I struggled to get the ""higher meaning"" and WOW moment throughout, it wasn't until the final couple of shots that tied it all in for me and held my smile through the credits.Give it a shot, watch it through and smile like me. It is an interesting and deeper movie than it appears on the surface* * * Final thoughts: But..Fair warning. I've seen more drunk driving in this movie than on a full season of Cops. This is hardly ever explored or looked down upon in this movie. Honestly, I cannot believe how this is not condemned nor shown the true consequence of this needless and selfish act. If one can remember how horrible this deed is and not let these lucky characters get away without so much a scratch, i.e. understand this is fiction without real consequences, you should be able to still enjoy the film.",The Spectacular Now
14,ThomasDrufke,Not Too Late For Me,10,26 May 2015,"The Spectacular Now is one of those films that grows on you the more you think about it. It's an acquired taste because of the deep themes and depressing overtone. But if you watch it a few times I think you appreciate the characters and what the filmmaker was going for. James Ponsoldt, a new acclaimed director, shoots for a coming of age meets a romantic drama. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley both give it a tremendous amount of realism. High School films are hard to pull off, when they hit, they really hit.Teller plays Sutter, an alcoholic senior who ends up drunk on Aimee's, played by Woodley, lawn. It's another meet by chance romance, but not like you would think. They go to the same school but she only knows of him. It's a nice twist on the Say Anything storyline. But what makes the film special is that the romance makes sense. Aimee has never had a boyfriend but wants to be loved. Sutter, doesn't believe anyone really likes him, and is therefore afraid to get too close with people. He also initially pursues Aimee to make his ex girlfriend jealous, but he learns the hard way. I love the romances that succeed in changing both sides philosophies on life, which is clear in their scene after the party. They both help each other further their goals and aspirations, or in Sutter's case, create life goals. The film also approaches sex in a realistic high school way. It's often portrayed as an incredible experience without flaws, but it feels grounded here. Ponsoldt gave us probably the most realistic high school pic to this day.I think it helps that the writers also wrote (500) Days of Summer, so they have experience in writing beautiful chemistry. Because Teller and Woodley really do knock it out the park together. The third act takes a pretty dramatic turn but it never shifted tones. The drama was always an undertone to an otherwise pretty sweet film. Much like 500 Days, it's a bittersweet film but I tend to look at it as a feel good romance. But it's not a feel good romance with Hollywood clichés. In fact, I was trying to find flaws while re-watching and I couldn't really find any. It's just that effective of a movie. I hope Teller and Woodley continue to make quality movies together, and I mean after that Detergent quadrilogy ends.+Perfect chemistry +Beautifully written +Treats situations like they actually are +No clichés +Relatable 10/10",The Spectacular Now
15,g-bodyl,Reality Bites!,9,13 November 2014,"The Spectacular Now is yet another one of those teen-based films that have been the rage lately. However, this one takes a grounded approach and as a result, the film is able to hit home more often than not. The performances are so raw and natural, you feel like you came straight out of a high school yearbook. I can really dig this indie approach because of its honest realism. This film is sweet, but it's also tough. The central theme is about how anybody can fall in love with each other, no matter the clique.James Ponsoldt's film is about a high school senior named Sutter whose girlfriend just left him, has no career ambitions, and is an alcoholic. He forms an unlikely friendship with this girl named Aimee who happens to be an avid reader of manga and is not one of those teenage drama queens Sutter's kind usually associate with.The acting is fantastic. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are rising stars and both give spot-on performances. They have excellent chemistry between each other and they give us a reason to care about their characters. Brie Larson gives a great performance as Sutter's ex-girlfriend.Overall, The Spectacular Now is an excellent, coming-of-age film that finds success by taking the grounded route. If one did not know better, this is the kind of film one could use to describe their high school years. It brought back certain memories of my own. This film does an excellent job on making a worn-out genre fresh again. I rate this film 9/10.",The Spectacular Now
16,lesleyharris30,"A Well Performed, Subtle Drama,",8,3 September 2017,"The Spectacular Now is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a talented cast. It is a very nice, subtle drama that follows a recently graduated young man named Sutter. The characters lifestyle and free loathing personality is conveyed really well, which goes on to showcase tonal changes well as he gets involved with Aimee, a shy, self cautious girl who has experienced far less than him. Watching this imperfect relationship blossom is beautiful, there interactions are relatable and human. I did find that there was a massive lack of character development for anyone other than Sutter and Aimee. I completely understand that they are the main characters, so of course they would be given the most scope, but everyone else is quite two dimensional and their scenes only serve as plot development.Miles Teller and Shallene Woodley both deliver tremendous performances. Both characters change from being with each other, as any couple would, as we see the slow alterations of their personality as the plot progresses very well thanks to two young performers who manage to make their work appear effortless. Slow moving drama that is a pleasure from beginning to end. A stellar script and a cast that do it justice, I would recommend The Spectacular Now to anyone looking for a good drama. Sutter, a popular party boy, meets introvert Aimee, and a romance soon blossoms between them. Best Performance: Miles Teller",The Spectacular Now
17,A_Different_Drummer,"No, not merely a great ""teen"" movie....",9,20 February 2014,"... but one of the best movies ever. EVER! I actually (being picky here) wanted to give this film a 9.5 but the IMDb does not do halfsies. I confess, missed this on first release, found it on a list of ""best teen movies"" and dove in. Wow. In case I was not clear. Wow. The confusing part, the part that makes it one small sliver less than perfect, is the first hour. It is bold and courageous on the part of the director to spend so much time setting up the characters for the climax, and the transition point, the specific point WHERE YOU REALIZE YOU ARE IN FACT NOT WATCHING MERELY JUST ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE, arrives precisely 1:14 in the film where there is a ""car accident"" scene so perfectly captured on film that I jumped out of my chair ... and I was not sitting in a chair at the time. (Last time a scene affected me physically so much was the original, first-run, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD ... but I digress). The idea of setting up a protagonist who becomes ""self-aware"" at the end of the story is not new, but I have seen a lot of films (and reviewed many right here) and I simply cannot remember it ever being done so darned well, so engagingly, so hypnotically. A lot of it is the casting. I also cannot easily recall a film where the director put so much care, so much love, into the casting. It is an indie film with better casting for even the lesser roles than many Hollywood epics. Everyone you meet in this film feels real and authentic. Not a sour note anywhere. Which brings us to Shailene Woodley. Words fail me. I can tell you how she got the part. That's easy. Her face is geometrically just slightly off center, and the key to beauty in our age is symmetry. And the part of Amy is about a girl who is inwardly beautiful but not necessarily outwardly so. That's how she GOT the role. How she made the film her own,however, how she garnered so many awards, all DESERVED, is by delivering a portrayal that is as perfect and as memorable as any you have ever seen in movies. She is nothing less than astonishing. She steals the film. She hotwires it and rides off into the sunset. She ""glows"" inwardly, like Rachel McAdams, no easy feat. It is no coincidence that the director chose to end the picture with a freeze of her face in a reaction shot. He knew what he had, and he knew how to use it. All in all of the best films I have seen, and one of the most memorable. Highly recommended.",The Spectacular Now

The two strike up a relationship with Aimee fully invested and Sutter still being Sutter. This is easily one of the best releases of the year. It's so refreshing to see younger actors actually act in a movie that means something rather then this weeks vampire love story. Miles Teller does such a great job in this movie that I think for him not to be nominated for anything is a crime. This is a movie that I can just not say enough about.

19,callanvass,"""The Real Hardship Is Me""",8,2 November 2014,"Sutter (Miles Teller) is a charming senior that lives life to the fullest! The only problem is that his constant partying gets him into trouble. His life begins to go into a downward spiral when Cassidy (Brie Larson) breaks up with him. To make matters worse, Sutter is a budding alcoholic! Things start to slowly turn around when he meets Aimee (Woodley)Very good to know that Hollywood is still capable of coming up with genuine coming of age films. There are many believable issues in this movie, and I thought it rang true. There are many people in the world that suffer from parenting issues. Your parents can figure into how you grow as a person. You make your own choices, but parenting is big reason. This movie provides an interesting insight into this subject, and I was very engrossed in it. Sutter's believable plight is what makes this movie! More on Miles Teller shortly. It didn't take me long to realize I was gonna like this movie. Because it's so genuine, it makes all the situations that more empathetic. There are a couple of poignant scenes that hit me hard. When Sutter visits his absentee Father after many years of not seeing him, it became very uncomfortable for me. Kyle Chandler plays the despicable absentee father part to a T. I hated him very much. It also brings up iffy subjects like alcoholism in very realistic and heartbreaking fashion. This is Miles Teller's breakout performance. His multi-layered performance moved me. His performance didn't get as much attention as it should have! Credit to Miles Teller for making Sutter such a lovable character. I didn't always agree with what he did. As a matter of fact, there were a couple of times he disgusted me with his actions. He always managed to win me back, and that's a sign of sheer talent. This kid is gonna be huge! Speaking of being huge...Woodley never fails to impress me with her talents. You'll fall in love with Aimee! She's the dream girl you've always pictured in your mind! She's it. She's real! Her relationship with Miles Teller is a main reason this movie works so well. Jennifer Jason Leigh's part as the Mother isn't as developed as I'd have liked, but she was solid as usual. The ending was very well done. It's somewhat conventional, but just ambiguous enough to make you wonder. It gives you just enough happiness & enough doubt to keep you wondering about what is gonna happen. This movie is fairly depressing at times, but very much worth it. This one is a diamond in the rough! It's somewhat neglected, and it shouldn't be! This movie taught me to always move forward. You gonna live in the now? Or the past?

I have gone through this; is it deja vu?Then it may hit you something like 'The Perks of Being A Wallflower (2012),' but the plot heavily deviates in all senses, except the base. Nah. The story is something that every adolescent can relate to her/himself in some way or the other. The alcoholism, the love confusion, the family bonds, parents' divorce or even death: everything's sampled. But they don't touch cliché anywhere. Fantastic romance in the first half, heavy drama in the second. Even the sex scenes are so serene.It chiefly talks about how the life of a carefree guy turns around when he realizes what he's been doing to the people who care for him and are close to him. He explores out of his comfort zone and finds the hard way that life is about ""now."" A beautifully written story which is not dull at all. The deep conversations convey the message. Characters played by skillful actors give out a pleasant look. The photography is good, so is the background score. Very good direction and screenplay, the latter of which helps/gives an immense outlook towards the end.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!

Yes, it was a romantic tale set in a similar fashion along with a subplot like family issues resolved in a meaningful story. An incredible cast, especially the combination of lead two worked awesomely. These two rising stars showed their worth by giving wonderful performances.The movie portrays an unexpected relationship between a charming, popular, but a careless high school boy and an intelligent girl geek. They are totally opposite in character, but shares similar family difficulties and that makes them to hang out. As the times goes on, the relationship thickens with a strong connection. The school nears the end and the future plans are what stands between them tearing apart. How they react to it and what should be done is what brings the movie's conclusion.This novel based movie was at its best. A teenager movie that can work even for the adults. A boy who lives in ordinary 'nows' and a girl who plan for a spectacular 'future', together it became a 'spectacular now'. A teen movie with a new perspective and filled with the respectable contents. You can't get a better movie than this where most of similar themes are poured with unbearable commercial elements. This movie deserves a sequel, at least that is what I thought and want.",The Spectacular Now
23,Floated2,Not the typical teen drama,8,25 July 2017,"The Spectaculor Now is a teen drama book adaptation film. As with many books, this film was apparently a smaller scale novel compared to other teen or younger adult types. For a teen drama/comedy type, as seen in past years, this film is quite more mature and more serious and doesn't rely on silly gags or over the top jokes. There are some comic relief scenes and the tone isn't too serious but at other parts, the film takes quite a turn and becomes more serious and focused. The Spectaculor Now is well cast, with Miles Teller in the lead and Shailene Woodley supporting. Though it was somewhat hard to take them both as high school students (18/17 years old) considering how their careers are now. Also with the character constantly drinking, having a nice car, and working part time. As well as Shailene Woodley playing an outcast and people being surprised that Miles Teller's character is interested in her. Miles Teller reminded of Shia Laboeuf in his earlier days at certain parts. Unlike many teen drama's, many of them are filled with predictable and over the top love romance, where as this film is more sensitive and feels quite more authentic. The film somewhat went downhill with a subplot involving Sutter wanting to find more information about his father, resulting in him personally visiting him, then of course things don't go as planned. The ending was also quite different than Hollywood's typical romance teen drama's, and which is why this film elevates itself. Overall, this film was something different, and it is a shame it did not do too well at the box office, though it did not have a large budget, being a smaller scale independent film. If you are expecting another 'The Notebook' or 'The Fault in Our Stars, you may be disappointed.",The Spectacular Now
24,eddie_baggins,This is a love story as true and real as you'd hope to see,8,1 June 2014,"Layered, gritty yet in equal measure funny and featuring a star making turn from its male lead Miles Teller (it's not hard to see why he was cast in the Fantastic 4 reboot), James Ponsoldt's examination of teen love and entering into the world of adulthood is an often stunning piece of work that is rightfully regarded as one of last year's best and a festival darling the world over.The Spectacular Now, safe to say, is a highly original and heartfelt tale that will take the viewer to places that are unexpected and all the more affecting because of it. Anchoring Ponsoldt's film is Miles Teller as the seemingly always drinking and always comical Sutter, a popular and well known member of the school community whose care-free attitude marks a deeper and more personal issue regarding his family and upbringing. Teller without question is this films heart and soul, giving a performance so well acted that you sense in the right marketplace awards could've been coming his way. Sutter is a fantastically well written character and one you grow to care for even when wrong decisions are made and by the films last act there are some truly heartbreaking and raw scenes that will leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Teller is well supported by rising star Shailene Woodley as love interest Aimee but really the other star of the film is the behind the scenes work.Written by 500 Days of Summer writing duo Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, The Spectacular Now in many respects shares similarities to their 2009 hit but has more focus on the less whimsical aspects of love and instead has more of life's harsher moments. With a script that is consistent in either being razor sharp funny or soul piercingly real there are too many scenes to pick from in talking up the joys of the films screenplay but the opening monologue, or a later scene with Sutter and his boss Dan played by Bob Odenkirk (nice to see Saul from Breaking Bad once more), are particular highlights with Ponsoldt's keen direction another major plus for the film after his great film Smashed showed so much promise previously.If you're looking for a typical teen romance/coming of age type film The Spectacular Now will not satisfy your needs, but if you're seeking a film that walks the line almost perfectly between romantic comedy and heartbreaking family drama this is the film for you.

25,howard.schumann,Sensitive and realistic,9,26 August 2013,"Sutter is brash. Sutter is funny. Sutter has charisma. Sutter comes from a nice home and has a part-time job. Sutter is popular. Oh, yes. Sutter also drinks too much. Based on a novel by Tim Tharp and written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber ((500) Days of Summer), James Ponsoldt's The Spectacular Now takes us on a journey through Sutter Keely's (Miles Teller) minefields of adolescence with little support along the way. The casualty of a damaged relationship with his father who left home when he was a child, Sutter seems bent on making bad choices about his future. Though he declares his philosophy to be to ""live in the moment,"" but, for all intents and purposes, he is so tied to the past that he cannot fully be in this moment or any other.He is close to graduating but is baffled by Geometry and is told point blank by his teacher Mr. Aster (Andre Royo) that he does not want to fail him but that he needs to get his life together, a suggestion that the boy receives with a clueless grin. A party animal zeroing in on high school graduation but without a semblance of a plan for what comes next, he walks around school carrying a flask, mixing booze with any other non-alcoholic drink he happens to have in his hand. When his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson) breaks up with him, he turns to a night of binge drinking that ends with him waking up on the front lawn of an unfamiliar house with a girl standing over him.The girl, Aimee Finicky (Shailene Woodley, George Clooney's snarky daughter in The Descendants), is just about to deliver papers on her mother's paper route and invites Sutter to come along. On their delivery route the shy Aimee who is a devotee of science fiction mangas, says she has never had a boyfriend and willingly accepts Sutter's invitation to go to a party and to tutor him in Geometry. Their relationship is sweet and both enjoy each other's company but without any agenda of conquest. Aimee's friends, however, warn her about Sutter's proclivity with the bottle but she prefers to ignore them. It is not long, however, before Sutter has Aimee drinking with him to bolster her shaky self image.He gives her a gift of a personalized flask before their prom and confides to her that his father gave him beer when he was only six. He tells her that drinking will help her stand up to her mother on the issue of going to college in Philadelphia. She tells him, however, that she is willing to confront her mother on college but only if he will also demand that his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) tell him where his father is so he can visit him. Both fulfill their side of the bargain but, when they go together to meet Sutter's father (Kyle Chandler), the film takes on a darker hue and the issues become sadly crystallized.While there are some unnecessary melodramatic moments, The Spectacular Now is a smart, generally restrained and honest film that handles the subject of teen alcoholism, relationships, and sex in a sensitive and realistic way. It is not a film about alcoholism but about self awareness, portraying teenagers who talk and act as if they were real people and treating them with dignity and respect.While it has a strong ensemble cast that includes Bob Odenkirk as Sutter's boss, Andre Royo as his math teacher, Masam Holden as his friend Ricky, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Sutter's sister Holly, it is Teller and Woodley, recipients of the Jury Prize for acting at Sundance, who carry the film. They allow us not only to care about their struggles but also to reflect on our own challenge to be fully present to each moment and to the people around us, to live as Buddhist teacher Ippen put it as if, ""every moment is the last moment and every moment is a rebirth.""",The Spectacular Now
26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A maturely told coming-of-age story with a surprisingly authentic feel,8,23 January 2014,"""The Spectacular Now,"" based on the novel by Tim Tharp, does us the unusual favor of depicting teenage relationships without any romanticism or moral agendas. It's a little surprising that it was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, writers of ""(500) Days of Summer,"" because that film definitely exaggerated its core romantic relationship, but what these films have in common is their avoidance of fairy tale endings.I won't spoil the end of ""Spectacular Now,"" but it's indicative of the rest of the film: open- ended, morally ambiguous and full of raw, human connection. Sutter (Miles Teller) is a party boy senior in high school fresh out of his best relationship yet with a girl named Cassidy (Brie Larson). Incapable of being alone, when he encounters Aimee (Shailene Woodley), a girl in his class he never knew existed, he sees her as a project of sorts and convinces her to tutor him in geometry in order to spend more time with her. Eventually, of course, he becomes smitten.Sutter's intentions are a little vague, so at times it's painful to watch Aimee, the shy, quietly beautiful bookworm, fall under his spell, but the reality of high school relationships is thus. It's difficult because most people who watch the film have been there and made these mistakes, but that's part of the authenticity of the story. The bigger elephant in the movie is Sutter's alcoholism. It's rampant in the film, but goes almost entirely unaddressed. Aimee accepts Sutter's drinking habits and encourages them time to time as well. This is hard to understand and accept as a viewer, but speaks volumes to the film's attitude on the whole. The entire film we wait and wait for some kind of underage drinking accident or for drinking to become part of the conflict, but it doesn't. The story doesn't want to preach; the drinking is part of Sutter's character and tells us about what's going on with him on the inside. Director James Ponsoldt communicates this quite well, no doubt aided by his experience directing the 2012 Sundance hit ""Smashed,"" about a relationship between alcoholics.Ponsoldt makes much of ""The Spectacular Now"" feel natural. Scenes between Teller and Woodley have such a relaxed, true-to-life feel. Regardless of whether their dialogue veered from the script or not, their comfort on screen and with one another is evidence of Ponsoldt's ability to work with talent. ""The Spectacular Now"" has the look of a typical coming-of-age film, but something about the script and Ponsoldt's direction makes it feel extremely atypical. In terms of the story and screenplay, it's the way the adult characters interact with the young people. The traditional roles parents (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kyle Chandler play Sutter's divorced parents) play in the lives of teenage main characters doesn't subscribe to the same, often melodramatic dynamic present in coming-of-age indies. But while Ponsoldt, Neustadter and Weber have treated Tharp's story with a heavy dose of maturity, it doesn't mean the behaviors of all the characters reflect the same maturity. In fact, it's the lack of maturity in a lot of cases that makes the film so honest. It's troubling for us to watch the bad things that we expect to happen unfold on screen, like the indie coming-of- age equivalent of the horror movie character who opens that stupid door, but it can be liberating to let go of the concept that filmmakers should be moral arbiters of the story they're telling. It's like parents who let their children learn the hard way.Living in the moment is a message most people get when they walk away from a coming-of- age film, but ""The Spectacular Now"" treats that as square one. Sutter is all about living in the moment, he has the whole ""live while you're young"" thing figured out, and the movie tells a story that complicates our understanding of what it means to live in the present.~Steven CThanks for reading!

27,Turfseer,"Solid, coming of age tale of troubled teenager derails slightly with abrupt happy ending",6,26 January 2014,"'The Spectacular Now' is directed by James Ponsoldt, who gave us last year's alcohol-themed drama, 'Smashed'. This film is also partly about alcoholism but overall it's a coming of age story, focusing on the trials and tribulations of one Sutter Kelly (played by an engaging Miles Teller). Sutter is an 18 year old well-liked and outgoing high school student, who appears not to have any problems aggressively pursuing women. His very good-looking girlfriend, Cassidy, eventually decides to leave him because Sutter is fast developing a rather nasty drinking problem and has no real ambitions, except living in the 'spectacular now'. One night Sutter gets drunk and ends up on a stranger's lawn. He's awakened by Cassidy's opposite, the semi-shy 'good girl', Aimee Finecky (played by Shailene Woodley of 'The Descendants' fame'). In the first half of 'The Spectacular Now', we're led to believe that the film is going to be about Sutter's conflict over the two girls, but soon that doesn't turn out to be the case. Sutter and Aimee both challenge each other to stand up to their mothers. In Aimee's case, she wants to go to college in Philadelphia but her mother wants her to remain home, helping her with her paper route job. Sutter wants his mother to give him his long-lost father's phone number, so he can get in touch with him (for years the Mom has refused to comply).The second half of the film's narrative veers in a decidedly different direction. We soon find out that Sutter's charming demeanor is a mask for a severe lack of self-esteem. He drives for hours with Aimee to see his father, who turns out to be a hopeless alcoholic, makes the teenagers pay the tab for their dinner at a bar and then fails to return after he promises to within an hour. Devastated by his encounter with his father, Sutter pushes Aimee away despite her expressions of love for him; an argument ensues on the way back home and Sutter orders Aimee out of the car. As she steps out, she's hit by a car by fortunately only breaks her arm.Sutter's downward spiral continues as he fails to see Aimee off to school at the bus station. He then goes on a bender and drives drunk back home, knocking down the mailbox on the front lawn, in front of his horrified mother. She, however, consoles him with a heavy dose of motherly love and manages to convince him that he is loved, despite his claims to the contrary.'The Spectacular Now' is a well-made, conventional coming of age story. It's well-acted but the narrative doesn't have a great deal of twists and turns. The resolution of the story is heart-warming, but a bit pat, since that heavy dose of motherly love is enough to turn the troubled Sutter around. For those who like happy endings, 'Now' is for you. But given the extent of Sutter's lack of self-esteem, a few hugs and soothing words from this mother, probably would not have turned him around so fast, in real life.",The Spectacular Now
28,BeneCumb,"Okay Sundance, but there are better ones available",6,20 January 2014,"I am selective in watching US teen and coming-of-age movies as most of them are unvaried, with ""cuties"" vs. ""nerds"", the poor are more high-minded than the rich, ""the rich cry too"" and similar elements and ideas. Plus the fact that in those movies only those over 18 do smoke, drink and have sex... Sundance-movies usually deviate from this, but The Spectacular Now includes too many clichés above; moreover, 18-year-olds are performed by those over 20 - Miles Teller as Sutter Keely was already 25, Brie Larson as Cassidy was 23, Shailene Woodley as Aimee Finecky was 21...; well, performances were good, but the actors did not look younger, but too ""mature"" as for modern teens, thus providing some ideas or expressions inaccurate undertones.

31,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Spectacular Now,5,20 July 2019,5/10 - remarkably disappointing teen drama with almost no likeable characters except the sometimes decent Aimee (Shai Woodley),The Spectacular Now
32,dee.reid,"""The Spectacular Now"" (2013) = The Spectacular Wow!!!",8,30 April 2014,"The best thing that can be said about the beautifully directed 2013 James Ponsoldt feature ""The Spectacular Now"" is that the film mostly lives up to its title. In a wasteland of teenage romance movies, ""The Spectacular Now"" is one of the few to stand out since the beginning of the century (at this point, I would highly suggest Justin Lin's dark 2002 high school indie feature ""Better Luck Tomorrow""), due largely to the unlikely but realistic love story between its two protagonists, and the almost-effortless performances of the young actors portraying them.It must be said that the film belongs squarely to its superb lead actors, who both won well-deserved acting awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival.In a nutshell, ""The Spectacular Now"" is one of the few reasons why we still go to see teen movies anymore. Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley, whom I still remember from ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"") is an earnest people-pleaser and all-around ""good girl"" who, one morning while delivering newspapers, stumbles upon the popular ""life-of-the-party"" classmate Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) sprawled out on a stranger's front lawn following a night of hard partying and drinking. Sutter, who believes in living in the now and Aimee, with her secret aspirations for college and working for NASA, are as unlikely a pair if their ever was one, but their unique friendship gradually blossoms into something more. (I hope that I'm not spoiling that by the time they make love for the first time, it's a tender, gentle, and true-to-life moment that is not like something out of some sleazy porn flick; and like the late Roger Ebert said in his review of the film, it's okay that we don't see her t*ts.)It's clear what Aimee's intentions are from the beginning, when the class clown suddenly finds himself associating with a virtual nobody like her at every available opportunity. Sutter, on the other hand, isn't so easy to gauge. Five minutes into the feature, we witness how a slight misunderstanding in helping a friend get girls eventually leads to the dissolution of his own promising relationship with popular girl Cassidy (Brie Larson). He still has eyes for Cassidy, there's no question about it, and for some time it's not totally clear what his real feelings are, and regarding whether or not he's simply using Aimee as his rebound in a poor effort to make Cassidy jealous. His constant drinking also should cast doubt on what his exact motives are, but we like him, anyway. In fact, it would be a crime against nature to NOT like this guy.The greatest thing about watching Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley in their roles is that their scenes feel almost entirely unscripted. It's this naturalism in their performances and their on-screen chemistry and comfort with one another that make ""The Spectacular Now"" stand out amongst most other similarly themed teen movies (Cameron Crowe's 1989 teen-comedy/romance classic ""Say Anything..."" comes to mind). Their believable rapport owes a lot to the excellently written screenplay by co-screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber - working from the teen novel of the same by author Tim Tharp - who both worked on ""(500) Days of Summer"" (2009), which I have not seen.As usual with most teen movies, adults are almost totally absent, though Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here & there as Sutter's over-worked single mom Sara. While she is not on-screen that much, she makes her few brief appearances - and dialogue - count. She expertly conveys both exhaustion and irritation as Sutter's guardian in what little screen-time she does have, especially when she compares him to her absentee ex-husband and complaining about working a double-shift as a hospital nurse. And yet, in spite of all these loose feelings running about, there's plenty of humor to be had here. Teller's Sutter earns his reputation as the ""life of the party"" through his entertaining barbs and irrepressible, youthful spirit.Whatever flaws the picture does have (a painful reunion between Sutter and his dad, for example) and an almost-near-death tragedy, be assured that the film ends neatly and expectedly before the final credits roll.""The Spectacular Now"" = The Spectacular Wow!!!8/10",The Spectacular Now
33,meeza,Now is when you should see this!,9,5 April 2014,"Put on your specs (if you need them) and take a closer look at a luminous teen romance movie which is very reminiscent of the classic teen flicks of the 80's such as ""Say Anything"", ""Pretty in Pink"", and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". The present-day some kind of wonderful movie I am referring to is ""The Spectacular Now"". The movie stars Miles Teller as Sutter, a hard-partying high school senior who has some internal emotional battles going on. Sutter is a pleasant guy but his hard- partying ways might be a recipe for disaster. He has just been dumped by his ex Cassidy which puts him even more in the partying mode by dealing with the heartbreak. But things quickly change for Sutter, as fast as a Bruce Sutter fastball from the 70's (OK, only baseball fans got that one), in the like of Aimee played by Shailene Woodley; she is a nice, pretty, but not-too-popular classmate of Sutter. They first meet when Aimee finds Sutter passed out on her front lawn. That is when she gets a rifle points it at him and says ""get off my lawn""; Kidding, Kidding! I am writing this as am riding in a Gran Torino. OK, enough. What that lawn incident really commences is a friendship then romance between Sutter & Aimee. Director James Ponsoldt spectacularly orchestrates ""The Spectacular Now"" not with a caricature stereotypical aspect of teenage characters, but with a refreshing authentic look at modern teenage life and the challenges & situations brought upon them in family life, high school environments, and romantic relationships. Sutter lives with his single mom who is estranged from Sutter's father. Sutter is upset with his mom why he cannot get in contact with his father; and that sets up a major ""BabySutter"" moment in the movie; OK, maybe not that baby, but its an integral part of the narrative. Writers Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber's screenplay of the movie was touching, comical, and endearing. Tell him and tell her about it when I say that Miles Teller reminds me of a young Tom Hanks! Did I Sutter, I mean Studder!! His work as Sutter was nothing short of phenomenal. Woodley also brought the acting hardwood here with her astounding work as Aimee. Other admirable acting performances were derived from Brie Larson as Cassidy, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Sutter's sis Holly, Jennifer Jason-Leigh as momma Sara, and Kyle Chandler in a small but poignant role as Sutter's self-absorbed poppa Tommy. ""The Spectacular Now"" might not be the most spectacular film of 2013, but it is one of the most spectacular movies I have seen about teenage life in a long, long time. So live in the now, and go see it right now! ***** Excellent",The Spectacular Now
34,estebangonzalez10,"""You'll always be my favorite ex-boyfriend""",8,8 January 2014,"""You'll always be my favorite ex-boyfriend.""Director James Ponsoldt (Smashed) really set the bar high for this film giving it such a pretentious title, but in all honesty the movie accomplishes exactly that: It is spectacular. This has been a great year for coming of age movies and it is easily becoming one of my favorite genres. I thought I had had enough with MUD, The Way Way Back, and Kings of Summer, but The Spectacular Now managed to bring something new and unique to the equation. This is one of those High School films that feels authentic with three dimensional characters and a solid screenplay. The writers for 500 Days of Summer (another film I enjoyed), Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, did an incredible job adapting Tim Tharp's novel and their screenplay benefits from great performances from Woodley and Teller. Actually the entire cast is impressive in this film and it is really hard to think of another Hollywood film that has created such natural and authentic High School characters. At first glance you might think this is just another clichéd romantic teen comedy where the popular kid from school falls for the nerdy and sweet girl, but this film does it in such a unique and mature way that it only uses this known premise to explore other important themes. The Spectacular Now is a balanced film that blends romantic and comic touches with some serious and dramatic moments. It reminds us all that it was not always easy to be a teen considering how specific moments touched and shaped us during our transition to adulthood.Sutter (Miles Teller) is a charming and popular High School senior who everyone seems to like. There is no party if he isn't around. He is happy with his life and embraces the now. When his girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson), dumps him he decides to do what he does best which is to party. The next morning Aimee (Shailene Woodley) finds hims passed out in her lawn and wakes him. Of course she recognizes him from school and introduces herself. She is nothing like him, she is sweet and shy, and has never had a boyfriend. Sutter has no idea where he has parked his car so he asks Aimee if he can ride with her while she does her mother's paper route. Despite their differences the two connect and begin to bond. Sutter is still very much in love with Cassidy, but at the same time he believes he can help Aimee become more confident. He may be a popular kid, but he realizes that he isn't going anywhere with his life and that is the main reason why Cassidy dumped him. Aimee on the other hand is either blinded by her love for him or actually does see some good in him. They're both at a turning point in their lives and despite their differences both of them think they can have a positive effect on the other.Despite the familiar premise this film has a lot of depth and goes places others in the same genre never do. It also does it in such a way that it never feels heavy handed or manipulative. Yes there may be some rushed moments, but the story is so well crafted that it has an authentic and raw vibe to it. Woodley and Teller are so natural that you forget they are acting. The film just strikes all the right notes making it impossible to be emotionally detached to it. You really care for these characters and fear they will hurt one another. It is just such an honest depiction of teenage life where not only friends influence their lives, but the entire surroundings (parents, teachers, employers) shape them. The center of the film really is Sutter as his world (the spectacular now) begins to shake and alcohol doesn't seem like the easiest way out anymore. It may not be until halfway through the film that you realize that the main theme isn't the relationship between him and Aimee, but the way they each have to deal with the transitions and changes in their lives. Two scenes stood out for me, the first being Sutter's encounter with his father and the second near the end where he embraces his mother. The supporting performances in this film were also very rich. Kudos to Brie Larsen, Kyle Chandler (Sutter's father), and Jennifer Jason Leigh (his mother). They were all simply spectacular. This is a film that stays with you because it never feels false and remains fresh.",The Spectacular Now

A high school senior with a drinking problem gets two things:drunk and dumped by his girlfriend, after which he passes out on his female neighbor's lawn and winds up falling for her.This movie focuses on focusing on the here and now, family problems, relationships, troubles growing up, and other things. I love the parts about his going out to find his father and the accident scene. The latter was well done. I think the work scenes where Sutter (the main character) in the bow tie store are also good.

37,jfgibson73,Kid with a lot of potential,6,31 May 2015,"I guess this movie was a tragedy. It focuses on a high school senior named Sutter, who might be the most popular kid in his small town. But he's got issues, and that's the focus of this low budget indie drama (not sure if it's actually low budget or an indie, but that's exactly what it feels like). He starts to care about a girl named Aimee, and their relationship is what drives his development. He had broken up with another girl who was as popular as him, and for some part of the movie, it seems like the choices he makes are part of a plan to get her back. Aimee's main character trait is that she's not that popular. She's a sweet, caring kid, so we care about her and worry what will happen if Sutter is screwing her over. More and more, it seems like he really does have her best interests in mind, though we're never sure. There is a realism to how it unfolds, because Sutter himself doesn't seem sure what he is doing, and so the story isn't entirely linear, but more slice-of-life, which is probably what some people didn't like about it. Eventually, Sutter reconnects with his dad, and it's not a positive experience. He ends up throwing away his relationship and job prospects because he feels he isn't deserving or doesn't have what it would take to be successful in them. I haven't made up my mind about the open-ended finale scene, but supposedly the director thinks we should know exactly where it was going. I didn't, and I'm not sure I'd watch it through again to see what I missed, but it did having me thinking about it for some time.",The Spectacular Now
38,aidanratesmovies,More than just a teen film,10,1 February 2020,"Although it may be rather simple and/or seemingly average at first glance, The Spectacular Now brings a new breath of fresh air to the teen film genre, with some splendid performances and a heartfelt story that is bound to hit you hard. What ties the film together so perfectly is its balance of story and characters, by providing such a personal and upfront look at the people within it and their experiences throughout. James Ponsoldt puts a wonderful spin on the film's source material, and Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley make for some great performances. The cinematography in the film, is certainly different for a film of this kind, but gripping and impactful- playing perfectly with the honest look of these characters and their lives. In the end, The Spectacular Now is a teen film done right with such a great balance of talent, it's more than worth forgiving its flaws.
My Rating: 9.75/10",The Spectacular Now
39,Amari-Sali,"With an ilk of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, there is The Spectacular Now.",9,2 August 2013,"This week I found myself seeing a movie featuring Shailene Woodley of Secret Life of the American Teenager and The Descendants fame; Brie Larson, who I mostly know from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and The United States of Tara; and the familiar faces of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Andre Royo. The main draw though was a trailer attached to The Way, Way Back I believe, and since Shailene Woodley is starting to prove that her work on Secret Life was more due to bad writing than whatever skills she may possess, I find myself following her career a bit. Now, going into characters, the lead role of Sutter (played by Miles Tiller) feels very much like an audition piece to be in a remake of Ferris Bueller. Tiller has the charisma, the timing and the look of someone who can be a more average looking heartthrob, but he also has this vulnerability in his performance as Sutter which helps him make the character not seem as inspired by Bueller, for it feels like you get to understand why Sutter does what he does, says what he says and how all this creates the person we see. For, to me, the way Sutter is written really does help make this movie seem less like a fantasy romance, but something could be considered authentic with a few embellishments. Unfortunately though, Aimee (played by Shailene Woodley) feels like a weird mix of the traditional female lead who only becomes vibrant because of the male lead, but at the same time it feels like she is more fleshed out than the traditional female lead for she has interest and goals outside of being with the male lead. This leads me to talking about the story: The movie starts off almost in a Romeo & Juliet type of way. Sutter seems to have this great girl in Cassidy (played by Brie Larson) but like Rosaline, she grows tired of Sutter and basically wants something, or someone, who takes life a bit more seriously. From there, like Romeo, Sutter goes into a type of depression, which involves drinking and driving, and ends up on a random person's lawn. Enter Aimee, a sort of Juliet, and from there things begin with Sutton seemingly investing in Aimee for her kindness, and then you quickly can feel and see, a romance which blossoms almost against Sutter's original intentions. As time goes on, and he gets more comfortable with the idea of dating Aimee, you begin to notice just how much he really needed someone like her in his life. For, as much as he pushes her out her comfort zone, she does the same for him and through this we see her as more than a simple love interest which is quite beautiful to watch. The situations they go through together, and speak about, makes this feel like more than a book adaptation, which all signs point to being a work of fiction, but perhaps someone's life written onto screen. And that is probably what I like the most about this film. Being someone who loves romance movies, I have a slight issue of ones that have the guy or girl go over the top like in The Notebook where he is literally hanging from a Ferris Wheel to coerce a girl to go out with him; or other movies where it just feels like their relationship is based more on grand gestures than the basic foundation of being friends and there for each other during the hard times and decisions. But, with Aimee and Sutter, you can see them bring the best out of each other and even during the almost obligatory scene(s) when, usually, the guy does something stupid, the movie decides to steer things toward reminding you that fights and accidents don't always lead to huge blow ups, but are sometimes simply things that happen when two people try to have their lives fit into almost one existence.Which sort of leads to an issue I had with the film: Aimee, while lovable, just feels so generic at times. For though she does get fleshed out, it almost feels like she is the Eve to Sutton's Adam and not in a positive or romantic way. To me, Aimee sometimes feels like the same quiet, slightly aloof, shy girl we always see who thanks to this extroverted guy becomes almost a new person who now is brimming with confidence. Also, as mentioned earlier, every romantic movie has a scene when things get too real, usually for the guy, and this leads to a blow up. Now, the blow up in this film is something shocking and I felt it was forgiven just a bit too quickly. If, or when, you decide to see the movie, you'll understand what I mean.Overall: Go See It Admittedly, I'm a sucker for a good romance film. This film brings all that and more. We have the comical persona of Sutton; the romance Aimee brings out of the story; Cassidy who reminds us of the difficulty of being around our first love, while trying to move on; Ms. Keely (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Mr. Keely (played by Kyle Chandler) remind us of the difficulty and effect our relationships with our parents can bring; and all this is wrapped up together in a movie which feels like more than a coming of age romance drama, but perhaps someone's life with just a touch of embellishment. That is why I recommend this movie. I can't say it is going to become iconic like The Notebook, but to me it is amongst the great realistic portrayals of the issues which come from being on the brink of graduating High School and starting to see that transition to adulthood coming, and knowing that you still have a lot of unresolved things from your childhood to deal with, much less growing up to do.",The Spectacular Now
40,jadepietro,The Days of Beer and Roses,7,15 September 2013,"This film is recommended.The Spectacular Now is that rare teenage love story that shows the real life dilemmas that many of today's adolescents face on a daily basis. The film lives in the ""now"", just as its male protagonist proclaims as his philosophy of life. Sutter Keely is a confused and aimless party boy, unwilling to look to his future or deal with his past mistakes. He is also an alcoholic, drunk for most of the time and on the prowl for hedonistic fun and laughs.The film's trailer downplays this angle and plays up the teenage angst of peer pressure and dating. But this is not, thankfully, a John Hughes rosy-colored comedy.  It is more like Days of Wine and Roses for the younger set. And that, makes the film all the more watchable.  The script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, the writing team that created the underrated (500) Days of Summer, presents Sutter's alcohol-laced world with frightening clarity and capture the pathos and confusion of young love very well, but the screenwriters tend to overplays much of the teenage drinking throughout the film and create some predictable characters and situations in the process. (I personally found some of the scenes lack credibility with students drinking on school property without any consequences or any adult intervention taking place. When a criminal act occurs later in the film, there is no repercussion or further mention of the act.) That being said, much of The Spectacular Now is still a successful honest treatment of alcoholism and its far reaching effects. Even if parts of the film don't always make sense, its impact is lasting due to solid direction and fine acting.Director James Ponsoldt has assembled a terrific cast of talented actors to state his case. The two leads have a wonderful chemistry between them and their natural performances add to the film's overall impact. Miles Teller plays the unreliable Sutter and he takes this rather unlikeable character and makes the moviegoer care about the boy and his tragic dead end. Shailene Woodley is luminous as his unlikely love interest, Aimee, a typical bright teenager who has never fallen in love or much less dated.  Her sad decline is heartbreaking and Shailene makes her vulnerability and misguided attempts at love all the more believable. Strong support is also given by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kyle Chandler as Sutter's divorced parents, Bob Odenkirk as his caring boss, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his distant sister. Brie Larson and Masam Holden are also effective as Sutter's ex-girlfriend and his close buddy.The Spectacular Now is far from spectacular, but the film is a fine and worthwhile drama about a serious subject that is mostly ignored nowadays. For that reason alone (plus the excellent acting involved), it deserves your attention. GRADE: BANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The Spectacular Now
41,Seraphion,Nicely curious,6,16 July 2015,"The story is an example of how a persistent and consistent story development takes place. I like how the character Sutter stays true on his believes even though he knows it's the wrong one in the view of the rest of his society and even his deep down thoughts. Yet there's also the character Aimee who's literally clueless at what life has for her, both the good ones and the bad. Both characters remain almost all the same until the movie's end, thus it's ending becomes quite predictable. But the movie can nicely ignite curiosity on whether the characters will change or not. Interestingly the change happens to the supporting characters while the main characters only stand by the sidelines. The acting overall is a nice one for me. Miles Teller really proves that this is one of his best earlier performances while Shailene Woodley only did a meager performance in my view",The Spectacular Now
42,pc95,Scratches Surface,6,17 March 2014,"Though ""The Spectacular Now"" is a well shot, fairly well directed and acted movie, as a teenager character movie, it has some problems with it's core content and focus. I thought the lead character was not very well written. The writers fail to adequately flesh out his true feelings and instead his plight seems superficial at times and confusing at others. We can see that he drinks, but he never really is honest with himself or other characters completely around him. Because of this aloofness the film doesn't connect too well. Someone might argue that this is reflective how teenagers are, but if a movie is focusing on characters there needs to be some direct honesty. Even still, the movie has some good scenes and value for watching, just it didn't quite make to it's potential. 6/10",The Spectacular Now
43,denis888,Empty Trifle,1,15 January 2018,"I love both Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley , and I consider Mary Elizabeth Winstead to be awesome, but hey, come on, what a piece of empty trifle, mere baloney I have just watched? I mean, I am serious, this is a total waste of time, film amd effort. Nothing deep, or sincere, or touching, or decent here. What we see is...er...drinking. Much alcohol abuse, drinking, some making out, drunken talks, empty drama, shallow development, insincere dialog, useless twists, worthless effort, and voila, what we see is a very weak, very naive, very silly childish attampt at something deep but falling miserably behind, and lagging at each step. I was rubbing my eyes in utter disbelief, trying to catch any sign of anything solid or sensational. Instead, I saw a sleepy slow boerd Woodley, and wooden boring Teller. Why was this film made? No idea. What message did it deiver? No message. What worth did it bring? Nothing. Just a dull thud, boring yawn and useless effort.",The Spectacular Now
44,Sergeant_Tibbs,"One of the most honest, joyous, empathetic and mature films to capture the teenage experience.",8,23 January 2014,"It doesn't matter how much you know about the film, it feels like everyone who walks out The Spectacular Now and loves it echoes ""I didn't expect that."" I was the same, and I heard that response many times. It shouldn't be such a spectacular film, upon description there's nothing particularly special about it. Everything just works in the best way possible to bring out a sub- genre we didn't know could be this good. Perhaps it's because James Ponsoldt's most recent and prominent film, Smashed, was relatively lightweight for its topic. It was a very enjoyable, charming and occasionally powerful film, headlined by Mary Elizabeth Winstead's terrific performance, but it didn't live out the concept's full potential. Entering The Spectacular Now meets some resistance. We're greeted with a regurgitated scene from every other teen movie. But instead of a studio-lit shiny surface, it's a sharply edited and beautifully textured montage that escalates beyond expectation. As our protagonist Sutter drifts from his ex-girlfriend Cassidy and moves onto the inexperienced Aimee, the first act feels the pure joy of discovery and optimism.I really didn't buy Miles Teller at first. I didn't like the character either. I couldn't see him as the popular party kid who's unattainable. On the flip side, it was difficult to see Shailene Woodley as the unpopular nerdy kid. But what felt like miscasting, was simply casting against type that slowly grew on me over the course of the film as they convinced me more and more. Their first kiss is such an unexpected elation that I was taken off guard by how invested in their relationship I was. It's all thanks to the honest way the film is approached. Mostly shot in long single takes, but without sacrificing any cinematic atmosphere, it captures everything in the performances and there's not a false note to be found. Great acting is all about living in the moment and that's exactly the film's ethos. At first I thought it was a compilation soundtrack, but most of the film's music is an original score by Rob Simonsen. His work for the film is absolute magic. It's quirky, but grounded, and enriches the world with his organic orchestra. However, once we get to the meat of the second act and Sutter and Aimee are together, a terrible sense of dread shrouds the film. Although it's the best thing that's happened to her, we know he isn't in for the full ride.It's a testament to the economic and honest way the script is written that such familiar material can carry the full weight of emotion. But this isn't the extent of the film's power. It's in the film's reflective third act, with a brilliant, albeit short performance from the always-welcome- in-anything-I-watch Kyle Chandler, that the film hits real emotional issues. I may not relate to Sutter in as many ways as I wish I could but the power of the film is almost too strong as I think of it now with a warm heavy sigh. Despite all the inner demons, anxieties about the future, anxieties about the now, it's outweighed by that beautiful sense of hope in its final beats. I've never seen a film capture the teenage experience with such bliss, maturity and empathy like this before. I hope the film grows on me more with time, but it cuts to a tender nerve that's unbearable to acknowledge sometimes. The Spectacular Now was a real pleasant surprise. James Ponsoldt is an incredibly talented and thoughtful director in all the senses and I'm certain he has a favourite-worthy film buried in him somewhere. He just needs deeper and more original material. Perhaps without an alcoholic next time.8/10",The Spectacular Now
45,rivertam26,Brilliant and painfully honest,10,29 August 2013,"You know when you see those movies and you say they just don't make these anymore. Well this is that type of movie. Joining the ranks of the best teen movies ever made and possibly the most honest of the bunch The Spectacular now is absolutely brilliant. The film centers on Sutter played charmingly by Miles Teller a charming teenage alcoholic who after a breakup with his girlfriend Cassidy befriends a painfully Naive young girl names Aimee played effortlessly by the mega talented Shailene Woodley. Both of the characters are so complex and so is their story. Like so many other films concerning this age group it is coming of age but unlike most others it doesn't fall into any clichés and offers no easy answers. Equally moving, touching, hilarious and even a little shocking this film is painfully genuine. A true testament to the choices and experiences that shape you as a person. Miles Teller is brilliant as Sutter he's charming and damaged you go back and forth between loving and hating him and easily relatable sometimes in the worst ways and very reminiscent of a young John Cusack in his hey day. Shailene Woodley is so confident in her portrayal of Aimee so naive, vulnerable and insecure desperately in search of acceptance and love because of her home situation. But that's not where the great performances end. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Sutter's sister Holly steals her scenes, Brie Larson as his girlfriend Cassidy, Jennifer Jason Leigh as his hard working mother Sara, Kyle Chandler as his father and just the whole cast feels so real. The Spectacular Now isn't just the bets film of the year it's an incredible experience. It's the type f film you leave haven't learned something. A film that inspires you to make changes. 5/5",The Spectacular Now
46,napierslogs,Floats around life with two good performances,6,29 January 2014,"""The Spectacular Now"" is about one character trying to live in the now. Sutter (Miles Teller) is applying to university using inappropriate words and has no qualms about the amount of alcohol he drinks. The film is light enough in the beginning that it seems okay to laugh, but nobody did. It just wasn't funny enough. The lack of comedy suggested the film was going to get darker, but it took too long to get there.There was a connection to the characters that was missing, but that's a likely consequence of having a main character trying to float above life. Sutter survives off his charm, magnetic-appeal and likability and he rarely feels any urgency in maturing. Which also means the film takes its time floating around Sutter as he floats above life.Sutter meets a girl. Aimee (Shailene Woodley) comes from a similarly damaging family, but she's trying her hardest to make a new life for herself. Aimee's not Sutter's usual type of girl. She's genuine, sweet, honest, caring and likable. She's not like Sutter at all, and their pairing proves to be beneficial to the film and quite possibly to each other. But why actually work at life when you can just float above it?Teller gives a fairly remarkable performance as Sutter. He doesn't strike me as the charismatic type but his line delivery and his ability to show the nuances within his character make you forget that. Woodley is her beautiful self and portrays another earnest teenage girl. Their romantic pairing is certainly better than most recent teenager films.But ""The Spectacular Now"" is about living in the ""now"" which at every point seems very much like the past and the future. It just takes too long to provide anything significant at the core of Sutter.",The Spectacular Now
47,brchthethird,Overly familiar love story with excellent lead performances,6,7 October 2014,"While it has some degree of .authenticity and an excellent performance by Miles Teller, his character is ultimately too unlikeable in a movie that aims to inspire. Miles Teller plays Sutter Keeley, a high school senior with some major issues. Chief among them is his reluctance to think about anything but the present, with no regard for his future. He's also kind of a douche-bag and a budding alcoholic. Fresh off of breaking up with his girlfriend (for those reasons), he rebounds with a quiet girl named Aimee (Shailene Woodley). During their time together, they begin to rub off on each other, although it's more onto her than him. Some of the moments between them were genuinely sweet, although the water is muddied a bit when he tries to get back with his ex. There's also an absentee father in the mix, and who Sutter is quickly shaping up to be like. Basically, he is a person at odds with everyone in his life and the whole gist of the movie is that he needs to realize that he's better than he thinks he is. The only problem with that is that when the change does come it doesn't feel natural at all. In fact, he's such an unlikeable person that it's surprising that he's gotten through to at all. Through all of this, Shailene Woodley does an admirable job as the girlfriend who sees the potential within him, but even she ends up getting used as a plot device (and a rather crass, shocking one at that). Ultimately I enjoyed it more than most YA novel adaptations thanks to them not sanitizing the material for a PG-13 rating, but it still doesn't change the fact that (to me) the ending should have had more of an impact than it did. There were also a number of occasions where I caught myself rolling my eyes at some of the dialogue I was hearing. It's at the upper end of teen romances, but honestly that's not saying too much.",The Spectacular Now
48,sharky_55,I like to think there's more to a person than just one thing.,8,18 July 2018,"How refreshing is it to find a teen drama that does not condescend its viewers, and serve up familiar character archetypes as if we need our hands held in order to navigate the plot of a coming of age story. These characters refuse to be defined by simplistic labels like so many cinematic replicas of high school often do. Notice how although Marcus and Cassidy are antagonists - in the sense that they oppose Sutter's objectives - they are never made out as villains. How often do these popular jocks wail on the main characters, only to get their comeuppance in the end? Yet Cassidy has her own legitimate reasons for breaking it off with Sutter, despite their obvious chemistry, and Marcus is revealed to be envious of Sutter's charismatic pull, and both learn valuable lessons from the other, including admitting their own shortcomings. Early on you get the impression of Sutter Keely as casually charming, to the point of falling into arrogance. Teller brought this over to Whiplash, too. He prides himself on being the life of the party, for dating the it girl for ""two months longer than anyone else"", and for being the go to guy for helping out with anything, whether it be booze for a party, or propping up a shy, socially outcast girl's confidence. When his friend queries him on his intentions, the tone of his response implies that he is doing her a favour. This is condescension, although Aimee flocks to the unexpected attention like a firefly anyway. It makes sense that he is a salesman - he makes others feel good, although most importantly it makes him feel good about himself. Rewinding and watching it again, we realise there are touches of kindness behind this arrogance, as if Sutter is trying to prove something to himself. He's good at it, so why not? There is no clearly defined point where he realises that this relationship might be mutually beneficial, where he discovers that maybe he, too, deserves the same sort of affection that he hands out freely as a 'favour'. There is a sex scene that is driven by their shared intimacy, instead of focusing on the nudity. And there is the way they prop each other up as they confront their own domestic trauma, including the quietly sad moment where they are forced to pool loose change in order to cover the tab of a father who has never bothered. Sutter lives in the spectacular now, but after seeing his own mottos reflected in his deadbeat, estranged father, he wonders if there is a life beyond waking up hungover on anonymous lawns in an anonymous small suburban town. How much longer can he use alcohol as a way of smothering his problems? Ponsoldt makes drinking a pervasive part of his life, normalised through discreet hip flasks during school and work, but avoids using it as a dramatic pitfall. Aimee begins to show signs of turning into a 'lush' too, but the realisation must come from within themselves. In many of these stories it takes the courage and sensitivity of a girl to 'fix' the broken guy wallowing in self pity, but here they learn hard on each other, and gradually work their way towards recognising their flaws. Both admit to being harmful for the other, but are nevertheless drawn together by some messy mix of loyalty, possessiveness, compassion and desperation. Remember John Cusack hoisting his boombox to serenade Ione Skye under her window in Say Anything? That happened in the middle of the movie, and fell on deaf ears, because the pair still had so much growing left to do. The same goes for Sutter and Aimee on the steps of Philadelphia.",The Spectacular Now
49,Quietb-1,Very far from spectacular,2,7 August 2013,"Here's a dialogue driven coming of age comedy drama. They walk and talk, stand and talk, sit at the table and talk. The dialogue is continuous and far from spectacular. The two most effective scenes have no dialogue; dad through the bar window, and the final scene at college.There was one outstanding location but a choice was made to leave it and walk and talk in the woods. When characters lie revealing their back story it is difficult to like or trust them. Sutter lied about his father.

52,bryank-04844,'The Spectacular Now' is a wonderful look into a flawed character who we want to see succeed. The film delivers on several deep and emotional levels.,8,22 August 2015,"From the director of 'Smashed' and the writers of '(500) Days of Summer' comes a charming little gem called 'The Spectacular Now'. In a way, this is a high-school movie, but one that's wholly original and incredibly acted by its young adult cast. The film tackles a few big subjects like alcoholism, abandonment and depression, but the appealing cast keeps us wanting more.The movie centers on high school senior Sutter Keely (Miles Teller), who can talk to anybody, can make lifelong friends in ten seconds flat, and is usually the life of the party. Even the star athlete and class president wishes that he had as much charm as Keely. However, Keely rarely makes decent grades, always has a flask full of alcohol, and has never once planned for his future. He's only concerned with the ""now."" After his longtime girlfriend leaves him, Sutter goes on a drinking binge and wakes up the next morning sprawled on someone's lawn.That someone is classmate Aimee (Shailene Woodley), the quiet girl in school who makes good grades and loves science fiction and anime. The two hit it off fast. At first, Sutter thinks that Aimee is an easy rebound, but then he really falls for her. The two go on several dates, and Sutter invites Amiee over to dinner with his older sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). We find out that Aimee's dad passed away a few years ago, and that Sutter's dad left the family when he was little. Sutter and his sister have had no real contact with their father, since their mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has forbidden it.Aimee convinces Sutter to locate his dad (Kyle Chandler), and the two venture out to see him. His father is a good-looking guy, but we soon realize why his mother has kept her kids away from him. After an afternoon of drinking in a dive bar, his dad ditches Sutter and leaves him with the bar tab, only to go a few miles down the road and keep drinking with his friends. This scares Sutter deeply, and he soon realizes that he's following the same path. A few dramatic situations unfold, until the big mother-son talk that could put Sutter on the right track again.Teller is an amazing actor and gives a stellar performance as a young man who can charm anyone while hiding his depression. Woodley makes us fall in love with her very fast, just like Sutter did. Leigh and Chandler turn in great performances too. 'The Spectacular Now' is a wonderful look into a flawed character who we want to see succeed. The film delivers on several deep and emotional levels.",The Spectacular Now
53,witster18,"short, sweet, but impact would depend on how relative the subplots are to the viewer",8,20 January 2014,"It works for me.I was a lot like the lead character here. Mr. Popular.. more interested in short term gain than long-term goals. I drank too much, and it seriously affected my future, ambitions, and my health. My wife hasn't seen her father.. for well... her whole life.. even though he's still alive, and I've had my own issues with mine. These are the serious 'themes' of ""The Spectacular Now"" - so I guess this film probably struck more of an emotional chord in my household than it might in others. This is a simple but serious story.The acting is strong across the board. Miles and Shailene are two of the best young actors in the business. I started to seek-out Miles after his performance in ""21 and Over"", and Shailene was fantastic in ""The Descendents"". They make the perfect couple here.This is a pretty big departure from ""500 Days of Summer""(the directors last big hit), but it still envelopes the same age demographic.This is probably more along the lines of ""Perks of Being A Wallflower"". While it lacks a bit of style of that great film,.. it hits just as hard on the serious notes.This has moved into the top 20 of 2013 for now(15). It should hold onto a top 25 spot, even after I finish the remaining 20 films on my 2013 watchlist.I heard they shot this in just over three weeks. Amazing. Really shows the strength of the acting here. Solid script, solid cast, and well-put-together. Not over-thinking this probably did nothing but help the end-result.recommended. 74/100 My main gripe is that the film seems just a bit rushed for me.

54,Sir_AmirSyarif,Not your average tale of teen romance,7,30 May 2021,"James Ponsoldt's 'The Spectacular Now' focuses on most teen experiences: first love relationship, ""living in the now"" attitude towards life, fear of the future, alcohol, and family issues. It is a lovely, heartfelt, sweet, gentle, and sincere film, with performances that feel raw and sensitive. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are fantastic, deliver strong convincing performance to let us believe that the love chemistry between them is real and managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film. While the supporting cast - from Brie Larson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Kyle Chandler, to Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Bob Odenkirk, and Kaitlyn Dever - is not in it quite a lot, they manage to deliver exactly what is required of them, and make a very solid impact on the story and characters.",The Spectacular Now
55,Likes_Ninjas90,Both actors have contrasting acting styles but still find common emotional footing,7,2 December 2013,"Part of the reason why high school films are often sanitised is because they have to be suitable to attract the very demographics they are portraying. Perhaps there is also the factor of adults not wanting to confront the truth about what their children are doing away from them. The Spectacular Now is an odd addition to the high school canon. Distributed by Disney here in Australia, a company that specialises in mostly wholesome entertainment, the film is upfront about the frequency of alcohol is the lives of high schoolers and that some students are not as clever as they think and seem destined to be failures like their parents. Yet simultaneously, the film is conventional in its character arcs, predetermined for its terribly flawed central character to become a less selfish individual and learn some important life lessons. It's an affecting story but will there ever be a film where the lesson is just how irreparable everything is? There is still honesty about many of the film's situations and the problems of its terribly flawed central character. With great assurance Miles Teller (Rabbit Hole) creates an extremely cocky and arrogant anti- hero in Sutter, a class clown who broke up with his girlfriend due to a social misunderstanding. He takes little account of the fact that he drinks too much, carrying a hip flask in his pocket and is failing one of his classes. In spite of this seemingly unlikable character, the film grounds itself through Shailene Woodley's note perfect performance. Graced with utter naturalism, she plays Aimee, a sweet and very measured girl, who has a secretive nature and mystery surrounding her. She meets Sutter one morning when he is lying on her lawn after a drunken night out. Both actors have contrasting acting styles but still find common emotional footing. Woodley's has a reserved tentativeness drawn from her character's willingness to be selfless around other people. She pays for her mother's bills through a paper run and bonds with Sutter when she agrees to coach him for one of his classes. Meanwhile, Teller engages us by exuding flamboyant comic energy that overcomes the immobile juvenility of his character's frat boy exterior. The relationship that blossoms between these two characters is psychological and personal. It is built from the way they encourage one another to be more proactive in their lives and overcoming the emotional holes of the past as they are both dissatisfied by the absence of their fathers. I like the way the director James Ponsoldt also employs a visual style that gives time for the actors to inhabit their characters. There are a number of moments, including a walk at a party and a frank sex scene, photographed in long, single takes so that the romantic temperament and social tensions are heightened by the believable chemistry of the leads. The screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is also funny and refuses to skimp over personal details for the characters. On this level, I enjoyed the film more than their previous collaboration (500) Days of Summer, which by comparison seemed overly glossy, imbalanced and disinterested in its female lead. The strength of their writing is that on top of the comedy they skilfully use a subplot involving Sutter's previous girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson) to embed dramatic tension into the main narrative thread. Is Sutter on the rebound and just using this very kind, engaging girl to hit back at his ex? The way that these two plot points often overlap in the same scenes, as Sutter looks over to his ex to see if she's listening, is compelling. This also creates ambiguity and uncertainty around the stability of the central relationship. As Aimee becomes more assertive, drinks more frequently and then starts thinking seriously about their arrangement, we wonder if her world will come crashing down. You're left with a feeling of dread in your stomach, thinking of the inevitable heartbreak and pain. The second half isn't quite as satisfying. A different subplot involving Sutter's father Tommy (scruffily played by a boozing Kyle Chandler) takes precedence over his relationship with Aimee. This means that the dramatic payoff doesn't come organically through an ongoing stream of conflict between the two young leads. You're left waiting for the payoff between the story of the ex-girlfriend and Aimee and it never eventuates in a satisfying way. Instead, there's a big, shocking climax that takes us into a third act but despite its dramatic charge, it doesn't result in any personal conflict between Aimee and Sutter. The weakest parts are in the denouement where lifestyle changes are made, several honesty sessions take place and a voice over reminisces about leaving the past behind. It takes the heat out of what could have been something painful and ultimately true. Growing up and coming of age is about experiencing pain and realising that not everyone is going to change and look at their behaviour and actions. Some people will never take account for who they are. Maybe for the sake of some troubled kids these high school films should show what unchanging people look like, instead of what their parents want them to be.",The Spectacular Now

57,griffolyon12,A Spoiler-Free Review,6,10 November 2013,"Director James Ponsoldt's film, The Spectacular Now, is a film that tries to be more than its material actually allows it to be, ultimately taking itself far more seriously than the material allows, making the final act of the film fairly melodramatic. In the film, actor Miles Teller portrays Sutter, a hard-partying high school Senior who gives no thoughts to his future, and then he starts dating nice girl Aimme, portrayed by Shailene Woodley, and of course complications ensue and Sutter's views on life are challenged. If you are a fan of Ponsoldt's previous directorial efforts, you will probably find much to enjoy here, but if you aren't, you will be disappointed, especially considering the film festival buzz that came off this one. The thing isn't that The Spectacular Now is a poorly made film, it is well acted and well shot, with some truly phenomenal single take scenes, but the film's lack of humor and overseriousness, not only makes the film exceptionally depressing, but it also makes the film traipse into cliché and melodrama near the end in order to try and make stakes out of the story. Ultimately, for a film with so much hype and talent, for it to feel so scripted and not realistic when the emotional beats most matter, it makes this a film that is really only worth viewing for admirers of great acting.I give The Spectacular Now a 6 out of 10!",The Spectacular Now
58,christophe92300,Not fully accomplished,5,19 January 2014,"The Spectacular Now isn't devoid of qualities, the dialogues are rather well written, the mise-en-scène is interesting, as is the cast, especially Miles Teller in fact who is really impressive, certainly an actor to follow.The problem of this movie is that its scenario doesn't exploit correctly or sufficiently the elements on which it relies on. It should have gone deeper into things, the alcohol for example, though omnipresent in Sutter's everyday life, doesn't pay off in the end despite being an essential part of the character. The ex-girlfriend, the new girlfriend, the mom, the father, everyone of these characters and the related issues fit together badly, without much coherence, not to mention that some motivations, actions or reactions are a bit hard to justify.The Spectacular Now is therefore a not fully accomplished movie, that stands out more for its form than its content.",The Spectacular Now
59,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Romeo And Juliet's Mellow Ancestors,9,22 August 2013,"A cross between John Cusack's pontificating nice guy in SAY ANYTHING and Chris Penn's boozing jock in THE WILD LIFE, a refreshingly average/realistic looking Miles Teller plays Sutter, the most popular kid in high school and a known campus party animal. It's surprising to several people (himself included) when he hooks up with smart girl Aimee, played by THE DESCENDANTS actress Shailene Woodley, and their romance blossoms.The nice thing about SPECTACULAR NOW is it's not that spectacular, and never tries to be. In several scenes, awkward moments play out without intrusive cuts... like the couple's first sexual experience or anytime Sutter's confidence trumps those around him... making the film seem more realistic than catered to mainstream audiences.Although Miles Teller plays the role a bit too grownup, often coming across more like a used car salesman than high schooler, and his routine drinking habit would better fit a thirty-five year old construction worker, he makes the part work, balancing vulnerability and wild card cockiness around ordinary people with their lives already mapped out. Meanwhile, an intentionally plain looking Woodley remains a solid foundation, and their scenes together are never sappy or pretentious.The third act – as Sutter meets his estranged father – could have been the point where melodrama replaces the story's casual pace, but thankfully even the most intense moments remain on an even-keel that, like the main character's personality, will keep you involved from start to finish.",The Spectacular Now
60,dansview,Earnest Effort,6,26 September 2016,"I had to stop watching before the last quarter of the film. The girl looked about 14 to me, so it made me squeamish to see her going through such things. I later found out that the actress was about 22.Miles Teller brought some genuine sensitivity and original charisma to his character. The girl character was easier to play. Just niceness basically.I liked the portrayal of the conflict between living for the moment and doing things that will help you in the future. That key scene on the ex-girlfriend's bed was effective. They explain their two philosophies.It was depressing to think of how many teens are flying on auto-pilot. There's no effective guidance from anyone beyond their peer group. The geometry teacher tries.The girl gives up her virginity as if it's all part of some comic strip. She even giggles through it. Meanwhile she will never be able to offer that to another man. I didn't watch the whole thing. Did she confess that she was not a virgin anyways? Good direction in terms of positioning the guy passed out on a lawn, the girl looking over him, and the two ultimately tossing newspapers. There were touches of Say Anything of course, but also Vision Quest. The optimistic guy who takes life as it comes, but also thinks a lot.There was not much musical manipulation from what I remember. I actually appreciated that. Although granted Say Anything had the Peter Gabriel song moment. Music can add something memorable, but it also manipulates us.I also liked the way the lead explains to the clueless girl that guys at the outdoor party were in fact thinking of her in a romantic sense. A girl like that wouldn't recognize that.Having said all that, I never met any guy like him or any girl like her in high school. Our loud mouth wise guys were good students, and there were no cute nerdy girls with wholesome intentions.My understanding is that there was not a definitive happy ending. That's good, because our lead must do remedial work both academically and socially to catch up to his peers. I wouldn't want to see the message that you can skate by on humor alone.My favorite line came from the guy who was dating her ex, when he says that the lead is not as big a joke as people think he is. It seemed like the first time he realized that people view him that way.So, good dialog, an appealing performance by Teller, attractive physical settings, while perhaps clichéd conflicts.",The Spectacular Now
61,in1984,"Teen Fun, Uncertainty, and Doubt brought Together",7,3 January 2014,"7 of 10. Excellent teen story that captures a lot of nuances of growing up, and being an adult (including not just parents), that rarely get reflected in stories or film centered on teens.Despite benefiting from wide-screen filming, it has a TV show like haze hanging over it, largely from what seems like low-budget directing and casting, with only Jennifer Jason-Leigh providing a much too under used exception. Nonetheless, the story carries it and the lead teen actors perform well enough to bring together a story that can neither be described as happy nor tragic, or both.The only clichés in this teen film are the clearly older than high-school cast and mismatch of parents and children. Fortunately, the book this is based on apparently makes up for the consistently disappointing script writers and director. I almost didn't watch this because of their spectacular failing in 500 Days of Summer.It's definitely one of the better and most distinctive teen films of the year. Slightly better than Geography Club, roughly equal to As Cool as I Am, but not quite up to The Truth About Emanuel.",The Spectacular Now
62,dvc5159,Living in the now,7,13 August 2013,"Sutter (Miles Teller) doesn't really face a lot of trouble recently. He's a party-loving, fast-talking clown who lives fast and in the moment, never thinking of the future. After getting dumped due to a misunderstanding, he goes out to get wasted, and finds himself being woken up by Aimee (Shailene Woodley), a regular plain Jane who has nothing really to offer, but with a very bright future ahead of her. Sparks fly, love blossoms and scabs are pulled, slowly.What is remarkable about this familiar coming-of-age tale is that it doesn't pull back any punches. James Ponsoldt's ""The Spectacular Now"" is a raw, brutally honest film about teenage angst and explorations of self-worth. Ponsoldt and his writers (the same guys who wrote ""500 Days of Summer"", here basing off Tim Tharp's novel) purposely avert the generic ""teen movie"" clichés and doesn't rely on melodramatics, all the more transforming the film into a haunting and depressingly realistic exploration of youthful angst and lost chances.Adding to the realism is just how natural the actors and characters are. If there is any indication to the amazing crop of recent young talent that are popping up in Hollywood, then Teller and Woodley would rank among the better ones so far. The duo doesn't just portray the couple as lovelorn teens - they fit the parts and connect so well that you will believe that these are real people we're watching, and not cardboard caricatures you see on the Disney Channel.Sutter lives in the now, but tensions are burning behind Teller's eyes, revealing depths and fears that drive him to do so. Aimee is not a popular girl, but she has a soul, waiting for that special someone, her voice breaking even in hushed tones as she's never felt that way before. Every moment between the duo feels so real and raw that it hurts emotionally when they're hurt. All due praise to Teller and Woodley because both are absolutely terrific in their roles, and a salute to promising careers for both of them.The screenplay is frank, with teenagers talking and acting the way they should in real life, hence the R-rating. I suppose guns, explosions and global destruction are less intense than teenage angst and emotions. No matter. This is a movie that is written and directed with a fiery passion, thanks to Ponsoldt and his crew. Quick-witted, dry humor sprinkle among the more dramatic moments to lend to the rich self- discovering aura of the movie, which lessens as the movie progresses realistically and depressingly to a fitting ending. This is a movie where the quiet moments matter and the emotions boil under the faces, and the audience is too afraid to realize it until it explodes.Because Ponsoldt and his writers love and respect their characters, this emotional burst will put the audience through the wringer at times, while slightly older viewers will feel a burst of nostalgia flowing through them as they recreate their youth through Sutter and Aimee's eyes.Just like adolescence, this is a bittersweet yet honest journey, and I for one am joyed that someone treats their characters and audience with equal amounts of respect and intelligent. The characters in this movie are real and true, and so is the emotional punch. ""The Spectacular Now"" is one of the best films of the year.",The Spectacular Now
63,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Shailene Woodley goes to the prom with John Cusack manqué,5,26 June 2015,"File under ""Coming-of-age drama, well intentioned but disappointing."" Sutter, a brash high-school slacker, gets dumped by his GF, gets drunk and, luckily for him and for us, passes out on Shailene Woodley's lawn. She gives a fine performance as Aimee, a shy, studious manga fan-the kind of girl who gets overlooked in their dull suburban high school but will no doubt blossom in college. Unambitious, live-in-the-moment Sutter just wants to get drunk some more and go on selling bowties in Bob Odenkirk's gents apparel storeNevertheless they become a couple. The leads have decent chemistry, and the courtship scenes are pretty involving, but the writers (""500 Days of Summer"") try to make too much of the psychological backdrop, IMHO. Amy and Sutter are both products of marriages that were destroyed by addiction years earlier. They try to prop each other up, but with only partial success: Amy gets some courage, but Sutter ends up with only half a heart.The dramatic climax seems forced and unconvincing, and after that, the film just limps along toward one of those blackout endings... Hard to say much about Miles Teller's assured performance as Sutter, since his character just seems like a confused sock puppet with the screenwriters' hands up his butt. (A few reviewers have compared him to the John Cusack character in ""Say Anything...,"" but this guy's not even worthy to carry that guy's boombox!) Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kyle Chandler do their best in the confining roles of Sutter's estranged parents, it's always great to see Bob (""Better Call Saul!"") Odenkirk, and Andre Royo's quite good as Sutter's exasperated math teacher.This film got pretty decent reviews (including in the New Yorker and WSJ) and has a 7.2 imdb rating, but after it was over, we were left with that vaguely depressed ""I want the last hour and a half of my life back!"" feeling that so many online reviewers complain about.",The Spectacular Now

But I had the lucky of hearing really good things about this marvelous film named 'The Spetacular Now'. What a great film. Those who likes stories with a great, top notch character development, will love this film just like I do. And it don't stops there. It has a meaningful message, after all, and all the psychological complexities of the protagonist(that some people genuinely hated) is completely understandable. It's a film that works brilliantly if fully understood. There is a long long time that I expected a low budget film to excite me in that way.The acting was very good, and the cinematography isn't at all that bad. For a film with a limited budget, there are some good interesting shots, like the 'room' scene(pay attention of how it looks like a 'home'. Also, the car scenes had really respectable work on it. Back to the acting, Miles Teller was good as the protagonist, he had an incredible charisma necessary for the protagonist role. But the most impressive so far was Shailene Woodley, that was amazing in my opinion, she did with perfection the role of the 'naive' girl.All can I say is don't underestimate this film. Is clear to me that is one of the best American films released in 2013. Looking forward to the next Ponsoldt work, for sure. I think most people will also appreciate the small roles of Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Kyle Chandler. But really, the film would be great even without them.

Having said that, Miles Teller as popular class clown Sutter Keely IS a fairly stock character: A better script for him might have helped.

67,nicolechan916,Awkward pauses with a bland screenplay and average plots.,5,16 June 2014,"I know a lot of people regard this film highly, but I just didn't get what the fuss was all about. Maybe because my teenage years weren't that of a typical American (which is, I'm assuming what this film is about) so maybe that's why I didn't relate to it.Aimee is a shy, reserved girl and the problem I have with her character, is that she changes 360 after meeting Miles. Was it love at first sight or something? If she wasn't doing all those things before, why would she suddenly change?I thought it would be similar to A Walk to Remember, in that the good girl changes the bad boybut it was more of the bad boy changing the shy girl and him growing up. The emphasis on relationships in this film and how teens are so young when they start is slightly disturbing. The influence of society and the media I guess.So I found that this film had a lot of awkward pauses, and awkward exchanges between Sutter and Aimee. They didn't seem to me as a couple in love or finding out about love. I didn't feel the connection between them or why they felt attracted to each other.However the story with Sutter and his parents- especially the scenes with his mother were pretty well done. The acting was pretty good and I did get the sense that it was about a teen finding his way through teen crisis.But as I said, I felt that it was pretty bland.

69,ghost_dog86,A better coming-of-age film.,8,22 August 2013,"I purposefully avoided watching ""21 & Over"" just so I could enjoy Miles Teller's performance in ""The Spectacular Now"". Synopsis: Directed by James Ponsoldt, this film tells the story of Sutter (Miles Teller) a high school senior, who is the consummate ladies' man, arguably the most popular kid in town and the life of every party. But underneath it all, he is flunking out of all of his classes and is basically an alcoholic. You get the picture. Anyway, after a bad breakup coincides with the sudden realization that he might not be graduating, could a chance meeting with a girl (a ""good girl"" type) played by Shailene Woodley, be enough to change Sutter's outlook on his own future? Using the generic ""popular guy falls for the plain Jane"" outline, ""The Spectacular Now"" rises above the formulaic because of its own well constructed Scott Neustadter/Michael H. Weber (500 Days of Summer) script (adapted from a Tim Tharp novel) which contains believable characters, all while developing a journey that isn't nearly as predictable as another coming-of-age movie that came out earlier this summer. Make no mistake, that dig was directed at ""The Way Way Back"". Aided by charming performances from Teller, Woodley, and a very interesting (to say the least) performance from Kyle Chandler, who plays Sutter's estranged father, the characters in this script are allowed to blossom and take on an all too realistic feel. Even if you don't like them, you feel as if you've met these people before. And thus, even if they begin as generic coming-of-age characters, they don't stay that way for long. That was another dig at ""The Way Way Back"" if you hadn't noticed. Final Thought: From time to time, ""The Spectacular Now"" does meander in its dialogue. And it does contain one violently over the top sequence that initially had me in shock, but once I had a chance to take it all in, had me disregarding said sequence as nothing more than an unbelievable plot contrivance. But overall, the fact that this is so unapologetically realistic and the performances/writing is so strong, this is the type of film that will resonate on a deeply emotional level with many audiences; audiences who have been continuing their ongoing quest to find a coming-of-age movie that encompasses that John Hughes magic. And while ""The Spectacular Now"" didn't quite sweep me away into the nostalgic open water like last year's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", this still contains the high level of quality that I expect (but rarely get) out of every coming-of-age movie.

70,danew13,Great Acting in a Decent but Flawed Script,7,22 December 2013,"Don't get me wrong, The Spectacular Now is a good film with a lot of warm innocence and teen angst. The acting from the leads is wonderful. Except you may ask yourself what is the protagonists Sutter's problem with life.So he finds out his long gone father is a bum...big deal.He seems to be popular at school, even though he's carrying a torch for his lost girlfriend. He has a divorced mother but a nice home. He works at a shop and seems a model kid. Yet, he drinks hard booze and beer all the time and isn't very good in his high school studies.Then he meets the ultimate nice virginal girl Aimee and gradually falls for her.Yet, after seeing what a bum his estranged father is, he takes out his anger on his girl. This is where I found the author way off base,having him almost crashing his car and taking out his anger so far that he orders her out of the car on a main street in the middle of nowhere. What kind of animal would do that? Totally out of character.As she steps out of the car she's immediately hit by another car with such speed that you can barely see here being knocked away. She has to a goner, right? No, she is back at school with a sling and no scratches some time later. And still in love with Sutter. After all, he was her first.In a way this film is a bit like Don Jon, a young man finding out about true love and warmth after a superficial relationship.I loved the last scene...you can tell by her look that the power has shifted to her. Will she have him back?",The Spectacular Now
71,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Not so Spectacular as the title suggests.,5,18 December 2013,"I think the film had potential. It had a good premise. And at times the script seemed witty and interesting. (At least whenever it had something to do with Sutter) However, it had a horrible cast. I thought Miles Teller was fantastic. Shailene Woodley...not so much. It absolutely boggles my mind the amount of love she gets from the critics. She's not a great actress. Just an OK one. I also thought Kyle Chandler did really well in a small supporting role. However, 2 great performances do make a great movie.Plus, I just didn't like the character ""Aimee"" either. I didn't feel there was any depth to her. She just seemed like a mindless sheep who would do anything Sutter said. I thought Cassidy, played by Brie Larson had more depth and she had even less screen time. I also didn't really get a sense of WHY she was into Sutter. Was it really just because he was the first boy to pay attention to her? Thats how I felt.I give it 5 stars, mainly because Miles Teller was awesome in it.",The Spectacular Now
72,CleveMan66,"""The Spectacular Now"" is a spectacularly well-made coming-of-age story.",10,2 September 2015,"Coming-of-age movies come in various sizes, shapes and sensibilities. They're usually predictable and often feel contrived. Neither of these is the case with ""The Spectacular Now"" (R, 1:35). Sutter (Miles Teller, in one of his first major roles) is a high school kid who doesn't take anything seriously - not his school work, not his job, not his future, not his relationships with other people, and not even himself. All that changes (gradually) when he becomes friends with the sweet loner Aimee (a pre-""Divergent"" Shailene Woodley). Sutter struggles to get along with the single mother who's raising him (1980s' sweetheart Jennifer Jason Leigh), while wanting to get to know the dad (Kyle Chandler) who left when he was a child.I've seen all four of the actors I just named in other movies, but all four of them showed me something fresh and new in this film and were all more effective than I've ever seen them before. If there were an Oscar for Best Ensemble, I'd say that this cast earned a nomination. As it stands, any one of the cast members is worthy of an individual Oscar nomination, as are screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael W. Weber (adapting Tim Tharp's novel) and the film's director, James Ponsoldt.As Sutter and Aimee's unlikely relationship develops and they each take steps to seize their futures, the plot often appears to be heading in one direction, but then takes you in another. The realism of the performances, the authentic feel of the dialog and the unpredictability of the story combine to make you care deeply about these characters and feel a healthy tension about how things are going to turn out for them. ""The Spectacular Now"" is indeed spectacular and you should see it - now. I give it an ""A+"".",The Spectacular Now
73,santiagocosme,There's nothing spectacular about this movie.,5,23 October 2015,"OK, there is... the title. But that's it. From the reading of the title til' the end of the movie, you will just go through a very average movie, based on a very average script. The story of a young lost man who feels completely uninterested in his future and just wants to live the now. We then realize that his missing father disappeared when he was a kid, and he tries to find him again. Only to discover that his father doesn't give a damn about him (what a surprise). But the important part is really the young man finding love in the most unlikely girl. In fact, she is so different that it's almost impossible to sense any chemistry between them during the movie. But since the director decided they should be together, it is what happens. I don't know, maybe I am too harsh, cause there was an attempt at doing something decent, but I love cinema, and this really left me completely flat.",The Spectacular Now
74,datorsiers2,Live for the future!,6,17 August 2015,"An emotionally grasping movie about two extra-ordinary teenagers, who fall in love. Sutter is a nice guy, who loves everybody and everybody likes him as well. He meets this weird girl Aimee, who changes his view of life, eventually.The main point of the movie is to show young teens and kids, that stagnation and lack of desire to pursue any goals in life is going to lead you to an empty life, where you can only love yourself, since you don't let anybody change your ways. The message is definitely worthy for today's society, since so many people don't know what they really want in life and just sort of give up. It shows, in the movie, that Sutter, eventually, escapes his delusional mindset and tries to move on in life, not saying college is the only way to go, but it certainly is better than drinking beer with some old guys at a pub. Another important thing here is the way Aimee acts, she is completely blinded by love here, Sutter can do anything and she won't even care, since he is her first ever boyfriend and she is happy with the way everything is, although it is not clear what happened in the end, in my opinion, she just forgave him and they moved together, judging by the pattern of her actions, throughout the film.Overall it was not horrible nor excellent, it was just an alright movie to ease through without upsetting your brain. Had a lot of cringe worthy moments and just awkward conversations that were not really played out that well, but well... was still somewhat watchable and interesting.",The Spectacular Now
75,abouhelier-r,The Spectacular Now,9,8 January 2014,"Finally today The Spectacular Now has been released in France, better late than never. I am absolutely mind blown by this film. Obviously I hear a lot of comments, peoples talking and read some reviews, but I'd never thought a film could be so True (with a capital ""T"" please). I was expecting a drama-romantic-thing but THIS. Wow! I wasn't prepared for that at all. Simple but so effective. I left the cinema with such a positive mood. Telling myself that after all I wasn't alone feeling those emotions and questioning myself. This film introduces subjects such as first loves, family relationships, first time, alcohol, studies, jobs, future, and money in such a way that each one of us can perfectly and easily recognisable itself. There are no big deals, no (or not yet) Hollywood super-stars, no wealthy-powerful peoples, no politics. The Spectacular Now focuses on genuine questions and problems of normal day to day teenagers. It deals with the relationships of two main characters. A ""popular"" high school seniors and the not-so-typical ""nice girl"". His philosophy on life changes when he meets her and we can see that through his behaviour's evolution along the film. On the one hand her father passed away and she has dreams like having a house and a dog, marry the man she loves and living happily ever after. On the other hand he's more down to earth in a negative way as he doesn't really see the point to grow up. His father left home when he was a little boy and never came back and his mother is trying to do her best. Living in the now is comfortable for him. Adults struggle to have money, they have to work, have responsibilities and don't seem really opened out in what they do. He is realising that his life at the moment is perfect : a girlfriend who loves him, friends, doing what he wants to do when he wants to do it. But then future. Everyone around him assume to have a plan, and he's even encouraging them to go on this way. Unlike him they already figured out their path. There's a key scene in the film. Firstly he seems totally lost, he's scared of what could happened : leaving home, moving in an other with his girlfriend, in a new town, afraid of failure, letting down people he cares about or hurting them and getting hurt. And suddenly after a car accident he understands that future is relating to challenge and hardship, but stuff always happened. The moral here is that the real challenge in our life, the real hardship is us. Don't focus on things or peoples who do not really matter in your life even if it shut out the pain and everything (good and bad). Living in the now is fine but the best part in this concept is that there is an other one tomorrow, called future, so make it count. I have one word to qualify this film: SIMPLICITY.",The Spectacular Now
76,grnhair2001,The ending ruined it all for me,3,2 April 2014,"I thought the acting was fine to good, and it was an okay teen movie in that unrealistic way we so often see where teens are shown to be precocious philosophers of unerring wisdom, blahblahblah. (How then the movie-going public also accepts that teens grow into guys of their late 20's in movies like Hangover or action flicks, I don't understand. If they're so wise as 16, how do they end up such ****s at 28?) I would have given this film my fallback 5, for didn't hate it and watched to the end, or maybe even a goodwill 6 for a smattering of good moments, but then I did watch to the end and there's the awful ending, which halves the score. SPOILERS follow.Here's the future of the lead character, were he real. Either he becomes a carbon copy of his father (who probably actually did ""have a heart,"" despite what the bitter ex says, before his addiction stole it away), or he tries rehab and AA about 5-10 times before it finally takes in his 40's after booze has ruined his and other lives, or he dies in a car crash or kills a family of six in a car crash and gets jailed. If he has turned this girl into another alcoholic, she might have a chance of living a good life--even without rehab--if she goes about ending her drug use quickly now, and stays far, far away from him. So the pusher of the drug following the innocent he corrupted many miles to continue to corrupt her is not a happy ending. It's a terrifying ending and should have had different music and editing to convey that. One pretend epiphany, a hug from mommy, and some backspacing on a keyboard does not change a serious, long-term addict's life, no way, no how.You can't claim to make a movie with great insight and have zero insight into addiction and win me over. If the filmmakers caved to some idiotic focus group to end it like this, shame on them. If they just don't get the topic of addiction, they should have researched it. Whyever they failed, they did fail.",The Spectacular Now
77,FilmMuscle,A Traditional and Predictable Coming-of-Age Story,6,7 September 2013,"Just when Hollywood is buzzing after a coming-of-age film's release, yet another one opens at a local movie theater. It seems as if this particular kind of story is immune to negative opinions because The Spectacular Now has been awarded a tremendous 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. Hmm, there must be something truly great about the film, right? Critics have been consistently praising its thematic material and, again, its coming-of-age nature. Now, first of all, I'm here to refute all that acclaim. I might be buzzkill, but I just have to point out the clear flaws of the film from an unbiased perspective. Before we begin, The Spectacular Now is essentially a love story between two polar opposites- a party animal with drinking issues and a timid, selfless girl. Their journey of a relationship commences once Sutter (played by Miles Teller) finds himself lying on someone's front yard when he's thankfully woken up by Aimee (Shailene Woodley), and that's where it all begins. For now, let's keep everything optimistic and positive by pointing out several strong performances from the likes of Kyle Chandler to Miles Teller. In my opinion, Miles Teller embodies a fascinating character who's riddled with countless problems, and though he seems totally fine from the outside, it's the inside that's eating him up as he continues to struggle with his inner self. Though he appears to be a complete douchebag at first, he understands it as well as you do, which obviously creates much more sympathy for his complex character. At this point, Miles Teller has been in a few party comedies already, and so, he already knows how to play that kind of character. In short, he's entirely convincing as one of the school's popular, obnoxious kids. However, though the film has its fair share of terrific actors, it still suffers from a mediocre script, and I mean ""mediocre"" in the most genuine way possible. You know what the opposite of ""genuine"" is? This film or, at least, its rough start. What you witness is plentiful of cheesy dialogue between its two characters so much so that a whole new level of superficiality is introduced. Nothing about these two characters feels natural as they spuriously laugh and comment in the most stereotypical fashion. Honestly, I usually tend to dislike films centered around teenagers because I often struggle with relating to the characters or simply just liking the characters. Even though Aimee is introduced as the almost-innocent and kind girl, she grows fond of Sutter's lifestyle and chooses to participate in it as if the film is telling you that this is surely right. Of course, I can't get into spoilers, and that really sucks because I can't delve into the meat of the film, but I guess I'll have to work with what I can. Aside from its characters and faulty writing, the themes present in the film have been done time and time again. Alcoholism issues? Check. Family issues? Check. Two unlikely compatible characters actually falling in love with each other? Check, check, check. I absolutely love how some critics love to pan certain films for their predictability- their predictable endings and predicable structures- but yet this film is a significant representation of a predictable story. It follows along in a fairly traditional manner, and just when something unexpected transpires, it only slightly affects the total world. Even though something incredibly painful occurs to one of the characters, they turn out fully fine after a matter of scenes. The ending is also extremely predictable and ends exactly the way you thought it would end from the very beginning. After an undeniably touching scene presents itself, an anti-climatic scene only follows a few seconds later. Albeit the typical themes, there's that one arc again where Sutter persists in questioning his place as a human being and the damage that he's clearly causing to the people around him- that is what I found engaging and saddening. If only the film would explore more unconventional and atypical themes and concepts, then it would've delivered a far more memorable experience. To make things clearer, I did not say I ever disliked Sutter's character because he really was a fresh person- an anti-hero, so to speak. It's the stories about unbelievably flawed individuals that always fascinate me more over a generic ""goody-two-shoes"" hero. His inability of moving on with his life and indecisive attitude are further resonant aspects of the film's layered design. With all that being said, The Spectacular Now isn't the ""spectacular"" film critics are leading you to believe because it does suffer from overly familiar themes and plot points, predictability, and unsatifisying dialogue. If you're prepared for another coming-of-age story, you could try it out, but it's definitely nothing to write home about and applaud left and right.",The Spectacular Now

I mean, with the sun burnt skin, freckles on her face, a little fatty, and those worn out outfits, I have to say she almost looks ugly and unattractive. So convincing.The movie's kind of similar with The Fault In Our Stars, especially the male cast. Mmm, the female cast too actually. And so with the story. But I enjoyed it. It's good. I always love the movie that teach me lessons.Here the second time I saw Shailene naked but not so naked like in White Bird In A Blizzard. Till now I still wonder how she could be so brave. Like she beats Jennifer Lawrence many times in this matter. But of course Shailene is so talented as well. She's so natural. Only sometimes her frequent giggle here annoys me.At first I didn't really like the face of the male cast. I think he's not handsome enough to play the role of a so cool person. But along with time, I like him. He's good and makes the character more interesting and convincing. And Brie Larson? Why sometimes she looks like an old woman here? The way she dress.

79,tbmforclasstsar,"a beautiful, genre-defining, genuine feature that may change the face of high school films forever",10,3 May 2013,"It is really interesting to look at the history of high school movies in cinema. The 80s and early 90s gave us Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Dazed and Confused,Ferris Bueller's Day Off and the John Hughes classics like 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club; films that dove into the sexuality, partying, and innocence of high school. The late 90s and early 2000s brought on a wave of high school rom/com films like 10 Things I Hate About You,Clueless, American Pie, Drive Me Crazy, Can't Hardly Wait, and She's All That, comedies that focused on the romance aspects of high school,specifically dating and prom. The later 2000s changed again with Napoleon Dynamite, Juno, Superbad, Easy A, and Mean Girls, films that showed a much quirkier comedy side of high school and focused more on popularity and the fears and consequences of bullying.And with the past few years that have gone by, I feel as if the design of a good high school film has once again shifted. Sure, we still see films like Prom, Project X, and 21 Jump Street that fit past high school forms, but I feel the focus on a lot of new films seems to be moving towards an authentic representation of the high school experience. While the crazy parties, overly sexualized youths, and Cinderella-esque romance stories interested audiences for years, filmmakers seem to be moving in a direction of creating real, genuine characters for the audience to fall in love with. We saw this last year with The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a film that is full of quirk, romance, and youth drama, but created honest characters and a very realistic story.Even more authentic than The Perks of Being a Wallflower (to the point that Perks looks hokey) comes James Ponsoldt's (Off the Black, Smashed) third feature film, The Spectacular Now. The film follows the life of Sutter (Miles Teller), a very popular and loved member of a high school senior class that struggles with the reality of his high school years coming to an end. While Sutter may be the life of the party and a charismatic and fun person to be around, most of his classmates see him as nothing more than a out-going buddy at social events that isn't going anywhere in life. When his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson) breaks it off with him, Sutter turns to a night of drinking that ends with him passed out on the grass.Enter Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who wakes Sutter up on her front lawn on her way to delivering papers on her mother's paper route. Sutter joins Aimee on the news delivery ride and finds that she is incredibly easy to get along with and could be someone he might have a good time hanging out with. He invites Aimee to a party later that day and before you know it, a relationship is formed. Full of high school innocence and a strong chemistry, Sutter and Aimee make a great couple that is easy for the audience to quickly fall in love with.But Sutter's life is consistently eating away at him. Constantly drinking booze, whether it be at school or on the job (alcoholism being nothing foreign to a James Ponsoldt film) and wishing to meet his father that had separated with his mother when he was young, Sutter's relationship with Aimee is the one thing that makes him happy day to day. Even when his friend questions why he would be dating her, Sutter knows that there is a connection with Aimee that keeps him loving life and living in the moment; away from the oncoming train of graduation. But is the relationship the couple has strong enough to keep Sutter away from his internal struggles and is Sutter willing to let Aimee come along for the ride?

This is the opposite from those over-the-top sex comedies surrounding high school graduation. This film paints a much more accurate picture, focusing in on a relationship that is formed between two opposite people. It's dramatic and romantic without ever falling into fantasy, there's a very real sense it could all end at any moment. It's sweet without being too cute for comfort and it never loses it's entertainment value.

82,JackCerf,Surprisingly Spiritual,8,20 September 2013,"American movies rarely get religion right; The Apostle is one of the few I can think of that sympathetically understands an evangelical Christian. The Spectacular Now, without ever being explicit, lays out the best case I have seen for a character having a conversion experience. Sutter Keeley is bright, emotionally perceptive, and without malice towards anyone. He is also destroying himself with self-loathing, and he is in desperate need of an ideal father to replace his real one, who is first absent and then, when he appears, a model of everything Sutter fears and loathes about himself. The situation cries out for a road to Damascus moment, and I left hoping that the kid got it. If he does, his talents give him a future as a salesman, a preacher, or even a small town politician.Amy Finicky is another story. She has spent all of high school with her head down, grinding away for the grades that will get her out of town and away from her mother. Having gotten the scholarship to her chosen college, she has won the race and has nothing left to do in her last semester of high school. Though she doesn't realize it, she is ready for a victory lap, and Sutter is just what she needs as preparation for the wider world she's about to enter. Sutter will be a bittersweet memory, but she's outgrown him once she gets on the bus out of town. She doesn't know it; he does.The last shot, where Sutter turns up at Amy's college, is deliberately ambiguous.

83,YJLcool,The best coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film of 2013,9,28 December 2013,"Last year, we have the spectacular Perks of Being of Wallflower. This  year, we have The Way, Way Back and most of all, The Spectacular Now.  It is a lovely, heartfelt, sweet, gentle and sincere film. The  Spectacular Now focuses on most teen experiences: first love  relationship, 'living in the now' attitude towards life, fear of the  future, alcohol and family issues.  The story is about a charming, crude but troubled boy meets a reserved,  shy, naive...yet sweet, smart girl/wallflower and managed to find a  connection in each other. As the film progresses, it was shown that  they enjoy hanging out together, helping and complementing each other.   Sutter, the lead guy, plagued by alcoholism and family issues, must  learn to confront his fears and face who he really is and learn what  loving someone really means. Aimee, the lead girl, need to learn to  stand up for herself against her controlling mother who might be  potentially ruining her college future because she's responsible for  partially paying the bills. The film may seem to be an average love  story, but it carries a genuine believability to it.   The film takes the first-love romance seriously but never falls to  become the typical weepy Asian melodramas that Koreans are so fond of  making. The two lead actors are great on screen, deliver strong  convincing performance to let us believe that the love chemistry  between them is real and managed keep the audience engaged throughout  the film. There are some subtle humor throughout the film as well.  What a deeply affecting film this is. It's the best coming-of-age  romantic drama comedy film of the year.   Rating: 9/10  ""But the real challenge in my life, the real hardship, is me. It's  always been me. As long as I can remember, I've never not been afraid.  Afraid of failure. Of letting people down.

84,quiqueperezsoler,An uplifting tale of a teenager that finds in a girl a reason to find and be himself. More of a grounded teen drama than a romantic story,8,9 May 2021,"I love this movie. So many great themes and messages. From living the ""now"" by looking around on your last year of High School to soak in what most consider the ""best years of your life"" before becoming an adult; to finding someone as broken as you and not particularly ""your type"", finding in them the courage to be one's self. It is real, cinematographically surprisingly astounding and with top notch performances with a story as relatable and authentic as the characters' interactions.I was even surprised to see the romance is but the igniter of the character's evolution throughout it and not the central plot. And I understand the reticence of people who expected more of a romantic ""comedy/drama"" and instead were treated with a very straight forward, conversation-heavy teen drama (The trailers really only do half the job when conveying the tone of the movie). Never have ordinary conversations engaged me so much in caring about the characters. To feel like I'm watching real people. And it's all thanks to the performances of the two main leads and the impeccable script.This movie follows along the lines of ""Lady Bird""(2017) and even ""Perks of being a Wallflower""(2012) where the movie focuses more on showing real teen struggles while balancing up the darker moments with real happy ones through the romance and friendship. And the way these movies do so feel natural and less flashy than other more edgy, angsty and lighthearted/comedic teen movies.While some of the plot structure, characters and messages may appear cliche they are told in such a refreshing new way that they are welcomed and grounding. Having these elements serve the story or a character's journey to me it's worth including every time no matter how overused. Sure, Shailene Woodley is WAY too beautiful an actress to play the ""I never had a boyfriend because I'm not pretty""-role, if the reason was because she was too shy, kept to herself or simply uninterested I'd buy it; but the fact is that she never said she didn't wanted a boyfriend or wasn't interested in one so I feel the lack of character development on her half is what brings down the movie for me. I understand the important story and character in the movie is the guy, but by ""dismissing"" Shailene's character in some of her core moments leaves out half of our understanding of her character choices.We see she has a hard relationship with her mom yet we never really see her in the movie, nor do we know or see why she'd be so forgiving of someone as broken as the main protagonist when we haven't seen her interact with other broken people. Is not that it'd be out of character, is just that because we don't really know her that well, her forgiving attitude towards the many mistakes the main character makes that hurt her comes accross as a bit unexpected. For instance, we never see a scene of her confronting him about the ""real reason"" for him to go out with her, a scene that perhaps would naturally be placed after the car accident. We are lead to believe (through the guy's conversation with his friend throughout the movie) that she isn't ""as important"" to him or he's ""not interested"" in her that way, while getting over his ex by using her at the very beginning of the movie. Sure, his intentions were to help her out while hurting for his broken heart but the movie lead us to believe he was sort of using her. So when they have the fight in the car, after visiting his dad, and the ""truth"" comes out, she doesn't seem as pissed. Even though he was the reason she got run over. Sure, he was in distress and turns out to be a pretty broken kid, and he apologized, but her quickness to forgive him felt a bit rushed and lacking a better confrontation between these two.Couples fight, especially when they have confronting views about things, like the future, another big theme of the movie. The Spectacular ""NOW"", referencing the most teen coming-of-age theme of enjoying every second of your youth. I know the main character's whole deal is that he represses most of who he is or what he feels by putting up a facade of happy jokey guy, and I love that about the outcome of his character at the end. But still, I guess I just felt like I needed more of the girl's view or her life and personality to see how well they would fit. In some scenes she feels like she is just tagging along, just there to help the main character instead of providing a different opinion or point of view in the matter.Nevertheless, I don't want to seem like I don't like this movie because I really do. Perhaps it was for the mindset I watched it in, not expecting yet another teen drama with romantic plot that would depress me a bit regardless of how fantastic the movie would be; and instead I found a quite uplifting message and takeaway to it.I am happy to have found comfort in the message that some people who are broken can still find ""salvation"" by meeting someone, whether a partner or a friend, and find themselves before they throw their lives away. Showing who they trully are to the world without worrying about what people thought. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs this kind of message and again, this is the takeaway I personally get from the movie. Perhaps it's not what others may want to get out of it but it's what I got.",The Spectacular Now

87,fluturoj,Youngsters-targeted,4,22 July 2016,"It's maybe because I am slightly older than the targeted audience but I found the movie not be so interesting or adding something that not most people know. The real-life link: the movie very clearly tries to send out the message that living only in the present is not the smartest thing to do and that the future matters as well. Surprise, surprise. However, I have to admit that probably there are a lot of people with the same mind set as Sutter thinking that only now matters but as it can be seen from the movie, you can't live in the now if everyone else is moving to the future. It is people that make up your 'now', if they are gone so is 'now' as well. Without people the 'now' is just a geographical place where you find yourself stuck. While I think that this message should have been the highlighting point of the movie, the movie goes on in the end and highlights Sutter's fear of failure, disappointing others and putting up walls as the main reason for his problems. We never saw this in the movie. On the country Sutter was the opposite of that. Character analysis: while the movie wants us to believe that Sutter's character that we saw in the movie was a fake and in the reality he was not the easy going guy just someone who was afraid to let other down and fail and so put walls by focusing on others rather than himself leading him to stop feeling, is something I strongly disagree. Or at least the movie failed to put forward. Sutter pretending or not he never stopped caring about others. He does have a big heart. He is even ready to sacrifice his relationship with Aimee because he wanted to protect her and believed she was better off without him. That is not putting up a wall on your feelings, that's the opposite of that. That's feeling. He wanted to hold on to now but realised that is not possible and that he will eventually end up as his dad if he keeps doing that. Thats when he had to deal with the newly discovered truth, accept it and move on. Thats his story. The end with fail to disappoint or fail, they don't fit in this story, they make the character ambiguous and weaken it. Thats something the movie got wrong. What I liked about the movie however, is that it has a positive note. It's not a typical high school movie where there are the bad guys and the good ones, those who hurt and those who get hurt. Characters in the movie are more mature. Aimee, for example, is not the typical jealous girlfriend when she catches Sutter looking at Cassidy while she was dancing. Or even Cassidy and Sutter being friendly exes is just not typical for high school exes or Marcus taking Sutter's advice and even asking for it. I like this positive note and this is how things are (or at least should be) when you are a mature grown up maybe in your 30s but lets be honest no teen behaves like that. Another thing the movie got wrong. Overall, characters are not well developed, story does not apply to typical teens ( and hence probably a lot can not relate) but it has a positive note that would make your mood.",The Spectacular Now

My second time watching it I said to myself ""how is this not my favorite romance movie?"" After about 30-45 mins in though it just gets worse and worse. It's more of a super realistic romance, than fairytale ones that are in most romantic movies. Towards the end it also starts to stray away from their love story and turns into a characters battle with themself. Almost like an entire different movie. I just kept losing the spark and interest as the movie went on. I'd say it's a movie about a high schoolers struggles with life more than a romance film.",The Spectacular Now

90,jmc4769,Awkwardness doesn't necessarily equal reality,6,24 August 2013,"I live in Athens, Georgia, the location where this movie was filmed and the hometown of the director, James Ponsoldt. I loved Ponsoldt's previous movie, Smashed, which by the way featured a stunning performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who plays Sutter's sister in this movie. So I really, really wanted to like Spectacular Now.But what a huge disappointment. Sometimes when I watch a movie, I know in the first five minutes that I'm not going to like it. This was unfortunately one of those movies. My biggest problem was the awkward, underwritten dialog. Some scenes were almost painful to watch. I know that the awkwardness was supposed to make the movie more realistic. But if there are teenagers that talk like this, I've never known any. The dialog here, especially in some scenes, is more like improvisation than reality.My other problem is that we are initially led to believe Aimee is a serious, bookish, ""good"" kid. But the way the story develops and the way Shailene Woodley plays the part, Aimee comes across as shallow, giggly, gullible, and immature, not to mention lacking in character. Having never taken a drink of alcohol, once she falls under Sutter's spell, she zips right on past beer and goes straight to regularly drinking the hard stuff without giving it a second thought, as if she's never even heard the word responsibility. Sure there are plenty of teens like Aimee, and Woodley does a good job of portraying her. But we see enough of teens like this in commercial Hollywood movies. I was hoping for a more interesting character in this independent film.",The Spectacular Now
91,seronjaa-797-313124,Poor story and poor characters in a chocolate coating,6,11 July 2016,"The actors are good. So is the music, the dialogue, all the scenes are nicely wrapped and look very good. But if you think a little about the story and the characters, you will realize that the movie really isn't any better, than the average teenage drama or romance. I actually liked the main character- he's real. He's a selfish lazy coward. A young guy, who wants to have fun with girls and life. He's not very deep, but he thinks he is and the writers are trying to convince us, that he is. He makes some terrible mistakes in that movie and just gets away with them. So I guess, most teenagers are like that- they don't think about their actions, they hurt themselves and other people and don't know what to do with their lives. At least, we get to know this character, unlike his girlfriend. Seh's just a cliché of an innocent nice nerdy girl. Of course she reads comics and of course, he is the center of her world. I would have loved to see some other dimensions in this girl, like some weird habits, wishes, thoughts. Anything. I mean, she doesn't even dance and she apologizes all the time! It's horrible. She doesn't get mad, when he dances with her ex, she doesn't get mad, when he throws her out of the car and she gets in the hospital! She's a doormat. She's that kind of girl, that would get beaten by her boyfriend and appologize afterwards for getting beaten. The movie really had some potential, but it all went downhill. At least they speared us of the unnecessary cliché, that I expected to happen- Sutter getting back to his ex and Aimee crying about it. Even though I think he would have done it, if his ex would let him. If you want to watch some good teenage romance movies, watch ""Keith"" or my all time favourite ""Teenage dirtbag"".",The Spectacular Now
92,archiecm,"It was good cinema but I don't agree about the ""love"" and ""beauty""",8,19 October 2014,"It was hard to watch this film which, in this case , doesn't mean it was a bad film . . . simply that the issues raised were similar to mine in my childhood and in my life. I rented it and had to stop it about four times before I got through it and that took about three days. Sutter was in so much pain that he numbed himself constantly. I was like that but not quite as bad. He couldn't face his pain. Sure he was friendly and funny but the alcohol helped him be that way. Underneath he believed he was worthless. So his ""romance"" with Aimee isn't beautiful at all. He was being nice to her out of loneliness and perhaps because he was kind-hearted but it didn't ring true that he was falling in love or that his motives were pure. I don't think he actually liked her for who she was. She was more like a hobby. His self-esteem was so low he was incapable of love anyway. He felt like a failure and so how could he respect anyone who would ""fall"" for a failure. He says as much on his drive back from his visit to see his Dad. ""You don't love me,"" he says. It's a hard scene to watch. Then he graduates somehow but keeps drinking. And he quits his job because he knows he isn't ever going to stop drinking and will therefore let his boss down eventually. This is the films low point. We don't see it but he dumps Aimee at this point. Throughout this period I keep stopping the film and switching to the telly. ""Legends"", and college football, PGA tournament in Vegas, all served to buy me time to prepare for the ending. What would it be? The answer is that he cracks up enough to alert his Mom to what's happening. And he opens up to her about his inner chaos and she gives him empathy and love. And from that he begins to heal. He applies to college (something he had no interest in doing up 'till now). The ending was nice but I had to watch it twice to get it. The reason I liked it was because Aimee is coming out of class, college class, and obviously hasn't seen Sutter in months. But this is the new Sutter, the one who's going to work on himself and the one who now has something to offer. He's now the Sutter who can actually accept the love of someone else. But Aimee doesn't fly into his arms. Her face is the magic that you see in real life but not that often in film. There's disbelief at first, then a nervous smile of recognition, then a remembrance of the pain seems to flash across her face . . . kind of a frown, followed by a look of simple curiosity. When I watched this the second time I got it: she was going to talk to Sutter and see if he had something different. It was the look of, ""OK, I'll listen to what you've brought today . . . . and see if it's different enough to rekindle the warmth I used to have for you."" That's how I took it. And I guessed he had a chance of winning her back. I hope he succeeded.",The Spectacular Now

96,MovieHead123,Very realistic,7,22 July 2018,"I really like this movie, not because it's some great love story. Because come to think of it, it isn't really a love story. Sutter is in love with his ex, Cassidy throughout the whole film. I like the movie because it is raw and just REAL.Sutter is a fun guy who lives in the moment. He doesn't worry about the future or about consequences (just like most adolescents). With graduation and adulthood approaching, Cassidy breaks up with Sutter because she wants a future. All in all, she wants someone who takes life seriously - Something Sutter refuses to do. He's a likeable guy, very easy going, which makes getting over him that much harder. But still, she moves on. Sutter then meets Aimee who is a very sweet girl with a good head on her shoulders. Her and Sutter get along very well. They soon open up to each other, and she ends up losing her virginity to him. Still... Sutter is hung up on his ex, which is what bothered me about the film. However, it gives the story and the viewer a sense of realism. The reason why Aimee is so important and a big part of the plot is because she's the reason as to why Sutter finally faces his demons, and not once does she give up on him, not even when he tries pushing her away. She's very forgiving, understanding, compassionate, and loving. She's exactly what Sutter needs. I can see how some people don't like this movie. I disagree, but I understand why. It's not your typical romance, like The Notebook, A Walk To Remember, or The Vow to name a few.

98,Dfschohr-532-549658,The Spectacular Now Review,9,22 October 2013,"When it comes down to teen angst, if its done well, I have an extreme soft spot. The Spectacular Now soars above all expectations, and shows us some real eighteen year olds, with real problems. Yes this film hits some typical high school moments, buts its delivered with strong performances from the whole young cast. Sutter (Miles Teller) has just been dumped by his girlfriend, according to him they were the perfect popular couple. They both like to drink and be the life of the party, but Sutter's drinking follows him around from school to work. After losing his car one night, a drunken Sutter awakens in the front yard of his high school classmate Aimee, who is the loner wallflower. Aimee and Sutter are inseparable from that moment on, although Sutter still lingers on his ex.Miles Teller, I can tell will have an exceptional career ahead of him, along the lines of a young Joesph Gordon Levitt. The character of Sutter reminded me a lot of myself, not the alcoholic part, but his whole view on life, and living in the now and not letting the little things affect you. In Sutter's case it works for him, but being to carefree contributes to some of the problems in his life. Shailene Woodley is progressively growing as an actress. If she can just get off that terrible ABCfamily show and stick to these independent roles, she'll go far. I was first introduced to Woodley in The Descendants, where she holds her own up against the heavy weight that is Clooney. Watching both of these films you can see how diverse of an actress Woodley can be in playing two different eighteen year olds.The rest of the supporting cast doesn't fall short, with Brie Larson as the ex girlfriend, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Sutter's Mom, and can't forget Kyler Chandler's outstanding subtle performance. This is my first film from director James Ponsoldt, but im looking forward to seeing his previous film Smashed with Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul. The writing team of Scott Neustadter and Mitchell H. Weber have excelled with their last two projects. Lets hope their next one The Faults In The Stars will be just as good. I give The Spectacular Now a 9 out of 10.",The Spectacular Now
99,Nothinggrandproductions,"Amazing, realistic performances but still doesn't do much to change the genre",7,15 September 2013,"The Spectacular Now is an interesting film due to the fact that it displays modern teenage culture in a sincere way and doesn't belittle them. It tries to stay grounded in realism as much as it can and give a true and realistic approach to it's storytelling. The movie follows Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) who is a high school senior without much real ambition and just loves to live in the ""Now."" He has recently broken up with his girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson) but he's trying as much as possible to not let him bother him. Sutter is also essentially an alcoholic and one morning wakes up on the lawn of Aimee Finecky's (Shailene Woodley) home. They quickly become friends and a bit more so. Aimee is a bit more of nice girl, has plans for the future, and has never had a boyfriend. These two contrast each other but they build upon each other as well. The best part of this entire film is the performances. Both leads are unbelievably natural in the way they portray their characters. It never feels forced and always feels real which I loved. There is also a constant amount of long takes where the actors just keep a really long scene going and makes it feel even more natural due to that. That doesn't mean it still doesn't fall into the occasional stereotypical coming of age tropes. Or that the movie never really covers much new territory. It doesn't really change or impact the genre very much. But, very few films have done much new with the genre in a long time and neither does this one for the most part besides the fact that the performances feel so real. It isn't an awful film by any means, it just does very little to differentiate itself besides some stylistic choices and performances. On top of that, some of the plot choices are questionable towards the end and felt a bit strange. Regardless, this is one of the better films to display teenagers on screen and make it feel natural and less forced. I can't say for sure to go see this one in the theater but it is still worth a watch at some point.",The Spectacular Now
100,dsa_ca,High school trappings,8,2 September 2013,"Aimee Finicky could be that girl/boy in school who focuses on their academic and always tries to make way for their future.It is a dream for Amiee(a girl) to have Sutter, an outgoing party hopping high school charmer, showing interest in her. Her dream may seem like a nightmare for many in the audience. Going literally through physical pain and emotional trauma and disappointment, one really wishes having an intervention for her. Because by viewing through any vantage point, this relation if just started at the end the movie 'The Spectacular Now', seems only destined to be turbulent.These flawed but deeply lovable and real characters, such as Aimee and Sutter, are the ones that are responsible for the positive reaction to 'The Spectacular Now' at the yearly festival circuit grind that an independent movie goes through. Among the audience for an early screening of the movie there were more than a few disgruntled audience members.Adapted from a novel with the same name, the movie is filled with overwhelming genuine teen romance moments. It is also pleads innocence for the decisions made by its teen adult leads that makes the movie hop off through their times during the final year of school.Broken up recently from his longtime high school sweet heart Cassidy (played by Brie Larson); Mr. Keely may be on a high school rebound. Sutter Keely's life takes a turn for the tragic for his spectacular now lifestyle when drunken and passed out he meets Aimee, on a neighborhood front lawn the morning after he discovers Cassidy dating with school Footballer Marcus.Aimee being mostly an unknown entity for her entire school life appears gullible to Sutter's boyish charm. Her attraction to Sutter comes at a cost of her only friend Kristal, a friendship that heavily relies on Aimee being a pushover.As Sutter's influence on Aimee increases, he gets her to start drinking and prods her to take a stand against her mother, who uses Aimee to get away from her daily early morning paper delivery profession. Aimee overwhelmed by the life changing experience and relationship decides to commit to Sutter even further their High School arrangement.Her request for Sutter to consider moving with her to Philadelphia for further studies shows off her growing confidence within her and in the relationship. While Sutter quietly makes the transition of being tamed into have deep affections for a person of opposite sex.On Aimee's insistence Sutter confronts his mother and sister to provide contact of his abandoned from childhood father. The long awaited visit to his father's place provides Sutter a vision for the future to his own 'spectacular now' life agenda. With his father spouting the very same banality of living the life now; Sutter realizes where his life might be heading towards.Aimee's love and affection towards Sutter after the anti-climactic Father-Son re-union finally breaks the bubble for Sutter to make him realize that it is time to embrace adulthood.Mr. Ponsoldt's primary skills seem to be depiction of alcoholism and it consequence after last year's 'Smashed' and 'The Spectacular Now'. Sutter's short interaction with his father and realization that his father's alcoholism is a cautionary tale for him brings out the best out of the director.Additionally, the romance and its poignant and touching moments is where Mr. Ponsoldt triumphs over the novel. The novel by Mr. Tharp sketches far more complex and real characters and brings out an emotionally numbing end to Sutter's spectacular now theory. But Mr. Ponsoldt gives us a slice of high school romance that rarely looks so truthful in cinemas.Although the movie's ending is a far cry from the novel's numbing vision, Mr. Ponsoldt's version of the end is edgier enough for a Hollywood film which brings out the best from it talented young leads Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley.Though the romantic leads hog the movie, a shout out has to be given to Brie Larson for her role of Cassidy, a character which makes all the right choices in life for herself. Brie Larson makes sure her character does not devolves into a snippy popular high school girl.'The Spectacular Now' avoids being a Hollywood Rom-com and is a welcome addition to the coming-of-age genre that always has a new tale to narrate.",The Spectacular Now
101,Serge_Zehnder,"A movie about adults, no matter their age",9,25 December 2014,"The word teen"" is used in copious ways to describe this movie. And as much as it has its place when it comes to defining the main characters, at the end of it I felt as if I've watched a tremendously adult love story. One about care, about doubt, about overwhelming feelings, about responsibility, about basically all the things that a young person should not necessarily burden him- or herself with.The two leads, Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, carve out a spot in their careers with this film. I heartily believe that in the years to come more than enough people will associate these two with the characters (Sutter and Amy) that they've portrayed here. The late Roger Ebert equaled Miles Teller's qualities in this picture to the ones of John Cusack in and around the time of Say Anything"". And yes, if you've cherished Cameron Crowe's directorial debut you will find yourself wrapped up in this tale. Both movies take their characters seriously and show them within a real context. A life around people who are all trying to keep things afloat. Which takes me back to the adult love story"". Disillusion leads to keeping your emotions under wraps. The love that exists in the spectacular now is the one you let blossom devoid of any intellectual basis. Which makes it the purest, most necessary and mature way of falling in love. Since it goes against the grain of reason, which is where most people beyond their teenage years try to live and very often fail. It may be called mature or adult to love with your intellect, but as Sutter observes so astutely: I don't see what's so great about being an adult."" One of the answers to that could be, that as an adult you allow yourself to be a teenager with the clarity and calm of experience. Which is what Shailene Woodleys character might represent. The person who awaits her equal, to share in all the moments of wonder and compromise amidst the ever changing colors of a relationship.",The Spectacular Now
102,rsj624,Spectacular How?,8,26 April 2014,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Perhaps it's all too often that a coming of age film is released; but it never seems far from appreciated when one worth watching comes along to remind us of growing up, and how our own feelings and experiences figuring out our place in this world helped to shape us as adults. For what it's worth The Spectacular Now is not a bad movie, but it fails more often than not to invoke those very feelings, and is not as great a watch as one may be lead to believe.You begin by entering into the life of Sutter Keely, a young man growing up with all the friends and all the fun in the world he needs. With no concerns about the future, you're tasked with buying into his character and watching the most important moments of his life unfold and help lead him to a better life thanks to finding a real love and grizzly reconnecting with a long absent family member. Problem here is that Miles Teller does not have the charm needed to pull off such a character as Sutter Keely,and considering he's closer to 30 in real life than he is to 20 it becomes even more difficult suspend disbelief. He sounds just like a much less humorous Jonah Hill, and is no where's near as funny. Now this isn't to say that he doesn't bring anything to the table, as he can stand toe to toe with all his fellow actors, but he just seems miscast and his talent squandered on a role he should've passed over. I feel I will enjoy him in future endeavors, but nothing felt genuine about him in this film. Shailene Woodley also feels miscast, and given her recent surge as Hollywood's 'it' girl, it's hard to buy into her being a plain Jane outcast of sorts. It's easy to see that both parties involved are testing the waters of their acting depth and how far they can stray from type; however, they feel weird in this world, and not solid fit for each other. Their acting is top notch, just not really enjoyable. Again, the story is not a bad one; it just ends up feeling very 'been there done that' after viewing. It's hard to give a film like this one a bad score just because it isn't a bad film, but to recommend it for reasons other than just being able to say you've seen it is a hard thing for me to do. It's a disappointment, as I expected something much more than what I feel has been told so many times already, but if you have nothing better to do and you have 90 minutes to waste, this isn't a bad movie albeit more forgettable than not.",The Spectacular Now
103,britishdominion,"A Gentle, Almost Say Anything",6,21 August 2013,"Sundance-darling ""The Spectacular Now"" is a curious one. With a script by the guys who wrote ""500 Days of Summer"", the movie is about as slice- of-life as they come, and it is interesting and well-acted. As the film unspools, it may subconsciously remind viewers of the imperfect messiness of Cameron Crowe's teen ode ""Say Anything"" - complete with a Cusack-like performance by Miles Teller. Teller's Sutter character is smooth, confident, charming, occasionally- unlikable and flawed. It's an accomplished balancing act. The centerpiece performance is really Shailene Woodley, as Sutter's new girlfriend Aimee. She gives the most natural performance of a teenager on screen in ages. Her unaffected, open assignment elevates every scene she's in. Both performances are in service of a film that drifts through the senior high students' last weeks before the end of high school, and takes a mutedly-pessimistic approach of the future before our two leads. These two kids are invisibly shackled to their town, in their home life, their pasts. Echoing the crux at the centre of 1989's ""Say Anything"", Aimee figures an escape plan; Sutter seems to be blindly comfortable in his 'spectacular' now.Pulling ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" alum Jennifer Jason-Leigh into the film as Sutter's world-worn mother was a nice touch. Her vacant-eyed mother is in keeping with the film's less-glamorous take.The picture labours a bit too much in over-emphasizing Sutter's crutch, and the mid-film scenes visiting Sutter's estranged father had trouble finding the right tone between character and caricature. The movie doesn't feel any urgency to build to a conclusion, but when it does, it is understated, uneventful - kind of like our two characters, and sort of like real-life, too.Life is messy, as is ""The Spectacular Now"". It eschews the studio slickness and over-plotted determination of more polished teenage products. Despite two grounded, award-worthy lead performances, this film seemed a touch sketched and ever-so-slightly inert.",The Spectacular Now

She's not just the girl who likes science fiction, or the perfect student, or the complete underdog and he is not the perfect good looking guy that has everything.

107,naregian,Truly spectacular,9,24 June 2013,"I am so glad I caught a screening of this film because I will definitely be seeing it again after it's wide release.From the writers of 500 Days of Summer, which we all know wasn't just your average love story, comes a seemingly average love story in The Spectacular Now. But it isn't very average, and that's the beauty of it. The story observed here carries a genuine believability to it that allows a gushy teenage girl who searches for the perfect love story to be able to relate to the film in a way that isn't as unrealistic as some other popular romance films. That's just what romantic films are right? Another relationship you wish you had? Not exactly the case here. Don't get me wrong, that is what this film is, but it really is much more than that. This film not only portrays an enviable romantic relationship between boy and girl, but also a relationship between man and life, man and the world, man and the now, and that's what allows it to be so powerful.The acting across the board is great. I have found that movies like this that have relatively undiscovered actors and actresses as the lead roles allow for a good connection from the audience to the story, especially when the story is a good one like it is here.Live in the now, because there's no way to know you're in the good ole' days until you've left them. And yes, I did steal that from The Office.8/10EDIT: Saw it a second time with a Q&A with Miles Teller after the film. Got to talk to him about 21 & Over real quick and he ended up talking a lot about how The Spectacular Now was somewhat rushed, shot in only 25 days and the most of the actors had met only minutes before shooting some intimate, emotional scenes such as the scenes with Sutter and his mother and father. Apparently the first words Kyle Chandler ever said to Miles were in character with the camera rolling. Also, *possible spoiler* but apparently the scene with Sutter and Amy's first bond moment at the party by the pond was a 5 minute rolling shot with the camera man holding a simple 35mm walking backwards, and at the end of the scene the camera man fell and they kept the ""arsty"" shaky shot of the sky in the film. He was a really cool guy and was very humble and just pretty normal.

This movie is better than good. It's thoughtful, provocative and paced just about right. While the movie is not fast moving, it is paced well enough to keep one's attention. The dialog is crisp and right on target. Not much wasted in any scene. Where a scene needed to be short like in Sutter's confrontation with his mother over seeing his father at her work, it's short enough. The scene where he meets his father is paced just as if someone were waiting to get out of a fad situation and move on with his own world. It wasn't dragged out so anyone would wallow in the scene. The surprise accident where Aimee gets hit by a car was down so well that you were sure Aimee was killed. Such is not the case and that whole subplot was well handled. The characters of Sutter and Aimee generate so much chemistry that one is reminded of Nick and Nore in their early movies when they were drinking all the time. Sutter drinks all the time but he's a sipper so only rarely gets smashed. He does lose his job because of alcohol though. He gets Aimee drinking regularly but she seems immune from the negatives that so enshroud Sutter, Everything in this movie is handled so well that one can see the reality of a person who operates as if nobody else mattered at all. Only Sutter's father is more is more self-centered than he. And one can see the wreckage that comes from such behavior. I was curious about the lack of marijuana in the movie. Usually people who abuse one drug, abuse several but this doesn't play out here. Even parties where there are lots of high school kids alcohol flows but no pot. That's surprising and the only unrealistic element not in the movie.While this kind of move is supposed to be about some life-changing moment or epiphany, This one doesn't deliver in the best way; it makes you wonder and any movie that can make me wonder is a good, no spectacular effort indeed. I will look for these two actors to show up again in other projects. Neither was known to me but I hope they get more opportunities after this major effort.",The Spectacular Now
109,jonruff108,A seriously misunderstood film,9,21 February 2016,"I was looking for a short film to watch tonight (I was short on time) so I browsed Roger Ebert's four star films on Amazon Prime and saw the Spectacular Now with a run time of only 90 minutes. ""What the hell,"" I thought. ""It must be at least decent if Ebert loved it - even if it does have Woodley."" I proceeded to watch the film (curse Prime for its terrible video quality) and was engrossed during the entire 90 minutes, despite a few minor flaws.I immediately checked the rating on IMDb and was taken-back by the (moderately) low score of 7.2. I read some of the boards and was shocked at the amount of disgust and dislike. I can wholeheartedly say that after reading some of the opinions of those on these boards, I understand where some of them are coming from. The movie is quite disgusting at times (especially with the excessive drinking, which is my only complaint), but let me explain myself.I am 17 years old. Yes, my age makes a difference here - not because I'm ""incapable"" of loving ""true"" film or because I'm only supposed to like specific movies catered to my particular demographic (ie Transformers, the Avengers) but because I am the age of the characters in this film. I can relate to them in a clearer way than, say, a 40 year old. Now, I'm not trying to say that this film can only be enjoyed by teens - quite the opposite - in fact, I can think of a lot of reasons why teens wouldn't like this movie. It's (as someone before me as said) ""painfully real,"" aside from the, once again, excessive drinking. It can be hard to accept something like this, I think. No, the reason some people love this film and others hate (yes, hate) it is because of personal experience. For me personally, I'm living this right now. For others, maybe they lived it already.Without needing to be said (I'll say it anyway), I have no experience with life. I shouldn't really have a say in such things. However, I do have similar experiences to that of Sutter, the protagonist of the story. No, I don't mean similar experiences in the way he drinks or has sex. The way he feels, the inner conflicts, the confusion and the sadness and pressure is what I can relate to - as can others.""Are you happy,"" Sutter asks his teacher, a full grown man - an adult. The teacher looks at him thoughtfully, taking his words to mind, and ponders the question. What makes a person happy? Are you happy?The Spectacular Now is a seemingly simple movie about a teen who wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous and in the process he gets drunk. That's what a lot of people see this movie as, and they're not wrong - that is, essentially, the film. However, I think there are numerous undertones and messages present throughout that suggest stronger themes. Themes like life, being alone, the meaning of happiness, what true emotion is and isn't, facing reality, societal expectations, and most importantly, facing ourselves. Sutter is a complex person. He's got it all figured out - or so it seems that way. He lies to himself and to others, convincing everyone and himself that everything is okay, that he feels fine, that he doesn't care when in fact none of this is true. He isn't okay, he doesn't feel fine, and he does care. As he says at the end (heavily paraphrased), ""I was afraid. Afraid of the pressure and the expectations. I didn't want to let myself down so I just hid it all.""This is a powerful statement. Many of us probably don't realize that we may not be happy - truly happy - and just play along with what we think is expected of us. I don't speak for everyone, obviously, but perhaps there are indeed those who feel in a similar way, such as myself. I'm at a point in my life where I'm still figuring things out - in fact I'm just starting. That's really what this movie is about. Acceptance. Happiness. The ability to move on and keep moving forward, to find things worth living for because without them, what is there? Sutter doesn't realize what's important until it's too late, which is unfortunately true for a lot of people in real life.The thing I really admire about this film is that it doesn't throw all this in our face. If it did, it wouldn't have the same effect because answers in life aren't thrown at us; they're given in code and we don't have the cipher to unlock it. We have to sit and think and reflect, which is exactly what this movie had me do during and after watching it.I honestly didn't expect this film to work. I feel like the only thing it had going for it was Ebert's four star review (speaking of Ebert, I believe this was the last film he ever reviewed. How fitting...) Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley were both absolutely brilliant in this picture. I will admit, Teller didn't always appear like he was a high school senior but Woodley, my god. Was she acting? Her performance was so natural and real. It was pretty amazing and has completely changed my opinion about her.Overall I guess you can tell I liked the film. There are some problems but I mean, suspension of disbelief; it's a movie.",The Spectacular Now
110,tomas-344-902574,Left me in awe,10,29 March 2014,"HOLY COW I am in total awe over this film... I will have to watch it at least two or three more times.... Imagine a wounded and bitter teenage boy with a flair for self- destruction, and yet the hint of a giant heart underneath it all, living with avoidance, hiding from the pain of feeling worthless from a mess of a father who left him long ago... and the ""plain jane"" girl he meets that somehow together they have this awesome chemistry... somehow he brings a certain passion for living that she is attracted to. You just know that the guy is a prick and you spend the whole movie waiting for him to ruin the only good thing to come his way, hoping (suspensefully) that he does the right thing. You don't know until the very end, how he quite deals with his baggage, if he can face his pain and feelings of failure and decide to grow up rather than always run away from it all. Let's just say that the ending is touching and that there's hope for him, that he's not the lost cause he thought he was, and that he begins to start recognizing that. This is the story of quite a few teenage boys out there, any teenage boy with an absent or distant father. Not every teen boy may harbor such self-deprecating feelings of himself, but we all definitely have felt drowned in our own sorrow, pain, fear, anger that ""dad"" wasn't there to love us through. You can relate it to anybody, that maybe even for the most broken of us, that somewhere underneath all the pain and self-destructive behavior is a raw and tender heart that can do and be good, even amazing, in this life. That you do have a choice to let go of the pain and choose to be that loving sensitive person instead of hating yourself so much.The story was written well, there is a curve ball about 3/4 of the way through the film that will catch you off guard, and puts you in the emotional mindset of the boy. It's almost as if in his own self- destructiveness that he pushes his unconditionally loving girlfriend away and in an instant shockingly almost loses her entirely, as if he was being damned (or taught a lesson) from a higher power. We just hope it sinks in.This story definitely has relevance today. There are way too many wounded men who shut themselves off from the pain simply because they don't have a clue how to deal with it. So they shut themselves down. There are women who get involved with these guys and it's sad that many women are so big-hearted that they overlook serious flaws in their men. You can't help but think that the girl's forgiveness/dedication in this film is a bit naive and dangerous for her own good. It's up to the man to grow up and deal with his baggage, otherwise it will bring the woman down with him later on. It's hopefully some sort of inspiration to the troubled boys/men out there to break the cycle.",The Spectacular Now
111,Callum_Hofler,Another Piece Of Gold From Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber!,9,22 December 2013,"The Spectacular Now is a film directed by James Ponsoldt, and stars Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley. It is another coming of age story, stories which have been high in demand this year. It is written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, the screenwriters for the film 500 Days of Summer, one of my favourite films of all time. My expectations for this film were high once I saw their names on it, and I don't think I was disappointed! The Spectacular Now centres around Miles Teller's character Sutter, a popular, hard partying senior, who has just exited a relationship due to a misunderstanding. He soon meets Shailene Woodley's character Aimee, a not-so-typical girl, who he quickly falls for. From there, we see the ups and downs of this wonderful relationship.The reason I loved 500 Days of Summer so much is the reason I loved The Spectacular Now so much; it's so incredibly real and relatable. Despite the age difference between myself and Sutter, I felt like he was doing and saying the things I would've said in the situations he was thrown into. This almost real portrayal of events allows you to put yourself in these characters shoes, and this adds a whole new dimension to the experience. I loved that this girl, Aimee, wasn't necessarily a social outcast, like so many teen girls in these coming of age stories. She was just a bit of geek, who managed to initiate a relationship with one of the more popular kids at school. She wasn't a girl bidding for his attention, and he wasn't massively obsessing over her. They just met, and got together. This is the perfect representation of the saying, more is less. These two people are normal kids, who just happened to get together. We didn't need anything more to spice it up, because this is generally how it really happens, and that's satisfying enough.The performances here are top class! Shailene Woodley gives a wonderful performance as this cute, nervous girl, and she continues to prove to me that she's a force to be reckoned with in the acting business. Miles Teller, like I stated before, gives an incredibly relatable, real performance, which allows me to connect to the character and see things in his eyes. He makes for a wonderful protagonist, and his chemistry with Shailene Woodley is absolutely wonderful. There are some wonderful performances from the rest of the ensemble, including one from Brie Larson and a very dark performance from Kyle Chandler. It's bliss to witness the acting talent take the stage here, and there isn't a single performance which I can narrow down to be disappointing. There isn't necessarily much more to add. The Spectacular Now is a film that really appeals to someone of my age, and surprised me heaps. It's real, certainly emotional and full of interesting, subtle characters which I grew to love. It begs a repeat viewing, one which shall take play very soon into the future. I adore this movie, almost as much as 500 Days of Summer.10/10",The Spectacular Now
112,edgereviews,The Spectacular Now review...,8,11 January 2014,"I really like coming of age films. There's something with them that clicks with me, in fact a little coming of age movie known as The Way Way Back is currently my favourite film of the year. The Spectacular Now is a coming of age story, but in a different vein to many others. I can't quite describe it, but it's so unique, very real yet feels so different to other movies of it's genre. Does The Spectacular Now beat The Way Way Back? No, but I didn't expect it too as I could relate to The Way Way Back in countless ways, and while I don't necessarily relate to the characters of The Spectacular Now, I can relate to their morals and messages, which help mould The Spectacular Now into the beautiful piece of cinema that it is.The Spectacular Now is perfectly written. Everything feels natural and flows together incredibly well. Characters are written and executed outstandingly, these are very complex characters that the actors pull off brilliantly. Miles Teller is phenomenal in the lead role, I can image that his character would be very challenging to portray but he does it excellently. Shailene Woodely is equally incredible, her and Teller steal the show. All of the supporting cast is excellent is well, including Kyle Chandler, Bob Odenkirk and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Also, I just wanted to say how damn good Brie Larson is. She steals every scene she's in, not just in this movie but in many others. I'm really looking forward to seeing her in Short Term 12, so I recommend you watch some of her movies as she's easily one of the best actresses currently in the business.James Pondsolt does a wonderful job directing. There's some beautiful cinematography, a good soundtrack and his direction fits everything together perfectly. I do have some minor niggles with the film, such as the main character's alcohol subplot. At times this would make me really dislike the character, which may have been intentional but I would rather have not had it happen. The biggest problem I have with the movie though is that I wanted to see more. The Spectacular Now is only 90 minutes long, and although I think it ended at the most absolutely perfect point it could have, I wish there could have been more before it. The characters are so compelling and their relationships so engaging that it seems like a waste to not use as much of it as you could have. But other than that, The Spectacular Now is an excellent film that I implore you watch.",The Spectacular Now
113,sahamh,A Very Satisfying Teenage Drama & Romance Movie,8,4 September 2013,"A film by James Ponsoldt and written by Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber, which is about a high school senior's life, his relationship, his family problems, his struggles and ideas about life. I personally didn't have a single idea about the plot; I just had seen some positive reviews and wanted to see how Shailene Woodley does in her second feature film.The story seems simple and boring, well it is a drama and somewhat teenage romance, so it can be boring to some people, but to me it's very engaging, and indeed it gets predictable but the story is told so beautifully that absorbed me to the end, and perhaps it's because of my own personal experience in three different high schools in USA. For example, there's a scene at the prom, Sutter (Miles Teller) looks around at his friends and says ""this is as young as we get, I love these people"" and screams ""I love you all;"" I personally just loved this scene, it reminded me of my own senior year that once at lunch time I was sitting alone and looking at my friends talking and laughing, and I just told myself ""I love these kids and I'll f-cking miss them,"" I regret that I didn't yell it out, and that scene for the first time in the past decade made me to regret for not going to prom, I wish that I asked her! The performances just drive the movie and keep you involved and invested with the characters; Miles Teller does a fine job here as the leading role; Shailene Woodley, I absolutely love how she plays this innocent, kind hearted, and sweet character, it might look similar but it's different from The Descendant and she's just so charming and obviously very pretty; Mary Elizabeth Winstead, first of all I'm a big fan of hers, and they've done a wonderful job for picking her as Sutter's sister, Winstead and Teller just look so perfect as a sibling, and she does a sweet job even though she's got a small role – I only and ONLY visualized her as the protagonist of my first screenplay, I hope to sell it one day and have her to play Mindy, a dream will come true! The cinematography and score are fine, I can't really brag about them but they're fine enough to this low budget film, no bitching needed either – I'm so damn glad they could shoot it in 35mm though.Overall, I really enjoyed this film, a lot of people might disagree, but again I personally got connected and touched by it, and I will buy it on DVD/BluRay. It's not a fresh or new but it's sweet, I give it 8/10.",The Spectacular Now
114,TiagoRicardo,A great surprise,9,23 December 2013,"There are those movies that touch you in a way that is hard to absorb. ""The Spectacular Now"" is one of those movies. It's not the regular teen drama. ""The Spectacular Now"" is about dreams, about seizing the moments and about love. It is the story of a popular young boy who meats a sweet girl and a series of events that follow that moment. As a 20 year-old man, it's hard for me to describe the mix of feelings I had, while I was watching this movie. It's so deep, so beautiful and so unique. ""The Spectacular Now"" is more than a wonderful surprise. It was a movie that made me think about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. ""The Spectacular Now"" is without a doubt, a beautiful and fascinating story about the discovery of ourselves and the true meaning of love.

It's depressing and underwhelming for most of the film, but that adds the realism, nothing seems fake about it. The acting, dialogue, etc. All is top notch, even 26 year old Miles Teller still does a convincing job posing as a high school student. The story is somewhat predictable, but then it does have its own personal twists that leave you going ""hmm, didn't see that coming"". Miles Teller reminds me a lot of a young John Cusack, his overall look and mannerisms are slightly similar to John's, if not slightly more turned up. If you are looking for A Walk to Remember or She's All That, look elsewhere, because this movie is anything but. It's a slap you in the face realistic portrayal of the teenager in today's world. Many would argue that this isn't all true, but coming from someone who was a teenager not all that long ago, I can say this movie is pretty darn close. A good watch overall.",The Spectacular Now
116,fraghera,This movie is not about dreams.,8,29 December 2013,"As a 30 year old, when I look behind, I saw a lot of movies but only few of them can touched my heard. Its very hard to express yourself in another language, a language that you learn after your native. So basically, sometimes its easy to criticize most of the movies. We find a topic or someone have already done. Than we use it. But without saying anything about this kind of rare movies, we have to think twice. This movie makes you think about yourself, your past, your mistakes. Ank of course its not too late cos we are still all alive, so maybe we can change something inside us. This movie try to tell something close to that.The ending is very important for every movie. And usually we can not find what we expect. Or we saw exactly what we expect and this makes us unhappy. This like some kind of paradox. So the movie have to give us something we don't expect but in the mean time it should not be exactly what we expect. And in this case, when you look at the Aimee's (Shailene Woodley) eyes at the end, they give everything I mentioned. The movie closes perfectly. Its something like real life. This movie is not about dreams. This movie is about real life. Recommended.",The Spectacular Now
117,elvisrivet-1,Spectacular Now,9,11 February 2014,"The Spectacular Now tells the story of Sutter Keely a high school student who lives with his divorced mother. Sutter is charming, he's the kind of guy that everyone can have a laugh with and he just happens to be the life of the party. There's one slight problem though, Sutter has a bit of a drinking problem. Sutter eventually meets Aimee who's a shy, quiet, calm, and reserved girl who happens to be a bit of a geek at the same time. These two characters are completely opposite from each other, Sutter is the party type who lives in the moment while Aimee is this shy and quiet girl who doesn't really have much of a social life before meeting Sutter. The whole reason these two characters work together well is because they're different from each other, they offset each other in a way. Sutter teaches Aimee to be more open with everything, he teaches her to stand up for herself instead of letting everyone walk all over her. Meanwhile Aimee teachers Sutter that maybe he needs to stop living in the moment all the time and think about what the future could hold, she shows Sutter love and compassion. Something Sutter has been missing in his life, but unfortunately Sutter doesn't seem to care much about this and ignores it. The director of The Spectacular Now is James Ponsoldt who does a great job with the screenplay written by 500 Days Of Summer writers, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. James Ponsoldt shoots the film in a beautiful way that can't help but make you feel good about yourself; Ponsoldt really knows how to shoot but doesn't overdo it and carefully selects his scenes. Miles Teller does a terrific job as Sutter and he really makes you feel for the character, we as an audience are willing to go on this journey with Sutter because Miles takes us with him. Miles comes off as confident in the role and this isn't a bad thing because the screenplay calls for that, his acting ability really shows during this movie. We also have Shailene Woodley as Aimee who is beautiful; she portrays Aimee as this quiet and shy girl which is exactly what the screenplay called for. Woodley is one of those actresses that you could never get bored of because she brings so much to her roles; I look forward to seeing her in many more films. Everyone else is able to deliver good performances all around but its Miles and Woodley who stand out in the film and make us really believe in their characters, and make us fall in love with them. The screenplay itself is written well with none of the dialogue coming off as being to cheesy or unbelievable. Usually with films like this, the screenplay is written cheesy to the point where you can't really anything for the characters because they're to perfect and seem fake. With the Spectacular Now on the other hand, you have characters you actually care for and a story that has heart to it and feels very real. I have to give credit to Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber for writing a screenplay that actually works and allows you to believe in the characters and story, and takes us on a journey back to when we were in high school. The Spectacular Now takes us back during a time when were in high school and falling in love for the first time, a time where many of us finally realized who we were and the person we were meant to be. The film shows the struggles during high school and the problems it comes with, it shows us that high school doesn't define you but instead is just one stage of your life that you must go through with, it shows us what it's like to fall in love for the first time. I'm giving The Spectacular Now a solid a 4.5/5 stars.",The Spectacular Now
118,btnthx,Spectacular spectacular,10,15 August 2013,"Growing up I always had a pretty utopian view on what being a teenager in high school would be like. Once I got there, it was nothing like what I had thought, and plus we had no kids that looked like James Spader. Just because high school was not like a John Hughes film didn't make it a bad thing, I just think I would have had more fun at those schools than mine. Now a day in the perfect world is not what people want, they want something real, and in ""The Spectacular Now"" it feels like what being a teenager feels like today.Now being a middle-aged man this is only a guess, but it sure feels right on. Sutter (Miles Teller) is that guy everyone likes, you know the life if any party. Sutter is enjoying every minute of high school, great times, and a great girlfriend named Cassidy (Brie Larson) to top it off. Sutter also likes to drink, and not the typical teenage drinking, he goes as far as carrying a flask and even putting alcohol in anything he drinks. After Cassidy breaks up with him, Sutter drinks a little too much and ends up passed out in the front of a house, not his own. He is found by Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who knows Sutter from school. Sutter starts to gather interest in Aimee, but all the while hoping to land back with the women he thinks he wants in Cassidy. Aimee has never had a boyfriend and quickly starts to fall for Sutter hard. With school ending soon, Sutter is all about the now, and has no idea what his future will hold, he never wants to grow up, because where is the fun in that? A lot of people think that their high school years were their highest point in their life. I mean you have no worries, no responsibilities, you just live life. Everything is easier, including love because how innocent everything is. Sutter and Aimee are at that point where things start to move, college and life are in front of them making them have to make choices they never had to before. Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber (500 Days of Summer) from the book by Tim Tharp, the story is a real coming of age story. I know that is a bad description, but where so many coming of age stories fail, this one soars. It is all perfectly directed by James Ponsoldt (Smashed), who set the movie in his home town of Athens, Georgia, and even shot the film in locations he grew up in. It all comes together by the flawless performances by Woodley and Teller who are perfect for each other on screen. I sometimes think what it would be like to grow up in this day and age, well I think I just got to see what life is like today and like this movie it looks spectacular.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",The Spectacular Now

120,meeshoffmanns,A very Natural and Raw portrayal of a Beautiful yet Painful Relationshhip,8,15 March 2019,"I am a big fan of Shailene Woodley since Divergent, and watching this movie convinced me she was a solid powerhouse in terms of acting. She and Miles Teller have incredible chemistry in this realistic little tale, and it is (one of) the best coming-of-age movie(s) I have ever seen.Acting:
Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are incredible here. They carry this movie effortlessly, delivering a wide range of raw and honest emotion. They show natural portrayals of young people with each having their own problems and unique attributes. Their chemistry is amazing and made me feel giddy every time they shared a scene together(which was a lot).While the supporting cast is not in it quite a lot, they manage to deliver exactly what is required of them, and make a very solid impact on the story and characters. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kyle Chandler in particular excel at this. Brie Larson is kind of wasted in here, because there is a sense that her character could play a more significant part than is actually shown.Direction:
James Ponsold new exactly how to handle this movie, and while a lot of the dialogue can easily be mistaken for being cheesy, he manages time after time to make it feel intimate and honest, delevering a very realistic and raw tone. It reminds you of Barry Jenkins' style somewhat.Cinematography:
This goes hand in hand with the direction, since a lot of it is shot without any flair or fancy movements, but filled with close-ups and ""awkward"" handheld angles to establish the tone and mindset of scene and characters. It works really well, and is adding a lot.Plot:
While it seems pretty straightforward, the characters are far smarter and more complex than it seems, and you easily become fascinated with their mindset and what drives their decisions. There is room for humor, heartbreak, and tension, and resolves in a great ambiguous way.Editing:
This movie flows very nice from one scene to the next, with a fancy style that manages to be perfectly natural at the same time. It is really impressive work and truly fits the type of movie it belongs to.Tone:
Because of the intimacy that is achieved with camera and direction, this movie feels really sensitive and natural consistently, and can shift from being hilarious through dramatic and heartbreaking with hardly any effort. It does exactly what it needs to do.General Concensus:
This is a typical example of a movie that achieves everything it sets out to do. Thanks to great acting and direction, the characters are very relatable and feel like real people that deserve happiness. The message is important for both young people and adults, and hits hard enough to be conveyed. 8.6/10",The Spectacular Now

The movie gives the viewers a factual and sometimes, melancholic reflection of ordinary occurrences in ordinary people's lives- it might be someone they know, family, friends, or even themselves.The main actors did a great job, especially Shailene Woodley. She is so natural she actually gave a convincing portrayal of a young woman who struggles to stand up for herself while providing for her family.

You can read the synopsis of the story, which will give you an idea of what to expect, but the story did not matter to me.Personally, I am sick of these movies: adult conceptions of what it is like to be in high school. Teenagers are 'cool' and 'witty' and 'so emotionally developed and open'. When kids are in high school, they are treated like idiots; yet, in movies they are god forsaken prophets. People love movies like 'The Spectacular Now' and for some reason they always ring false to me, which is probably why I am wildly unsuccessful. The main character, high school student, son to a single mother, he drives a better car than me and has a better computer; he works part time at a clothing store and drinks all the time. That's a cool character; he has great dialogue. He is not a teenager though. He is an adult creation of what a writer should have been like in high school. I know because I think about it all the time.People call this a coming of age story with complex characters. That is what people want in a story, which I don't agree with (why I am very unsuccessful). If you take out the main character's dialogue and attitude, it's the typical guy loves a girl and you wouldn't expect them to love each other, but they do --- wow curve ball dramatic event to get you invested--work through emotional problems and realize one very small thing that can be almost like an eastern philosophical statement (applicable to nothing and everything at the same time, as water is never truly still).But, the story was well crafted, the filming and production and dialogue were great. It was well written and every actor and actress performed wonderfully. If this movie wasn't getting popular, honestly (if it was rated as a 5) I'd probably rate it at an 8 just to show how much of a free thinker I am.",The Spectacular Now

While having a romantic element, this movie didn't contain all of the conventions that normally come with a romantic movie. However, I still enjoyed the movie. It was a dramatic take on someone's life. The main characters are played quite nicely and I would've hated to be hit by that car (I wouldn't have been as nice as she was). I was also hoping (well not hoping just expecting) that the father had done something more than just be someone who cares only about themselves. I also wanted this girl the beat the crap out of him when he came back to her, or at least let them have a final embrace before the movie ended. I was sincerely unimpressed with the film even though I liked the story line.",The Spectacular Now

I do not recall any big flash campaign stating this is a must see movie of the year blah blah blah. The concept of this movie is simple. From a guys perspective, it takes you back to a time when your mind just could not figure out how to incorporate day to day family issues with your suave lifestyle. Whether you are a buy or a gal, if you ever had a crush on someone you could not have, fell in love, argued with a teacher, worried about homework/tests, made a jerk of yourself, sneaked a beer, etc when you were going to school you should watch this flick. It is definitely NOT what I thought it was going to be. I expected a cutsie guy chases girl movie with comical mayhem ensuing... well it is funny, bit it is also serious and sad and deep and very real.",The Spectacular Now
126,dimoulas-466-176153,A truthful and thoughtful high school film,8,13 February 2014,"The Spectacular Now was a movie that started off weak but ended really strongly. It opens with and uses a lot of high school movie clichés throughout the film, I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama, but then I thought, why am I trying to put it into a category?What the film dealt with extremely well was the use of dialogue. The conversations the high school characters had with each other were not particularly interesting, witty, or philosophical, but they were truthful. I thought it sounded like what people sounded like in high school, though it has been a while since I was in high school, so I may be wrong about that. From what I do remember, the ""cool"" thing was to not care, not care about life, grades, college, or any of that stuff, it was ""cool"" to go to parties, a sentiment the main character, Sutter, would agree with. The passionate people were the un-cool people, the ""nerds."" I guess this would be the love interest Aimee. Shailene Woodley brought life to this movie, where as before it was just about an alcoholic, pain in the ass teenager. She loves science fiction. She's a dreamer and she fell in love easily. She might be considered naïve, yet, she was the one who planned for the future, and caused Sutter to think about his.I found it hard to believe that Shutter would keep getting into bars to drink excessively, what I did believe was his character and his journey, mainly the relationships he had, and his philosophies on life. The film does not have a climatic ending, nor should it. Stupid high school life sucked and real life kind of sucks too, but that's life.",The Spectacular Now
127,meganlellman,"A toxic, unhealthy relationship",3,29 August 2018,"Sutter is an alcoholic who is obviously not over his ex girlfriend. He gets Amy to go out with him and to drink, claiming that he was ""helping her"" (this is what he told his friend as an explanation for why he would even go out with Amy). In a fit of rage he kicks her out of his car and because of that she gets hit by a car. Even though he consistently treats her poorly, she keeps taking her back. You can tell that she has low self-esteem and he is just using that so that he doesn't have to be alone. There is not one moment in this film that shows why he is even interested in her. It was very difficult to watch this relationship unfold. I chose this film because I love the actors but they were just okay in this film. Maybe they weren't given enough to work with. Overall, not a fan of this movie",The Spectacular Now
128,amsby17,Carefree and Popular - Amazing Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley,7,7 September 2014,"Remember when being fun, friendly and carefree ranked supreme? The Spectacular Now peers into Sutter's (Miles Teller) life during his last few months of high school as a popular senior. He's utterly mastered all those wonderful qualities - yet the beauty and charm of this central figure are his imperfections. All the character flaws exposed in this film add authenticity that play on feelings of nostalgia masterfully. Miles Teller is no movie star (yet) but he was born for this role. There's no denying that the premise of the The Spectacular Now hasn't been done a thousand times before, but its honesty, simpleness and compelling realism will save it from the forgotten stockpiles of bad teen dramas of yesteryear.Now - about the girl. Aimee (played by the fantastic Shailene Woodley of The Descendants) is a sweet, doe-eyed little beauty who by chance stumbles upon Sutter as she's delivering papers. He takes up with her on a whim (and as a not-so-well planned distraction from his recent ex-girlfriend). Aimee's innocent and impressionable heart quickly swoons. The dialogue and body language between Aimee and Sutter speaks volumes about the attention to detail and earnestness of this film. Revolving teen themes of driving, friends and drinking and partying are interwoven into the story well.The Spectacular Now subtly shows the beauty of middle-America and even high school. It beckons viewers to remember a time when so much was still unknown and prom was a really big deal. Without being overtly sappy, it effectively tells the story of how one booze-guzzling high school clown learned how to grow up and recognize the real value of the people around him - especially the girl that unquestioningly loves him.",The Spectacular Now
129,williamhume,Current and Timeless,10,27 September 2013,"The Spectacular Now is the best movie I've seen this week. And saying that in comparison to Prisoners last Saturday followed by Fruitvale Station on Wednesday as a critic I think really means something. I only decided to see it 48 hours ago, brother Sam raved about it and I checked the show times for a movie that premiered in July (á la Fruitvale) and low and behold it was showing at a theatre that is due to close by the end of the year. I asked a lot of people to go see this movie with me (as I have with everyone all week) and preferably ones that wouldn't ruin the movie by talking, but no dice. I am in the middle of one of the best cinematic streaks I've experienced (completely opposite to the rough one I had in April) and I'm experiencing it alone. But I must say it is great running to theatre, not waiting on anyone or worrying about them bugging you, or you annoying them, its not awkward but a pleasant experience. But the one disadvantage to that scheme is that you have no one to experience the film with. Not someone to agree or disagree with, or talk to about it afterwards, you can only sit around and tell someone how great this is and that they're missing it, and hope that they listen enough to take that opportunity to go see the best film I've seen all year.Maybe its because I'm getting older and my taste is maturing but two things are changing for me in the realm of movies right now; I'm more excited for the fall prestige films than the summer blockbusters, and as I see more and more films I find less the point at which your staring at the screen for awhile and you forget that your watching a movie. You don't think about the technical stuff, the cinematography, the music or overall direction, the performances don't get in the way and you don't think to yourself how he or she (the actor) is doing. In that moment you are completely absorbed in the now. These spectacular moments are for me what filmmaking should strive for and is all about. And it is completely present in this film.I always have reservations going in, anyone who knows me knows about my constant over thinking and sometimes overbearingly specific expectations. I thought that going in that I was too old for this story about two young lovers graduating high school. I've never had a girlfriend, I can't relate. Its past that moment for me I thought. And the set up to that story very much is, as I am in fact older than that and have graduated high school. But in the casting of older experienced actors: Shailene Woodley (21) and Miles Teller (26), the writers are able to tell a mature story that has gravitas and a weight attached to it. I found myself able to relate to the main character a whole lot, and I was completely surprised and shocked at one point to realize just how emotionally entangled I was. It grabbed me and held on for just the right amount of time, and when it let go the movie was over.If your wondering or really even care to know, I will add as a side note to this review that everyone is well cast; Bob Odenkirk as the mens store manager and boss to the protagonist (a subtle metaphor) and Kyle Chandler as a runaway father to Teller both perform in small but crucial supporting roles for this coming of age drama. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who after seeing her name in the credits of so many movies I've watched but never bothered to look up I'm realizing now was the mother in the film. I'll give her her due, she's always a character and never an actor.The writers behind this movie have taken everything that was terrible or badly executed from their previous effort and moved it 500 Days of Summer away, in the right direction- under James Pondsolt. They decide not to tell you a story but show you one instead. And it is very Spectacular. The best Romantic drama I have ever seen.Rating: +3/ A+-3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3",The Spectacular Now

But the way the movie was put together & the chemistry between the two main characters, carry the story throughout. Not a let down or drag time, a lot of even highly touted movies often have.If there is a flaw, I would have to say the direction in the photography was phoned in for some of the scenes. It could be purposely, for that ""low budget"" feel? The characters played well off of each other & the storyline flowed very well. The supporting cast played very well too.All in all, this movie might be one of those spectacular surprises, that grace the red carpet at Oscar time.Good luck to this film.",The Spectacular Now

IMO the best of the crop are THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER and THE WAY WAY BACK. Unfortunately, I can't put THE SPECTACULAR NOW in the same league. There just was nothing special about it. I think the main problem I had with the film was that (1) I didn't connect with any of the main characters as I did with PERKS, and (2) I didn't find it funny or heartwarming like WAY WAY BACK. To me, NOW seemed more like a TV movie than anything else. I mean, what was so original about the boy being like the father he never saw?

133,kazekiw,Coming of age in a very well put manner,10,14 June 2015,"At first I was not too fond of watching this movie. Even though I may get some hate for this, I've never really liked the films Shailene Woodley has picked, and I had no idea who Miles Teller was until ""Whiplash"" came out in 2014. Despite my lack of excitement I sat down the other evening and watched it.I absolutely fell in love with this movie. The message, the acting, the dialogue, everything seemed to be so well done. I was shocked how good both the leads did in this movie. Miles Teller captured his role very well and really showed us who his character was and what he was thinking about his life and others. Shailene Woodley was so good as well. She seemed shy, and vulnerable, it really allowed me to relate to a couple people I knew in High School. Many of the supporting characters are well acted and at some points it seems like they are completely useless to the story. However, these characters help age and mature the leads and aid them in their journey of growing up.The dialogue was extremely well written, executed, and directed by James Ponsoldt. It really reminded me of an actual high school conversation which seems somewhat immature but overall insightful on the characters feelings towards life. If you get a chance to see this movie, jump on the opportunity. It'll definitely make you laugh and give you some real life legitimate drama that will really make you wish you were apart of the story.",The Spectacular Now

The relationship he has with his mother in the film is something truly magical.The soundtrack is so unique and if you listen to the soundtrack alone, you are able to follow the story just as clearly.

Just the way things delved together in such a short amount of time. Rarely, do you get to see this atypical type of romantic comedy/drama, what have you.

I kept waiting for the smart ass we have come to love in his other films to appear but was only offered a watered down, pathetic, alcoholic version. I never cared enough about his character because he was always a self-serving jerk. Where was the realization that usually comes when a character nearly kills someone? Where was the desire to redeem himself?The film was beautifully shot with perfect use of color and light but that was not enough to make up for a weak script and disappointing characters.

This movie did an exceptional job of hitting reality. Everything about this movie was believable, and all the actors fit their roles. This movie had a similar feel in style to Ruby Sparks, in that at the heart it was a romance, but there was a lot more too it. Family drama, fear of the future, alcohol, and even friend drama were all in this, just like most teens experience.In a Q&A afterwords an audience member asked why this was such a idealistic school, and why it didn't have any bullying and the truth is, because even though those exist, most schools don't have a serious problem with it.Another audience member said they didn't recognize anyone in the movie, and that the lack of makeup made it feel more real.

139,agp003,The Spectacular Now is a Spectacular Movie,10,7 August 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it was going to be another cute teen romance. But I did not realize the story's darker undertones, and the film as a whole took me by surprise. After seeing the movie, I realized that the director of The Spectacular Now, James Ponsoldt has an underlying theme in all of his movies: alcoholism (the most recent one being Smashed, which came out last year).Sutter Keely (Miles Teller in a moving, nuanced performance) is as he says ""the life of every party"". He is a goofy, nice kid who goes through his life in high school focusing on living in the present rather than thinking about his future. Sutter parties hard, but does not study hard and is thinking about not going to college. He hides all his inner turmoil away with his goofiness. But inside he is a wreck. He is an alcoholic and sneaks his booze in with a small flask and spikes his drinks with it. Inside Sutter is wondering what became of his dad. What happened to him and where did he go? His mom doesn't tell him and she won't let Sutter near him either. His teacher Mr. Aster, tries to persuade him to study hard and believes in him, but sees that Sutter does not care. That all changes for Sutter when one day, he meets a friendly, and rather private girl with a warm smile named Aimee Finicky who reads science fiction and has never had a boyfriend (Shailene Woodley in an award worthy performance). Aimee and Sutter are polar opposites, yet she helps him with geometry homework and he helps her open up to the world in front of her. Their relationship as friends together grows, and they soon fall in love. But as they confront the challenges of growing up, tragedy strikes.The screenplay, by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber based on a book by Tim Tharp, does not take the easy way out, and the end result is both hopeful and heartbreaking. The supporting roles also do very well and help add insight and humor to a film with mostly serious intentions. Also the film does not rely on stereotypical roles we see in most coming of age movies. There is no bully or stoner dude that's there for no reason at all. All supporting roles serve a purpose in Sutter and Aimee's eventual growing up, and all of them have at least one moment to shine. Of course Aimee and Sutter are not perfect, they are good people who sometimes make bad choices. And that is what appealed to me most of all. They seem perfectly plausible as people and my only compliant is that the movie was only 95 minutes long. I wish it were an eternity longer.",The Spectacular Now
140,pbhaskal,"good acting, good performances",9,7 March 2021,"Sutter's character was kind of grey. At times he acted good, at times bad, which is quite realistic.

Alcohol issues causes problems, accidents, job loss etc. And not so easy to recover.Film ending was good too. It doesn't have that ""all ends perfectly"" stuff like in usual romantic mmovies.

I was not able to care about Sutter; yes, he's a jackass, he has issues, who would care about him? But that's not why I didn't liked him. I don't think Miles Teller's work was bad, not everything of it at least, but his character was unable to make me sympathize for him; maybe that was the whole point, to like him overtime in his, unwilling, search for himself. But that never happened.This didn't made me feel a thing. Yeah, some laughs; but it's drama failed to get me.

142,nativeapache,Watch Innocence Destroyed of a Young Girl,7,10 March 2014,"If you like to see a sweet and innocent girl get hurt (emotionally and physically) by a popular drunk high school jerk than this movie is for you. Acting good, dialog good, plot good but it miffs me to know end (spoiler coming)how the movie alludes to Aimee and Sutter getting back together in the end.There's a scene where Sutter comes over to Aimee's room to help him study for school, and as Aimee's character is being revealed during this scene the only thing I could think of was oh please, please, please, don't hurt Aimee, and of course Sutter does just that. Eventually their burgeoning relationship runs into conflict as Sutter's alcohol addiction seems to get the best of him and Aimee is physically placed into harm's way as a result of this addiction.There's some redemptive qualities to Sutter but honestly not enough for him to deserve Aimee. It's still an enjoyable movie to watch, even though I don't particularly like the outcome of the plot I'm not going to black ball it into a low rating. I'm merely noting my disdain for the plot and for the message it may give to impressionable teenagers that staying in a relationship even when you may become physically harmed is okay and that to me is not okay.",The Spectacular Now
143,olivurtwist,"Finally, something simple.",8,29 August 2014,"The end of this movie completely surprised me by making me tear up. The last movies I cried in were 8 Below and Marley & Me, to give you an idea of my emotions. There was something about this movie.. it was so entirely short. I watched the whole thing and felt like it took half an hour. It did not drag for me, make me bored, sleepy, or annoyed. Maybe I'm partial to it because I simply adore when producers and writers and actors can make us think instead of dumbing it down and putting every piece of the puzzle on display for us... Shailene and Miles gave us a story of truth. However, I did not believe that ""awesome"" was an adjective Shailene would use every day, and I did not like how she never once questioned Miles or got mad at him at all-- for anything he ever did to himself or her. I wanted her to stick up for herself, which is ironic because Miles did as well. But we have to differentiate between what we want and what someone else is. I decided to get over it because she could be my best friend who picks all the wrong guys. I can't rate this movie less because she isn't who I want her to be. That isn't constructive or fair to the producers. Shailene should receive some praise for putting ""faithful and doting"" out there as a platform. If she is going to take him for all he is and is not, so be it. Everyone keeps calling Miles a prick who shouldn't have ended up with anybody. I'm sorry, but that is his father. Maybe no one noticed, but this is a story about breaking the cycle. Turning ""now"" into a spectacular moment. Being better. Watch the ending again and you will not have a valid reason to say he should end up alone. Give him a break; he's your son, your nephew, your husband, your father, and your best friend's boyfriend. He spends his days screwing up and then fixing his errors, just like the rest of us. I don't know. I liked it a lot. It was short and blunt and to really get it, you have to look farther than the screen. They were each battling inner demons and this little gem shows us it isn't always glamorous and perfect on the other side. I cried a little at the scene before last. I saw myself and everything I'm scared of becoming. Miles is right when he recognizes his philosophy. We could learn from this.",The Spectacular Now
144,bill_the_butcher7,'The Spectacular Now' Isn't that Spectacular,6,1 January 2014,"Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) is a high school senior who only has one goal: to live in the 'now'. He parties often, and when he is not drinking at parties, he is drinking alone. After being dumped by his girlfriend (Brie Larson), Sutter drinks so heavily that he wakes up on the front lawn of his classmate Aimee Finicky (Shailene Woodley). While Aimee may not seem like Sutter's type (this will be hit over the head many times by Sutter's best friend), the two connect immediately and change each other over the school year.The chemistry between Sutter and Aimee is very strong throughout the whole film and a lot of it feels unscripted and off the cuff. Director James Ponsoldt has a knack for making his characters feel very 'real', as evidenced by his 2012 film Smashed. In particular, a long tracking scene of the two talking and walking through the woods at a party is one of the best in the film; you can really see the characters start to fall for each other.But the strong chemistry isn't enough to make this coming-of-age story stand out as much as it should. One major issue with the film is that Sutter is really the only character fully developed. Aimee's sole purpose of existence is to assist Sutter from narrative story point A to B. She clearly has problems of her own, most notably with her mother. Aimee does her mother's paper route most mornings due to her late night partying and her mother detests her wanting to go to college, but their whole relationship is shown off screen.Another issue in the film is the lack of consequences. This film does not need a moral Disney ribbon wrapped over it, but it starts to feel a little strange watching Sutter drink so often throughout the film with so little regrets plaguing his actions. A violent scene late in the film resulting from his drunk driving would call for a big change in his character, but the event is seemingly swept under the rug and forgotten about two scenes later. Even after almost failing high school and losing his job, his drinking continues but, in the end, is not the reason for his self-realization. Alcoholism is dealt with so strongly throughout the film while at the same time being completely ignored.The film works on many levels, but the narrative issues keep it from being a defining coming-of- age story. The direction makes it a head better than many other films in its genre, and the two leads are very fun to watch, even if the screenplay leaves a little more to be desired.",The Spectacular Now
145,nico-hvi,"Shallow to a fault, yet with some redeeming features",6,19 December 2013,"Common adjectives used in reviews of this film were words like ""charming"", and ""charismatic"" - adjectives used to describe the main character, Sutter Keely (played by Miles Teller). I will use neither, because quite frankly I found Sutter's character to be neither charming, nor charismatic. In fact I felt he completely lacked depth and character (ironically enough), and thus found it extremely hard to empathize with him - which, for a film relying heavily upon empathy to get its message across, does not bode well.In the early stages of the film you're told (by Sutter himself) that he is the life of every party, that he has tons of friends etc., but you never really see any evidence of this. The only time I ever saw a resemblance of friendship was during his conversations with Ricky, which sort of undermines the entire point of Sutter being 'popular'. At one point in the film it's noted that Sutter is thought of as a 'joke' by several people, but we never see any mention of this so it's hard to make sense of this comment, because we're not given any context. His mom also claims that 'everybody loves him', but again we're shown no examples of this and, hey, what mom doesn't say that to her kids?The love interest is played very believably by Shailene Woodley (what a weird name), and is a redeeming feature of this film because she makes the main character realize what a complete douche he is (even though it takes a while). However, their relationship feels extremely like a case of ""Hey, I can get with this girl - though I don't really want to, but there's no one else around at the moment - so why not?', and I don't really see that lasting, even though Mr. Neustadter and Mr. Weber insist in the final scenes that 'common, why not? Stranger things have happened, right?'.Sutter does finally realize that he's a total tool by always keeping things shallow, and literally being buzzed all the time as a defence mechanism (which I thought was a nice touch), and tries to turn things around. This final realization was good, but the film had yet to show any redeeming qualities of Sutter's personality to make me really care for the guy (I mean they did try to shove it in our face by saying ""Hey, he totally carried this kid's books when he was in third grade and really didn't have to"", but that's just lazy storytelling). In the end, it just felt like too little too late.In my opinion this film comes off as too shallow to truly pack the emotional punch needed for it to work (though there are some nice scenes here and there), and as an example of a better coming-of-age story combined with personal drama I'd strongly recommend the fantastic Mud (2012) instead.",The Spectacular Now

Miles Teller was perfect as the popular frat boy Sutter with a troubled past and Shailene Woodley was endearing and sweet as the quiet smart girl Aimee.

He then meets Aimee, although I do like Shailenne Woodley and she couldn't have played the part any better, I always think it's a bit sad that directors think that it's always the female who has to play the weak and somewhat broken and unpopular character who needs help seeing her true beauty because she can't see it on her own.

This movie is the most pretentious piece of crap I've ever seen in the theaters.Imagine a movie where every single character is a stereotype and not even a good stereotype. Theirs the obvious popular jock, the obvious popular girl, the obvious weird girl who is nice, and the obvious arse hat that everyone is supposed to relate tooThis story tries to tell a coming of age story when its just crappy cliché after crappy cliché you don't give a crap about any of the other characters because you know nothing about them to begin with. Then the movie gives us the main character of Strutter keep in mind this is the guy that's the main character the guy who we are all supposed to relate too in that age of the high school days, when it turns out that he is the most unlikable character ever put in a movie. He just wants to live in the now and party and get @%#% faced all the time, his gf breaks up with him so he gets a new one who is the only likable character in the movie, he takes her virginity and what does he do you may ask? He tries to make his ex jealous and tells his best friend ""Whatever doesn't matter to me"" You can never tell if this guy is sober when hes talking to this girl or wasted because he asks her out to prom drunk and what does he give her for a gift not a corsage that's way to likable he gives her a flask yeah that's a catch right there. When they get to the prom he doesn't dance with her he dances with his ex right in front of her, wow just wow.Their is also this subplot in the movie about him wanting to know what his dad is like when he finds out who he is what do you expect a degenerate who never gave a crap about him and when his gf gets hit by a bus how does he cope by going to bar to drink his troubles away. The movie is so lazy so unlikable that the ending of this film and I'm not even joking here it ends on the Edward Cullen and Bella Swan ocward stare. The thing that pisses me off the most is that almost every review I've read on this movie says its a masterpiece when this is an incredibly unlikable movie from beginning to end. Never in my life have I ever wanted to walk out of film and punch the ticket counter to make him give me my money back for sitting through this hour and a half of torture never and I mean never watch this movie EEEEEVVVVEEEEERRR!!!!",The Spectacular Now

I'm always dubious of these kinds of films after the tragedy that was The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but I am so happy that I gave it a chance. Teller's performance teamed with the beauty that is Shailene Woodley was magical and I loved the connection that they had. The story was so deep and truthful that I was enticed within the first 10 minutes, the reality of the situation hitting hard. There was so much depth to the characters and you really felt empathy for them, which I think is often difficult with these kinds of characters. It's shocking, beautiful and heartbreaking and I'm willing to say this is in my top 10 releases of 2013.",The Spectacular Now

152,thereisnothingleft,A refreshing take,9,17 December 2013,"I found The Spectacular now to be a very refreshing movie to watch. We've all seen the coming of age high school romance blahblahblah thing before, but the film takes you where you didn't expect it to go, and that is one of the qualities that makes it a great experience.Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are fantastic, particularly Woodley. I don't know how you can't be a fan of Teller, he is his usual self in this one and adds even more depth to himself. Woodley's as real as it gets in her performance. I didn't notice it until my second viewing in terms of how natural she was, but she was terrific.Those two are already great to cast as leads, but it's always fun when the casting for anything is just all around fantastic. Tamper your expectations a bit because it's all about the leads in this one, but Coach Taylor, Bubbles, and Saul Goodman are great in the limited time they are on screen. I mean, Kyle Chandler, Andre Royo, and Bob Odenkirk.The emotional impact of this film really hit me towards the end, and certain factors are very predominant in the movie that you definitely do not expect. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say take away a lot of the laughs you were expecting, and brace yourself for the feels and a very serious tone. This may damper some who came for this because it's from the dudes who did 500 Days of Summer, but It's still very good and the movie is actually funny in the spots it wants to be.Overall, I think this is absolutely a film you want to see. Where the story goes widens the appeal of this movie by far in my opinion, so if you were just not going to see it or judged it by the trailers, don't. Give it a shot.",The Spectacular Now
153,jack-reddan,Spectacular?,6,23 February 2014,"The Spectacular Now harks back to the writers' early film 500 Days of Summer although the similarities are overwhelming and progression and innovation appear to be lacking. The Spectacular Now is a feel good summer romance indie that while poignant fails to get out of 1st gear. Sutter, our male lead, is an archetypal Byronic hero. Witty, outgoing and charming he is haunted by his fathers desertion and adopts a fatalistic worldview. Aimee(female lead) is a stereotypical nice girl. Demure, bashful and insulated we find her also without a father and is oppressed by a tyrant mother. Sutter and Aimee's relationship is sweet and authentic but I feel I've seen it all before(perhaps I'm not the target market). I'm not sure if I've been sullied by over stimulating Hollywood blockbusters but this movie really lacked oomph! I get that it's an indie and it's supposed to understated, poignant and believable. The movie was all these things. However, I found it to be sedate with me barely batting an eye lid during the films climax. I found Sutter's drinking an unnecessary, annoying motif(we get he has daddy issues). I also found Aimee's irrationality displayed during the car scene bizarre and felt that it diminished the film's believability. I was also left bemused at the 'live in the now' ethos(hint: it ain't crazy spontaneous to go to a stuffy dinner with only ten minutes notice). Now despite what I have said the movie was still well executed with very solid acting throughout. There is value in the story with some poignant moments and an uplifting conclusion. It's just that these feel good movies aren't my cup of tea, watchable yes, but just a little plodding for my liking.",The Spectacular Now

Any person that wants to call this a cliché apparently didn't go to high-school. The mentality, the way of thinking, is just so spot on. Breathtaking performances by Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley. These two are really the new up-and-coming talent of the day. For this day and age, this is the realism, this is youth culture, this is what is going on. Potrrayed in a manner that really tears at you. Just a beautiful film. Easily the best romance of the summer, the best romance I've seen in theaters in a long while. Easily the best coming of age story i've seen in some time as well.",The Spectacular Now

Starring the contemporary Hollywood pretty boy and his female counterpart. It shamelessly utilizes over-used movie tropes to prey on teenage girls' desires to see their dream relationship acted out on screen. The the skill to write teenage dialogue is as elusive to it's forty-something screenplay writer as six figure income is for a Fine Arts graduate. There's a scene where they make out in the rain. 
This movie has none of that. Teller kills it. The scenes with young people aren't a conversation cringefest. There's actually a theme and allegory. The pacing is good, the writing is surprisingly very well done. This is actually a pretty good movie.

158,pint_sized_one,Unapologetically romantic and refreshingly discerning,9,15 September 2014,"You may not know it yet, but this is the romantic film you've been waiting to see.The Spectacular Now does cover old ground - bad boy meets good girl. But don't be fooled into thinking this film is straightforward. They may be in high school, but our heroes Sutter and Aimee have experienced enough to know that life isn't always easy. They're intelligent. Cynical, even. Below his joviality and her quiet pragmatism, these high school sweethearts know that there's nothing simple about growing up.Think Freaks and Geeks meets Say Anything, but with less plaid and more drinking.The film's screenplay was included in 2009's Black List (a list of the most popular unproduced scripts circulating Hollywood, compiled each year and voted on by industry professionals). The pace is gentle, the characters are closely drawn, and the dialogue is sharp and funny. The film's melancholy charm is heightened by its beautiful cinematography, which was designed by the same woman responsible for the dreamy aesthetic of films like Son of Rambow and Brideshead Revisited.The excellent script is also bought to life by a top-rate cast. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley have graced just about every ""30 under 30"" list this side of 2013, and both have gone on to dominate the young Hollywood scene. So, too, have supporting cast members Brie Larson (Short Term 12, Scott Pilgrim) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (A.C.O.D, Scott Pilgrim). With a cast like that, it's hard to go wrong.Written by the team behind 500 Days of Summer, this film is unapologetically romantic and refreshingly discerning. Perfect for rainy day viewing.",The Spectacular Now
159,monkyman347,The Spectacular Now is a brilliant coming-of-age drama,9,19 August 2013,"Coming-of-age stories are often given a bad reputation for being overly nostalgic and predictable, but James Ponsoldt's new drama The Spectacular Now challenges this assumption by being an unsentimental and honest look at first love and growing up. It transcends any and all clichés associated with teen dramas while also packing an emotional punch, and feels incredibly real.Sutter Keely (Miles Teller), is a jovial 18 year-old alcoholic who lives for the moment. He's the life of every party, but he's wildly irresponsible and his behavior borders on selfish and narcissistic. After breaking up with his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson), Sutter gets drunk trying to meet girls at a bar, and is found passed out on a stranger's lawn by Aimee Finnecky (Shailene Woodley) the following morning.Aimee is everything Sutter is not: sweet, modest, and ambitious. She's beautiful and friendly, but unlike Sutter she's never been in a relationship before. The two become friends, and gradually fall in love with each other, but this doesn't play out like the typical teen drama. The Spectacular Now openly defies formula and predictability, carving out its own little niche in the genre.The movie is unique to say the least, but more importantly it's intelligent and insightful. It depicts adolescence with both affection and harsh honesty, and doesn't shy away from painful subjects like alcoholism or divorce. In fact, it delves deeply into these issues and explores their effects on each character, especially as Sutter is forced to come to terms with his alcoholic behavior and estranged father.Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley each give near-perfect performances, and their chemistry together is astonishing. Woodley's Aimee is played with such innocence and kindness that it's hard not to fall in love with her character. Woodley previously starred in the ABC Family TV series The Secret Life of the American Teenager as well as the 2011 drama The Descendants, but her role as Aimee is by far her best yet.Teller is equally fantastic and gives an element of warmth and sympathy to what would have otherwise been a shallow and obnoxious character. He has previously played characters in Project X and 21 and Over, but until now has never been given a role that demonstrates the full extent of his acting abilities. His performance as Sutter Keely proves that he is more than capable of handling challenging parts.The script, written by the same pair who penned (500) Days of Summer, incorporates humor and heartbreak in equal measure. Based on the critically acclaimed novel of the same name by Tim Tharp, it condenses the events of the book into a 95-minute movie without sacrificing any of its emotion or charm.The Spectacular Now exceeds expectations and delivers on all fronts, with extraordinary performances from Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, along with a compassionate and truthful script. It's an all too common trend for coming-of-age movies to be melodramatic and formulaic, but The Spectacular Now is the rare movie that captures the ups and downs of adolescence in a refreshingly original way without sugarcoating it.",The Spectacular Now
160,claudiatroglia,Not so spectacular,4,9 July 2015,"I really can't see why everyone seems so crazy about this film. It was depressing, at best. The performances were OK, specially Miles Teller's. Shailene Woodley is cute and sweet, but I'm not sure she can act. It didn't help that the characters (except for Aimee, Shailene Woodley's character) were really unlikable. I hated Sutter (Miles Teller) and I couldn't have cared less what happened to him. Why should we like him? Because his mom tells us that he has done some nice things off screen to a bunch of characters we haven't even met? So we should take her word that he's nice, because it really doesn't transpire. ""What is a nice gift for a girl? A hip flask, off course."" Forget college, kid, start attending AA meetings instead. Another big problem is the script. The dialogs are supposed to be witty teenage talk; well, they were neither witty nor teenage like. It sounded too adult and boring. Every scene seemed forced, artificial and sometimes painful to watch.The sex scene was long and uncomfortable and I would have loved to ask those two kids what the hell they were laughing at. And that car accident scene! The only good thing about it was that at least it was the only unpredictable thing in the whole film.

It's almost Friday and I'm still thinking about it. Personally, that's a sign that something inside me was triggered emotionally and left me wondering why and wanting more. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley were absolutely excellent in their roles of personifying real life tribulations that high school teens go through that not many people realize. Every emotion was raw and honest and really resonated with you throughout the film. Sutter (Teller) is a troubled high school senior who ponders the demise of his parent's relationship while proudly living ""in the now."" He falls in love with a quiet and sweet girl named Aimee (Woodley) who he at first denies his feelings for but comes to realize his true emotions for her and for his situation with his parents that carries you all the way to the end of the movie.

About the sex scene which came out of nowhere, just as this transition: What were the director's thinking? Whatever happened to hugging and shaking hands, like normal people? Another weird thing was the music. Happy tunes in sad moments (like at the funeral scene), and sad tunes when I was expecting some happier music.

It's something we as a culture often over look and or a problem we feel will go away with time. But sometimes bad things happen that can never be erased. The Spectacular Now is a very realistic interpretation of teen relationships. Relationships with each other and the complicated relationships with parents. It's a heartfelt drama and although it's not a perfect film, nor should it be it's a very effective and very well done film. The acting is superb and the story is extremely relevant and powerful. Most films about high school feel the need to result to humor, to critique the obvious popular kids versus the uncool kids. While the Speculator Now is aware of these plot devices it definitely takes these elements to the next level and puts them in a very believable space.

How much can a teenager drunk-drive before he dies? That's the only genuinely interesting question this film even attempts to answer, but it falls short because I rated this a 4 before waiting for that fatal accident and it didn't come so I bumped this down to a 3. There's no way he can still be alive. This film is cutting it too close to fantasy, except with none of the genre's mystique and allure. Just another white high-school boy who treats everyone like dirt and still breezes through life. How is this same story still being rehashed and fed to us again and again? Who's even paying for the production of this nonsense? Can we, like, stop? Have we really run out of stories to tell? Don't drink and drive, kids, and don't watch this movie. Write your own.

Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller had a genuine connection. I also appreciated the simplicity of meaningless conversations and, rambling, and awkward interactions because that is true to the coming-of-age reality.Where it falls to be unrealistic and unrelatable is in the plot. We see so much talking and not enough doing. I'm confused as to the direction of the film. We begin with a brief investigation of Sutter finding himself, then focus in on the romance and family complications, and then shift attention back to Sutter as he reflects on himself and growth in his college essay. What is the spectacular now? We don't see the supposed growth of Sutter until he tells us so in his essay.Something just didn't feel right about this movie.

How a person gets hooked by the under appreciated sparks of life.What is more subtle than demonstrating the feeling of being lost in the allegory of being a teenage and overcoming your inheritance.Miles Teller (Sutter) plays very well the role of the confident teenager but slowly his doubts about himself make him feel lost. Even though he does not care about himself at the beginning when this naive girl enters his life he begins to realize life is serious...Shailene Woodley (Aimee) makes a brilliant job even tough her role is a cliché.

176,deetro,A First of its Kind,10,13 November 2013,"While many people will focus this movie on being a ""teen"" drama or high school picture, it actually goes much deeper than that. It is a first at being an insightful exploration into the (yes complex) world of male emotion. I say that because in at least the last few decades men are depicted as simpleton oafs that share the same emotional complexity as a cardboard box. Well that's not the case and this movie outlines it beautifully. The story begins by taking you down a path where obvious train wrecks are about to happen. This keeps you on the edge of your seat because it painfully and realistically relives touchy social situations we have all been through. While at first it's obvious your depiction of Sutter will change you're not quite sure how -- and in the end I was somewhat surprised being able to relate where ""things in life"" go wrong by being forced to look at my own personal fear and how testosterone provides men with a harsher coping mechanism that is most often misunderstood. Another great success of this film is how it illustrates cause and effect by intimately immersing you in the effect, then slowly taking you back through the familiar causes where things go wrong beginning in childhood. While I'm no psychotherapist I would suspect this would be beautifully received by all those in the field, hopefully opening eyes to what is truly important, this spectacular now.",The Spectacular Now
177,ajcomputer2003,Spectacular does not begin to describe The Spectacular Now.,8,19 December 2013,"Having read the book prior to watching The Spectacular Now, I, obviously, already knew what to expect from the it, as regards to its plot. Little did I know that by the end of the hour-and-a-half movie, all those expectations wouldn't even matter; The Spectacular Now has transcended the 'spectacular' boundary and made a name for itself. But let's put the good stuff aside first. As much as I absolutely adore it, there are still a few imperfections that came alongside the perfections (of course, how would we know the perfections if we don't know their contradictions, right?). For one, the transitions were a bit off. They made the movie a whole lot fast-paced than it's supposed to be - like first you'll see Miles Teller walking down the halls, then in the next frame, he'll be laughing with Shai, and we don't know even know the reason why they're laughing. It kind of made things pretty vague. My second problem with the movie is that it was too short, but that's just me being subjective. Now let's get to the good stuff. I would like to commend Miles Teller for being a brilliant actor. He's a real definition of an actor: he doesn't need lines to let the audience know what Sutter is thinking, (more importantly) what Sutter is feeling. His eyes talk with his mouth as if they're two identical entities that can't be separated, or else, the whole point of acting will just be wasted. If there will ever come a time when you'll cry over the movie - and I'm sure you will - it will be because of him. Meanwhile, character development was most evident in Aimee, and it's all thanks to Shailene Woodley's expected brilliant acting. This duo undoubtedly gives hope to the future of filmmaking. Finally, I think the whole family of Sutter should be given credit for their performance. Those three - Jennifer Jason Leigh, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Kyle Chandler - were in the movie for a mere few minutes, but don't underestimate those few minutes, because it was in those moments wherein I mostly spent time crying over The Spectacular Now. I bet the fact that The Spectacular Now and (500) Days of Summer have the same writers provided some sort of expectations for the viewers because of how insanely good the latter is, but The Spectacular Now has a different story, a different attack towards the audience, and it's that attack - that script and directing - that made it even more lovable. One of the quotes that I absolutely loved goes along the line, ""It's fine to just live in the Now, but the best part of Now is there's another one tomorrow, and I'm gonna start making them count."" But do you know what my favorite thing is about this movie? It's the ending. I absolutely loved it. Albeit I guessed the ending right, I was still impressed by how it was done. No words. Just looks. It's so good. I don't understand how it is underrated. A must-watch for all. Definitely.",The Spectacular Now
178,mycatserena,One of the good ones,7,30 December 2013,"Compared to other movie adaptations of teen novels, this is one of the good ones. It stayed true to the book, maybe with a slight alternate ending, but it didn't deviate from the plot. I felt Teller portrayed Sutter very well and both the main leads' acting felt genuine and believable. The story isn't a predictable one, sure you have a stunning Woodley playing a girl who hasn't ever had a boyfriend, a part that was hard to believe. However, from how Woodley portrays Aimee, the typical nice girl, you can understand from Aimee's character and personality why she hasn't. I wish the movie would have added a bit more of how much Aimee changed because of Sutter, and some of the negative changes too, something that the book focuses a lot more on. I suggest to those planning on watching this to read the book as well, as I found that I got to know the characters a lot better from reading it. If you're up for a feel-good, light comedy with predictable movie romance formula, this probably isn't that type of flick. I'd call this a more coming-of-age film which definitely has a Say Anything and Kings of Summer vibe, and if you liked The Spectacular Now then I would definitely watch those movies.",The Spectacular Now
179,ceceangel456-425-230614,Insightful,8,15 March 2014,"As a kid getting ready to be shipped off to a University in the summer, this movie spoke to me in words I can't even describe. Yes, Sutter's a complicated character that complicates the audience's situation in whether to hate him or love hi to bits. In the end I could completely understand where he came from as a senior unsure of what to do in a life that just keeps getting harder. Why make such a hard decision? Every word he spoke of in the end was like everything I've dealt with for the past six months. The same can go for Aimee, who's innocence seems to make her dreams limitless, like the meek insight of a child. Some see it as a weakness, but I really believe that some people should be more like her.There were a few scenes I really didn't like, but all in all, I'm not sure how other people took this movie, but for me this has touched a really personal level and makes me realize that it's okay to accept the unknown of that new life, so long as you're not afraid of where it takes you.

181,xfy1217,the forceful relationship made me sick,3,21 December 2013,"Spoilers Alert! Please stop reading if if you are not prepared for that.I only voted it for 3 because the forceful relationship made me so sick! Although the lines were good, and the actors did a good job, the awkward and unnatural emotions between characters were way uncool. First of all, when Sutter met his father, it was like he had been known him for a long time. He didn't even need to take time to think that how a 'dad 'that he had never seen for 17 years would be like. He just called 'dad' to whoever opened the door.Second,everyone knows Sutter had never felt a thing for Aimee. It didn't add up that he went to see Aimee in the end instead of Cassidy who he had been missing days and nights. All he wanted was giving Aimee a 'boyfriend experience'.So he got back with Aimee only because he wanted to make up for the accident he caused? Not to mention the supper award sex they had. There was nothing to say, only awkward laughter. What's the difference between that and making out with a hooker? and what's the point to depict that for like 5 mins?Maybe the reason why those emotions seem so unnatural and confusing is that they happened between teenagers. However, Sutter, as a confident, charming, and funny guy as the movie was trying to portray, the decision he made and the emotion he showed were beyond reasonable.",The Spectacular Now
182,smholtzmann,Uhhh,3,25 July 2018,I'm just mad that this movie has a 7.1 rating when it wasn't even that spectacular. I think Miles and Shailene are AMAZING actors and that's probably the only reason it got that high of a rating. This movie just doesn't make sense. The entire movie makes it seem like Miles's character doesn't like (in a romantic way) Shailenes character but at the end he moves to Philly with her. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!

A combination of great acting, accurate representations of high school and the dilemmas of fast approaching adulthood combine to create a movie that the audience can find them themselves immersed in immediately. It manages this all in a pleasantly short run time of 90 minutes, saying all that was needed, no more and no less. Really feel like people do not get the most out of this movie when only focusing on the developing alcoholism of the main character and not the confrontation of his delusions.

The thoughts and emotions started and I just couldn't stop watching it. Only romantic movie(and this one isn't even that committed to romance) that changed my look to that side of life is The Spectacular Now.

Other than that I loved the Picture, the lead characters had unusual problems that went in unusual directions, acting was excellent, casting across the board was excellent - I think we have seen the beginnings of some major careers. The Picture could have lost about 10 minutes of redundant scenes that didn't deepen our understanding of the characters, but that could probably said of every picture out there.",The Spectacular Now

187,ericolson-82318,A great film,8,13 May 2019,"This movie beautifully captures the teenage experience. Everything from the cinematography, to the realistic dialogue, to the superb performance by Miles Teller, to the fitting soundtrack, all made this movie a simple yet captivating experience to watch. At no point of my viewing did I feel like the movie was dragging or too boring. It wastes no time in successfully making you care about the characters and consistently keeps you interested in the development of the plot.
One of the main criticisms I've heard from others is the protagonist, Sutter, doesn't develop as a character and change his ways by the end of the movie, but I disagree. It's true that we never see him come around and stop his destructive habits, but I don't think it needed to be shown. Allow me to explain:Sutter ends up meeting his father and sees why his sister and mother wish that he does not go to visit him. Sutter's father shows how much he really doesn't care 'about being a family man' by not remembering anything about his son other than that he played baseball. More-so, he does not return to his house after 'dropping his girlfriend off at her house'. Sutter doesn't want to end up like him but believes that he already embodies the main characteristics of his father due to his abuse of alcohol at such a young age. Sutter fears he is sharing these habits with his girlfriend Aimee and, if he ends up anything like his dad, will be no good for her.After going through all this and showing his vulnerability by crying with his mother and stating that 'no one loves him' even though he's one of the most charismatic and charming people at his school. This scene was really powerful and shows that, inside, Sutter isn't truly the confident person who lives in the now and never gets down. He even admits to his boss, someone he admires and respects, that he has a problem.At the end of the film, during the monologue of him submitting his college essay, he regales how it's not too late for him to change. And through the final scene of him meeting Aimee (who left alone to attend college in Philadelphia) the audience understands: Sutter knows he can change, and realizes the important things in life to him.So, in all, I would give this movie a watch. Even if you're not a fan of romance films, chances are you'll get something out of this movie. That's the magic of cinema after all, portraying emotions through a screen; and this movie does that very well.",The Spectacular Now

One of the things I also liked about it was that everything appeared to be real - what Miles and Shailene had been through in their relationship and families. And once again Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber proved that just like 500 days of Summer, a movie doesn't have to have a ""lived happily ever after"" to be a happy and satisfying ending. Still, it's a great movie to watch. It's not perfect, and has a few little things with the alcohol element to the film that felt out of place but its real and honest and that's so rare to find in a teenage story like this",The Spectacular Now

She struggles but accepts invitation and tries to help him. He struggles even more than she does especially with dependency and losing his father. Emotion..Love and dependency.

Real and raw, it hits you, and hits you hard.",9,22 December 2013,"First of all i should say that Miles Teller and Shailenne Woodley are the life and soul of the movie, and both give amazing performances, and it comes as no surprise they both received performance awards at Sundance.That being said, what i loved here, what compelled me to come and write my first review here on IMDb, was that unlike any other high-school/college romance The Spectacular Now looks real, from beginning to end, the dialogs, the characters, the relation ships, everything really! It just feels real! And that's how it catche's you, how it makes you care so much for the main characters despite their flaws and mistakes. It could be you, hell, maybe it has been you! And even if if you can't relate at a 100%, at some point i'll bet that some strong and uneasy feeling of dejá vu, will come along, that and some real strong nostalgia! I won't get into much details, but the main plot is hard-partying, easy going, carpe diem Sutter (Miles Teller)fortuitously meets shy, insecure, and responsible Aimee. Not a match made in heaven, sure, but unlikely yet endearing romance does strike and grow. The rest is a small precious masterpiece of a indie film unlike any other this year! It makes you question why on earth did you wanted to grow up, but more importantly, why did you. And for what. It's good to be reminded of that i guess...Don't miss it.

The book is so amazing and if you have to choose between reading the book or watching the movie, definitely go with the book. Obviously they had to cut a lot out so that it doesn't drag on but they left out some key story aspects that totally changed the tone of the story and left some in that didn't matter as much. The part that bothered me the most was the ending, which they decided to make a happy ending. The book ends in a depressing way which seems more realistic and had more of an impact.

As well as the interaction by Marcus (Dayo Okeniyi) and also the lovable/despicable character that is Sutter.An absolute passionately heartfelt, work by everyone involved overall.",The Spectacular Now
195,samuelbmichel,A teenage movie that rises above all others,9,21 August 2013,"The Spectacular Now manages to do something nearly impossible: it tells the story of two high school students navigating the complexities of young adulthood without every feeling forced. Where so many movies fall victim to typical clichés, The Spectacular Now rises above it to tell a beautiful story that just happens to have the most heart of any film I've seen this year.The story is fairly traditional: Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) is the cool high school senior. At a time when most of his peers are concerned about getting into college, Sutter would rather be drinking and living in the 'now', as he calls it. After getting dumped by his girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson), Sutter winds up hungover on the lawn of Amie Finicky (Shailene Woodley). What starts as a nice friendship between two people who share some commonalities (her father is dead, his left) becomes a romance that genuinely feels real. Part of what makes The Spectacular Now so real is that every character is so well developed, even those who are only briefly on-screen. Sutter doesn't use his popularity to hurt others, rather he is a fun-loving guy who enjoys making jokes and doesn't take himself seriously. Amie isn't an ugly duckling by any means, but her beauty is hidden under her long hair and her obsession with science fiction books. Their interactions feel largely improvised because much of their dialogue is filled with 'um' and laughter. In short, they're teenagers.In praising the natural feel of The Spectacular Now, credit goes to director James Ponsoldt for getting such genuine performances out of his actors. Teller and Woodley are absolutely phenomenal as two people who wouldn't be naturally drawn to each other but their relationship makes sense when you see them together. Even the supporting roles are filled with gems. Brie Larson takes the role of the Sutter's ex-girlfriend to new levels by portraying her as someone looking for something more than good times. Jennifer Jason Leigh comes in and out as Sutter's mother but her heart-to-heart with her son near the end of the film brought most of the audience in my theater to tears. Kyle Chandler, most often recognized for playing the moral, upstanding father/coach on Friday Night Lights, takes a drastic (but nonetheless very impressive) turn as Sutter's deadbeat, alcoholic dad. Sutter's brief scene with his father offers him a glimpse into what his life might become if he continues down his current path.Ponsoldt never beats the theme of alcoholism to death. Yes, Sutter drinks and yes it has negative effects on his relationship with people around him (most notably Amie). But Sutter mainly uses drinking as a vessel to be a fun person. It doesn't take a big speech about the dangers of alcoholism to convince him to change his ways, rather it's the look of disappointment and sadness on his face when interacting with his father, a man he idolized. I have no doubt that The Spectacular Now will go in the books as one of the best coming-of-age films of all time in large part because of its phenomenal dialogue and great performances. See this movie.",The Spectacular Now
196,andrewmcdonald-130-691074,Spot-tacular Now,2,16 October 2014,I can't express how remarkably disappointed I was in the make-up department if there was one at all? In the age of the High-Definition TV seeing acne on our potential future A-listers was an absolute atrocity. Was there no room on the budget for the Avon lady? I'm sure the producers will insist that this was not an oversight but a calculated effort to bring a gritty (or should I say grotty) realism to the screen but imagine the horror when hordes of punters riding high on the coattails of The Whip In Our Lashes stumble upon this little known masterwork of casting direction only to be stripped and burned like an untested make up remover in a Sephora sale bin. I see these two clearly weren't repulsed enough by one another as they agreed to withstand their crater faces once more in Divergent. The most evident divergent between the two is the make-up team of twenty-three strong verses Spectacular Now's dismal four - who let's be honest were drinking from the same flask as Sutter. The word Spectacular arouses something beautiful and eye-caching however the only spectacle this eye caught was the years of shame and disgrace as the two young Hollywood hopefuls remain ensnared in a time-capsule of irritated-skinned terror called Spectacular Now. Their stars may rise but it's a slippery slope when your slippery face is no longer a secret in Hollywood.

197,lsurocks4,What...?,1,14 November 2014,"The Spectacular Now is supposed to be a tender, relatable, coming of age love story- some reviews have even gone as far as saying that it should be a required view in all High Schools. However, we think not. To quickly summarize the movie so that you won't waste your time watching it- Boy has ego problems. Boy breaks up with hot girlfriend. Boy meets random new (implied to be slightly smart) girl after waking up hungover and confused on stranger's lawn. Boy uses this girl to get back at ex girlfriend. We guess boy asked girl to be girlfriend (I mean they sleep together) Boy asks girl to prom, while drunk. Girl says yes, while drunk. Boy and girl both go to prom drunk. Both end up with a drinking problem. Girl getting this drinking problem from boy. Boy becomes emotionally unstable after meeting jerk drunk dad, while being drunk himself, and screams at girl to get out of his car (while on a highway). While exiting car and crying for forgiveness, girl gets hit by bus. THE END. nnooo sorry- we wish- instead- girl miraculously survives. Boy feels guilty over hurting girl and they decide to forget about what happened (wow great way to maintain a relationship). Slightly blurry about what happens next but- Boy doesn't graduate and is pretty much a drunk failure- decides to abandon girl at bus station- goes instead to get drunk, deciding to write his 6-month-late college application essay over cliché teenage dreams that he thinks will magically get him accepted. Boy then shows up with girl's jacket at her college. That is how the movie ends. Roll Credits. (note: all ""Boy""(s) are Sutter Keely and ""Girl""(s) are Aimee Finnickey- the characters from the film) We hope you enjoyed this review as much as we did writing it. and please save yourself the torture of wasting 1 hour 37 minutes of your life :)",The Spectacular Now

199,robertmarns,An unexpected heart warmer.,9,2 February 2014,"I haven't seen a film like this in a long time. Usually this genre of films fall short of your expectations and fail to get the viewer to invest in the characters. This is an exception. It brings you along with the characters from the beginning all the way until the end. You don't expect to be challenged by a film like this, but you leave wanting more and with many questions. I would say that this is one of the best feel good films I've watched, about the role that friendship and love plays in accepting ourselves and moving forward. Shailene Woodley was really very good, I hope to see more of her in films, as she was totally believable and natural. I suggest that everyone sees this film, you will throughly enjoy!",The Spectacular Now
200,rory_gooderick,A very special film,9,24 July 2017,"I really wasn't expecting a huge amount from this film at all, after all the ""popular guy falls for quiet, studious girl"" has been played out a number of times, all to fairly similar and formulaic results. However this film has a different feel to it. Firstly the acting is great; Miles Teller plays the cocky, 'confidence masking his insecurities' role absolutely perfectly. As for Shailene Woodley, she plays the quiet girl brilliantly and does so with intelligence and dignity. The direction doesn't make her ever grovel for the popular guy's attention, or change herself for him - if it does then its only in the subtlest of ways. Another stand out aspect of the film is the attention to the smaller roles, notably Sutter's father, and the owner of the shop that Sutter works in (Bob Odenkirk). Both are posed as polar opposite characters - shown in an exchange near the end of the film when Sutter quits his job at the shop. There's this real feel of a small town in the movie in which they all live, which seems almost claustrophobic and you just want the characters to escape and break free. Overall this is just a lovely film, and honestly one of the best 'coming of age' films of its kind I think I've ever seen. Just watch it. You'll be moved.",The Spectacular Now
201,noxatron,Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,5,3 February 2014,"I watched this high with my friend and we were astounded by how utterly mediocre it was. The casting was shoddy (seriously, Miles Teller was the best jock they could find?), the delivery was awkward at the best of times and the entire film seemed to attempt with all of it's will to be as utterly cliché as possible. I can understand the appeal for someone to want to simply zone out and watch some mindless romance, but I can't understand the 7+ IMDb rating. I felt a real lack of genuine acting throughout which made it extremely difficult to sympathize with the characters. Regardless, this film will serve fine as a family movie or something to watch with your less-than-romantic/intelligent girlfriend.

202,bengantz,Smells Like Teen Spirit,10,31 July 2013,"I was lucky enough to see The Spectacular Now at an advance screening, and walking out, I had the unmistakable feeling that I can only describe as a ""good movie buzz."" You feel a little light on your feet. You're thinking not only about what you've just seen, but how it relates to you. It's a heartfelt story that distills all of the beauty, tenderness, and apocalyptic bleakness of youth into a 95 minute love story that portrays teenagers in the most honest way since the films of John Hughes. The Spectacular Now won Sundance's special jury prize for acting and within minutes, the reason for this becomes apparent. Beautiful, naturalistic performances all around. Miles Teller portrays Sutter Keely with charisma and an effervescent charm while Shailene Woodley imbues Aimee Finicky with a tender shyness that makes her character incredibly endearing. When you watch the two of them on screen together, their chemistry is not just apparent, it's intoxicating. And it's not just a movie held together by its performances. Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber have written an incredible screenplay with flawed yet likable characters you can't help but root for, and James Ponsoldt has delicately directed the script to make his best movie to date. The Spectacular Now is much more than another indie darling. It has breathed life into the ""teen movie"" genre by treating its characters with maturity and honesty.

A movie about a male, teenage alcoholic who drinks his way through the movie (including classes, work, social life), gives up the big breasted girlfriend for the wall flower and proceeds to turn her into a high school flask toter is not worth the time it takes to park outside the theater.

It was slow, the characters weren't developed well, the viewer couldn't feel the story because there was actually not much of a story... It was supposed to be heartbreaking and sad, but instead it only made me wonder, if that is the reality of an American teenager.Everything's so much exaggerated that it started to annoy me, too much drama for nothing.

206,dirtesq,"Spectacular Moments, But Also Flawed",6,22 September 2013,"The Spectacular Now is a film with great potential that is ultimately unfulfilled. The acting is excellent, especially Shailene Woodley's performance as Aimee, and there are moments that are truly exceptional. The scene where Sutter (played by Miles Teller) and Aimee are throwing newspapers together shortly after meeting feels genuine and provides a believable premise for how these two very different people begin to develop a bond. And the lovemaking scene between them is a wonderfully genuine and poignant depiction of the awkward but tender side of teenage sexuality, free from the typical gratuitous nudity or crude jokes.The film has major shortcomings, though. Too much is told rather than being shown, and Sutter's character never really seems to grow. We are told at the end of the film as he is rewriting his college essay that he now suddenly gets it all and intends to change, but he also quits his job because he can't promise not to come to work ""loaded"" and crashes his car into his own mailbox while driving drunk shortly before he has this supposed breakthrough. The scene where his mother is telling him how different he is from his father and how he has such a big heart would ring a lot truer if we had seen some of this heart during the preceding 90 minutes of the film. Instead, we are left with his mother telling us at the end of the film about the kind and generous things he did in the third grade instead of being able to witness any sort of similar kindness and generosity in Sutter's behavior. It would take a miraculous leap for the viewer to believe Sutter has really changed to any material extent when he shows up at Aimee's college at the end of the film.Shailene Woodley's Aimee is genuine and lovable, but the viewer can't help but feel she is being sucked into Sutter's destructive and self-centered world and worry for her for the consequences. Aimee's mother supposedly wants to hold her back from leaving home and going to college, even though we never meet this mother and never see the dynamic of this relationship. Perhaps the one arguably positive thing Sutter does for Aimee in the entire story is to encourage her to stand up to her mother about going to college and pursuing her own life, but again, we never see any of this transpire and are only told what happens.There were several lost opportunities in the film to show the audience growth in Sutter's character that would have been much more effective than his telling us in his essay. If the filmmakers really want the audience to believe Sutter has learned something and grown in a meaningful way, some indication that he had acknowledged and was prepared to address his alcoholism is critical. And if we are to believe that he actually loves Aimee, and not just that she is his next best girlfriend option for now after being dumped by Cassidy, we needed to see him demonstrate that love by something more than just giving her a hip flask or showing up at her college at the end. Overall, the film is not an unpleasant experience, and the performances are quite good, but one can't help but feel there was a lost opportunity here for this film to be much more than it is.",The Spectacular Now

The development of Aimee's character was endearing to watch and as a viewer you were almost able to grow with her through out the film. Shailene Woodley brings a lot to this role without trying to hard to oversimplify the sweet girl image that comes across when we first me Aimee. Sutter's character is raw and realistic, his vulnerability makes him relatable and all the more lovable.

And I am happy I did, because it is such a great movie. I'm 17 and it really relates to the life of an average high schooler. Sutter was such a great character. He had a personality that grasps peoples attention. And makes them instantly fall in love with him. And then Aimee, the average geeky girl, who was shy but great when you get to know her. Her personality worked with Sutter's to make them balance each other out. The movie takes place in a small town high school, just a few weeks before graduation. Sutter the cool popular guy meets the shy virgin geek Aimee. They begin to talk and realize that even though they have differences, they have a lot of similarities. And they slowly but surely fall in love. Which makes this movie interesting. Throughout this movie you see Aimee progress, into a totally different person.After Sutter takes Aimee's virginity, they talk about their future, which are both totally different from each other. They end up going to prom together, and soon after that is where I believe this movie started moving downhill. Sutter and Aimee go to visit his father who left him years before. When they get to his fathers house his father appears to be a drunk. They go to a bar, where he and his dad get to know each other. And before you know it his dad abandons them, leaving him to pay for the tab. So Sutter and Aimee leave. On the way home from his dads they get in a fight, causing Aimee to get out of the car and end up getting hit. Which I was not expecting at all. A few scenes later they graduate, and plan to leave to go to Philly together. But of course Sutter who is starting to turn out like his father abandons Aimee. Weeks later Sutter starts to get his act together and applies to a college, and goes to search for Aimee. Then he finds her, and thats the end! So a great idea, and a great start, but a horrible ending. If the ending was better and the last 20 minutes was better, then this movie would've received a 10 out of 10.",The Spectacular Now
210,feckingaround,Not really sure what to say about this...,2,2 January 2014,"***maybe spoilers***Hi,Um, bit drunk but I just watched this film and I must say I'm appalled.The film concept and acting were themselves good, but I couldn't understand at all how the idea of people drinking and driving was not only glossed over but tied in with viewers understanding of the characters in a sympathetic/understanding way.The only accident that happened was because the two 'main' characters were drunk and arguing, or maybe just arguing and not paying attention (which it seems more likely from the film?) - That scene however left me a little confused as it seems they ended up after the near miss facing a chain link fence. The next shot shows the girl exiting the car to be hit by 'another car on the road' which could only have been aiming for the chain fence too? ;) The only direct casualty of the whole drink driving, emotional hormone and alcohol roller-coaster of a film seemed to be an innocent mailbox...Overall, I dunno.. as I said.. am drunk.. but I think the writer(s)/director(s) might have missed out the opportunity to slip a valuable message into an otherwise good film.worm.",The Spectacular Now
211,sole-alarcon-c,"great movie, not awesome",6,10 January 2014,"I will say that first I taught that it would be the typical chick flick American movie, and it was, kind off, but then it goes to a different direction, kind of like ""the perks.."" It left you with a cool way of see things, and to think more about them. The actor, at first, I didn't like him, when I saw him on the trailers, but I think that he gives us a great performance, and the producers picked well. I must add that the actress gives the perfect emotion with little effort (we have to watch this girl, she is a natural). The music, great! it was just perfect, at the perfect time. You would not even notice when is there, sutil in a good way. Plus, it gives you like the teenagers perspective of love and life, is good to do some serious reflexion of how those people think. And for them the movie will be like an eye opening. good movie.",The Spectacular Now
212,sgfrkk96,The Feels,10,19 January 2014,"I finally had the opportunity to watch this movie, after months of wanting to. This movie was so amazing, I had the feels the entire movie. The characters' personalities were so perfectly acted out, the actors did an impeccable job or portraying their characters. I felt like they were real people, it was insane how amazingly real it all seemed. The way the movie revolves around Sutter and drowns out school life is very interesting as well. It gives your the perspective that, not in all kids' lives is school the main focus. Sometimes family issues, or mainly in his case, partying and drinking, can draw teens attention. It was also amazing how they connected his dad's personality to Sutter's. They both said the same phrases a lot, and his dad was a drunkard as well. It's evident later in the movie Sutter realizes he will end up the same way. I am honestly at a loss of words, the movie needs to be watched by teenagers worldwide, for a truly heart felt story.",The Spectacular Now

This is a perfect example of a dumb indie film that no one should actually like but because its trendy, people waste their time and money watching it. The characters are not realistic and everything moves so slowly. When the movie ended I literally said ""that was it......."" Don't waste your time watching this one. I normally have respect for even the most out there concepts for movies but this movie literally had no point. No character development. I recommend any other movie besides this.",The Spectacular Now

215,sarah_emmerton,Drama about revelation & finding out about yourself,5,10 February 2014,"Miles Teller is a fantastic actor who I would say walks in the line of a young Vince Vaughan. The Spectacular Now is a teenage drama about self discovery. Its about a young man character who is about to graduate and doesn't really have greater ambition in life and his future. He focuses more on the ""now""and likes to live in the moment, which to most you like to plan and make goals for their future. He meets this girl being on the rebound from his recent girlfriend who in a way helps him open his eyes for the future. There is no defining moment as there are a few which make him realize that tomorrow is another ""now"" and he needs to work on today to make tomorrow better. Overall it was alright but pretty slow. I know it is a drama but a few more comical high school scenes would have made this movie better.",The Spectacular Now
216,kamilaczeczot,Movie about a boy that lives in the now.,7,10 February 2014,Overall the emotion in this movie is portraying very well. Also the storyline kept me interested throughout the whole movie. The only part I didn't like is the boring ending. I think the graphics in the movie were great. The story itself is great considering its based off a book. The actors within the movie are phenomenal. Miles Teller is a must see actor in the role of a boy with drinking problem. Then he meets a girl who is an outsider and the way the director sets them up to meet is great. It is a movie that is away from the typical love story.I would definitely see this movie again and I highly recommend it. This movie is great for teens because it all takes place in a typical life of high school teenagers.,The Spectacular Now
217,molsara,Terrible,1,18 January 2021,"Going forom nowhere to nowhere, bad acting, awkward, cliché... I was reading the reviews, most of them is good, so I suffered through the movie, but it's just boring & not entertaining at all. Don't waste your time with it!",The Spectacular Now
218,farhad_is,A very refreshing view of a real relationships with a real girl,9,11 January 2014,"Personally, this movie was better than all the 80's and 90's coming of age movies like St.elmo's fire, The breakfast club, Pretty in pink, She's all that etc... due to how real it feels. Shailene woodley and miles teller portray two individuals who, while having their own troubles to deal with, are intrinsically good people who are just drifting along with the ebb and flow of life. They make no effort to change and are dealing with their issues in different ways until they meet each other. The audience can feel the chemistry between the two leads on-screen, and being in a loving relationship yourself can help to augment the experience even more due to how real it feels. Shailene woodley is the real star of the show here, (in a role here for which the only other performance I feel comes close is Ione Skye in ""Say anything"" ) she portrays a girl who is such a good person at heart that you end up feeling almost protective of her during the movie. The kind of person she portrays is the kind of person any girl would aspire deep down to be. A deeply caring individual who puts her loved one ahead of herself. Because as we all know, only when you do that, can you truly feel every pang and flutter that comes with love. Do yourself a favour, watch this movie to remember what it feels like to care for someone so much that it hurts, that you put everything on the line for the person for no other reason than the fact that you love them and want to see them happy.",The Spectacular Now
219,englishlover8,What did I just see,1,14 September 2014,"Listen, I have been trying to write a decent review. But I just can't. This movie is just senseless. This pretty much sums up the story: -I have a perfect life, I have a perfect girlfriend. -Baby I didn't cheat on you. -Oh hey sweet and shy girl, let's make the most mainstream couple ever. -OMG you're so special. -OMG I told you to get out of my car! -OMG I'm sorry you were almost killed because of me. -I love you so much I will leave you alone in embarrassment. -I will just send an awesome college application, writing the most mainstream things ever, and I'm totally getting in.I see no story and no character, just moody drunk kids who have no idea what they're doing.

220,jeppehellegers,This movie made me irrationally angry (Spoiler Review),2,11 September 2016,"I get that this movie gets high ratings, I really do. The acting is good, some of the cinematography is really nice and the music is beautiful as well. The problem with this movie is the message. I was constantly waiting for the protagonist to get told what an egotistical asshole he is, but: it doesn't happen. At the end he has this monologue about how he didn't want to get hurt and thought ""living in the moment"" means he never has to grow up, woopdiedoo. Also, people didn't get that the popular protagonist wanted to date Aimee(Shailene Woodley)? She is an incredibly beautiful girl, not really convincing as an intelligent nerdy virgin outcast who reads books I'd say. And yes, that's one of the stereotypes in this film.A movie about a destructive teen with a destructive relationship who drinks and drives, thinks he is the coolest guy ever and would cheat if he had the opportunity. Saying you are afraid of failure, getting hurt and hurting people and pretty much emotion in general doesn't justify ANY of this actions in this movie. This guy should have been morally put in place by the author, but it didn't happen. Much potential, terrible execution.",The Spectacular Now
221,songsfromwilderness,The best teenage movie i'd missed,10,26 August 2016,"I'd watched a not so entertaining Miles Teller movies earlier and I wasn't too excited about The Spectacular Now. But as luck would have it, I happened to stumbled upon this and watched it last night and I am pretty amazed that Teller can pull of such an engaging character.For start the movie is nothing like the tens of teenage movies released every year, i should have know, it got Shailene Woodly in it. The story starts with typical high school movies, parties, booze and girls. But then it slowly turns to a much serious and more realistic approach to a teen life. The Character Shutter although charming and funny on the outside, has a drinking problem and slowly finds himself to be much like his father, who left him and his mom....until she met AimeeAimee Finicky, played by Woodly, is your typical shy and feminine high schooler, bookish, pretty but largely unnoticed. She came into the limelight (or first scene) when she stumbled upon Sutter passed out in her front lawn. She help out Sutter with his studies and in the process got close to him. As the movie progress you slowly find yourself falling in the subtle charm of Aimee. The movie give you a satisfying story of a teen from a modern suburban broken family. Yet with a mix of humor every now and then and left you with a powerful message. Love this movie, one of my all time teen movie. Would recommend, giving 10/10.",The Spectacular Now
222,ayrineclaudya,The best while having your cup of afternoon tea,8,27 November 2016,"A live in the moment boy, Sutter carrying a burden to help his friends to find themselves until it's time for him in return. It makes me think about many things. Coming of age teenager, Sutter and Aimee is portrayed as a different person, but like any other teenager, they are insecure, spontaneous, and have their each problem that consumed their thought and the way they see the world. It's amazing, how one thing called attraction and fond can be such bridge for any different between a boy and a girl. I'm slightly confused though, that Sutter still like his ex, Cassidy, but until last scenes, I realize, that it's just that he felt that Aimee is too good for him. The crying scene between Sutter and his mom also warms my heart, he really this little loving and caring human being. Despite his bitter feeling towards her dad, his nothing like his father. I like this sutter character, I guess we're all having Sutter-self deep in our heart, back when we're young. But then we're moving on like we should be. I'd really love to read the book also!",The Spectacular Now

226,ayeshakashif-01456,This movie was not what i expected,9,11 November 2018,"Hello,
I don't usually write a review on movies but lately I've been watching a lot of ""coming of age"" movies, I've watched the edge of seventeen and I've always searched of similar movies yet nothing good was found. However this movie had directed all the good and the bad parts about growing up about taking time and understanding yourself not always being perfect scoring an A ,
It takes time to accept yourself and understand you can't change certain things but you can always hope for the better change.
You can't always rely on someone you need to rely on that somebody.
This movie is hardly anything related to love it's mostly about a teenage senior boy who's trying to live his life in some ordinary circumstances he chose to live his life the way he wanted to but realized there was so much more than he could grasp.",The Spectacular Now

228,trontur,The Spectacular Indie!,9,24 January 2016,"What a wonderful movie! I enjoyed ""The Spectacular Now"" very much. Great screenplay, based on the book of the same name by Tim Tharp. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are bringing the characters to life in an honest, charming way. As we follow their story we learn about self-delusion and different coping strategies. There are several scenes which moved me and touched me. It could be a new classic teenage movie but a more serious kind of. I am very curious of the next film by the director James Ponsoldt. It will be ""The Circle"", based on the best selling book by Dave Eggers. If you enjoy this movie you could also enjoy ""Two Night Stand"" and ""The Fault in Our Stars"".",The Spectacular Now
229,smilefordeath,Meh,2,1 February 2020,"Positives:
Acting was good in some parts, some of it just felt cheesy and overdone. Most notably, Leigh's. Teller, at parts, was far too stiff. Larson was great, though, and Woodley wasn't bad. Take it as you will.Chemistry was actually okay. The sex scene was awkward and weird, but I liked it. Felt realistic. One of the better scenes.Cinematography and the sets were well-done and made. I loved seeing Teller's character's room and house.Negatives:
Can you stop beating me over the head with your one message? I'm going to get a headache soon from the amount of times that I've heard Teller's character say, ""I just want to live in the moment."" Oh, come on. We get it! We don't need like ten more scenes elaborating on why the statement was wrong.So many complaints about the protagonist. He's supposed to be flawed, I know, but he's such an terrible person that I thought someone would at least tell him off. I was waiting for it. But, no, we get some random ending with ""But I just don't want to be hurt."" Cue the tears. You almost killed your girlfriend and you just left her at the train, only to show up at some school, and you expect to be forgiven? What?The dialogue and writing were unnatural and weird. Woodley's character says ""I got into college"" at some point. That's not how real people talk, students would say the school they got into, not just some random ""Philadelphia."" None of it was how real people talked.The characters felt ""off."" The mother too sweet, the girlfriend too forgiving, the father too unrealistically cruel. Everything was catered to the protagonist to make him look and seem more in character. Woodley's character, Aimee, felt like she was just an innocent person who, for no reason at all, loved this awful guy. Weird and unexplained. The side characters had these random moments, but no given real purpose other than to teach some lesson to the main character. They're not real people, they're just props to beat the audience over with the same message.Cheesiness and unrealisticness. You take presumably months to write one essay? And you base the entire movie off of that one question? He somehow just finds her school at the end, and she's just there? This insta-love and awkward chemistry was formed out of a desire of real love?The casting was bloody awful. Seriously? Teller, who was 25 at the time, was cast to play an attractive, charming 18-year-old. Think about that. Woodley is naturally beautiful, so they're going to put her into the high school stereotype of being the boring virgin nerd? Really? At least Larson's casting was good.",The Spectacular Now
230,dakotazurich,It was...Interesting,4,26 February 2019,"Some words to describe this movie would be interesting and random. I use the word interesting because it encompasses some feelings I felt during the movie. At times I felt really uncomfortable, and not like purposefully and strategically placed cinematography on purpose by the directors, but because the script writing and acting felt very odd sometimes. I felt uncomfortable also because of how I felt about the characters. Cassidy, the ex girlfriend of the main character, had the most uncomfortable and unnatural interactions, and upon studying her dance moves in which they say she's a good dancer, I was like ""no honey she can't dance.""
I also say interesting because a part of me felt intrigued with the whole idea. I think it had a very good message but somehow missed the spot of coming across how they wanted it to. I was less intrigued with the ""live in the now"" message and more intrigued on the character's actions based on how his past had gone. I think it portrayed a really underrated thing in society, is that how you're raised will severely affect your future as a person.
I don't use the word random lightly. Some of the scenes were extremely weird and random and I felt like they didn't add to the movie at all. (Spoiler) at one point the girl gets hit by the car and the next scene I was left absolutely confused. ""Was he arrested for drunk driving? If he was how did he get away with it? Is she in the hospital? Did she die?"" But no all she was left with was a broken arm. I'm certain if a car hits you going 45-70mph you would either be dead or paralyzed. This part of the movie really bothered me.
Another part was the ending. As a person who studies to work in the film industry, I am aware that every good story has a strong beginning, middle, and ending. The ending of this movie could've been very symbolic, however it was not strong at all, it was exactly the opposite.
I believe humans are constantly being shaped and molded and changing, so realistically, the main character would change too. In the movie we see his character development and see that his opinion on his future has changed. But does his opinion on that remain the same? Is he wanting to marry her?
It left me with too many questions, and not in the good way. And can we talk about that college essay? No practical-minded person would write a college essay that way.
Aimee also bothered me a bit. Yes she lost her virginity to him but she didn't need to fall into the relationship so fast. She was always commenting on how much she liked him and how she wanted a future with him and it left me uncomfortable because I knew he didn't feel the same way. It made the plot a bit more interesting but she seemed like a very flat character to me and should've been portrayed differently in my opinion. Maybe that's just because I feel as if the actress has the same acting style in every movie, but that might be because she gets type casted.
Interesting and random, that's for sure.",The Spectacular Now
