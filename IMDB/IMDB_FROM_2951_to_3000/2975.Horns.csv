0,SnoopyStyle,good idea,7,10 January 2017,"Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merrin Williams are deeply in love since their early childhood. After her brutal murder, the town is outraged believing him to be guilty. Even his parents aren't sure. The evidence is against him. After sleeping with barmaid Glenna Shepherd, he wakes up the next morning with horns growing out of his head. Now, people confess to him their darkest thoughts, obey his command, and unleash their hidden desires. He can bring out their memories. He tries to piece together that fateful night and find Merrin's killer.The premise brings out the darkness of humanity. It does struggle to settle on a specific level. It has too much silliness at times which threatens to make the movie a light weight. As for the murder mystery, it seems obvious from early on. There are probably too many hints. This movie has a good idea set up. Radcliffe is a fine lead. It stumbles once in awhile but manages to cross the finish line with plenty in the tank.",Horns
1,claudio_carvalho,Weird and Mesmerizing,7,20 April 2015,"In a small town, Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) is accused by the inhabitants of killing his sweetheart Merrin Williams (Juno Temple). Even his parents believe that he is guilty and only his childhood friend and lawyer Lee Tourneau (Max Minghella) believes Ig is telling the truth. Out of blue, Ig sees horns sprouting on his forehead, but soon he finds that the horns are a blessing since people confess their sins and inner dark desires to him. Ig uses the horns to discover who the killer of his beloved girlfriend is.""Horns"" is a weird and mesmerizing movie that entwines several genres. The plot is unique and anything can happen in this original story. The conclusion could be better but does not totally disappoint. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Amaldiçoado"" (""Cursed"")",Horns
2,nogodnomasters,HARRY POTTER GOES SLYTHERIN,8,20 November 2018,"First I must gives kudos to Keith Bunin (screenplay), Joe Hill (novel) for giving us a film that was different.Iggy Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) is accused of killing his girlfriend Merrin (Juno Temple). The whole town is against him. We are convinced he is not the killer, although we don't know for sure. His childhood friend is defending him as he walks free, wanting to know who is the real killer.Through circumstances Iggy, who drives a Gremlin and listens to David Bowe, grows horns These aren't any horns. They make people around him lose their inhibitions and tell the truth...making his quest to find the real killer a bit easier if not more interesting since Iggy can make devilish suggestions.I liked the little details in the film, the Gremlin, the pitchfork, Bowe, and the biblical license plates (GEN 138, 2036 LUK). I am feeling that I missed a few. The storyline keeps you engaged as we quest for the truth.The film is classified as a drama/fantasy/horror. Worth a view.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Juno Temple).",Horns
3,kosmasp,Coming from the left,8,4 October 2015,"Have to admit, this really took me by surprise. I was expecting more Horror than humor, but it definitely has both of those at least in equal doses. For some it might actually be ""too funny"" (as in too much comedy in it of course). Harry Potter finally grows horns/up! That's what we can take from this.It also seems like a very complicated story at first, with going back and forth and not knowing where this is headed. It's actually pretty simple though and you might figure this out pretty quickly. Maybe not all the details but quite a lot of the story. That should not be an obstacle to enjoyment of the movie, unless you make it so. Otherwise there are quite a few funny ideas and the fact you make a spin (horror version) of ""Liar Liar"" is quite exciting and nice!",Horns
4,gavin6942,Daniel Radcliffe Grows Up,7,13 February 2015,"In the aftermath of his girlfriend's mysterious death, a young man (Daniel Radcliffe) awakens to find strange horns sprouting from his temples.This seems to be a love or hate sort of film. Some people really dislike it, and others quite enjoy it. I tend to agree with those who like it. It is a bit disjointed, and it is hard to tell if it wants to be a dark comedy, a satire, a horror film, a murder mystery...This is a breakout performance by Daniel Radcliffe. He could have been branded for life as ""Harry Potter"" (and to some extent he always will), but here he brings it. An edgy character, full of pee and vinegar. Almost too harsh, perhaps, but still a great departure... a role that will open a lot of new doors for Radcliffe.Worth noting is the score by Robin Coudert, which Aaron VonLupton calls ""undoubtedly beautiful"" and yet ""a bit of a disappointment"". Coudert's work here is good, but not quite as powerful as his work on ""Maniac"".",Horns
5,lee_eisenberg,great horny toads,6,18 January 2015,"Since the Harry Potter series ended, Daniel Radcliffe has been successfully making an effort to break away from the mold. His first post-Harry role was the Hammer flick ""The Woman in Black"", and then he played a college-age Allen Ginsberg in ""Kill Your Darlings"". Now he stars in an adaptation of ""Horns"", by Stephen King's son Joe Hill.* I interpreted this story of a murder suspect who who sprouts horns and develops the ability to make people talk frankly about their past as a reminder that no one totally knows anyone. Or it could simply be a plain old thriller. Whatever the case, I found it one of the year's most interesting movies. It's no masterpiece, but I liked it. A couple of points for Gryffindor, one might say.*Hill is named after the executed labor activist.",Horns
6,jboothmillard,Horns,8,17 November 2014,"The star of Harry Potter has done well for himself escaping into other roles, highlights have included supernatural horror The Woman in Black and rom-com What If, and when I heard of the concept of this film I was excited to see it, directed by Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes, Piranha 3D). Basically small-town DJ Ignatius ""Ig"" Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) was already an outcast in his community, which he didn't mind, but now he is shunned by almost everyone, being the prime suspect of the mysterious murder of his girlfriend Merrin Williams (Killer Joe's Juno Temple). Following his unsuccessful attempt to defend himself, and cursing God, Ig wakes up the next morning to find horns protruding from his forehead, talking to good people it appears they do not notice the horns, but they reveal their darkest secrets, thoughts and feelings in his presence, he goes to the doctor in an attempt to operate on the horns. While under anaesthesia Ig dreams of how he met Merrin, while thirteen years old Ig (Mitchell Kummen) was introduced to Merrin (Sabrina Carpenter) in church by his friend Lee Tourneau (Dylan Schmid), they played alongside him and other friends Eric Hannity (Erik McNamee), Glenna Shepherd (Laine MacNeil) and Ig's brother Terry Perrish (Jared Ager-Foster), Lee repaired Merrin's cross necklace, but Ig trades the necklace for a cherry bomb so he can begin a relationship with Merrin, this bomb later goes off in Lee's hands and puts him in hospital. Back in the present, Ig realises the power of manipulation and influence his horns have and embraces it, he begins his own investigation into Merrin's death to clear his name and discover the true killer, in flashback we see that on the night she was murderer Merrin ended the relationship between them, Ig was left heartbroken and suspicious that she was in love with someone else. Ig confronts Terry (Joe Anderson), and able to read his mind sees that Terry was with Merrin on the night she was killed, following the breakup he drove her in his car, she exited into the woods, he fell asleep waiting for her to return, and waking the next morning finds himself holding a blood- stained rock, he removed any evidence linking him, shocked by this revelations Ig brutally beats Terry, but is arrested by policeman Eric (Michael Adamthwaite), Ig notices snakes following him, he can control them to attack and punish people. The next day Ig tells what has been happening to Lee (Max Minghella, director Anthony's son), now his lawyer, he cannot see Ig's horns and is unaffected by their manipulative influence, Ig notices him wearing Merrin's cross, he rips it off, it was shielding him from the horns, but now he succumbs to their power. Ig reads Lee's mind and sees the night of the murder, Lee followed Merrin into the woods where he declared his love for her, she rejects him and says she loves Ig only, angered he rapes and murders Merrin with a blow to the head with a rock, he tried to frame Terry. Back in the present Ig and Lee fight, with Ig badly injured he is put in his car that is set on fire by Lee, tortured by the flames Ig drives into the water and presumably drowns, Lee tells the townspeople that Ig confessed the murder to him and committed suicide, however Ig survived the incident due to his powers, but he is scarred and mutilated, visiting Merrin's embittered father Dale (David Morse) he is given a key with his name on it, left as a gift for him before her death. Wearing Merrin's cross heals Ig's burns and removes his horns, in his and Merrin's childhood tree house the key unlocks a secret storage compartment, inside is a letter from Merrin, she reveals to having cancer, she knew that he was going to propose marriage to her, she broke up with him on pretence rather than let him be in pain watching her dies slowly, Ig is heartbroken, but overjoyed that Merrin still loved him. Ig confronts Lee and demands he tell all to the police, Terry and Eric who also know the truth turn up, he initially agrees to confess, but he seizes the gun, killing Eric and wounding Terry, he prepares to kill Ig, but Ig rips off the cross and turns into a satanic demon-like monster, his army of snakes are summoned and kill Lee, Ig spends his last moments with Terry before turning to stone, in the end Ig and Merrin reunite in heaven. Also starring Kelli Garner as Glenna Shepherd, James Remar as Derrick Perrish, Kathleen Quinlan as Lydia Perrish, Heather Graham as Veronica and Jay Brazeau as Father Mould. Radcliffe does a fantastic American accent and is good at being both vulnerable and dark, supporting stars Temple, Morse and Graham get their good moments as well, the mystery as to who committed the murder is gripping, the mission of love element works well, and the demonic material is ingenious, especially the characters openly expressing their inner sinful behaviour making for hilarious awkwardness, and great special effects as well, this is a darkly funny and very satisfying fantasy horror thriller. Very good!",Horns
7,Coventry,"Talk to the horns, 'cuz the face ain't listening!",6,16 October 2019,"The career of French horror prodigy Alexandre Aja is a fairly odd and uneven one, to say the least. The downright phenomenal ""Haute Tension"" that he made in his native country in 2003 granted him a one-way-ticket to Hollywood, but since then he has some issues establishing himself as a director of either light-headed gore flicks or serious atmospheric horror tales. His first Hollywood pic ""The Hills have Eyes"" was fantastic, and actually even one of the sole remakes that can claim superiority over the original, but since then there were a few misses (""Mirrors"") and hits (""Piranha""). With the more ambitious ""Horns"", Aja attempts to blend several genres at once, since the film qualifies as comedy, love-story drama and horror, but the end-result is also very much a mixed bag.The film is an adaptation of the novel by Joe Hill, who's actually Stephen King's son but wisely chose a different family name in order not to get confused and compared with his father. ""Horns"" has a rather intriguing and original plot, although it does require a large dose of suspension of disbelief, as it's a good old-fashioned whodunit mystery set in a quiet little town, but with unusual supernatural elements. Daniel Radcliffe takes further distance from his goody-two-shoes Harry Potter reputation as Ig Parrish; - a loner whom the entire community and the media believes he's guilty of raping and murdering his ex-girlfriend Merrin. But then something odd happens... Devilish horns grow out of Ig's forehead and, suddenly, all townspeople start confessing their darkest and most depraved sins and fantasies to him. Hey now, this might help him to unmask Merrin's real killer for sure! ""Horns"" is very well-directed by Aja and benefices greatly from the stellar cast, notably Radcliffe but also June Temple, James Remar and David Morse in supportive roles. Some of the sequences where people are painfully honest and straightforward to Ig are extremely powerful, like the interactions with own mother and father. Sadly, however, the concept also leads to a few dreadful clichés, like the hidden homosexuality confession or Heather Graham's pathetic role as an attention-seeking waitress. The film is also slightly overlong, in my humble opinion, and much of the flashback footage could have stayed behind in the editing room. The drama doesn't always work, and personally I would have scripted a completely different denouement, but I'm not complaining too much because ""Horns"" is an entertaining movie! For gore and graphic make-up effect, you'll need patience until the final act, but then Aja surely delivers.",Horns
8,Hey_Sweden,Sometimes we pick the sin we're going to live with.,7,9 December 2016,"Renowned author Stephen King obviously taught his son Joe, now a successful writer on his own, some good lessons. Here Joe came up with an odd but compelling story. It does take some getting used to, because it switches from a darkly comic tone to a dead serious one. As for the comedy, it's not always terribly funny, but it touches upon the intriguing idea of what many of us would do if we were EXTREMELY open and honest about our wildest and darkest desires.People in this tale are compelled to voice their secret, selfish, crazy thoughts and do whatever the Hell they feel like doing, thanks to Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe, doing a solid if not flawless American accent). Merrin (Juno Temple), the love of his life, was found murdered some time ago, and most people are convinced that Ig is the culprit. But, one day as he is nursing a hangover, some actual horns have sprouted from his head, and they have a profound influence on many of the people with whom he interacts. They just might come in handy as he attempts to solve the crime and clear his name.Although it should be clear to most people (even this viewer) who the killer is early on, one shouldn't let that detract too much from the offbeat pleasures of this amusing horror drama. It's gorgeously shot in widescreen, with director Alexandre Aja filling the frame with lots of detail. There is some good gore and makeup effects by the prolific Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger, as well as a plethora of snake imagery and a genuinely memorable finale. Just like his dad has done often, Joe spins a yarn that includes some effective childhood vignettes.Radcliffe heads a solid cast - Max Minghella as his childhood friend turned lawyer, Joe Anderson as his pathetic brother, James Remar and Kathleen Quinlan as his parents, Heather Graham in a small but funny turn as a vain, self serving waitress, and David Morse as Merrins' angry, grief-stricken father.While far from perfect, ""Horns"" is just interesting enough to make it a welcome deviation from blander contemporary genre fare.Seven out of 10.",Horns
9,LeonLouisRicci,Overlong but Sumptuous and Spellbinding at Times,7,9 June 2015,"Director Aja and Cinematographer Frederick Elmes Deliver a Devilishly Delightful, if Overlong, Stylish Study of Human Fallibility and Frightening Displays of Hidden Secrets. The Best Part of the Thing is when Iggy (Daniel Radcliffe) Sporting a Set of Horns Fitting for a Fallen Angel discovers that the Protrusions make Everyone Reveal Their Innermost and Darkest Desires.But the Movie is want to Give Us much More. Some of it is an Awkward Combination of a ""Who Done it?"" and other Genre Bending Stuff. The Two Hour Running Time seems to Stretch a bit Providing for too Many Characters as Suspects and the Plot gets Bogged Down at times as it Reveals Who is Who and What is What.Overall, it is a Beautiful Looking Film Overstuffed with Ideas. But most of it is Intriguing enough to Hold Attention to its Bizarreness with Outstanding SFX and Artistic Flare to Burn. Not All of it is Satisfying Story wise and it may be Guilty of being a bit too Much. Recommended for something Off Beat. It's got Plenty of Style and Excellent Devil Doings for the Horror Crowd. Yes, it goes on for far too long but the Ride getting there is Filled with Colorful Energy and the whole thing Looks Sharp, Shiny, and Sumptuous.",Horns
10,CinemaSerf,Off-the-wall comedy murder mystery for Potter fans...,6,7 February 2020,"This has quite a clever premiss - as Daniel Radcliffe's girlfriend dies mysteriously and suddenly he starts growing horns from his head. On the face of it, you'd think it a bit predictable - he is being punished for her murder; a view held by almost everyone around him. Well, he's having none of that and so sets out to discover exactly what happened. It's a sort of comedy thriller, not particularly strong on either, but Max Minghella is good too and it builds (albeit a bit ponderously) to quite an entertaining climax. Very much a vehicle for the star and not a film we'll be talking about in twenty years, but a fun disposable watch for a wet afternoon.",Horns
11,utgard14,"""Love made devils of us both.""",6,27 December 2014,"Well this was pretty good, although it wasn't quite what I expected. It's not a horror movie, for those going into it expecting it to be. The backbone of it is a murder mystery but there are supernatural elements added to it, as well as a good bit of humor. The mystery part isn't the greatest. I figured out who the killer was immediately with little effort. I can only imagine most other viewers will, as well. But the other stuff with the horns and the way they make people act provides for some nice dark comedy. I was impressed with Daniel Radcliffe, although he needs to keep working on his accent. His pronunciation is a little too pointed at times. Juno Temple is always great to watch. Wish she was in this more. The rest of the cast is solid. Nice to see Heather Graham in a small but fun role. It's a good movie. It's not without flaws but it is pretty original and not pretentious, which is a rarity these days. Goes on a little longer than necessary but I was never bored. I liked the ending, too.",Horns
12,neil-476,Radcliffe impresses in a good supernatural thriller,8,7 November 2014,"Ig's life is in a mess – his girlfriend Merrin has been brutally murdered, and the whole town seems to think he did it. In those circumstances, the last thing you want is to suddenly grow a pair of horns out of your forehead, especially when those horns lead to people losing their inhibitions and saying exactly what they think to you.I went into this film with mixed expectations – I thoroughly enjoyed Joe Hill's novel (adapted for the screen quite well here), and I love Juno Temple (here doing the best she can with the doomed Merrin, somewhat underdeveloped as a character and required mainly to waft around fetchingly, take her clothes off, and excel in a single major emotional scene). And then there is the casting of Daniel Radcliffe as Ig. I am already on record as having grave reservations about young Mr Radcliffe as a performer – he was the only one of the 3 principal kids in the Harry Potter films not to have improved over the saga, his Woman In Black character was Harry Potter in sidewhiskers and, while he was OK in What If, the film made no great demands on him.He's really rather good in this. The film takes him outside his familiar comfort zone, at which point it becomes clear whether he can actually act outside the range amiable to anxious, and he can. Ig's life is falling apart – he is confused, bereaved, drunk, angry, and then these horns appear to add to his problems, and Radcliffe does well in conveying the turmoil of this troubled young man. I think the American accent helps. I am prepared to cut him a bit more slack on the basis of Horns. There is good support from the rest of the cast.This film is not going to please gorehounds and people who want Shock from their horror movies, because it isn't really a horror movie. It's more a whodunnit with supernatural elements, and a sprinkling of very black humour. I enjoyed the book, and I enjoyed the film.",Horns
13,ferguson-6,The Devil with no disguise,5,27 October 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every once in awhile a movie comes around that seems to have all the markings of a cult film that could become a midnight movie favorite. Since I can best describe this one as a darkly comedic supernatural horror film, its only real hope for staying power is that teens and young adults embrace the outlandish look at good and evil, and make it a regular on the midnight movie circuit.Director Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes) has long been part of the ""splat pack"" and this time his source material has good genes. The popular book was written by Joe Hill, son of the great Stephen King. It's an oddly atmospheric and sometimes funny film with theological undertones, and Aja stays mostly under control until the ultra-violent ending sequence. Daniel Radcliffe stars as Ig, a young man widely suspected by his fellow small town residents of murdering his true love (Juno Temple). After a visually creative opening that turns Ig's world upside down and moves us from heaven to hell, we follow Ig's attempt to solve the murder with the help of his attorney and long time friend (Max Minghella). And then one morning, things get really weird. Ig sprouts devil horns from his forehead. Things also get fun. This devilish look has the effect of causing people to confess their darkest inner thoughts  those thoughts we don't even admit to ourselves!Much of the movie plays as a basic whodunit, and the entire thing has a ""Twin Peaks"" feel to it  right down to the diner (Eve's Diner with an apple logo). There are flashes of satire aimed at the news media, the drug culture, religion, and parenthood; and its core is a theme of ""every devil used to be an angel"". With the satanic element, you can be sure Rock 'n Roll comes into play (David Bowie, Marilyn Manson, The Pixies), and it's actually kind of fun to watch Ig take advantage of his supernatural powers with a combination of evil and charm.Radcliffe takes the role seriously and his approach adds some bite to the humorous elements. Juno Temple has limited screen time as his love interest, while Heather Graham goes full out nutso as the publicity seeking waitress, and Kelli Garner has the most frustrating role (her talents are wasted, except for a bizarre donut scene). Minghella doesn't bring much to a role that had some potential, but Joe Anderson delivers as Ig's drug addicted trumpet playing brother. James Remar and Kathleen Quinlan each have an extended scene as Ig's parents, and David Morse delivers as the angry dad who has lost a daughter.Mr. Aja throws a mixture of style and elements as he takes full advantage of the gloomy and colorful Pacific Northwest setting. Numerous flashbacks are utilized, including some childhood events that impact the current situation. The pitchfork, horns and serpents are there to distinguish good versus evil, but mostly you better be prepared for a twisted hoot that reminds a bit of Bubba Ho-Tep in the outrageous blend of comedy and horror  yep, the makings of a midnight cult favorite.",Horns
14,morrison-dylan-fan,Getting the bull by the horns.,8,26 October 2014,"Due to a friend being a fan of the Harry Potter movie series,I decided that I would introduce her to the Horror genre,by giving her a DVD of the Daniel Radcliffe-starring Hammer Horror The Women In Black for her birthday.With having gotten a positive response for the gift,I was thrilled to discover that Radcliffe was teaming up with the leading director of The New Wave of Extreme French Horror for a Horror epic,that led to me trying to grip the devil by the horns.The plot:After making a very public break-up with her boyfriend Ig Perrish,the raped and murdered body of Merrin Williams is found in the woods near a tree house that she always spent time in with her boyfriend.Due to everyone in the town knowing that Williams and Perrish were childhood sweethearts,Perrish finds himself being declared the lead suspect,and charged with Williams murder.Firmly stating his innocence by announcing that he is still in love with Williams,Perrish heads to a bar to drown his sorrow,and the shadow of the up-coming court case.Being treated as an outcast in the bar,Perrish is relieved to receive some sympathy from the bar maid,who offers Perrish the chance to sleep with her.Waking up the next day,Perrish discovers to his horror,that what appears to be devil horns are growing out of his head.Visiting his Dr,Perrish finds that instead of helping him to remove the horns,the Dr suddenly begins to tell Perrish about his inner demons.Meeting up with friends and family,Perrish is horrified to find all of them acting completely different around him,With all of Perrish friends being completely open about their inner demons.As everyone starts to go deranged around him,Perrish begins to suspect that his horns have the power to make people reveal their darkest secret,which leads Perrish to deciding that he will use the horns to track down Williams killer.View on the film:Entwined by a mythical performance from the beautiful Juno Temple, (who shows that she is not afraid to show some skin) and a sombre David Morse, Daniel Radcliffe gives a devilish performance as Ig Perrish.Using a fake US accent rather well,Radcliffe smoothly handles the titles genre criss-crossing,as Radcliffe shows Perrish carry grief over Williams death round his neck,whilst using his new- found skills to create some mischief,and to also get Williams killer to open up and reveal themselves.Adapted from Joe Hill's (aka:Stephen King's son Joking,I mean,Joe King) novel,the screenplay by Keith Bunin soaks up the New England setting,with Bunin showing the area to be one where everyone knows each other,and everyone walks the line on suspecting Perrish of being Williams killer.Avoiding the risk of the film becoming self- consciously quirky,Bunin smartly uses flashbacks to show the early stages of Perrish and Williams relationship, and to also give subtle hints to the demons lurking around the.Along with the Young Adult- tinge flashbacks,Bunin cuts the film with harsh indie Comedy and rough demonic horror,which despite disappointingly never offering the slightest hint as to why Perrish has got the horns,crackles across the screen,as Perrish tries to get a grip on his new horns,in order to uncover the hidden killer.Cut for its upcoming UK release in order for it to get a 15, (or,so that the studio can get their hands on cash from teen Harry Potter fans) director Alexandre Aja and cinematographer Frederick Elmes show a tremendous focus in keeping the films distinctively quirky,weird Horror atmosphere firmly threaded to the story,with Aja showing the rape and murder of Williams (which has been cut for the UK cinema version) in a raw,non-gratuitous manner,which shows the reason behind the towns peoples disguise towards Perrish.Along with the brutal,matter-of-fact murder scene,Aja and Elmes also show a stylish eye for brash cartoon Horror,with the colour green being brilliantly use to show Perrish's memories of spending time in the tree house with Williams,as the screen starts to get covered with flickers of red,when Perrish begins to embrace the demon.",Horns
15,FlashCallahan,He's finally got rid of Potter's Shadow.....,9,27 October 2014,"The adaptation of Joe Hill's novel surrounding a young man who grows horns overnight, which aid in helping him discover the killer of his girlfriend....Not only that, they appear to bring out 'the beast' in everyone who comes near him....It's another film where I haven't read the original source, and to be fair, it just seemed like Radcliffe was desperate to rid himself of Potter. And Aja hasn't made a decent film in eight years, so truth be told, my expectations were not very high for this.And I have a massive phobia of snakes......But wow, is this one of the biggest surprises of the year, and all the advertising for the movie, and it being released for Halloween is just stupid of the studio, it's not a horror film in the slightest, its a fantasy movie, almost as if Rob Zombie has discovered a young adult novel and given it his own twist.It's really surprising how much this movie resembles Gone Girl, from the disappearance and accusations of the townsfolk, right down to the narrative. Just like Gone Girl, the narrative starts at a separate time to the actual story, and copes with it just as good as Fincher's movie.But it's wonderfully funny too, when Ig first gets his horns, he goes to the doctors, and much like Willis in Unbreakable, he can read people's thoughts, and this can leads to some really laugh out loud moments, as well as some heartfelt moments too.As the summary says, this is Radcliffes film, and here he's finally gotten rid of that Shadow he's had since 2001, and in my opinion, this is his finest role, this is the role that will define him as a leading actor, he's brilliant as the tortured Ig.Juno Temple is as good as always, and David Morse is fantastic as the grieving father. If you haven't read the book, or seen any of the trailers, my advice is see it without knowing too much, because there is a wonderful, very somber twist to the film, which will make you realise why I think its wrong that the studio have classed it as a horror movie.Its a film about breaking taboo, seeing people's true colours, and falling from grace.Its a sensational love story, and one of the best films to be released in 2014.",Horns
16,phd_travel,Original mix of fantasy horror and comedy that doesn't always work,5,3 November 2014,"Daniel Radcliffe stars as a man who is suspected of murdering his girlfriend. This is an uneasy mix of black comedy, fantasy horror, romantic drama. Some aspects work - the black comedy is funny in parts when he gets people to show their true colors. The fantasy horror is okay. Not too gory. The romantic drama isn't great because there are too many people in love with such a plain girl. Juno Temple was the wrong choice. Her face is not pretty enough for romantic lead especially to cause so much longing and passion in so many. The movie is a too long by 20 minutes or so. After the villain is revealed it's kind of predictable after that. The style and mysterious ambiance of the Pacific Northwest is suitably eerie.Acting is quite alright especially from the supporting cast including the still pretty Heather Graham. Some other familiar faces appear including Max Minghella as the best friend. Daniel Radcliffe has a convincing accent and his small size doesn't seem to figure. He looks pretty disheveled and tortured as the hero. His acting outside of Harry Potter is more believable than Emma Watson's.Overall see it if you are a Daniel Radcliffe fan - it's not that great but okay for one watch. The approach is original but doesn't always work.",Horns
17,trashgang,great,8,7 January 2016,"Took me a while to see this one but Santa has put it under the tree finally. Have seen the director Alexandre Aja growing from a gory director to major productions some good others not I was looking forward to see this one. Why, because some do love it and others hate it and that means it is something special. There's no in between, love or hate, and I'm in the love group. I never had any trouble with Daniel Radcliffe after seen The Woman In Black (2012) he convinced me to step out of the Potter world. And here he shows again that he's worth picking up. The flick itself is indeed a bit strange and to be honest it isn't really a horror but more of a love story with a twist. Don't get me wrong, some will be offended by the gore added but there aren't any scary parts or jump moments. Even clocking in at two hours it was over before you know it. I was even surprised that it had some nudity here and there. I can't go into the story itself because I would spoil it all. But if you are into fantasy in the style of Peter Jackson then Horns is worth a view. For the geeks of Aja it is also worth picking up, even as the gore comes in towards the ending. I even had a laugh here and there because the Horns let people tell their 'horny' stuff and dreams and the cop scene was hilarious.A nice surprise this flick was...Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",Horns
18,deloudelouvain,Not too shabby,7,16 February 2015,"I wasn't really expecting anything when I saw the poster of the movie. I mean Harry Potter with horns? What was I suppose to think about that? So I gave it a shot and it was actually not that bad. Daniel Radcliffe makes you forget once and for all that he can be somebody else then Harry Potter. The script and the actors were all okay. Good enough to relax in your couch on a Sunday afternoon and enjoy a movie. It might not be the best movie ever but it was entertaining enough for me. Why it is categorized in the horror movies (like many others by the way that shouldn't be in there) is a complete mystery to me. It's everything but a horror movie. It's just a fantasy movie, and it's an okay one.",Horns
19,siderite,Supernatural murder thriller that promises much and underdelivers,6,23 February 2021,"There is a small town where everybody knows everybody else, they all spent their childhoods together, they fall in love with each other and now, they kill. Everybody, for reasons not really explained, including the parents of the guy, think Daniel Radcliffe's character has murdered his childhood sweetheart, but they can't prove it. So we get through some flashbacks of everybody involved so as to feel the story has depth, then we reach the final twist and the story ends. And to make it less boring and predictable, a gimmick is added: the main character grows horns that give him the devilish powers of influencing people's sins.Now, this could have changed something, maybe, but in fact it only makes the story move faster towards its inevitable conclusion: the unmasking of the murderer. The acting was decent, the movie values good, but the plot and editing left a lot to be desired. Characters popped up just to fill a gap, then were never seen again, or they behaved quite unlike the background story that was clumsily attached to them. And then we get to the end and it is... really really stupid. It provides little closure, it goes against what pretty much everybody involved wanted and its really wasteful and disappointing. No moral value, no catharsis, no entertainment.Bottom line: this is based on a book, so I guess the story could not have been changed too much, but in this case it should have been. It's a badly crafted story with a gimmick slapped on and a good cast that somehow was shoehorned to play in the film and pull the audience in. I don't recommend it.",Horns
20,KineticSeoul,Underrated film that is worth a watch,7,20 October 2015,"I first passed on this movie because I thought it would be another art-house movie that has Daniel Radcliffe with horns. I will say Daniel Radcliffe fit his role in this really well. So the plot is about a guy that is going through major depression after the death of his girlfriend. Soo he starts to grow horns that grant him special powers. The momentum for this movie keeps building until he finds out who the killer is than it starts to drag a bit. But I did like the mystery and character interactions in this. Especially since it delves into the dark and twisted side of what the characters are thinking. This isn't really a horror movie, but more of a emotional mystery movie that revolves around love and revenge. With supernatural and dark comedic elements that play a huge factor in the story. For the most part this movie had my attention from start to finish. Mainly because I found the character interactions to be intriguing, sometimes humorous and because I actually cared about what was going to happen next. Overall this is actually a immersive and fun movie experience.7.6/10",Horns
21,Hellmant,Definitely a slight departure for Aja and Radcliffe.,9,8 October 2014,"'HORNS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Dark fantasy thriller flick based on the cult book, of the same name, by Joe Hill. It was directed by Alexandre Aja (who's well known for directing and writing other horror films like 'HIGH TENSION', 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES' and 'PIRANHA 3D') and written by first-time feature film writer Keith Bunin. Daniel Radcliffe stars in the movie (replacing Shia LaBeouf, who was first cast in the film) as a young man who gains special paranormal abilities when he wakes up, one hungover morning, to find horns growing out of his head. He uses his newfound abilities to solve his girlfriend's murder, who he's suspected of killing. The film also stars Max Minghella, Juno Temple, Joe Anderson, Kelli Garner, James Remar, Kathleen Quinlan and Heather Graham. I found it to be bizarrely interesting and oddly entertaining.Radcliffe plays Ig Perrish; a young lover who awakens, one drunken morning, to find out that his girlfriend, Merrin Williams (Temple), has been brutally raped and murdered. Although almost everyone in town thinks Ig killed Merrin, including his own parents, he's found innocent of the charges, a year later. While living the life of a hated alcoholic outcast he wakes up, another hungover morning, to find out he has horns growing out of his head and special demonic abilities. He then uses his new powers to influence the locals, into telling him their deepest and darkest secrets, and becomes obsessed with finding Merrin's true killer.While the film isn't as graphically violent as Aja's more gruesome horror flicks it is still a pretty dark and twisted movie, with a pretty consistently sick sense of humor. In some ways it reminds me of earlier Tim Burton and Sam Raimi flicks. It's got some cool visual effects and Aja does a great job of bringing the mythical world he's created to life. Radcliffe is also great in the lead (although LaBeouf probably would have been better) and it's great to see him continuously grow and diversify as an actor. I found the whole thing to be pretty amusing and strangely intriguing. If you like dark fantasy films, like this, you might really enjoy it. It's definitely a slight departure for Aja and Radcliffe.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/hS02wz4z3uU",Horns
22,thesar-2,Gone Guy,9,11 April 2015,"I made a bad choice. I made myself choose between two experimental, independent and one-word titled 2014 ""horror"" movies for my Friday night pleasure and selected TUSK over HORNS despite HORNS's first IMDb Plot Keyword being ""male frontal nudity"" and I was hoping to see Daniel Radcliffe in the buff. TUSK ended up being bad, whereas, HORNS was fantastic. (Side note: it was just some bar dude who showed his willy.) Inventive, courageous, fun, funny and interesting, HORNS kept me involved through to the end. It never overstayed its odd concept and, instead, just plowed ahead with its mission. Probably in the minority here, but this was my ninth Radcliff film, though first non-Harry Potter Radcliffe role and it's my absolute favorite of his. This dude can act and he kept me engaged. I laughed out loud a bit, loved the use of the fantasy elements and truly can't wait to see this film again. I hope this movie gets recognized if not now, years from now, as a great vision of filmmaking. Cheers!",Horns

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Should be more than enough to spike your interest, even if it's flawed.",6,2 November 2018,"'Horns (2013)' is more a mystery than anything else and there thankfully is a nice, self-contained little story at the heart of the piece, one that doesn't really focus on the eponymous horns so much as use their abilities to see the story through to its end (in terms of both theme and plot). The eventual, albeit disappointing, reveal isn't necessarily obvious, either, as the film spends a lot of time successfully muddying the waters when it comes to whether or not our 'hero' might actually deserve the spiky things growing from his skull. While it's usually entertaining and not afraid to also be properly dark, the flick does have its fair share of quite severe tonal issues and a third act that doesn't really live up to what it could've been - bolstered by that disappointing reveal I mentioned earlier. This ultimately makes for an experience that's enjoyable but flawed, sometimes frustratingly so. 6/10",Horns
25,bowmanblue,"A little bit messy, but original and worth it",7,26 March 2015,"First of all let me say that I am not a fan of Daniel Radcliffe. I was never into the Harry Potter films and, although he did well enough in 'Woman in Black' I didn't like the film much. Plus I saw him on a UK chat show a few years ago and found him generally obnoxious. However, I do basically watch any old horror movie, so, even though he was in it, I thought I'd give it a go. And – amazingly – I'm glad I did! It's actually a little longer than your average ninety minute horror yarn and it tells the tale of 'Ig' (or rather Daniel Radcliffe sporting quite a convincing American accent) – a young man whose girlfriend is murdered, leaving him the prime suspect in a small town. Although there's no hard evidence to link him to the crime, the general consensus is that he's guilty. As if that wasn't bad enough for the young ex-wizard, he develops horns on his head that only certain people can see. And these horns turn out to be more than just cosmetic enhancements – they start bestowing strange powers upon him.Like I said, 'Horns' is a little longer than the normal horror film. This means that it's padded out with flashbacks from Ig's childhood, showing what went on before (and, after you've watched the whole film, you'll probably spot the clues as to what's happened). The bouncing back and forth in time does sometimes feel a little disjointed and you may just want to find out what's happening next, rather than see what's already gone. But all the performances are good, making sure they're all a quirky bunch and the bits where the horns lead Ig astray are darkly funny.The best part of 'Horns' is that it's actually quite original. I haven't really seen a film like it before. So, even though it was a little messy (might have benefited from about 10-15 minutes being cut) I found it was actually worth it just for the novelty value. Don't expect all the questions to be answered. The film relies on a certain amount of 'religious knowledge' to fill in some of the blanks. You don't have to believe in any religion to appreciate this film, but you have to accept that if you're going to enjoy it then you're going to have to be okay with religion for storytelling purposes.I'm still not a fan of Radcliffe, but I did enjoy his performance and would continue to watch him again – in the right vehicle (like this one).",Horns

28,Bored_Dragon,Harry Potter with Horns :D,7,25 January 2017,"The title suggests that in the new ""Harry Potter"" some chick gave Harry the horns, and a good part of the movie leads us to think the same, but at the end, we find out that she only lied to him about that, for reasons I won't reveal now. Harry is still with Ginny, portrayed by different actress now, but she's also redhead, so it does not poke your eye too much. As Voldemort is killed in the last movie, we now have a new villain, hidden in the character of Harry's friend Lee, who has some resemblance to Tom Riddle. Lee is also in love with Ginny and his frustration piles up for many years. Finally, his attempt to rape her goes bad and he kills her. Harry is the last one who saw her alive so he gets accused of her murder. While he is trying to clear his name searching for the real murderer, strange horns start to grow on his forehead. Those horns have the magic power to bring the worst out of people and make them reveal their darkest secrets. At the same time, Nagini shows up to keep him company. She is a lot smaller than in previous movies, probably because she is now a real snake instead of CGI. In the end, Harry completely transforms into Devil and in the final battle against Lee they both get killed. Then instead of Nagini swallowing Lee up, Lee in his death rattle swallows Nagini. I'm still trying to understand the symbolism of this scene. Hermione is just supporting role here, she's blond now, works as a waitress, has a reputation of an easy girl and she finally had sex with Harry. She is also portrayed by a new actress, and, for some reason, names are changed to all characters in the movie. I suppose that's because this is a low budget movie and they did not pay copyright for characters. Although effects are terrible compared to all prequels, the story is more down to earth and very convincing and interesting. Oh, yes, I almost forgot... there is no Ron in this movie, but it easily goes unnoticed because he is pretty much redundant in all the movies so far.P.S. Now seriously. Although this is nowhere near excellence, it is shot more than good. The acting is good and the movie contains some beautiful cinematography that you should really see for yourself.7/10",Horns
29,ironhorse_iv,This dark fantasy horror film about a man turning into a devil was a bit disappointing. What the hell happen!?,6,10 January 2016,"I'll tell you, what happen! This devilish movie directed by Alexandra Aja was so hell bend on making us, laugh, that it fails to adapted, the best parts of author Joe Hill's novel, with the same name. Without spoiling the movie, too much, all, I got to say, is I really didn't, how this movie turn out. The movie has way too many dark and unpleasantly jokes, tasteless nudity, ill-judged dialogue and over the top cartoony violence that it really made the serious melodrama tone of Iggy Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) trying to solve a murder mystery of his dead girlfriend, Merrin Williams (Juno Temple), through the use of demonic powers, seem secondary to the hilarious of impulsive behavior. Because of this, I felt like the film tones was all over the place. Not only that, but the film seem a bit dumb down, compare to the novel. All the sophistication material from the novel seem to be missing from this film. A good example of this, is the ""treehouse of the mind"" sequence. While, I do understand, why the movie felt like using extreme use of impulsive behaviors to gain people interested. I felt like those 'dopamine grabbers' were somewhat misused. Just think, how great, the movie would had been, if they use sex, drug, and violence to show a more intelligent side of the story. It would truly had grab the concept of the novel by the horns, better. One thing, I didn't about the film is how the timeline of events has change. In the book, all of the events takes place, a full year after the murder in which, Iggy has been cleared of all charges through a lack of evidence. This allows, a greater amount of time, for the supporting characters to hide their true state of mind about Iggy and a greater shock value for the readers, when their true feelings get expose. Yet, in the film, all of the events, are all fairly recent after the murder. This doesn't give enough time, for characters to hide anything, because how the investigation is still ongoing. It's not as suspenseful as the book. One thing that both, the book and movie fail at; was the ending. Both were very disappointing. However, I would rather have the climatic fight at the Foundry in the book over the one, we got in this film. The results of all these mistakes, cause the loosely based movie to look a bit lukewarm. Indeed, hell has frozen over. Don't get me wrong, not all of the film was bad. The acting was alright for the most part. Daniel Radcliffe really does shine as the main lead, despite his character not having the voice changeling power. At least, it's not Shia LeBeouf as the lead role. Thank God! In the end, Radcliffe was perfect for the role, as he's able to show, his good angelic side, and also his punishing wickedness. Another thing, I like about the film is how Juno Temple isn't typecast as the over promiscuity female, here. This is one of the few movies, I seem her in, that she was somewhat, a decent character that you kinda want to root for. Still, nevertheless, her scenes in the film were a little far too short. Because of this, her character seem a bit one-dimensional and shallow. Most of film has Juno Temple as eye candy to Daniel Radcliffe's character. Also, it's really hard to believe, that her character, is religionist, when most of her adult scenes have her, naked, sleeping with Iggy. It didn't have that emotional impact as it should. The supporting cast is also a mixed bag for me. Kelli Garner, Max Minghella, and Joe Anderson were great, as Iggy's trouble friends & family members. However, I didn't think the movie gave, their characters, enough depth. It was very out of the blue, and jarring to suddenly find out that Iggy's brother, Terry (Joe Anderson) is a drug addict, without any backstory to it. Also, the film is, a bit sad, to see, that Kelli Garner's character, Glenna Shepard, doesn't get her happy ending, despite how good of a character, she was. For Max Minghella, his character is way too nice and predictable, that the twist toward the end, didn't have the punch, like it should had. Also, I didn't like, how the movie cut away, most of his backstory like his eye damage. Another mixed bag for me, was the music choice. I like how songs like 'Heroes' by David Bowie, ""Personal Jesus"" by Marilyn Manson 'Eyes on Fire' by Blue Foundation and 'Where is my Mind' by the Pixies, fit so well, with much of the film. Still, I was hoping that songs from the book like The Rolling Stones song ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"", would appeared. Sadly, it does not. Other things, that I love from this film is the make-up. It really did look, like Daniel Radcliffe was truly, turning to the devil in this film. Also, the visual effects in this film were somewhat impressive. I also like, all of the Canadian locations and all the biblical symbolism, they used in this film. It gave the film, it's unique, fun-looking horror style. Overall: The suspense and mystery in this film was very lackluster, because Horns feel cramped and cluttered, by unfunny jokes, pointless nudity, and cartoony violence. In my opinion, the movie should have save more room to explore the story's classical themes of good and evil. It would had made a better film. Horns is an adaptation that never quite hits the dramatic heights of the brilliant Joe Hill (AKA Stephen King's son) novel on which it is based on. To hell with this film.

What I didn't realise was just how much I was going to enjoy it.Horns is nothing particularly special, but it has it's merits and I can confidently say I walked away satisfied with what I had watched.With a fantastic cast, a gripping storyline and a really quite neat ending I'm not entirely convinced Radcliffe will break free of the Potter curse but this was a good start.The Good:Excellent story Juno Temple David Morse The Bad: The ""Potter"" curse was certainly present Things I learnt from this movie: Where Is My Mind? is officially on every movies soundtrack Juno Temple is allergic to clothing",Horns

That means the movie is not bad, but how come I missed it for this long. This is the best dark-fantasy movie I have seen recently. But earlier, I thought it would be like the movie 'Tusk' which made me a little uncomfortable to watch. So in the end, what's the difference between the tusk and/or the horn. Both come in a pair and animals have it to defend themselves from the threat. When I watched that movie, I lost interest in this. Yep, it is a silly reason and now I feel bad for that.This movie dominated by the British cast, especially for having Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple I thought it was British film, actually it was not. It was a Canadian-US jointly produced, adapted from a book of the same name and directed by 'Mirror' director. The story was so good, not genuine, though explored the theme very well. For every few minutes later, the narration was taking a turn and that made the plot to get lot tighter before heading for the concluding part.Maybe this the best movie of Radcliffe that I've seen after his goodbye to 'Harry Potter' movie series. I don't think he's a chocolate boy type, but this kind of movie suits him well. I think he should get muscles for more movie like this, but his height is another negative factor. The film was entirely shot in Canada, the photography was great, music as well as performances. Even those settings like woods, tree house feels kind of wet English and Scottish atmosphere that fits for a devilish mythical charactered movie like this.

I thought he was really good in this film and did the protagonist justice. In fact, the entire cast was very good and believable.I enjoyed the two stories, childhood versus adulthood, and how events from your childhood can still have an effect on adulthood decisions.

What a special film!",Horns
33,Dr_Coulardeau,Horny Horns and Hot Bugle,8,16 November 2018,"You will know from the very start there is something wrong in this film. You might think it is the fact that the director is French, but you will be wrong, though the French have always liked snakes and the film, like the book, is full of snakes. The general frame of the story is not changed in the film though some details are, probably to make the film more credible for the rational mind of a French director. But this rationalization of some elements does not make the film deeper or scarier or even more dramatic. Horror is not logical or rational. It is basically irrational and it is only dictated - and dictated is the only word that fits horror - by some unconscious connections the darkest side of our human minds establishes between things that normally have no connections at all.Thus to make Iggy into a summary of the mythical history of Satan, in fact here Lucifer first and then Satan, the white angel with vast white wings that is cast down burning more than hot, definitely to a crisp like Lucifer was cast down from heaven and his shifting into Satan, a dark burning piece of coal, is too rational to be believable. And then this devil with his monstrous horns being hurt, wounded, actually into dying like a human being with a shotgun and a fork is fascinatingly absurd. Nothing can hurt the devil. In the book, Iggy was not Satan but a human being who had been destroyed out of jealousy and was sent back with a mission: reset the clock of life back to pure virginity. Here this human dimension is lost.But the worst change, of course, concerns the personality of Lee, the best friendly enemy that only dreams of lying, cheating, stealing, fooling his friends, his best friends first and most, and everyone else. The social jealousy of this Lee who dreams himself poor and rejected though he is from a wealthy family, for Iggy who he declares his best friend and who is from a very wealthy family of jazz musicians with his brother the anchorman of a very successful TV show, is not justified and it is hardly shown. The LA television show has disappeared. The brother is still a trumpet player but he is making a living by playing in local clubs or bars or taverns. And Lee is no longer a compulsive liar. In fact, he is nearly angelic and he really saves Iggy from drowning.In this scene or the challenge, the text does not correspond to the images. Iggy is going to run in the shopping mall cart down some kind of chute into the river. He is supposed to do it naked. A bad script girl somewhere must have forgotten to mention ""naked"" on Iggy's costume since he runs his cart with his briefs on, and he is accused of not having run naked because he had kept his snickers. There definitely is somewhere a funny script girl who is prudish and does not know that snickers are not briefs, and those briefs, by the way, were not that brief, more some kind of boxers.But Lee actually dives into the river to save Iggy from drowning, trapped as he was by the logs on the river, over his head. How did he manage to get through the logs into the water under the logs? I saw him falling into a section that was not blocked by the logs. The script once again must have had some blank spots.Apart from that it is the story of a girl that loves a boy so much and of a boy that loves a girl so much that she cannot accept to let things go easy when the first real obstacle, a medical family heritage actually, comes up, and she makes the wrong decision and causes the worst catastrophe imaginable. Add to that best friend Lee who has always been waiting for this opportunity to slip his two bits in-between the two lovers, and the catastrophe becomes a tragedy. But I must say the tense thrilling density necessary for the tragedy not to fall into an entertaining melodrama is not present, made light and not tight as it is by the visual effects that are nothing but visual effects, and the final confrontation should never have been in full daylight and under bright sunshine. A dark dusk or early night, with at most a little bit of starlight and moonlight would or could have been a lot better.Daniel Radcliffe should know what is said in the film must be what we see, and horror, satanic, devilish or even angelic (because there are some horrendous angels), needs tight tension in a somber, meaning dark and menacing, awesome atmosphere. It's a shame because that actor has a potential and he cannot express it because he seems to be all the time frozen by the way he acted when he was Prince Harry Potter. Hey, man, there is life out there and you have to bring it back into your films.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Horns
34,zkonedog,"Gets The Tone Of The Book Wrong, But Still Manages Respectability",5,31 August 2018,"In terms of adapting Joe Hill's book onto the big screen, there are a number of things that go right for ""Horns"". Sadly, this effort also does not seem to realize what the tone of the novel is all about, rendering it an adequate film and no more.For a basic plot summary, ""Horns"" tells the story of Ig Parrish (Daniel Radcliffe), who wakes up one morning after a wicked bender with horns growing out of his head. Not only that, but these horns seem to have the power to influence other people based on Ig's conversations with them. Suspected in the recent death of longtime girlfriend Merrin (Juno Temple), Ig tries to put his life back together and reckon with his new protuberances at the same time. Interactions with best friend Lee (Mix Minghella) & brother Terry (Joe Anderson) help start connecting the dots as to what actually happened to Merrin.The main problem with this Alexandre Aja-directed flick is that it doesn't understand that Hill's novel isn't really about the horns. I understand that they are obviously the visual standout of the story, and perhaps work better on the big screen than even in print, but they are not the driving force of the story. Rather, Hill constructs a story where the horns are little more than the impetus for Ig to figure out his shady past and move forward.In this adaptation, however, it is very clear that Ig's interactions with the horns are paramount, and the character interactions are thrown in as best they can be. This leads to a film that technically adapts the nuts-and-bolts of Hill's novel pretty well, but loses most of its literary soul, if you will, in the process. Whereas the story should be absolutely brimming with deep character relationships and interesting observations, it instead is rather bland on that front because the focus is on the visual gags or off-beat humor.Also, I'd only go so far as to call the acting in this one ""so-so"". Sometimes, Radcliffe nails the role (especially when he is in a drunken stupor). Other times, however, he seems far too goofy to be taken seriously. The auxiliary cast is okay, but again not really given much room to shine because the whole thing is built away from them.I understand why this film was made in this particular fashion (it's the easiest way to do it), but I wish it would have built from the characters outward instead. Hill's novel is one of my favorites of all-time, and I wish this film could have given it a better cinematic reputation instead of a solid ""meh"".",Horns

Everyone is against him and he's desperate claiming his innocence until the day he wakes up with two ram's horns growing from his forehead. Whoever saw Daniel Radcliffe in the Harry Potter saga surely will have some difficulty to recognize him here. He has matured and seems to have taken advantage of this saga, where he shared the screen with dozens of consecrated actors, to learn from them. The plot begins very well, with the central character being target of an intense and anticipated social judgement. The origin of the horns is never clear, nor the reason why they have such a powerful effect. The ending is unfortunate, in the sense that I expected something stronger and more interesting. The cast plays its role satisfactorily but not surprisingly. The exception is Radcliffe, who shines and carries the film in his back, proving that he's not just Harry Potter but a young promise of the seventh art.

36,leonblackwood,"Surprisingly, not bad! 5/10",5,14 March 2015,"Review: For some unknown reason, I thought that this was going to be a witty film about teenage love but it's actually quite dark. After the mysterious death of Radcliffe's girlfriend, the whole town blames him for the rape/murder, so he fights to find the truth, with the help of his best friend. On top of that, these mysterious devil-like horns are growing out of his head and they give him the powers to get people to admit there darkest secrets and desires. I found the storyline quite strange but original in many ways but the whole horn thing just comes out of the blue without much explanation. Once the storyline unfolds, you can't help but root for the horned character but I was hoping that he was going to team up with David Morse to seek for justice. Anyway, the performance from Radcliffe wasn't bad but I honestly think that the movie would have been much better if a more established actor was playing the lead. It does seem to drag in places and there are a few unnecessary scenes, but it's a good film which is entertaining in parts. Watchable!Round-Up: Although I quite enjoyed this film, there are a couple of sketchy scenes like when the flaming hot Radcliffe gets picked up by his brother without getting burnt and what the hell was going on with those wings and snakes! Anyway, most of the cast was British but the director chose to make them speak American for some unknown reason. The whole Horns thing seemed to get overlooked most of the time and everyone was more concerned with the murder. There is a slight comedy element to the film because he can get people to tell there darkest secrets so you get to hear things like a policeman that fancies his male partner and a woman that wants a screaming kid to shut up. It does bring a bit of light to the movie but most of it is extremely dark. It is a well made film that reminded me a bit of Hellboy, but I'm sure that this book could get made much better if it was in the right hands. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $3.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dark drama/fantasy/thrillers about a accused rapist/murderer whose trying to find out who really killed his girlfriend, with the help of his new powers from his Horns. 5/10",Horns

I haven't really enjoyed any of his horror films since then, but I have to admit Horns was quite a unique experience. It was nothing like his previous films, and despite being considered a horror film it isn't really one. There aren't any scary moments in Horns and there is actually quite a bit of humor. It is more of a dark comedy mixed with mystery as the lead character, played by Daniel Radcliffe, has to figure out who murdered his girlfriend while the entire town suspects he did it. Along the process he acquires a strange supernatural ability after waking up one night with horns on his head. These horns make the people around him confess their deepest and darkest desires to him. He can also manage to look at people's past once he touches them. Using these abilities he sets out to find the killer, so you could say this is a superhero film as well. You could classify this film in so many genres because at times it felt like Aja didn't know what kind of film he wanted to make. There were many tonal shifts and some of the genre changes felt forced. I was really into this film during the first hour because the premise hooked me and the story was interesting. I also found the weird sense of humor quite funny, but as the story progressed and some revelations were made my enjoyment faded rapidly. It just lost track of what it was trying to do and most of the genre switches felt displaced and misbalanced. The film also becomes tedious towards the end because it felt overlong at two hours. Perhaps the childhood flashbacks could have been eliminated to allow a better pacing because I didn't feel they added much to the story. Horns had so much potential to be a better film but unfortunately it suffers from trying to balance several tones and loses its identity in the process.Keith Bunin adapted the screenplay from Joe Hill's book, which I haven't read so I can't say how faithful the adaptation is. What I can say is that Daniel Radcliffe gives a strong performance and his American accent is spot on. It is interesting to see the transformation his character goes through as he discovers the power these new horns give him. Radcliffe is proving to have a wide range as he has played some dark characters this past year trying to break away from his Harry Potter days. I wasn't a fan of the supporting cast mostly because the dialogue in this film felt melodramatic and forced at times, but Juno Temple does give a solid performance. It was fresh to see her in this role as a sweet girl instead of the trashy trailer park character she has often played. We believe that this girl really is the object of affection of the townspeople. The rest of the characters in this film are forgettable and no one really adds anything to the story. This modern day fable-like story has a nice visual style to it. The town where it is set is gorgeous and we are surrounded by this beautiful landscape which contrasts with the darkness of the story and the characters. Unfortunately Horns doesn't just suffer from a mishmash of genres, but it also seems to have some inconsistencies with its premise. I can't get in to details without spoiling the film but there was something about the revelation of the murderer that didn't make sense to me. The other issue I had with Horns was that it never established some of the rules of what the horns could do. At times it seemed as if the people had to ask Radcliffe's character for permission to perform their darkest desires, but at others they simply did them even when he was against them. So why would some people ask them if they didn't need his permission in the first place? That was just a minor issue I had, but nothing that really took me out of the film. The first hour of Horns is really engaging and entertaining, but the final hour is a letdown.",Horns
38,cekadah,Eighth deadly sin,10,25 October 2014,"Director Alexandre Aja and writer Keith Bunin bring to the screen the seven deadly sins and a new eighth deadly sin. In this story we are presented all seven deadly sins - wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony - and a look into an eighth sin - love. How could love be a sin? Ig Perrish loved Merrin Williams so powerfully and confidently that upon her rejection of his marriage proposal - his love, his innocents, and his belief in her, trigger his fall from his self imagined or self imposed grace and peace. In his grappling with Merrin's rejection & murder, the towns people disdain of him, and his determination to expose the real killer, Ig looses all understanding of what his love for Merrin was all about. All he wanted from Merrin was the truth, yet everyone he did NOT love freely gave their true thoughts and feeling about themselves and others. Conversely, Merrin who did love him and he loved her, was the one who lied to him and caused Ig to imagine himself as the evil one - thus the horns. Merrins love for Ig so overshadowed her duty to be truthful with him she decided wrongly to lie to him! In trying to protect him from the pain he would have suffered had she been truthful, she instead made his life a living hell. So who was the truly evil one in this story? Ig because his self doubt made the horns grow? Merrin because she lied to protect Ig? Lee (the lawyer) because he was the perpetrator of death? Or the entire town because they willingly told their truths to Ig?In the end Ig finds his redemption in discovering the truth but the only way he can join Merrin is to reject the deliverance he achieves from his earthly hell and suffer a painful death. Quite a spectacular film with a fine performance by Daniel Radcliffe who is proving himself as an accomplished adult actor. Juno Temple's appearance is brief but well done. Some other reviewers found fault in some actors, I did not as everyone seems perfectly cast as their character.",Horns
39,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Unique horror, style all its own",9,8 March 2016,"Horns is not only one of the funniest, but also one of the smartest, most sharply written horror films in years. Based on a novel by Joe King, spawn of the king of nightmares himself, Stephen, it's got humour, wit, heart and some really sickening violence that'll shake you up in between fits of laughing. It's got a bad rep, but fvck the people man, I say it's great fun. One of the only complaints I have is that star Daniel Radliffe is kind of miscast, seeming a bit stiff in the skin of Ig Parrish, a scrappy do small town misfit accused of the brutal murder of his girlfriend Merrin(Juno Temple). Ig lives in a small coastal logging town that suspiciously resembles Squamish (hmm), and he's kind of an outsider amongst his family and the locals. Merrin was his link to normalcy, and her murder casts him out even further. His affluent parents (James Remar and Kathleen Quinlan) and musician brother (excellent Joe Anderson) do their best to help while harboring suspicions of their own against him. One day Ig wakes up with a pair of gnarly horns growing out of his noggin, which everyone can see, yet don't seem to give a crap about when they're around him. In fact, they seem to possess a dark power to make people's deep seated, ugly, and disastrously honest true natures manifest. It's here that the film's wonderfully deviant sense of humour comes into play, as each and every person he crosses paths with turns into a raving lunatic as their inhibitions disapate, giving way to scarily unhinged yet side splittingly funny versions of themselves. It's with this new found power that he sets out to find Merrin's real killer. It's a savage movie that takes full advantage of its R rating in all the departments: hard hitting violence, a full blooded sex sequence and some of the most down and dirty raunchy humour I've had the pleasure to witness. Quinlan and Remar nail their scenes, especially Remar, who reacts with grounded emotional torment to the effect of the horns, a rare moment for the film and one that should be in his demo reel. Temple has a ragged outsider vibe to her work, an unconventional beauty scarred by soulful eyes that hint at sadness, which works perfectly for her to bring Merrin to life as the Ig's fallen angel. David Morse brings his stony grit to the table in one scene as Merrin's grieving father as well, and Heather Graham disgusts and amuses as a skanky truckstop waitress whose true nature is pretty vile. The soundtrack is phenomenal, everything from The Pixies to Fever Ray, hits all the right notes and gives the film a lot of color and personality, as does the lush rainforest setting in BC. The small town feel was a good route to go as well, and the almost mystic feel of the Squamish/Sea to Sky area suits the supernatural tone. Like I said my only quibble is Radcliffe, who gives it his all but just never feels authentic. Other than that, it's a wickedly funny dark fairytale with a style all its own and enough energy to own it for two hours. Highly recommended.",Horns
40,3xHCCH,Escalating Bizarreness,5,12 November 2014,"Ig Perrish and Merrin Williams were a perfect young couple in love, sweethearts since childhood. One day, Merrin was found dead in the forest, and Ig becomes the prime suspect. As the whole town, including his family and friends, turns on Ig, he began to notice horns growing out of this temples. People around him lose all self-control and become totally id driven and brutally honest. But despite these disturbing occurrences, Ig remained determined to get to the bottom of Merrin's brutal murder.Daniel Radcliffe's multi-faceted performance is probably the only thing that keeps this over-the-top movie together. The rest of the cast, even Juno Temple as Merrin, did not really do anything memorable with their roles. Everyone seemed to be playing it too high-strung or too low-key, maybe that was the director's intention to keep the proceedings interesting. The eventual antagonist was particularly weak, with their final ""battle"" not too impressive despite the special effects, not exactly Grand Guignol.""Horns"" is one of those films you cannot categorize. It has elements of love story, crime drama, satanic horror and dark comedy. Director Alexandre Aja uses a lot of flashbacks to tell stories about the Ig's childhood with his gang and his relationship with Merrin. When the horns grow out of Ig's head, the film takes on a totally bizarre character that defies definition. The strangeness escalates further when flames, snakes, and even a pitchfork gets into the scene.

41,TdSmth5,Excellent and original,9,3 January 2015,"A guy named Ig dreams about a girl. He wakes up and has newsmedia in front of his house as well as protesters. He goes to his parents' house who offer him support. We learn that he's accused of killing his girlfriend. Also at this house is his brother Terry and his childhood friend Lee, now his lawyer. In flashbacks we learn that when Ig was a kid, a new girl showed up in church she smiled at him and shone the sun's reflection from her cross to his face. But it was also morse code for something. When all leave the church he finds the girl's cross. Lee repairs the cross and Ig returns it to her. And so they start a relationship into their adult lives that ends on the night he wants to propose to her in a diner and she tells him she's leaving town and implies that she's been seeing someone else, which breaks his heart. Next day her body is found. We also meet some of his other childhood friends-- Wallace who became a cop, and Glenna who always hung around with the boys and was never seen as a woman by them, so she became slutty and ended up a bartender.At night, a drunk Ig crashes the candlelight vigil where the girl's body was found. When all leave, Ig destroys the religious figurines, and urinates on the memorial. Glenna is there to take him home.Next morning horns grow out of Ig's skull. Glenna doesn't notice them instead wants to gorge on donuts. He rushes to a dr's office. There he a woman tells him she wants to beat up her screaming daughter. The office attendant tells him she wants to scream at the mother. The dr. tells hims he hates his patients and wants to do his assistant. Ig undergoes surgery so the dr. can saw off the horns. When he comes out of anesthesia, the dr. is busy with his assistant, the horns still there. Back at his mother's place she tells him that all she wants is that he leave and that she wishes he didn't even exist. His father tells him how he can get along with his brother but not with him.From Lee he finds out that evidence that would have helped him has been destroyed in a fire and that the cops have a secret witness. Ig, now that he's discovered his power to get the truth out of people embarks on a mission to find the girl's killer. He'll do it thanks to an additional power he has developed to get people to do things and he's become somewhat hard to injure and kill. He tracks down the witness. He finds who the last person was to see her alive after he left the diner in a rage. We, too, learn in the end who the killer is, what the girl's morse code message was, and why she broke up with him, instead of agreeing to marry him.Clocking in at 2 hours, Horns is a long movie with a lot of story. The past is told in a series of flashbacks throughout the movie, not in a single one as I describing above. The story is very original and the movie unlike anything you've seen. It's humorous, it's violent and gory at times but also touching and tender. The horns I must say look icky and a bit disturbing. The movie has some important and philosophical meaningful lines to say. The movie is recommendable just for the story and even if you don't want to go deeper. There are a lot of religious references here too. Most of the negative reviews don't make sense, frankly. I don't understand why some are intent here on giving this movie a bad image or getting people to not see it. I haven't read the book so I'm not concerned whether it's faithful or not. It's a movie and not a book, there will always be some variations.But I think there's a deeper level in Horns that's thought-provoking and interesting. Starting with the horns... They get the truth out of people. In their presence people confess their innermost desires. And while those may be bad, they are true nevertheless. As it is said a couple of times in the movie, the horns bring out the true nature, but not so much of the one who has them, but of the others who see them. The horns reflect, they are like a mirror that allows the other to see in them who he really is. Or to put it in a another way, it's in the presence of horns that your own horns grow. The girl in turn, brought out the good in Ig. Like the sun on the cross reflecting back on him.Another strange thing, people don't just act out on their repressed thoughts and desires, they always ask the horned one for permission first.Most people are oblivious to the horns themselves but immediately fall prey to their true feelings, except those who are wearing a cross. They are able to see the horns. They don't seem to have this inner dark self that's just waiting to escape.The horned one is after truth and is forced into revenge. While the truly evil one in the movie spouts nothing but lies and always seeks to manipulate truth and facts to suit his lies. As the saying goes, there is no religion higher than truth.",Horns
42,aharmas,Angels and Devils,8,1 November 2014,"This is probably as far from ""Harry Potter"" as you can get. ""Horns"" is literally a trip into hell of all types, with Iggy, our main character, trying to solve the riddle that might solve the mystery of his girlfriend's murder. It all looks like he's done it, and the way the script is structured, the solution might not be what we expect.In the first scenes, he's being chased by the local news, and we're given the impression that he is just innocent of the charges. It seems as if everyone in the town believes he did it. The story takes us back to his childhood when he meets his soul mate. It becomes clear that there is a strong bond between them, but it becomes evident that there might be problems with some of his closest friends, too, and this is where the clues start. It's up to the audience to figure out what really happened.Daniel does a very good job, shaping his character, giving us enough details to plant some doubt in us. He's cavorting with some shady characters, visiting sleazy bars, and it just looks like he carries some thing dark inside of him. Then he starts sprouting some nasty appendages, and this is where the comedy becomes darker and darker.Iggy discovers he has been given some special powers, and this is what makes the film interesting, as we discover that he is not the only tormented soul here. The revelations vary from unexpected to downright hilarious, and the realization is that there might not be much hope for the human race.The conclusion will appear logical to some and a bit far fetched to others, but it fits with the spirit of the film, and if anything no one can accuse the writer, director or performers that there was some originality here, taking us away from the typical horror/paranormal flood of clones we have been given lately.",Horns
43,peterp-450-298716,Agatha Christie goes demonic ....,5,23 December 2014,"""How about you guys beat the crap out of each other and the winner gets an exclusive interview with me?"" I must admit that I admire Daniel Radcliffe at this moment. He does his utmost best to shake off the mark of ""Harry Potter"". After years waving around with a magic wand as an apprentice, he aimed his attention to very different projects, soundly deviating from what we are used of him. ""The woman in black"" was a box-office hit but still had the same atmosphere as his previous work : dark, macabre and it took place in a scary, old mansion (A kind of tiny Hogwarts). ""Kill your Darlings"" is a totally different category. A philosophical tinted film about revolutionary poets and writers and where Radcliffe probably had to browse intensely through some manuals about homosexuality.And then there is ""Horns"". A religiously tinged horror with a hefty dose of humor as additive. However, all this can't hide the fact that the basis of the film is a pure romantic story about embracing love and persuasion to undermine this because fate has decided otherwise.Add to this a sort of detective story, an old-fashioned revenge motif and a whodunit theme, and you'll soon conclude that this is a melting pot of different genres. At one point I didn't know whether I had to watch it in a relaxing way or in a tense way. Some humorous parts were just attempts to be funny, while the gore horror-like scenes were sometimes laughable. I also thought the motive to saddle Ig with a pair of over-sized horns, was rather unclear. Was it because he had to undergo the wrath of God after vandalizing some religious symbols? Or was it a symbolic sign for the demons that lingered inside him ? Or was it Satan himself who granted him the opportunity of a demonic force so he could track down the perpetrator ? The original story was written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King), and tells the tale of Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe), who is accused of murdering his girlfriend Merrin (June Temple). Despite the fact that he keeps saying he's innocent, he is treated as a pariah by his hometown and is continuously chased by a gang of paparazzi. Until one day he wakes up with a pair of horns on his forehead. The weird thing is that people spontaneously confess their deepest secrets and obsessions whenever they are near Ig. This leads to some hilarious scenes like visiting the doctor, the gang of journalists, the patrolling police officers or the scene in the local pub. And always you'll see a bewildered Radcliffe who doesn't understand what's going on. OK, this was fun at the beginning, but after a few times applying this trick, it gets boring. Ultimately, only Ig's brother and his friend Lee continue to support him. Lee is a lawyer and he helps the heavy drinking Ig in a legal way. His brother Terry dwells mostly higher spheres because of the massive use of drugs, but ultimately he's the only one of the family that still believes in the innocence of Ig.Radcliffe pulls out all the stops to bring the figure Ig as credible as possible. It's his merit that you feel sympathy for this man who stands at the edge looking into the abyss. A desperate victim who by his frantic attempt to apprehend the offender, degenerates into a cruel demonic character with a bunch of snakes as companionship. The transformation Radcliffe undergoes towards the end is wonderful to see. But despite the weathered look and stubble of an alcoholic, Radcliffe continues to look like a teenager. Only Temple can still convince as the charming childhood love of Ig who's also fighting her own demons. The rest of the cast has little impact or plays merely a supporting role. The denouement is a mix of fantasy and horror elements. Apart from a few gore fragments, it's a typical story of which one could make a perfect episode for ""Tales of the Crypt."" In terms of entertainment, it's quite successful, but it's not of a real high level. A demonic comedy one does not really know which direction it wants to go.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Horns

The story bears a striking similarity to some of the lyrics. A poor young man being victimised for the death of a girl.I assume that the horns grow on his head because he starts to believe the horrible things that are being said about him? What an awful thing to feel, perhaps it's a metaphor for depression or anxiety?I actually liked the story so much that I've just bought the book. I'm not sure you get the full effect of the going's on in film form, but it is delivered well. For example: The conversations with his parents are heartbreaking.Although Daniel's accent is not always the best, he does give a very good performance and I just love the pelt on his chest! His cute butt in those jeans helps too!The only real issue I have with it, is that like 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas' and some other films, once you know the end, it's a big spoiler when watching it for the second time.An interesting way to bring fantasy into the everyday.858.85/1000.",Horns
45,Amari-Sali,"With the death of one town's little angel comes the rise of a demon, one who exposes everyone's inner most sinful thoughts.",7,4 October 2014,"Trigger Warning(s): Rape sceneBetween the ever versatile Daniel Radcliffe, Juno Temple who is just in the strangest of movies, and even Sabrina Carpenter from Girl Meets World, you are given a rather odd movie. One which has love and lust; murder and revenge; and has so many weird moments that you may constantly say to yourself: ""what the ----?"" But as for whether this is worth seeing, look below.Characters & StoryAfter a drunken night, Ig (Daniel Radcliffe) learns his girlfriend Merrin (Juno Temple) is dead and he is considered the likely culprit. Luckily for him though, his best friend Lee (Max Minghella) is a lawyer and keeps him out of jail. However, with most of the town thinking Ig is undoubtedly guilty, you are led to wonder if maybe he did kill Merrin.Leading to us watching Ig investigate what happened the night before Merrin was killed, as well as us see their younger counterparts fall in love. Focusing on the investigation though, as Ig, for reasons unexplained, grows horns on his head, he finds himself getting the truth out of people in its rawest form. Thus leading to them revealing their feelings about Ig, Merrin, themselves, and sometimes acting out these feelings.PraiseWhile in the criticism I will note the problems with this, I must admit the story and characters certainly kept you glued to the screen. If just because the things characters in this film say and do are sometimes so outrageous that I would say they ultimately are unintentionally funny. For, you see, with Ig's horns forcing people to say the truth, and giving them the ability to act on it, a lot of weird things happen. Which didn't make me laugh, since I was just so dumbfounded, but it could make someone laugh. I mean, in the film Ig's mom disowns him in such a way where I wasn't sure if I should laugh, feel bad for Ig, or wonder if his mom was sharing drugs with his brother?That aside, what I liked the most about this movie was the makeup on Radcliffe, as well as Radcliffe's performance which helped give some sort of structure amongst all of the film's madness. For while Temple wasn't that bad as the adult Merrin, and I loved seeing Carpenter as a young Merrin, with Merrin as a whole being a very limited role, it is hard to really give her praise when Radcliffe was doing most of the heavy lifting. Especially since, for the majority of the movie, she isn't there. Thus leaving Radcliffe to try to balance us wondering if he murdered Merrin or not, dealing with the townspeople who think he did, and presenting what happened between him and Merrin before she died. During which Radcliffe performs with the type of motive in which you can clearly see that an Oscar, BAFTA, and etc., is surely destined for his future.CriticismHowever, he will not win any awards for this film. To begin, the film has a run time of two hours and you can feel the length of the movie as you watch. Partly because the story sort of feels aimless in its pursuit of the truth, and with very few characters really getting established, you pretty much figure out who truly murdered Merrin way before it is revealed.But really what makes the film difficult to like is the weirdness of it. For while certainly someone may find what happens in this film funny, I won't to note the awkward moments in this film aren't like a Seth Rogen or Jonah Hill comedy. More so, and realize I have seen very few movies done by him, I'd say the humor of this film is off- putting like perhaps a PG-13 John Waters movie or maybe a bit like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.And just to give you an idea of what I mean by this: Ig goes to Father Mould (Jay Brazeau) about his horns and how to get rid of them. The Feather replies that he has rope in a shed and he can string him up, though he feels like the more decent thing to do would be to let Ig do it himself. Meanwhile, as this is all being said, Brazeau has the most inappropriate smile for the situation that it makes it hard to know whether you should laugh or just be uncomfortable. Though, while there are moments like that one which may laugh, there are also moments which seem overacted like when Veronica (Heather Graham) acts so loopy it is like Graham is auditioning to play Harley Quinn in the next Batman movie.Overall: TV ViewingA part of me wants to say to skip this in all honestly, however I do really like the relationship between Merrin and Ig, both as kids and adults, and Radcliffe does do his best to save the movie from itself. Which, as noted, is an uphill battle. But I think you'll find Radcliffe to be one of those rare actors who can make a bad movie tolerable. Something he certainly did for this movie, hence the TV Viewing label.",Horns
46,Seraphion,Nice story adjustments making it more intense,7,6 October 2014,"After his girlfriend Merrin's rape and murder, Ig wakes up with horns growing from his temples. Ig finds that nobody is bothered with the horns. They easily speak their darkest thoughts to him. Ig's friend Lee helps him for the case. A flash-back tells the past of friends Ig, Lee, Eric, Glenna, and Terry. Lee rescued Ig from drowning when he was doing a dare for a cherry bomb. Then Merrin moved in. She flirted at Ig with her cross necklace. Ig took the cross when it broke and fell off her. Lee repaired it, but Ig traded his cherry bomb for it and returned it to Merrin, starting their relationship. Another flash-back partially revisits the murder night. Ig arrived at a diner only to find Merrin sad. She told Ig to look for another girl, which Ig responded angrily to, suspecting she cheated on him. He left just as Terry arrived. At present, Ig confronted Terry about it. Through skin contact, Ig sees Terry's perspective of it. Terry drove Merrin home but she asked to get out of the car. He waited in the car and dozed off to sleep, waking up the next morning with bloodied hands. He took care to move his name out of suspicion. Ig tells this to Lee, the only person unable to see his horns, only to find now he has Merrin's cross on his neck. Ig finds snakes becoming his new 'pets', and that he can drive people to do some things. Suspecting Merrin cheated with Lee, Ig refuses anymore of Lee's help and grabs Merrin's cross off him. Lee then can see Ig's horns. Ig forces the truth out of Lee's mouth. Lee confesses to the murder. Ig learns the rest by touching Lee. That night Lee found Terry asleep. He went on and asked Merrin for her love. He killed her as she refused. At present, Lee assaults the stunned Ig, and douses him on fire in his car. But Ig drives away being ablaze. Lee tells people Ig confesses to the murder and committed suicide. Skin burned, Ig strangely survives the fire. He goes to Merrin's father, who gives him Merrin's last letter. The letter reveals the truth, that Merrin had cancer, thus she fended Ig off so Ig wouldn't have to share her pain. Ig miraculously recovered from burns when he wears Merrin's cross. Ig confronts Lee, who's surprised Ig's not dead. Terry and Eric also come. Terry already revealed the truth to Eric, now a cop. Eric points a gun at Lee. Tricking his way, Lee seizes the gun, killing Eric and wounding Terry. Under gun point Ig tears Merrin's cross from his neck and transforms into a demon-like figure, which then kills Lee.The movie tells an intense story. Being an adaptation of a novel, I think the screenplay is a nice job that did justice to the book. I've read the novel's detailed plot outlines and found that there are some major changes here and there. Most of those changes simplify the over stretched aspects of the novel and some even redefine a few characters' significance and relationships between them. I 've read book influenced reviews on this movie that say the movie deviates far from the book and tells its own story. But for me this movie did quite okay in alignment with the book. All the unnecessary details are changed to shorten the movie, making it the more enjoyable on the already long duration of about two hours.I like how the story is built so complex over the past background. The use of back and forth flow further kept the mystery going. The twist with Merrin is unfortunately not so strong and slightly predictable. Yet the ending proves to be quite a nice touch with that gory imagery.I like how the movie can keep the overall gloomy and anxious yet calm mood over the entire duration. Looking at the tag-line the poster sports, I anticipated a more vibrant mood. But the mood actually depicts Ig's anxiety very nicely. The use of sudden changes from calm into outrageous actions and words even more emphasize this overall mood. Although I must say that for me the aim at a horror ambiance didn't hit the target with me because some of the scenes are built quite ridiculously. I even laughed at some of the scenes featuring the more extreme change in the condition. For instance, I find the scene at the operation table is just hilarious, that the doctor just simply neglected his patient to have sex that the patient awakens out of anesthetics. Further I don't think those scenes with the snakes or the drug hallucinations are any frightening.The acting is quite a good overall. Daniel Radcliffe did quite okay here, losing his native accent and radiating Ig's suppressed anger constantly along the entire movie. Juno Temple did something below average for my standard. With less duration time and playing a character that only lived in the flash-backs, she couldn't really make her role look more alive. Max Minghella on the other hand did a nice job. Quite accustomed with his character's nature of calm yet capable of violent outbursts, he really did the re-visioned Lee a good job.My say is that Horns (2013) is worth a solid 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a yes from me. It's quite a nice warm up movie for the peak of Halloween season. We get to see the improving Radcliffe in a pretty complex and intense story here.",Horns

I think it is that they compliment each other. Regardless of why Daniel Radcliffe's character has been imbued with horns, the powers he gains serve toward revealing the mystery. I never felt like there was a dead spot where the story wasn't moving forward or we were re-hashing all the details: they do a good job of keeping the relevant information at the fore front and refreshing the information on pace.Why it is a great premise, it is awfully sad one, but I do feel it helps humanize Daniel Radcliffe almost immediately, and he retains his like-ability throughout the film just for the shear insanity of his situation.It is also a lot of fun to see how the power of the horns affect the different townsfolk.",Horns
48,Matt_Layden,Tame compared to Aja's other films.,7,22 November 2015,"Daniel Radcliffe is trying desperately to distance himself from the role that made him famous. What better genre to work in than horror? The total opposite of a kids fantasy series. He starred in The Woman in Black, to tepid reviews, but the film made enough money and had enough of a fan base to warrant a sequel. Don't worry, I'm not reviewing that flick; instead were looking at a film adaptation from a book penned by Stephen King's son, Joe Hill. Horns is a murder-mystery / almost horror hybrid. Radcliffe plays Ig, yes that is his name. His girlfriend turns up dead and he is the prime suspect. Yet, he didn't do it. How is he supposed to find the real killer? Well, one day out of nowhere a set of horns appear on his head and gives him the ability to see people speak the truth. He finds out some horrible things from his friends, family and complete strangers. With this new 'power' of his, he's on the war path to find out the true killer of his girlfriend.Hill is a weird guy; he has to be, growing up with King as your father. His own foray into the world of writing is just as weird, if not weirder than his father. Horns is just a peek into the mind of Hill and Alexandre Ajatries his hand at adapting Hill's work for the screen. Aja is known for his brutal take on violence, just look at High Tension or The Hill Have Eyes remake. Both gritty films with blood and violence filled to the brim. Horns isn't as violent per say, but does have some grisly images here and there. Aja was a good choice for this piece of work, even if he does seem more focused on those horrific images of blood than he is in the mystery element. Radcliffe is someone I'm not particularly a fan of. He seems to be trying way too hard to speak like a normal person. There is something off-putting by the way he pronounces most of his words that it bleeds into his performance, making it seem almost wooden at times. Horns is his best performance to date, for me at least, but he is still a weak actor by far. How much of a career will he have now that Potter is done, well, we'll have to wait and see. I wouldn't mind seeing him in more pieces like Horns and less like The December Boys, that's for sure. To say Horns is ordinary is a big disservice to the material. The film is weird in a unique way mainly due to Hill, but Aja manages to bring it to the screen with some flair. Check out Horns for something oddly fun.",Horns
49,begob,Drops off a cliff half-way through,4,4 October 2014,"The best stories uncover well kept secrets.This one starts out really well. It's witty and satiric, with the idea of seeking justice for a falsely accused man. He develops the power of getting dark secrets out of the people he meets, and the trail gradually grows warmer.A lot hinges on the dead girl, who is remembered as an amazing person. Sadly her secret isn't really worth uncovering and her character isn't all that amazing.Just over half way through the story loses the witty touch, and we end up with a mechanical work through of a second rate plot that relies on daft symbolism and half-baked religious notions as expressed through the wonders of special effects. To top it off the villain is laughably unimpressive, and the final conflict is pure cheese.Oh dear. Two hours for this?",Horns
50,Screen_Blitz,"Started off with a promise, but eventually fell flat",5,14 May 2015,"It has been four years since we've last seen Daniel Radcliffe as the iconic wizard in the Harry Potter franchise. After starring in the horror film Woman in Black (2012); Radcliffe takes a second stab at the horror genre in this dark fantasy-horror-comedy by Alexandre Aja, director of The Hills Have Eyes (2006) and Piranha 3D (2010). Radcliffe plays Ig Perrish, who has been accused of the brutal murder of his girlfriend Merrin. When he unexpectedly grows mysterious horns on his head, he develops supernatural abilities to hunt down the one responsible for her death. This movie began with a promise, but eventually got tedious.I found this film to be interesting during the first half. There were some creepy and suspenseful scenes here and there, as well as some over-the-top blood and gore scenes for if you're a big fan of gore. Then every once in awhile, there would a semi-hilarious one- liner shot out from one of the characters. Then during the second half, it began getting less and less interesting. The pacing slowed down drastically, and it got to the point where I felt like the movie was just about over, but then there was still more. Secondly, it was a bit disappointed by the lack of humor this film contains. This film sorta has a hard time deciding whether it's trying to be a horror-comedy or just a straight horror flick. Yes, the film has some humorous dialogue, but it wasn't enough balance with the weight of the film's dark and serial tone. The film was not bad, I was okay with it. Nonetheless, the film does have some flaws, and was not quite as good as Piranha 3D.",Horns
51,pyrocitor,Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb,6,25 July 2015,"No one could fault the superbly titled Horns for being unambitious, or safe. Alexandre Aja's adaptation of Joe Hill's bizarre novel toys with a glut of genres and tones, striving for the Gothic fairytale beauty of Pan's Labyrinth, while mixing in murder mystery, hipster romance, and high concept social satire for good measure. And, while it's evident that Aja falls considerably short of short of Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece, there's also no question that his work is intriguing in its own right. Questions bubble to the surface: is Horns meant to be a black comedy, or is its crescendo of camp unintentional? Either way, can it motivate some of the most anachronistic gore seen in most films shy of the torture porn subgenre? And will it ever receive proper recognition for what is probably the most courageously daft use of David Bowie played over a redundant montage in cinema history (violence of a different sort)? Naturally, the script isn't smart enough to integrate this hodgepodge of elements satisfyingly. Nonetheless, there's something strangely cute about watching Aja toy with genre like a teenager experimenting with substances at an illicit basement house party. In a sense, Horns plays as the world's biggest budget student film – a clever hook executed passionately but fairly clumsily, overlong, and plumped up with bravely stupid Biblical imagery for good measure (snakes and apples and Eve, oh my!). The film takes a while to find its footing, overly angsty at first, and sagging heavily in the middle, thanks to over-reliance on dull flashbacks. However, the premise of Ig Perrish (a name perfectly indicative of the film's take on subtlety)'s horns functioning as satanic lie detectors is weird and original enough to grant the film some momentum. Curiously, instead of milking for pure body horror, as one might expect from Aja's past works, Ig's protrusions function as a narrative device which cue not only scathing satire (a flock of journalists immediately begin brutalizing each other for an exclusive interview; Radcliffe's gleeful reaction easily makes this the best scene in the film) but an undercurrent of sweetness which blends oddly well with the grisly, nihilistic undertones. Robin Coudert's shimmering musical score (which sadly abstains from the exquisite pun of being comprised entirely of the titular instrument) and the film's sumptuous woodland scenery (filmed in beautiful British Columbia!) work wonders, acing the grim fairytale vibe. By the time we've been led through twists and turns to the film's almost commendably demented finale (Aja's animators have clearly watched Legend), we've been sucked into the wacky, oddly serene world of the film to such an extent that seemingly nothing would be a shock. If nothing else, Horns is earnest as hell (ha), committing to its jet-black fairytale with all the angsty heart in the world. Unsurprisingly, it's thanks to Radcliffe that the film works. Deftly charismatic and edgy enough to win audience sympathies even as a whiny, drunken lout, and negotiating his clunky dialogue like a champion, Radcliffe sculpts the emotional backbone of the film and pumps grungy blood through its veins. This vibe of campy sincerity permeates the rest of the cast as well: Max Minghella consolidates the fluctuations of his flamboyantly imbalanced performance oddly well, while Across the Universe's Joe Anderson is perfectly cast as Ig's stoner, well-meaning dunce of a brother. Juno Temple suffers from being more pin-up than character, reduced to lusty leering and obnoxious soft-focus lighting like some kind of fairy queen porn star, yet Kelli Garner is perfectly trashy fun as Ig's would-be seductress, while David Morse carves out a niche of quiet dignity that feels almost inappropriately serious in a film so stylistically loud. Horns may be messy, uneven, campy and perplexing, but is so daftly sincere in its oddities and innovations that it's hard not to take to. Anchored by Radcliffe's commanding performance and Aja's willingness to always push the beautiful/grotesque dichotomy in his grim fairytale land, there is redemption to be found in what far too easily could have been damned to cinematic purgatory. -6.5/10",Horns
52,Pumpkin_Man,A Great Supernatural Revenge Murder Mystery!!!,8,21 August 2017,"I caught this on Syfy earlier, and it was really quite good. Very intriguing story and interesting characters. The book was written by Joe Hill, who happens to be Stephen King's son.

Ig gets drunk and goes to Merrin's memorial site and urinates on it. The next morning, he wakes up and finds a pair of horns growing from his head. Some people can see them and some can't. He realizes people tell him the truth and can manipulate people to do what he wants. He soon decides to embrace this power to try and find Merrin's killer. I would definitely recommend HORNS!!!",Horns
53,brchthethird,"Tonally inconsistent but watchable, with a daring performance by Daniel Radcliffe",7,1 November 2014,"HORNS is a decent horror film from Alexandre Aja, but is more notable for featuring a daring performance by Daniel Radcliffe who is now far removed from his Harry Potter days. The story, based on a book with the same name by Joe Hill (which I have not read), is about Ig Perrish (Radcliffe) who is with the the girl that he loves, Merrin (Juno Temple). When she is found murdered in the woods, for some reason everyone in town thinks that Ig did it. Then one day, he starts growing horns out of his head and people start opening up to him in a very strange way.Aside from the production values and the acting, this movie also has a really great story that taps into some really great observations on religion and the media. It's also to the credit of Daniel Radcliffe and the screenwriter that you're able to sympathize so well with Ig's character, even after he starts to physically change. Still, at its core, the story was one of those teen romances that I tend to avoid, albeit sexed up a bit and with a little more graphic violence. Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple made a believable enough couple, although it was odd to see two British actors talking with American accents to each other. And, for what it's worth, their accents sounded alright. The performances were generally good as well, and nobody stuck out as being particularly bad. Other positives I'll mention are the excellent production values and some good gore effects.Now of course, it wasn't all great. One thing that jumped out to me as being particularly frustrating was the inconsistent tone. I didn't really care if the movie wanted to be serious or funny, but that it should have at least picked one and stuck with it. The scenes in which this is most jarring is after Ig has grown the horns and people start to tell him what's really on their mind. Granted, it was funny at times but it really pulled me out of the story a bit, especially when it would immediately go back to being serious like nothing weird happened at all. The other major issue I have is a bit of a spoiler so I won't delve into it in detail but, suffice it to say, the reveal was quite obvious and could have been handled better. The ending was also a little too protracted in an effort to make it satisfying, which the story didn't necessarily call for. Again, I haven't read the book, but if this adaptation is close then maybe the problems lie there. Also, of minor importance are some poorly done fire effects.Overall, it's a very watchable horror-romance-whodunit mashup with good performances from all of the cast and an interesting, but flawed, story. Fans of Daniel Radcliffe, horror in general and the book are the most likely audience for this, although considering it is a bit tamed from Alexandre Aja's previous work there is potentially some mainstream appeal here as well. It might have been about 10-15 minutes too long, but still not a bad way to spend two hours.",Horns

58,gregsrants,Great Fantasy/Horror/Drama/Romance/Thriller,8,9 September 2013,"A few years back, I wrote that the future of horror films rests on the  shoulders of three filmmakers  James Wan, Ti West and Eli Roth. While  all three of these celebrity directors are still very much still the  names expected to scare and thrill us for years to come, there is one  other name that simply cannot be ignored  Alexandre Aja.  Aja first came to our attention with High Tension (2003), a brilliant  and bloody horror film that alienated audiences due to its surprise  ending. The twist aside, High Tension was an intense and wonderful ride  and Aja was able to leverage the interest in the French language horror  film into a gig behind the camera for The Hills Have Eyes remake in  2006. Aja's next horror film, Mirrors starring Keifer Sutherland was a  bit of a letdown, but he came back strong with 2010's Piranha and then  stayed away from the directing chair and pounded out the screenplay for  the still underrated Maniac (2013) which is one of those hidden gems  that no everyone has caught onto just yet.  Aja's latest is Horns, a horror, thriller, fantasy that was adapted  from the Joe Hill book of the same name. In Horns, Daniel Radcliffe  (The Woman in Black) plays Ig Perrish, a young man in a small town who  is madly in love with the woman of his dreams named Merrin (Juno  Temple).  Merrin and Ig met as young kids and their love seemed unflinching. But  when Merrin is murdered, Ig becomes accused in the court of public  opinion and the townspeople show disfavor to Ig in all directions  harassing and condemning him for an act that he has yet to be  convicted.  Ig professes his innocence. He was drunk the night of Merrin's death  and cannot recall the events of the evening. But he is convinced that  his love for Merrin would never allow his instincts to result in a  brutal slaying.  The next morning, Ig awakens with mysterious horns growing from his  temples. Considering the town already considers him the devil, the  horns would be an incredible inconvenience except for their seeming  power they have over people which reveal their inner most and darkest  secrets when the horns are in their presence.  This too comes at an inconvenience. Ig learns that his mother wants him  to leave and that his father thinks him guilty. But Ig is also able to  use the horn's power to get answers from people around town in his own  attempt to piece together the events of Merrin's last evening.  As the hours pass, the horns atop Ig's heads become more pronounced and  the Satan symbolism continues with inclusions of snakes, pitchforks and  even a burned body before the movie hits its climax.  For director Alexandre Aja best known for his horror and over the top  violence, Horns is definitely a departure. But that doesn't mean that  Aja can't infuse what he does best into the very involving love story.  There are a few scenes of violence and nudity throughout Horns that  will ensure the younger Harry Potter Fan Club will be refused entrance  at the local movie theatre (Horns will be rated R).  Daniel Radcliffe was daring casting, but he has proved in The Woman in  Black and now with Horns that he is going to be able to leave the boy  wizard behind and we didn't think for one second that the man who beat  Voldomort was the same person we were watching on screen.  Surprising many of us who screened the film at the Toronto  International Film Festival, Horns was an exceptional film that we keep  our fingers crossed that the multiple dabbles in different genres will  not deter or confuse the audience that this film richly deserves.  Not only is it one of the best we have seen at the Festival this year,  but it is also one of more original films we have seen in a while and  fully expect Horns to end up in our Top 15 films of the year once the  books are closed.",Horns

61,bryank-04844,'Horns' is an excellent edition into the horror genre and Radcliffe is amazing in it.,7,12 August 2015,"Horror movie filmmaker Alexandre Aja has given us quite a few gems over the past decade, which include the French film 'Haute Tension' and the American remake of 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Needless to say, he has made his own unique impact on the horror genre. But where those films tend to be the straight-in-your-face horror films with tons of blood and guts, Aja has transitioned into something with a bit more depth that what he is used to with 'Horns', which is based on Joe Hill's (Stephen King's son) novel of the same name.'Horns' is somewhat of a noir fairy tale horror film with a big mix of dark comedy and romance. And with Daniel Radcliffe's starring role in the film, I have no doubt that this surprisingly graphic and hard 'R' film will be seen and liked by many. Plus, when you can get a former talented wizard from Hogwarts to play basically the devil, you say, ""Yes"".Radcliffe plays a young man named Ig Perrish, who has become an alcoholic recluse since the recent murder of his girlfriend Merrin (Juno Tmple) started making headlines with Ig the prime suspect. As reporters, cops, and people in town accuse of him of the worst, Ig begins to sprout horns from his head, literally.Like most people, Ig tries everything to remove these new horns form his head, but has no luck. When people in town come across him, they don't look horrified, but rather, they fall under some sort of trance and begin to tell Ig their deepest darkest secrets and horrifying desires, which include a mother confessing that she wants to kick her screaming toddler across the floor so it will finally stop making noise.Ig also realizes he has another power, which is basically ""the word of God"" from the book series 'Preacher', meaning when Ig tells you to do something, you have to do it, which becomes very comical when he tells a bunch of news reporters to fight to the death, where who is ever left standing gets an exclusive interview with him.Even Ig's parents and brother Terry (Joe Anderson) has darker secrets of his own and turns his back on Ig, leaving Lee (Max Minghella), Ig's childhood friend and lawyer, his best bet of beating these murder charges.What works so well with 'Horns' is that Aja leaves all of the biblical references out, while Ig slowly looks like the devil himself more and more with a pitchfork and snakes surrounding him. Aja instead focuses more on the romantic story of Ig and Merrin's relationship through flashbacks and his never ending search for the real killer.Radcliffe is brilliant here and is unlike anything you have seen him in before. The rest of the cast turns in solid performances as well. The special effects and makeup effects are award worthy and look very realistic. The dark comedy is solid gold too and might make you feel guilty for laughing, but it's executed so well that the guilt leaves and satisfaction sets in. 'Horns' is an excellent edition into the horror genre and Radcliffe is amazing in it.",Horns
62,ersinkdotcom,"""Horns"" will make you forget Daniel Radcliffe ever played Harry Potter",8,30 January 2015,"Based on author Joe Hill's critically acclaimed 2010 book, ""Horns"" comes across as a dark comedy blended with a murder mystery set to the backdrop of a YA novel if written by Stephen King or Anne Rice. Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) is the number one suspect for the murder of his girlfriend, Merrin (Juno Temple). Hung over from a night of hard drinking, Ig awakens one morning to find horns growing from his head. He soon realizes their power drives people to confess their sins and give in to their most selfish and unspeakable impulses – an effective tool in his quest to discover what happened to his girlfriend and exact revenge on her killer.On first viewing, it seemed ridiculous that most of everyone's secret desires and sins were based around sex. It then dawned on me that ""Horns"" really hit the nail on the head. If you think about it, we are a culture obsessed with sex. The proof is evident in everything from what we watch and read to what we wear. I don't think it needed to be so graphic in getting that point across to audiences, however.The murder mystery in ""Horns"" is handled quite well. You really don't know who the killer is until they're revealed. The movie keeps you guessing up to the very moment the audience is let in on the terrible secret. Along the way, we're led in several different directions to throw us off the scent. Most Christians will have a hard time with ""Horns."" Although the movie ultimately shows a man doing everything he can to redeem himself, it still could be seen as morally ambiguous. Should we embrace the powers of the Devil to do battle against evil? I think not. I do see what the film is trying to say: ""You do what you have to do with the hand your dealt."" Ig didn't make a deal with the Devil to get his demonic powers. He woke up with them. ""Horns"" is rated R for sexual content, some graphic nudity, disturbing violence including a sexual assault, language, and drug use. The rape scene, although not too visual, might be uncomfortable or distressing for some to watch.""Horns"" will make you forget Daniel Radcliffe ever played Harry Potter. Gone is the sophisticated English accent he's become known for through the eight magical entries in the film series and his turn in ""The Woman in Black.""

64,billygoat1071,Empty Schlock,5,13 November 2014,"Horns is, at times, a black comedy, and at the director's perspective, it might as well be a horror, and for the sense of its core, it is also a love story, and concentrating at the plot, it is mainly a murder investigation, added with some devilish flavor. The basic idea is definitely the main character's unknown condition of having horns grown from his head, realizing what the community sees him after the murder of his girlfriend. But the movie juggles too much in an already two hour feature, and what faults here is its only commitment goes to the weirdness and the humor, and once you see the whole of it, those elements are nothing but a design. The film seems to require more interest in its deeper parts, or else it's a total momentum free experience. Horns is nothing without its camp, otherwise it's a drag.The movie is much entertaining before it goes anywhere farther. The point where the hero notices the horns growing from his head leads to some appealing nasty humor in Ig's journey of figuring out where it comes from. But after all of that curiosity, the story jumps back to the murder mystery. No matter how much information the film spills, it still doesn't help giving any flow to its investigation. We are just watching more flashbacks, waiting to find a bigger clue. With the new ability Ig has, it could have made his investigation simpler, probably a little challenging, but the tension is nonexistent. It's just doing the same routine of hexing people and stumbling to some backstory, until it reveals its villain. The fantasy elements could have made this detective work at least fun, but it's not. This side of the story is lazy, and the director seems be to just waiting for another sequence to show more insanity of comedy and violence.What also kills the momentum is the lack of an at least decent character development. We sure know their pathos, but giving excessive flashbacks doesn't necessarily mean it manifested some soul within these people. Their world is probably built for a much lively material, but it only shines when they are poked fun at. The film has some admirable horror movie style to keep things alive, providing a good sense of schlock and irony. How those scenes are constructed, with some cool production, actually brings more enthusiasm than the other parts of the mystery. Daniel Radcliffe is always an appealing protagonist, and he does fine to the role.The movie doesn't explain much about where Ig got his horns other than stating it as a symbolism, but in the end, this certain talk turns out to be thematically vague, but I don't know. I never even read the book, but all I see here is a non-compelling personal detective work and an unclear ambition. Sure, there is a lot of promising aesthetics and a sign of an amusing high concept, but everything else is lacking depth, almost enervating the entire middle act. There is a better movie to be found in Horns, but the cons took most of the time, which is hard to think if the film itself is going to be as memorable as its production.",Horns
65,TheSquiss,Joe Hill's novel severely stomped on. Pantomime horror minus the horror. Full review #TheSquiss: http://bit.ly/1wTo9Wb,2,18 November 2014,"I'm cheesed off, and that's putting it mildly. Do you remember all those fine Stephen King novels that were completely trashed by low budgets and inept directors before Rob Reiner tackled Stand By Me and Frank Darabont sprinkled magic on the near-perfect The Shawshank Redemption? Well, it looks like King Jnr, aka Joe Hill, is doomed to suffer the same fate. Joe Hill is a fine novelist, at least as good as his dad was at the start of his career, but if Horns is anything to go by, he's in for the same painful journey, watching his work trashed on screen until his own Darabont arrives in 30 years time.Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) is struggling as the town pariah in the aftermath of his girlfriend's murder. While her family and the town mourn the death of Merrin Williams (Juno Temple) and point their clenched fists at Ig, he begins to sprout a pair of horns. Evil, it would appear, is oozing from him.The trailer for Horns was mightily impressive. It excited me and instantly became one of my 'must see' films of the autumn. And that's as good as it got.Director Alexandre Aja's ham-fisted bodge job has filtered out most of the reason, much of the fantasy and all of the horror of Hill's novel. We'll gloss over the annoying voice-over that appears every time Aja runs out of ideas. We'll bypass the donut scene that should be unnerving, a little bit funny and just the slightest bit sexy (in a warped way) and just accept that it becomes an embarrassing mistake. We'll even gloss over the pointless cameo from Heather Graham as an oddball, once again on ham duty rather than acting. These are but minor annoyances.What the &*%$£@! did Aja do to the horror? At no point is Horns even remotely scary. Not once did I jump or cringe or gasp or wince. No, that's not true; there was plenty of wincing but it was due entirely to the performances. From the screaming child to the embarrassing receptionist, Horns is riddled with pantomime performances best consigned to an Ed Wood cast-off. Heather Graham is in very good company here.Even Radcliffe, who has wowed on Broadway and showed promised on the screen post-Potter is back to the awkwardness of HP & The Philosopher's Stone. After a similar performance in What If, 2014 is probably a year he should expunge from his CV. Bring on the promise of 2015.Horns is amateur hour spread across a painful 120 minutes. It is clumsily directed, crash edited and shoveled onto the screen in the belief that the viewers are idiots too stupid to follow a sub plot. There is an over reliance on flashbacks and as for the 'did he do it, didn't he do it' mystery, frankly, who cares? Horns is a one star film that earns a second for two reasons: 1. Juno Temple, who brings light and joy to almost any screen she graces and, 2. Heather Graham. Ham or not, it's Heather Graham.Alas, neither compensates for the wanton destruction of Joe Hill's work. Somebody send out a search party for Darabont.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Horns
66,RevRonster,A little chaotic in tone but okay.,6,24 November 2014,"I've never read the novel that ""Horns"" was based off of by Stephen King's son but the trailer sold me on a dark comedy about a guy who ends up with some devilish horns and is out to solve the mystery of his girlfriend's murder. For the most part, it's not a bad flick.The story is definitely entertaining and Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely captivating as the lead character but the film suffers greatly due to the fact it shifts in tone a lot. Sometimes it's a dark comedy, sometimes it's a horror film, sometimes it's a crime thriller, and very often it's a heavy drama about loss, murder, grief and some spirituality thrown in. Crossing genres is fine but a production needs to find a balance where it doesn't look like each scene is taken from a different edit and version of the film. ""Horns"" didn't quite have this balance but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing.""Horns"" has its issues but it still was terrifically acted and pretty entertaining.

Ig Perrish recently lost his girlfriend (as in, she died, not she got lost), and he's accused of her murder. He accused of being evil, being damned, being a monster, and one morning he wakes up to that becoming a reality. Devilish horns sprout from his head and give him the ability to influence people (whether he wants to or not) to hilarious ends. The most useful influence is that of honesty that he uses to try and uncover the truth about who really murdered his girlfriend. Interlaced amongst all this are a large number of flashbacks that build up the relationship between him and his girlfriend before her murder, all the way back to when they first met as kids.Not everything works, unfortunately. The big whodunnit mystery isn't so much of a mystery as the real culprit is made plainly obvious, and a lot of plot points just don't make a whole lot of sense. The biggest one is of his accused guilt. If the forensics lab is so important to his case, why is he a suspect at all? What evidence does everyone have to instantly assume it was him beyond an argument they had the same night? There's also a revelation involving Ig's brother that makes the whole situation a bit hard to swallow as well. So it's certainly not a perfect movie, which is unfortunate.However it makes up for it in other areas, and the big one is it's humour. It's a very darkly comical movie, especially with Ig's influencing of people. His first instance is when his mate asks if she can eat all six doughnuts. She eats one, says her tummy doesn't feel good, and then asks if she can have another with a smile on her face. Eeking the truth out of people is also pretty funny, especially when he doesn't want to hear it. A trip to the bar ends up with the bar on fire, a closet flasher getting his dick out, and another guy breaking his poole stick ready to kill someone, and all this happening opposite a massive fight-to-death between rival news crews outside. It's funny and silly, but actually really dark as well. There was one bit that had me in stitches, almost so much that I missed the following scene. Thing is I was laughing really quietly, because the humour was so dark that no-one else in the cinema was laughing.The acting is also pretty good. Daniel Radcliffe puts on his best American accent and absolutely owns this rather conflicting role. He manages to put so much emotion into it, from the anger and vengeance that permeates most the third act, to the more heartfelt, tear-jerking scenes near the end. Juno Temple does a pretty good job of his girlfriend. It's unfortunate that she doesn't really have much to work with, having started the movie dead, but what she does manage is really good. Kelli Garner plays probably the most tragic character of the story (which is saying a lot) as Ig's friend (the one who shoves her face with doughnuts) with full believability. Heather Graham and David Morse also make appearances, with the former just playing your regular two- dimensional ditz, and the latter having some heavy emotional weight to tackle in his short but sweet scenes.Finally I'll just finish up with the really interesting approach to visuals. The general cinematography of the whole movie is really well done, with all the flashbacks brightly lit and a subtle vignette, while the present day is much more muted and grimy. There's also some interesting choices of camera-work, from the opening transition going through the ground and the next scene being completely upside down so that the floors of both scenes are connected to each other, to some creative use of blurring that makes things almost feel like they're not really there. There aren't many effects for most of the movie, with it only really coming out for the big, over- the-top, and maybe overly silly finale. It's good nonetheless; just embellishing the really good make-up work caught in-camera, which deserves praise all itself. The horns in particular are really well done. There's a number of scenes that really show it, like where Radcliffe gets dragged limp across the floor by his horns, or when he tries in vain to get rid of them by smashing them into a wall repeatedly.Horns is a really good movie as far as the acting, comedy, visuals, and general concept goes, but it's unfortunately let down by a predictable plot that goes into ridiculous territory for the ending. I really enjoyed it, I really did, with it's biggest lure of course being the comedy elements which I just wish there was more of. I would probably give it higher, but for the sake of being objective I'll settle for a good 7/10.",Horns

70,ArchonCinemaReviews,Pedestrian symbolism in lieu of any explanation.,4,16 October 2014,"Pedestrian symbolism and poor plot re-imagination cheapens the film adaptation Horns from Joe Hill's novel of the same title.Daniel Radcliffe is Ig, a grieving boyfriend who inexplicably grows horns from his forehead after the community he lives in finds him culpable for the death and murder of his girlfriend Merrin.Horns is about the supernatural and fantastical happenings within the New Hampshire town of Gideon. Once Ig realizes the horns sprouting from his head contain special abilities he begins his search for the killer of his true love Merrin, despite Gideon's inhabitants convictions that Ig is the culprit.Horns is an interesting enough concept but despite the novel premise is a flat film overall. The film contains themes of religion, philosophy, and symbolism. With such a rich thematic I can't help but feel that the main cause for the ineffectiveness of Horns is a butchered plot during the adaptation process into a screenplay by Keith Bunin.The beginning of the film is unremarkable. Once Ig, Daniel Radcliffe, wakes up from his drunken night to find that in the mirror the face looking back it him has horns in its cranium the film takes an entertaining turn. All the deep dark but honest truths spill out from those he speaks with and it's humorously enjoyable. With the exception of his distracting attempt at an American accent I thought Daniel Radcliffe did a fine job, thanks especially in part to the chemistry oozing Juno Temple, who plays his departed paramour Merrin.Even their sultry sex scenes could not save the washed out film. Everything about the symbolism is heavy handed, dumbed down and incredibly underdeveloped. Apparently every character to ever become acquainted with Merrin is obsessed with her purity and virtues and that is the extent of justification. There are no real explanations or motives behind anyone's behavior except Ig's search for the truth. Least of all explained is the motivation for nor believable character development for the unveiled killer who we ultimately identify in the end of the film. In having the environment of Horns be more realistic than fantastic even the slightest events seemed far-fetched.Horns is a lackluster disappointment exacerbated by its wondrous analogous setting. The platitudinous symbolic scenes are glaring and laughably unsubtle with snakes crawling and several scenes taking place in ""Eve's Diner"" and feels like someone's senior thesis. For a movie called Horns, I would at least like a feasible and logical explanation why Ig grows horns, which I personally must have missed.For FULL reviews of RECENT releases, please check out website!",Horns

72,shawneofthedead,Tonally uneven but hilarious and thoroughly winning in its own madcap way.,7,31 October 2014,"It's a refreshing premise for a horror movie: what happens when a man accused of murdering his girlfriend starts looking and acting very much like the devil incarnate, sprouting horns and summoning snakes? Is it possible for someone who looks so very guilty to actually be innocent? Horns, based on a novel by Joe Hill, takes that premise and runs with it - or, to be more precise, runs away with it. Rather than going for the full-on horror or mystery of his protagonist's predicament, Alexandre Aja mixes and matches elements of both while turning the film into a comedy: one that's quite effective and frequently hilarious. The final result is hugely entertaining but also a bit of a tonal mess.Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) is hopelessly in love with his childhood sweetheart Merrin (Juno Temple), a fact that nobody can deny until she turns up dead in the woods. Suddenly, there are journalists stalking his every move, and no one seems to really believe in Ig's innocence except his brother Terry (Joe Anderson) and his best friend Lee (Max Minghella). To make matters worse, Ig wakes up one day with a pair of distinctly demonic horns growing out of his head - horns which compel the people around him to speak and act out the darkest desires in their innermost hearts. Finally, desperate to prove to himself that he didn't black out and kill Merrin after all, Ig resolves to use the power of the horns to unravel the mystery.Of the three elements jostling for supremacy in Horns, the black, black strain of comedy that runs through the entire film is the most successful and entertaining. It's amusing to watch the horns affect the people Ig meets: from Glenna (Kelli Garner), the town slut who's nursed a crush on him for years, through to his eagerly over-sharing doctor and the local barkeep with an incendiary secret. There's a delicious bite, too, to its satirical portrayal of the media, as journalists willingly duel to the death for a chance to interview a suspected murderer. Most impressively, Aja manages to unearth some chilling moments of deep emotional horror within the comedy, when Ig finds out what his parents really think about the death of his girlfriend.The other elements that make up the occasionally awkward jigsaw puzzle of Horns don't work quite as well. The mystery isn't much of a mystery - the identity of the culprit is pretty evident from the get-go - although Aja does draw out some tension in Ig's relationships with his friends as we watch them grow up in flashbacks, and even colours a little doubt into the murder later in the game. The horror should be right in Aja's wheelhouse, given his earlier forays into the genre, but it comes here in fits and starts that are considerably more gory than scary. It's also the kind of film that falls apart the more you know and think about it: this is especially true of Merrin's rather confusing role in the story after she dies. Do the parts of herself left behind help Ig, or hinder him - and why?Radcliffe shrugs the odder parts of the narrative aside to bravely play the role of Ig. He straddles the film's multiple tones and genres very well, digging almost joyfully into the humour and somehow making the sillier parts of it work - particularly in the moments when Ig, to all appearances, is barely even human anymore. Anderson turns in a suitably jittery, nervous performance as Terry, and Minghella manages to credibly play both mild and menacing. Temple is ethereal but effective, her character defined more in her absences than in her presence.Horns isn't perfect by a long shot - its plot doesn't bear up under scrutiny, and it can get frustrating watching the film stumble clumsily from genre to genre. But, at its best, Horns finds something surprisingly deep and dark to say amidst its devilish humour and sly, bitter wit. It may not be entirely effective as a horror film or a murder mystery, but it cobbles together just enough of both elements to add some punch to the ideas, metaphors and comedy that are taking centre stage.",Horns
73,jayjaycee,Harry Potter and the Horns of Hell,7,16 October 2020,"""Horns"" is a 2013 fantasy drama directed by Alexandre Aja starring Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple.
⚪
All in all, this Joe Hill novel adaptation devilishly narrates a twisted murder mystery that combines several genres to one dark and strangely allegoric fairy tale, and despite some pacing issues in the beginning, it gradually becomes more fascinating, creative and brilliantly shows that the author has a lot of his father's literary talent in him, as he knows to create a familiar mix of bittersweet nostalgia and bleak real life, but it is Daniel Radcliffe's diabolical, well developed central performance that makes this fable an odd but one hell of an experience.
⚪
We have officially left behind the first half of this year's Spooktober, and all I can say is that it has been a great time so far. To celebrate this occasion, I thought I would give this ""post-Harry-Potter"" Daniel Radcliffe flick a watch, and I got to say that I was indeed surprised by it in the end. The only two things I knew about it before were that the novel this film is based on was written by Joe Hill, who happens to be the son of legendary horror author Stephen King, and that it was directed by Alexandre Aja, the man who taught the fear of overserving my own reflection with his mid-two thousands work ""Mirrors"". Aside from those two basic facts, I didn't know anything about it and hence went into it open-mindedly. I can see why it might have caused extreme confusion upon its initial release, because it is anything but what people probably expected. It is undeniably macabre and has a lot of brutal scenes, but I seriously cannot categorise it as a horror film. To be honest, on its core, it's a fantasy drama, but there are several influences from other genres, from thriller over horror to even comedy. Yes, it cannot be denied that it was tonally eclectic and that is what leads me to my first point of criticism. That very tonal irresolution caused the film to be unnecessarily confusing in the beginning and made it hard for me to emphasize with the whole situation. Furthermore, the pacing suffered from this flaw as well, as it was extremely slow in its exposition and took way too much time to unfold the basic structures. Fortunately, as the movie goes on, it becomes gradually more balanced and finds its right direction. The devil is literally unleashed progressively, but the more it goes on, the more genius it becomes. Protagonist Ignatius ""Ig"" Parrish (what a name) is accused of murdering his girlfriend, and even if he protests his innocence, the whole small town is against him. The thing is, the narration doesn't give it way for the audience whether he is guilty or innocent, as the entire mystery unravels only little by little. People need a scapegoat for what has happened, and since he was the one closest to her, he is the chosen one. Everyone he ever loved turns away from him, and just as his reputation, he literally becomes the devil, as all suddenly horns grow out of his forehead. Those infernal accessories entail some useful abilities and character traits that help him find the true murderer of his girlfriend Merrin. This is literally the whole premise, but how it is constructed is irrefutably clever. With the implementation of flashback scenes, the narration gains a lot of dynamic and, obviously, creates a lot of Stephen King flair as well. It is palpable that Joe Hill learnt to write from his famous father, and even if he probably is not that excited about this fact, the film profits from this a lot, as it ensures a certain kind of familiarity. While the sudden growth of horns is unquestionably confusing in general, it makes more sense when the story gradually reveals its allegoric nature. While it may seem like as if it is curse conjured by the people who accuse him in the beginning, it more and more becomes clear that it is another powerful emotion that turns him into the devil: love. Love brings out the devil in you, especially if it was taken from you untimely. Ig's supressed emotions, regret, anger, shock and love are the factors that cause his metamorphosis. Even though Satan is basically associated with pure evil, this film constructs this symbolism in an odd but fascinating way, as it turns the character into an antihero that uses his powers to achieve something pure as love. And I think that is downright brilliant. But as it is with most things, it is not all roses. One of the unpleasant side effects is that he brings out the worst in people and that he manipulates and punishes people, blinded by rage, who at times are not as guilty as he thinks they are. After two magnificent plot twists I seriously didn't see coming at all, the whole metaphor reaches its climax in the end when Ig succumbs to his wounds he sustained in the final fight with the murderer of his girlfriend, and thus the film draws the saddening conclusion that revenge takes its toll, but on the other side it is breathtaking to see that he sacrifices himself for love what makes him a martyr in some way. It is odd, but I love it. Daniel Radcliffe proved to me that he can do more than Harry Potter even if several aspects equalled him with Lord Voldemort, though (one word: snakes), but he did a decent job with this role. I think the reason why people were that disappointed with the film was that they expected a classic, brutal revenge extravaganza that convinces more with its gory effects rather than with is narrative (especially when Greg Nicotero was at work), but except for one hell of a headshot in the end, it is nothing like that. Instead, it is a beautiful allegory, almost a fable, that uses confusion as a stylistic device and examines what true love and hate can do to humans, and to be honest, I ended up loving this odd and experimental approach, simply because it seriously touched me in the end. An analysis of raw emotions rather than a gorefest, and that is why I was impressed so much. Definitely not for everyone, but if you are able to appreciate strange narrations, this is going to be one hell of a film for you.",Horns

I don't know who is choosing Daniel Radcliffe's film career path, but in a most peculiar way I'm really enjoying it. It's like he's going out of his way to break out of the Harry Potter mould but in many ways he's continuing along the same path. This film was unusual to say the very least. Unusual but oddly compelling. After the death of his girlfriend, a woman he has loved all his life, Ig Perrish is blamed for her murder, and he awakens one morning to find a pair of horns growing from his temples. Almost immediately everyone around him begins to act weird and before long he realises all is not right with his horns (duh, as if horns growing from your head would ever be normal). He sets out to prove his innocence and learns many lessons along the way.

78,TheRedDeath30,Harry Potter Grows Horns,7,18 January 2015,"I am a big, giant horror nerd. I go to the conventions. I watch obscure movies that few have heard about. I write on message boards like this about horror movies. I give that little bit of background to say that I'm always looking for the next great horror movie and have found 2014, on the whole, to be void of quality horror flicks. So, I was greatly anticipating HORNS to be one of the year's highlights. Possibly, I put too much weight on it and set it up unfairly, but what I found was a movie that was very uneven, not all that original and easily forgettable.The movie just can't seem to decide what it's going for and what tone it wants to establish. At its' central core it's a ""whodunit"" movie trying to find the mystery killer who murdered Radcliffe's lifetime love. At that, the movie actually does fairly well. I thought that the mystery at its' center was well done and had me genuinely caring to find out the answer at the end. What detracts from that, though, is the differing tones that it wants to take to carry that mystery plot along. At times it's a hopelessly romantic tragedy that seems to have some things in common with THE CROW. Mind you, I'm not saying it's a copy of that movie at all, but carries similar themes. The problem is that the line between romantic tragedy and cheesy teen romance is crossed over a few times. The biggest misstep comes about halfway through the movie. The first half carries this zany stylistic tone that reminded me a little of ZOMBIELAND. This culminates in the scene of the journalists fighting, but the movie never seems to employ this style again. It's like a different director took over about halfway through. That, also, coincides with the point in the movie where we start getting bogged down in flashback and pointless childhood memories. Yes, they are all adding to the back story at the center of the mystery, but this movie was badly in need of editing.I see a lot of reviews praising the originality and I'm just not seeing that. I am clearly not saying that I can point to one movie or story that is an obvious parallel, but having been into ""dark culture"" for a long time now I can say that anyone familiar with comic books over the past 15 or 20 years has seen these themes played out. As I said, it definitely seems to carry some of the vibe of THE CROW in a man being given powers to avenge the unfair death of his love. It also pretty closely adheres to the styles and tone of the Vertigo comics line, where it would fit in nicely.The effects are pretty good and mostly avoid bad CGI that would detract too much. It's only in the finale that the movie perhaps crosses that line into the sort of effects that you know will look dated in ten more years. This is not a bad movie, by any stretch, and I found myself entertained. Would I ever sit down for a second viewing, though? No and that's what keeps it from a better rating.",Horns

90,jtungsten16,One of 2015's best movies,10,6 January 2015,"Horns is going to be one of 2015's best movies. Daniel Radcliffe gives a solid performance as well as the supporting cast. Horns does not disappoint it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. I like that the audience does not know where the story is going to go and is curious to take the ride. I really love the confession part of the film, where the characters confess things to (Ig) I think everyone should give this movie a chance I don't think you will be disappointed. I read so many negative reviews and don't understand why. I think the writing, acting and directing are top notch. Go see Horns everyone you will definitely be entertained.",Horns
91,LiamBlackburn,40 minutes too long,5,3 October 2014,"Why is this a 2 hour movie...This could've been a 30 minute Dawson's Creek episode. All the cool special fx happen at the 1:55 mark. This is just......not a well- done movie. The book might've been good who knows...Poor Iggy, very melodramatic isn't he. I think over-the-top would quantify this character perfectly. The growth of the horns is peculiar. Imagery suggestive of the Devil incarnate. How long can Iggy the God-bearer Ignatius last before he goes insane. Set amidst the luscious Northwest of USA, this bizarre tale unravels. So many swear words, so much vulgarity, counter-balanced with very tender moments in Church. Near the beginning the tenderness gets a little bit out of control. Some pacing issues there. Merrin doesn't know what she wants, she lives in a small town and all the boys want to get a taste. Is this Hell in Seattle? Maybe. Overall, this movie just kind of tails off into nothingness halfway through, had to fastforward a bit. Then comes all the snakes, and organ-grinding theatrics that are just way too cliché. Pass this one by. Love made devils of us both?",Horns

93,themissingpatient,"Excellent, original start with horribly cliché final 30 minutes",7,9 November 2014,"Alexandre Aja is one of the only filmmakers who has directed remakes that surpassed the originals. Aja took the horror genre to new extremes with High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes and Mirrors. He showed great potential in being one of the few directors who could balance edge-of-your-seat suspense and laugh-out-loud comedy with Piranha (aka Piranha 3D) in 2010. The one thing that has held the director back from gaining the critical success he deserves is that he had yet to direct a film that was truly original in story. If it wasn't a remake, his films were accused of ripping off other films' ideas and twists. Yet, this still did not take away from the fact that when watching one of his films, there was a great feeling of dread and uncertainty. As if Aja was one director that we could not predict how far he would take things. That we couldn't trust him. That in his films, anything goes, he is in-control and we are just helpless viewers along for the ride, which was always thrilling.Horns is based on a novel of the same name and the film suffers the same issues the novel had. The novel had great ideas and shocking comedic moments but it was a poorly written, drawn out, overly generic, tragic love story wrapped in a predictable mystery that would have made for a better short story. While the film does a better job at selling the tragic love story with it's visuals and performances, what we all really want to see more of is the darker than dark humorous side. Instead of focusing in more on this original part of the story, the film stays too faithful to the book's flaws. The conclusion to the mystery is so predictable and cliché, the ending seems anticlimactic compared to how great and original the film began.Aja can not be blamed for the ending as he did not write the screenplay and no one would want to anger the fans of the book by changing it. However, Horns greatly lacks the intensity that the director brought to his first few films. There is a feeling of safety, as if we don't have to worry about this film going too far. Even at it's strangest moments, we know everything is going to work out in the end. That over-whelming sense of dread that gave Aja the power that he once had over us, as an audience, is missing.Yet, despite all the things working against it, Horns does offer some original twisted fun and is a hell of a lot better than anything else the horror genre has had to offer in the last couple years. Even an ending that's suited for teenage girls can't take away from the twisted, sick and hilarious places the first 90 minutes go.",Horns
94,chrismackey1972,Very good movie that had a lot of heart.,8,3 October 2014,"A man is accused of murdering his girlfriend, and he is ostracized by the town. One morning, after having sex with the town trollop, he discovers that he is sprouting a pair of horns from either side of his head. After that, everyone he meets tells him of their desires, be they sexual, violence, whatever. More importantly, people tell him the truth. He uses this new-found power to try finding out who actually killed his girlfriend. It turns out that the witness (Heather Graham) admits to him that she lied to the police so she would be in all the papers and get a reality show.The film is a clever blend of horror and humor without going overboard on either. As the movie progresses, it does take a darker tone. Daniel Radcliff has certainly come a long way from his Harry Potter days, and he's proved himself to be a very good actor who is quite versatile. The film was very original. It's a very sad movie, especially Marin's letter. One thing I didn't like about the movie is that they never explained why he got the horns in the first place. He wasn't an evil person.I gave this an 8-star rating. I thought the acting was great. Daniel Radcliff, as I said above, is a really good actor. Juno Temple was finally in a movie where she's not playing some bimbo or town trash, so I thought she did a good job. David Morse is always awesome. He's a very under-used actor, which is really too bad. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well. I think they could've come up with a better title for the movie than ""Horns.""",Horns
95,MattBirk,Brought down trying to balance Horror & Comedy,5,17 March 2016,"While I enjoyed the overall concept of the film, the execution by Aja was lacking and sporadic to say the least. Like many people have been saying, the tone is all over the place, at times Horns is a comedy when it should be horror, and other times its horror when it should be more mysterious. It's very inconsistent, had the movie stuck to a solid horror/mystery tone, I think the movie could have been fantastic. Just when the movie starts to get interesting and perplexing, the comedic tones come through and ruins the moment. However, the 'demon/devil' idea was great, original and chilling though I'm not sure what the point of it was in the end game? And his powers, of course, come off as very interesting and some good comedy bits arise because of it. It's hard to recommend this movie on a more serious note since I think the story was pretty hit or miss, but there certainly were moments in the movie I thought were pretty great/original. But I think that if you are having the main character turning into the devil in the flesh, you should probably avoid a comedic approach and stick to something a bit more sinister. Horns has some interesting moments but ultimately fails to maintain its mystery-narrative and comes off as scattershot.",Horns
96,HorrorOverEverything,Very Good And VERY Original,8,3 October 2014,"I'm a sucker for originality and for movies that try do something different. I get sick and tired of seeing the same thing over and over again and wish more filmmakers would take a chance instead doing the same old things. ""Horns"" is probably one of the most original movies I have ever seen and I loved that about it. It combines so many different movie genres into one fun, crazy, heart felt story that unfortunately is not going to be for everyone.Right off the bat I could tell I was going to enjoy this. It starts off as what looks to be your run of the mill thriller flick then quickly spirals into some incredibly out there. Once the Horns are introduced things just take a shift into the bizarre, and I loved that. There are some truly hilarious and insane scenes. The film does a nice job of being cleverly light and rather dark at the same time.The acting was excellent. Daniel Ratcliffe does a great job of being American, it was weird to hear him without the accent at first but he does such a good job that I eventually completely forgot that he was even British. The rest of the supporting cast did a great job, all the characters were extremely interesting and well written so that may have had something to do with it.Overall I really enjoyed this. It definitely isn't for everybody and has a pretty long run time of 2 hours so I could see people getting bored with it if it isn't exactly there thing. But if you want to see something that you haven't seen before, something that tries to be original but not too overly artsy, something with heart then I suggest giving this a try.8/10",Horns
97,pal05052003,A young man sets out to investigate his girlfriend's death after mysteriously growing a pair of horns.,6,24 January 2015,"This movie is quite a pleasant surprise. I was not sure what to expect but I decided to give the benefit of doubt having seen Daniel Radcliffe in The Woman In Black. Initially I thought he was miscast for the role but it turned it that Radcliffe's half boy, half man look helps make us more sympathetic towards his character. The story is was mixture of fantasy, drama, and even comedy. However, the best performances goes to David Morse, and Juno Temple. In fact, I always thought both are extremely underrated actors. Here Morse is your usual tough guy with a heart playing Juno Temple's father, while Temple gets a much meatier role than the ones I have seen so far as the hapless murder victim. She actually looks beautiful in this one. But Radcliffe's performance seems to fit the story very well. He was definitely not Harry Potter, but still channels the vulnerability that makes us easily sympathize with him. Yet, he cannot do serious dramas yet. However, he seems to be able to choose good roles, and if there is another Radcliffe vehicle coming up. All in all, this movie is full of surprises and manages to blend fantasy, and drama well. Feels almost like an episode from Grimm or Supernatural, sans the monster killers.",Horns
98,vistheindian,Horns – Weirdness galore,6,16 November 2014,"Quickie Review:Ig Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) is the prime suspect for the murder of his girlfriend, and the residents of his town are convinced of his guilt. One day Ig wakes up to find horns growing from his head. He soon realizes that the horns have the power to reveal people's darkest secrets, and so he uses this power to find the true killer. Radcliffe has a lot of uphill battle to overcome his association with Harry Potter, and since Horns delves into the supernatural that battle just got tougher. Fortunately Radcilffe overcame the hurdle and gave a decent performance. Unfortunately, the movie is just too long and starts to lose steam midway through. Overall it's an alright movie in the horror genre that could've been much better if some fat was trimmed off the story.Full Review:A guy walking around with horns solving murder? Yea you don't hear that very often. So sure Horns peeked my curiosity, but the question is does it hold my attention? Well frankly put, not entirely.Horns is not a completely failure, there are many things to like about this movie. First of all, I must admit I was concerned that all I was going to see was Harry Potter walking around with two horns instead of a lightning scar. It's not his fault at all, but that's what happens when playing a role for almost a decade. However, Radcliffe did a good job in differentiating himself from that franchise, even having a convincing American accent. Also despite the very strange circumstances of his character he never felt out of place. Both the characters and the concept melded well together. Additionally compared to the trailer, there were several surprises in terms of the overall craziness in the movie. The horns had the power to make people confess all their sins and secrets to Ig. This led to many scenes where things got dark, but it never took itself too seriously and was funny in a twisted way. So I think everyone will appreciate that the movie had fun with its concept and added a little dark humor to lighten the story.This movie is also a murder mystery so there are bound to be scenes that show the past and numerous interrogations. The problem is that there so many of such scenes that the pace of the movie drastically slows down about halfway through. Horns would have benefited from excluding some of the redundant interrogation scenes that led to no new clues. Perhaps they were meant keep the suspense going a little longer, but instead I felt my patience wearing thin and I just wanted to know who the murderer was. That's never a good sign if the audience wants the movie to get to the end quicker. Which brings me to the problem I had with the ending (no spoilers). Before the final climax there was fair amount of weirdness into the supernatural, but the build up to it was good enough that you accepted that world. However, at the climax the weirdness knob of the movie was turned to maximum, to the point that it took me out of the movie with some unintended laughter at the ridiculous. Also there were some questionable CG quality that was distracting.There's no need to rush out and watch Horns. It's not horrible but it's not great either. Still if you want some non-sensical fun, this is the movie for you. Just been warned it may go on longer than it should.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Horns

'Horns' is not a philosophical movie, it is just about a guy who starts growing horns when his girlfriend breaks up with him and is found dead the next day. This movie is very dark and sad, and specially for me the scene between Ig's parents after growing horns was very heartbreaking. The biggest plus point of this movie is that it is neither melodramatic nor cheesy. Seeing the rating, you may think it is.Now, Daniel Radcliffe did very well, the direction was on point and original and the cinematography was beautiful. I have seen reviewers here giving 7 star to the movie and writing nothing but praise. Why 7 then? I so want to give it a 9 but I can't excuse some aspects of the ending sequence. A certain character was given too much of a power even by being a mere human. Not talking about Radcliffe's Ig.It really makes you feel something throughout the movie, whether pain or sadness or happiness, you keep on feeling something. Personally, I can't understand why this movie is rated so low. Maybe lovers of the novel? Or maybe haters of Radcliffe? Or maybe because they didn't see any known faces in the movie. I expected a good and enjoyable movie and I got it. Ofcourse it wasn't perfect, why would it be and how would it be. But at least, it was not cheesy and badly shot. Thanks for that.Cheers.",Horns

The overall story of his horns felt underwhelming and thrown in last minute as an excuse.The acting is decent, Juno Temple steals the show in every scene she's in. The rest of the supporting cast which includes Joe Anderson, Max Minghella, James Remar, Kathleen Quinlan, Heather Graham and David Morse are all quite good, but this film really depended on Daniel Radcliffe's performance, which was dull. He sounds Irish, which isn't a bad thing except he's supposed to be playing an American. But he's shown time and time again he can't express emotion well. He was boring.All that being said I still quite liked the film mostly due to the writing, several of good darkly humorous scenes had me laughing, my suspicion of the killer ended up being right, that being said they did a good job keeping me doubting myself. I wouldn't call this horror though there are a couple shocking violent scenes, overall this is a crime drama. It had a nice story and a good mystery, but it deserved a better lead actor.",Horns

When I finally saw it on cable I realized it is perfect for a certain audience: the less respectable types who like sexy films, dark comedy and prurient behavior with a good story. This is not a great story but it is very funny in places as the horny character brings out the devil in everyone. At times it is blissful and outrageous. At other times it is annoying, mainly because of Radcliff's rants which are banal, loud, and distracting. There is a lot of explicit sex, foul language, and recklessness.

103,JohnnyPHreak,Daniel Radcliffe led dark comic fantasy that surprises all around,8,3 December 2014,"When I see the name Alexandre Aja on any project I get pretty excited. So far in his film career he hasn't disappointed. I loved his crazy debut slasher Haute Tension. It still messes with my head and I finally kind of figured out the brick to the face ending. Both remakes of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha are just plain awesome. The former is a disturbing brutal horror film and the latter being a wild outrageous party type monster movie. Call me overjoyed when the word got out to me that he was teaming up with one of my favorite actors, Daniel Radcliffe, for a horror film called Horns. I have been waiting eagerly for this film and Aja did not disappoint. Based on the Joe Hill (Stephen King's son) novel, Horns follows Ig portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe, who is a honest, heartfelt guy. He is madly in love with his childhood sweetheart Merrin (Juno Temple). But on the night he wanted to purpose she ends up raped and murdered under their childhood hangout spot. The media and his hometown looking for a culprit brand him the murder instantly. With only his brother Terry (Joe Anderson) and his best friend Lee (Max Minghella) believing him, Ig tries to deal with life as best as he can. After a night of hard drinking which lead to sex with Glenna, a friend he's known for years, Ig wakes up with two horns growing from his skull. In the process of trying to figure out why this is happening he comes to realize these horns make people spew their deepest and darkest secrets. Armed with this knowledge and power he goes on the hunt for Merrin's killer. This is not a horror movie. I will repeat that just for my own personal gain, this is not a horror film. There are elements of horror in the film. A few brutal gunshots, some dark imagery but nothing that would cross this film over the line into horror film territory. Much like many of Stephen King's stories, this is a dark murder mystery fantasy. Just like Ig, the audience is trying to figure out who's done it. Much less like The Town That Dreaded Sundown remake/sequel the red herrings are few and far between. This is IG's story and partly Merrin's. Radcliffe I always thought had talent. Stepping away from the Harry Potter films, he stood out well in the horror genre with The Woman in Black. But here, Aja lets the guy go through a physical and emotional roller coaster. Radcliffe takes IG from what could have been a poor beaten soul, but gives him heart and honesty. I felt for him on more than one occasion. He's just a sweet natured guy that has had his world fall around him. With a film of an Oscar caliber nature he's going to be nominated for some big awards in the years to come. Being that Radcliffe holds the film together he's helped along but some good supporting roles. Joe Anderson continues to shine anytime I see him. In this he goes through more than one character and brother should. David Morse portrays Merrin's father Dale with fire. There are two scenes between him and Radcliffe that sucked me in. I would have love to see more of them two sharing the screen together. Two actors that know their craft taking the material up a notch. Aja paints the film based in reality, where now a days the media and mob rule condemn a person of a heinous crime before the facts are out. There is a hilarious scene where IG gets the trolling media to beat it out literally for a chance to have his story rights. The narrative is a murder mystery built around these characters. We are shown flashbacks of key moments that set future actions and motives in motion. It's nice for me that we can see these character grow up a bit to explain how they act when older. The comedy comes from most of IG's interaction when people see his horns. Most of the humor is dark and at times vile. But it got me to laugh a few times and be stunned at others. This is one of those film that comes out of nowhere and just excites me to tell my friends to see. I had to scream it everywhere. Aja is my favorite new horror director but with Horns he steps out of his comfort zone to make a dramatic heartfelt story about a murder that tears a town apart. My only issues would be that halfway through with my inquisitive mind, I figured out the killer. But that's because I'm always trying to figure out who did it instead of letting the narrative play out. I have read that ending in the book is different, playing out a bit longer with more explanation. I would have like that much. It seemed like the film rushed to the finale and the 'battle' of sorts could have been stretched out. That aside, Aja with a great performance from Radcliffe has made one of my favorite films to come out this year. I'm excited to see them both step out of the norm again because it seems when they do we all prosper. 8.2 out of 10",Horns
104,sohansurag,"Great Source Material, Mediocre Adaptation",6,5 November 2014,"Directed by Alexandre Aja, Horns stars Daniel Radcliffe in yet another non-Harry Potter movie. Adapted from Joe Hill's novel of the same name, Horns tells the story of Ig Perish, grief stricken and blamed for his girlfriend's death, he wakes up one day to find two horn like protrusions growing on his head which gives him the power to extort the deepest and darkest secrets of the people he comes in contact with.Having read the book, its interesting to see how its visualized. I didn't have any 'faces' when I was reading the book and just like Harry Potter the book's characters came to life while watching the movie. Daniel as Ig, at least visually, fit the profile and his initial struggles to understand what exactly was going on was well done. I liked the fact that the first half introduces you to the characters whom you'd be seeing till end and each and everyone of them in the town had something off and intriguing about them. It has this immense dark tone that clambers to come out, but shies away.I was a bit skeptic when I heard Alexandre Aja, who directed Piranha 3D and The Hills Have Eyes, was helming Horns and my worries came true as well. The movie has huge tonal shifts and it somewhat took the charm away from the book. Sprinkled with equal bits of dark humour, romance and mystery the movie does work but the odd choices of injecting the same here and there was a bit baffling. Joe Hill's book on one hand focused on being horror-first, the movie on the other invested unnecessarily in mushy romance and end result being way too schmaltzy.Its been almost 3 years since the last Harry Potter movie and Daniel Radcliffe is still hellbent on shaking off his 'The boy who lived' image. He definitely shows promise but just like his Harry Potter portrayal it was a little rough around the edges. Harry Potter came to life coz its character had a persona that was fleshed out through 7 books, though Ig's adequately well written character from the book couldn't be found in the movie. The supporting characters were just intolerable, Juno Temple and Mike Mignella especially did get on my nerves at times.Horns did have some good stuff, especially the mystery element and along with some fun touches here and there and those definitely stood out, especially the scene where Ig makes some journalists fight among themselves for an interview with him and another with him walking outta a burning pub with Marilyn Manson's 'Personal Jesus' playing in the background. But those good sequences were few and far between. If I had to put the quibbles down, there'd be a ton and frankly its unfortunate that such a good source material with so much potential was wasted here. It was completely twisted and bit of gonzo fun but there are better movies to watch this Halloween!",Horns
105,SpannersGerm669,It was lacking something!,5,19 March 2015,"Horns is the latest film from Alexandre Aja, the French director responsible for such films as High Tension and the Maniac remake. He also made a very memorable remake of The Hills Have Eyes, which demonstrates that this guy really knows his stuff. Unfortunately along with the good he has also served up some mediocre stuff as well. Although Horns isn't a bad film, it is still well below what this guy is capable of. My problem with Horns lies in the characters! Their interactions with each other never really felt authentic and really took me out of the emotion that the film needed for it to carry. Therefore, as a result of lack of sympathy, the moments where the main character and his love come on screen, i was constantly looking at how much time was left in the movie. Having said this, the movie doesn't come without positives. I thought it was very funny in places and there is a moment of gore, but fans of Alexandre Aja, expecting a blood bath, will be disappointed. Lack of gore wouldn't have been a problem if the story worked on an emotional level, but sadly it didn't. Overall, Horns is very creative, but it lacked the interest it needed to succeed!",Horns

107,shannen-l-c,"A wonderful mish mash of fantasy, horror, thriller and mystery that just works",8,17 February 2018,"'Horns' is an utterly unique movie experience that had me (and my entire family!) hooked from beginning to end. It blends various genres that you wouldn't expect to work, but the result is an intriguing and engaging movie that evokes the whole human spectrum of emotion. Daniel Radcliffe's performance as the lead, Ig, is amazing and having spent my entire life unable to separate him from Harry Potter, this is the performance that broke him away from Harry Potter forever in my mind. Ig's character is intriguing and the question that was in my mind throughout was whether he was good or bad, the protagonist or the antagonist. The implication at the beginning is that he's grown the horns due to the evil he's committed, but as you follow him throughout the movie and see his humanity, you find yourself questioning that more and more. The idea behind the horns is somewhat unclear and ambiguous (which was one of the main issues I had with the movie), but they result in some rather dark yet humorous encounters that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The religious connotations attached to the horns were also somewhat unambiguous and there were certain scenes towards the end that felt a little ridiculous and 'out there' even for this movie. However, I'm able to let that go on the basis that I enjoyed the movie as a whole. The plot itself evolves throughout the movie as it weaves in and out the various themes and genres, but by the end its focus is very much on the mystery and romance. Although it's definitely a flawed movie that could've been vastly improved by clearer explanations for the horns, the experience overall is enjoyable and unique. The themes of horror, thriller, mystery, romance, fantasy, religion and crime all come together in a very new way to create a movie that is very much a stand alone in the horror genre.",Horns

109,fathersonholygore,Alexandre Aja's Horns is fluffy but funny & weird & wild,8,1 December 2014,"Horror can often look like a tired genre. The heyday of 1970s psychological horror and 1980s slashers passed quickly while birthing some extremely talented artists. This period gave way to a fairly unoriginal decade throughout the 90s. However, since the year 2000 there have been some new horror directors stepping out of the shadows to reclaim the genre. One in particular is French director Alexandre Aja. He got his first big break with his French horror Haute Tension (English title: High Tension, which brought him to the attention of American horror master Wes Craven. Aja was given the privilege of remaking Craven's own The Hills Have Eyes; one the only worth horror remakes in recent memory. Horns, based on the best-selling novel by author Joe Hill whose famous father happens to be Stephen King, is Aja's newest film, and for the most part it is a very fun, very wild ride.Horns is about a man named Ig Perrish (Radcliffe) who recently lost his girlfriend Merrin (Temple). She was brutally murdered, and everyone thinks Ig did the deed. After some time Ig caves and sleeps with an old friend of his while drinking heavily. The next morning, to his horror, Ig discovers two horns have started to sprout out of his temples, and all of a sudden people start telling him things he never asked to hear. From one person to the next, Ig hears everyone's dark, dirty secrets. At first it seems more of a burden, but soon he decides to use his newly discovered persuasiveness to root out his girlfriend's murderer and prove his innocence.The story itself is wonderfully weird. Myself, I'm a fan of Stephen King, and knowing now Hill shares his father's predilection for the macabre I will most certainly be picking up a copy of Horns to read. There's just enough horror to keep it scary, but this story really works because of its humour. Ig hears his share of disturbing tales and sadness due to the horns. It's the comedy that comes out of a few conversations (one of the best includes Ig's doctor who does a lot of things except provide help) which really got to me. I'm not a huge horror- comedy fan, though I love horror on its own, but this script worked well enough with both elements. Though Hill did not write the screenplay, it's easy to see he and his father are drawn to similar stories; the flashbacks to Ig's childhood are reminiscent of some scenes from King's novel It, both in setting and tone. For fans of horror you certainly get some great bits, particularly near the end, and for everyone else there is plenty to dig into and enjoy.My personal favourite part of Horns is Daniel Radcliffe. Truthfully, I've liked Radcliffe since the Harry Potter films, which I also loved, and I think he's turning into a fine actor. For one, the guy does a near flawless American accent. A lot of British actors play Americans on film, but Radcliffe is one of the few who can slip into the accent and never waver. Juno Temple does a fine job as well. This film, though, is all Radcliffe. His performance is incredible. Always determined to shed the image he will forever be young Potter the boy wizard, here he hurls curse words, strips down to nothing, and conveys every shade of emotion on the spectrum. Not just that. He's natural. Nothing about his performance feels forced. I was always a fan, but after Horns I can definitively say I think Radcliffe is one of the best young actors out there. In the final act of the film he acts circles around everyone else on screen.I would highly recommend this film to anybody. If you're a horror fan, Aja provides a few creepy little bits to really satisfy true genre lovers. The end specifically gets a little messy at one point. Literally. For those who aren't so inclined, Hill's story is actually a beautiful romance disguised as a horror-comedy. If you let it Horns will grab hold of you. My only complaint about the film is its use of CGI. Though there are a few really graphic bits where Aja sticks to practical effects, a lot of the film's finale was very plastic looking. I don't think there was any other way to really do it, but that doesn't change the fact it doesn't look all that good. Unfortunately these few effects near the end really take away from some of the film's emotional weight. I found myself not caring as much about what happened in the last five minutes as I did about just making it to the end credits. That being said, it did not ruin the film. Not one bit. I still love it, and I think it's another great step in Alexandre Aja's career as an interesting and important director of modern horror.",Horns

What? I could go on and on, I'll just say this: in my book, the movie is worth 5 out of 10.For most of the two hours, the acting never reflects or captures the real essence of the characters, becomes ridiculous, and rushes to the point that I wished they have never made it as a movie. WHY? because for us,the ones who read Joe's Hill writing, we watched on the screen a bag of lies and misconstructions, and what do you do in front of a liar...? you mock and laugh, and shake your head in disbelief. But honestly if you hadn't read the book, the movie deserves 6 out of 10.",Horns

While the film may seems quite a bit too stretch out but it's still really engaging to watch thanks to a strong performance as well as being darkly funny the whole way through and ends with lots of heart, and sorry to be cliché' here but yes, this is still a better love story than Twilight. There are not so many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's pretty gleefully gruesome in the style of director Alexandre Aja. As the film is consistently funny, the SCARE here probably comes from the creepiness of Daniel's look and his strong performance. Overall, this is one hell of a FUN ride that succeeds in delivering you laugh, thrill, surprise, and heart all in one place >>A-<<",Horns

113,nealvan557,Love this movie and loved the novel. Joe Hill is one of my favorite young writers and happens to be the son of Stephen King.,9,12 October 2019,"This is a movie I can watch many times and never get tired of it. I think I've found all of the tiny details, but each I watch it I'll be keeping my eye out for any tiny bits I might have missed. Such a terrific story of love, sacrifice, hate, and what it might be like to have anyone you meet tell you their deepest thoughts, or be able to make them follow your directions. If people are as shallow as this movie points out through the interaction of lead character Ig and each person he meets. It might seem to anyone who doesn't take a moment to read the novel or watch this movie adaptation, this is not about religion other than a simple good vs. evil basic plot line. Joe Hill uses the imagery of the horned Devil complete with red skin, cloven hooves, and pointy tail from Christianity to use that dark power to solve the crime. I especially enjoyed his use of this character be the finder of truth and dispenser of justice. This same writer is also behind the new Netflix series NOS4A2 and co partners with his Dad Stephen King in the newest Netflix movie...In The Tall Grass. I have enjoyed most of the novels Joe Hill has written. Compared to his younger brother Owen King, I think Joe is much more like his father in how he writes and the stories he chooses to tell. I'd not want to be anyone having to follow such a prolific writer as S. King has been and perhaps why he chose a different name to use for his novels.",Horns

What I find interesting as well as fascinating is how much more Stephen Kings eldest son Joe cares about any visual adaptation being faithful and very close to his written work. S. King has said numerous times...Once I sell a lease of my written work to be done in visual form, I don't care what is done with it. If viewers aren't happy with the movie version, just go back and read the book. I've always thought this attitude was terrible since I'm a lifelong fan of his stories since his first Carrie.

116,thomasshahbaz,Ruined by ill-judged dialogue and pointless violence,4,17 December 2014,"It's disappointing when a film-maker doesn't have the maturity and/or courage to trust a dramatic piece of writing to speak for itself. Case in point: chain beating of Ig by his friend. This totally removed me from the story and made me roll my eyes and wish the director had just made it a straight-up conversation, rather than (again) trying to ram the point home with ridiculous, OTT violence. What a shame! That's just one example of many similar moments of ham-fisted direction.Most of the performances here are fantastic, and there are moments of brilliance and heart-breaking humanity (if you can stop yourself from laughing at the horns), but the overall product is too flawed. By the end, something which started out as an engaging and original piece of fantasy is boring and predictable (maybe not so much predictable, but gory and pointless, certainly). By the time Radcliffe morphed into the demon from Legend I just didn't care anymore.Not every sad moment needs to be accompanied by sad music, not every single tiny action involving blood should make a loud, squelchy sound. I could go on. Grow up a bit more, Aja, you're almost there!",Horns
117,InMyHonestOpinion,A genre experiment with an awesome delivery.,7,31 December 2014,"Sometimes a film will be released that has a unique idea, an idea that can be twisted but still beautiful in its delivery. Books are written and as we read them we get an idea of what each character, each scene, each word spoken should be like and who should be phrasing them on the big screen. I never actually read the book by Joe Hill whose book Horns is based upon but I wish I had. I can't really say whether what the director and stars of Horns the movie produced would be to his liking but I'm sure the book would have been a lot smoother in its delivery none-the-less. It is now on my personal ""too read"" list anyway.Iggy Perish played by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter, The Woman in Black) wakes one morning after what appears to be a very big night drinking, walks over to his vast record collection, pulls out a David Bowie album and plays ""We can be heroes"". He then walks over to the window and pulls back the shade to reveal a monster amount of reporters and their crew sitting out the front of his house with people holding banners stating things like; ""Murderer"", ""You Should Hang"" and so much more. Turns out Ig (as he is known about the town) is the prime suspect in his high school sweetheart Merrins murder played by Juno Temple. (Maleficent, the Dark Knight Rises) The town for obvious reason hates him and basically wish the case was solved and he was put away. One morning after another drunken night Ig wakes up with horns protruding from his temples, the way people begin to react around Ig suddenly changes.I really enjoyed Horns I thought Daniel Radcliffe was amazing in his role, his cold stares and even his accent was pretty outstanding. He definitely has come a long way since Hogwarts. My only real problem with the film was its pace and it's absolutely no idea what it wanted to be genre. You could almost say the film has four different parts all shot by different directors and then edited together. Actually the film was directed by Alexandre Aja (Mirrors, The Hills Have Eyes) it's not that he's done a bad job I tend to more think he's tried to do too much with it and going for almost 2 hours in length it is rather long where I don't think it needed to be. The film is very dark, very twisted, it's a thriller who done it crossed with a horror and a little comedy all at once. A unique idea that's for sure. I'm not saying it doesn't work because with it being such a unique idea it keeps you entertained enough to not let go and wait for the next laugh or vital bit of information. There is some great locations used and some of the camera work is new in itself. The soundtrack was pretty awesome as well. (Can never go wrong using Bowie in my book) Unfortunately it never meets any of the genres its tries to be fully and in the end we are left a little disappointed with what we soon work out to be a very predictable conclusion.I believe this film will appeal to a large audience not for the youngings though due to language and horror elements within, overall I believe it's enjoyable enough to recommend to those who want something different than than the usual trash Hollywood and its brothers deliver. When watching it, be prepared for something a little different.",Horns

The concept is fun, full of surprises, and never dulls.The problem I am finding with great premises is that it's very hard to fully utilise them, to drain them for everything they are worth, and that is where Horns loses ratings; it could have pushed the boundaries in the fun department just a little bit more, but then, in hindsight, doing that risks spoiling some of the darker elements littered throughout the narrative.It is a violent film at times, but if you can grow some horns and stomach a few graphic scenes, then you may enjoy it.",Horns

122,fewald139,"Delightfully weird, dark, and original",9,20 November 2019,"Horns is a crime thriller with a fantasy twist that I thought would be a simple time-waster and ended up being one of the few movies I couldn't look away from. Daniel Radcliffe plays Ignatius Perrish (yes, really), a man ostracized by his friends, family, and hometown because they suspect he killed his girlfriend. His regrets, doubts, and inner anger manifest into a set of horns that offer him some unique ways of solving the crime. Some people can see the horns, others can't, and others don't care as they spout all their most macabre or depraved inner demons at him, oftentimes without being asked. This leads to some fantastic dark comedic moments and thoughtful commentary on what those we love the most truly think of us if they're being completely honest.The dark comedy in Horns does not undermine that it is a crime thriller at its core, complete with nostalgic coming-of-age flashbacks that provide more background into Ignatius, his deceased girlfriend Merrin, and their circle of childhood friends. How this group develops and degrades is fascinating to witness, particularly since there is a foreboding sense that the killer is someone close. At times I also suspected Ignatius himself, for he admits to black-outs and moments of insanity in the film. This focus on the nostalgic elements of childhood and growing up with people who will become adults you barely know or still don't understand brings a sad undercurrent to an already dark movie. There are no morally righteous characters here (save for Merrin, arguably), so you may suspect one or another at random times throughout the movie; yet, because they are so real and meaningful to Ignatius, I found myself hoping every suspicion wasn't true. The dark tone of the movie remains until seconds before the credits; there is no true happy ending, and some characters meet undeserved graphic demises. I applaud this, for having an ending where all characters happily skip off into the sunset would have felt unearned and out of place.Daniel Radcliffe does a phenomenal job here; his pain, anger, and desperation for answers are just as well-acted as his American accent. The other actors are great considering I knew none of them before this (save for Heather Graham, who has a small role). The atmosphere is dark without seeming forced; while some movies use tints or unrealistically dark sets to set a tone, it is done here with emotional consistency and by focusing on Washington's forested beauty while overcast. The soundtrack has some surprisingly good tunes (""Where Is My Mind"" by Pixies, anyone?). At many points it is legitimately sad or upsetting when it comes to the crime, its build-up, and its consequences. There are some delightfully weird scenes that are a joy to just experience; including the dark comedic scenes early on, the ""Terry faces his demons"" scene for its weirdness, and the fantastically gory climax of an ending. The fantasy elements are based in Christian mythology (focus on demons, blessings, church, and the Christian cross), but never once is it preachy and it's arguably used in a metaphorical sense. Horns is one of those rare films that is arty without crossing the line into pretentiousness; I will most certainly be looking up theories for this movie after posting this review, but as I sit here now pondering the film I'm not frustrated by its ambiguity, just curious and thirsty for more.Horns is based on a novel written by Joe Hill (Stephen King's son). While I've never cared for King's work, I read Hill's entire Locke & Key graphic novel series and enjoyed it quite a bit, though I found it a bit derivative of his father's favorite cliches. Yet, Horns is so unique and interesting in its approach that even though it hits many of the same plot points as other crime thrillers, it feels like I've never watched anything like this before. In a way, I'm interested in the novel after watching the movie, but at 464 pages it's convincing me to stick with the movie. It's a good thing the film's fantastic.",Horns
123,jeffreyhillen-364-945381,Daniel Radcliffe's best performance yet,5,6 January 2015,"Horns is a Horror/mystery/comedy film about Ig Perrish who's a suspect of the murder of his girlfriend Merrin. The whole town wants him to spend in jail for the rest of his life. But Ig doesn't know anything about the things that everybody is saying against him. Now Ig is a mess but all of a sudden he seems to get a little help. After a night of drinking Ig wakes up and suddenly is in the possession of Horns coming out of his head but also a power to find out who really killed his girlfriend.Daniel Radcliffe, well-known for his role as Harry Potter, is starring as the main character. He's been doing already quite a lot of stuff but surprisingly still he can't convince some people. Which is a pity. He's been doing a fantastic job in this film and I am under the impression that this could be his best performance in his career. I was really impressed! People should start putting the I-Hate-Daniel-Radcliffe glasses off because he honestly has done an outstanding job and should deserve an award for this. Also, Juno Temple was great her scenes with Daniel Radcliffe really worked.Going to the special effects I was less satisfied. First of all, from the moment they started using CGI I was immediately , maybe, 90% against it. Because mostly you don't get the result you actually wants. So coming to this film you saw again that the CGI was terrible. It just too Computer-ish.I think script was quite a mess. There were some story lines under-developed and then it becomes a difficult to understand the story for the audience. So they did not a great job on the script of the film. How they dealt with the flashback moments, or the things happened in the past, was well done But that was maybe the only good thing of the script. Also, I wasn't happy with the ending because wouldn't it have been nice to see Ig recover after the last battle and go on with his live, keeping the letter of Merrin in mind. I would have liked that development of character. The loneliness , he will always be.The story is just really beautiful, if you look past the bad script. I should advice people to read the book because it may show you how excellent the story is written. So the story itself and the outstanding performances of Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple were great. And so I decide to give this film the following rating. Which is 6 out 10.",Horns
124,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: Horns (2013),10,5 November 2014,"First off just let me say this, why is it that Europeans do better American accents than most Americans? Hearing Daniel Radcliffe pull off a legit accent was quite impressive. The films HORNS is directed by Alexandre Aja (P2, The Hills Have Eyes, Haute Tension) based on the brilliantly written book by Stephen King's Son - Joe Hill, which is a supernatural fantasy crime noir with elements of romance.The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Ig Perrish a young man who is accused of the rape and murder of his girlfriend Merrin Williams (played by Juno Temple who steals every scene she is in). During the aftermath, Ig loses his faith in humanity and God and wakes up one morning sprouting a pair of knots on his forehead which over the course of hours & days sprouts into full blown horns which have daemonic abilities of persuasion as well as forcing people to unknowingly confess their true thoughts which adds a bit of black comedy and sadness to the film in places but also is important as the story moves along. As Ig begins to realize that the horns are more of a blessing in disguise then a hindrance, he starts to use them more to help solve the murder that he was sorely accused of.The film moves along a lot like in the book with It employing the third- person omniscient, nonlinear narrative. The film is very well written and directed. The cinematography and locations used are just beautiful to look at, the visuals which you don't see until the finale of the film are amazing & well worth the wait when you see it.To those who have read the book, I think you will be happy with the film adaptation. To those that haven't enjoy the film!!!",Horns

One particularly bad piece of writing was the snake/car scene. As soon as it was over we all asked, ""who gets off their waitress shift at midnight, and sits in car reapplying lipstick for the drive home?"".

129,Art Snob,"Harry Potter, R.I.P.",8,14 July 2014,"Daniel Radcliffe says that he's done with Harry Potter. Consider this film as adding boldface, underlining, and an exclamation mark to this claim.If I had the option of watching any new movie with a Colorado audience, it would be this one. With a little help, you can see it as adhering to this storyline: ""Boy wizard decides to give the muggle life a try in the Pacific Northwest, only to learn that it isn't so easy leaving the supernatural behind.""I saw it at last year's TIFF, with Radcliffe, director Alaxandre Aja, co-star Juno Temple and writer Joe Hill present, and it went over really well with a less-than-optimal audience. I lamented to program director Collin Geddes after the show that it should have been presented as part of his beloved ""Midnight Madness"" program – it definitely would have been a slam dunk success in this category (I saw the winning entry and this movie was WAY better and 100% appropriate) rather than just a festival side note. How to describe it? Think of it as a very engaging R-rated Halloween-season movie that successfully meshes several genres, murder-mystery being the leitmotif. (Writer Hill explained that he doesn't like to limit one of his works to a single genre.) It has a great comic hook in that the horns bring out the worst in people -- which means a lot of great opportunities for a talented supporting cast. My only cavil was a minor one with the pacing -- and this could very well have been corrected in the current version, considering the time they've had. How does Daniel give the R.I.P. to Potter? I'll cut right to the chase: He smokes, he drinks, he swears, he f___s. Some of his adult scenes practically BEG for a Colorado viewing. Just imagine you're seeing Harry Potter contemplating a BJ offer from Heather Graham (""Gee, I dunno ... what do YOU think, Ron?""). I hope that they've been holding this back for a Halloween release. That would mean an opportunity to screen it again at TIFF, this time in the right program – which could give it a publicity boost that it definitely deserves.

The look and feel of the film was somewhat noir in tone as if Guillermo Del Toro did a Hitchcock film. Don't get me wrong, this film is not GREAT by any means, I pretty much knew who the real culprit was from the get go, it did not hide it at all. However, with the writing and the off beat characters throughout this film, something tells me that they really didn't try to hide the who, its about the journey the character takes to find out who and why?

Add to that that supernatural layer of the Horns growing from Daniel's character's forehead - which gives him interesting 'powers' similar to that of a Vampire (as shared by some Vampire Genre movies like Underworld - where memories can be revealed by touch). The horns kind of remind me a lot of Hell-Boy. The story involves a complex love quadrangle - yes, you read that right and its not a typo! The movie reminisces a it like Wonder Years in the 90s and has a nice clean, simplistic feel to it. The movie is full of twists - which thankfully are not very predictable. The characters are well defined and well written - you really feel for them when you watch 'em on screen and you care for what happens to them and feel what they feel.The movie has a satisfying reveal in the end along with a teen- wolf/Hemlock Grove like transformation - which looks pretty cool.I'd definitely watch this at the cinema as well as rent the blu-ray. its a fun date movie as well as a movie to watch with friends over pizza and buffalo wings. :) Most of all this movie didn't waste my time - which I'm very grateful for.",Horns

The girl's secret was obvious by the end of the first scene, and she was given absolutely no personality. The antagonist could be spotted miles away. The tone was all over the place. The sexual content was entirely unnecessary. The only character I actually liked was Glenna, who was woefully cliche but at least made me feel some sympathy.If you want a good film with magical realism, childhood sweethearts, and a crime being solved, just watch Odd Thomas instead.",Horns
140,wonkru,Ok,7,9 July 2020,Horns is not for everyone. Daniel Radcliffe plays the role of (Ignatius Perrish) well. But you shouldn't have too high expectations from the movie. You notice that Daniel Radcliffe likes to take on crazier roles. The film entertained me.,Horns

143,paul_marston,Better than I expected,8,9 March 2015,"I have to be honest, I have been scathing of some of Daniel's previous work, so I wasn't going to bother with this film. However, I watched the mini series he did with John Hamm A Young Doctor's Notebook, and Daniel showed that he has a lot more to his talents than Harry Potter! So I decided to give Horns a chance - I am SO glad that I did! Horns isn't your usual horror story and in my opinion is better for it! It's the story of a man coping with heartbreak and all the while under suspicion for the murder of his childhood sweetheart.Early in the film the main character Ig (Radcliffe) starts to grow horns. These horns make all those around him with a guilty secret unable to hide this secret and they are compelled to announce it to the world and enact it! Only if you have sin will you see the horns! As you can imagine everyone in the town has skeletons in their closets. At first it is overwhelming for Ig, however as he grows accustomed to his new powers, Ig resolves to find out exactly who killed his girlfriend.The only person who is unable to see the horns is his best friend Lee who is acting as his attorney - the only person in the town not convinced of Ig's guilt! Eventually however we discover exactly WHY he cannot see the horns, as he is wearing Ig's dead girlfriend's necklace! When this is removed, we discover exactly how Lee knows Ig didn't kill her - because Lee did it! Ultimately this is all standard fair for this kind of film, but what is so refreshing, is the way Daniel seems so convincingly to convey the sheer turmoil of someone who has lost the thing most dear to them.It's refreshing, and enjoyable, and I liked it!",Horns

The special effects were great as well as the soundtrack. But thats it. The movie starts with a gender and than finishes with another. Honestly i don't understand if the movie is a comedy, horror, thriller or fantasy, because the way that the storyline is put together give us a sense that not even the director have a clue of what the hell is doing. I did like some parts, specially the parts were is supernatural powers give him the possibility of knowing every secret of every person in town. But that's it. Were is sense of growing up horns? Why did it happened? It was God or the Devil? And is it possible for the dad not knowing her daughter had a cancer? Please...

It's like an adult themed fairy tale, a cross between Bridge to Terabithia and Martyrs. The symbolism and themes throughout spark deep reflection and thought. There are some rather disturbing scenes but they are so creative, so artistic. See this and you will not be underwhelmed.

150,merrilanil,Horns? More like Horny and Puny,2,14 October 2014,"So here I am excited with the idea of watching my favorite book turn into a cinematic magic and elated at the thought of seeing some of the strongest characters I have ever read in a book come alive on screen. Five minutes into the movie and I am crying my heart out and not because it emotionally stirred me but because the movie was horrible.If you haven't watched this movie till now, then don't. You will avoid yourself some pain. Read the book instead and you will survive the tortureThe movie is more of a low budget porn movie where the actors are all acting weird probably under the influence of some heavy dope. Bad actors, bad lighting, confusing expressions on everybody's face, bad screen rendition of a perfectly good scripted book and bad graphics(well I will give it that the horns was pretty impressive but wait till the end and you will realize why I am shouting bad graphics)Half of the actors in this movie are English and they have been given the roles of core American characters and the whole movie thereon is a struggle from these actors to get rid of their British accent and sound genuinely American fighting their natural instincts. News Flash: Did not work and certainly did not fool me. Watch the trailer and you will realize what I am talking about. The struggle between the accents is starkDaniel Radcliffe. This guy practically immortalized the character of Harry Potter and now whenever we sit down to read the book, it's probably his face that comes into our mind and to think that the same guy just messed up a perfectly good script and movie is utter disappointment. Almost all the actors including Heather Graham, Juno, and Daniel are all acting like some low paid porn stars.In the book, one of the most powerful and crucial characters Is that of Lee and sadly in the movie, it's his character that is the most underdeveloped one. Max Minghella, who plays this character, has not been given much to work around and the result is devastating.The only good part in the movie is where you get to see David Morse, who plays the character Merrin's father. He appears barely in two to three scenes and those are the best. Emotionally strong and captive.Joe Anderson and Juno Temple are definitely a mismatch for the characters. Juno has one of the strongest role in the whole movie but either she did not have a whole lot of scope or she lacked in her part, either way her role ended up being a wallflower. Joe Anderson was in the movie to come off as a drug junkieyou got to be kidding medid the crew even read the book?The movie was more of a spoof of a perfectly good book. A total disaster right from the cast to acting and screen adaptation. It's a porn movie and nothing else to it. The saddest part is that Joe Hill's book was a complete script in itself and this could have been a pretty good movie if it had been treated rightly",Horns
151,rapidcereb,Worth Watching,6,8 October 2014,"I wasn't sure what to expect from the pictures of this movie. Having watched it I would say at points it does have a bit of B movie appeal to it, while other parts are well shot. Overall I liked the look of the whole movie. Lots of colors and a few psychedelic scenes. This being said, some of scenes were stretched out and seemed a little redundant.I would say this is Daniel Radcliffes best role since the ""harry potter"" movies, though I am not a fan. The role he plays in ""Horns"", offers a polar opposite to what he played in ""kill your darlings,"" and I think he did a pretty good job.The philosophy behind this movie is interesting, and provides a fresh change on what constitutes an image of both good and evil. I liked the progression of experiences the main character went through, and i always enjoy watching Juno Temple in all the work she does, as she brought a nice light hearted, feel good energy to the movie (as usual).At times this movie reminded me of ""stand by me,"" with a touch of Steven Kings ""needful things."" Otherwise was a 'fairly' interesting (psychologically accurate) murder mystery, while at the same time offering enough to ponder with the spiritual aspects taking place.As the movie continued to progress, I was thinking that it was just going to be another generic murder case movie, with some supernatural stuff thrown in at a surface level in order to try and make it seem like something new. But, while it was another murder case solving mystery, there were enough other elements added to mix to make a good stand alone film, and make it one that is worth the watch for a good time at the movies!",Horns
152,indianajones79,Interesting if nothing else.,4,19 December 2014,"Young Ig Parrish is reeling from the murder of his long-time girlfriend. That he is the main suspect makes the tragedy all the more unbearable.Ig wakes one morning to find he had begun to sprout horns from his head. People notice, but no one seems to care. Stranger still, the horns seem to have a bizarre effect on people: they just can't seem to keep anything to themselves, their innermost thoughts nor their darkest, most closely-guarded secrets. Gradually realizing the potential implications of this new ""power,"" he sets out to discover what really happened to his beloved.Widely panned by most who've seen it, I found it to be enjoyable throughout. At turns comedic and heartbreaking, it kept me guessing till the bitter end... Or bitter-sweet, depending on your take.Well-acted and low-budget, the effects are not stellar, but also not the driving force of this film.

153,poetbard,good until the end.,7,22 April 2015,"Radcliffe is very convincing as Iggy Perish in this dark fantasy, in which he is accused of killing his girlfriend. In a series of flashbacks the plot is developed from childhood on to the tragic murder of his girlfriend and the subsequent investigation Radcliff grows devil-like horns. With these he develops a dark power that causes almost everyone he talks to reveal their innermost evil desires. The plot takes many unexpected and dark twists which Iggy discovers the dark side behind everyone he ever knew. The problem with this film is the ending. It is overdone and very predictable and thus seriously undermines the quality of the film. All the other actors were excellent in their roles. The direction was also good until the ending when is became ridiculous. The ending should have been another clever plot twist, had it been so this would have been a very original horror fantasy and I would have given it a 9 instead of a 7",Horns

Movie followed the book story. Not letter by letter, obviously, but close enough so that base was there. I understand some thing translate badly to the screen, some scenes don't help (flashbacks mostly) etc. Then around the middle it just goes off the rails and starts spinning its own tale.And it's not just these deviations, it's that story starts going downhill once it does.

155,Chrismeister,An Adulterated Mess,3,9 November 2014,"On the outset Horns appears to be a strange and unique concept, and it succeeds in being both however it is also an adulterated mess. For it's completely out there premise is seems incredibly tame. The restrictions of its 15 rating are apparent here; clearly the choice was made to be accessible for a wider audience, the ones who would see Daniel Radcliffe as an essential draw for a film. It does play towards the more juvenile audience members with the over exaggerated action and characters. The results are nothing short of mixed. The performances in the film are good with the script they are given. Daniel Radcliffe has to be commended for his choices as an actor after Harry Potter came to a close. The results of these choices have not been completely triumphant, yet it is refreshing to see a young actor want to do more creative work. Juno Temple, Max Minghella and the rest of the cast offer acceptable yet forgettable work. Flashbacks do all the heavy lifting to establish character motivation which in the end is detrimental to not only the actors work but also the structure of the narrative. On the whole it felt rather cluttered and unstructured, more of a series of crazy situations rather than an all-encompassing plot. And after the third or fourth moment people lose their minds, it loses it fun factor and becomes more of a chore to sit through repeatedly. However it was trying to be different and in that respect I can appreciate it more. The film clearly tries to combine genres which does give it a fresh feel, yet ultimately is why it fails to make it work. I wasn't sure how to feel as one character has a drug overdose just after a supposed funny scene of two cops realising they were gay. This becomes a film I wanted to enjoy but I simply couldn't, there were too many questionable choices made in the production and script such as musical choices and character design. This film treats the audience like a child and spells everything out for us. I can't help but feel if the final shot was removed there would be some genuine satisfaction from a second watch, now there is none. If this story was given to a more veteran director and the script was matured this could have been a great, alternative film. But for now we have only this.",Horns

Daniel Radcliffe's performance is so believable and impressive. I was impressed with the originality of the story, the soundtrack and special effects.

Don't gay people deserve happiness?What is the point other than to display that you don't like homosexuals?It was a point in the film that did NOT progress the story along- there was NO reason to do that.

It appears charming for a brief moment, with a mystery in the air. After 5-10 minutes you start asking yourself: 'Did I miss something at the beginning?'; 'Was I listening to the opening dialog carefully enough?'; or 'Should I rewind it and watch again?' This confusion keeps your attention for the following 30 minutes, but then strange things start to happen, and I don't mean strange in a good way... Rather strange in a 'what-the-heck' kind of way. Slowly, the movie starts going downhill... The plot, the characters, the music... you name it. The closer the end -- the more confused you get, asking yourself 'How did this movie turned into a horror, sci-fi, fantasy, gore... all mixed up, and badly at that?'

It is a brilliant combination of horror-comedy-crime-romance, it is funny,surrealistic, fresh and does not take itself too serious. Horns reminded me of ""Kick ass"" because ""Kick Ass"" also can be described in a similar way. I wish more movies were as daring as Horns. I prefer a movie that tries to be original and out of the box even when it fails from a movie that ""plays safe"" obeying to cinematographic conventions. Radcliff is not an actor i admire a lot, however he is great in this. I believe that his next movies will make me like him more. Above all, Horns is a romantic fairy tale.

Daniel Radcliffe is excellent as the spurned American boyfriend but so is Max Minghella, Juno Temple and Joe Anderson. They have equally good chemistry with each other and shine brightly in their respective roles.3. The screenplay is top notch. You will not feel bored throughout this film as it keeps you hooked on every scene, be it the comedy scenes, or the thrilling ones. AND, there is a touch of emotional depth added (not too melodramatic and not too stale) to give this movie a flare.CONS:1. The scenes do get cheesy sometimes, but only for a few seconds each time, so you won't be too annoyed with them.2. There isn't enough ""shock effect"" (a twist) at the end of the movie. Actually, these ""flaws"" are probably just me being picky.

I know he does not hold back on the gore and this movie does not as well. Some things I noticed were cgi but for the most part we're really good effects. I was actually pretty surprised with this film and did get drawn to story, I was glad to see it was a lot more to the story than what I imagined. First half has some funny moments with some dark humor sprinkled throughout then towards the second half it does take a darker turn and shifts to a more serious tone. Daniel Radcliffe does a fantastic job and makes this character feel believable. It's a strange movie but i love the originality and I really did enjoy it trying something different. I recommend going in without much knowledge of this film and I think you will be surprised like me.
SPOILERS LISTED BELOW****This is a wild movie and I appreciate that it holds nothing back / goes for it. I thought it was interesting that everyone, without a doubt, believes Ig killed his girl friend except for a few people mainly just his friend (his lawyer) and his brother.
The flashbacks when they were younger did flesh out some of the characters. Then After he wakes up with the horns, I was fascinated with the different powers they offered which gave us some quality scenes throughout. (for instance the scene where he makes the reporters fight each other for an interview.)
It brought out some darker moments as well like when we get to his family (especially his brother lol) and finally the big reveal at the end with his lawyer friend after he takes the cross necklace off. I did catch that his friend might have secret feelings for his girl but I like how it diverts our attention into thinking that they were running off together. In fact, takes another turn and she is actually sick and he's just crazy, which I felt had a little more impact especially when the truth is finally revealed about what happened.
It does get a little crazy at the end but I thought the transformation looked pretty good when Ig finally takes off the cross again.I am still left with a few questions but overall I was pleased with this movie.
My actual rating is a 8.1",Horns

I was left wondering what direction Daniel was given when the only way he appeared to know how to act drunk was by swaying all over the place, as if he was on a ship in a storm. The script was stilted, character development shallow, cringe-worthy obvious statements. This is not for an audience who enjoys a level on intellect which doesn't require plot points to be spelled out, and deliberately written into dialogue. I understand the desire to cast Daniel Radcliffe, because of the media coverage he'll pull in, but I do not understand it from the perspective of anyone who would want to work with good actors, and make a decent movie.

175,JakeJarvi,A beautiful looking movie with a great performance and too much reliance on the book,7,7 November 2014,"I enjoyed the hell out of Horns, and I'm not going to turn this into a movie-to-book-to-movie discussion, but I find it really interesting that my gut reactions to the film and the book ran in exact opposition to one another.When I started reading the book, I almost had to put it down I was so nauseated at the idea of hearing the worst aspect of people brought out into the open for 370 pages (and I'm a horror fan). Luckily, right when I was hitting my breaking point, we got further into the story, the mystery, the larger themes, and that book is really outstanding and complex. I loved it as an exploration of perception and and it made me feel really weird and intrigued the whole time.At the start of the movie, I loved all the darker side of people stuff and it was clear that the filmmakers and cast where having so much fun with it. The further we got into the film though, the more muddled and illogical the motivations and actions of the characters became. It's a problem with the screenplay. I feel like the narration was Blade Runner'ed onto it in order to try and get us to sympathize with his actions. Instead the reasons behind his actions could have been shown to us with a few quick lines of dialogue between the characters without getting too exposition'y. In the movie, punishing his brother seems out of place and the reasons Ig states are a little contradictory and confusing. The whole ""You're going to live and suffer"" thing? And the ""You're going to feel what she felt?"" That seems too indicate Ig already knows everything that happened, which he doesn't. From this point on, the movie feels a little sloppy. Similarly, his punishment of the Heather Graham waitress seems like a tacked on scene that muddies Ig's character and makes us wonder why he's wasting his time vilifying himself. Sure, she's a lousy person, but everything he's done up until that point has been productive in one way or another. This is the one petty act of vengeance and it seems odd. (I also don't remember it from the book, but I read it several years ago, so maybe I felt similarly conflicted about it then and memory-scrapped it.) As I said, I still enjoyed my viewing of the film, but I could see why people started sharpening their pointed comments while the second half played out. Like him sprouting wings before demon'ing up? Not great. I understand it hearkens back to the whole ""every devil started as an angel"" thing, but it was the point where I finally thought--hokey. Solid imagery, not awesome execution. He hadn't had wings or heavenly imagery throughout his whole ordeal, so to bring them in felt cheap and gaudy. Better to tear the cross off and burst into flames. Go straight for the rage/revenge imagery than muddy it up with him flying into the air.All in all, I thought the flick looked great, contained a lot of really effective imagery and scenes, and Radcliffe--as everyone has been very quick to point out--is outstanding. I don't agree with the tonally conflicted thing that a lot of reviewers have been throwing out there, because I think both of the tonal extremes could have been used to great affect in this picture, I just think they knew how to pull off the first tone, and threw too many devices, theories, and convoluted intentions into the second half.Side note: I appreciate how much nudity was in this flick, and the fact that at least one dude got his dick out, but it should have been a really hot, in-great-shape guy. All the naked ladies were smoking hot, the naked guy was cast for comedic effect instead of titillation. Let's see more hot, erect dudes in cinema, so they don't take our naked starlets away.",Horns

I am a person who has watched many many movies in my life, from the beach party movies, gone with the wind,Steel Magnolia's, the godfather(1 and 2 the best), a perfect getaway(my very favorite movie of all time), Gidget, Jaws (number 2 best movie), as well as all the stupid worthless movies that have come out, especially in the last 5 years or so, (40 something, sex tape, and other com rom crap). When a movie makes me laugh, cry, and be at the edge of my seat, I count them as something better than average, as something special. This movie fit the bill. I suggest others watch it and decide for yourselves. All I can say is perhaps the bad reviewers like to feel self important and elitist and will post bad reviews about everything. Good for you. But I don't believe that helps. I never read ANY professional reviews because of the exact reason stated above, no true real reviews. Professionals either are paid well to ""love"" a movie, or they are pretentious, elitist idiots who like to seem ""special"". I do not believe or respect professional reviews and definitely would not base my decision on whether or not to see a movie on their reviews. I would like to think that normal people would be, well, normal. I guess thats not always true.

The scene in the doctor's office waiting room had me in stitches! I love that this film was completely un-formulaic and original.

To me, the bottom line is this:1) I was genuinely interested who the killer was; 2) I thought the love story was rather touching; 3) The acting was good; 4) A lot of the movie was quite entertaining and some parts of it pretty funny.Certainly, you can easily find flaws in this movie: the ending is a little underwhelming, the character development is a bit sketchy and etc. However, none of that spoiled the viewing experience for me.

This is not a book - so throw away that comparison. Which film has ever been as good as the book? Keep that question in mind. It will get many to want to get even more out of the story's framework by reading/buying the book (* novel by Joe Hill) though, which can be nothing but a good thing. I'll keep this short.I was totally taken by this film, which doesn't often happen. I would shortly describe this: It's a story about love and a thriller with some fantasy-horror-seasoning and loads of intelligent dark humor baked together into a very rare, tasty dish. It got me intrigued in suspense, what'll happen next. Many surprises. It got me laughing aloud so many times. It got me to ponder my own dark sides of thought. It got me to feel many things on a wide scale, reflecting my life, myself as a person, life in general and the wonderful thing (which is rarer in these days, especially in horror-labeled films) was that it was very uplifting.Even thoug everything is well made, I think in this case it's not even that much about how exactly everything is put together as HOW ABLE THE VIEWER is to use the story and find messages and roots for further thoughts while at the same time be just absorbed and entertained in a way that is seldomly - or maybe never before seen in this way combined.

190,emma-190-611245,"Great Source Material & Acting Hurt by Music, Cinematography & Adaptation",7,7 November 2014,"Initially disappointed that this movie was only given limited release in the States, I now understand why - and though I recommend people watch it, if given the choice between film & book - read the book, it is brilliant. Now, as for the movie - the good & bad: All the acting in this film is spot on. Daniel Radcliffe, Joe Anderson, Juno Temple and Kelli Garner are each superb in their roles. As Ig, Mr. Radcliffe hits just the right tone of a grief-stricken, broken-hearted lover caught in the cross-hairs of hatred - of an entire town. His anger, betrayal, and joy (in flashback) feel real. Ig's wonder combined with his utter certainty in a future with Merrin are sweeter and sadder because the viewer knows her fate from the outset. Ig's predicament, waking with horny growths, is played with the just right tone of disbelief, resignation, and bitter acceptance. Joe Anderson, as Ig's older brother Terry, shows depth and nuance as a guilt-ridden, cowardly brother sliding into the abyss of addiction over his role in Merrin's demise. Kelli Garner, as Glenna the pathetic town tramp yearning for real love, handles the dichotomy of her character without going over the top - which could have been an issue for her scenes. Juno Temple isn't given as much to do and I wanted to see more of her - acting, not necessarily her lovely form. However, what she did with the material she was given was captivating. She's the life of the movie, in her death - and her very presence and lack of it, the catalyst for everyone else in the film. (A note to the filmmaker - yes, we need to care deeply for Merrin so that we care about her loss and Ig's profound grief. But we need to understand HER - not just worship her beautiful form). She has a mind, a soul, motivations, and transformed Ig into the good man he was - with her strength of character, resilience, laughter, pain - her life force, if you will. Mr. Aja, consider directing with a woman to better portray women as a multi-dimensional beings in your films.) Max Minghella, so fine in everything else he does, doesn't work in this part. Lee is a charmer, an earnest do-gooder crackling with understated and tightly leashed resentment. We miss all of this in Mr. Minghella's (too) reserved portrayal of a true socio-path. It is possible this missed opportunity has less to do with acting than with direction - a real possibility when combined with Heather Graham's overly manic waitress, shrieking her lines while making crazy, wide-eyes at the camera. The actors playing younger versions of Ig (Mitchell Kummen), Lee (Dylan Schmid), Glenna (Laine MacNeil), Merrin (the phenomenal Sabrina Carpenter) and Terry (Jerrod Ager- Foster) deserve special mention as being truly talented, unaffected and believable. I look forward to seeing them in future roles. Perhaps the largest issue I had with this film, it's impact ever present, had more to do with the original score and cinematography. The wide sweeping views of the mountains and valleys in various cloud and light, combined with music that felt like recycled Carter Burwell arrangements gave the film the feeling of a Twilight movie installment. A problem that cheapened the production value and could easily have been avoided. This loomed even larger than the script v. source material issues. Read the book, and bring it to life when the DVD comes out. Radcliffe, Anderson, Garner & Temple will make the time worth it.",Horns

The director Alexandre Aje has made some other interesting bloody horror movies before like High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes before. This looked like an OK movie with an interesting story, a mystery murder with a guy growing some bad-ass horns in his forehead. But I never got around watching it at the time. Now almost two years later when I was looking for a new book to read I came across the title again. With some pretty decent reviews and the fact that the author is Joe Hill, the son of horror author Stephen King (a fan of mine when I was in my teens), I decided to read it and I really liked it. It wasn't so much of a horror-read as I wanted it to be but still it was a fun and suspenseful read.I watched the movie two days after reading the book, so I had it fresh in my mind, maybe to fresh. The thing with the movie is that too much is changed from the original story. Characters are removed or exchanged with another, essential parts are deleted and the storyline is changed. The inner core story and plot is intact but still it's not the same. I'll not go into any detail and spoil anything but just say that I was disappointed and it made me not like it as much as I perhaps could have had I not read the book beforehand.Anyhow... I believe Daniel Radcliffe does a good job portraying Ig Perrish, but really... you shouldn't read the book first.",Horns

I must say I was not disappointed! Sure you have your played out love romance and sure you have your basic small, depressing town with it's typical views, but that's where for me the basics ended. The idea behind this film I found to be quite novel and I was really interested to let the film unfold before me. Daniel does a great job acting and the other actors are believable as well. The tension builds slowly during the film and the plot twists and explanations given all fit in really well. I especially liked the ending, since it was both visually very engaging and a bit emotional. If you are looking for a full-on, take you for a ride thriller, I suggest you skip this title. It's more of a slow building, nicely paced suspense piece. All I can say is, give this movie a go, you won't be disappointed.",Horns

That being said, I saw this movie after I had already read the book. Now, this makes the movie a bit harder to watch. The book was excellent, with constant switches from past to present, heavy symbolism and connection back to reoccurring themes. In my opinion, the book was so excellent and well put-together, that a two hour movie had to struggle to just keep up. In fact, that is what this movie did. It overlapped characters, ignored some very important story lines (such as the origin of the horns), and just didn't feel as deep as the book did. However, this can be forgiven. For, the movie was well put-together. While they didn't have enough time to be as deep as I would have hoped, the movie was able to make an intriguing story, even if it was different than the original novel. My sister had not read the book prior to watching the movie, and she absolutely loved it. This is proof that the movie is excellent to movie watchers, with heavy themes and dark comedy. I still very much enjoyed the movie, even though it was different than what I had been hoping for. But, they can't be held to blame. The movie had two hours to achieve what Joe Hill had 440 pages to accomplish. And while different, it was achieved. Would recommend, but be wary if you've read the book.",Horns

It doesn't invoke any sympathy on my side and I don't even feel like rooting for the characters except for Glenna (played by Kelli Garner, which was good in this movie although she had little scenes).

It takes reasonably good actors and has them acting badly, reading badly written lines and behaving in completely illogical ways (and I don't mean when under the influence of Ig's horns).

It was really brutal in all honesty, and if you cry easily you probably will find yourself sobbing. Or maybe just horrified. A lot of things went wrong though. The evil character was almost too evil that it kind of detracted from the rest of it, like when he laughed at the Dad's death. Really, there was just too much exaggeration all around.

Not since David Lynch's Twin Peaks, have I seen the subtlety of magical realism enacted, and acted, so well by Daniel Radcliffe.There are many films that utilise magical realism, but it takes real visionary's to sell surrealism as if there's nothing going on here until the reversal.I have watched this film several times and each time I'm enthralled by the way it snakes (pardon the pun) into my mind before I know what's happened. I think the director and actors, especially Daniel Radcliffe, told this story well. It has the markings of a cult classic film.",Horns
207,capojeff280,Horns is a great film follow up after Harry Potter,9,12 May 2016,"You would think that Daniel Jacob Radcliffe would be type cast, with a character like Harry Potter. However, that is not the case with the master pieces of a film called ""Horns"". I am not a large fan of horror, but this film is more of a murder mystery, that keeps you guessing on who done it, to the very end. Daniel Jacob Radcliffe character, girl, has been murdered and he knows, he didn't do it. For some reason he grows horns and sees everyone secret desires, which leads to him to the truth of finding the murder of his beloved girlfriend. Its one of the thoughts stories when you fall in love with your first girlfriend and you will be happy forever, well this one kind of ends that way. Note to self while watching this film, don't trust anyone, and stay focus on the main character, even though me might be weird to look at. This film show a good creative why of how evil is used to find good at the end.",Horns
208,jessica_panza,Totally worth watching,7,10 November 2014,"This is a great movie. However, I didn't like the fact that so much had been changed from the book. The book was very well written and I loved the way Joe Hill had laid out the plot. I can't say much without giving away facts about the movie that will ruin the experience for you. If you did not read the book, you'll definitely like the movie. However, it may be debatable whether you'll enjoy it or not if you have read the book. Daniel Radcliffe and Joe Anderson do a great job in this film. Max Minghella, I can't say anything one way or the other about because he is completely different in the movie as he was in the book, which almost ruined it for me. Juno Temple is my biggest complaint. She is HORRIBLE. Very annoying voice. She talks like a little girl who also sounds drunk. Merrin is supposed to be the most beautiful girl in town that everyone loves and I think the only reason Juno Temple got this role was because of her perfect body and willingness to do nudity. She definitely did not prove herself or make the audience love her at all. She barely has any lines in the book and I see why. She's a brutal actor and they could have found someone way better. The ending of the movie was the best part. The direction and special effects on this scene was phenomenal and what saved the movie for me. By the way, my boyfriend, who didn't read the book, loved the movie and had no complaints other than Juno Temple being such a bad actor. He liked the storyline, the way the plot played out, etc. I understand that when converting a book to a movie, things need to be changed and cut, but they didn't way too much changing and cutting for this film. A very important part of the book where we see the murderer slowly torture his own mother and see inside his head, was completely left out. A sociopath who is not a sociopath at all in the movie.",Horns
209,suprawhat95,I liked it...,10,3 February 2015,I thought this was a good movie and I can see how others may loath it. But I think it's mostly because I have a thing for red heads and I fell in love with the female lead character at first sight. Usually I'm much more critical of movies having been blocked on Twitter for badgering bad directors for exploiting genres I love but what can I say I'm a romantic and I dig beautiful red heads as I stated above. Might be a shallow review lacking integrity when it comes to respecting truly good movies but I'm not a critic I'm an electrician and if your reading a review to decide whether or not to watch a movie you must not be a movie person. People who truly love movies watch as many as possible because you never know when you'll find that diamond in the rough which is the nice way of saying your going to sort through lots of bad movies in order to find good movies and sometimes bad movies that have one or two really good scenes. If you've read this far it means that you too are probably an imbalanced person in which case I applaud you commitment and sympathize with your inability to jump ship when it's sinking but those are the qualities that allow you to watch a lot of crappy movies and still be able to hit the play button on the remote in the hope that your vigilant watching will earn you the reward of an awesome scene to add to your repertoire of drunken reenactments. Keep fighting the good fight.,Horns
210,ironmadi315,Engaging but embarrassing,7,5 March 2016,"Okay, I'm not going to lie, I loved this movie. It was incredibly entertaining and I found it hard to look away from the screen. However, from a critical standpoint, it was not exactly well put together. It wasn't really sure what genre it wanted to be, and felt like an awkward mash of romance, horror and crime drama, with often uncomfortable humour sprinkled throughout. The way the story is portrayed in this film is terribly choppy, and while it starts off great with a lot of heart-wrenching moments, it gradually goes downhill into a cluttered, poorly thought-out mess. The flashbacks seem almost tacked-on, and some scenes in the second half of the film are just weird, for lack of a better word. The character development is clumsy, and the ""laws"" that come with Ig's horns are poorly addressed and can easily be misunderstood or missed completely, making the rest of the movie incredibly confusing for viewers who have not read the book. However, I cannot ignore the good, even impressive components of this film, and why I was so generous with my rating even though I'm so critical of it. First of all, Dan's acting is incredible. His American accent is seamless, and he truly is a very talented kid. He really steals the show with his whole act, his look, his voice, everything, even when he's reciting corny or awkward lines. For every awkward line, though, there's a truly powerful or moving one. There are some amazing, deep quotes in this movie that really make you think. Also, some of the shots in this movie are gorgeous. Shot mostly in Vancouver and other parts of BC, it really is gorgeous to look at. So, while some scenes are hard to watch, while the ending may make you cringe, while it's cheesy, predictable, and every bit cliché, it's overall pretty harmless, and definitely a new guilty pleasure of mine.",Horns
211,amandacarleyis,I can't believe this movie doesn't get more love,10,21 July 2015,"I give this movie a 10/10 for many reasons and here is three to keep it simple:The first is the impeccable acting. This entire movie was cast perfectly, and Daniel Radcliffe broke the Harry Potter typecast and gave us a phenomenal performance in Horns. I definitely felt the chemistry between Radcliffe and Temple, both of them were outstanding and sexy.The second is the book-to-screen adaption. Aside from leaving a few key points of Lee's back story out, the film kept the originality and humor that Joe Hill's novel blessed us with. I don't ever go into a book-to-film adaption expecting everything to math perfectly, and this movie did everything right!The third is the cinematography. Such a beautiful and artful film, everything about the way this movie looks is delivered perfectly.If you have not watched this movie or at least read the novel, please take the time to do so. It is such an original story and well worth it! It's disturbing, funny, sad, satisfying and so much more!",Horns
212,bemusedude,A terrible adaptation of a fantastic novel,2,15 October 2015,"The movies first 1/3 is very faithful to the book and I can live with poor casting choices. However what destroys the fantastic story by Joe Hill is the schlock horror and bizarre ending sequence which left a sour taste in my mouth and made me wish I hadn't bothered. Radcliff gives it a go, but the script is all over the place. I can't understand why they didn't follow and develop some sub plots that were in the book, and still managed a 2 hour movie with stuff that wasn't in the book and weakened the original tale. The book is essentially a love story with a twist on how others see and judge themselves and the others around them. The movie is some strange Christian tale of redemption and uber violence which seems to infest the majority of Hollywood movies. Avoid.",Horns

Daniel Radcliffe is definitely an actor to watch - great potential and decent performance (even held a decent American accent). The film has a great concept, looks are everyone's deep, dark secrets, and interesting dynamics with families and friends. It was even executed well. I just think it could've been about 20 minutes shorter, and wrapped up a lot quicker, the excessive violence was unnecessary.",Horns
215,olivia_grace-73536,Good and not so good at the same time,6,17 July 2020,"First, let me say: I'm glad I watched this. I was entertained the whole time, so no regrets. It's an interesting, unique movie centering around a murder mystery and I believe it's worth a watch.But.I have some complaints...(SPOILERS AHEAD)Let's start at the beginning. The main character, Iggy, is soon going to be tried for the murder of his longtime girlfriend, Marrin. Nearly EVERYBODY in town is positive Iggy is guilty, even his lifelong friends, and even his own parents (though they try to hide it). The only people who believe he's innocent are his brother and his friend/lawyer, Lee. (We'll talk about the issues with Lee later.) So with all of that established, I kept waiting to understand why people were so convinced he was guilty. I was expecting the many flashbacks to slowly reveal that he was in some way a ""bad"" person. But no, he appeared to always be nice to everyone. So why is everyone convinced he's a murderer? The movie sort of answers that, but not satisfactorily. He was seen arguing with Marrin the night of her murder. So ok, I get it. That's suspicious, and the boyfriend is always the first suspect. So it makes sense that people who don't really know Iggy, like the media, would assume he's guilty. But that doesn't explain why his childhood friend, the police officer who finds him the morning after the murder, goes in with his mind made up about it. And it certainly doesn't explain why his OWN PARENTS are convinced their son murdered the woman he was aBOUT TO PROPOSE TO!While we're on the subject of Iggy's parents, let's talk about the things they said under the influence of the horns. Did I mention the horns? He grows horns that make people...tell the truth? Sin? Do whatever Iggy wants? Be just as mean as they already were? We don't know. That's never exactly clear, or consistent. But the horrible things Iggy's parents said to him are never resolved. And trust me, they needed to be resolved. You can't just have your mother tell you with a sad smile that she wishes you weren't her son and wants you to leave so she can be happy again, and then carry on like that never happened! He never interacts with his parents again after that. The only reference to them is when he tells his brother he has to be there for their parents. Okay then.Now let's talk about the villain of the story: Lee. Well duh. It's pretty obvious from the start that he's the murderer. He's one of the only people who believes Iggy. Why is he so sure when everybody else thinks he's guilty? Plus he's OVERLY supportive to the point of seeming insincere. But the biggest problem with Lee is that he seems to switch personalities. There's the normal Lee, the only one anyone has ever seen, and there's the ""evil/crazy"" Lee, who shows up when it's convenient for the story. There's nothing showing any indication that Lee always had violent tendencies, or that there was a side of him that was a little off. He's just himself until one day he's not for a few minutes. And, he seems aware of and in control of this ""switch"". The problem with this is that it lacks any logic and it takes you out of the movie. To make this work, there would need to be something in the flashbacks that hint at his violent personality. Saying, ""I like her too,"" is not that.There is so much more in this movie that is not explained or resolved, but I'm done with the complaining. So what did I like about this movie?
There was plenty of dark humor to enjoy.I really felt for Iggy throughout the movie. I was invested.The mystery of who killed Marrin wasn't really a mystery, but the how and why (and then why she dumped Iggy) certainly were.Daniel Radcliffe's American accent is surprisingly good, which was interesting to hear after over a decade of Harry Potter.Um, this guy just grows horns and gets (albeit vague) superpowers. What's not to love?So overall, I'd say don't go in expecting toooo much, and you'll enjoy yourself!",Horns

For the first time in awhile I've watched a movie that at a unique story plot, Daniel Radcliffe was awesome playing an American, it wasn't spot on, but come on!that has to be difficult never doing an American accent before and not to mention he was starting to get typecasted as ""Harry Potter"" so I think this was great for him and his career! Yes it had it's flaws just like most movies, some gaps in the story line, the ended was brilliant!

I didn't know anything about it at all, and only watched it because I wanted to see Daniel Radcliffe in a different role from Harry Potter. I must say I was impressed with His American accent and his acting, but otherwise it was a stinker. The screenwriters obviously have an extremely limited vocabulary, and although I attempted to keep an open mind and give it a chance, I found much of the movie offensive.

The movie is blessed with an amazing cast, however the execution of the story doesn't feel polished at times and it just feels that there are holes in the story that would be understood by reading the novel after watching the movie. As movie advanced to its ending I started to dislike how the story progressed, it all happened so fast and little bit awkward, the fight seemed dull and some things in it just hadn't made sense to me.Horns is above average movie for sure, but with just a little bit more polish to the story and it could've been one of the best movies I ever watched.",Horns

Nothing intresting thourghout the whole thing and everything was easily predictive. The plot was kind of moving but the execution is so bad it cant support it in any way. It also had some nice cinematography but thats the end of that. The movie was unreasonably long and from a point and then it had nothing to offer. Effects were way behind for its release date and the soundtrack was poor. The movie on top of everything represents some of the worst and most cliche stereotypes (the waitress who wants to be famous, girl having an affair with her boyfriend's best friend etc.). It takes one star for its almost average cinematography and one more for the scene where the two annoying cops make out in the car. Fun but still trash.",Horns

Strangely, not everyone can see the horns, yet everyone is compelled to confess their private desires to him. As he realizes the truth-serum power of his horns, he starts to use it to reveal his girlfriend's true killer. Other ensemble players turn from ""normeal citizens"" to insanely honest perpetrators. Davis Morse is passionate as the father of the murdered girl. I appreciate the reveal of the hypocritical, closeted, gay cops who get revealed.",Horns
223,rebelwitacause,"Darkly brilliant, spectacular.",10,12 December 2015,"This literally instantly became my new favorite film upon watching it. I cannot tout enough how unexpectedly incredible it was. I thought it'd be a mildly entertaining fantasy horror comedy with a fun and interesting gimmick to spend an afternoon with, only to be absolutely blown away by this revelation.I will first mention its stark brand of dark humor, which is just overblown enough to be on point. The comedic moments will strike and surprise you. It is hard to even compare with existing movies, but safe to say it is unique and irreverent and complements the movie perfectly.This is hardly the focus of the film, however. Some critics will blanch at the supposed unbalanced tone of the movie. However, for me it simply made it more fun and interesting. It shifts from the aforementioned black comedy to truly and intensely dark and increasingly violent. It eventually had me literally wide-eyed glued to the screen, mouth hanging open. It builds upon itself, getting more and more powerful and frankly awesome as the film nears the ending, which happens to be as immensely satisfying as a movie can get and provides ideal closure. I cannot stress enough that it gets better and better until a truly jaw dropping climax.The mystery element of the film is well done, keeping the audience well enough on their toes, intrigued and excited as the story unfolds. The pacing is spot on- I typically get bored at certain points during movies I watch at home and switch to some other passing entertainment for a bit, but for this movie I actually COULD NOT turn away.The acting was brilliant all around, with complex and believable developed characters. Even the stock ones for comic relief are memorable. None of the characters are wasted, and the villain is just as credible as the protagonist. You will not see a glimpse of Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe, and probably will end up platonically gay for him by the end.I should mention the surprising heavy emotional poignancy of the film. You do feel a sense of true and binding love between the characters and feel entwined in their story. At one point I was shocked to find myself tearing hard after a certain reveal at this supposed horror comedy.You will be shocked, wonderfully entertained, laughing, even crying, and eventually raving about it. Everything about this movie is just shy of perfect, if only for the fact that I would be unwilling to call any film that. It will have you watching all the way through the credits, which even include a captivating art sequence. It will have you downloading the perfectly fitted cool pop culture soundtrack. Alexandre Aja deserves a full standing ovation. If this is your genre even in the slightest- hell, if good movies at all are your interest, do not miss Horns.",Horns

Yes i really enjoyed the demon and devil touch to the movie but there was so much missing. The tension and excitement i felt when he forced his brother to take all those drugs, and when he forced the snakes on the waitress almost lifted me out of the seat. The movie had its charm and thrills, but where did this crazy character lee come from? Why did he suddenly become this psychopath? I really wanted more lore on the part where the protagonist was a demon with the power to expose everyone's darkest desires. I felt excited the whole movie and i felt sad to see the protagonist's love die. This movie was like a chocolate milkshake, but at the top of that milkshake there was some vinegar. My straw pulled and my mouth could almost not handle the taste. I am glad to have seen the movie but it was very close to being to much. I think i will read the book.",Horns
225,mps18,A movie to watch... once,5,31 October 2014,"All right let's agree, not the best movie of this year. Yet, it has some good features. For starters it remind me of the 90's movies with all the bizarre effects, and a little of nonsense at mixture, which is king of great. Some parts should have been probably cut out, it's a little too long, and for a lot of people it will be 2 hours of your life you will never get back... Best point, for certain, and nobody can refute it, if you like the movie or not... It's one of a kind in the 2010' industry. It has a fresh something when compared with all the movies that are getting out, that are, for the most, very good, but lack of originality. Worst part for me... was that the ending was predictable since less than half the movie... And it's a shame because it's not that bad a ending, if you weren't waiting for it to happen. Anyway good acting, original, but predictable. So actually a movie worth watching once.",Horns

The character development was good, and the ending was good for the type of film. Overall not a bad film, although as a book lover, the book was better, but that can't be helped. You can't fit a whole book into one film. Some of the acting was a bit off, but again overall not bad, and it doesn't distract from the main point of the film.",Horns

What absolutely derailed this film was the last 30-40 minutes. It just gets really bad...and at one point I was slapping my hand to my forehead.I compare it to being 3/4th in to a really delicious steak and then someone throws sand in your mouth and makes you swallow. Don't really remember the good part of that meal, now do ya? This only gets a 5/10 from me because it started decent.

It's absurd on the face of it but it does give a platform to ask questions and that's what t's there to do, and it does it well. I felt nostalgic in places watching it and there're definite nods to genres and eras without losing any of it's originality. It's capacity for set plays enable the film to give some memorable scenes throughout and as others have said, it is beautifully shot. Vice and addiction are themes touched on as well as lies and betrayal but somehow is presented in a light that can be enjoyed and laughed at.

And I'm a fan of Danielle Radcliffe, so I couldn't wait to see what this film had in store for its audience. It started off with an interesting mystery, that slowly began to unravel... I was definitely intrigued for the first half hour or so. But suddenly, the film took a bad turn - it went from a dark, comedic mystery to a confusing, gory film with pretty awful special effects. The jokes that made me smirk in the beginning disappeared, and it was replaced with some terrible lines and some attempt to be religious. The religious aspect also intrigued me at first - first we came across a character who wanted to overeat (like the deadly sin, sloth), and then a prideful character (vanity)... and the cops who were lustful... but then it kind of went off the tracks, so I'm not even sure if the seven deadly sins were intentional or if I just tried to make this film deeper than it was. Anyway, the film got pretty bad, Radcliffe's character had such random powers with no explanation and they changed whenever the plot deemed it necessary, and it ended pretty poorly, with a lot of unnecessary gore. Wouldn't watch it again, but I guess it was an interesting ride. 4/10 stars.",Horns

Well, that wasn't the case. It was one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen and trust me, I've seen a lot of them. The graphics were simply terrible and the storyline kept dropping to a mutual 'boring'. Frankly, everyone at the cinema hall was glad that movie finally ended. It was pure torture.

233,meflyntz,Disappointing,4,2 March 2018,"I'm sorry to be that guy, but the book was so much better. I never expect movies to be 100% faithful adaptations of books, because they would usually have to run four hours or more. Choices must be made. Things must be cut. But the cutting seemed particularly painful here. We got almost none of Lee's backstory, which, in the book, helps explain why he turned out the way he did and gives hints about what is to come. We don't see the development of Lee and Ig's friendship, which is essential to understand how Ig feels about Lee. Merrin is basically turned into a sex object here, instead of an interesting and confident young woman. Glenna is such a useless, throwaway character in the movie, it's worth asking why she was even included. The characters, who are all well-fleshed-out in the book, appeared shallow and one-dimensional in this movie. And these cuts came to allow for some bizarre additions. The fight between the reporters? Terry's hallucination sequence? Gratuitous treehouse sex scenes? I'd much rather have had some more character development.Overall, not terrible. Daniel Radcliffe does a pretty decent job as Ig - his American accent is believable, and while he verges on over-acting from time to time, he generally nails the sense of confusion, desperation, and finally acceptance that Ig possesses. If you're intrigued by the premise, though, I'd recommend the book instead. The author, Joe Hill, is Stephen King's son, and shows his father's flair for the creepy.",Horns
234,lukehallow,Mediocre adaptation of a great source material,5,20 March 2015,"When I first read Joe Hill's novel ""Horns"", from which this movie grabs its premise and name, I was struck with how similar his style was to his famous father, being Stephen King. The expectations for that novel were high for me, as Stephen King is the ""king"" of horror literature. And it delivered in many aspects, including the ultimate payoff. But, the film adaptation does not. The direction is lackluster and uninspired, which was partly expected due to the director Alexandre Aja's previous work. The plot, while the same, plays out very oddly and has very amateurish pacing. It jumps between the current day setting and flashbacks to when the main character Ig and his girlfriend Merrin were kids, but there is no real reason for it to be switching around the way it does. There is little to no indication as to why there are flashbacks, and they usually don't even tie into what was happening. For example, there is a flashback seen where a young Ig is going around with his brother and friends blowing things up with cherry bombs, and Ig is then dared to ride a shopping cart down a logging ramp. He almost drowns, but his best friend Lee saves him. This scene, while mildly entertaining, is delivered with no warning and no reason to even be included. It just is cut in there for no particular reason. Beside the odd pacing and direction, the screenplay is pretty sub-par as well. Dialogue flows off of these actors tongues like bitumen crude oil down a slide. These actors read their lines as if they were reading off a teleprompter. And that leads into another qualm with this film, the acting. Daniel Radcliffe in the lead role is actually a fairly redeeming part of this film, as he delivers some actually heartfelt moments throughout. His accent is non-existent, and he plays the troubled young man of Ig to the best of his ability. But, most of the other cast sits under his shadow. Max Minghella as Lee is a drab, uninteresting cardboard cutout who lacks anything redeemable about him. Joe Anderson as Ig's brother, Terry, is almost the same, with just such a boring and cookie-cutter performance. Juno Temple actually matches Daniel Radcliffe in the way that they are pretty much the only people on this entire cast that had any redeemable actions as their parts. Now, in conclusion, this film does has a very interesting and engaging plot. It's merely how it is paced and told that is lackluster. The leads are so far above the rest of the cast that their scenes together feel so much more real and intimate than any scene with the supporting cast. The dialogue, while flimsy and boring, does manage to actually deliver a decent quip every so often. This film is a missed opportunity for Joe Hill's novel, and the end result isn't what anyone would call a stellar film. But, it does have those few glimmers of what would've been, and that is reassuring when watching the movie. Though it is not enough to save the entire thing. Overall, this is a solid 5/10.",Horns
235,xmyheartandhopetofly,Horrible rendition of a pretty awesome book.,4,23 October 2014,"I did read the book, and it really was an interesting and captivating story, i read it in one sitting. This movie lacked all of the symbolism the book had, and didn't explain the most important things explaining how Ig received the horns. Why did Merrin get killed at the supposed tree house, when in the book she was killed at the foundry? And Ig is only seen at the foundry once in this movie when in the book Ig lives there. Also they didn't explain the tree house of the mind, or the little statues, or the matches, and how Ig burned it down. Just everything involving the main point of the book, which is them at the tree-house of the mind, is missing. Everything is missing for me, even little things that i was sure were not going to be taken out...like his conversation with his grandma and pushing her down the hill. The movie is so flat and if I had not of read the book I would be so confused and would of had to read the book synopsis just to figure out some things. Lee is the main antagonist of the book, and he is like none of the movie? The didn't give him any background of him being a sociopath, or his tormenting of his sick mother, and leading up to his sexual obsession with 'pure' Merrin, and ending with his overall actions. I am just ranting on now, but a book turned movie hasn't disappointed me this much in a while. I liked how everything became clear in the book at the ending with everything tying back to the tree-house, but this just ended in confusion and horrible cgi. Don't watch this if you read the book, bottom line.",Horns
236,ahsansaadat,Brilliant start but lost somewhere in the middle,5,25 August 2015,"The movie started off with pure brilliance, although Daniel Radcliffe was struggling with his American accent still he managed to pull it off amazingly. As the movie started it took off perfectly, the wit, the acting and the storyline. However, as the movie progressed things started to dwindle there was less of wit more of pain and suffering with a absolutely predictable revelation of what was going on. Ig, was in love with the Perrin, she loved him back but couldn't marry him. Why? because of reasons. Earlier in the movie they had shown that girl had cancer. And when Lee couldn't see Ig's horns, kaboom, he's the bad guy. Why? because he was the only one wearing cross and couldn't see his horns and where did the cross come from? when he killed Perrin and took off her cross. And boy was I right? LOL.It started so original but failed to conclude in the same manner.",Horns
237,tomjgoulter,Nothing about this movie is any good,1,13 August 2018,"Everyone involved with HORNS seems to hate the movie with a passion and bring a determination to deliver the sloppiest, laziest, can't-give-a-damnedest work possible. If you put it next to the book -- which is quite an amazing book -- it's a galling disappointment. But equally, if you put that text aside and evaluate the movie on its own merits, it's lifeless and limp and held together with strident musical cues and voiceover inserts that seem to have been recorded in a hotel room while Harry Potter was nursing a hangover. Imagine if suckfests like SPAWN hadn't had fun bits, that's HORNS.",Horns
238,danrappitt19,Fantastic,7,15 August 2015,"I loved 'Horns', It isn't yet another recycled movie to keep you entertained while you eat your popcorn, what it is is completely different from anything you've seen before. The film has no specific genre, it's a jumble of ideas. And I like that. The acting is fantastic all round, At the start it was strange hearing Daniel Radcliffe speaking in an American accent but he does it brilliantly and his performance all the way through is just brilliant. There isn't a single character in the film who isn't 100% believable and vital to the story.Visually, the film is also terrific. I could watch the whole thing on mute and still enjoy it hugely.As many people have said before this definitely is not a film for everyone. It's a 'Love it' or 'Hate it' film and I can understand why many people are gathering at the 'Hate it' end of the spectrum, although, in my opinion, those people are wrong. I'd love it if more filmmakers took risks like this instead of playing it safe by recycling previous tired-out ideas.I strongly recommend you give this film a go.",Horns
239,jonodubzz,"great movie, with some intense twists!",10,3 October 2014,"If you want to see Daniel Radcliffe play a role that isn't a wizard, but still be magic..this is it! It was an awesome movie. Kept me Entertained The Entire time. I wish it went for another hour. They don't lose you in special effects, even though there are some crazy moments. I say it's a must see movie of 2014! To think that Stephen kings son wrote the novel, is awesome. Can see that the apple didn't fall to far from the tree. I can't wait to read this book. I hope it's half as good as this movie. I can't wait to see Daniel in future roles, sporting his American accent. He is stepping out of his British roles. To finish, this movie will keep you entertained to the very end.",Horns
240,jassey-vande,Big fan of Daniel,10,2 September 2014,"Horns takes so much time attempting to let you know why you ought to think about these characters and who they are (particularly through the utilization of protracted flashbacks), just to have you despise the lion's share of them before the end of the film. The thinking for their activities is lukewarm, best case scenario, and abandons you with a larger number of inquiries than answers. What likewise meets expectations against Horns is that any type of secret and uniqueness found in the first a large portion of the film is essentially tossed out totally for merciless savagery. Some of it is played for chuckles, while different minutes are played for veritable stuns. In general, Horns is an exceptionally blended pack. The film itself is really untidy and a close tonal debacle. Yet the exhibitions, particularly from Radcliffe and Temple, are all exceptionally well done. However it is an imperfect one that could have effectively been enhanced with better plotting and a stronger second half. Accuse the first book, yet the progressions recommend detach that could have been amended.",Horns
241,shawdybadclapas,A Wonderfully Dark Story,10,3 October 2014,"This is certainly a movie that will be completely ruined of you read ANY spoilers...so Don't!!! Don't let the trailer fool you, Horns is much deeper than advertised. With a wonderful combination of mystery, comedy, horror, and pure romance, Horns definitely has something to offer for all mature audiences. In my opinion, the largest issue with the film is the lack of explanation at some parts. Also, I feel the OST could have been much stronger at times. However, this does not detract from the wholeness of the movie. Horns is by far my favorite movie of 2014 and a must watch. I give Horns a 10/10 because I have never seen anything like it. Horns brings forth a brand new hybrid genre by telling a complex story in a gripping way.",Horns

244,kanalet77,I like it.,7,4 November 2014,"HORNS is a good,not-horror movie.Funny,not bad acted,maybe not keeping you on edge of your seats but definitely keeps you interested until the end.Yes-special effects are not ILM style but the HORNS its not about the effects,its about story-love,sins,revenge and the dark side that we all have.Radcliffe its not Potter anymore,Juno Temple beautiful as never before,touching story and some funny moments.If you liked ODD THOMAS you should see HORNS-both underestimated but good enough to give them a chance.There are not a horror movies but will keep you entertained telling the stories about love with a little mystery and supernatural twists.",Horns

I don't usually post on here, but I was astonished of the lack of good reviews this awesome flick had and I felt compelled to do something about it.Originally just watched it cause I wanted to see if Daniel Radcliff could pull of the American thing with out looking like a trailer park version of Hairy Potter. I must say, he did a great job! I thought it was a great dark comedy with enough substance to keep me entertained the entire two hours. I have recommended it to several people who also loved the movie. Then again, I don't think any of them read the book either.So, my conclusion after reading several of these reviews would be that you probably won't like it if you read / liked the book. However, if you're like me and had no idea the book existed, then give it a go!",Horns
246,susieot,"Once again Daniel Radcliff, the boy who didn't die..",8,8 February 2015,"This is a very twisted movie. More fantasy with gross outs than horror. Personally I really like twisted movies and the acting was contributory to the twisted nature. People who like to take movies seriously really shouldn't watch this one. But if you are looking for a really fun twist on religion and human nature you will like this movie. While it really is a love story and a mystery, it is the sociology commentary I enjoyed the most. This may reveal my jaded view of humanity, I believe that the portrayal of good verses evil in everyone is spot on in this movie. I just wish the ending had been slightly different to be a wrap up instead of a return to start.",Horns
247,goodvibesmakegoodtimes,I made a account just so I could write a review for this!!,10,9 February 2015,Horns has to be one of the most interesting and refreshing movies I've seen in a long time ! the acting was fantastic and the pace of the movie was perfect. Daniel Radcliffe surprised me the most only really knowing him from the Harry Potter series seeing him act as a character such as this was a delightful change I have to say I would rate his acting 10/10! I love the originality of the whole movie and it keeps you on your toes and constantly guessing who really killed Igs girlfriend. I usually lose attention while watching movies but this one kept me watching till the very end. Overall if you are looking for a great movie with a awesome and original plot I would 100 percent recommend this movie.,Horns
248,warjunkied,Half a star,1,23 February 2015,"this movie was absolutely horrible. the ending had no clarification to what happened at all. My best friend just lost the privilege to choose any future movies. Harry Potter was the only good part about this movie, the other characters were weird, everything was really random, the whole entire thing was a big wtf? i give it a half a star just like Chris Rock in the longest yard. Although Harry Potter did a great job faking an American accent, he can do a lot better than this movie. I think the idea was pretty good, but the way it was shown was pretty bad. Only watch this movie, if you want to laugh for two hours straight. i even held in my yellow stream for the two hours, and it wasn't worth it. IMDb wont even let me give it half a star.",Horns
249,dontcryjane,2/10,2,1 May 2015,"If you're a fan of Daniel Radcliffe (or generally good movies) I am almost begging you not to watch the 2013 film, ""Horns"". I gave it an honest, open-minded chance. That being said, I was impressed with Radcliffe's performance, but the movie seemed to lack any focus. It seemed to barely work on one level as a dark comedy, but it doesn't know what it wants to be' whether that be a dark comedy, a crime thriller, or a horror film.That's not necessarily bad, if a movie can juggle all of those elements effectively and with finesse, but this film doesn't quite ""get there"".By the end, I was shaking my head with near disgust at how ridiculous and uncomfortable it had become. The thing that kept bothering me about the movie is that it tries to take the subject of a young girl being raped and murdered in the woods seriously, but in reality doesn't at all. The end result of this cruel and heinous crime is a bunch of ridiculous shenanigans about a man growing horns while local townspeople lose their minds and act like clowns. The mood and the tone of the film becomes downright silly and ridiculous, as well as unsettling and beyond off-putting. If you want to suffer through 120 minutes of awkward gore and cursing, be my guest. I do not, however, blame Daniel in any way. In closing, 2/10. Would not recommend.",Horns
250,akghaith-93480,Way better than I expected,8,19 May 2015,"After reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much but couldn't find anything else on Netflix for the night. To my surprise, however, this was a really good movie with a good cast and a very original storyline. I'm so tired of seeing the same story lines in movies now so to find something unlike anything I've seen before was a real treat. It was both comical and suspenseful. I actually would have given this a 10 out of 10 if it weren't for the part with the snake entering the mans wound in the end (that was so unnecessary and kinda threw it all off) and the awful effects of the gunshot wound. It was kind of strange at first hearing Daniel Radcliffe without his accent but I think he did a great job acting American",Horns
251,qwahchees,Loved it,8,21 June 2015,"The story, plot and darkness of the whole movie was something to be enjoyed. The cinematic of this movie are incredible and Daniel's acting was very convincing. At one point, the movie struck me with the same feelings as what he was feeling. The story is a bit strange, but I always watch strange movies and love stories that have something to do with somebody forsaken, like the main character of this movie. The only downside is that in the middle of the movie, the plot starts to slow down and become a bit repetitive but overall very enjoyable for me.As for the people who didn't enjoy it, it's not a conventional movie, it's definitely different. In short?: Emotional roller-coaster.",Horns
252,ikp-65004,"Fun flick, but shallow compared to book...spoilers",5,20 March 2016,"I know, films cannot reproduce books exactly, but the edits here have taken away many of the more thought provoking themes of the novel. The acting is just fine, Radcliffe is good, and Graham's waitress is hilarious in her darkness, which is from the book. But, the acting is not what changes the fundamental roles and key plot points of the novel, these choices were made by scriptwriters and directors. By changing the time line and watering down the shopping cart ride, characters like Terry and Glenna are bit players without real motivation. They are simply used to keep the plot going. Not so in the novel. Terry and Ig's relationship is much different. Ig is always certain of one thing, Terry loves him and Terry loves Mirren as a sister. The Terry in the novel was never the creep portrayed in the film. He was the brother that was so perfect, Ig never could and never really wanted to try to become. Glenna loved Ig, she never loved herself, but the love she had for Ig was different in the novel. More a friend and born from desperation. The two unforgivable changes are the tree house and Lee. The tree house was more special in the novel because it was magical. It disappeared after Ig found it with Mirren and only reappeared in the end. It was the greater mystery than who killed Mirren. It brought out more themes about religion, good, evil, fate, and real love. The novel's Lee did as well. He was evil from his first moment in the novel. There are so many changes to his story that the character from the film is nothing like the one in the novel. His motivation is slimy lust in the film, but the novel shows him as truly evil and plotting to rape and kill. It just is not the same. All in all, the movie is fun, but it could have been better. It feels the filmmakers have judge their audiences ""too stupid"" or ""too shallow"" to really get into the intricacies of the novel, so they turned it into a weak whodunit. I think audiences would have responded better to the characters and themes because these things from the novel make the horns purposeful, not just an accident.",Horns

I could understand every word he spoke--unlike ""Marian"" who couldn't seem to move her lips, pretty as they were. Otherwise competent cast, but the plot goes off the tracks in the third reel.

About a third of the way through I thought that surely it couldn't get any worse. It does. I'm embarrassed to say I watched it all the way to the end...which is worse than the long, agonizing, horribly acted and written middle of the movie. And that's saying a lot.

The only point I don't like is that they left the ending unresolved. So was that heaven or just a memory? the hell writers X-D. But it is overall a great movie if you are looking for something to watch and have 2 hours on hand. The graphics weren't terrible and the sound track is pretty good with some really good songs. I understand that some people won't like it due to the slow pacing as well as the lack of much action. But I feel that the pacing was enough and there was not much action as it would have ruined the story to use too much. Of course people are allowed their own opinions as I have mine.",Horns
