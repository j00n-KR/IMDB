0,MartinHafer,Crap...but good if you want to laugh at the ineptitude of the film.,1,31 January 2017,"""Superman IV: Quest for Peace"" should have been renamed ""Superman IV: Quest for a Plot"" as the film's script is pure garbage...full of schmaltz, preachiness and so many things that simply are dumb and make little sense. It's also a film that clearly shows the limits of special effects, as even with 1980s technology the film should have looked so much better--especially since it's about the most effects-laden Superman film up to that time.The story is full of saccharine when the entire planet stops to take notice of some little boy who writes to Superman to request that he bring about world peace! Superman, never wanting to disappoint any child, responds by destroying the world's nuclear stockpile. However, Lex Luthor disguises one of the nuclear missiles as just a garden variety nuclear bomb when really it's infused with some Superman DNA. So, when the missile is tossed into the sun, it naturally produces an evil Krytonian who is bent on killing Superman and working for Luthor. Can our incredibly plastic hero destroy this evil menace AND balance two women...one who is beautiful and loves Clark and another who's an idiot who STILL can't understand that Clark and Superman are the same freaking guy!!While the story is saccharine and stupid and the special effects quite bad, the film team do manage to also make the acting terrible- -even by Superman standards. The standout in this department is Jon Cryer-- who really can act. But given the bilge the writers (a room full of baboons, I think), he comes off as simply annoying and hateful. The rest, by the way, aren't much better.So do I recommend this film? Yes and no. No if you want to see a decent film. Yes if you are either using it to torture someone or if you are a glutton for punishment, like me, and occasionally enjoy laughing at Hollywood stars destroying themselves. A little schadenfreude is what's needed to enjoy this picture, that's for sure.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
1,TheLittleSongbird,A lamentable mess and a disgrace of a sequel,1,25 September 2010,"I loved the first two Superman films, the third was okay, but this one was awful. Other than Christopher Reeve's assured lead performance and the rousing score, there is very little I can say that is good about this film. The special effects are incredibly cheesy and dated. The story is hackneyed, unoriginal and pretty predictable. The script is lamentable. The direction is stodgy. The pacing is uneven- there are parts that are rushed and there are parts that drag. The other acting is not even worth mentioning, as much as I love Gene Hackman I just don't buy the possibility he thought this film had a good script. Overall, awful and while not the worst sequel ever made it is a disgrace. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
2,Leofwine_draca,"As bad as the rest, but no worse",4,15 October 2013,"Sadly, the entire Christopher Reeve Superman franchise has dated very badly since first release. I never saw the movies as a kid, so thus have no nostalgic affections for them; I watched them all recently, and was shocked by the naivety of the plotting and inexcusably poor special effects work.I know the first two films are regarded by some as classics, but I find them twee and dated. The third film is indescribably bad, and indeed the nadir of the series; THE QUEST FOR PEACE is thankfully the final of the Superman movies, and the good news is that it's not as bad as the last one. It's still incredibly lame, though, and I have to say that I only found it mildly entertaining because I treated it as a comedy throughout.The first half is dull, saddled with Reeve's grating slapstick as Clark Kent and Margot Kidder's own brand of screechy histrionics as Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is back and slumming it, although he's in it so infrequently that he doesn't fare as badly as the rest of the actors.The second half is where it gets slightly amusing, presenting large scenes of mindless destruction perpetrated by the movie's erstwhile villain, Nuclear Man (possibly the cheesiest, campest villain in film history). Cue the Great Wall of China exploding and a mini disaster scenario involving an erupting volcano. The effects are awful, but it's all quite funny, although nobody in their right mind could describe this as a ""good"" film. Add in some heavy-handed lefty politicising (of the same variety as Seagal's ON DEADLY GROUND) and you have a film that's memorable for all the wrong reasons.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
3,SnoopyStyle,Wrong Idea,1,23 March 2014,"There is a new nuclear arms race underway. Superman is forbidden to interfere with Earth's internal affairs. However a little boy's letter and taunting from the paper's owner David Warfield, Superman decides to make a declaration at the UN to destroy all of the world's nuclear weapons. Lacy Warfield (Mariel Hemingway) is the new woman at the paper who falls for Clark Kent. Meanwhile, nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) helps spring Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) from prison work detail. Using a strand of Superman's hair, Lex Luthor creates Nuclear Man.The movie is pretty boring and even more silly than all the others. There are a lot of problems with the ridiculous nature of this movie. Nephew Lenny is annoyingly silly. The premise of the world politics is stupid. The idea that Superman would reveal his identity and kiss it away just to ease his mind seems wrong. The effects may have actually gotten worst. However the biggest mistake is the idea that Superman would get rid of all the nuclear weapons.During WWII, Superman never really battle the Nazis or the Japanese directly. It was a matter of Superman not be a God like figure to direct and interfere with mankind's wars. If Superman is to act like God, then the reaction from the earth's political and commercial powers have to act more realistically. This movie is too silly and simplistic dealing with world politics. The whole thing is a wrong idea.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
4,classicsoncall,"""Clark's the oldest living Boy Scout, OK?""",5,16 July 2012,"At one point, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) describes his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) as the Dutch Elm Disease of his family tree. Well folks, you know where I'm going with this. Although for my money, this wasn't the worst of the Superman movie franchise. That would have been the third installment with Richard Pryor creating a new low in the annals of sequel history. But that's not to say they didn't try here (for a new low that is). Nuclear Man? Seriously? As outlandish as some of the concepts introduced by the comic books might have been, at least they maintained a semblance of continuity and consistency. Clark Kent would NEVER reveal his secret identity to anyone back in the day, until it came time to marry Lois Lane, but that was later on in 1995 (in the comics). And that business with Luthor cutting a strand of Superman's hair? You know, the hair that could support a thousand pound weight - very poor.For all intents and purposes, the franchise would have been well served to deliver the first two films and call it a day. Even ""Superman Returns"" managed to bother me with it's revisionist history, but at least it scored considerably better with it's story line and special effects. A more fitting send off for this one would have been 'Superman IV - Rest in Peace'.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
5,gavin6942,The End of an Era... for Christopher Reeve,6,20 September 2006,"In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again? What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).There's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?But anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
6,jboothmillard,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,2,21 September 2005,"The first is of course the greatest, the second was good fun, the third was silly, but this fourth and last for the leading actor who years later would have a tragic horse riding accident is the one to speak of the least, from director Sidney J. Furie (The Ipcress File). Basically Clark Kent aka Superman (Christopher Reeve) returns home to Smallville, and to the space capsule that brought him to Earth, and instructed by the voice of his mother Lara (Susannah York) he removes the luminescent green Kryptonian energy module, its power can only be used once, and refusing to sell his farm he returns to Metropolis. At the Daily Planet the newspaper has been taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Razzie nominated Mariel Hemingway) is the new editor, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) is fired, and Clark realises nuclear threat increasing between the United States and the Soviet Union he knows as Superman he must intervene, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) gives him support and advice. At the United Nations a meeting is called by Superman, he promises that he will collect and get rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, he manages to collect them in a gigantic net in space, and with his super strength he hurls it into the sun to explode. Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has been broken out of prison by his slow- witted teenage Lenny (Two and a Half Men's Jon Cryer), and returning to the city he has a plan to steal a strand of Superman's strong hair from a museum and with DNA genetics technology on a missile fire it into the sun and create a develop a new super-human. This plan works, and from the explosion of the weapon flies out Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Hackman), a super-human with all the powers of Superman, as well as electrical solar charges, but he is only active in sunlight, and eventually he fights with his rival. Scratched by Nuclear Man's radioactive claws Superman is infected with radiation sickness, and this is when he is forced the use the Kryptonian energy module to cure himself, and meanwhile the solar charged villain has a crush on Lacy and wants to be introduced, or he will hurt people. Superman manages to trap him in an elevator when the sunlight disappears, but Nuclear Man breaks out again when the light returns, forces the hero into the surface of the moon and kidnaps Lacy, but the superhero returns and the two rivals fight in space, Nuclear Man is defeated when Superman forces an eclipse, deactivating him, and he is destroyed in a nuclear plant core. Perry White returns as chief at the Daily Planet and Warfield is lessened in position, Luthor and his nephew are returned to prison, and Superman knows that nuclear weapons cannot be stopped entirely, but in a speech to the nations he assures them that one day governments will come together and make peace, and he flies away to continue to save people and have other adventures. Also starring Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Damian McLawhorn as Jeremy, William Hootkins as Harry Howler, Jim Broadbent as Jean Pierre Dubois, Stanley Lebor as General Romoff and Robert Beatty as U.S. President. Reeve is alright in his blue tights saving the world and in spectacles being awkward, Hackman looks to be having fun as a bit more pantomime villain, and Pillow is silly with the dubbed voice of Hackman as the anti-superhero in gold and black tights. The story is filled with ridiculous ideas and terrible moral or whatever messages, the acting is lame, the special effects for the flying and fighting sequences, even explosions and city destruction, look like hardly any money went into them, and overall it is clunky, and ultimately killed off the series, thank goodness things have improved somewhat in recent incarnations, a crap and worthless fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Visual Effects. Pretty poor!",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
7,ccthemovieman-1,Not A Very Memorable Ending To The Reeve-Superman Series,6,2 February 2007,"Superman Turns ""Peacenik"" could be another title to this film. Christopher Reeve remarked several times that this was his most ""important"" Superman movie. Being somewhat of a Liberal ""peacenik,"" he was the kind you'd see out with a big ""peace sign"" at rallies against nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his heart.Superman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here, especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain ""Dr. Luthor"" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo the sappy romance with ""Lois Lane"" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good intentions - just wasn't all that memorable. Ask anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor, pretty much ""bombed"" at the box office, at least compared to the others.It did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy exploitation films. ""Superman"" deserved better.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
8,ma-cortes,"Fourth and inferior installment with fun scenes , noisy action , physical comedy and spectacular aerial fights",5,7 August 2021,"Run-of-the mill Superman outing with funny adventures , thrills and predictable comic-strip action . This time the Man of Steele
endeavours to rid the world of nuclear weapons , thereby pitting himself against impressive forces : a groundbreaking Nuclear Power. This ""Superman, the quest for peace"" 1987 by Sidney J Furie boasts a good cast as Christopher Reeve, Sam Wanamaker, John Cryer , Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Marc Pillow. In the best hands, it is dangerous. In the hands of Lex Luthor, it is pure evil. This is Superman's greatest battle. And it is for all of us.An amusing and thrilling follow-up in which Superman : Christopher Reeve falls temporarily in distress when is suddenly attacked by a superpower creation : Nuclear Man . As villainous nuclear-entrepreneur Lex Luthor attempts to defeat Superman via a mighty man . It results in some breathtaking and fun scenes in which Superman battles an incredible force . Along the way Superman romances his former flame Lois Lane : Margot Kidder as main role , and the big guy takes up a new girlfriend : Mariel Hemingway . Considered to be the most silly and the worst of the four Superman/Reeve main entries. As Reeve deserves credit for remaining true to role through four movies . The film is fast-moving, agreeable and amusing, including overwhelming action scenes apart from the expendable romantic interludes when Superman falls again for his old flame, being a charming piece of first-class entertainment , but sometimes downright dull third sequel . Funny and well-intentioned screenplay by Christopher Reeeve himself with a promising satiric start that is uneven developed through the movie, though providing a good sprinkly of sympathetic lines. The film contains thrills, abundant special effects, and noisy action that benefits from a wickest sense of humour and a joyous zing. However , special effects are dime-store quality and it appears that someone may have walked off with parts of the script . Fine cast with Christopher Reeve who is pretty good and excels in his fight against The Nuclear Man . As well as Gene Hackman in his usual role as ironical Lex Luthor , accompanied by his nephew John Cryer who's a true showman playing a crook and roguish boy , at his best. There are enough traditional as well as modern digital effects to satisfy the most avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fans . Along with two main starring : Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman , there are other secondaries delivering attractive interpretations, such as : William Hootkins , Jim Broadbent , Jackie Cooper , Robert Beatty , Marc McClure , Jon Cryer , Sam Wanamaker , Mark Pillow, Don Fellows and many others. Sparkling technicolor cinematography by Ernest Day lends the top-dressing to the proceedings . And, of course, catching soundtrack by Alexander Courage based on the great and prolific composer John Williams, including the classic leitmotif . The picture was regularly directed by Sidney J Furie , giving a lousy approach , only outstanding Reeve's characterization as Superman , but he cannot save this overwrought , overlong and embarrassing sequel .This high-flying series about Superman produced by Alexander, Yla Salkind are as follows : Superman 1978 by Richard Donner with Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marlon Brando, Terence Stamp, Maria Schell, Marc McClure . Superman 2 , 1980, by Richard Lester with Reeve, Kidder, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas . Superman III by Richard Lester with Reeve, Richard Pryor , Annie Ross , Pamela Stephenson , Margot Kidder , Gene Hackman , Annette O'Toole . And in similar style Supergirl 1984 by Jeannot Szwarc with Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
9,sunwarrior13,Too Bad Reeve's Superman Ended This Way,5,24 October 2011,"There were reports that Christopher Reeve no longer intends to reprise his role as Clark Kent and Superman.Apparently,he only did this one more time on the condition that he would also star in a dark film entitled,Street Smart,a movie about a New York journalist lies when his fake story about a pimp describes a real pimp up for murder.Both movies,Superman IV and Street Smart were released the same year - 1987.It looks like that even Superman himself is no longer interested into wearing his cape and suit again.It only shows in this last installment of the film.Superman IV:The Quest For Peace is the fourth film in the Superman film series and the last installment to star Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel.Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor as he creates an evil solar-powered Superman clone called Nuclear Man.In this film,Superman tries to save the world from nuclear destruction at the hands of Lex Luthor. In a speech to the United Nations, Superman declares he will rid the world of all nuclear weapons. Arch-villain Luthor emerges from prison obsessed with killing Superman and creates an adversary known as Nuclear Man. The two engage in a fight to the finish in various landmarks on Earth before taking their battle into outer space. In another development,when Lois Lane invites both Superman and Clark Kent to a double-date dinner, Superman's powers are tested so that both men can be present.Obviously,this is the least interesting of the four Superman movies done by Reeve.If the first two films were a classic and Superman III was entertaining enough for good laughs,the fourth film was definitely horrible.The performances of the cast were simply decent.Christopher Reeve does not look to be in top shape as the Man of Steel and he looks tired as Superman and Clark Kent,who was relegated from a bumbling man to a dork in this film.Aside from that,the other cast like Hackman and Kidder look uninspired in their portrayal as Lex Luthor and Lois Lane respectively.The others gave average performances.As for the story,the movie was definitely predictable from beginning to end. Nuclear Man was simply a horrible villain and the least interesting as compared to the Supervillains,the evil Superman and even Gus Gorman. In summary,the action is boring.The special effects look cheaper.And most of all,nobody appears interested in where the story is going.Sidney J. Furie's direction simply is lackluster.It was in the least interesting among all the films that has been shown including Superman Returns.Personally,I would rank this the worst film behind Superman:The Movie,Superman II,Superman Returns and Superman III.Two words to describe it: Simply Horrible.It was just sad that the late Christopher Reeve wasn't able to make up for this disaster unlike Sylvester Stallone,who made up Rocky V disaster in 1990 with Rocky Balboa in 2006 and the Rambo III disaster in 1988 with Rambo in 2008.I just wished that he got out of this role as the Man Of Steel with a great bang instead of this forgettable film feature.It was too bad that Chris Reeve's Superman has to end this way.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
10,bevo-13678,The best one of the lot,10,30 March 2020,I love this movie especially supermans quest for peace. That was the best bit,Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
11,Boba_Fett1138,The movie takes itself far too serious.,4,20 December 2005,"The whole story and concept are just as ridiculous as the ones for Superman II & III but difference with those movies was that it was obvious that they didn't took themselves too seriously with as a result some entertaining B-movie fun. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" however takes itself far too serious, which makes the ridicules story and concept seem even more ridicules. The movie could had certainly used some more humor and comical situations and characters.The movie had still quite some potential to be honest but the weak directing and storytelling makes this a movie filled with holes and loose ends. Some moments are just completely unbelievable and there are more than a few obvious goofs in the movie and the story.It's surprising to see that Gene Hackman actually agreed to return in this movie after his absence in ""Superman III"". Not even he can give the movie a fun and light feeling. His character is terribly underused in the movie and the real main villain of the movie (Nuclear Man) is only introduced towards the ending of the movie. Nuclear Man is a pretty decent villain but he is simply introduced too late in the movie to leave a lasting impression.Not even Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder seem to feel at ease in this movie. They were both great in the previous 3 Superman movies but they really don't seem to feel comfortable with this movie its script and dialog.The special effects look absolutely horrible and are by far the worst of any of the Superman movies.Yes, the movie does still have some entertainment value and it still has some good superhero elements in the movie but overall it's a movie not really worth watching. The directing and the script are weak and not even the normally fine actors can make the movie fun or believable enough. All that is left now is a silly, horrible mess.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The last remnants of sense disappear in a film of two messages... one more heavy-handed and preachy than the other,1,13 August 2006,"As much as I hate to go with popular consensus, I must admit that it is quite accurate in the case of this film... it blows. It blows with the power of its title character's super-breath. Oh golly me, how it blows. Nuclear Man looks and sounds(apart from the fact that his lines being spoken in Gene Hackman's voice, for no apparent reason) like something out of one of the Conan movies. Superman defies logic and science(yes, I know... but he does it more in this one than in the two preceding it put together), as does the film. And worst is the moralizing. The plot is quite poor. This is most definitely a sequel... and one that shows signs of a series that should have had the plug pulled several films back(right after the first, some would say). The writing displays a general lack of creativity. Luthor is brought back... slightly louder and less charismatic this time. We are introduced to Lenny, portrayed by Jon Cryer. I, for one, did *not* need to see this man playing a teenager. He's much funnier in Hot Shots and on Two and a Half Men. And what was with the complete and utter waste of Jim Broadbent? The man hardly utters a word in this film, and his screen-time is so small, he could have been an extra. I haven't seen much of him, but even from that(BlackAdder and Moulin Rouge), I would gladly sign(or perhaps even start) a petition to legally change his name to Funny Man. The humor takes the leap out of the campiness of the previous effort, but the plunge in writing and directing keeps the audience consistently underwhelmed. The film is hardly dramatic... the action sequences dire and unengaging. The writing scrapes bottom so hard that it goes right through, with no stop in sight. How many different similarly-abled beings is Supes gonna fight before actually facing a villain we *know*(from the comics), other than Luthor? I realize that Lex is his arch-nemesis, but it's as if these writers have gone to extreme measures just to avoid doing what is arguably easy(simply hand-picking a villain already known), but also what the real fans want. How many decades of history does this character have? It shouldn't be difficult to find someone suitable. The writers of the old series of Batman films managed... four times, no less. Granted, they also managed to screw up basically every film but the first, but they did have the assistance of Joel Schumacher, a director without any sense of making a comic book come to life as a film. Back to this failure, sorry, film... the effects are worse than ever before. The budget is quite clearly to blame. The attempts at drama or comedy are usually cringe-worthy... as is the nature and heavy-handed delivery of the two messages. It just winds up sounding incredibly preachy. Yes, we get it... nuclear power is dangerous, newspapers should be about news, not making money. Now stop trying to be morally superior... that, incidentally, is *not* what movies are about. The acting is fine. All in all, this just really doesn't have anything to offer. If you want food for thought on either message, read up on it or watch a documentary about it. If you want to see a good(or even passable) superhero film, look elsewhere. Consult the fan-base for more info on which of the previous films in this series is better, or go with another hero(or check out Singer's vision, and hope that he gets to keep making them as long as he does as good as he has with the first). I recommend this to fans of admittedly bad movies, as that is the only way this has any value at all, and as a lesson in what *not* to do when making a good film, for directors-to-be. 1/10",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
13,view_and_review,Nuclear Fallout,3,3 September 2019,"Much like part four of Star Trek was about saving the whales, part four of Superman also had its PSA: rid the world of nukes. That's what Superman did.I remember when I was a kid in the 80's there were bumper stickers that read: ""You can't hug a child with nuclear arms."" That was state of affairs. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were in a fierce arms race and everyone was nervous. Little did we know that the Cold War was close to being over.Superman decided he'd had enough of the Cold War himself and he made an executive decision to destroy the planet's nukes. As I watched that scenario unfold I couldn't help but think: ""Superman, you may be doing the right thing, but you've just pissed off a lot of people.""Think about it. If Superman were to arbitrarily decide to destroy all of the world's nukes--including America's--he would become public enemy number one. Sure, there would be some third world nations that love him for that being that they were probably already nuke-less, but his place of residence--that being the U.S.A.--would have a fit.They would be powerless to stop him or even to punish him by traditional means, but they would launch an anti-Superman campaign like nothing you've ever seen. Superman would be labeled a terrorist anti-American illegal alien enemy of the state. Kids would kick him and call him names. Adults would sneer, jeer, and boo him. Fox News and other networks would be dedicating multiple shows to castigating Superman. His name would be mud in the States. I think he'd leave.Because as noble of a gesture as it is to eliminate nuclear bombs, you can't just take peoples' bombs. That's like taking their guns. There will be a fight. Yet, surprisingly, Superman took the world's nuclear weapons with little to no resistance.Moving past the social issue I thought this was the worst of the four Supermans. The nemesis (Nuclear Man I think) was weak. Yes, he was powerful but he offered nothing else. Plus, he should have been called Solarman because he absolutely needed the sun's light to operate. He would shutdown instantly with the absence of sunlight. How pathetic is that?Imagine if your solar panels worked like that. The moment the sunset you would be out of power. Nuclear Man couldn't reserve any of that energy? Not even to pass through the shade of a tree?Between Superman's daft move and Nuclear Man being powerless in the dark (which they weren't consistent with), I didn't like this episode at all.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
14,neil-476,Whoops,4,2 November 2009,"I have nothing but good words for this movie - travesty, betrayal, cheapskate pennypinching tripe, these are all good words for it.Despite Reeve's input and his continued dignified commitment to the characters he portrays, this movie is fatally flawed by the lack of production budget, leading to poor effects work (and good effects work is pretty essential to a Superman film) and a lamentable script.This was the first movie I took my son to, when it first came out (he was a big Superman fan already at the age of 4 by reference to the other movies on video) and even he could see that this simply didn't measure up.I'm so glad Cannon went bust, and how I wish they had never got their hands on the Superman franchise: I would rather not have had a fourth Reeve Superman movie than I would have had this one.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
15,Uriah43,Better Than Its Predecessor,6,4 September 2016,"Although he is imprisoned, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) further demonstrates that there is no correction facility that can hold him as he breaks out once again and plots revenge on the man that put him there. To that end, he fiendishly combines Superman's DNA and nuclear fusion to create a superhuman being he calls ""Nuclear Man"" (Mark Pillow). Meanwhile, the newspaper known as the Daily Planet has been bought by a wealthy tabloid publisher named ""David Warfield"" (Sam Wanamaker) who promptly changes the journalistic format of the newspaper to one that specializes in cheap sensationalism. He also replaces the editor ""Perry White"" (Jackie Cooper) with his daughter ""Lacy Warfield"" (Mariel Hemingway) to solidify the new format. Interestingly enough, while ""Lois Lane"" (Margot Kidder) continues to harbor a deep infatuation for ""Superman"" (Christopher Reeve) Lacy develops a romantic interest in ""Clark Kent"" (also played by Christopher Reeve) instead. And this creates a unique problem in itself when Lois and Lacy agree have a double-date with both Superman and Clark Kent. Now, rather than reveal any more let me just state that I am perfectly aware that this particular film has been roundly condemned by a vast majority of critics and even had the dubious distinction of garnering two Golden Raspberry nominations: ""Worst Supporting Actress"" (Mariel Hemingway) and ""Worst Visual Effects"". Additionally, Esquire magazine ranked it at #40 of the worst 50 movies ever made. That's pretty bad. Even so, while I agree that the special effects could have used significant improvement, I disagree with the assessment concerning Mariel Hemingway's performance. For starters, I didn't think her performance was that bad and I certainly don't think it merited a Raspberry Award nomination. If anything, I thought her presence actually helped liven up the picture to a certain degree. Likewise, I also disagree with the overall evaluation of the film by Esquire magazine. Case in point, it was nominated for an International Fantasy Film Award in the category for ""Best Film"" and ranked #4 at the box office upon its release. So there you have it. In any case--and not that it means anything--I personally thought this movie was better than its predecessor. So, for all of the reasons just mentioned, I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
16,AaronCapenBanner,Another Disaster.,2,25 August 2013,"Just as fans argue which is the better film, Part I or II, so fans equally debate which is the worst, Parts III or IV? Well-intentioned but poorly produced and shockingly inept plot about Superman ridding the world of Nuclear missiles, only to be undermined by the return of Lex Luthor, escaped from prison, and then creating nuclear man to once again conquer the world. This plot is so silly, with ridiculous science and visible wires on the actors, that it's a wonder the creators learned nothing from the lessons of Part III, even if it did make money (sigh!). This film flopped badly though, ending the series on a sour note, though again a nice idea at its center.Christopher Reeve still delivers a sincere performance however; shame he didn't get the chance to redeem things with a properly prepared Part V...",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
17,FlashCallahan,See you in twenty.,6,24 February 2013,"Reeve is back because he wanted to make Street Smart. Hackman is back for goodness knows why. Pillow is in his only ever big screen appearance.It's not as bad as you would think, if you watch it in the right context.Luthor steals a strand of Supermans hair, and creates Nuclear Man, a villain with the power of the mullet, and a tan that George Hamilton would be proud of.In order to do this, we have a sub plot involving Nuclear weapons, a take over at the Daily Planet, and Mariel Hemingways eyebrows.If you watch it in context with the other movies, it stinks, it's the definition of a franchise killer, and you can literally see where Cannon cut corners and edited out over an hour of footage.Watch it as a bad film, and you will get a rich insight on just how fun a bad movie can be to watch. Bad effects, used blatantly more than once, sets that are hilariously awful,many a villain so ridiculous, you just can't help but laugh when he gives Reeve that dirty look whenever he gets hit.Plausibility is thrown out of the window, and at the forefront of all this is Reeve, being really sincere as the titular character, and trying to make the film work.He fails, and Hackman just stands around basically thinking Kerching!.It's fun to watch though, despite the lousy narrative, and the most ironic thing about this is one of Supermans last lines 'See you in twenty', almost 20 years after this, we saw Singers bloated 'Superman Returns'.See this, but see it for all the wrong reasons.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
18,Aaron1375,This is just terrible.,1,7 October 2002,"Simply put that is how I describe this one.  None of the Supermans are really great, but they are ok.  This one is just awful...I mean where do I begin.  I might as well start with the budget...It just had to be extremely low.  His flying looked worse in this than in the first one.  Then there is the acting Reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one...here he sucks.  I am guessing it was the director's job that made him tolerable in the first three.  Not that anyone does a good job in this one including Gene Hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have Jon Cryer play his nephew?  Then the scientific errors.  Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight...I think it was a ton, but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters.  Nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently.  And speaking of the villan, did they try to make him as lame as possible or what.  This of course has to do with the plot, a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad...Duh!

19,Wuchakk,The least of the tetralogy due to a slashed budget and the corresponding cheesy F/X,5,11 May 2021,"Superman (Christopher Reeve) destroys all nuclear warheads on Earth for the sake of world peace, but Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has discovered a way to make a nuclear-powered thrall from Supes' DNA and the energy of the Sun. Meanwhile a tycoon & his daughter take over The Daily Planet (Sam Wanamaker & and Mariel Hemingway).""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" (1987) is the weakest of the quadrilogy because the Salkind family sold the franchise to a Grade B production company, Cannon, and so instead of the healthy $39 million budget of ""Superman III"" (1983) it was slashed to $17 million (although it was originally supposed to be $36 million), which is apparent in the low-rent opening credits and the non-special effects throughout.Other than that glaring flaw, the main cast returns and the story is decent, augmented by the kick-axx Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) and the continuation of Clark's relationship with Lois (Margot Kidder).The first two movies are standout sci-fi motion pictures, despite hailing from the late '70s, and the third one has worthy themes if you can adjust to the parody tone and cartoonish presence of Richard Pryor (at least his character has a worthy story arc). This one, by contrast, is disappointing due to the second rate vibe. While there are some entertaining elements, the drop in quality is just too noticeable.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot entirely in England with establishing shots of New York City, The Golden Gate Bridge, The Great Wall of China, etc.GRADE: C.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
20,Mr-Fusion,I'm stubbornly accepting of this and I'm fine with that,6,13 December 2012,"On at least a technical level, we can probably all agree that ""Superman IV"" is an awful movie; just a bargain-basement effort on every front. The science is laughable, the fight scenes ripe for ridicule and there's no hint of the heart or charm of the Donner movies (just their swiped effects, which as it happens, are still the best in this movie). this is the stuff of unintentional comedy legend. As trivia has it, this script came from sincere environmentalist intentions and that the slashed budget was this movie's death sentence. Ehhh, I dunno about that (double the budget, and I still think the script had tanker- sized holes). But here's the thing: I like this movie. It's not well-made by any stretch, but it really boils down to nostalgia; and a powerful drug, that. I was a young'un in 1987, making this the first Superman movie I saw on the big screen. Even with poor execution, it was still Christopher Reeve, and the mere presence of Superman personified is enough to paper over pretty much everything this movie does badly. And just the sight of him donning the cape and putting on a brave face despite certain box office travesty just taps right into the joy of seeing the character come to life before my very eyes at a young age. My wife groans at the mention of this movie, and she's right. But if there's anything to be said for an actor owning his role and convincing children that this isn't really a turkey, it's ""The Quest for Peace"".

22,ShadeGrenade,Superman's pillow fight!,1,5 July 2006,"1983's 'Superman 3' seemed to be the end for the money-spinning franchise based on the long-running D.C. comic. Christopher Reeve said at the London premiere: ""We don't want to flog it to death like they do on television!"". After attempting ( and failing ) to get a 'Supergirl' franchise launched, Alexander and Ilya Salkind sold the 'Superman' rights to the Cannon Group - Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus - the team responsible for tatty, forgettable movies such as Chuck Norris' 'The Delta Force' and Richard Chamberlain's 'King Solomon's Mines'.They lured back Reeve by offering him a bigger role in the new film's production. He promised a return to the epic style of the first movie, directed some second unit work and was responsible for the basic storyline - concerned at the escalating insanity of the Cold War, Superman breaks his vow of non-interference in other cultures by collecting every nuclear missile he can find and hurling it into the sun.In the meantime, The Daily Planet has been bought by David Warfield ( Sam Wanamaker ), a Rupert Murdoch-like figure who wants to drive it down market. His attractive daughter Lacy ( Mariel Hemingway ) has her eyes set on nerdy Clark. The newly-escaped Lex Luthor ( Gene Hackman ) creates a superhero of his own - Nuclear Man ( Mark Pillow ) - using D,N.A, contained in a lock of Superman's hair. N.M. looks like an extra from 'The Robe' and glows with the power of the Sun. With Reeve back in the cape, Hackman and Margot Kidder returning as 'Lois Lane' ( she was barely on screen in the previous film ) despite her earlier threat to quit, the new film looked to be a surefire winner. It was brave to make a film with a strong pacifist message at the time Reagan was in The White House.What went wrong? For one thing, the cheapness of the production is evident in almost every scene. 'Superman' movies should never look cheap. This is no more noticeable than the sequences where Superman destroys the warheads and where Nuclear Man is created - they are the same. Where did Superman find a fishing net big enough to take every warhead on Earth? The fight with Nuclear Man lacks thrills, resembling as it does a bargain basement remake of the scrap with the Kryptonian villains in the second film. Pillow is laughable as N.M., coming across like a Las Vegas male stripper with ideas above his station.The weak script shamelessly recycles ideas such as the 'can you read my mind?' scene from the first film. The lapses of logic are such a three year old year could spot them - how does Lacy survive being in outer space without oxygen? 'Peace' flopped and it would be 2006 before Superman was seen again, by which time Reeve had sadly passed on. The actor later attacked the movie on the B.B.C.'s 'Wogan' show, without referring to the producers by name. A heartbreaking finale to what had started out as a wonderful comic-book series. We can only give thanks that Golan and Globus never got round to making 'Spider-Man'!",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
23,StevePulaski,An insult to fans and a disgrace to the franchise,2,24 July 2013,"Shall I recap Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"" franchise and the roller-coaster ride it was? It began with Superman in 1978, a strong, faithful adaptation of the comic book hero, bright and colorful, fun to watch, exciting in its action, and overall, a serviceable, genuinely entertaining piece of filmmaking. Its sequel was an equally strong film and, thanks to a refreshing but controversial change in directors, welcomed in a more satirical, comedic take on the comic-book character. It was fun and enchanting, if still accentuating the plastic kind-of qualities its predecessor had. By Superman III is when the character started taking a nosedive back to earth. The film lacked the great chemistry that was erected in the first two films, and focused predominately on a lame villain and an uninteresting character ironically played by the very interesting Richard Pryor.And now we have Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, a cinematic disgrace to the character in every regard that could've been prevented if something called source-material-respect was implemented. The production history of Superman IV is heavily noted, with a lot of it being revealed in Reeve's post-paralysis autobiography Still Me. Reeve's participation was made possible by a convincing deal, but even in his heart he knew it wasn't right. The film was made by Canon Films who, at the time, had thirty movies in productions. Superman IV wasn't treated any different than other winners the company had set for release at the time like American Ninja 2: The Confrontation and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. Enormous budget slashing, extreme cutbacks in nearly every film department, and the lack of interest in making a film that would rebound the mediocre response to Superman III all lead to the dismal product that is Superman IV.You can almost see it in the cast's face that they have little enthusiasm for the material they're currently acting in. Even Reeve, whose face gleamed and personality erupted when he did his first big scene in the original film, has seemingly checked out of this franchise. Gene Hackman's return to the franchise, too, feels forced and looks as if he is totally uninteresting with what is happening, and additional talent from Margot Kidder, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, and the lovely, beautiful Mariel Hemingway is all wasted on a third-rate script.The plot involves the ""Daily Planet"" newspaper being bought out by a journalist tycoon who favors sensationalistic titles over real journalism, leading to Clark Kent and Lois Lane's (Margot Kidder) job to be more about catering to the narrow-minded and stretching the truth rather than about honest journalism. Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), the tycoon's daughter, also takes a liking to Clark and his kind ways, as she desperately tries to throw herself onto him at every conceivable opportunity. And if that's not enough, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has returned, this time with his son Lenny (Jon Cryer). They are planning to create ""Nuclear Man,"" a man to battle Superman since they have failed numerous times on their own to destroy him.With a larger budget and maybe a studio that took this material seriously and recognized they needed a colossal rebound after Superman III, these ideas could've worked just as well as in the first two films. But under the stiff, clearly rushed direction of Sidney J. Furie (who already had several films under his belt when this was released, so I'm sure circumstances and time constraints were mostly to blame) and the effortless special effects (again, likely caused by budget constraints), this is an incredibly paltry effort to revitalize a franchise.Not to mention, a trilogy is understandable, but a fourth movie after the third film already seemed that the end was nigh? This seems like an outright joke in itself. Even the subtitle for the film, ""The Quest for Peace,"" leaves a person slightly confused. Wasn't that practically the ultimate goal in the last three films, whether it be peace and silence from Lex Luthor or Ross Webster's exhaustive computer hacking plan? Superman IV: A Quest for Peace is a rather disingenuous ending to a franchise many loved and many adored until lackluster decisions were made in the franchise's latter half. While the series had always maintained sort of this plastic quality I have been talking about, where characters do what is mostly expected of them and there's little deeper, below-the-surface mystery, the first two installments of the series were fun and quite exciting. What it evolved into was something no fan asked for and no fan deserve.I laugh at how one of the opening scenes in the offices of the ""Daily Planet"" show the journalistic tycoon implementing controlling policies and budget cuts to make his vision of the newspaper. Something tells me that's how the production of the film went, with the tycoon being Canon Films and the angry staff the cast.Starring: Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, Margot Kidder, Mariel Hemingway, and Mark Pillow.

24,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I don't know about you, but I think that Nuclear Man and Superman would make a cute couple!",4,14 November 2006,"Wow, I honestly cannot believe how Superman became so famous if these movies were anything to go by, because the forth installment started off very well, but ended up with a ton of mistakes. It wasn't just the story, because the story worked very well, but not to spoil anything, but Lex wants a strand of Superman's hair that supposedly can hold 1000 pounds, he not only just cuts the strand from the museum, you'll see what I mean, but it also snaps in his hand. And that girl Lucy, somehow could breathe in space, not to mention, is it a good idea to hurl nuclear missiles at the sun? Well, Superman is still struggling to keep his identity, which miraculously no one has still caught onto yet, and they even changed how he makes people forget if they've seen the real him. Well, Lucy, the big time Daddy's girl is now the publisher at the newspaper company that Louis and Clark are at. When they receive a letter from a little boy asking Superman to destroy all nuclear missiles to save the world, but Superman has a bigger problem when Lex Luther escapes and makes Nuclear Man, a man who is as equally strong, with one flaw, he needs the sun to keep up.Superman IV isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't made too well, and it didn't seem too well thought out. Christopher Reeve also just seemed tired of doing Superman, it just wasn't his best. But if you are looking to finish the Superman series, then be my guest, but otherwise, I'd recommend to stay away, because it's not that well thought out.4/10",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

27,OllieSuave-007,Fitting end to Reeve's Superman trilogy.,7,23 May 2014,"This is the fourth and final Superman film with Christopher Reeve taking on the role, where he tries to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and battles Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) and his super-powered sidekick, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow).Though the level of excitement and intrigue of this film doesn't match the first two, it is almost on par with the third and is still fun and fast-paced with neat special effects that showcase Superman's powers and great action scenes, something that sorely lacks in Superman Returns.The nuclear weapons plot I thought was clever and unique to a Superman movie. Total disarmament of nuclear weapons may not be feasible in the real world, but Superman's quest for peace among all countries is well-intended in the film. Reeve is great as Superman and Gene Hackman gave us another thrilling performance as super villain Lex Luther. In addition, the fight scenes between Nuclear Man and Superman were awesome - Nuclear Man looked like a force to be reckon with as he possessed the same level of powers and same physique as Superman.Overall, I think this film is a fitting ending to the Christopher Reeve saga.Grade B-",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
28,thesar-2,Superman's Peace of...,1,19 July 2009,"'Superman IV: The Quest for Peace' isn't just the worst of the series. It isn't just the worst superhero movie ever made. It is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made.This mess is simply dreadful, painful to watch and not even bad enough to laugh at; 'IV' is simply criminal. I can't even put a finger on what is the #1 worst aspect of this movie.It blatantly steals scenes from the first 3 chapters, mimicking whole chapters in mere seconds. It has literally some of the worst special effects that make the rubber Godzilla look frightening. (If I saw a very fake-looking Superman fly directly into the screen one more time, after the first 23 shots like this, I was going to vomit.) It has absolutely no sense of logic. Superman's hair can hold a 1000 pound ball, but is easily clipped with pliers. Apparently no one needs a oxygen in space. Superman can simply rebuild the Great Wall of China by merely looking at it, in addition to plugging up a volcano. The law of gravity doesn't apply here – so fly, Lois, fly! Nuclear Man's one weakness (shade) is only used when the plot needs it.The extremely basic plot (as this movie seems to be directed to kids 2 and under) is: Superman decides after reading a ""Dear Superman"" letter to rid the world of nuclear weapons, so Lex jumps on the bandwagon to make a profit while cloning Superman in the form of Nuclear Man.I can say there's one positive to the hell that is 'Superman IV': this could have been even worse – take an extra 30 minutes and watch all the deleted scenes. Your mouth will drop further in disgust. And finally, though an abomination this ""peace"" of crap is, make sure you actually watch it a second time – using the audio commentary.

Margot Kidder and (especially) Mariel Hemingway are also pretty good.

30,ericstevenson,Worst Superman movie,2,6 February 2017,"I just got done watching the best Superman movie and now I have to deal with the worst Superman movie. It's amazing how disillusioned I was while watching this. I'm just glad to be done with all the movies in this series. These were films that got worse with every installment until we finally tanked with the most painful of all. I was surprised at how this movie was only 90 minutes long. It felt more like hours because of how bad it was! Maybe it would have worked better if it actually was longer. Then again, I have seen deleted scenes that are incredibly stupid.Anyway, there are so many of these scenes that are entirely pointless. We get some parts in the beginning that show Clark Kent trying to sell his house. This adds up to nothing and is stupid. Then there's really big subplot where this new woman falls in love with Clark Kent. We later get scenes of him changing personas while getting an interview with Lois Lane. Again, all of this means nothing. It seems like every scene is just taken from the other movies. We see Lois find out his true identity and then he erases her memory. This is lifted directly from ""Superman II"" and has no meaning. We see Lex Luthor communicate directly to Superman in the same way as the first movie.The plot is that Superman is trying to get rid of the world's nuclear weapons, but Lex Luthor creates a villain named Nuclear Man. We literally see him being born as in we actually briefly see this guy as a fetus that turns into a grown man. What? There's another scene where Luthor is with this woman in a dress from the French Revolution. What does any of this mean?! The special effects are downright terrible. They literally had nine years to improve and the blue screen effects are among the worst I've ever seen.The pacing in the film is terrible. So many pointless scenes and then a bunch of dragged out action scenes. Nuclear Man kidnaps a woman and takes her into space even though she can't breathe in space. Were the people working on this even trying? This movie was so awful there wasn't another Superman film released in theaters until 19 years later with ""Superman Returns"". Watching the movie, you can see why the production on these films went through so much trouble. While I didn't like ""Batman Vs.

Plot In A Paragraph: Lex Luthor has escaped prison, and only has one thing on his mind. The end of Superman. Once Superman decides to destroy all the nuclear weapons in the world, Luthor sees any opportunity.I'll get what I don't like out of the way first. The plot, whilst a good idea in principal is a mess, the special effects are cheap and are often reused over and over again. Mark Pillow makes a poor villain. It's no surprise to see his career went nowhere. Clearly Milton Keynes is no substitute for New York (which usually doubles as Metropolis) Everything about it looks very cheap (costumes, set design, special effects)and apparently Lois Lane can now fly unaided and humans can breath in space. Now that's out the way, the movie has something's going for it, Christopher Reeve gives us one last performance as Superman, and is as brilliant as always. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder is given more to do than in the last movie, Jon Cryer is fun as Lenny and the attractive Mariel Hemingway is a welcome addition to the cast too. I really liked her as a love interest for Clark, Jim Broadbent pops up here too, but he is not given as much to do as one would hope. The brilliant John Williams is back composing too!!

34,zkonedog,"Not As Bad As It's Rap...But Not Too Great, Either",5,12 March 2017,"After the abysmal effort from Richard Lester that was Superman III, the fourth film in the franchise rebounded a bit, but still dragged in a few crucial categories.The Good:-The acting is back to the quality of the first two films. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is back to his nefariously hilarious ways, Christopher Reeve (Clark/Superman) is again the stoic, righteous hero he is meant to be, and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) is back in her enthusiastic mode. -Also, the storyline is, in all actuality, probably the closest in form to the old Superman comics than any of the other films. In trying to rid the world of nuclear warfare, Superman takes the type of moral and ethical stand he is known for in his legacy. A very moving politically-charged plot along the lines of Rocky IV and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.The Bad:-The special effects in this film were terrible. The flights, although I didn't notice any stray wires, were not as majestic as the first two films, while it was often much too easy to distinguish the matte background (like in space with no stars!). Plus, instead of really cool effects, the FX crew instead goes hokey, epitomized by Superman's ""visual rebuilding"" of the Great Wall of China that is just plain stupid. -However, the pacing of the film is really what bogs the movie down. Many scenes were cut from the film in post-production, making the plot a bit herky-jerky and confusing. Halfway through the film, the plot is steadily progressing. Then, suddenly, Superman begins his fight with Nuclear Man, which essentially lasts the entire second half of the movie.So, despite a more inspiring plot and much better acting, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is dragged down by cop-out special effects and directorial issues that never really allowed the film to inspire awe or hold the viewers' interest.

For me, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen: history is a jumble of ideas with no logical connection or clear sense, predictable, boring. It begins with an escalation in the nuclear arms race, deftly and promptly resolved by the hero in an absolutely unbelievable way, and then revolves into a rivalry between him and a villain that Lex Luthor creates virtually out of nowhere, since the bombs were destroyed. There are holes almost the size of houses in this silly plot, and the movie really does look like it was made of pieces from various stories sewn together like a patchwork quilt. It's better not to mention the romantic subplot in the film...The cast's performance doesn't help to save it. There is virtually not a single actor or actress who deserves a positive standout. It's not just their fault, but also the hideous script, the undignified material they were given and the atrocious incompetence of director Sidney Furie, who turned out to be so good that it would have been better to make the film without a director at all. Christopher Reeve also deserves a negative note, with a smug, pompous and irritating performance that is an indelible stain on his acting career.Technically, the movie is more than just old... it's archaic, primitive and has aged terribly. The visual and special effects used are so unacceptably far-fetched that they simply shouldn't have been used. They almost turned it into a B-movie. And is it really worth talking about a cinematography without any depth, with bad light and washed-out colors?

36,leplatypus,2 stories squeezed in 1 movie (dad),4,15 October 2017,"For sure, the results is awful as the feat is impossible to get, even for a Superman! In the man of steel comics, you can find brilliant comics about a dark or stupid clone of Superman called Bizzaro! And you can also find other comics about Superman becoming internationally involved (like in the beautiful Peace on Earth in which he wants to eradicate starvation). Here, we have the two stories mixed together with Luthor being the conductor behind but the production just tears everything apart! Luthor is becoming a mere clown assisted by a rock and roll nephew??? There are a lot of scenes that doesn't make sense at all: sure it was the same for S3, but the entire movie was funny and the crazy things make laugh: here it's totally serious and those nonsense just don't fit: humans flying alone and even breathing in space, Supe rebuilding China wall with his eyes ! Clone is seeded by the sun and born as a talking adult with his costume neatly done (even with the chest N for Nuclear Man!) and I could go on: the scratches, the krypton crystal,  The effects are horrible: done 10 years after the first and the effects looks like a poor 50s B-movie: wires everywhere, moon space is a dark curtain (not even flat), same shots used in different parts.

In this installment, Superman/Clark Kent (Reeve) tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons and faces deadly enemy, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) created by Lex Luthor (Hackman) who escapes from prison. Hemingway plays Lacy Warfield, the daughter of a wealthy businessman trying to take over the Daily Planet newspaper. Cryer plays Lex's obnoxious nephew, Lenny who helps rid the Man of Steel. This is one of the most underrated films I've liked since I was a kid. Reeve had a decent story, but Cannon screwed up the film with cheesy effects and too many scenes were cut. It's better than the last film, Kidder has more screen time and I'm glad Hackman returned. I still recommend this.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Nuclear Man has to be the lamest bad guy in a long sad history of comic strip bad guys, to grace the silver screen. And Jon Cryer? Lenny should have been in a cage, not acting in a movie. Mariel Hemingway? I admire her acting talents and truly believe she is a very under-rated and under-appreciated actress, but she belonged less in this movie than Arnold Schwarzenegger at a baby shower. What was she thinking? And what happened to the budget? Where are those effects? Why does Superman fly like he no longer knows how? They couldn't afford another wire for his feet? And speaking of wires, when he lands on the moon, WHY didn't they edit out the wires?! Appalling!And what happened to Clark Kent? He was bumbling, but lovable. Now he's this dork who trips over his own two feet and can't carry on a coherent or half-way intelligent conversation? What happened? This has every aspect of a poorly-made ""B"" movie. How very disappointing.Did they put everything they had into ""Masters of the Universe"" and just say to h3LL with Superman? What? I do not know what anyone who was involved with this was thinking , but everyone should have just taken a breather, found a reality check, and done something else for 8 months instead. Margot Kidder, though still and always a bright beacon in every performance which I have ever had the pleasure to witness, looks drawn and tired; as though she is still in shock at having been drawn into yet another of these movies. And Mark Pillow?! WTF?! Look him up here on IMDb. He's done a grand total of....TWO things!! Nuclear Man in this and an appearance in some obscure TV show. Go figure. Again, with the low budget.The budget for this movie was obviously a paltry sum compared to the other three installments. A cheap and petty thing to do to Reeve. He deserved so much more from the producers of this travesty. And so did the fans.Do yourself a favor and just forget they made this one. Love 1, 3, and yes, even 2, but skip this one. Keep your love of Reeve and Superman intact.Premise In the face of the end of the cold war, America has decided to strive to be ""second to none"" in their stockpiling of nuclear arms. Superman has been enlisted to help save the world from itself, by a young student. Meanwhile, the Daily Planet has been taken over by the tabloid king from H3LL, and Editor Perry White (veteran actor Jackie Cooper) is chomping at the bit to knock the new owner cold.Furthermore, Lacy Warfield (Hemingway), the new owner's daughter, is after Clark, or Superman..or Clark?..or Superman?..so on a double date with Lois, Lacy and Clark and Superman...all have a really tragic time. Confused yet? So were the actors, apparently, as this scene was about the most ludicrous thing I've ever had to witness. This is where Clark Kent becomes an incoherent boob, instead of the lovable absent-minded, mild-mannered man we all admired./PremiseThis production attempts to be political, but it just does not manage to pull it off. The whole lack of budget and lack of quality throughout does not manage to do anything but damage the franchise, in my opinion, and was a bitter disappointment.However, do let me state, that the flaw was not in the writing, but in the direction. The premise was a good one. It could have worked. They just had their minds on ""MotU,"" rather than on Superman, where it belonged. MotU, while it does carry with it some cult following, was a total bomb in the mainstream audience. Not even Billy Barty could save it.I LOVE Margot Kidder's acting. But WHY has she never grown accustomed to those dentures? Or is that some kind of anomaly? Just a question.Additionally, there are a number of irregularities in this film. Did anyone notice the fact that they had it daytime in the US, Italy, and in China at the same time? Or that the capes billow even with no atmosphere on the moon? Or that the whole fight scene on the moon was slow motion to imply 0 gravity, even though gravity would affect neither Superman nor Nuclear Man? Or that the flag pole was irreparably bent when Superman was knocked onto it and yet it's straight as an arrow after the fight? Or that Mark Pillow was about the worst excuse for an actor since Arnold Schwarzenegger in Conan? Or that by moving the moon as he did, Superman would have destroyed Earth and everyone on it? Or that Lacy would not have survived outside our atmosphere with or without Nuclear Man's being conscious? Or that she would have burned up on re-entry, regardless of Superman's having her in his arms? Or that Superman now has the ability to hover in the air, rather than fly? When did that happen? Or that Superman can move fast as a speeding bullet, yet when he's fighting or trying to save someone, he's about as slow as an 80 year old Alzheimer's patient on gin? Wow what a disgrace.This sad attempt rates a 1.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
41,elshikh4,What Woman?!!!,6,23 August 2010,"Let me see, it wasn't horrible. It's better than Richard Pryor's silly routine that was called (Superman III - 1983), being more intense, less ridiculous, and not boring. But the thing is unnatural matters, especially in the third act, interrupted and somewhat ruled.First you must know that before making it, the first 3 movie's producer, Ilya Salkind, sold the Superman franchise to Golan & Globus of Cannon Films. Cannon Films was having many financial disasters back then, involving in something like 30 projects in the same time (!!). So the $36 million dollars budget had been cut down to $17 million, the already shot 134 minutes to 90 minutes, and Superman movie to not super!Although the story was promising, but some naive points were more than noticeable: Superman declares his real character ""again"" to Lois Lane, then flies with her ""again"" over the city, then makes her forget all about it ""AGAIN!"". So what was the point?? How Lex Luthor knew the place of Superman to send him a sonic AND visual message?!, or does he know about the lead's alter-ego?! A human girl who can go into outer space unharmed, with no science fiction to explain how she didn't die out of the lack of Oxygen. Suddenly, all the world's nations, without exception, abandon their entire nuclear warheads (America did?? Now that's a wild science fiction!). Then look at this equation; put together Superman's genetics + Lex Luthor + nuclear missile + the sun = an evil super MAN (????).Side matters bothered too, like how the directing handled the battles artlessly. How Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man acted like a star in low grade Italian gladiator movie (with even the dubbed voice as well!). And how Jon Cryer was wasted.The collapse of Cannon Films was felt in the movie like it was out of it. The special effects went back in time to the old cheap B-movies and the worst, most primitive, TV shows. We can see the wires so visible over Superman's shoulders carrying him on the fake moon. Now the man of steel can rebuilt the Great Wall of China by only his eyes, or rescue some flying victims by just gazing at them?! Saying that these were ""new super powers"" is nothing but ""the stowaway's excuses"". Because they were problems made by the shrunken budget, not ideas made by *creative* writing; which is a claim that pushes me to laugh bitterly!Then the highest infamous matter. (Superman IV: The Quest For Peace - 1987) had what could make it an original example for an incomplete movie that had been boldly released internationally though. At one point, the lead gets real sick, then at another he becomes so healthy?? Nuclear Man sees a photo of Lacey, the new editor-in-chief's daughter, to be madly deeply desperately in love with her?? However, nothing can outmatch what I see as the ultimate random scene ever made; in which Nuclear Man screams in the street, asking the suddenly healthy Superman: ""WHERE IS THE WOMAN?!"", and the latter answers him knowing what woman he was asking about??? No, it's not a flaw from the projector's worker. No, it's not the censor. And No, it's not Superman getting a new superpower of reading minds. It is Cannon Films getting poorer and poorer. Nevertheless, that produced one of the most purely surreal moments in film history!This is the forth in the series. The third best for me after the first 2.

It was only 90 minutes long, making it the shortest live-action Superman film and that it had to rush through its third act.It's a far cry from the heights of the first two films",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
43,drqshadow-reviews,"Hopeless and Inept, Superman IV is One Gigantic Misfire",2,20 April 2016,"It's a little amazing, really, how quickly the original Superman franchise eroded into bad comedy. This being the ground floor of that descent, it bears little similarity to the original film beyond several key casting choices and a spit curl. Christopher Reeve returns as the title character, of course, with Margot Kidder suffering an expanded role and Gene Hackman back from a one-film exile to ham it up once again as a clueless, underwhelming Lex Luthor. Filling the Richard Pryor ""why?!"" role from the previous film is Jon Cryer, better known as Duckie in Pretty in Pink, who plays some sort of pointless, meandering male twist on the Valley Girl stereotype that was rolling through culture at the time. I'm still not entirely sure why he was elbowed into the plot. This isn't aggressively bad like Superman III, it's just hopelessly inept. In fact, the core of the story has a lot of potential: Superman, inspired by a letter from a young boy, destroys the world's nuclear armaments and discovers that some problems can't be solved quite so easily. It sputters and fails right on the launchpad, though, and soon falls back on a muscle-flexing brawl with some generic evil menace to solve the problem. Its grasp on physics, and reality as a whole, is so loose it's almost adorable. I'd pat my four-year-old son on the head and smile if he suggested we move the moon around to keep the sun out of his eyes, but for this film that's a legitimate solution. To say its answers make any sense would be an insult to sense itself. The whole thing plays like an easy answer to a complex problem, from the story to the editing to the acting to the effects work. These older superhero movies don't hold up to the rigors of time as a whole, but Superman IV looks particularly bad in a modern setting. Even the hero's indistinguishable costume seems cut-rate and fake, like they'd forgotten to commission a wardrobe department until the night before production. Head-shakingly pointless and dull, this film only seems to exist to kill time. Which, thankfully, it doesn't demand in great quantities. While the original cut came in at over two hours, some greedy last-minute cuts trimmed it down to a slim ninety minutes. Why the late edits? To ensure a few more showings each day at theaters nationwide. Of course.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
44,MaxBorg89,"No, no, no, no!!!!",4,26 July 2006,"Superman III was a definite step down after the first two excellent S-films, but was still watchable. This movie, however, is a turkey from start to finish. No wonder it killed the franchise for 19 years ('til Bryan Singer came to the rescue), it really sucks, sucks, sucks.There's only one thing I enjoyed, and that's the late, great Christopher Reeve, whose incarnation of the Man of Steel was once again pitch-perfect. Sadly, everything else is a 90-minute disaster: from the dire script (it almost screams: ""Hey, nuclear weapons are a bad thing, you know?"", and it has some awful dialogue, such as ""You know what we can do with Superman's hair?"" ""A flying wig?"") to the far from exciting SFX scenes (the same flying shot is reused at least four (!) times), The Quest for Peace is even worse than Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which at least tried to be decent (Schumacher himself admitted he wanted to make it less ""clownish"" than it turned out).And let's not (?) forget the villains: Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is sidelined in favor of his obnoxious nephew (Richard Pryor, who was the bad guy in Superman III, had a bit more charm), and the ""frightening"" Nuclear Man (voiced, God knows why, by Hackman) is probably the most throwaway movie character I've seen to date.The premise was interesting, but not even Christopher Reeve could completely prevent this movie from crash-landing rather than flying.

There are some cheesy battles in the city and Superman, as a public service announcement storyline, declares he will rid the world of nuclear weapons.

The special effects are the least of this movie's problems though. The script is awful. It's a provocative premise, having Superman deal with a real world threat like nuclear proliferation, but here it's merely a bit of speechifying and a plot device to create our villain.

In the time, when the nuclear war might still happen between the American and the Russians. The world is still never safe and people still lives in fear.

Superman sees in the boy's point of the letter, he decides to talk to the United Nations for peace on earth. But things are slowly changing, when Superman's number one enemy Lux Luthor (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) is having plans to kill Superman once and for all with the help of Luthor's nephew (Jon Cryer) by using a piece of Superman's hair by creating an super-clone named Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). A super-clone so powerful that is radiation charged. Now Superman has to find ways to destroy Nuclear Man before he gets Lux Luthor.Directed by Sidney J. Furie (The Entity, Iron Eagle) made an amusing, intentionally campy if extremely cheap sequel to ""Superman"" films. This fourth movie was produced (sadly) by the king of low-budget pictures of the 1980's Cannon Films. Which Cannon Films were going down, when ""Superman 4"" was produced after they were involved with box office disappointments like ""Lifeforce"", ""Invaders from Mars remake"" and ""Over the Top"". Originally Warner Bros give Cannon Films $40 million to produced the fourth picture but they only used $17 million to make it. They used the rest of the $23 million by producing other movies sadly. Special Visual Effects of this one truly did hurter the movie, there's only a very few F/X sequences were good but not many to make it memorable like the first two films. Also ""Superman 4"" feels choppy at times, not everything is logical in the story. While many scenes hit the cutting room floor before it was release. If the producers or the director kept some of the scenes that make some sense in the story. The premise could have been much more.But on the plus side, what i feel make ""Superman 4"" watchable is the good performances from the cast. Reeve is terrific as always in the title role. Hackman is a joy seeing him playing the villain. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane is also fun as well. I did like the new characters in the film played by Cryer as Luthor's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lucy Warfield. Which Hemingway plays the daughter of a billionaire tycoon who bought The Daily Planet and she also finds herself attractive to Clark character. Pillow isn't bad in his only film as the villain but when he speaks, it is unintentionally funny most of the time.DVD Version from the recent Deluxe Edition. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an decent Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD includes an fascinating commentary by Mark Rosenthal (Star Trek 6:The Undiscovered Country, The Beverly Hillbilles, Stephen King's Sometimes They Come Back). Which the co-screenwriter of the film talks about how Cannon treated the production badly, why the special effects looks so lame comparing to the previous films, character developments and the scenes were deleted from the picture. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes from the work-print (Which some are fascinating) but they don't including some of the deleted footage what Rosenthal mention in the commentary and the original theatrical trailer.""Superman 4:The Quest for Peace"" was a major box office flop in the summer of 1987. But it somehow find life on video and it's great entertainment for the kids. Reeve came up with the premise of this feature along with Rosenthal and Co-Screenwriter Lawerence Konner (The Jewel of the Nile, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, Mercury Rising). Which Reeve wasn't sure if he wanted to do another Superman film if Cannon Films will help produced one of Reeve's personal project called ""Street Smart"". Which that film was notable for Oscar-Nominated Supporting Performance by Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman as the violent pimp. But Reeve at the time, he felt he could make it up for the Superman 3. For his career at that time, it seems to make it much worse. But i think for me anyway, i felt ""Superman 4"" was improvement story-wise from the third film. Also nothing could top the villain Luthor as well, no matter what the screenwriter could come up with. Die Hard fans of the comic-books or the films might be more forgiving with this one.

48,guisreis,Widespread injustice against a nice Superman movie: the quest for acknowledgment,7,18 November 2014,"The way ""Superman IV - The Quest for Peace"" is referred by critics and conventional wisdom is absolutely unfair. It is accused of killing Superman series, quitting Christopher Reeve's portrayals of the man of steel and delaying in two decades a new Superman film. Blame Cannon Films' budget constraints, not all the movie. Off course, ""Superman IV"" has flaws. Due to Cannon Films's bankruptcy, there was not enough money to resume properly an expensive movie like that (budget shrank from US$ 36 million to US$ 17 million). Therefore, special effects are much worse than the ones used in its prequels, and scenes have been filmed without appropriate conditions (scenario, extras etc). To summarize, the film has been released ""unfinished"", as one of the actors, Jon Cryer (yes, Alan from ""Two and a half men""), stated. Besides that, they invented some powers which are not this superhero's traditional ones, such as telekinesis (though, a power General Zod had in ""Superman II"") or creating bricks with the X-ray (indeed, the Great Wall scene is particularly amateur). The super-villain Nuclear Man, although not visually bad, suffered with poor text and bad acting. I also disliked campy Lenny (22 years old Jon Cryer), Lex Luthor's nephew. Though, ""Superman IV"" also has merits, which should be acknowledged. First of all, its plot is interesting and not less sophisticated than most of superhero movies (not to confuse complexity with mess, as many recent superhero films have bad explained stories disguised as story richness). Besides that, there are many nice jokes, enjoyable situations and good dialogues. Once again, Christopher Reeve does an amazing job as Clark Kent and Superman, and Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder also have great performances in their roles of Luthor and Lois Lane. Instead of pure empty action, ""Superman IV"" also brings an important message of peace and criticizes both USA and USSR for their stupid military over-investments. This trait would have also been reinforced if some very nice deleted scenes had been included in final cut (they are available as special features in DVD, together with horrible footage with the first version of Nuclear Man). Besides that, the movie also reminds how the press is responsible for the outcomes of its reports. The final message is a praiseworthy support for political engagement. The bad fame of ""Superman IV"" has been so often sustained that people do not watch this film anymore, letting no chances for its reputation be reconsidered. That is a shame. It is worse than excellent Superman I and II, off course, and, in my opinion, also than ""Superman Returns"", but I consider it much better than campy ""Superman III"" and much truer to our dear character than revisionist Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"".",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
49,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not as bad as people say it is,6,20 January 2020,"When franchise movies get long on the tooth, it become disheartening to see how far it can go with such bad qualities. Among all the films related to the man of steel up until this film, this entry was considered by far the worst in the filmography. The fact that some actually considered Supergirl (1984) to be better than this film spoke to many that something was not right with the direction of the films. However, when revisiting the film, it turns out what people may not like may not make this sequel as terrible as some other films go. Sure, it still doesn't match up to the original or the second film, but it is definitely not unwatchable. Surprisingly, as much as the cast was not getting along, it's very hard to tell that people were not enjoying themselves in the making of this feature.The plot revolving around this feature takes place when the arms race continues to escalate between super powered countries. Feeling a need to do something after a young boy sends him a letter, Superman AKA Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) looks to find a solution. Seeing the opportunity in Superman's involvement, the ever scheming Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) breaks out of prison with the help of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer). Luthor's plan is to create a being just as strong as Superman. Meanwhile the daily planet is being taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), who ends up developing feelings for Clark.The script was written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal who both wrote for The Legend of Billie Jean (1985) and The Jewel of the Nile (1985) prior to this. Seeing that part of the film's production problems came from the budget, it could be said that they both had to work with whatever they could. However, there are parts to the story that don't make any sense in continuity. Such as people breathing in space aside from Superman or Luthor having the know-how of creating another superhuman. There's also meaningless supporting characters such as Lenny and Lacy. Both of them do not contribute anything to the overall story and neither of them have a purpose other than hijinks.If anything, the worst offender is the big baddie, Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. Not only does Pillow give a rather goofy over the top performance, but his weapon of choice is very lame. Fingernails,....that's right fingernails. This not only makes the action between him and Superman laughable but almost embarrassing. Forget all the mediocre special effects the production used,...they could have at least thrown their fists at one another. That's one thing Superman III (1983) got right. Thankfully, most of the other fun characters return like Perry White (Jackie Cooper), Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure), Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and even William Hootkins as an arms dealer.While the effects are not always on par with prior films, at least they feel closer to the first two superman films than that of the third film. Director Sidney J. Furie did his best to keep it that way along with his cinematographer Ernest Day. Furie was the director of Iron Eagle (1986), while Day had worked on Running Scared (1972). All shots are kept steady and have a good number of shots that capture the large scope of the setting. The best component to this feature though was the score composed by Alexander Courage. While not having the same grab as John Williams, Courage uses Williams' theme for Superman to a great extent making it sound almost like Williams was there. Not only is the score fully fleshed out but matches in tone as well to the rest of the films.Saying this is the worst film in the series is a bit hard to say. Superman III (1983) got several things wrong as well. At least here it felt more like the first two. Yes the effects are not as polished and continuity issues are vast, however the music, camerawork and returning actors put in one more performance that still retains the Superman feel.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

I made a quest for peace after seeing this rubbish! The budget had been reduced to practically nil, which is the worst thing that could have been done. To present anything resembling a remotely convincing illusion that a man can fly, there has to be money spent on the special effects and loads of it. The film may have had honourable intentions, this I don't doubt. Sadly, a fairly interesting story was defeated by an exceptionally poor script. It was great to see Gene Hackman return as Lex Luthor (the character belongs to him) and at least he has some more scenes with Christopher Reeve. I don't particularly care for the villain Nuclear Man. He is laughable rather than menacing. The only scene I thought was any good, is the one where Superman returns to his home farm in Smallville. He is in his disguise as Clark Kent as he takes a walk around the house and the barn, alone. He thinks back to the days when he was raised on that farm by Jonathan and Martha Kent. How time has elapsed since then, now that his earth parents are deceased. With no one else around, Superman feels he can be more like his real self and not acting as the clumsy oaf. Then a stranger pulls up at the Kent farm and Superman reverts to his bumbling persona. Bring shot mainly in England, can only mean that the producers were a bit strapped for hard cash.

We learn, in the course of the film, that Nuclear Man has no power at all when the sun doesn't shine on him, so, he obviously doesn't come across as being very intimidating, unless one gets radiation poisoning from him. Or, scratched by his manicured talons.The effects are rock bottom, bottom of the barrel, and they are reused multiple times throughout, which only reiterates their ineptitude. Colour shifts, and changes in tone only make the poor film stock (due to the film's slashed budget) even more obvious. The photography itself is flat, centred, and dull, it never rises above looking like a television commercial.A problem this series had was coming up with worthwhile villains. Lex Luthor, and especially General Zod, were wonderful, worthy opponents in the first two films. In part 3, we had Robert Vaughn and Richard Pryor fumbling about. Here in part 4, we have a reject from a bad hair metal band, with Gene Hackman's dubbed voice, fumbling through poorly choreographed fight scenes with Superman.I give this film a 2/ 10, just for the fact that Christopher Reeve still puts in a good performance, unlike some other actors who, by the fourth go round, would just be phoning it in.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
52,brando647,And the Superman Franchise Suffers an Embarrassing End...,3,4 October 2013,"In THE QUEST FOR PEACE, Superman finds exactly that. Following this box office bomb, the series would go on to rest in embarrassed peace until Bryan Singer would come along with a spiked baseball bat to beat this dead horse back to life in 2006. This movie is bad. Real bad. It's a miracle we still enjoy comic book movies after SUPERMAN IV did everything in its power to scare us away from them. It's hard to believe Tim Burton would come along a mere two years later and amaze movie crowds with BATMAN. Even Richard Lester, the man who pit Superman against Richard Pryor and a ""computer"", would have nothing to do with this movie and the task of directing was turned over to a man named Sidney J. Furie, whose only other directing effort I'm familiar with is that lame soccer movie LADYBUGS with Rodney Dangerfield. SUPERMAN IV is a terrifying blend of poor special effects, hokey messages, and Jon Cryer as the most aggravating 80's stereotype to ever poison the big screen. This all about the nuclear crisis (or as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor would call it""nucular"") facing the world during the Cold War with all the major world superpowers on the brink of nuclear annihilation. A young boy's heartfelt letter convinces Superman to break his vow of non- involvement in the fate of Earth by disposing of all the world's nuclear weapons. Once that's out of the way, we get an hour of Superman doing battle with Lex Luthor's latest scheme: Nuclear Man, a walking atomic weapon with a period-appropriate mullet.There's just so much wrong with this movie. I don't even know where to start. It's just bafflingly stupid. It can't all be bad, thoughright? There's got to be some good stuff here. Let's start with that: Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor and Mariel Hemingway is decently attractive as Clark Kent's new shoehorned-in love interest, Lacy Warfield. Well, now that we've got that out of the wayOne thing that really annoyed me here is the same problem I've had with previous Superman movies. We get one plot for the first portion of the movie (in this case, the first 35 minutes is all about Superman ridding the world of nuclear missiles) and then the movie just decides to shift gears for the rest of the show (battling Nuclear Man). The movie has no real flow whatsoever. The whole nuclear disarmament angle, while relevant to the period in which the movie was released, is just too cheesy to be taken seriously. A wide-eyed youngster is asked how he would solve the world's nuclear threat: ""Well, gee golly, I'd just ask Superman to do it."" If that's not enough cheese for you, we have Jon Cryer (pre-TV fame) as Lex Luthor's nephew Lenny. Luthor has a history of surrounding himself with fools in the movies and Lenny is the most offensively bad of them all. With his bizarre 80's style and his surfer speech, you wish Superman would grab him by the collar, fly him out into space, and leave him on an asteroid somewhere. If that seems harsh, don't worry: you find out near the end of the movie that anyone, not just Superman, can survive the cold, airless, empty vacuum of space. Isn't that right, screenwriters Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal? I've accepted some pretty far-out concepts from the previous Superman movies, but that was only because they were fun movies (well, not so much with SUPERMAN III). This film doesn't get that liberty because it's nowhere near the level of its predecessors.There's just so much stupid about this movie that it'd take more than this comment section to go over it all. Thankfully, it's been covered ad nauseum in countless online reviews that tear this movie to shreds. Despite being released almost ten years after the original film, SUPERMAN IV actually has worse special effects than when it started. They're just horrible. The flying effects are the worst of the series. There's also the matter of the rehashed elements from previous films: Lois and Superman go on yet another ""romantic"" flight over Metropolis (except the background images never quite match the flight movement of the two and it looks terrible) and we get another amnesia kiss to wipe Lois's memory of the event. The audience isn't nearly as lucky. We're left with the memory of Nuclear Man: a creature mutated by Lex Luthor from a strand of Superman's hair, some fabric, one of those magical computers, and the sun. Nuclear Man generates an internal heat at the temperature of the sun without cooking those around him, goes inert when not in direct sunlight, and has radioactive fingernails. Still, I suppose it's better than Richard Pryor's supercomputer in SUPERMAN III. But not by much. The last 45 minutes or so of the movie are Superman and Nuclear Man battling back and forth a bit while Nuclear Man flies around the world creating messes for Superman to clean up with more arbitrarily created superpowers (i.e. his new Super-Rebuild-Walls-from-Scratch-o-Vision). It's all just embarrassing. And that's coming from me, a viewer. I can't imagine having my name forever seared into the end credits and having to admit I helped create it.SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE is a comedy. It doesn't know it, but it is. It's laughably stupid with a plot the barely holds together and enough cheese to feed an entire third world nation. I enjoyed the first two Christopher Reeve movies, and I even found some high points in the much-maligned third film. But this movie has no real redeeming qualities and, worst of all, ended the Christopher Reeve/Superman saga on it's lowest note ever.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Mark Rosenthal (one of the writers) explains in his commentary that the movie all but killed Cannon Films. (Too expensive and ambitious) There were a lot of great ideas they couldn't afford to film. The special effects look ""2D"" and you can see the ""flying"" wires. A shimmering black ""space"" curtain from ""Lost in Space."" Plot exposition would have explained why ""Lacy"" didn't die in space while flying with Nuclear Man: Is there an air bubble surrounding super heroes? A comment like this would have make it more believable as to why she could breathe in space and didn't freeze to death.2nd Plot error: There is no sun (or sunrise) on the dark side of the moon. The villain would not have revived. This short movie would have been ever shorter.Major plot error: No one can cut Superman's hair except Superman, with his own laser-heat vision.If you think the edited movie is bad, just watch the deleted scenes on the DVD. The scenes with Lex Luthor and the prototype before Nuclear Man are just horrible. The film editors saved a very bad movie and made it at least passable. It plays better on the small screen.If you dislike this movie, don't even think of watching ""Supergirl"" which was another waste of a good franchise.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
55,Howlin Wolf,I loved it when I was a kid...,3,19 May 2001,"... but maybe that's because I was too young then to notice that this was less of a movie and more of a PR exercise to chide ""The Arms Race"". That is a valuable point to make, but a successful franchise where the majority of the fanbase are kids IS NOT the place to make it. Older comic book fans were disgusted, and maybe I would be if I were to rewatch the film today. The point is, at six years old you don't tend to question or notice this blatant propaganda. However, even at six I remember thinking that ""Nuclear Man"" had a fantastic presence. I obviously didn't pay much heed to his acting...It is sad that the ""Superman"" franchise makes up the highest profile hits of Christopher Reeve's career. The first couple of movies were great, the last two less than, but I sense he was capable of achieving much more in his field; especially when 'integrity' looked to be one of the lowest creative priorities by the time it came to this outing. Stick any kid under the age of, say, 8, in front of this and they MIGHT be entertained. Unless they're a child prodigy; in which case they'll probably run up something better with the camcorder inside an hour. Don't blame me if your kid is of above average intelligence and hates you for subjecting them to this. Adults? Do I even need to tell you that you should probably steer clear... ?",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
56,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Painfully bad Superman movie (but a great laugh),1,24 June 2021,"Superman IV lives in mythologised infamy as one of cinema's greatest misfires to 'grace' the 1980s: this film was a train wreck of a production that bankrupt the studio producing it (Canon Films), had to cut almost 50 minutes of footage after disastrous test-screenings were a flop for the audience, and the overall feeling that the Superman movies were at their creative peak with the first two films: and by the time Superman IV rolled out in cinemas the franchise was just... dead. It became its own worst joke.Superman IV is the kind of movie you hear Hollywood horror stories about regarding all of the misfires from behind the scenes, the plot holes being plentiful enough to make a fine Swiss-cheese, and the character logic (let alone real world physics) just not adding up in even the most far-removed senses. EVERYTHING is wrong with this movie: everything but Christopher Reeve's Superman who's sadly at the mercy of the filmmakers' horrible writing and clueless direction. Reeve is the only genuine thing in an otherwise ironically great movie to watch and laugh at for all the inadequacies on-screen.Superman IV: the sequel that killed an iconic character's legacy on the big screen for over a decade after its release.

57,pyrocitor,Stuporman,2,19 February 2017,"The late 1980s. Shoulder pads were higher than the hairdos, a movie star was the president, and it was a toss-up between whether nuclear apocalypse, some newfangled disease, or a real-life Star Wars would kill you. Who could possibly save us but Superman? And, in 1987, save us he did - from the monotony of movies obeying outdated notions like physics, logic, or quality. Found 2016's Doctor Strange an insufficiently brain-bending super-flick? Look - up in the sky! Decided Superman could use more half-baked politics? It's a bird, it's a plane! Thought Batman and Robin was an offensively garish fourth instalment to a comic book franchise already on the decline? Well, you're right. But also - it's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace! A film that, defying all expectations, manages to be even more bone-headed than its title! Okay - but to give the film what scraps of credit it's due: its conceit of Superman, following suit from his 1940s WWII self (or perhaps Mark Millar's Red Son...), using his powers to intervene on a global sociopolitical scale by making the executive decision to rid the world of its nuclear weapons, IS interesting. Interesting in that the film could perilously easily teeter into a condescending dogmatic diatribe, or a risible, earnest portrayal of a messianic utopia, with humanity joining hands and singing like the Whos at the end of Dr. Seuss' The Grinch. Amazingly, director Sidney J. Furie achieves the worst of both and still manages to lower the bar, with scores of vacuous, patronizingly chirpy speeches (written in response to, and, hilariously, seemingly by, a 10 year old), and political engagement peaking with a shot of a giant net full of nuclear missiles being slung into the sun, so flamboyantly daft you can practically feel your eyes bleed. Oh, and the UN does cheer once Superman announces he will de-nuke them. Fah Who Forres, Dah Who Dorres. Superman IV's production is far more amusing than ridiculing the final product itself (which is saying something), with legends abound of the film's already threadbare budget being cut nearly in half. Rest assured: every absent penny is painfully present in every frame. If the first half's brain- melting speeches weren't enough, the second half, exclusively relying on cutting-edge special effects (for the 1950s), is enough to sink the nail in the kryptonite coffin. In this surreal, metaphysical Mr. Mxyzptlk world, everything moves in slow motion, all gravity is drunk or on vacation, Lois Lane can breathe in space, and Superman has accrued the formidable power of...time-reversing vision...? The plot isn't as plagued with holes as gaping space/time vacuums (here, Clark Kent changes into Superman literally in front of Lois, and she immediately, inexplicably, forgets, as if disturbingly super-roofied). And poor (but exquisitely named) Mark Pillow, as arch-foe Nuclear Man, looking like he's walked off the set of a Flash Gordon porn parody, spends the film either nonsensically battling Superman by running away, bellowing like a demented buffalo, or scratching at him with nails to make Sex in the City envious. Why does he speak with Gene Hackman's voice? Why not ask how his spandex is born with him when cloned in...the sun. Did I mention he's defeated by the power of the mighty elevator? Hey - at least he can have a sympathetic beer with Spider- Man's Sandman, who was vanquished by a vacuum cleaner. Back in 1963. Naturally, Furie's execution manages to make the film even more impossibly awful than the sum of its parts, with such agonizingly slow, clumsy editing, the film promises a second calling as an interrogation torture device. The single kernel of redemption: even this sort of torpid embarrassment can't help but be elevated by John Williams' incomparably soaring score. Still, he's never employed his talents so sheepishly, with each reprise of the Superman theme feeling more apologetic than triumphant. All this, and Superman pauses, mid-fight scene, to barely refrain from making out with the American flag on the moon? Suddenly the raving ""False God"" animosity he incurs in Zack Snyder's fellow campsterpiece Batman v. Superman makes so much sense. You'd expect an ounce of enjoyment to come from the returning cast, but...no, you wouldn't expect much of anything after all this. Granted, even if his Superman is unbearably smug, Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is as endearingly nebbish as ever. So, just when he threatens to allow an ounce of promise, his oblivious posturing in a romantic triangle subplot with Lois and the even more irritating Mariel Hemingway is enough to knead out any pesky lumps of enjoyment amidst the quagmire of inadequacy (phew!). Margot Kidder's Lois is so astronomically vacant that she, at times, nearly passes as an overly made up mannequin, while Gene Hackman, grins like a Cheshire Cat throughout, looking like he spent his (assuredly mighty) salary on the menagerie of prop giraffes that nonsensically populate Luthor's lair. And yes, that is Jon Cryer from Two and a Half Men as Luthor's cringeworthy, MTV-addled nephew. Duuuuuude. Almost commendable in just how audaciously lazy and terrible it is, Superman: The Quest for Peace proudly takes its place in the annals of 'ill-advised part IVs turned worst films ever made,' alongside Jaws IV, and, yep, Batman and Robin. It's prime mock-watching/drinking game territory, but beware: the film is so insidiously dumb it nearly qualifies as a controlled substance unto itself. It's a shame Superman used up all his energy stopping the train in the film's opening act, or perhaps he could have broken the fourth wall and stopped the train wreck of his own cinematic epitaph. -2/10",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
58,brchthethird,"Far from being the worst of the series, even if it's not particularly ""good""",6,12 June 2015,"Going into SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE, I was totally prepared for this to be an unwatchable mess. To my surprise, this was a Superman film that actually dared to be about something. Yes, the special effects are cheesy and the worst of the series. Yes, Lex Luthor is back as the villain of the week, and Nuclear Man is one of the stupidest villains I've ever seen. But, one thing sets this apart from the other entries in the series: this is a Cannon film, with all that implies. Cannon Films are best known to me as the home of several of Chuck Norris' early titles, and they're known for schlocky, low-budget stinkers that are ""so bad they're good."" While I wouldn't quite put SUPERMAN IV in that category, there are a number of elements that, given a bigger budget, could have made this an awesome film. Even still, it's very watchable and certainly more entertaining than SUPERMAN III.The basic plot has Superman campaigning for worldwide nuclear disarmament. There's also trouble at the Daily Planet as a rich businessman tries to take it over and turn it into a vehicle for sensationalism as opposed to real journalism. However, Lex Luthor is back on the scene and isn't about to let Superman eliminate a lucrative business and creates Nuclear Man to take him on.First, the good, which is actually more than you would think. The story this time is a marked improvement over the silly one in SUPERMAN III. Christopher Reeve has a story credit on SUPERMAN IV, and I have a feeling that he was instrumental in the direction the film took. Addressing nuclear disarmament and war profiteering (to a lesser degree) was/is a timely subject, and particularly so in 1987 when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse. Granted, the bulk of this message is contained in two speeches that come off as straight-faced moralizing, but the fact that they tackled the issue at all is commendable. I also liked how Superman is treated as a more international hero than a purely American icon. Here we get to see Superman rescue people (who aren't Lois) in other countries besides the US. In terms of technical details, despite being a Cannon film the production values aren't too bad. Even the acting is perfectly fine (with one huge exception). In fact, most aspects of the production are acceptable except...The special effects, due to the low budget, are pretty awful. In particular, the flying sequences and fighting in space were very bad. Still, all of this is understandable when you consider who produced this film. What I didn't care for at all was Nuclear Man and Jon Cryer, who plays Lex Luthor's nephew. While he played a fun, quirky character in PRETTY IN PINK, Jon Cryer was absolutely risible here, and his character was annoyingly stupid. He also affects this accent which just adds to how much I hated the character. His presence made me long for Otis and Mrs. Teshmacher. Then there's Lex Luthor's latest creation, Nuclear Man, who his birthed when a missile carrying a strand of Superman's hair explodes in the sun. If that origin wasn't bad enough, his appearance was also ridiculous. Fortunately they had the foresight to dub Gene Hackman's voice over the muscle-bound non-actor who played Nuclear Man. The last thing I'll comment on is the length of the film. Basically, it could have stood to be a little longer and develop the high-minded themes that it dared to address.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how watchable SUPERMAN IV turned out to be. By no means would I consider this a ""good"" movie, but its heart is in the right place. It might have been hampered by a reduced budget, rendering the special effects more dated and cheesy than its predecessors, but the story and themes are an improvement from the overly silly SUPERMAN III. It also has a certain B-movie charm that allows you to overlook the sub-par production values. Bottom line, I'd sooner rewatch SUPERMAN IV than SUPERMAN III, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the first two.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
59,ODDBear,Could have been good,4,16 October 2006,"This is a truly frustrating film. Somewhere in this mess is a good film that isn't allowed to break free, haphazard and lazy direction from a mediocre director and two very lame scriptwriters make sure of that.The idea in itself isn't bad. Superman becomes active in disarming the world of nuclear weapons but his arch nemesis Lex Luthor still holds a grudge against the Man of Steel and devices a plan to get rid of him; by creating a super villain of his own.Reeve shares co-credit story this time around but he's not responsible for the terrible script. There are good things floating around but executed in the poorest manner. And what's more the special effects are terrible, I can't believe they saved money on that front. The film moves along too fast, clocking in at under 90 minutes and some interesting angles are not explored nearly well enough.So what's good here? Well, Reeve of course. He IS Superman and once again delivers a fantastic performance and shows all too well that he's way too good for this film. Margot Kidder is good as well but her role is minimal and Jackie Cooper appears all too briefly. So that leaves Hackman. Of course it's good to see him, he's a very good actor, but one can't help but think he got a big paycheck and simply did what he had to and nothing more. He doesn't look too excited.A wasted opportunity this film. Could have been very good but looks incredibly rushed and made without passion.

60,Beta_Gallinger,"I cannot rate it as lowly as perhaps most people, but Christopher Reeve's final stint as Superman still turned out to be his worst",4,14 January 2011,"The late Christopher Reeve is still widely remembered for his very famous portrayal of Superman, and ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" was the fourth and final film in which he played the comic book character on the silver screen. This movie was released eight years before the actor was sadly paralyzed by a horseback riding accident, after which he lived nine years as a quadriplegic and then died at the age of 52. The final film starring Reeve as the Caped Wonder unfortunately turned out to be a very poorly received one, and knowing that, I obviously didn't have high expectations before I watched it, even though the third film of the four turned out to be better than I thought. While I certainly don't think ""Superman IV"" is quite as bad all around as many others do, I still think it was not a good one for Reeve to finish with.Lex Luthor, Superman's old foe, is now in a prison chain gang, but his nephew, Lenny, helps him escape! The criminal plans to find a way to kill Superman so Earth's hero from Krypton won't be around to stop his evil deeds! He goes to a Metropolis museum with his nephew, where they steal a strand of hair from the Caped Wonder's head which is on display there. The United States and the Soviet Union could soon be engaging in a nuclear war, and Superman decides to prevent this by ridding the planet of all nuclear weapons, gathering up missiles and throwing them to the sun. Meanwhile, Luthor intends to use solar energy and the strand of hair he has acquired to create a very powerful, evil being that can rival Superman. He launches a missile into space with the new genetic compound attached to it, and the Caped Wonder throws this one to the sun as well, not realizing that this will complete Luthor's task! A creature named Nuclear Man then comes to Earth and soon begins to destroy! This fourth installment in the franchise doesn't start out so bad, with Superman saving a Russian astronaut, though this part already shows what the movie's special effects are like, which is one of the things ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" is highly criticized for. As the film progresses, more severe flaws start to show. I saw Jon Cryer in ""Pretty in Pink"" this month, and found that he could be very annoying in that high school dramedy, so I wasn't surprised when I saw that his performance in this film as Lenny was weak. In both films, he tries to be funny, but fails. The way his character here tricks the guards in order to get his uncle out of the chain gang is ridiculous! Another rather weak performance here is from Mariel Hemingway as Lacy Warfield, who has a number of lousy lines, such as, ""All men like me. I'm very, very rich."" This character trying to win over Clark Kent, in such scenes as her lying on a desk in a flirtatious manner as she sees him coming, is another ridiculous aspect of the movie, and sadly, so is Nuclear Man, an unsurprisingly badly crafted villain. If there's supposed to be humour in this film, it also fails, as I kept a straight face throughout. Nuclear Man saying, ""If you will not tell me, I will hurt people,"" is the only part that ALMOST made me smile, and I don't even know if this is supposed to be funny! Another thing, how does the Lacy character, a human mortal, still breathe when she is taken into space?! As a superhero franchise movie, this fourth installment in the ""Superman"" franchise is not as bad as ""Batman & Robin"", but obviously, that's not saying much. Many viewers might say that this final film starring Christopher Reeve as the DC Comics character is horrendous from start to finish, and if so, I disagree with that, as I would certainly be lying if I said I didn't find any tension in the film. I have to admit that I didn't find every single moment and every single cast performance to be poor (I didn't find anything wrong with Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor here, even though this time he had to work with Jon Cryer doing a bad job playing Lenny Luthor), and feel that I could rate the film five out of ten instead of four, even if many would think I'm crazy for that! Still, I would say ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" is a pretty lacklustre effort overall, with some memorably severe flaws. I'm sure it could have turned out a lot better if it had been more focused, and Reeve could have gone out with a bang.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
61,vip_ebriega,Falls flat on the ground.,2,14 February 2007,"My Take: The final nail to the franchise's coffin. The success of the first two Superman films and a few success of the third gave the guys at Cannon Film group and low-budget film producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus a chance to cash in to the craze. Well, they put everything they had, and made it look gimmicky and even spawned stuff from the original. Well, their ""high-flying success"" eventually turns into a disappointment for most fans and moviegoers. Only Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman can possibly save it, maybe even not. The weaker plot and low-budget special-effects totally turn it into a dull sequel. It even ""borrowed"" stuff from the original and even the first sequel, like the romantic flying scene with Lois Lane from the original (instead of flying through dazzling moonlight, they fly over smelly fields of cattle!) If you expect something new in this sequel, don't. It absolutely has none. The plot is preachy, the performances are awful (Though Reeve still has enough strength to save himself) and the special effects are the most especially atrocious.

Also aboard is Jon Cryer, the idiot nephew (Who is an even more obnoxious version of Ned Beatty's character) who ultimately makes this a painful venture. The problem with this lame duck sequel, is that Superman starts getting political. Now I can't speak for everyone but I prefer my superheroes heroic and willing to kick ass and save the world at a moment's notice, I don't want to see them go to congress to lobby against Nukes. What also kills Superman IV is the budget. The low budget kills what little credibility to be found, the villain Nuclear Man is awesome in his colossal stupidity. He certainly brings little menace to Supes and it's ridiculous that the climax involves Superman chucking plastic rocks at him. A low budget and a comic book hero is a deadly combo, the best that can ever happen is guilty pleasure fun. (1989's The Punisher and The Incredible Hulk TV movies) However in most cases they just hinder any enjoyment to be had. Also 1989's Punisher and Hulk movies, never tried to preach politics.

Amid infuriated fans, this film killed the franchise and I can see the reason why.There are two things that try to save the movie but couldn't and it's that the cast from the original two films return along with some new additions (which is a good thing since they got rid of Richard Pryor from Superman III) and the music score from Alexander Courage (with the main theme from John Williams) is rousing.

With this film, he not only proves his abilities but this is, in many respects, his best performance in the role. His speeches during the film are a sign of this and his chemistry with all the other actors helps also. Reeves also does his best to sell the special effects sequences it is a shame he couldn't. Reeves is the films biggest saving grace and it's a shame this would be his last time in the role.Gene Hackman also returns in the role of Lex Luthor and with brings him that character's with, charm, and silent menace. But somehow he seems to be out of place most of the time and serves as a drawback in many of his scenes. Mark McClure, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder all return in their roles. But unfortunately they are all under used and their appearances might as well be cameos.The rest of the cast does a decent job. Mark Pillow does excellent in the role of Nuclear Man, Luthor's super powered creation. Pillow does the role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been in the special effects had been better. Mariel Hemingway is a welcomed addition to the cast as a heiress who serves as an additional love interest for Clark Kent. The only major addition that doesn't fit is Jon Cryer who could easily be the single most annoying character to ever appear in a Superman movie.The film's real drawback is its low budget values. While this doesn't affect the majority of sets, the Fortress of Solitude set in particular looks cheap when compared to the one found in previous films. The same can also be said of the Daily Planet set. The low budget would also hurt the film in the area a budget was needed most: special effects.The previous films, for all their flaws, at least had decent special effects and mostly convincing flying sequences and this film has neither. The special effects are sub-par by virtually any standard and despite being made nearly a decade after the first movie the effects from the first movie are still more convincing. The truly horrific nature of this films effect sequences can be seen during the climactic battles between Superman and Nuclear Man. The added addition of new powers with bad special effects doesn't help either.The other major problem is the pacing of the film. The first 50 minutes or so is sheer entertainment that's the set up the story of both Superman riding the world of nukes and Luthor's evil plan. The set up, however, is better then the execution of the ending, which is both rushed and disjointed. The subplots of Mariel Hemingway's character and the boy who inspired Superman's quest are both left unfinished for example. Whole scenes feel incomplete and the final battle is over far too quickly to be effective.But the film does have a saving grace in its concept. The idea of taking Superman, the ultimate hero of America, and placing him into the timely situation of Cold War disarmament is a stroke of utter brilliance. The concept of Luthor and Nuclear Man added to it also serve as an interesting addition to the story and it makes for good entertainment when viewed in this context. But this concept is ruined by the rushed feeling of the ending. But one still has to give high marks to Christopher Reeves and the screenwriters for their concept.The films does have another saving grace: its musical score. Like the Ken Thorne scores for II and III, Alexander Courage's score makes heavy use of the John Williams themes composed for the first film and is highly effective. The Courage adaptation never fails to use the Williams music to maximum effect and it's a shame that, at Courage's own request, it has yet to see release.Despite its flaws in special effects and editing, Superman IV has saving graces in Christopher Reeves, the rest of the cast, the music, and the timely nature of the story. While nowhere near as good as Superman The Movie or Superman II and while not as bad as Superman III, the film still serves its purpose and is your average Superman adventure.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
70,griffolyon12,Even Superman couldn't save this one!,1,14 May 2006,"I am a huge Superman fan and I loved the first two Superman films,but starting with the third one this franchise slowly started going down.Now we reach the fourth installment in the franchise and not even Superman himself could of saved this one.The story and villain were weak and the action was boring.Plus this sported the worst special effects in the franchise.This film feels rushed and choppy,cutting from scene to scene leaving you confused.Christopher Reeves still played the part perfectly,but him and Margot Kidder are the only ones.I felt throughout the film they tried to rekindle the success of the original two,but just couldn't do it.With a corny script,bad special effects and action,weak acting,and terrible directing and editing this one is completely passable.You definitely will not be watching this one again and again like the first two.A disappointing: 1/10!!!",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
71,Min111,I like the fourth movie,5,3 May 2020,"I'm actually one of the very few that likes Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. I thought it was a good movie. In this movie, Superman has another great challenge, and to save the world yet again. So, I can't understand how you can not like this fourth movie because it's different compared to the previous three movies - the story is different that is. At least this Superman movie, tries to be different, and that's where I think ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" succeeded, otherwise it would've been flat and boring. People are forgetting that this movie still has 'Lex Luthor' who happens to be Superman's greatest enemy. I don't know what else this movie could've done just so you can like it. Basically, the battle still resumes between these two 'popular' characters just like what you saw in the first movie. It's like a continuation from the first movie: Superman. I like this movie, and it's a Superman movie I could watch again. It's an eighties movie by the way, and I like movies from the eighties. I like the title for this movie, and think it's a wonderful title to call it. I think all the Superman movies are fine and successful movies. Usually, the third and fourth movies tend to get a lot of criticism, and this Superman movie was no different. I think that's unfair because Superman IV is a true superhero movie. It's rare to see a good fourth movie, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was one of them. Just be sure to add it to your watchlist!",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
72,dr_foreman,Worth a few laughs,5,4 January 2007,"I recently watched ""Superman IV"" for the first time since...well, 1987, I guess. How time flies.I thought the first half-hour was actually pretty good - not luminous, but fine. The hostile takeover of the Daily Planet is interesting, and I enjoyed Superman's moral dilemma about the nuclear missile situation (some reviews suggest that Superman is all gung-ho about disarming the world; in fact, he's initially quite reluctant to do so).But after that decent first half hour, the movie pretty much falls apart. The Daily Planet storyline is resolved abruptly and unconvincingly - I simply can't accept that Muriel Hemingway's character undergoes a total conversion from yellow journalist to an editor with integrity. What exactly inspires this change of heart, besides the fact that she's hot for stumbling, stupid Clark Kent? The nuclear missile plot is also glossed over. I'm not exactly sure why Superman decides to abandon his disarmament mission; just because Lex Luthor's given him some trouble, suddenly he's not in favor of world peace? The movie simply doesn't explore his decision-making processes thoroughly enough.Another strangely underdeveloped plot line is the sale of the Kent farm. In an early scene, we find out that a ""big developer"" is interested in buying the farm, but Clark would prefer to sell it to a small-time farmer. This is actually a pretty nice segment, pleasingly reminiscent of the first film, but it comes to absolutely nothing, as the sale of the farm is never mentioned again. Huh? Some of these plotting problems doubtless arise from the fact that about 40 minutes were chopped out of the film before its release. However, I've heard that a lot of the missing footage is devoted to action, so it probably plugs relatively few of the aforementioned plot gaps. Anyway, what really matters is that the theatrical release is semi-incomprehensible.The special effects are another big minus for the film. For example, the same terrible ""green screen"" shot of Superman flying toward the audience is reused about eight times, and it's so bad that you didn't even want to see it once. I know this film had a limited $17 million budget, but for goodness' sake, I've seen better special effects done on much smaller TV budgets.And yet...and yet...I can't bring myself to hate this movie. At a mere 90 minutes, it's much pacier (and more sincere) than the plodding, dreadful ""Superman III."" Also, it's nice to see Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman back in substantial roles after they were basically ignored in the previous film. Hackman's performance as Lex Luthor is always pretty funny, even if he's playing it on auto-pilot; I particularly enjoy the moment when he lights his cigar using Nuclear Man's radioactive aura.I don't even object to the presence of Mariel Hemingway, who is strangely sexy in this movie - though somehow I feel obliged to point out that an actress with a one-scene cameo as a teacher is actually the prettiest woman in the whole thing.Even the much-maligned special effects have a certain campy charm. And, you know, Nuclear Man is cool in certain dumb ways; he gives Superman a tough fight, which makes him at least somewhat interesting. He looks ridiculous, of course, but I don't really sweat his mullet as much as everyone else does. (When are we going to get over this whole childish mullet obsession, anyway?) Despite this praise, I should note that, toward the ending of the movie, Nuclear Man flies into space carrying Hemingway...and she survives, despite the fact that she's not wearing a space suit. That complete lack of realism, attention to detail, whatever you want to call it - I guess that's typical of the whole movie. But I still get a laugh out of it.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
73,Jithindurden,Nothing interesting,3,12 August 2018,"Not as bad as the worst parts of the 3rd film but not as good as its best part either. It's just plainly bad, uninteresting and boring and the actors seem to know that too. Continuity or anything related to that is abandoned yet its silliness and sweetness doesn't make you hate it, just forget about it.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
74,raypdaley182,Very bad,2,17 September 2006,"Isn't the entire basis of this film utter rubbish? The Ace Nuclear Treaty had already been signed in reality by Reagan & Gorbechov so the nuclear arms race was slowing down, not speeding up.The start is pretty dire. Again Lex Luthor has hair and how his nephew got anywhere near the quarry full of prisoners isn't addressed at all. That place would be crawling with armed guards. And the 2 cops in the car should have been killed in the blast as well.For someone so hot on law and order, Clark Kent certainly jaywalks a lot doesn't he? In both this and Superman II, he crosses the street illegally.And since when did London Underground trains start running in America? And Lois still hasn't learned her lesson? Superman never notices her unless he's rescuing her. She needs to stop trying to attract his attention at rescues. Makes you think she gets into trouble on purpose.Since when have newspapers been in the market of making money? They report the news.Superman's hair is only any good for DNA if it had a root, which they most likely didn't know back then. Oh, and if it can hold a 1000 pound weight, why can't it stand a pair of bolt-cutters? Funny how by this movie Lois seems to remember everything that he made her forget with the kiss in Superman II, so he has to make her forget with that kiss again. What is on his lips that does that? Jeremy with Superman was obviously filmed in New York, you could see the NYPD mounted officer and the square they were stood in was obviously near the World Trade Centre - The then HQ of the UN.The mistake of labeling a delegate ENGLAND, (We would be labeled United Kingdom, NOT England - that would be an insult to the Welsh, The Scottish, The Irish and The Manx).The missiles that the submarines fire would be useless to Superman in his attempt to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Test fires are never armed and normally don't carry warheads either.Does Superman know what damage he would do to the Solar System by throwing all those nuclear weapons into the sun? All that extra radiation that would be showered down onto the Earth. IDIOT! Jim Broadbent playing a Russian is very amusing. As well as the other arms dealer with the mustache who is very English, he appeared in Ever Decreasing Circles as Richard Briars' neighbor.The Sgt. York joke (when Lex is planting the device on the missile) is so quick it's missed by most people watching. No-one asked Luthor or any of his party for ID (highly unlikely in an area launching nuclear missiles. He'd be asked for ID then shot on sight for not having any, the military don't screw around with live nuclear weapons).How is it that Nuclear Man is a fully grown adult? And how did he learn to speak? Or fly? Plus he seems to know what his mission is ""Destroy Superman now!"", without anyone having told him that vital information.Lois says to Lacey in THAT dress that ""Clark's not going to notice, no matter what you wear"". Clark isn't gay, he's got eyes. And Lois had already described her as ""illegal"". Jealous, Lois? Why Clark didn't change into Superman in the hotel's revolving doors instead of getting in the back of a car (Superman breaks into cars, yet more lawlessness by Clark Kent) I don't know.Oh, and how did Clark ring the door bell when Superman was still inside the room? If Nuclear Man is a clone from Superman's DNA, why doesn't he look like Superman? I don't see how Superman can stop a Volcano by plugging it up. Pressure builds up and the plug would just be ejected, it'd be a matter of time. Why not just do freezing breath inside the Volcano to cool it. Still plugging it but in a more natural way how real Volcano's become dormant.Why is The Statue Of Liberty in Metropolis? Just another sign this was filmed in New York. Oh, and I don't care how strong Nuclear Man is supposed to be or how sharp his nails are but he wouldn't cut Superman's skin.This attempt to show Superman with a human side had already been done in Superman II when he gave up his powers to live with Lois and got beaten up in the diner by the trucker. Try and come up with some new ideas? I like the very bad cut when Lex was holding the money that Nuclear Man set fire to then they cut and his hand was by his side, no longer up by his face. And we're always told glowing green crystals are Kryptonite but the one at the farm seems to help the very sick looking Clark? The fight in Metropolis between Superman and Nuclear Man is basically a rip-off of the fight between him, Zod, Non & Ursa in Superman II. He even uses that ""don't do it, the people"" line that he said back then.Exactly WHICH woman does Nuclear Man want? He's never met Stacey or Lois so exactly who did he mean? He knows nothing about either woman or what possible use they could be to him as hostages.They even copy fighting on The Moon which had also already been done in Superman II, basically this film recycled a lot of ideas from Superman II. As well as the ideas of a bad self and the duality ideas used creating an ""Evil Superman"" in the original motion picture.Can anyone tell me why Nuclear Man roars exactly like old style Godzilla from the Japanese films? For such a tough villain, Nuclear Man is defeated FAR too easily in my eyes. The film just ran out of ideas I guess.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
75,TheMan3051,Superman IV: The Quest for a better movie (1987),7,5 July 2002,"What the F-Word was this? This movie had some entertaining moments but that was like only 5% of the movie. I think this is the 2nd worst movie in the series but I'm not sure. I only saw the first hour of Superman III (I found it boring) so I don't know if it's the worst or 2nd worst. Anyway, this movie was so cheesy and barely faithful to the comics.Nuclear Man?!?! What the F-word was that? The filmmakers of this movie were complete idiots! If they had a low budget then why didn't they just have the movie be about the romance between Lois and Clark? They could have also done the action sequences TV style because I doubt a Superman show will cost more then a million dollars to make. What ruined this movie wasn't a bad script or a low budget but bad financial decisions. The filmmakers didn't use the $17 million wisely. What makes a good movie isn't the special effects. It's the story and the characters behind it. If I would have been 16 years older in 1986/7 I could have taken those $17 million and made a great movie!   *1/2 out of **** Stars",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
76,richieandsam,Such a shame!,5,16 May 2013,"SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACEOK... so everyone knows that this is the worst Superman movie ever made... but if you have not seen it in a while, you should watch it.It is still pretty rubbish, but it is not as bad as I remember.The story is not that bad... Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.The movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... ""The less said about Superman IV the better.""Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.The effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.There are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!When I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.I will give this film 5 out of 10.It's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career.

77,Al_The_Strange,"""Is the world gonna be vaporized?""",4,13 June 2013,"Superman: The Movie and Superman II were decent (if not a little dated and cheesy) adaptations of the classic comic-book hero. Then, Superman III came along, with so much absurdity and camp; I didn't think it could get any sillier or dumber than that. Then I saw Superman IV.Suffering from massive budget cuts, this film was cut down to a short, cheap, silly affair. Given the story, I doubt this movie would have been that much better with a bigger budget anyway. The film starts off with a few pointless character-building points and bits of Daily Planet drama (a subplot that ultimately could have been cut out completely without sacrificing much). For the last half or so, however, the film's real meat is in a long, epic, and rather silly clash between Superman and Nuclear Man. Oh, it's pretty cool to see a guy with claws shooting red lightning bolts everywhere, but all the encounters between this villain and the hero are made pretty short and stupidly. Among the absurdities in the film, one of the most defining testaments to this film's weaknesses has to be the scene where Superman rebuilds the Great Wall of China simply by staring at it.The best that can be said is that the film skirts along the ""so bad it's good"" threshold. It's not terribly boring or dull, just poorly executed. It is to Superman what Batman and Robin is to Batman (although I always found B&R a little more endearing).The plot for Superman IV gets a little pushy (and rather one-sided) with its themes of nuclear disarmament. It is ultimately a weak plot, with barely any characterization involved. As daft as most scenes are, it all comes off as shallow and forgettable.This film has its share of okay photography and editing. Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and Jackie Cooper all reprise their roles admirably; Mark Pillow is deliciously over-the-top as the villain. Writing is not terribly great. This production has a rather weak array of sets, props, and costumes. Special effects vary from scene to scene; some look cool, others look terrible. The music score continues to repeat the themes already established by John Williams.Fun, maybe, but definitely the weakest and silliest film in the Superman franchise. Unless you're looking for something to make fun of, you best avoid.2/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Awful | Film: Poor)",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
78,domino1003,Should Have Been Bombed Instead,1,10 October 2003,"Sorry excuse for Christopher Reeves' last time as The Man Of Steel. Superman decides to help with the nuclear crisis by getting rid of the bombs, but Lex Luther has other ideas, and uses the bombs to create Nuclear Man. There's also a subplot where The Daily Planet is taken over by a tabloid. The new owner's daughter (Mariel Hemingway)has the hots for Clark Kent (WHY?). Margot Kidder looks tired as Lois Lane and the SFX are crappy. Even some of the situations are borrowed from previous films (Superman pleads with Nuclear Man to stop because ""The People"" will be harmed, just like in Superman 2). The acting is laughable and the plots are just as bad. Rent the first 2 instead and leave it at that.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
79,rdoyle29,A terrible film ... but really ... the whole series is terrible ...,3,21 July 2017,"Generally speaking, I have no fondness for this series of films. I think Reeves is okay as Superman (a character I have no fondness for), but the humour that permeates this series is asinine and childish. So while I would admit that this film is astonishingly shoddy and stupid compared to the previous entries (or at least the first two films), I can't say that I like it any less than any of the other films. In fact, I probably enjoyed it a bit more, but that's not really to the film's credit. A lot can be made of the fact that this film's budget was cut by about 2/3 due to Cannon's financial difficulties, but although that really shows in the film's insanely shoddy effects work and poor subbing of London for New York City, you can't really argue that this would be a good film if the effects were better. This is a film where Superman seems surprised that an elevator won't hold someone with strength similar to his. This is a film where Superman pushes the moon out of orbit with no repercussions. To be fair, it's also a film where the comedic elements are just as idiotic if not worse that the previous films. I grant all that ... but somehow the fact that this film is clearly junk makes it's stupidity less egregious than the stupidity of the earlier big budget studio films.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

81,theshadow908,Just...Just awful. I mean...Just awful.,1,2 July 2006,"Superman IV tells the story of a little boy begging to Superman to rid the world of Nuclear missiles. Superman is reluctant at first, but then agrees to do it. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has returned and he has created a new villain for Superman to fight...Nuclear Man. Superman IV has a weak plot, weak acting, and is a very anti-climatic ending to the Superman series.Everything that the first movie did right is done wrong. The action is very trite, and not exciting to watch at all. The romantic subplot...There is none. Lois Lane has shrunk to a nothing character, while a new pointless love interest played by veteran TV movie actress Merial Hemingway tries to steal Superman's heart. Even the return of Lex Luthor couldn't save this movie. He becomes a secondary, pointless character, with none of the wit he had before. The special effects are actually worse than the first film, which makes this movie laughable. The Nuclear Man is a stupid villain that serves no purpose but to cause Superman a minor annoyance. The biggest problem this movie had was that it was way too preachy. The cast might as well have held their hands to their hearts and sang ""God Bless America"".The acting is ridiculously bad. Christopher Reeve seems fed up in the role that made him famous, because he doesn't seem to try anymore. Gene Hackman plays the role of Lex Luthor the same as always, so I'll blame the script for his inadequacies. Mark Pillow (Nuclear Man) is so unbearable that I almost left the rooms during fight scenes.Overall, avoid this movie at all costs. That's all I can say. AT ALL COSTS! 1/10",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
82,bh_tafe3,A chastening rewatch,3,23 January 2016,"I typically used to give myself credit for being fairly smart when I was younger. I remember when this came out on VHS in Australia in 1989 I was really excited and I also really enjoyed it. But the Video Ezy in the Lithgow Valley Shopping Centre lost their copy in 1990 and so I was never able to see it again. Believing that I was missing some magical piece from my child hood, I went out to buy the 2006 Collector' Edition box set, with the 5 theatrical Superman films, and Supergirl. Knowing this film's reputation, I watched it first to find out whether it was the treasure I remember it being. Not only did I sit through one of the most atrociously made movies I've ever seen, but I also realized that when I was 8 and loved this, I must have been a moron.There's a famous story from on the set of this movie that Reeve walked up to one of his co-stars on their first day filming and said something along the lines of ""this is going to be rough, but just grin and get through it."" Reeve, like so many of the people working on this, knew it was a dead movie walking before they got there. I've no idea of the budget, but I'm guessing it wasn't much, and most of what was there was probably spent getting Reeve and Hackman to appear. The most distressing thing about watching this is the deteriorated condition of Margot Kidder (Lois Lane), who we now know was suffering severe mental issues at the time.Hackman returns, and gives his usual solid performance as Lex Luthor, who in this one makes Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow. Yes. Pillow. And after sitting through this, his only film credit, you'll need one), a hair metal reject with long fingernails, to fight Superman, a clever idea seeings as Superman has become obsessed with ridding the world of Nuclear weapons. My understanding of this part of the story is that Reeve was anti-nuclear and so wanted the message in the film and this may have been the main reason he signed up to do it. This may be why Reeve appears to try a lot harder than I would have to make the most of this horrible script. But I can't really talk about the plot. I was overcome by numbness. The greatness of the first two films, Reeve's presence, John Williams' uplifting score: It's all gone. Where had it gone so wrong? How had they squandered a hugely profitable franchise in just 5 or 6 years? It would be 18 years before anyone got another Superman movie off the ground. This is a cheaply made 83 minute funeral dirge. Reeve was right, this was rough, and all he and the cast and crew could do was grin and get through it. Fortunately, as viewers we have another option: turn the damned thing off and never watch it again.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
83,RiffRaffMcKinley,"""The film that killed Superman""? Give me a break",8,5 May 2007,"I cannot stand public opinion about the fourth and final Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" outing. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"", while not the best of the entire series, is better than ""Superman III"" and better than Richard Lester's cartoonish ""Superman II"" (in which Lois Lane actually says, ""I'm going to change into something more comfortable"").First of all, people have claimed that ""IV"" is the most physically ridiculous of all four. This is not true. Yes, for a human to fly in space, they would have to survive being burned up leaving Earth's atmosphere, then survive the vacuum of space (in other words, two people would have been dead by the end of the movie). However, let's revisit the 1978 original, in which the Man of Steel flies around the world, making it spin backwards, which also makes time reverse. If that really happened, every living thing and object on the planet's face would be flung off into the cold depths of space.I won't linger on this anymore. Yes, ""The Quest for Peace"" has unbearable dialogue (in places), but it's classic Superman-- the cheese, the cheap effects, and the general cartoon feel. Plus, it does have Jon Cryer, in what is oddly his best performance of all time (you'd better believe it), and a solid message people still need to think about. In other words, come to believe a man can fly, stay for the inherent message of the movie: we would have to be very stupid to nuke our own planet.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
84,TheHonestCritic,"This movie marks the end of, quite simply, the greatest superhero film series of all-time.",8,1 October 2019,"""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" (1987), this is the last ""Superman"" movie with the one and only, true Man of Steel; Christopher Reeve. He is one of the biggest elements that make this movie worth watching. This movie is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's still much better than any live-action DC film made after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy! This movie has a great story, great acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The special effects are not too bad, but they don't go without their flaws in this movie of course. Probably the most glaring one is the same shot of Superman flying toward the camera over and over and over again. They use the same flying shot 11 times throughout this whole movie! Now, it honestly doesn't anger me like it does for most people lacking a sense of humor. I actually laugh at it and it's fun to watch! The only other glaring special effect issue are the wire shots, which don't really appear until the second half of the movie. Other than that, the special effects are actually decent and utilized to the max given the small budget! The story is interesting, Superman trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons and preventing our global destruction. There are a few subplots, but they all add up and tie the movie together in the end. The acting is great, again, especially from Christopher Reeve. He gives it his all and even with a small budget, you will still believe that a man can fly! Margot Kidder is stellar as Lois Lane as usual, Marc McClure is great as Jimmy Olsen, Jackie Cooper is perfect as Perry White, and Gene Hackman is once again the best Lex Luthor. There are a few new characters introduced into this franchise, and they all do an excellent job as well! Mark Pillow is great as Nuclear Man, Jon Cryer is hilarious as Lenny Luthor, Sam Wanamaker is excellent as David Warfield, and Mariel Hemingway is funny and charming as Lacy Warfield. All of the actors do a great job! They realize that a low budget can't replace the quality of acting. The sets/locations are nice, they look like part of a comic book, which is a neat change of pace in this series. It really gives the movie a nice atmosphere! The soundtrack is excellent. It takes the original brilliant film score of the one and only John Williams, and gives it a different level of depth. Alexander Courage did a fantastic job adapting John Williams' original ""Superman"" musical score! Overall, this movie is a lot of fun and is definitely worth watching. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 stars. Remember, just because a movie has a low budget, does not mean it can't be entertaining. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" is entertaining in every sense of the word, and always will be. To end my review, let us have a moment of silence for the late, but always phenomenal, Christopher Reeve. He has really helped bring this character to life, Christopher Reeve is Superman and he will always be Superman. Rest in Peace, Christopher Reeve. You will always be the one, and the only, true Man of Steel.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Christopher Reeve, I don't care how much influence you can have in the script, you said it yourself: ""The less said about Superman 4, The better"". You would think that the special effects would get better as the series progressed, but no the effects this time around are beyond terrible. The story rubs your face into its anti-nuclear war theme, and the fact that they rehash successful scenes from previous instalments like Lois and Superman flying and the ever changing background of Superman flying towards us.

The actors try really hard, particularly Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Margot Kidder, to make it work. The movie is watchable and the musical score is good. The movie is an improvement over the disappointing Superman III. However, Superman IV has major problems. The movie has obviously been cut from its original length make it incoherent at times. The special effects are below the standards set in the first two movies (even the third movie had decent effects). Maybe if the movie were restored to its original length, it would be better. I can only give this movie a 5/10. I wished it were better and hope someday they do restore this movie to its original length.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
88,Jerghal,Epic disaster,3,9 February 2014,"Not even Ed Wood himself could have made a more amateuristic film than what Superman 4 turned out to be. Worst bluescreen effects ever: superman just seems like a blueish/greenish/reddish cardboard cutout sliding over the screen sideways much like the Terry Gilliam cutouts from Monty Python but here it's not meant to be funny (I think). Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is nothing more then a clownesque nobody assisted by his 'slick' greaser highschool nephew. Superman's nemesis 'Nuclear Man' -created from superman's DNA- turns out to be a 80s hair-metal Neanderthal in spandex who's lines of dialogue consist mainly of 'Arrrghh'. Compared to modern day superman this one looks like a pyjama wearing nerd with his over-sized red underwear on the outside with matching plastic boots. I'm sure he wouldn't draw any attention in a gay bar. They always say films are made in the cutting room but here the editor must have shaken his head and thought there was nothing to be saved. Don't get me started on the plot: christopher reeve co-wrote the story...probably when he was high on LSD or something. (Spoiler) At a certain point in the film superman gets rid of all the nukes in the world by plucking them out of the sky, gathering them in a giant ball and swinging them into the sun. Also people can breathe in space. This film is just a disaster of epic proportions and you really have to see it to believe it. I'm sure this is used in Film Schools around the world as reference material on how NOT to make a film.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
89,illbebackreviews,"A very bad film yet not as bad as the abomination that is, Superman III",3,27 May 2013,"Superman III is not considered to be the worst of the Superman films but now that I've seen Superman III and the abomination that is Superman IV, I can happily say that Superman III is simply far worse than Superman IV which is by no means a good film apart from the fact that it has a few good factors to it such as the returning cast, the character of Superman and the Superman like moments and the overall short duration of the film that ensures us that this film isn't as horrid and stinky as Superman IIISuperman agrees to stop the launch and use of nuclear weapons and begins to put an end to it but by a complete accident, he creates a man of nuclear referred to as NuclearMan whose one task is to kill Superman, under orders from a returned Lex Luthor.Superman is an iconic movie character, respected and even worshipped by some and often labelled the greatest superhero ever made and one of the all time great movie characters. Thanks to Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner, Superman is a worshipped character from the magic of the first two Superman films which portrayed him as an honest, courageous, courteous, brave and determined fighter whereas Superman III didn't really take the character anywhere and explore his sudden evil side. Whilst potential, terrible overuse of slapstick humor and a horrendous story destroyed the film to a point beyond repair. Thankfully, Superman IV got two things perfectly right about the film and that is the character of Superman and how is loyalty to Metropolis as well as Reeves' portrayal who absolutely nails it once more! It was almost a joy to see everything about Superman recovering since Superman III and this is quite simply, the only good aspect of the filmI've never criticized special effects in films and normally, I don't intend to. When you consider how great the effects in the first three Superman films are and how Superman II had a budget of over 50 million and that the latest instalment, which was produced seven years later, has less than $25 million, it is so definitely clear that this film was not to ever be made considering the box office and critical failure of Superman III. The effects in this film look beyond horrendous, even unwatchable especially sequences involving Superman or Nuclearman flying through space or Metropolis. It looks like a terribly edited version on Photoshop where nothing looks realistic enough to take seriously. Sequences involving flying around in Metropolis, especially a scene that ruins Superman in two ways involving Superman taking Lois for yet another fly around Metropolis is not only hard to take seriously, it completely destroys the magical moment from the first film and makes Superman a rather hard character to understand. I guess it's time to get used to him in Superman Returns but thankfully, this is the only instance where Superman is portrayed as a douche. Having taken her for a tour, he gives her a mind erasing kiss (which still makes no sense) in order for her to forget that he is Superman. Simply, the special effects looked horrendous. Even Monty Python and the Holy Grail, being a 1975 picture, had better effects of God!Whilst Christopher Reeve is outstanding as Superman and Gene Hackman is as usual, good as Lex Luthor, the rest of the cast simply aren't interesting even Marc Maclure as Lois Lane, who simply doesn't show the same enthusiasm and passion as she did in the first two. Clearly a bad sign! The acting comes off rather horrendous especially the voice of Nuclearman done by Hackman, who completely makes it truly ridiculous to take seriously. The new characters in this film aren't interesting. The entire story evolving around the Daily Planet is simply stupid and how the story unfolds there is completely ridiculous and to top it off, more and more annoying and one dimensional Superman characters are introduced. Even Lux Luthor himself is uninteresting throughout the film and Nuclearman is a complete waste of some potential.The story, whilst having potential, simply doesn't turn out to be anything special or even remotely, interesting. Much of the film is simply boring and thankfully, clichéd slapstick is not thrown into the film to make it worse! It definitely has a Superman feel to it and in some ways, had some great sequences such as the scene involving Kal-El's Kryptonian ancestors where they warn him to stay away from human affairs. However, this scene is completely betrayed later in the film and much of the individual scenes taking place in the film are completely unnecessary and are rip offs from the first two films.Overall, in some ways I cannot understand how loathed this film is yet Superman III is allowed a free pass. It just shocks me to see how this film is the most hated of them all but honestly, whilst a terrible film is made to be a great film when watching immediately after Superman III. A lack of stupid slapstick and a computer villain make this a better film than its predecessor but still not a good film by any means.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
90,Olicosmic,An insult to both Superman fans and film fans alike,1,7 May 2019,"After the severely lackluster Superman 3, many thought there was no where to go, but up. Somehow, this film did the absolute impossible by being even worse in every way. The story is predictable, sloppy, stupid, and unfocused, the performances are very one note, the script is poor, the editing/production is possibly the worst I've ever seen in a big budget film, as this looks anything but, and the fun that the first 2 Superman films had is completely gone. Even the campyness of the 3rd one is gone. This whole film is just depressing in every way, because it takes the series, and brings it to subterranean lows that not even the 3rd did, even for how bad that film was. Everything about this film is just lazy. Lazy, lazy, lazy. The editing is out of whack, the effects are complete and utter jokes, as they even look way worse than the ones in the early movies from the 70s, which there is no excuse for, since this film was made in the 1987. The writing has many plot holes and no cohesion, the premise is stupid with not a whole lot of thought, etc. My point is that this film is possibly one of, if not the laziest superhero film ever made, and the fact that it turned out this way, especially compared to the first 2 Superman films, it's severely depressing and disappointing, which is why I can't recommend this to anyone whatsoever, as there's literally nothing going for this film in any way, as it all just feels like a 2nd thought rather than an actual film. Hell, even new YouTubers could make a better film, because this is not only embarrassing, but also an insult to both Superman fans and film fans alike. Superman didn't deserve this. The more we can forget about this dumpster fire, the better.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
91,rparham,"A ""Super"" disaster",2,22 June 2006,"After an absence of four years, along with Christopher Reeve's initial determination he was done with the blue and red tights after Superman III, the Superman franchise was brought back to life for one more entry, but after the release of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, it's unfortunate that everyone involved hadn't just decided to let things alone. Superman IV is a complete disaster on almost every level, a silly, cheesy and downright cheap looking poor excuse for a film that manages to rank among the worst comic book adaptation films of all time, bested only by such ""winners"" as The Return of Swamp Thing and the direct-to-video Captain America.Superman IV finds our hero, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve), selling off his family farm after his mother has died between performing his normal super duties. He returns to Metropolis to discover that the Daily Planet has been taken over by tabloid king David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemmingway) and are turning it into a salacious rag sheet. Shortly after the takeover, a young boy writes Superman a letter, via the Daily Planet, and asks him for assistance in solving the arms crisis by removing all nuclear weapons from the Earth. Superman initially refuses, taking the stance that he cannot interfere in human affairs (although how this relates to his other helping of humanity is a puzzler). Eventually, Superman changes his mind and begins ridding the world of all nuclear weapons by tossing them into the sun.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has escaped from prison with the assistance of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer), and hatched a devious scheme: to create a new super villain to defeat Superman by taking a sample of Superman's DNA recovered from a museum exhibit featuring a single hair from Superman's head and attaching it and a computer to the side of one of the missiles that are hurled into the sun by Superman and thus creating Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman), a being with the power of Superman, the voice of Lex Luthor, plus more abilities, powered by the sun. The two match off, but has Superman finally met his rival? It's not really surprising that Superman IV is terrible movie, considering it was produced by The Canon Group, who may never have released what you could label a ""good"" movie when they existed in the '80s. And Superman IV is not a good movie. It has an intriguing concept at it's heart, Superman ridding the world of nuclear devices, but everything around that central idea is just a complete mess. The script by Laurence Konner and Mark Rosenthal is borderline insipid, featuring some extreme gaps in logic that cause the audience to have to accept some absolutely ridiculous contrivances and just asinine ideas. Superman tosses a missile containing Nuclear Man's basic building blocks into the sun. And how is that not all fried by the sun? Okay, maybe the Superman genetic material may not be (although I don't know if it was ever stated he is able to withstand even the sun), but the computer that will supposedly give Nuclear Man form, along with the barest shreds of material that suddenly grow into clothes to cover his body? Please. And how does he get Lex's voice? Late in the film, a human character is carried into space by Nuclear Man with no oxygen or protective suit, and survives. The complete contempt for the audience the script shows is inexcusable.With Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) still pulling a mostly supporting role, the writers attempt to inject Lacy as a new love interest, with her eye on Clark instead of Superman. They also try to generate a triangle between them, but none of it works. There is no chemistry between Lacy and Clark, and much of what was there between Superman and Lois seems to be gone or on life support. Yeah, Lex Luthor is back, but he is nowhere near as engaging as he was in Superman and Superman II. Hackman does the best he can with his questionable material, but there is no saving it.Many of the outstanding aspects of the previous films are just shoddy this time around. The special effects are abysmal, with many generic elements of Superman flying reused over and over again and almost none of it is believable. The action sequences, what few there are, are unspectacular and barely raise your pulse. The film, on the whole, has a rushed and half-complete feeling to it, and you get the impression you are watching a movie made on the cheap, not the latest sequel to a successful, multi-million dollar grossing franchise.So, after close to ten years and three sequels, Supeman IV is able to do what Lex Luthor could never accomplish: it brought the Man of Steel down, and left him tattered. It would take almost two decades for Superman to fly again, and we can only hope that the next entry is worth your time, because this one wasn't.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
92,Old Joe,"The Quest for peace, without much tranquillity",4,2 February 2001,"Well to say that the final chapter in the Superman series was a big let down is an understatement. I have read many people's opinion on this movie and agree that it could have been a way better film. Though the film's theme does have some merit attached to it.Superman IV is about the man of steel grappling with his emotions of his now home planet, Earth. He is afraid the planet could suffer the same fate as his mother planet Krypton. Superman agrees to rid the planet of the threat of nuclear war. But the mastermind of the greatest criminal in the modern era, Lex Luthor, uses the Superman peace bid to create ciaos. His new creation is a Frankenstein like being, a Nuclear Man. Can Superman stop the Earth from blowing itself up?Actors such as Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman were crazy when they agreed to do this film. I know that Reeve helped to write the story to this film, and the whole nuclear war theme was quite fine. But tell me if I am wrong, the big screen version never turned out the way it was suppose to? Reeve was good again as Clark Kent/Superman (but only when his feet were on the ground). The flying sequences in this Superman were atrocious. Scenes like when Lois Lane and Superman fly around together. These scenes look fake. The original Superman gave me the impression that this bloke really could fly. But this film makes a mockery of the Superman name. I must commend the speech of Superman to the world congress on nuclear war, it was quite touching and when you watch the movie up to this point, I thought hey this might be alright. But how wrong was I?Gene Hackman made the role of Lex Luthor his own. Yet, I am amazed he even wanted anything to do with reprising the Luthor role. Not that he was bad, but the film itself was. Hackman since then, has had to reinvent himself in films like Enemy of the state, which I enjoyed immensely. It is only lucky he didn't ruin his whole career. Another of his better films was the Quick and the Dead, starring alongside Hollywood beauty Sharon Stone. Margot Kidder was back in Superman IV and I did enjoy parts of her in this. Lois' emotions towards Superman were well acted by Kidder. Looking at Kidder's career since this film nothing really stands out to me though. Margot has had bad luck in the last ten years, being in a serious car crash, managing maniac depression and requiring psychiatric care. I do remember that she went through a tough trot.I will tell you which cast members weren't quite that super. First of all, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). It is fine to have a menacing look about you, but aren't you suppose to able to act a bit also? Pillow was a terrible choice in this role. The other point is that I haven't seen or heard anything of this guy since. The other crappy part to his role was that Gene Hackman supplied the voice of his character. The Nuclear man character was ok, but could have had a better actor playing him. Then you have the attractive actress Mariel Hemingway, who played Lacy Warfield. The daughter of tycoon David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker). As good looking as Hemingway is, her character in this was of no importance at all. Likewise Wanamaker, who just makes up the numbers, plus the whole take over bid of the Daily Planet didn't make much sense to me. Last of all I want to talk about Jon Cryer. He played Luthor's nerdy nephew, Lenny. He was terrible and a complete waste of time being in this film in my view. I also read somewhere, has anyone seen Jon Cryer since Superman IV? My answer to that is yes, in a film titled Holy Man starring would you believe Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and the gorgeous Kelly Preston.I have mentioned some scenes in Superman IV that I liked and that I disliked. Another favourite was when Lacy and Lois had a double date with Clark and Superman. This scene was well acted and cleverly done. Superman was up and down this tall building for the entire scene. Reeve's talent's again shone through with this. The only problem with this scene was that it totally gives away who Superman's secret identity really is. Anyone in their right mind should know after having a double date with the guy. The worst scene in the film is when Nuclear man takes Lacy Warfield after falling in love with her. Superman discovers that Nuclear man's energy comes from the sun and shifts the moon's orbit to block the sun. Meanwhile Lacy is dragged into outer space. I don't know who got this wrong, but no earthling can breathe in space without help can they? So why didn't Lacy die huh?The other dilemma this film had was that the budget was cut back. After a test screening, it was reduced from 134 to 90 minutes. I say that the edit button destroyed this film. Scenes were deleted or cut. It might (I stress might) have helped if I could have seen the whole film. I read the book to Superman IV and admit that I actually enjoyed reading it. I hope we get to see what was taken out of this film on the DVD of Superman IV.All in all this was a movie which probably never had a chance to succeed. With poor special effects, ordinary cast and a shortened version that really did kill it. I want to wish Christopher Reeve all the best in his recovery from his quadriplegia. I will always remember him as Superman, on the big screen and in real life. I am afraid to say that this film gave Superman a bad name.Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars or 4/10.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

96,David_Frames,"""Then die like you deserve to!""",2,11 November 2006,"The years have conferred cruel nicknames upon it, Superman 4 F*ck's sake!, Superman IV: Rest In Peace, The one I didn't see and so on. In fact part 3's Annette O'Toole (Lana Lang) delivered its most devastating critique, remarking simply ""they made a forth one?"" Yes, these cine-bullies have rounded on the third Super-sequel like a whore to a City Trader's wallet and though the criticism should be immense, it isn't the horror some would tell you it isthough it's pretty close.So how did a movie that made $350M in domestic adjusted dollars do a Jaws, and spawn such a miserable third sequel? What was it about the year 1987, did someone kill all the best filmmakers that year? The Quest for Peace plays like a bloody knife in your husband's raincoat, suggesting we should be looking for bodies rather than apportioning blame. Blame is the game though so here we go – Having killed the secret of their success by firing Richard Donner and his script doctor Tom Mankewitcz, the Salkinds, those Icelandic imbeciles with next to no understanding of what made Superman work, had cocked up Superman III by turning it into a camp escapade with Richard Lester throwing the custard pies. Imagining that the audience had lost interest in Supes rather than hating what they'd done to him in the 1983 instalment, they soiled the suite further by inflicting Supergirl on an audience still licking its wounds. When that failed the sultans of Santa Clause: the Movie decided to get out of the super-business and sold the rights to Golan and Golbus, Hollywood moguls from, er, Israel, with all the creative zeal of a lobotomised organutang.1987 was a big year for the GG's as no-one referred to them on account of Golbus' rumoured resemblance to a horse. They were also making Masters of the Universe, another 'hot property' but the gruesome twosome were spreading themselves a little thin – in short, the money wasn't quite pouring in as they might like. With other projects requiring life support, these geniuses took much of the $40M Warners had given them for Superman and spent iton something else!!! Possibly on air fares to Israel. The logic is obvious – why would you need to spend money on a Superman movie? Its total lack of visual effects or international locations would make it ripe for downsizing. Thus as the Reeve was lured back in exchange for amongst other things, story input, the budget was halved and the result speaks for itself – on a shoestring? The crew on this one couldn't afford stringor shoes.The total and soul destroying shame of Superman IV is that it could and should have been a wonderful swansong for Reeve in the title role. His nuclear disarmament theme, much derided, was in fact an honourable stab at giving the man of steel a meaty, real world problem to solve as well as returning the series to the more serious tone of the first two films. Unfortunately the script has no intention of doing serious, generally veering from infantile to ridiculous. It's the kind of screenplay that says 'we're not getting paid enough here' (which they probably weren't) but worse, 'we don't give a stuff'. But poor though it is – little wit or character development to be found here, what really kills Superman IV is the aforementioned budget. Even at a truncated 86 minutes it's embarrassing to watch a movie which feels so amateurishly produced and poorly made. The visual effects are, for the most part, atrocious. They would have dated instantly; in fact much of the work could be bettered today using the most basic effects software available. Unfair perhaps but given the quality of SFX at this time, the lack of money spent on them is unforgivable. If anything is going to pull you out of a movie, no matter how good the story or likable the characters, its seeing the strings – in this case literally. Reeve as ever is impossible to dislike and makes the worst of it bearable but the sheer thriftiness of it, Milton Keanes doubling for New York for example (!), is enough to incite you to crush Golan's Globus' with extreme prejudice. From the rubble there's also a fairly decent score by John Williams and Star Trek's Alexander Courage but even there it sounds as though the budget didn't stretch to an orchestra, the music having a tinny, synthesised quality to it in places. Brutalised in production, murdered in the editing suite with over 40 minutes excised (but in sympathy to the editor he must have had plenty of unusable footage, much of which he'd reluctantly have to have locked into the final cut) this last Superman (not counting Returns as it doesn't count this) is an abject lesson in poor production management and how to slay a cash cow with utter unmitigated contempt. Christ, Reeve probably laughed harder on the day he was paralysed.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

98,LuboLarsson,A mess,2,11 September 2006,"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a disaster, less than ten years after the wonderful Superman The Movie the series has been downgraded to a cheap Cannon film. Most people know now that Cannon slashed the budget for this film just before it was to be filmed and it is impossible to make a Superman movie on the cheap. These films are very reliant on their special effects, we must believe Superman is flying and using all his various Super powers and this film just didn't have the budget to convince the audience. The same awful effect of a greenish Superman flying towards the screen is used over and over again, every special effect looks cheap and nasty. If thats not bad enough the story is very poor and makes little sense. I felt sorry for the actors and the director as they were on a loser from the start. Christopher Reeve looks like he knows he is making a bad film and gives easily his worst performance as Superman and even more so as Clark Kent, also he must take some of the blame as he came up with the dodgy ""rid the world of nuclear missiles story"". Funny thing is even though the whole world knows Superman is going to pluck all the missiles out of the air and throw them into the sun they continue to launch them! Why not just say OK fair enough just take them all Superman, oh and by the way what exactly is going to stop the Red Army from marching across Europe now Supes? The UK for instance would have had no Nuclear Detterent??? But I don't really want to get bogged down in the whole Political side of this film, neither did Reeve's either as his story seems just an excuse for Lex Luthor to release the worst villain in any Superhero movie, Nuclear Man, or maybe Mulletman... whatever, he looks more like the lead singer of Whitesnake than a credible villain. Also on the acting side even Gene Hackman who is nearly always fantastic doesn't look in the mood to put the effort in. The less said about Jon Cryer and Marc Pillow the better, they are poor substitutes for Ned Beattie and Terence Stamp from the first two Superman films.

99,georgewilliamnoble,Much worse than I remembered.,3,19 July 2021,I will try to be brief but frank but the bottom line is this film Is a car crash. Well published financial muddling at production company level led to production troubles and massive budget cuts and what became Superman 4 runs for just 89 minutes including titles with 40 minutes left on the cutting room floor. What is on screen looks cheap with poor story telling and rotten special effects and the nuclear man story carries no punch it is simply tame and lame. As a fan of the original I remember well taking in the movie at my old local cinema and leaving bitterly disappointed I had not seen the movie since until I watched this blue ray and time had not improved any of it. Christopher Reeve does the best he can in the circumstances and the John Williams theme music is as good as ever but this is a very poor movie that audiences at the time mostly avoided and wisely for Superman 4 with it's pretentious quest for peace serves only as an example of how not to make a movie.,Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

He brought a noble enough idea; Superman helping the world to disarm. But in the end, this film lacked no creative punch.The once ground breaking effects look outdated and mediocre at best. We once were made to believe a man could fly. Now it was old hat and nothing new or innovative was being done to take us beyond that.Everyone, to include Reeve, seem to be in this film out of obligation more than any other reason.

101,rcolgan,A Superhero Film On Par With The SyFy Shark Movies,3,11 June 2014,"The release of Superman 4 had many negative repercussions on those involved. Firstly it bombed at the box office, making only 15 million of its already low 17 million budget back. Secondly, it is recognised as causing the death of the live action superman franchise until Bryan Singers Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Reeve even recognised this film as the greatest failure of his career. Unfortunately all this is well founded as Superman 4 is amongst the worst superhero films due to the film getting almost everything wrong, short of having Super nipples. It tried to steer away from the comedy of the Lester Superman, but unfortunately had neither the drama nor action needed to do so. Reeve had credit in this film as writing the story. However there is good reason why this was Reeves only film writing credit as with a story this poor there was never any chance of the film being a success. The films title is very literal in that Superman is on a quest for peace by attempting to get rid of all the nuclear weapons on earth by gathering them all up and hurling them in to the sun. Yes, the film uses the logic that nuclear weapons are the real cause of war and it has little to do with those who have the weapons.Throughout it really tries to rub it in the viewers face that nuclear weapons are bad, as demonstrated by the villain named Nuclear Man. He's created by Luthor when he puts Supermans DNA to one of the missiles that Superman is hurling into the sun. Through this Luthor harnesses the sun's nuclear energy to create him and attempts to destroy Superman. Why the film didn't just use one of the many already existing villains in the Superman Roster like Bizarro is simply to reflect the message of nuclear weapons. The problem is by trying to simplify the concept of nuclear war, the message isn't being fed to us as much as it's being forced down our throats. Beyond this I suspect that in the 80's people already had the knowledge that nuclear weapons were dangerous without the guidance of Superman. Mixed with this are a lot of pointless subplots which get no focus and many of which don't even get a conclusion. For example a girl named Lacy falls in love with Clark Kent for no other reason than the script demands it. A lot of time is devoted to antics such as Clark having to juggle a double date with both Lois and her by switching between Clark and Superman. But at the end of the film then it just feels like the film forgets entirely about the sub plot. Partly this could be because there are many scenes in the original that were either cut or unreleased due to budget being cut from 36 million dollars to 17 million just before filming was about to begin. This meant they could not film some scenes and others were unusable leading to a gaping number of plot holes in the films.These budget cuts also led to the film having awful special effects which are comparable to the special effects of films like Shark Attack 3. This is why throughout the film you'll see the same shot of superman flying several times as a way of cutting costs. These terrible effects lead to what I would have to call one of the worst fights in a superhero film with a mixture of the worst effects and the worst fight choreography I've seen in film. All they seem to do is throw each other and fly away. Mixed with this are some ridiculously over the top moments such as Superman repairing the Great Wall of China or putting back the statue of liberty. All of this goes together to making this into the worst Superman movie. I can see why this film ended the franchise for so long as failed in almost every way from the script filled with plot holes, awful special effects and the lack of humour making it the worst of the Superman franchise by a long shot. Saying that, this film does fall under the ""so bad it's funny"" category as it's funny to see just how many major plot holes there are ranging from a woman breathing in space to Superman going from near dead to one scene to alive and well in the next. But based on the political message this film was trying to be it was most certainly a failure.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
102,jwpeel-1,No worse than the '60s comic books,5,31 July 2004,"I don't know how many of you followed the comic books in the 1960s as I did, but this was the period when Marvel was getting all the comic book readers that were leaving DC in the dust.  That was because the stories got increasingly juvenile and silly, and tried to too hard to be decent and honorable and a teacher of sorts.  In other words... boring!    Yet even in this time, the DC comics were simple fun escapism and the artwork of Curt Swan made it palatable to the eye. The same could be said of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace.  The budget was obviously lower and the platitudes higher (due to Christopher Reeve's need to make a statement about nuclear proliferation) but the film as its moments of excitement, particularly in the scene between Superman and the manufactured super-villain of Lex Luthor, a sort of Sun-Man.    I still prefer it to be second film in the series. That one, at least for me, really bit the big one. That's why I rate it higher than Superman II.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
103,T-ZER0,Give it a chance,8,28 May 2019,"The fact that people say that Christopher Reeve was an idiot to act in this or that this insults his legacy breaks my heart. Reeve himself wrote some of this film, and I think he gave it a really good message. I particularly love the scene where he says:
""There will be peace when the people of the world want it so badly, their governments will have no choice but to give it to them.""
Superman IV did not have a large budget like the previous films, because of this I know what ways it suffered. But it inspired so many comic book stuff, like Doomsday and Cat Grant were inspired from Nuclear Man and Lacy Warfield. Which those actors don't deserve the hate they get for this film. I thought Mariel Hemingway did a lovely job as Lacy, and despite his cheesy role, Mark Pillow did what he could.
I think this movie deserves a second chance because it's message was about peace, which is what modern Superman movies like Man of Steel ignore greatly. This is still a Superman movie worth seeing and it doesn't deserve to be on the worst films of all time list.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

105,moviemattb,"The end of the franchise, and for Christopher Reeve",2,9 September 2015,"After going through the painful territory for ""Superman III,"" I have now gone myself to the stupidity territory of ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."" This is the end of the franchise, and for Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and Superman. The plot of the movie is pretty much lame, because it is really about Superman who is going to rigged the world of all nuclear weapons while Lex Luthor escapes from prison with the help of his nephew as they create their own Superman as he was born from the sun with all the nuclear solar powers to become Nuclear Man or something like that. Sorry for not giving you much detail about the plot, because the movie itself actually goes completely nowhere. Its amazing how this franchise went completely downhill, where you start off something amazing to a travesty. If this movie didn't killed the franchise, then the Salkinds didn't have to fire Richard Donner for ""Superman II"" so that he can finish the movie 100 percent, and have Tom Mankiewicz (on IMDb trivia for ""Superman III"") direct ""Superman III;"" if it stays like, then it would be either a great trilogy or make four or five ""Superman"" movies so that this franchise would stay strong, and very much ended on a satisfactory note. But no, Donner got fired so the Salkinds would bring Richard Lester to direct ""Superman II"" (which I still enjoy, but Donner's cut is better) and ""Superman III"" so they would go into camp factor, and have Richard Pryor in the third movie. Now, for the fourth movie, the Salkinds gave up and sold it to Golan-Globus' Cannon Films to produce the movie, which it definitely makes matters worse. The special effects in this movie are just awful. How awful? The budget was originally 36 million dollars, but as Cannon Films was into financial problems, they slashed the budget to 17 million dollars as they kept reusing effects like Superman flying right into the camera and have it poorly composite. I wish if they hadn't slashed its original budget, so that effects wouldn't look like this. The only good effect is the same footage from the first three movies that ends with Superman flying into space, and smiles at the camera. You really if the effects for this movie are just as good as the first three, and maybe keep getting better at it. The movie is directed by Sidney J. Furie, who is a director that I am not familiar with has not done a great job on making this movie, and I wonder if he wasn't satisfied the way how the movie is presented; if he admitted it, then I would forgive him. The story itself isn't that well told, but it comes to a shocked that Christopher Reeve co-wrote the screenplay. I remember watching videos of him on YouTube, where he said that he wasn't satisfied with the third one so he can make a ""Superman"" movie that he want to see so it can be as good as the first two, and pretty much forget about three. I'll give him credit for that for at least trying to come up with a better story, but sadly it was not well executed as Reeve himself isn't satisfied with this movie as he hoped for the way he envisioned. The action isn't really that good either, and I really don't have much comment on the music so its really just there. This movie is filled with a bunch of errors like the child actor that plays Jeremy disappears out of nowhere, Nuclear Man kidnaps Lacy as he takes her to space as she can breath perfectly fine, Superman moving the moon, fixing the great wall of China and Superman getting sick as we never see how is able to recover, when he has that darn green crystal in his hands. Wow, movie! I mean, wow! Now, after my issues with this movie, is there anything that I liked? I hate to admit, but the movie is filled with great actors who very much wasted on such great talents. Most of the actors and actresses gave their all, but pretty much ended up by going into a bad direction. I don't have much comments on either Mariel Hemingway or Mark Pillow as Lacy and Nuclear Man, because they're just there and don't care whether they did good or bad. However, it is nice to see Gene Hackman returning as Lex Luthor as he did his best with a bad script, but don't think he did good as the voice of Nuclear Man which I find it pretty silly. I really don't care for his nephew as he is played by Jon Cryer. Margot Kidder does her best to as Lois Lane, and I really wish if there was more romance between her character and Superman. Oh, I forgot to mention that she does remember that Superman's real name is Kal-El as that erased memory kissed didn't help from the second one, and now Superman erases her memories again. Well, gee, that was pretty pointless. As for Christopher Reeve, it is sad that this was the last time that we ever seen him to play both Clark Kent and Superman, until his passing on October 10, 2004; he still is giving a great performance and whenever he is on screen you know that he will always be Superman as his legacy will live on forever. We surely do miss him, and I know many fans will still remember him. Even me. With that said, ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" hits the nail of the coffin for killing the franchise as he returns to the big screen in ""Superman Return,"" then he disappears, and reappears again in ""Man of Steel.""

112,Tyson14,Superman Iv the quest for nonsense,1,16 August 2014,"That alternate title just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?Superman has always been known for it's...unique approach in turning 'science' into a deus ex machinae to achieve anything the plot demands, and in Superman IV the film takes the same approach to morals and international politics. Instead of just foiling super villains and saving the world as usual, the clowns at Golan-Globus decided to use the comic medium as a diatribe against nuclear weapons...for in Superman IV it's not dastardly super villains or cunning plots that are the real danger...it's just nukes. Nukes, and Lex Luthor.I shouldn't have to remind you that there's probably nobody on earth who isn't afraid of nuclear war. It's one of the scariest threats to modern civilisation. That said, the way this film simplifies the ideas of war and international relations is completely ridiculous. Forget that the threat of mutually assured destruction may have actually helped to prevent conventional wars, and forget that without nuclear arsenals many nations on this planet would probably be under serious threat, Superman IV takes the approach that things would just be peachy if all the nukes were just destroyed. Who's going to make sure nobody builds more, and who is going to stop nations like Israel from being utterly squashed after Superman takes all the nukes away? Who really cares? The movies approach to this very serious issue is completely absurd, and serves as a lesson on what NOT to do with your super hero movie. It's morals are as confused as the idiots who green lighted this idea.With that out of the way, there's plenty of other reasons to hate this film. The writing is laughable, the characters (namely Lenny Luthor) are annoying, and the special effects are horrendous. Unlike the first films, Superman IV over uses the same practical and green screen effects countless times. The movie's 'dumb' in the sense that science, once again, does anything the script demands. Humans breathing in space and Superman moving the moon out of orbit to fight nuclear man are just a couple examples of how childish this film gets. I can buy Superman's 'mind erasing kiss' or even him flying back in time if it's only happening once and a while, but in Superman IV every time I hear Luthor talk about how the sun is just a 'big bomb' or anything like this I just want to cringe.'Nuclear Man' seems like an interesting idea for a villain, but the way he's created and just about everything about him is hilariously bad. This villain looks like a surfer-dude in a bad, chopped up, power rangers costume. Thanks to bad special effects and terrible fighting choreography, the action sequences are about as boring as everything else about this film.If you enjoyed Reeves' other Superman films but haven't seen this one yet, do yourself a favour and don't.

113,23skidoo-4,Starts OK but goes pear-shaped,3,14 January 2007,"(This review contains potential spoilers)I'm probably being generous with 3 stars, but for the first 45 minutes or so, Superman IV isn't a bad little film. Granted, it's instantly obvious the budget is a fraction of what had been used for the first 3 films, and Luthor's nephew is a terrible 80s teen ""dude!"" stereotype. But the opening sequences with Clark visiting the old farm in Smallville and the return of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane are both welcome. Mariel Hemingway provides a sexy third side to the film's romantic triangle ... but it could be argued a film like this didn't need that.It had been 10 years since the first Superman was filmed, and this gives the regular actors added depth as they played their familiar roles. Gene Hackman is an exception, playing Luthor a bit too low key for the character's own good. At about the 45-50 minutes mark, things start to collapse as the close-to-an-hour's worth of deleted scenes begin to take their toll on the film -- for example, suddenly Clark looks all grey-haired and dying with no real reason given. And while the battle between Superman and Nuclear Man is clearly inspired by the comic books -- and would have worked well in the comics -- in live action, it just comes off as silly. And when the filmmakers abandon any pretense to reality (by, among other things, having a human character survive hanging around in the vacuum of space) the film just falls apart.The film is worth seeing, though, for the byplay between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. It's a pity the opportunity was lost in Superman III to expand on this more when Kidder was written out of the film. But, as the fourth entry in a franchise that began with the spectacular Superman I and Superman II, this film is an extreme disappointment -- though, at the same time, it's one of those films that seems ripe for the remastering/directors edition/upgrading routine that has been done with other films.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

There's certainly something off about this film when that is one of the smaller problems with it. The main problem with this film is it meanders around the plot. There are sub-plots that come in, take up screen-time and don't really have a proper pay-off. The way in which the villain Nuclear Man is established is weirdly convoluted and takes up so much time that he when he finally arrives about two thirds through the film, the conflict with him feels rushed, like they had a series of superhero cliches they needed to tick off a list in the shortest amount of time. In the midst of all this, there's meant to be some commentary on peace, but it's completely lost in the producers' quest for a generic hero versus villain superhero film. This film is a mess. It might not be as bad as some comic book fans like to make out, but it is not a good film. Fortunately, nowadays there are good superhero films that have tackled the question of peace far more effectively. 3/10",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
115,ryanskywalker-87402,Stop the people!!!!!,1,4 April 2017,"My film knowledge is clearly wanting, because I found out only yesterday that Milton Keynes doubled Metropolis during the making of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace - a fact which alone sums up the scope, ambition and grandeur of Sidney J Furies's nail in the Man of Steel's cinematic coffin for almost twenty years. Looking back, it's so apparent what different an age these Superman movies lived in, a 1980's where comic-book movies were seen as disposable fluff, certainly not keeping up with the tide of seminal graphic novels that only now is cinema truly catching up with. The Quest for Peace is very close to being an outright abomination, saved primarily by the goodwill radiating from the whole thing... saved not enough, mind you, to prevent rendering it as possibly the worst comic-book movie ever made, or certainly close to its pure nadir.You could cite a million problems. Story. Script. Production. Casting. It's pretty much got the lot, which in itself is an achievement. The low budget means Furie has to shoot in wholly unrepresentative locations that are so far away from the classy glamour of the first movie it's unreal, while ironically given Hollywood was on the verge of CGI breakthroughs around this time, the effects are the shoddiest of all four movies; the story starts in earnest fashion, with the interesting notion of Superman being called upon to interject in a nuclear arms race (though given, at this point, America & Russia were practically bowling buddies, it's not exactly razor sharp political commentary) utterly shattered when it descends (after a bizarre sequence where Supes throws ALL the nukes INTO THE SUN - surely that's a terrible idea, scientists?) into yet another dumb Lex Luthor farce of a plan and introduces the most laughable antagonist in comic-book history... NUCLEAR MAN! Oooooh! Run from his poodle perm! Hide from the daft lycra suit somehow created by the mad Frankenstein physics that creates him! Duck when he swipes you with his long, trimmed nails! I genuinely am not exaggerating about this guy... seriously, if he'd been accompanied throughout by Pepsi & Shirley, they would not have seemed out of place. In a way, he's brilliant for comedy - you try and fathom WHY he picks up the Statue of Liberty and decides to lob it down on a New York street. Good luck with that. He's just... amazingly awful, and once he turns up it just descends into the worst battle for supremacy you're ever likely to see on film. Poor Gene Hackman - he should have carved a comic-book legacy as Luthor, sadly he may just be remembered for all the wrong reasons when it comes to these films... I just hope he got paid well, frankly.Is it all bad? Well... yes. Almost. I feel most sorry for Christopher Reeve - what a way to exit his most iconic role, though admittedly he didn't necessarily know it'd be his last, but he must have known this was garbage. He does gamely well, in fairness, as charming and effortless as ever, and way above the material. Ditto Margot Kidder, reinstated properly here as Lois Lane, who gives possibly her sleekest & most assured performance in the role, again despite working with detritus (and having to share too much screen time with Mariel Hemingway's wet lettuce love rival). Those two just--just--make watching this worthwhile but only, truly, if you are a Superman completest. No, really.Superman IV has a lot to answer for, really. It--and the preceeding movie--meant very few movie makers in Hollywood took the superhero genre seriously for a long, long time and though Tim Burton's Batman would level the playing field a little more soon after, The Quest for Peace truly showed how not to treat Superman or his genre.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
116,mercury4,I take back what I said,10,20 January 2002,"I wrote a review of this telling you how bad it was. I changed my mind. I actually enjoy the movie. I used to watch it only to laugh at it, but it turned out later I wasn't watching it anymore to laugh. I love this movie. It's not as good as the other Superman movies in the series, but it is still good. I also used to say that Mark Pillow was horrible as Nuclear Man because of how corny he was. I was wrong. He is good as Nuclear Man because the way he is you would think you were reading a comic. Christopher Reeve of course is great as Superman and I enjoyed the acting of his co-stars. I complained about the special effects, but I read about how much trouble the filmmakers went through to get this movie finished. One thing though that still stands as something I dislike is one, the mistake in the end of having Nuclear Man fly Lacey Warfield up into space and two, the fight on the moon. There are some good moments in the moon fight, but Superman acts like a wimp in some parts and doesn't know how to fight. He stomps on Nuclear Man's foot, he takes Nuclear Man's head and brings it into his knee and he tries to kick(tap) Nuclear Man and it results in Nuclear Man throwing him. But one last thing about the scene that I love is how Superman walks over to the American flag and stands it back up. Great stuff. There are only plot holes in the movie because a lot of it was cut because of idiots in Orange County that didn't like it. Thanks to them we have a movie second rate to the original version.

117,charlieoso,Worst of the Superman Films,4,31 January 2021,"While certainly the worst Superman movie, it is not because it is boring or slow-paced. In fact it moves along much better than the previous three. The big reason is the effects are a major downgrade from the earlier entries and in the end only were able to get half the budget that was used in the previous entry. It is rather obvious and Christopher Reeve's ability to play Superman and John Williams' great score alone can not carry the picture.Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is broken out of jail by his moronic nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) so that he can create his own superhero or supervillain in Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). Once the two face off you should be welcomed to a great cinema fight, but you must undergo and witness some brutal flying scenes and grade Z effects.Reeve, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal wrote the story, Konner & Rosenthal the screenplay, but it is interesting because I can tell there actually is a good movie somewhere inside it, just needed a bigger budget and perhaps more story. Supposedly there were multiple scenes shot that were not included in the final cut. As well Wes Craven was originally set to direct, but he and Reeve did not get along well and then Sidney J. Furie was brought on board to direct.

118,superboy478,A Mediocre Sequel,5,27 February 2002,"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a good movie, but it was a failure in my opinion. It was great seeing the Superman cast back together again, including Gene Hackman who we haven't seen since Superman II. This time, Alexander and Ilya Salkind were not producing the movie. Instead, Menaham Golan and Yoram Globus, the owners of Cannon films, were producing. If you ask me, the Salkinds knew how to make a Superman movie better than those two. In Superman IV, Superman hears the threat of Nuclear War over and over, and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man. At the same time, Lex Luthor has broken out of jail again and this time, his sidekick is his dorky nephew Lenny. The two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating Nuclear Man. Nuclear Man has the same powers as Superman but, the only difference is that Nuclear Man gets his power from the sun.
While all of this is going on, The Dailey Planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on Clark Kent.
So Superman has a big job here: SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!I'm going to say that, anyone who has seen the first three Superman films, then just go ahead and see IV because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series.

But at the same time, they had good enough plots, effects, and performances to make you willing to overlook the problems for the most part. Not so with this waste of celluloid.The effects are the worst part. One head-on flying shot is used at least four times through the movie! And it wasn't well done to begin with. The rest of the thankfully sparse effects were even worse, up to (or DOWN to) the ludicrous fight on the Moon.Very nearly as bad was the plot. When it wasn't utterly forgettable (85% of the movie), it was excruciating. It's hard to believe that co-writer Lawrence Konner was involved in the writing of Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country. There were reports that this movie suffered badly because it was cut severely for the theatrical release, but it's difficult if not impossible to imagine more scenes doing anything but making us squirm more in our seats.Then there was the acting. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man: I think that says it all. Ugh. Jon Cryer was somewhere between Pillow's performance and fingernails on chalkboard. Only somewhat less competent was the child actor whose character gets Superman to start questioning the wisdom of nuclear weapons.

I guess it was true that Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (and what a joke that title is) was the final nail in the coffin for the Superman films, at least until it was rebooted with ""Superman Returns"". While the first film could make you believe that a man could fly, here, you'd probably think he was sailing along on wires behind a green screen. So what was so bad about this film? For those of you who haven't seen the film, basically, it's about Superman stopping nuclear arms conflict and beating up a guy who was created from a strand of his hair. Oh, and there's some other stuff about Clark going on a date and some old guy trying to take over the Daily Planet. That's about it.Where do I begin? The lame storyline? The truly atrocious acting? The god-awful special effects? It honestly boggles my mind to see how the franchise went from a blockbuster starring Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve, to a piece of tripe starring Reeve and Hackman as caricatures of themselves. It feels like everyone is just hamming it up in this picture, which is a shame because the actors could have done so much more with their roles.The ""plot"" is a total waste of time and space. Who cares about ever being in danger, because no matter who you are around the world, Superman will save you! Whether it's Russian cosmonauts in space or conveniently-timed subway train problems, it seems that Superman can actually sense problems in advance! That's...really stupid. And apparently, Superman is all-knowing enough that he can just ask every single world leader to disarm their nuclear arsenals, and that they will comply WITHOUT HESITATION. I mean, it's not like some of those countries based their entire economies on the development of nuclear power, right? Right? There are some really terrible special effects shots in this film. It's plainly obvious to see, because there is footage recycled from the earlier entries in the series, bizarre effect shots (most notably, one instance where Superman flies through space with his cape flapping (???), and another instance in which he flies through a subway station, and the extras don't even bother turning to look at him!), some truly horrid green screen work (in the Fortress Of Solitude with the elders and the 1/3'rd size Superman flying through the subway!), and just plain strange visual effects (Superman repairing the Great Wall Of China with some random green beam that came out of his eyes!). Needless to say, this is not the shining hallmark of glory in the FX department.Character development? Ha! Forget it! Superman still acts like a bumbling fool, Lex Luthor is STILL a conniving clown, and it actually looks like Lois Lane has regressed in intelligence and thought from the first film. Then again, there is Nuclear Man, who barely even has a vocabulary, so I guess we should be thankful for that development.Bottom Line: It's terrible, no doubt about that.

The plot is fairly decent, with the exception of Nuclear Man. Good sweet Jesus, this has got to be one of the worst villains in comic book movie history, and by far the worst Superman villain. He does a hell of a job of eerily sucking the hope out of any scene he's in. Superman III, while bad as well, is better than this. This is easily the worst Superman movie (And one of the worst comic book/superhero movies as a whole), and I don't understand how people can say Superman Returns is worse than this, or even compare the two. The plot holes are impossible to ignore. For example, how in the hell is Lacy Warfield breathing in space? Sorry, but I can't suspend my disbelief that much.Getting back to the title of my review, it could have been worse. The performances could have been worse, the CGI could have looked even more fake, and the plot could have stunk even more. So keep that in mind.It's no surprise at all that it took 19 years for Superman to reappear on the big screen. 3/10.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
122,Baldach,A bungled script,3,4 June 2002,"Imagine the mid 80's: Superman is hot, Christopher Reed is considered a hot actor, the idea of promoting world peace by getting rid of all nuclear weapons seem plausabile; what could go wrong by making a movie combining all 3 ideas. PLENTY.  The script was bungled up from the start the idea that 1. Superman would listen to a grade school kid on his idea to remove all nuclear weapons and 2. The politicans would allow Superman to remove nuclear weapons, seems lame and unbelievable even from Marvel Comics. So next Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) creates a nuclear monster to fight Superman. I know for a fact that orginally there was supposed to be 2 nuclear monsters, one created from a nuclear bomb and the second created from the nuclear furance of the sun. But the producers decided to to use only the solar nuclear villian. So we have Superman fighting a villian dressed in red sequins and gold polyester. This is in addition to Superman's confusing relationship to Lois Lane (does she knows that Clark Kent wears the Big S?) Finally the sidekick for Lex Luthor (his nephew) looks and acts like a punk rock reject. So Overall the worse of modern Superman movies, but better than the movie Supergirl.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
123,k_g_barreto,Superman deserved more,3,8 December 2019,"The fourth and last movie of Reeve's era as Superman is unfortunely very bad, would be better if they ended in the last film, a trilogy good enough, even with the flawed third movie. Instead, we get this film, ending Superman for good, doing better than Doomsday, and only 30 years after it we get other Superman movie, to you see how much damage this film did it to the character. The plot is okay, but is the development that gets all wrong.First of all, Christopher, Kidder and Hackman tries hard, their perfomances are good enough, even with the bad writing, Lex Luthor character becomes a cliché, the biggest criminal mind of our generation, I get it, and he gains another dumb goon, basically the character goes to nowhere. Lois Lane is another character that suffers from bad writing, at least they could let her and Super be together, Superman interfered in the course of humanity already, he could be with her as well. It started as it ended, no changes in the status quo.The film started well, nuclear war, good moments, everythings okay, but after Nuclear Man everythings go downhill and would be a waste of time list all errors, believe me, it's a lot.

""Something wonderful""Pure cheese.Very strange that superman suddenley becomes a tad stronger than in the second installment of the series, where he struggles to stop a bus full of people thrown at him by Ursa and Nom under the guidance of General Zod. Then, in this final trash film, he is able with ease to move a planet. Highly unrealistic.The most amusing part of this flick for me is when Nuclear man is using Superman as a nail, knocking him into a planet. He takes a big swing and then gently taps Reeve.

I recently went out and purchased the first two movies and I enjoy the first three moves (Sure the third one isn't the best, but it's watchable, plus the whole computer thing was cool). However this movie isn't watchable. It's bad. Someone else has commented that we shouldn't expect something deep and meaningful and he's right, but we should expect something entertaining. There was nothing entertaining in this movie.
I caught this movie on WGN last weekend (It was Movies for guys who can do the MST3K thing on Movies) and I was at least expecting better special FX or Lex Luthor to be as good as he was in the first two movies, or Superman to be in shape, or a some-what intelligent villan in Nuclear Man and I expected the Fortress of Sollitude to look like it did in the first two.

129,MovieBuffMarine,End of an Era for both Reeve and Quality,1,20 October 2017,"It was nice seeing most of the original cast (from 1978) reprise their roles: Gene Hackman - Lex Luthor; Jackie Cooper - Perry White; Marc McClure - Jimmy Olsen; Margot Kidder - Lois Lane; and of course Christopher Reeve - Superman. This was to be their final outings in their respective roles in this iteration of Superman.Unfortunately, their presence alone was not enough to boost this movie both in story and at the box office. The Salkinds were no longer in charge. Instead, Golan-Globus and the Cannon Group were brought on to get this off the ground.The premise of this movie was a worthy one for our beloved hero: Superman wants to rid the world of nukes and his traditional arch-nemesis Lex Luthor had other plans to prevent that. Unfortunately, the Cannon Group and their writers couldn't make it interesting enough to draw audiences.While I enjoyed many of the flicks put on by the (now defunct) Cannon Group, it was apparent that superheroes and the Superman franchise were not their forte'. ""Low budget"" doesn't always equal low quality, but for this movie, unfortunately, the results were less-than-stellar.From what I gather, the Cannon Group was already in financial trouble when they took on the reins of the Superman series. This was a chance for them to start the road to recovery and make up for Superman III's dismal performance. They failed. Cannon continued their downward spiral and Superman IV did much worse than III.This was truly the end of the an era for Christopher Reeve's iteration of Superman, his fellow players who started in it and the original production company. While it was inevitable that the players for this iteration would no longer be playing those roles (as the years went by), it was sad to see their finale in these roles in this less- than-desirable chapter.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
130,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Awful,4,20 October 2018,"Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman return for the fourth and final Superman entry. Released in 1987 it's by no means a good film, it received universal hate upon release for cheap looking special effects, inconsistencies and plot holes. But over the years the film has gained cult status due to its cheesy dialogue, poor acting and far fetched plot making it enjoyable for all of the wrong reasons. It set the standard for bad superhero movies long before Batman & Robin was released.Superman/Clark Kent still works for The Daily Planet newspaper but it has gone bankrupt and tabloid tycoon Petty White takes over. His seductive daughter becomes the new editor and takes a liking to the bumbling clumsy Clark Kent. Lois Lane gets jealous and it becomes a pointless love triangle which (like everything else) leads nowhere.Anyway, Superman wants to rid the world of it's nuclear weapons and so every country (including Russia...) decide to help him gather all of these weapons so he can launch them into the sun. Meanwhile with the help of his annoying punk nephew, Lex Luther escapes prison and in the most far fetched plan you'll ever see, he creates his own super villain known as Nuclear Man, complete with spandex and an 80's mullet.Logic is thrown out of the window with this one, Nuclear Man takes a human being into outer space and she survives just fine.... We know it's about an alien who can fly etc but a human in space... It's like a 3 year old wrote the script. There isn't an ounce of respect for the previous films or the comics, Superman IV feels like a spoof. The first two films had their goofy moments and they were never 100% grounded in reality but at least they made sense. This one is just a jumbled mess and it's like they made it up as they went along.It would have been interesting to see Superman go up against these nuclear weapon obsessed countries. But instead they wanted to have multiple/unnecessary plot lines involving Lois Lane, Lex Luther and Nuclear Man all of which just ruin whatever potential the film ever had. There are a few tiny moments in the film which they could have further developed, but clearly the makers of this film were less concerned about quality and more concerned in milking this franchise for some easy money. Overall there is about 10 minutes of decent stuff in the movie, the rest is just a joke.The film was doomed from day one, with budget cuts and numerous other production troubles making the final product laughably awful. Reeve and Kidder both did good jobs but it eventually ruined their careers. Gene Hackman clearly had the most fun, but most likely because he received a big pay cheque for his return. There were also so many scenes left on the cutting room floor and it's very noticeable, they basically released an incomplete film.

He has the amazing ability to make us believe he is really Superman. I have heard that he was unhappy when he learned of the low production values, but he never shows it, he is truly a great professional actor. The rest of the regular cast turn in okay performances, and the newcomers are mixed. Mariel Hemingway is good, Sam Wanamaker is okay and I can't rate Mark Pillow because I haven't heard his voice, and his physical acting was mediocre.

The story is the most pathetic Superman story of all...in any form no less. Some scenes are totally unrealistic like when Nuclear Man had a woman hostage and went to outer space...you should see how unrealistic it is. Gene Hackman's back but his performance is nowhere near his past Superman performance...too bad because his presence went to waste with this blasted film. Christopher Reeve had his last Superman performance which is good because in this film he lost some of his Superman appeal and act and his age back then was related to that.Superman IV came out at a time when nuclear arms where a big issue (well...it still is today) and having Superman rid the world of them seemed like an interesting idea and a chance to show off Superman as a role model for the world. Well, seeing Superman gather those nukes and toss them at the sun was simply...very awkward and corny.It's just too bad that the Superman series of movies ended very badly with this blasted film.

133,Dock-Ock,"As it stands, less than brilliant.",4,25 May 2001,"There are often movies that come along in which you think, ""yes, it was bad and it could have been better"". The thing with Superman IV : The Quest For Peace, is that never a truer word has been said. It COULD be better, and iam sure that in its entirety with the previously unseen footage in the 134 minute cut of the movie, it would be good. As it is i must judge a patchwork movie. That is the main problem, the movie is badly operated on. Forget the special effects, they work nicely and arent as bad as people and critics will have you believe, we have seen worse. The direction by Sidney J Furie and presumably Christopher Reeve is at best good. The acting by the regulars and fun performances from John Cryer as Lex's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lacey Warfield [the love interest] are acceptable [certainly no worse than in any other sci=fi/action movie. And the plot, which has Superman fending off Nuclear arms from the worlds powers and defeating Luthors evil Nuclearman in the process is quite an exciting tale. The problem is that the movie is cut to ribbons. We see about fifteen minutes of what looks like Gene Hackmans best performance as Lex Luther, and Christopher Reeve's character comes over as vey wooden because we miss out alot of his characters development. As an 89 minute movie, Superman : The Quest For Peace is very lukewarm. As a 134minute movie, it looks to be alot better. Those of you who can get the extended version released, you know who you are.

Christopher Reeves is great as always, though again awkward as times. Especially as Clark Kent. I know Kent is supposed to be a clumsy mild mannered dork. But this film takes it too far. Being a slapstick comedy. I really don't know if the filmmakers were serious about this, but if they were, that's just sad. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" is not as bad as (almost) everyone says. It's not a series film. But I like the idea of bringing peace to earth. But this is not the film to showcase that.

The special effects are reused and B grade only, they have could have done a better job at them, considering the effects in the first Superman movie were the the best I've even seen in a movie at that point of time. You can still see wires holding actor's up, the blue screen work was crap and cheap and you can even see the background curtain when Superman is walking and fighting on the moon. (Superman 3 wasn't the best either but it still had decent effects)Its was only released as a 90 minute feature, maybe the 136 minute Director's Cut would have been a lot better. Considering the another three movies run easy over 2 hours. Also the movie has a few flaws in it, (The girl in space at the end, Superman taking in space) That's a few of them. If they didn't rush this movie, I think it would have been better then Superman 3. This one killed the series!

137,l-62911,A letter to Superman,1,18 December 2016,"Dear Superman Superman, Superman, how could you have sunk this low? Look mate, you had two brilliant films before. Superman, a huge achievement for all involved and the film that more or less kick started the superhero genre and Superman 2, a brilliant sequel that, while not a huge landmark like the first, can still stand on it's own in terms of story and acting.But then it started falling apart.When the Newmans were bought in to write Superman 3, that's when I started dreading the future of your franchise. They wanted to make your first movie campy and all that nonsense, but luckily they got kicked out. Sadly with Richard Donner truly out of the action, the Salkinds bought them in and Superman 3 became the film I was dreading it to be, a silly and stupid film with constant mugging from Richard Pryor and really terrible and dated gags.Then they tried to give Supergirl a film of her own and it even that wasn't a hit with the critics.Afterwards the Salkinds said ""Enough is enough"" and thus they sold you off to Cannon Films.That's when the cracks was really starting to show.Cannon are a rather cheap company and I knew a studio as cheap as Cannon certainly can't do justice to a superhero like you.And they tried.... they really did...and it was all for nothing.I really hate to say this to ya Superman, but man oh man was your fourth film a huge disaster all round. In fact even more than the third one.The plot sounded rather interesting, I mean you trying to stop a nuclear war from happening. That is a perfect concept for a fourth film... but then Nuclear Man walks in, and the only way from there is downhill.Reeeaaalllyyy downhill.Soon the film starts to really take a nose dive, everything from the dialogue to the incredibly cheesy and horrifically awful special effects start taking over.We're not taking this seriously, we're laughing.Laughing at the fact that the tornado scene is so laughably fake (fake as in it was all done on green screen.Laughing at the fact that the final battle between you and Nuclear Man is really just an excuse to show off incredibly cartoony looking effects.Laughing at the fact that Gene Hackman sounds unintentionally funny as Nuclear Man (played by a rather wooden looking Mark Pillow by the way).But at the same time, we're thinking... why... why are we being subjected to torture like this? Look I'll give some of the actors credit, it was nice to see Gene Hackman back as Lex Luthor (even though the horrible dialogue didn't do much)and Christopher Reeve was alright as of course you, Superman.But all of it still feels like it was done for nothing.It feels like it was just done to keep your franchise alive and made for a quick penny so that Cannon can make more cheesy films.Well the joke was on them... The film ended up bombing and it was panned by critics and fans alike.Yet I still feel disappointed at you Superman, I feel disappointed that instead of a film that would rub away all those horrid memories of Superman 3, we instead got a film that made that look like Citizen Kane.Honestly Superman, you're a super hero. And you should know better than to put your name on low budget guff like this? Well at least you got Man Of Steel afterwards though that still isn't saying much...Here's hoping someone actually does you justice in the near future...From RetroMagFan",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

However, poor business decisions by Cannon Films caused them to slash the budget to less than half of that. As a result, this film designed around an ""A"" budget was now being done on the cheap, which certainly did not help the story that Chris wanted to tell. What also didn't help was the deletion of 45 minutes of footage, which left severe plot holes. However two of those deleted scenes were completely finished and included in the international release of the film. Even though most of that footage was located in 2006, there was still a mystery concerning a print that was shown at a test screening in Southern California. I'm not sure if that print still exists, but I'm not qualified to go on that kind of scavenger hunt. But there was one thing that Superman said in the film that holds relevance even today.

If they could have portrayed Nuclear Man differently, including their use of Gene Hackman to voice him, if the plot holes were sufficiently plugged up, if the flying effects (at times) were not worse than the 50's television show and if the stupidity of having such things as Lacy Warfield (Mariel Hemingway) exist in outer-space without a space suit (and other such nonsense), it might not have been that bad. There were parts that I actually thought were decent. And there were good flying effects at times (although they were few and far between). I actually enjoyed seeing Gene Hackman portray lex Luthor again and he seemed like he was enjoying himself in spite of things. You know the story: Golan-Globus Productions were nearly bankrupt and had too many irons in the fire (at the time Golan and Globus had over 30 films in production, were cash-strapped and they gave Superman IV received no special consideration). They slashed the budget for this movie from $50 million (US) to $17 million, and it managed to gross a meager $15 million at the box office. It killed the franchise for nearly 20 years.

( we were in a hotel in the Ozarks. I wasn't hauling a TV with a long extension cord in the woods. Though trust me at 13 I would  have tried.) Being the typical comic nerd I felt compelled to watch it. All the time all sorts of people in girl scouts passed in and out of my hotel room  and made a loud remark how much Superman 4 stunk. I've stayed away from the rest of the Superman movies for many years. Now many years later I'm marrying a man who's a even bigger comic book nerd than myself at 13. So I've seen just about every superhero movie ever made. Yes out all the four superman movies this one does stink. The first half of the movie is corny, but it does have the general sweetness of the first two movies. It's good to see Margo Kidder back as Lois. The film is VERY 80's, but in a warped way it's adds to the cartoonish appeal. I enjoyed Lex Luther's nephew. He's wouldn't be out of place in the Bill and Ted movies. As silly as this sounds I like The whole plot of having the cute little kid wanting Superman to get rid of nuclear arms.It is silly, but likable. Then Nuclear Man shows up and the movie goes down the toilet. Well, okay it's not totally the character's fault. Chris Reeve's performance through out the movie you can tell he doesn't want to be there. The special effects are cheesy. No,no, calling the special effects cheesy would be a compliment. But Nuclear Man does deserve to take the blame for the awful second half. He looks like a wrestler reject, can't act, has one of the worst costumes I've ever seen. Face it when a male bad guy has a better nail job than most of the women you know and that's suppost to be scary. Well something's wrong with the movie.

But Superman is a fantasy, and perhaps you shouldn't attempt to bring reality into a fantasy. Maybe it would have worked with Richard Donner directing, and John Williams doing the score. Even Richard Lester would have made this movie a whole lot better. If they had spent some money on some decent effects that were available in 1987, then this movie would have been worth making. The effects are decades behind the level of the first, yet this one came out almost a decade later! Reeve does his best, but every other aspect of the movie is a complete failure (the original version was 134 minutes, proving so bad at test screenings they cut it to less than 90 minutes - big improvement!).

149,theojhyman,"So bad, yet so watchable !",6,3 April 2002,"Superman 1 was such a classic movie, and 2 was almost as great - Superman 3 is not a great Superman movie, but as a piece of '80s American comedy / spoof it succeeds and has some very memorable scenes (notably Chris Reeve as the evil Superman). But Part 4 is just an awful film overall with few redeeming qualities. Reeve's admirable storyline works well, and the double date scene with Superman & Clark is very entertaining (similar to the style of Superman III). But it's when Superman IV tries to get serious and exciting in its action sequences that it fails miserably and becomes a cheesey, ridiculous farce that only succeeds in showing how pointless it was to make the film on such a small budget. The story's not bad and if Donner was directing and you had 100 million dollars you could do it now and create a great adventure movie with some classic comedy scenes and some exciting action sequences. But anyway, it's too late. For all its failings, every time you see it, it's still fairly watchable, mainly because you're always expecting it to magically be better this time around. It's not as bad as everyone makes out and far more creative and original on a 16 million budget than what Batman and Robin did with 100 million!

Special effects were horrible as well as character development and plot line.

This is the only one of the 4 Superman movies where you can actually see his cables holding him up.the only thing worst than the special effects was the laughable script.

FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ORIGINAL PRESENTATION AND HAVE ONLY SEEN THE CLEANED-UP DVD, YOU AIN'T SEEN SQUAT!!! My comments will go towards the original theatrical/vhs release, the stuff before that attempt to clean it up on dvd.  That crap don't fly with me (no pun intended).  Where do I begin to complain?After watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that Superman's ability to propel himself at near limitless speeds (which look oddly slow in the bad bluescreen of this film) lies in his super-flatulence.  I say that because of the smell I noticed while watching it.  Where the hell did Superman get ""rebuild-the-great-wall-of-China-vision""?!?  When did he develop telekinetic ray beams (when he lowered the citizens held aloft by Nuclear...ugh....Man). When did Lois Lane become a crack whore?  When did Perry White die, only to be reanimated?  When did Jimmy Olsen turn 45?  When did Christopher Reeve lose all the muscle from his previous 3 movies, only to show up at 135 lbs soaking wet for this one?  When did human beings learn to talk in space? Why didn't Mariel Hemingway implode when Nuclear...ugh...Man dropped her in space?!? When did Gene Hackman's career go so wrong?  Why didn't Mariel burn up in earth's atmosphere when she was carried in and out of it?  How the hell could Superman push THE MOON (a plot device stolen from a cartoon episode of He-Man)?!?  Why would a clone of Christopher Reeve look like a gay 1980s aerobics instructor?  Why did they reference a first Nuclear...ugh...Man when those scenes were cut?  Why did Superman's cape's S-shield peel apart?  Why did the wires show at all times?  Why did Superman go flying in front of bad bluescreen with a crack-addicted skeleton?  Why were a large portion of the flying shots stock shots from Superman II or III?  When did Superman become a fascist dictator, spitting on the sovereignty of not only the United States, but the United Nations (the mecca of all you commies out there)?  When did Nuclear War have ANYTHING to do with Krypton's sun blowing up the planet?  There are more questions, mostly relating to continuity of the movies, but I don't wanna go into them. This movie made me ashamed to be a SuperFreak--even at 12 years of age (when I first saw it).  The wires have been cut out of the dvd, the color's been enhanced (the original blue screen shots looked 30 years old, even in 1987), and the blue screen's been digitally 'repaired.'

With a severed budget, uninspired dialogs, plot inconsistencies, dull special FX (especially when Superman is suspended by thin wires on the moon and when Lacy Warfield is in space without a breathing apparatus) and a ridiculous and laughably villain, how a Superman movie can be enjoyable ? As far as I'm concerned none of these problems can resolve its own.The film is so much different from the previous installments, and I felt a little alienated and lost while watching it. However I liked some moments, the best ones were with the campy Nuclear Man who shouted more than he spoke (he looks more like an extravagant wrestler than a clone of Superman) The final line was very prophetic while being ironic, and I'm glad that Superman returns is far more better than this monumental farce...Steve Baillargeon",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
163,ar87,"A flawed, though enjoyable movie",10,16 August 2001,"My rating - 3/5 stars CONTAINS SPOILERS Released in 1987, Superman did very poorly in the box office, because of bad reviews and because of some people's experiences with Superman III. John Williams replaced Ken Thorne - He and Alexander Courage made terrific music, possibly the greatest in the entire series, but unfortunately not on CD. Superman IV, a Cannon Group Inc./Golan-Globus Production, directed by Sidney J. Furie, and featuring the return of Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper, and Marc McClure, a story by Christopher Reeve, Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal -Christopher Reeve returned as the Man of Steel, on the condition that he could help write the story. He came up with a very sensitive theme - nuclear disarmament.After receiving a letter from a boy wishing that Superman would rid the world of nuclear weapons, Superman decides to put the plan into action, and with the approval of the world leaders, he hurles the missiles into space. Unknown to him is the fact that Lex Luthor planted a device on one of the missiles, with DNA from a strand of Superman's hair. A nuclear creation emerges from the sun, and makes his way to Earth. ""Nuclear Man"" proves to be Superman's biggest challenge yet. He destroys everything in reach to ""have fun,"" and gives Superman a nuclear beating. Although Superman proves to be a better fighter, Superman is scratched on the back of his neck by Nuclearman's ""nuclear nails."" Bleeding for the first time in his life (with his powers) Superman becomes ""sick"" and disappears. He uses the green crystal for the second time (not too original) which returns his powers to him. Suddenly, we see a scene with Nuclearman destroying everything in sight, until Superman will tell him where Lacy Warfield (new publisher of the Daily Planet) is hidden. The scene basically pops out of nowhere, and leaves you staring at the screen with a blank look on your face. Superman pretends that Lacy is in an elevator, shuts the lights off, and hurls it into the moon. Superman forgets to do a double check to see if any cracks are in the elevator, and is attacked by a regenerated Nuclearman. Superman is pummeled into the ground (literally), while Nuclearman flies back to Earth. Nuclearman grabs Lacy, and flies up to space, his reasons unknown. He's a blond, buff, moron - What did you expect? Superman moves the moon (possibly causing tidal waves in the process) to cover up the sun. Nuclearman ""shuts down,"" and Lacy is left struggling to hang on to him, so she doesn't ""fall,"" then Superman comes out of nowhere and brings her back. He takes Nuclearman, and throws him into a nuclear reactor. One would think that this would cause a power surge, but every light in the city turns on, blinding everyone in sight, even though I'm sure many of the buildings didn't have their light switches on.The budget was cut in half, leaving the special effects group helplessly reusing effects. One of these reused effects seems like a cutout of Superman being pushed towards the camera on a stick (great way of describing it, DVDfile).The only thing that saves this film is a great story (the nuclear disarmament idea, DEFINITELY not Nuclearman) and some great performances, as usual, by Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman. Margot Kidder appears as well, but doesn't get a whole lot of screen time.The old wise tale is that there was a screening of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace in Orange County, CA. The viewers didn't like it, so they cut the supposedly 134 minute movie down to a measly 90 minutes. The TV version has 2 extra minutes of footage. It's possible that the extended cut is still out there - many fans have a theory that it was thrown in the fire.

The movie was way too short, it feels very hasty, especially when you compare it to the first two films. I've seen the deleted scenes and i really have to say it's a good thing they were left out. Nuclear Man #1 is horrible. He's not menacing or scary, he looks stupid. Like a failed incarnation of some silly Frankenstein film.One of the biggest mistakes i have ever seen in a movie is one made in this film. Nuclear man 2 takes Lacy (a human with no superpowers whatsoever) into space. She doesn't freeze, hell she even breathes!! I don't know what the director was thinking.. This is careless film-making.But let's not just focus on the negative side. The movie also has a few good things. The original cast returned (Margot Kidder as Lois, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Gene Hackman once again as Lex Luthor and of course, our hero, Christopher Reeve returning as Superman).

Before I say anything good, I'm gonna start with the bad starting with the special effects for the fourth installment of this series which was very poor. When Christopher Reeve lands on the moon you can see the wires suspending him as well as in other scenes, the editing is cheap and many shots you can tell are the same or just look digitized. Also lets not forget when Mariel Hemingway is brought into space she dosen't die. Ya it's bad quality and is definitely the poorest film of the 4. But I have to say,the story wasn't that bad though a bit corny. Superman clearing the world of nuclear weapons and Lex Luthor creating a being named Nuclear Man to kill the Man of Steel. The concept of Nuclear Man was pretty cool but he could have been portrayed a lot better instead of....well an idiot, especially since he was created from Superman's DNA. It was entertaining when Superman and him duke it out across the world with Superman repairing the world as Nuclear Man destroys it (ignoring the fact that it was daytime in America, China and Russia at the same time another error thanks to the poor production) and of course the battle on the moon. It was a good storyline turned into a not so good movie. We all know it could have been much much better but thanks to the cheap production of Golan/Globus this is all we got.

Instead I will focus on the few good aspects of the movie. Chris Reeve is once again great in being superman and Gene Hackman is an absolute joy to watch as the menacing Luthor with only one thing on his mind ""Destroy superman"". The references to the first two movies e.g.flying sequence with Lois Lane and the well known score remind us of why they were so successful.I agree with the nonsensical space sequence but not so much with superman moving the moon. It's a comic book movie after all and in the first film he managed to get the earth out of orbit! You know the whole idea of a man flying and being invincible is quite impossible so why don't you pick on that too? In superman's world anything can happen.However what is painful for me personally is Warner Bros not being bothered to refurbish superman 4 just like Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy(added better sound, new scenes e.g. Hayden Christensen at the end of the return of the Jedi). They could use modern technology and hide the visible wires and improve the flying sequences. I am sure it won't be expensive. Plus why not even restore the 45 minutes of deleted footage? Dick Donner did so in the first film and also later this year a new restored cut of superman 2 is coming out with all the deleted Donner footage.

Alas, Christopher Reeve showed no such wisdom, and as good as he is playing Superman, the story he co-wrote for TQFP is abysmal.  The ""Superman loses/regains powers"" and ""Superman tries to convince Lois that he & Clark are different people"" set pieces are recycled from Superman II, where they were both done much better.  Nuclear Man seems to have been invented just so Supes has someone to fight, and the ""Lois flying"" scene also seems put in for its own sake.What's the worst thing?  The aforementioned crystal in this installment is introduced in the first 10 minutes of the film, and it's an obvious deux ex machina to pull Supes out of a jam later on.  Granted, the one in II is also a deux ex machina, but it's nowhere near as blatant: when Kal-El lost his powers in that episode, you had no idea how he would get them back.  In TQFP, you can see it coming from a mile away.P.S.

174,jo007r,Sad note for the Man of Steel to go out on...,5,21 August 2000,"The final adventure of Superman is by far his worst.  Granted Superman III isn't much better, but at least it was not as contrived as this one. 
First of all, let's look at the good parts of this movie, it is a short list.  Christopher Reeve came up with an excellent story for this film and it reflected the times that the world was facing.  Riding the world of nuclear weapons was a good start, a nice foundation to build on; unfortunately there was not enough money to finish the film and it was released unfinished.  The other nice things about this film are the return of Lex Luthor,and the return to seriousness in the film series.  One can only wonder how this movie would have turned out had all the necessary funding been there. 
The special effects are just plain horrible, and the audience winces as Superman makes his 'dramatic entrance' by saving a space capsule from spinning into the Earth's atmosphere and rescuing a man falling into space. Everytime Reeve is in flight, the animated Superman is obvious to everyone, and it is sad to see this; for the audience no longer believes a man can fly, but that a cartoon can instead.  So many scenes are deleted from this movie that it is confusing to understand just how certain key elements of the film are executed, or worse yet, why!The only scene which holds interest for a little while is the climatic battle between Superman and Nuclear Man, at best the scene gets a mediocre. 
So far this has been the final entry of the Superman series, and although the film is exceptionally weak.  Christopher Reeve once again sparkles as the Man of Steel.  He always gave an excellent performance as Superman even when the movies where sub-par, and that speaks plenty. 
At least the ending to this movie is done well with Superman flying out of the Earth and smiling at us as he flies off into space, protecting the world; that alone will always inspire some kind of hope to people.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Well I am here to say that this really isn't fair.As with so many things, it's all a matter of context – yes, alongside a modern equivalent superhero sequel, e.g. The Dark Knight or any of the X-Men follow-ups, it's pretty dire. But then alongside a contemporary equivalent – say, Highlander II: The Quickening or Ghostbusters 2 – it's almost sublime! (But then compared to Highlander II, nuclear war sounds like a pleasant diversion.)Anyway, I am prepared to say that this is not even the worst Superman film! It's worthy of re-evaluation and it's genuinely worth seeing as part of the series.Firstly, it's VERY 1980s when you watch it now. Big-hair-tastic and shoulder-pad-mungous. But this is comparable to any other film from that era, such as Robocop or Working Girl. And yes, infamously there are some extremely dodgy effects in the mix – but some of them are actually very good. This odd contrast is not so different from the previous films in the series, especially the first from 1978. And remember that Ghostbusters – released the previous year and winning an Oscar for its effects, no less – has some risible shots when you look at it now.The real problem with Superman IV is that it's clearly been compromised in the making, ultimately put together without all the footage the director had planned to shoot. The infamous budget slashing by the studio is obvious in various scenes. While, jarringly, elsewhere you can see the money up on screen – the result being an uneven whole that's sadly less than the sum of its parts.I shall have to check out the deleted scenes some time to see what potential was there. But as it is, there are so many plus points trying to save this film:Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor again, with lots of good lines and villainous charm. he was shamefully wasted in Superman II, as was Kevin Spacey in this role in the turgid and unengaging Superman Returns. Hijacking the airwaves to lure Superman, Luthor signs off with V-for-victory signs and an ironic ""Peace!"" and I love the subsequent scene where he has his say/exercises his ego before our endlessly patient hero, constantly on the move and fixing himself a drink of champagne to toast the demise of his arch-enemy. (It's clear, too, that the film-makers decided to try to top his wonderful subterranean lair from the original film by having his new hideout a big Art Deco set for the top of Metropolis' equivalent of the Empire State Building.)The rest of the returning cast all do a solid job and, of course, Christopher Reeve is excellent. As the clutzy Clark Kent, he mistimes his aerobics (so 80s again!) but slyly gets back at a bully, bumbles around the capable Margot Kidder's Lois Lane and compliments his new love interest on her dress – badly and only at Lois' prompting. And then, as the earnest Superman, wrestling with his conscience and making then-oh-so-valid points about the Cold War arms race and human frailties, he gives the film a weighty centre. A scene at the now deserted Kent farm is touching and there is even the revelation that, without his parents, he now seems to be in the habit of revealing his identity to Lois for some love and advice, then mind-wiping her (again) with a super-snog! She is not, it is strongly suggested, entirely unaware of this arrangement...Lastly, Sidney J Furie is a very capable director and his work shines in certain scenes... while elsewhere you are left musing sadly on what might (should) have been. The double date is superbly handled – for example, there's a lovely shot where Clark quick-changes into Superman through a car parked outside revolving doors. And dare I say that the sequences where the 'Nuclear Man' goes on the rampage, around the world and then on the streets of Metropolis, are actually better handled, with more sense of scale and jeopardy than the three Kryptonian villains' not dissimilar activities in Superman II. Then there is the careful way Superman's famed all-American persona is, in this film (only, out of the five), balanced against a sense of him actually being an international figure, fluent in all languages and looking at the planet and the human race as one whole. In the opening scene we are presented with some Soviet cosmonauts who are shown to be 'just like you and me', neatly setting up the film's entire premise – which is eventually tied up with even the defeated Luthor asking an Eisenhower-quoting Superman if the Earth will be vapourised in WWIII and being told that, as always, the planet is ""on the brink with good fighting evil"".So in conclusion: It's nowhere near as good as the original, epic Superman, nor does it work with anything like the brio of Superman III, which is pure entertainment in my book. But it scores over Superman II, which for me feels like it was too old-fashioned even upon its initial release and seems even more compromised in its mix of what works and what jars. While in last place I am afraid I must put the disappointingly wet and unimaginative Superman Returns.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

I still have my gripes, especially with a new overly comical and shallow villain and poor recreations of iconic Superman moments (Lois' First Flight & Memory Erase). If this film tried to be less like its predecessors and have a more interesting and iconic Superman villain, I think it would have been a far more beloved addition to the franchise.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

The special effects are horrible, the plot sucks, and at times this film makes absolutely no sense. For example, towards the end there is a scene where Nuclear Man (?) takes a woman in to outer space, and she lives (!) Yet, at the beginning you see astronauts in space suits walking around on the moon. They needed space suits to survive, so why didn't the girl? During one of the ridiculous fight scenes in space, you can actually see that the characters are standing on a flat surface, and the space backdrop has been superimposed.

179,A_Random_Guy_22,"Super... aw, forget it!",2,5 October 2008,"Superman is my all-time favourite film and I immensely love Superman II. Superman III had its faults, but it was still enjoyable up to some extent. Unfortunately, this isn't the case with the fourth (and what we thought was the final) in the Superman series. First off, the ""special"" effects. One word: FAKE! We have Warner Bros. to thank for that for selling the rights to Cannon Films who, instead of using the $40 million Warner Bros. gave them to produce the film, used only $17 million and used the rest of the money on their other projects. Next up we have (drumroll)... the numerous plot holes e.g. people being able to breathe in space without space suits. Did I miss something here? Thirdly, the editing. Oh my, that poor, poor editing. The cuts were so noticeable, I was wondering if I was watching a Daytime TV edit of a Horror movie. And finally, the acting. Wow. It was like something out of a school play (and a bad one at that). But, I suppose the actors did the best they could with the (truly atrocious) script.Superman IV doesn't even classify as a ""so bad, it's good"" movie. At least not when you compare it to the highly superior first two.Some people have said that this movie is worse than Batman & Robin. Trust me, it is not. Not even close. However, both Superman IV and Batman & Robin are the worst of their series.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
180,Avatar-7,Worst movie ever...,1,10 July 2003,"What can I say about this total piece of trash? I have no idea how it has garnered 3.3 stars. This movie was meant to be serious, and to deliver a serious message. It was not inteneded to be campy. That's why it's so bad. The acting is bad, the writing is childish, the dialog is painful, the special effects aren't so special, even the techno babble is ridiculous. I've stepped in deeper puddles. I consider myself less of a person for having seen this movie. I cannot imagine what a fine actor like Gene Hackman must have been thinking when he associated himself with this rubbish.

When you're about three or four, you think anything done by Superman is great because you never know what good taste is. Looking at this film more recently, I tried to look past the fact the film was a flop. Now that I've seen it as a young man, I know why it sucked. It's not just that the story was weak but the execution needed a drastic overhaul. It's too bad that the film studio didn't put more money into the special effects. I'm not going to mention what I mean by that for legal reason from this site so you'll just have to watch the film and see what I'm talking about.

182,metrik7,"Calling it ""bad"" insults things that are actually bad.",1,10 December 2004,"Sometimes sequels are made for the sake of making money (see ""Rush Hour 2"").Sometimes sequels are made for the sake of continuing a worthy story (see ""Lord of the Rings""). And sometimes, sequels are made for no discernible reason. Such is the case with ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."" So much talent is wasted here. Jon Cryer. Mariel Hemingway. Sam Wanamaker. Even Jackie Cooper's Perry White is simply a caricature of a caricature. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane apparently had all of her brain cells removed by Superman's kiss at the end of Superman II. The movie is garbled.The plot is unclear. The characters lack motivation. And I picked all of this up at age 13. I remember riding home from the theater, having seen Superman IV while my parents saw something else. And boy, did I wish I'd gone with them once the movie was over, and I told them so.One last note: a lot of users have bashed the character of Nuclear Man. They were right to do so; he's an awful character with an awful haircut (Crowded House called: they want their bassist's hair back!). But even though the character was terrible, Mark Pillow's portrayal of him was somehow even worse. If you look up Mark Pillow on the IMDb, you'll notice that he has had a total of two other roles.

183,mjurado,Horrible - A disservice to so many years of comic genious,1,30 May 2002,"Horrid.This movie is completely vile in every way. Basically, the plot (as it were) is a preachy, left-wing rant about nuclear disarmament that features Superman swooping in, in dictatorly fashion, to disarm the whole world unilaterally.  There are many, many stupid aspects of this movie that don't even deserve my regurgitation. For example: -since Supe can erase Lois' memory with a kiss - why doesn't he just kiss Lex Luthor, the president (clearly meant to bash the president of the time) and everyone else causing all this great evil? -if letter-writing little kids are so smart, why aren't they running the country? -why does superman's cape flap around in space? -how could the blue-screen scenes in any one movie suck so bad? -why should we be scared of such an unintelligent and oafishly portrayed Lex Luthor? -Does Superman have DNA? He's an alien! -Why does the flying with Lois scene seem to last for half an hour? -Who the hell wrote this script, anyway?Stay away. Stay far, far away. This is not a funny bad movie, it's unwatchable. A preachy, contrived, eliteist rant from a long defunct political ideology.I rate it 0 out of 5 stars, and subtract 1 star from Superman 3 to make up for this abomination's damage to the series.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
184,AndrewKnevett,Superman falls on his Kryptonite sword,1,24 March 2010,"I have avoided Superman IV: The Quest For Peace for 20 odd years due to the critical reviews it received following its release. It's only because it came with a Superman collection on DVD I plucked up the courage and decided to give a go.Fortunately my expectations were already low so I wasn't going to be disappointed, and maybe, just maybe, I might enjoy it and be on here saying ""What's the problem, people? It's not THAT bad"". Oh but alas it is; it's horrendous and watching it for the full duration was painful. And no, not even the usually reliable Gene Hackman could save it.The acting, direction, editing, script and special effects are all poor. There are plot holes the size of craters and bloopers including clearly visible wires suspending Superman as he lands on the moon near the end and a human being alive and breathing outside the earth's atmosphere (the actress in question showing no sign of shock or surprise as if this is a daily occurrence!). Other things of note, Superman failing to arrest/grab Lex Luthor for being an escaped convict; a completely unbelievable and pointless love interest sub plot involving a very bored looking Clark Kent and Lacy Warfield; And probably the worst villain ever conceived in Nuclear Man.But what I dislike the most is the message/premise of this film which is that Superman has decided ""to make the world a safer place"" by destroying all nuclear weapons. Forgive me for asking, as noble act as you may think this is, but did Superman consult the elected leaders of the world about this? We, in the civilised world, possess nuclear weapons to protect our people from the bad despots and dictators of the world. How can it be a good thing but leaving the civilised world defenseless (even in a world where there's Superman)? In summary I hated this film, even die hard Superman fans will hate it. Those who wear Parker jackets laden with CND badges will love it.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
185,repo_jake-1,Pillow Goodness,3,4 July 2005,"Superman 4 the quest for peace?? OK the premise had potential - Superman saving the world for Nuclear disaster. If anyone who has read the Graphic Novel 'The Dark Knight Returns', will know that Superman does indeed save the world from nuclear destruction as Batman faces off finally against Joker. So Superman doing this and an escaped Lex Luther trying to make money from re arming the world has merit.But it is completely wrong! Lex Luther suddenly develops a unique talent for genetic engineering to grow a man from the sun. The films most funny point is its endless use of the same shot of Christopher Reeve superimposed flying towards the screen. When you monitor it, you see how often it comes up you start yelling ""use another shot""!The funniest thing is Nuclear man played by the legendary Mark Pillow! He flies, he growls, he has retractable finger nails and is dubbed with Gene Hackmans voice! He looks like he is wearing a black nappy with bondage gear on! I think the growling is dubbed too. He is supposed to be as hot as the sun (floor melts under him) but when he kidnaps Mariel Hemmingway she doesn't melt in his arms or die from being flown through deep space by Pillow! This was just stupid, she looks down at the Earth from the Moon! What the hell????The whole film is just stupid, Hackman and Reeve just look bored and thinking of the money they will make! The flying scenes just look pathetic as seen when Superman takes Lois flying! Its soooo bad! The only saving grace is when Superman is clearing up the destruction left behind by Nuclear Man, not bad like the Mount Vesuvius eruption! Mark Pillow should join the legendary Dan 'The Man' Haggerty as he is so bad he is good! Superman Returns should be a return to form!",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
186,snottyscotty150,Superman IV....hmm...,10,28 April 2007,"I maybe in the small percentage here but I thought this movie was a good solid comic book film. OK your probably thinking I'm mental for liking a film thats got a review of 3.3...but bear with it as I will explain why I like it.OK first off when I was younger I watched a film that had superman in it and a superman in a black costume....but I could never remember what superman it was, I knew it wasn't the first one or the third because I had them on video, so it was bound to be the second.When superman two was on sky movies I watched it and to my shock it didn't have that bit of cinema and action that I remembered watching as a child. After countless google searches I finally found out there was a superman four so quickly got hold of a copy and watched it...this is where the review begins.To begin with it has almost all the original cast back for the final film of the series, which is nice on its own, the opening sequence is (I will admit) abit poor compared to the previous films but when you hear the music you know your watching a superman film. Anyway the film goes on and superman starts to deal with issues that are important, a child writes to him and asks him to take all the nuclear weapons off earth and destroy them, to begin with superman isn't too sure on the idea. Anyway in the end he does destroy them, mean while Lex Luthor steals one of superman's hairs from a museum and uses it to create Nuclear Man, basically an evil superman...well it's almost exactly like superman except hes blonde and needs the sun to get energy on a more extreme level than superman.Still the movie has some great action sequences and fits in well to the other superman films, though you do have to take this for what it is ""a comic book movie"" it is good at what it is, you have to watch it and forget everything you where ever taught or believe...OK some of the stuff like the fight on the moon is abit extreme but it's a SUPERman movie. I can only suggest you watch this movie but just don't take it seriously it is a nice movie to watch and it is memorable which I hope is the message you got from the beginning of this review.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

190,criddic2,Unfortunate End to an Entertaining Series,3,13 November 2001,"Many people have written about this movie and how bad it is.  Well, it is bad.  Can't deny it.  Some of the effects are among the worst ever displayed in a major motion picture.  The script is chopped up so bad that some scenes wind up being incoherent.  One saving grace is the sincerity of the performances.  Christopher Reeve is still a believable Superman/Clark Kent, while Gene Hackman makes a pleasing return to the series as Lex Luthor.  It should either have just dealt with nuclear arms or the solar powered villain, not both.  The zany subplot with Mariel Hemingway falling for Clark is mildly amusing.I have heard/read a great deal concerning cut scenes and a grossly cut budget.  Why did they do that to Superman? Didn't the producers know that fans wanted to see a worthy movie, not a cheap imitation?The real problem was that the Salkinds left after #3, leaving the filmmakers with cheap producers, and not choosing a better director than Sydney J. Furie.At least #3 had entertaining elements, even if it did throw out the Lois Lane character and any trace of the previous two movies.  I liked the sweetness of the Smallville scenes and the humor provided by Richard Pryor; I even liked some of the special effects sequences.  But #4 is virtually a child's wind-up toy.  Reeve had good intentions with his input as co-writer and 2nd unit director, I'm sure.  He remains true to character.It should have been better.  * *",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
191,lee-p-sherman,Not *That* Bad,5,8 April 2010,"I saw this movie when I was about 11 and liked it. Later I learned of all the scorn heaped upon it, and figured it was one of those shabby films that only seems entertaining when you're not old enough to scrutinize it in the least (e.g. the ""Ninja Turtles"" live-action movies). But I rented it today for curiosity's sake, and I still like it. I honestly don't understand why it's gone down in history as one of the worst films ever made. If any of them deserve scorn, it's ""Superman III."" But that's a different review for a different day.I'm not going to claim this is a great film. It does have problems. Except for a few nicely-constructed models (particularly the Russian space station), the special effects are bargain basement. It doesn't have as many nice character moments as the first movies or ""Superman Returns."" The plot doesn't flow naturally. The green crystal is an unsatisfying Deus ex machina (and really confusing in light of the first movie, although I think we're supposed to believe this is a separate crystal piece of the spaceship that we didn't see before – maybe they should've made it purple to avoid confusion). A number of things come up only to be dropped. And, perhaps most unfortunately, the real issues of the Cold War and nuclear disarmament aren't fully explored. But ""Superman IV"" is not a bad piece of entertainment, and it's refreshing to see a movie that depicts the world as a place where people can rise above all the hatred and evil and forge a better future.I could criticize this movie for being scientific nonsense, but the ""Superman"" movies have always been closer to fantasy than science fiction, and this isn't really any worse than the others. We have Superman talking in the vacuum of space and being heard by astronauts, but that happened in ""II"" with Ursa. And a lot has been made about how he telekinetically moves things in this movie by looking at them, but Zod did the same thing in ""II"" and that didn't seem to bother anyone. Him ringing the doorbell from the balcony to appear as Clark Kent once Lois turns her head is stretching credibility, and the part where Lacy is taken into space is stupid, but little things like that aren't what ruin a film in a series where heavy suspension of disbelief is par for the course. Lastly, none of the ""plot holes"" are that serious, and most of them are just a byproduct of the (admittedly clumsy) editing job done to improve the film's pacing and remove a braindead subplot.Now I'll focus on the positive things. The part where Clark playfully reveals himself as Superman to Lois, consults her for advice, then reinstates the mental block, is great. It was pretty much the only thing I remembered from watching the movie as a kid, and there's a reason. It's beautiful, funny, and provides insight into the Man of Steel's mind. The subplot with Lacy and her father is good for some laughs. The humor and drama are in a ratio that I consider good, as in ""Superman Returns"" and the Donner Cut of ""Superman II."" Probably the biggest highlight is Lex Luthor. He may have natural hair for no apparent reason, but he's the same magnificent bastard he was in the two ""Superman"" films I love. The lines written for him and Gene Hackman's performance are both top notch. And, while I'm on the subject, Christopher Reeve does a great job too, although there isn't a whole lot to his role in this film (excepting the scene described above). On the minus side, Margot Kidder phones it in, and the rest of the supporting cast is so-so. Jon Cryer is wasted as Lex Luthor's teenage nephew.There is one thing that really annoys me about ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" mainly because it baffles the hell out of me. Holograms of Kryptonian elders appear to Kal-El in the Fortress of Solitude, and none of them are the same elders who appeared in the first two movies. Makes sense, couldn't get the actors, y'know. Except John Hollis, who played one of the Kryptonian elders in those movies, is in this movie in a totally different role (Soviet general). I mean, seriously, what's up with that? The bottom line: This isn't a bad movie. I don't know if I'd recommend buying it, but you should rent it if you like ""Superman,"" or if you want to show the kids something fun that isn't violent or obscene. It's a pleasant, optimistic, fairly engaging action-fantasy story, and it has lots to offer those who look to the '80s with nostalgia. And be sure to watch the deleted scenes, because one is better than anything in the feature. It's a clever bit of political commentary that depicts the Cold War arms race as an '80s arcade game, with all the quarters going to Lex Luthor and his fellow war profiteers.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

We have three ""Superman saves Lois Lane"" scenes, in the first film we have the helicopter scene which was edge of your seat suspense! and an awesome special effects scene in the pre-CGI era. The Eiffel tower scene in Superman II, almost as awesome! another edge of your seat suspensor, then we come to Superman IV, the Subway train scene, which I almost fell asleep through! come on Sydney! what were you thinking? If Richard Donner had made this film, it would have soared! The subway scene could have been suspenseful even on the low budget the crew was given to work with! So, you ask, why are you giving this film four out of ten stars? Because of the story, the performances of Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and the over all fact that I was glad to see another Superman Movie! The ideas that went into this movie were great! Superman tries to save humanity from itself! Perry White looses the Daily Planet to a competitor! Superman fights a villain created from his own DNA! If the filmmakers had anywhere near the passion for this material that went into the first two films then it would have been a very entertaining Superman movie! and it may have been the first Superman film to break 200 Million at the Box Office! But, it was not to be! I was hoping that there would be five Christopher Reeve Superman films and this film, sealed that fate! I have seen the new Brandon Routh Superman and I feel that the new filmmakers have a passion for the material, but the films story is weak! The special effects were top-notch and the cast is great!

196,RobTheConqueror,"Hot, nuclear garbage",1,16 January 2016,"It's interesting how the Superman and Batman film series followed a similar pattern. Both began with two great movies that changed the genre in different ways, both had a third installment with a different director which ended up having its moments but ultimately being a silly, hollow mess and both ending with a car crash of a fourth installment which ruined the credibility of the superhero genre.Yes, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is the 'Batman and Robin' of the Superman film series, except I can at least laugh at how bad that was. Superman IV is just....I'm not sure what I feel while watching it. Anger? No. It's too silly for that. At the end of the day, it's just a completely inept movie on the same level as Jaws: The Revenge, and that's a fitting comparison as both are some of the worst movies of all time.The visual effects are staggeringly awful, with terrible green screen shots and the same shot of Superman flying towards the camera being used over and over and over again, there are dozens of plot holes (the UN are just.....OK with Superman disarming all their nuclear weapons? The Justice League animated show, a show far more intelligent than this by the way, handled that better), there are dozens of subplots that go nowhere like the integrity of the Daily Planets new owner of the girl who fancies Clark, Lois does nothing of note despite her expanded role except one lazy scene where they redo the plot of Superman II (with the same end result) in about two minutes (f**k this movie), Nuclear Man is the worst villain ever put on screen as not only does he look unconvincing but sounds it too, with his voice by Hackman (also playing Lex Luthor again in this movie) being a dodgy match for the actor and the awful, awful dialogue. The movies problems are literally endless, and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't such an assault on the eyes as well as the brain.This is not only one of the worst comic book movies ever made, it's one of the worst movies ever made.

The Golan/Goblus production isn't competent in anyway.2: The plot could be better, much better...The nuclear Man, Superman talking in space after to save astronauts, Lacy Warfield in space, the Moon's scenes and Luthor's escape of jail are some examples of the mistakes in the plot, but some scenes like the Superman speech is OK.The film's intention is really good, but intention is never enough.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Well, I was around when this atrocity came along and everyone knew it was going to stink. Instead of taking something(plot/storyline) from the comic books (there were many to pick from this is Superman for heaven's sake!) Christopher Reeve did not want to make a fourth movie. I can see his point, it had been awhile since part 3, and that showed how tired the series had become. I will admit I do not know how it ever got off track, 1 was great and 2 was better! But I digress, anyhow, Reeve would not come back, until Warners gave him a barrel of cash (Superman was the only thing he did that would pay anyway) and he had to have total control over the storyline. Yeah, Chris Reeve in charge of the story! Talk about handing the keys to the asylum over to the patients! Under what circumstance would Reeve do the story? Only if it had an anti-nuke story line. He was a big no-nuke guy at the time. So there. Wondering why part 4 stank? Reeve and his silly story line, and also no Ilya Salkind to produce. He screwed up on part 3 a bit, but he would never have made a Superman film as bad as this. Stink-ola!",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

I have to say Superman: The Movie is as great now as it was then, nearly brought tears to my eyes and made me nostalgic for the good old days.Then there was Superman II (the Lester version). I remember liking it as a child, but as an adult I scratched my head and wondered exactly what had gone wrong. The... what is the word? The verisimilitude was gone along with the thrill. And was that recycled footage at the end? I wanted for it it to be the same or better than the first one. It wasn't.Then there was Superman III. Lester in all his glory. All I can say is: skiing down the side of a skyscraper? Superman can get drunk? You can make oil go back into an oil rig like that? And was that recycled footage at the end? Are you kidding me?But Superman IV. Dear God, Superman IV. Well, that is an atrocity of epic proportions. At its heart, somewhere deep, deep down (very deep) it had a somewhat good concept. Superman rids the world of nuclear weapons. Apparently, the whole ""it is forbidden for you to interfere with their destiny"" is right out the window. Superman says ""hand 'em over"" and the world goes ""no problem"". Then Lex Luthor, in his brilliance, comes up with an idea no one else would have in the whole world. He's going to get better than nuclear weapons. In his genius he has come up with a nuclear man. Guess what the ""greatest criminal mind of all time"" comes up with for a name? Nuclear Man! And Nuclear Man has bizarre abilities the script doesn't have time to explain like electric fire eyes that sparkle and... I guess that's all. Plus, even though he is made up of Superman's DNA, he has Lex Luthor's voice (Lex must have used his ""criminal intellect"" to do that). Also he can fly and break stuff and, for no apparent reason, he likes Clark Kent's love interest (?). Perhaps his reason is that she can go into space and not die! Seriously, man. Then there's the mysterious scratch that Nuclear Man gives Superman, which makes him have the flu. To which he reacts like a complete wimp. This movie also reveals the secret to Superman's flying: wires! The special effects people must have been saying, ""Slash my budget, will you? Well, I'll kill the Superman franchise good, that'll learn you to mess with me."" And kill it they did because it took nineteen years for Superman to Return.

The effects are poor, the sets are cheap, the editing is choppy and the script doesn't make much sense. There is, however, some good stuff within this 1987 sequel that makes it better than other bad sequels. The Alexander Courage score is wonderful, dramatic and sweeping and really lifts the movie during the action sequences. Mariel Hemingway's character, the lovely Lacy Warfield is a fresh character that adds much to the production. She's very pretty too. Gene Hackman makes a welcome return as the camp Lex Luthor and he has some funny moments with his nephew, Lenny Luthor. The story has some good themes and messages but they seem to get lost within the incoherent nature of the structure.

But, when I watched reviews of it, I didn't understand it. Until I did research on the film. Overtime, I lost interest in the film. Now, I think this movie isn't good.

208,danmankp37,Tragic End To The Reeve Series of Films,5,1 September 2008,"Superman 4 was intended to be a return to the High quality of the first 2 Reeve Superman films. Hopefully erasing the bad taste that Superman 3 left in the fans mouth. What resulted was a bad fun-house of special effects, a chopped up poorly edited movie, with a plot that went nowhere and fell flat on it's face. The rights to Superman were sold to the now non-existent, Cannon studio by Alexander and Ilya Salkind, (Producers of Superman 1-3) Chris Reeve after the disappointment of Superman 3, initially swore off reprising the role of Superman but after a sweet deal including story input was offered to him by Cannon, he signed on for the 4th. Reeve's idea was to construct a story where Superman felt obligated to try and rid the world of Nuclear Weapons and bring about peace."" Not a bad concept but the screenplay that was written did little to flush out the details in an engaging fashion. Superman 4 centers around the return of Lex Luthor, who is broken out of prison by his incredibly annoying and less than bright, nephew Lenny. Once escaped he plans on ridding the world of Superman by creating a Supervillain, partially from Superman's DNA and once Superman is gone, he'll become something of a war profiteer. The result of this Supervillain is the corny and terribly conceived Nuclear Man. A being who looks like he stepped out of a bad 70's Disco movie, with his long teased blonde hair, big muscles and hokey costume. So Superman must defeat Nucler Man, foil Lex and save the day while preserving peace. The biggest problem with Superman 4 is how cheaply it was made. Cannon ran out of money during pre-production thanks to other films they were producing that were in need of funding so Superman 4's budget got reportedly cut in half. This results in wires showing, lifeless flying backgrounds, re-used flying shots and poorly constructed action sequences. Also reportedly, thanks to a failed test screening, roughly 40 min was cut from Superman 4, so there are many aspects of the plot, that feel rushed with questions unanswered. At the end of the day the movie is a massive letdown. Chris Reeve is the only real saving grace here, as he is always a joy to watch portraying the Man of Steel but the movie lets Reeve and the fans down, on nearly every level.2/10",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Christopher Reeve put forth a bit of effort, but that doesn't compensate for Muriel Hemmingway's woodenness, and Dolph Lungren's annoyingness (or whoever played Nuclear Man).  The special effects were particularly awful, and it's obvious that the budget for that aspect of the movie ran out as some of the effects are apparently hand-drawn and laughably unconvincing.Do not bother watching this movie.  It will ruin your image of Superman and you will forget how good the first and second movies of this series were. They should have left it as a trilogy, in my opinion (though the third one sucked too).",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
216,davidadowns,"Decent premise, but budget shows",4,23 April 2011,"I have seen recently a lot of arguments about Superman 4, mainly from people who argue that the film's message of nuclear disarmament should trump any problems with effects and story development. No movie, however noble it tries to be, is above criticism if it fails to capture the viewer. And Superman 4's problems completely overshadow any of its noble stances.Let's start with the most obvious flaw, the special (used loosely) effects. Anyone (like those I mention above) who say effects are unimportant to the movie's message need more bran in their diets. Great effects are most important in films such as these to create the illusion that the man we see on screen is really doing what he's doing. The first two Superman films did this, and are classics. Superman 4 fails at even the most basic effects. The flying scenes are the worst; you can see the wires in several shots, and the one particular shot of Superman (and Nuclear Man) coming straight at the camera is seen over and over again. In addition, the effects for space (black curtains) are visible, and there are many examples of bad green screening (the scene where Clark and Lois fall from his balcony being the most blatant).The story is also choppy in its execution. The basic premise is that Superman (Chris Reeve) is trying to destroy all nuclear weapons to protect Earth, but Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) creates Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) to destroy him. On paper, it's a good start. However, the story is littered with subplots that do little to nothing to advance the story (a direct result of editing 45 minutes out of what was released to theaters). Where did Lenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) come from? Why does Lacy Warfield (played uninspiredly by Mariel Hemingway) have the hots for Clark? How does the computer in the missile with the DNA for Nuclear Man know how to create him AND a costume from simple black material? None of these are explained, and it leaves you confused as to why these characters are important.The actors try their best with the material they have; Reeve turns in as good a performance as you could expect (though he isn't as svelte as he was previously, a minor quibble) as Hackman is good. As I stated, though, Hemingway is a bore as Lacy, and Nuclear Man will forever be identified with the 80s (not to mention Pillow never gets to actually be heard, since Hackman's voice is dubbed over his). That said, if the material was better, the performances would've stood out more.Then there are scenes which leave you simply scratching your head. How does Clark find another green crystal in the spaceship on his farm (didn't he take it out in Superman 1)? Another one is the scene where Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with...Super Repair Vision? I've never heard of him using that in the comics! Of course, the ultimate silly scene is near the end of the movie, when Nuclear Man takes Lacy into space...and she can breathe normally!!! Isn't that physically impossible??? Not to mention it's immediately followed by Superman moving the moon out of orbit to block the sun and take Nuclear Man's power away. Watch out for tidal waves, Earth!In conclusion, Superman 4 will be remembered as a cinematic failure in spite of its intentions to educate the world about the dangers of nuclear weapons. While the actors try hard, they can't overcome the obvious lack of care from the producers about developing the story and making the film look good. And when the producers don't care, why should the viewing public care?",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Superman seems to be so jovial throughout the whole movie, except when he get's the beat down from Radiation Man, or whatever they coined the other guy. It kinda seemed like Christopher Reeve and Margaret Kidder were just having fun with this one.Truthfully I don't really like any of the old Superman's for various reasons, but I can at least respect them. In this one, they just made up super powers that Superman doesn't have, which I could even go with if they explained it.My main beef with this one is, the bad guy, this Radiation Man, is supposed to be powered by the sun, and his powers are basically the sun's energy...and Superman get's his power from the yellow sun...therefore when this guy hits Superman with the energy then it should actually make Superman more powerful, but instead it gives him the flu????

218,georgekirby-64766,Literal kryptonite to the franchise.,1,16 April 2016,"This film is a contender with Batman & Robin, claiming the title for the worst comic book movie of all time. Batman & Robin arguably did significantly more damage to the source material, ruining the legacy of Batman for 8 years. However Batman was gradually redeemed with The Dark Knight trilogy, the Superman franchise has been unable to recover from all previous bad instalments. Superman Returns was abysmal, Man of Steel was incoherent and unstructured and from a recent viewing of Batman v Superman, I can honestly say it wasn't a particularly good film, inheriting the same problems that made Man of Steel dull.The elaborate production phase and budget constraints are what made this movie to the gradual process of a colossal failure. The first 3 films, with the third instalment being the film that took the franchise downhill, featured revolutionary visual effects that were outstanding for its time period. This film however, the reduced budget is so evident with a notable deterioration in quality with the effects, as they look absolutely appalling. The same archive footage of Superman flying is recycled with every shot and flying sequences are in a straight line as opposed to the cinematography they were able to achieve in the first 3 films. Christopher Reeve continues to give a good performance as Superman, arguably being the only positive aspect of the film. With 40 minutes deleted from the theatrical version, the movie feels choppy, poorly edited and nonsensical. There were attempts to make a good film, but the premise did not pay off, and the film is devoid of any redeeming qualities. Final verdict, even rating it based on its genre, in general it is one of the worst movies ever made.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
219,CaptainControl,"Doomsday didn't kill Superman, this movie did!",1,22 January 2000,"When Superman IV comes to mind, one often thinks of the pain associated with its viewing. My friend and I, after being stranded on a remote island in Papua New Guinea decided to search for entertainment. Instead, we found the Superman Series.To add a new effect we decided to view them in the opposite order (4,3,2,1). Strangely enough, special effects (which I will assume are supposed to evolve over time) improved (And Reeve's pot-belly appeared to vanish)! (By the way, to avoid embarrassment we watched them *very* late at night with curtains closed!)One also finds themselves asking where are the ""actors"" now?Perhaps Gene Hackman managed to resurrect his career after his potentially career-crippling experience in this movie. However, that big angry man that would occasionally growl (I am still debating with a friend whether the growling was also dubbed!), yes, the man they call Mark Pillow.Where is Mark Pillow now? After looking at his ""impressive"" filmography (QFP and some TV series (Alaska Kid)) one does seem to believe that QFP was in fact Career-Crippling.I have also had many a debate with a friend of mine regarding whether Pillow is constantly tormented by fellow workmates (don't try to tell me he is making his money by ""acting""), friends (if he still has any!) and family (I won't be that cruel!) with infamous lines such as ""Where is the woman!"" and ""If you don't tell me, I will hurt people!"" (I know I would!)  It is often debated as to whether he was proud of his role in such a pitiful film. We believe that he was thrown out of a bar and landed at the feet of the casting crew who felt sorry for this drunken nobody. I will assume that these people (like Margot Kidder) have been committed.Unfortunately Reeve dared fate with a second shot of the line ""Don't do it, the people."" after his ear-to-ear smile in Superman II (My friend and I believe that he was daring the phantom zone villains to beat up the innocent citizens of Metropolis with the dangerous irregular movement of a bus!), however while not smiling (this time anyway!) My friend and I were forced to declare the line as a ""Poor Reeve Call"". Lines that we have always found useful in day-to-day life include ""Excuse me, I think your sitting in my seat!"" (II) ,""Don't thank me, we're all part of the same team!"" (I),""I won't let you down again!"" (II), ""Stop, that's enough, that's enough. You win, I'll take you to her!"" (IV), ""Give it up you'll never find her"" (IV) and ""Father, I failed!"" (II). If by now you think that we are the ones that should be committed, you are obviously taking these comments far too seriously. While being very accurate, they are humourous as well!So far we haven't really commented on perhaps the most atrocious element of the movie (the special effects)! Ok, I will even accept Lacy Warfield's survival in outer space (and yes, even falling relatively downward!) I know perfectly well that these things can't possibly happen (but then again, ""Superman"" couldn't possibly exist either (sorry!)) It is fiction. However, they could have at least made it look as if it were happening. Even the special effects in the first Superman Movie were better and it was made nearly 10 years ago! I may be picky, but I would expect the effects to at least be on par with those in Superman I.My friend and I were thinking of a wonderful parallel universe where an alternate ending to the second movie involves Superman being humanized again at the end of the movie so that he can pursue his relationship with Lois. This universe would be spared of the peril of a fourth Superman movie.However, perhaps it is advisable to look at why this ""movie"" was ever made. Reeve was not in the greatest financial position of his life and needed a movie that he would be guaranteed a lead role. Perhaps this was one of the infamous Tax write-off's.

220,Mr. Irons,So disappointing,1,14 January 2000,"It's such a shame to see the franchise reduced to this after the triumphs of the first two movies.I own all four of the films on video, and the difference between the first and the last film is terrible. The first film looks fantastic, the effects are spot-on, and the music is possibly John Williams' finest score.The last one however, uses awful superimposition techniques that make Superman look pasted on to the screen, and the music is a poor reproduction of the original themes.As for the story, I think it could have been made into a good film. It wasn't, though. I know everyone has already pointed out the ridiculousness of the scene where Lacy Warfield (ugh - crap name) is taken into space, but what really got me is that when the Nuclear Man stopped being able to fly, she started to fall downwards. Not downwards as in towards Earth (which was behind here in the frame) but downwards as in towards the bottom of the screen. That's inexcusable really.When I watch the first film now, I love every minute of it, and the 'Can You Read My Mind' scene chokes me up every time. The poor reconstruction of that in this film could ruin it if you didn't look at the credits.If you've never seen this film, watch the first one again instead.

Mariel Hemmingway had nothing to work with as Lacy Warfield, but she serves her purpose of being pretty (despite the odd costume designs that she, and everyone else, sports). Gene Hackman is sleep-acting through his role, but he still manages to make Lex snidely evil. The less said about Jon Cryer's performance, the better (""The Dude of Steel? Boy, are you gonna get it!"") As for Mark Pillow? You can't fault him too much- it was his first film, and he was picked to be the sex-appeal villain (plus, his cheesy costume does him no favors.) His lines mainly consist of mouthing roars that are post-dubbed by Gene Hackman. Chris Reeve is still Superman, and his performance is his usual best. The effects are amusingly bad- flying strings abound unremoved, the models look like just what they are-models- and some of them are just bizarre. Who knew Supes had a spare mesh bag put away if she should just happen to gather all the worlds' nuclear missiles and toss them into the sun? And, who knew the Earth's countries had THAT many missiles? Who knew you could move the moon out of its orbit without causing massive problems on Earth? FINALLY, who knew you could breathe in space? Lacy Warfield has no problems doing it while hanging onto the unconscious Nuclear Man! I could go on, but if you're reading this you've most likely seen ""S4"", and understand about the effects completely. As bad as this film is, though, I find myself watching it again and again, maybe hoping that a Happy Film Fairy worked their magic and changed the film, making it better. Reeve and Kidder (as well as the rest of the film series' cast) do their best with what they have to work with. Once Chris Reeve had his accident and ended up in a wheelchair, my heart sank knowing he'd never be able to do another Superman film, and possibly end the series on a higher note than ""S4"" did. But, ""Superman 4"" is what it is, and (Spolier alert?) the Deluxe Edition DVD offers a bunch of deleted scenes(with stock music and unfinished effects)that show what ""S4"" could have been if the premiere screening hadn't been so negative as to cause massive re-editing. The film would've made a lot more sense in certain parts, and (in my opinion), a lot more fun. ""S4"" is bad, yes, but not repulsively so. Just to be able to see Chris Reeve and Lois Lane fly around the world again (albeit badly!) makes ""Superman 4: The Quest For Peace"" worth another viewing. It''d be nice to see the complete cut used for the aforementioned secret screening, but until that happens, we have this version. Which, for entertainment and nostalgia, is alright. Chris Reeve's heart was in the right place, but Cannon Films' heart was not. A shame.P.S.: If you can find a copy of the""International Version"" somehow (I recorded it on VHS from Superstation TBS several years ago), you'll see two scenes featured in the DVD Deleted Scenes section, but fully integrated into the film (full music and effects): Superman saves a little girl (actually, Chris Reeve's young daughter) from a tornado in what looks like Kansas (or possibly, Smallville): and, Superman saves Russian politicians from a nuclearmissle that Nuclear Man aims at them.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
223,rayant84,A Super Conclusion,10,11 March 2008,"The fourth film of the Superman(Christopher Reeve) saga has Superman pursuing a greater goal besides fighting for justice and romancing Lois Lane:eliminate the threat of Nuclear Arms on the World. This movie is one of my favorite Superman installments(after Superman 2).It has it all: a original plot( Superman's quest for peace), the return of Superman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor(played remarkably by Gene Hackman), a super villain just as powerful as Superman, Nuclear Man( the fighting scenes between them are outstanding), and new changes like the Daily Planet becoming a tabloid news paper. I was surprised to hear that this movie flopped at the box office and it was very criticized by fans, critics and viewers.In my opinion this film sunk because its message was very controversial.Even more Superman ceased to be an American exclusivity and look forward to every nations interests. The opening scene when Superman help a group of Russian cosmonauts in space , wow in 1987, i can only assume the thoughts of many viewers back then.The movie even suggested that there was an economical angle concerning the nuclear arms race(mainly through Lex Luthor).From my point of view, the reason this film flopped is because it meddled in to Politics.For many people super heroes belong in comic books, facing fictional problems( like for instance, an alien invasion).However it's very illogic to assume that Superman with all that power wouldn't take a stand on serious issues like nuclear arms and relegate to minor issues like saving a cat stuck on a tree.Many people expressed their dislike on this movie by focusing on the special effects.But not the entire movie has lower grade special effects, in fact there are only a few scenes.My favorite scenes like Superman worldwide chase of nuclear man, Superman missile round up in space, birth of nuclear man, metropolis show down have very good special effects. Nevertheless this movie didn't make it and it could be added to the list of films that flopped because of the audiences subjectivity.Botton line, yeah i like Superman 4 and i recommend it to anyone that haven't seeing it. In the other hand if anyone wants to see a Superman movie that's really Bad, see Superman Returns, this movie really sucks, and the irony is that it has great special effects.As anyone can't see, special effects are just one of several elements to analyze in a movie.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
224,rafsjackson,"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, MUST BE DESTORYED (spoilers)",1,23 April 2010,"I generally keep an open mind when it comes to watching films, I can take most things with a pinch of salt and generally try not to take anything to seriously, however with this film I have to say that amount of plot holes and law breaking physics just forced me to hate it! Lets get the 'alright' out of the way, the acting. The acting in this film is at best decent, Gene Hackman returns and does a great job at Lex Luthor, and extra credit is given here considering the dreadful script. Christopher Reeves again does his job as superman but lacks the charm he gave in the first to films, again this could have been due to the poor script. The rest of the cast was pretty much average or under-average, very forgettable Now onto what made this film the worst film I have ever seen, when watching this film I couldn't help notice that the writers obviously were either drunk or just monkeys as there were some major oversights, for instance in one scene, the main villain flies into outer space with Lois Lane, with Lois somehow scream, even though there is a lack of oxygen in space. Other such oversights were a fight on the moon with throwing a rock hurts superman, somehow and the main villain being created from the sun with already dressed?? I could go on and mention more but well there are literally to many to mention The music was uninspiring, John Williams opted not to score this film and instead Alexander Courage was chosen. Don't get me wrong Courage was a great composer, but he seemed to to a half-***** job and I never got the feeling of something truly evil this film is an easy miss, I watched it just out of sheer interest of how bad a film can be, There is no need to watch it, take it from me you will never see a worse film and there is no need to see it.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
225,trspamfile,Finally watched the deleted scenes and they make this all the more tragic,3,13 June 2013,"This review contains major spoilers on the deleted scenes so if you don't want to know before you watch them, stop reading now!This movie is every bit as terrible as they say. The tiny production budget from a studio that churned out cheap junk in the mid-to-late eighties really shows, especially in the special effects. Christopher Reeve really got cheated in the deal, as has been documented in several places. One of the few bright spots is Gene Hackman, who can't act poorly if he tried.Having grown up with Superman, I watch this movie every five years or so and enjoy it both for the nostalgia and the extreme awfulness, but tonight I watched the deleted scenes for the first time and they actually would have greatly improved this movie -- although it would still have been pretty bad.The scenes would fill in some gaping plot holes (for instance when Nuclear Man decides he wants Lacy Warfield, how does Superman know who he wants, versus, ""What lady?"". Also, how does Superman know the dark will rob him of his power?). They also add a lot of depth to the story, such as Lex Luther meeting with the Russians and telling them peace is a capitalist plot, and banging his shoe on the table, followed by him meeting with the American military, telling them peace is a communist plot. We also get explanations as to why the characters are doing what they're doing. There are still emotional moments with Lacy Warfield's development as a person and even a tender moment and kiss with Clark Kent.The deleted scenes still have real weaknesses, such as Superman being a painfully obvious stunt double when being thrown by Nuclear Man One. The scenes with Nuclear Man are intended to be humorous, but they're a little over-the-top with silliness.I think the deleted scenes add the most where they make us give a damn about the characters and events, with some of the more tender cues from the original John Williams score.This movie is a real shame all the way around. It's a shame that it was a disappointment for fans and Christopher Reeve, and that it absolutely killed the franchise. It's even sadder since this was the last Superman film, followed by Christopher Reeve's awful fate.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
226,rjohnson1,The worst of the five Superman movies,3,12 September 2010,"There was only one thing that made this movie watchable. Christopher Reeve. He originally refused to star in Superman IV. If he hadn't starred in it, this would've been the worst movie ever made. Superman saved his life by using a green crystal that he found in Smallville. It was stupid that Superman could die by getting scratches on the back of his neck. If bullets, tanks and bombs can't hurt him, how can scratches kill him? It was even more stupid when the scratches turned him into an old man. Another stupid thing was when Nuclearman took Lacy Warfield into outer space and it didn't kill her. This was the only part of the movie that ticked me off. I did like the fight on the moon. I think it was neat when Nuclearman beat Superman into the ground. This movie didn't suck but it was the worst of the five films.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

That was the main thing that made my jaw drop. But it wasn't the only thing. Oh no. Somebody mentioned the action sequence when Superman moved the moon to block out the Sun. Well, aside from the horrendous effect this would have on the earth and the near impossibility of getting it back into the same place, at the same speed to maintain it's orbit, did anyone else notice how small the moon was as Superman grabbed hold of it?? If you freeze-frame and go up to the TV and draw an imaginary circle following it's circumference, you'll see that the Moon is about the size of a small shopping centre (when it's about the size of America) or Supes is about 700miles tall! Oh, and before I finish, when Supes is thrown by Nuclear Man, why does he a) scream? when he is used to flying through the air. And b) Not just stop in mid-air? I mean - what's the point of throwing someone who can fly anyway?? 24crt gold Priceless.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
228,jonkellymacintyre,"It's a bird, it's a plane, no its a flying piece of crap",5,5 July 2006,"I am being really nice here by giving this one a five. The only reason I give it a five is when Superman addresses the UN at the end of the film saying that it was up to the whole world to stop nuclear war, not just one man- being Superman. Gene Hackman did what he could. There wasn't really much to work with for him in this movie, but he still pulls of Luther well. Christopher Reeve pretty well always does Superman okay, no one can dispute that. But, the rest just sucked.I know it was the 80's, but why the hell was John Cryer acting like such a putz? The great thing about the first two films (other than a couple of minor things) is that its pretty well timeless. The guy who played the Nuclear Man was the worst bit of acting I'd ever seen. It was like watching Arnold buying a happy meal at McDonald's.Honestly the whole idea of the bad Superman was touched in Superman III. If they wanted to do something different, they should have just went with the whole bizzaro thing. Which could have been interesting. The characters all lacked substance. Even Superman. Not only that but he has powers that don't even exist in the comics. Like putting the Great Wall by looking at it. This movie really sucked. I'd rip into it more, but I like Chris Reeve too much, and to rip into the film that he wrote seems wrong to me. So, just don't watch this. Even the Dean Cain series was better than this.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
229,demon4998,UGH!!!!!!,1,15 October 2000,"Superman I and II were great, III was somewhat ok, but they probably shouldn't have made it.  Superman 4 was a blatant attempt to squeeze out whatever profits were left for a Superman movie.  All the other comments say something about Mariel Hemingway being taken out into space and being able to breathe and *NOT* implode.  But what seems to be missing is the part how Lex Luthor got the Superman DNA from a hair.  You see, Superman donated a hair to a museum to show how strong it is.  The hair was holding up a really heavy steel ball that weighed a couple of hundred pounds.  All Lex had to do was snap the hair with a simple pair of bolt-cutters!  Then when the ball hits the ground, it bounced a little bit!  What a bunch of c**p.  The part where Superman and Lois copy the scene from the Original movie where they fly hand in hand was really bad.  In the original, that was a long scene. In this stinker, the scene was a minute or so?  I can't go on anymore. Let's make this the #1 worst movie of all time.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
230,signs933,Well intentioned film...,6,8 March 2001,"Superman 4 has good ideas and good performances, but was ruined when the director cut 40 minutes from the film before release. Among other things, the denouement in which Nuclear Man defies Luthor and turns himself into a nuclear missile in order to spark World War III. In order to see what the film should have been, I suggest one seek out the DC Comic Adaptation. This film, as Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman deserves to be restored for DVD. The reason for Superman using powers he has never had, was the result of unfinished effects. The great wall of China scene should have been finished by adding Superman fixing the wall at super speed, and finished with Superman sealing it with heat vision.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

The acting is sub par by ""Superman"" Standards, the director didn't even try to make it look like New York or Close enough to Metropolis, the visuals on the movie takes the term""Low Budget"" to a whole another level,the story sounded good on paper like I said earlier, and all that was once great fell to parp.

It was depressing to know that this was the final harrah of Christopher reeve, especially when superman has a gut the size of a 6 month pregnant woman. There were so many scenes where platforms, wires, rewinding of film, and frame skipping were clearly evident. The first scene for example, when the cosmonaut got his head chopped off and in the next scene his head was back in place. The mistakes of this movie were unforgivable.It was just a horrible movie in which they didn't care how crappy they made it, just as long as they did and people saw it because of the superman pedigree. It was so horribly bad and had so many plot holes it resembled swiss cheese.With that being said, this is what made it entertaining. No matter how much this movie raises my ire I have to admit it was wonderfully entertaining and i recommend renting the movie so you can find all of the errors, similar to a where's waldo book (replacing waldo with errors).

My review of Superman III was pretty scathing, but this movie is beyond my wildest nightmares of ridiculous-ness on film. We all know that the special effects budget was sacrificed to shoot this. But what is a fantasy movie like Superman without the special effects??? C'mon!!Gene Hackman (one of my favorite actors) was turned into a sissified 2nd rate thug. He never appeared to have ""the greatest criminal mind of our time"" or ""most diabolical ruler of our age"" type of demeanor. Why, Gene! Why? Why did you do this role? You're still the man, though. I saw 'The French Connection' for the first time this weekend, and loved it.Christopher Reeve (one of my favorite actors and since his passing, one of my favorite people) was decent. Although I hated hearing him bellow, ""No! Don't do it! The people!!!"" I cringe every time I think about it. At least they got is hair the right color this time.Nuclear Man...WTF!?!??? Okay...okay...okay. Let's, for a brief moment, assume that his character was a good idea. Could they have found a worse actor??? I think not. ""Nuclear Man: If you don't tell me where she is...I will hurt people!"" And this line was delivered after Superman's teeth gnashing line, ""Don't do it...the people!!"" But since his character and casting of his character weren't good ideas, I won't let it go that easily. WTF!?!?! WTF??!?! OMG!!! Stupid all the way around! Jackie Cooper as Perry White: Is it me or did all the characters look drawn in and sullen. But no one more than Perry White. Not only that, as with Lex Luthor...what happened to the tough editor of the Daily Planet? He was watered down and punked out.It was good to see Lois back. Glad you got your issues with management squared away, Margot.Even the dumbest of directors would have to think that Earthlings MAY have an issue with being carried to the moon.

234,ogremage12,Utterly hilarious,10,26 March 2008,"Every single other comment for this movie has not given it anything more than a 3 out of 10. I can only assume that they watched the movie believing it would be any good.Superman movies have always been campy (yes, even *before* that lovable hack Richard Lester threw his half-baked lot into Superman II), but people thought Superman III was the ultimate, the final, the only possible depth to which the Superman series could sink. It was unabashedly a comedy and it performed poorly, so the Salkinds left the series forever and handed the producing duties over to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, two wild and crazy guys from Israel who *just* wanted to illegally funnel funds from Superman IV and cut corners everywhere. They did so, and the film bombed at the box office.But it shouldn't have. The problem wasn't at all with the script, the acting or the movie itself; the problem was with the people who saw it. They were expecting a serious Superman movie. What they got was the most unintentionally hilarious movies of all time, an understated classic of bad cinema.There is only one way to watch this movie, and that is to watch it with friends and mock it endlessly. Despite the large-ish budget and well-known character, Superman IV would do very well as an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (a 90s TV show dedicated to mocking B-movies). It has everything: bad eighties hairstyles, completely illogical plot lines and more failed special effects than an episode of the old Doctor Who. Strings are easily visible, a police car magically appears out of thin air, Superman is referred to as ""The Dude of Steel"" and people seem to be oddly capable of breathing in space, not to mention the dialogue: ""You know what I can do with a single strand of Superman's hair?"" ""You can make a toupee that flies!"" If you're not as immature nor as odd as I am, the effect may be replicated by making a drinking game of the movie or inhaling illicit substances, but how it happens is not important. What is important is that this movie should not be condemned as a horrible serious movie, but be respected as a fantastic, if unintentional, comedy.See you in twenty, indeed.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

Each Superman movie lost its clout. Superman The movie was the best and when Ilya Salkind and Richard Doner fell out you could tell the quality of superman was poor from superman III onwards. Christopher Reeve should have not donned the cape for 4 times and left it hanging in superman 2. Virtually all scenes were recorded in a studio no real outdoor live effects, and a lot of things didn't make sense! Why did thermal man kidnap the new Daily Planet publisher?! where was he going to take her when they flew into space? why did she live and able to breathe in space? why was all flying scenes recorded against back drop blue screen? Why was a lot of the scenes for the daily planet recorded in Milton Keynes instead of New York City?! NO NO NO! Superman should be treated like its first film, in-depth smart and funny. Excellent cast and a big budget to make it real. This could have been so good if it had the budget. Some aspects were good such as the visit to smallville, the love interest with Clarke and Lacy Warfield,the take over of the daily planet, and the films theme of nuclear disarmament, and most of the original cast...

The movie although offers a little story it's good because if you're an all action film fan than this film is for you since most of the story is about Superman fighting Nuclearman in several climatic battles across the world and even on the moon. It's a shame that not to many think so and besides this Superman film is an environmental film ifyou consider all of the nuclear talk here. We need to consider that this movie was produced in 1987.

245,charlie-teague,The worst case scenario for a sequel,2,21 April 2014,"Oh the potential this movie had, Christopher Reeve and the original cast from the first two films were truly behind this one but alas that could not make up for the lack of budget and shoddy script. Poor visual effects aside, this movie is just hastily cobbled together from a few half-baked ideas that aren't fully realised, with the character motivations and the way certain plot points come to fruition not making a lick of sense.I understand that 45 or so minutes of this film were left on the cutting room floor, but having both watched the deleted scenes and read the original script for the movie, I have to say that even if all of the footage had been left in this movie would still have been a mess. I appreciate the idea of a scenario where an omnipotent superhero is put against a real world crisis but the way it plays out here doesn't do the premise justice, I would have much preferred it if the world authorities were resistant to Superman's plan for worldwide disarmament and were inadvertently united in the cause to prevent his interference, but instead there is no challenge, no moral panic, no humanity, it is just bear bones bad writing. Even so I have to say that Christopher Reeve's decision to focus the film on an overt anti-nuclear war message was a mistake from the start, not to mention it instantly dates the film and makes it come across as pretentious and trying too hard to educate rather than entertain.Yes the effects are terrible, yes the lack of money shows in almost every frame, yes the film would have been better if certain scenes were left in, but despite this every problem with the film boils down to the script. A competent writer would adapt a script to better suit a reduced budget, and while it may make sense to keep the original scale of the story if the budget was cut shortly before filming but in this case the budget was cut over a year before production started! And when that happens it is the responsibility of the writer to change the story so that the scale is less important, but rather the characters and morals are the focus. This happened with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the budget was severely reduced and so the director rewrote it to focus more on the characters and less on the action, and that film turned out wonderfully, why didn't that happen here?! The film is a sad end to an otherwise classic (or half classic) movie saga and unfortunately leaves Christopher Reeve, the definitive man of steel, in a bad light. While the film perhaps tops Superman III for good intentions and being a guilty pleasure, it's far from the film it should have been.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace

248,darrenhutton2,Is this film so bad?,5,17 April 2005,"I have just watched the 89 minute cut of superman 4 and i've asked myself is this a stinker of a film or not and my answer to that is no i don't think it is.Why you ask when most of the world thinks it is well i shall tell you.Well it's world renowned that cannon were cheapskates and the budget was only 10 million on this film but that aside what Sidney j furie did with this film was i think a much better film than superman 3.I liked the story the acting i think was on par with the other films and i enjoyed the action scene's especially the fight around the world with the nuclear man and it kept me entertained however there are bad points about this film as much as it kept me entertained which included Lenny who was as about as much use in this film as a chocolate tea pot and ""THE NUCLEAR MAN"" what purpose does he serve in this film he is that bad that Gene Hackman has to voice him so i can only imagine Marc pillow was more wooden than a park bench and also when superman and nuclear man are fighting in space it's so obvious that they are on a blacked out stage.What really bothers me about this film is that somebody out there has the full 143 minute version and i think this is the problem with superman 4 the general public have seen a watered down version which in some places this film makes no sense where as the full version that was laughed at by critics in an advanced screening would make more sense than this version we have to put up with and lets face it the real critics are real movie fans who do not get paid for there views unlike these posh art house lovers who would dissect care bears the movie if they had the chance.In closing i would like to say two things about this movie (1) This film is voted one of the worst films of all time because we have a watered down version that makes no sense in places.(2)Warner brothers or cannon whoever has the rights to the full uncut version do the decent thing and give us the general public and superman lovers across the world the the right to view superman 4 the quest for peace in it's full uncut glory if not for us then let's have Christopher reeve doing what he does best in these films and entertaining us and believing that a man can really fly",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
249,chealfonza,The worst Superman movie ever made.,1,25 March 2016,The one biggest reason this movie sucks because stupid CGI.For an example look at when Superman is flying in front of the screen.I know this movie is old and all but I've seen classic James Bond movies that has better CGI and I think they don't even have CGI.At first I thought this was going to be a good movie but I was wrong.I just finished watch Man Of Steel and I wanted to watch the fourth Superman movie because I watched all but never got to watch the fourth one.I was half excited and half scared.Then my whole body stoke into wrath.There is one thing that Sidney got right.The people.Superman doesn'tcare if he is getting beaten but he cares if the people r hurt.So if u want to watch a good family movie please don't pick Quest For Peace.Movies u can watch is like Grown Ups 2 and 1.But please don't watch this one.One more thing.At the end when he flies out of earth this movie has the SAME ending as the last one but just different lighting.How stupid.I'm going to give Superman IV The Quest For Peace an F.,Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
250,R-J-Weston,superman iv rubbish,1,11 May 2007,"I remember sitting on my seat at the cinema, waiting for the next Superman film to begin.Then suddenly realising what an real and complete load of rubbish this film is.The acting, well, apart from, Chris Reeve (bless him), Gene Hackman, Mariel Hemmingway and Margot Kidder, is awful, (Mark Pillow, stand to attention) The Effects, 25p, that's what they must have cost.All in all, this so called excuse for a film is awful.It's so bad it makes, Superman III, and Superman Returns look like classics.My advice, stay as far away from this film as you can.It is just plain awful.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
251,colinsdds,Second Worst Superman,3,24 November 2018,"A better plot would involve the Man of Steel intervening to prevent this cinematic catastrophe from being filmed, but sadly it actually was. Fortunately, it is at least fun to watch.Where to start? Well, Lex Luthor escapes from prison, which is about as difficult as walking out of a Wal-Mart with a candy bar. And no one seems to care.Then there is Nuclear Man (or as Luthor repeatedly days, ""Nuke-yuh-ler"") who is about as intimidating as a man in an irridescent jumpsuit with long silver fingernails, because that's what he is. Apparently related genetically to Superman this Sun-powered villain seems to have missed out on the brains gene, or maybe not because our brilliant hero can't seem to figure out that stopping a sun powered villain would simply mean putting somewhere dark.But regardless of the mishmash of pointlessness that is the script and special effects on par with a high school play this is still a cinematic marvel as compared to Superman II which might actually be the worst waste of celluloid in history.Your IQ will probably drop a little if you watch this, but if you feel you have a few points to spare give it a shot.",Superman IV - The Quest for Peace
