0,SnoopyStyle,like the duo but not the movie,5,29 April 2020,Lifelong best friends Mel (Rose Byrne) and Mia Carter (Tiffany Haddish) have a tiny struggling cosmetic company called Mel & Mia's. They get an investment from cosmetic tycoon Claire Luna (Salma Hayek) but she intends to break up the friends and steal their company.I really love Byrne and Haddish. They could be a really good comedy duo but they are handcuffed by this clunky premise. It's written like a bad 80's movie. I just want these funny ladies to be in a better movie. They can play friends and they can play enemies. They can be in the bigger group or be Thelma & Louise. What they can't do is fix a bad premise and write their own movie. Maybe they should write their own movie.,Like a Boss
1,Prismark10,Like a Boss,2,19 April 2020,"Maybe if a studio is going to green light a movie such as Like a Boss. They should get a female director or make sure most of the writers are female.I just thought the men involved in this film tried to deliberately sabotage this alleged comedy.Mia (Tiffany Haddish) and Mel (Rose Byrne) have been best friends since school and started a cosmetic company together.They have an offer from makeup tycoon Claire Luna (Salma Hayek) who wants to invest in the company.Mia is not interested but Mel is as the company is heavily in debt.Of course Luna wants to drive the pair apart and take over the company and product line.The film is not funny and is an insult to female empowerment.Anyone with sense would run a mile from Luna from the moment they see her and her erratic behaviour. Even if they took her offer seriously, they would discuss it with other people such as a business adviser or their accountant and take the contract to their lawyers. They might even Google more about Luna's business practices.Instead we see Mel and Mia do none of these things and they constantly bicker, usually in front of Luna.This is a dumb nonsense movie.",Like a Boss
2,nogodnomasters,Follow your juices,3,5 February 2020,"Mia (Tiffany Haddish) and Mel (Rose Byrne ) own a cosmetic store with their own product line. They live together and are going broke. Salma Hayek offers to partner with them and does so aggressively in such a way as to cause the friends to have a riff.The all-female lead cast comedies have met with success. This one is not one of them. I love Rose Byrne as the voice of Lexi, in this film she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Her hair was simply awful for someone in her line. The dialogue attempted to pass crudeness for humor. This normally works but fell flat in this film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Like a Boss
3,kosmasp,Friends and Bosses,6,11 November 2020,"Let's keep it real: this is as predictable as they get. It still can be fun, especially if you are a fan of the actors involved. Salma Hayek has quite apparently a lot of fun being evil. And then you have the two besties, who have their issues that need adressing. And again, as I said, the movie or the plot of it, should not surprise you in the least.But with some great cameos and side characters thrown in, who all have some funny one liners from time to time, this can be a neat little time waister. Depending on your taste you will be ok with this or not ... I've seen worse for sure",Like a Boss
4,BandSAboutMovies,Stuck,4,1 August 2020,"Man, this quarantine is killing me. If my wife wants to watch something, now we watch it. I've seen more than a few Tiffany Haddish movies now. Let me share my pain with you.I put on a strong front in these posts, but trust me, I always get roped in to these movies.Haddish and Rose Byrne play childhood best friends who are more like sisters. Their makeup company is on the verge of bankruptcy when their get an offer from Salma Hayak's character, who is obviously going to screw them at the end and try to ruin their friendship.As basic as this film is, I enjoyed the casting of Jennifer Coolidge and Pittsburgh native Billy Porter. I also really liked another movie by director Miguel Arteta, 2009's Youth In Revolt, which played with the expectations of teen movies pretty nicely.",Like a Boss
5,CinemaSerf,How do these things ever get commissioned?,4,24 February 2020,"Wasn't going to bother seeing this, but it was raining so I thought I'd take a chance... The writing was on the wall when I arrived at the cinema to looks from the staff along the lines of ""have you been drinking this evening?"" Only me in the 400-seat auditorium and within ten minutes we were at a baby shower making jokes about a cake shaped like a vagina complete with chocolate flakes of ""pubic hair""... Yep, that's about as sophisticated as this gets. A lifelong couple of friends (Rose Byrne & Tiffany Haddish) running a loss-making make up business find themselves in the sights of Salma Hayek who has a huge multi-national. She offers - a la ""Dragons Den"" - to pay off their debt in return for a huge stake in their company then tries to drive a wedge between them.... The dialogue is rapid-fire and suitably bad ass. but on the whole the film is puerile - though mercifully short. Hayek tries hard to salvage something from this dross but I'm afraid it's too limited in scope and aspiration to be witty or clever.",Like a Boss

Yet the totally bogus SCOTUS has legislated that these corrupt gangster fronts are ""people"" in its scandalous ""One Dollar, One Vote"" United against We the People edict. LIKE A BOSS documents exactly WHY the corrupt, larcenous, back-stabbing Fat Cat Rich One Per Center ilk such as ""Claire Luna"" MUST be outlawed ASAP, even if it takes Civil War to do it. Claire is shown here constantly scheming and plotting to snatch away the few bread crumb resources and small joys for which We Little People--including ""Mel & Mia""--have toiled, scrimped and slaved. Without devilish amoral corporations to shield them from their inherent lack of ethics, honesty and moral character, demons like Claire could be swiftly nipped in the butt by an outraged Public. Instead, they're allowed to smirk like Smaug the Dragon atop their golden money mounds of will-gotten Wealth, with the U.S. Government and its Injustice System at their beck and call.

7,ferguson-6,"not hideous, but no thing of beauty",5,9 January 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's no secret that all movies aren't made to appeal to all movie goers. Even for someone like me who watches an average of 5 movies per week, there are going to be some that are simply not in my wheelhouse. In the case of this latest from director Miguel Arteta (BEATRIZ AT DINNER, 2017), it seems to have been formulated as a ""Girls Night Out"" treat ... a sub-genre with a track record of success.Although I'm not the target market, I'm not precluded from commenting on the film and making observations. It merely means I've watched the movie from a different perspective than many paying customers will. So let's start with the positives. The cast is excellent. After being wasted and miscast is last year's disappointing THE KITCHEN, Tiffany Haddish is cut loose and allowed to do what she does best - searing one-liners peppered with raunchiness. Rose Byrne has long been what was once called a comedy ""straight man."" Of course that term is no longer used, but I'm not sure what today's acceptable terminology is. The simple fact is, very few people are as brilliant as Ms, Byrne at playing off an acid-tongued comic. She is a rare talent. As for Salma Hayek, her body of work (and Oscar nomination for FRIDA) speaks for itself.Mia (Ms. Haddish) and Mel (Ms. Byrne) have been friends since childhood, and are now roommates, best friends, and business partners at the beauty/cosmetic company they founded. The creative and shoot-from-the-hip Mia and the pragmatic and meticulous Mel are personality opposites to the point that Mel has been reticent to explain their serious financial woes to the always upbeat Mia. When cosmetics tycoon Claire Luna (Ms. Hayek) makes an offer to save the struggling company, Mel welcomes the financial relief, while Mia senses trouble.As you would guess, Mia is right ... Claire Luna has darker motives, and soon she is driving a wedge between the two partners and friends. The talented supporting cast includes: Jennifer Coolidge, Billy Porter (who manages to remain flamboyant while being subdued for him), Ari Graynor (""I'm Dying Up Here""), Jessica St. Clair, and Karan Soni (DEADPOOL) as Claire's assistant. There is also a cameo near the end for those who enjoy a bit of friendly comedy.Danielle Sanchez Witzel, Adam Cole-Kelly, and Sam Pitman combined on the story and script, and have inserted a few gags that play to the strength of the cast - pot smoking ghost peppers, and boyfriend humor are all at play, and balanced by the strength of female friendships. The business side is so cartoonish (especially Ms. Hayek's character) that it will likely somewhat offend anyone who actually runs a company, but the raunchy humor and overly emotional character reactions will likely satisfy the intended audience.",Like a Boss

Mia and Mel played by Rose Byrne and Tiffany Haddish have been friends since high school. They both have a cosmetics company they both opened up together. Sadly, they are in Dept and owe a lot. Until Salma Hayeks character shows up and her company wants to partner up with them which she would help there money problem. But Mel and Mia do not agree how she is running her cosmetics products.The plot has a cute fun theme about friendships and greed. Sadly, the film does lack humor. It is unfunny. Rose Byrne and Tiffany Haddish are entertaining. But the movie script and direction humor is plain awkward and cringing. Salma Hayek plays a great villain as a greedy boss. While the movie suffers from awkward and out of place humor.Overall, Like a Boss is bad. It is boring. Unfunny. And the story is predictable.",Like a Boss

13,subxerogravity,"If I have to think about it, it's not really funny.",5,10 January 2020,"It has it funny moments and it's a great message, but it's not that impressive.
Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne don't have the chemistry needed to pull of this movie off about two best friends since childhood stating a business. Byrne always seemed out of place in this Haddish vehicle and oddly enough Haddish seemed out of place in her own vechicle. It feels like she's holding back what makes everyone want to see her. It's like Haddish at one instead of eleven.
Jennifer Cooledge suffers from the same thing. I did not get the full on Coolledge I was going for when I saw her that she was In The flick.
Selma Hayek works as the villain but it's only a workable performance she did not make me laugh.
Give it up to Billy Porter who tried to steel the scene when he was in it and in some cases he did.

Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne are both very talented, but in the beginning there chemistry just wasn't there, but it got better has the movie went on.

This is a pretty standard by the numbers plot. A big corporation wants to buy a small one and put them out of business. Tiffany & Rose are childhood friends that create their own beauty company but are currently loosing money. Salma owns the big company that offers to buy them out of debt. She tricks them-of course-in order to take all of their assets and they have to fight back to try and save their business. Jennifer is one of Tiffany & Rose's employees that tries to be funny on occasion. There is friction between Tiffany & Rose-caused by Salma-but you know that they will work out their problems before the end credits.
It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 23 minutes.

Haddish and Byrne are playing generic stereotypes through the whole movie and there's never a surprise or moment where it tries anything different.Then there's Hayek. Normally I really enjoy her, she brings a fun, quirkiness to her work. The hair and makeup team here took her and transformed her into some ridiculous cartoon Barbie though and the writing isn't much better. Every moment she's on screen annoyed me. She's trying but there's only so much she can do to make this mess work.This was a huge disappointment of a movie. I'm sure someone out there might enjoy it but honestlyI just don't see it. At best, this is a tremendously generic comedy and at worst it's a huge waste of talent.

21,ShelbyTMItchell,"See if you are a fan of Rose, Tiffany, and/or Selma",7,18 January 2020,"Tiffany Haddish is the one that tries so hard to bring the comedy as one that wants to be rich and live in a life of luxury that is not a team player.
Her best friend since HS Rose Byrne doing a great American accent is meek and at times not sure of herself. As they run a make up business that is in debt but still people go to them for make up including their snobby but funny friends.
Selma Hayek is the villianess as a mogul who wants to help them out of their misery but in the process, has hidden agendas of her own.
Jennifer Cooledge steals the movie and wished she gotten better parts but really she steals the fun with that of Billy Porter who makes the makeup but he is relieved of his job due to Selma's insistence. Realizing it is a wrong mistake there. It is about being true to yourself no matter where life takes you.

The actors chemistry, alongside some fun writing moments and good morals are the selling points for this film, with fans of Haddish and Byrne comedy being the target audience to see this work. However, this girl's night out flick, as described in the trailers is still missing the balance and art that other comedies have achieved. It's catered to the modern attention span and presentation and while it works, it's not something that has to be seen in theaters.

23,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Like a Boss,2,21 January 2020,"""Business and friendship don't always mix"". Comedies and January release dates don't always mix either. My latest review is 2020's Like a Boss and it came out last week. Whoever had a hand in making it needs to be ""demoted"" or drummed out.Anyway, have you ever taken in a raunchy chick flick that sort of evaporates as you view it? And have you ever seen an R-rated farce that's dirty yet fails to really push the envelope? Like a Boss is both of these things and it makes stuff like Girls Trip and Bridesmaids feel like Oscar winners in comparison.Like a Boss, with its genitalia jokes, its workplace drones, and its umpteenth filming location in Atlanta, Georgia, is like an 83-minute exercise in which comedic scenes flop and die. Director Miguel Arteta (he's mostly a TV guy) favors a lousy script for actresses who deserve a better one. He also favors outtake-style line deliveries as opposed to the funnier bits that were obviously left in the trailers.Distributed by Paramount Pictures, harboring a look of feminine pastel purgatory, and featuring an overreaching co-star in Salma Hayek, Like a Boss is about female besties Mel and Mia (played by Rose Byrne and always-in-character Tiffany Haddish). They run a cosmetics company that's about to go under until they invest with a nasty magnate who wants to steal all their good ideas.In truth, the screenplay for Like a Boss is its biggest culprit. Rambling on about friendship and roaring career women, it feels arbitrarily dated, totally unfunny, trite, and completely fanciful. It brings out the worst in the actors even if they brought their A game or Meryl Streep for moral support.Bottom line: Thanksgiving has come early this year in the form of Like a Boss. It's truly a turkey. Better yet, it's a turkey with cheap mascara and silver ball bearings attached to it. Dug the title though. Rating: 1 star.",Like a Boss

Director: Miguel Arteta
Starring: Rose Byrne, Tiffany Haddish, Salma Hayek, Billy Porter, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Coolidge, Karan Soni etcOverall rating 70/100Like a boss is based on two best friends Mia (Tiffany Haddish) and Mel ( Rose Byrne) who start there own make up company, but after they come into some issues with money they accept an offer from
Claire Luna ( Salma Hayek) who seeks to help them build a successful company but her real goals are to destroy their friendship. Like a boss was a lot of fun and was Rose and Tiffany's best comedic performances, it was sadly held back from some things however, so lets talk about this moreFirst off the chemistry and comedic performances from Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne was fantastic as well as some other standouts. Wow Both Tiffany and Rose bought their best comedic performances here. With Rose bringing the more relatable and awkward humour, and Tiffany bringing her infectious and over the top humour that I have grown to love. Their chemistry as friends in this film was fantastic, and you genuinely believed that they really cared for each other and had been through a lot so they both definitely made the movie for me. Other great standouts for me was Billy Porter and Natasha Rothwell. Natasha was very funny and bought a lot of I am sure relatable humour for people with children with some very funny scenes. And Billy porter was fantastic, I did have some issues with his character which I will get into, but there was no denying his talent and his fantastic execution of humour. He commanded the screen whenever he was on it, and he served as the kick up the ass that the characters needed when they needed it the most.However, my first two negatives would be the stereotypes for some of the characters and the simplicity of the plot. I did like Billy porter in this film, but he did reinforce the comedic stereotype of having a gay assistant/best friend character, I am getting a bit tired of these stereotypes and comedy should be trying to evolve not stick to traditions. They also spent to long trying to pit the female best friends against each other, I get that's what Salma Hayek's character wanted but I feel like they spent to much time on this, so they were at each other's throats more than they were unified with each other. Also, the plot was just to simple, the film can be explained in about 15 seconds which sadly tells you what kind of movie you are going into. I still had fun on the characters journey throughout, but it would of just been nice to have something unexpected or complex happening.My next two positives would be the humour and the heart-warming tone. Whilst obviously bringing out a lot of laughs Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne also bought some heart-warming moments to the film. As the film told us more about how long they had both been friends for and the difficult times they have got each other through you couldn't help but feel all warm inside and relate to their friendship as everyone has that kind of best friend. Plus, the film did its job well and was absolutely hilarious. This film was making me laugh pretty much non-stop throughout. There was so many fun and infectious characters, great one liners and relatable awkward moments the movies humour connected with me well and they weren't afraid to go slightly controversial as well which I liked.My next positive would be Salma Hayek. I thought that she was fantastic as the villain here. She had loads of funny moments. But you also really disliked her as well for how fake her character was in trying to destroy a friendship but when their company does well to want to be friends with them again. Salma played this role perfectly, further proving that she is not only a great actress but a great comedic actress as well.My final two negatives would be that the film was predictable and there were some very irritating characters. You could tell what was going to happen with this film pretty much as soon as it begun. Due to its simplicity and lack of surprises you could tell that they were going to be friends, have financial troubles take a deal from a dodgy businesswoman lose their friendship and regain it that was it really nothing to memorable or complex. People will remember the humour and characters from this not the plot. And for me there was some really irritating characters that didn't work. The characters played by Jennifer Coolidge and Karan Soni were just annoying. Whenever they were both on screen they just annoyed me and felt irrelevant and for me contributed nothing towards the film. Neither of their humour sadly landed for me either so this was a shame.My final two positives would be the films positive and important messages and the ending was satisfying. The films messages about friendship, embracing and loving each others flaws and not allowing bullies to control your life are important modern and issues and they were executed for me very well and naturally. Also the ending was very satisfying. To see Mia and Mel stand up to Claire and make their company a success was admittedly great to see, and the little rendition of Tina Turner which was there go to song was a lot of fun to watch and I left the film mostly satisfied with the end result.Overall Like a boss did its job well by making you laugh, having great messages and possibly the best comedic performances of Rose Byrnes and Tiffany Haddish's careers. But is sadly held down by to many things in order for it to be considered a comedy classic.",Like a Boss
36,movieman6-413-929510,Like a Boss comes across as an unrealistic cartoon.,4,28 February 2020,"Like a Boss is a new comedy directed by Miguel Arteta, the director of The Good Girl and Duck Butter.In the film, the two girlfriends Mel (Rose Byrne) and Mia (Tiffany Haddish) try to start a successful cosmetics company. Because they have high financial debts, the two are not really able to become successful in the cosmetics world. If the successful cosmetic giant Claire Luna (Salma Hayek) then offers the two a tempting offer to buy their business, the two are faced with a difficult choice. If they let their company be sold, they have a better chance of success, but this way they lose their own creative freedom. This choice stress also puts enormous pressure on the friendship between the two girlfriends, because they both look at Claire's deal with different eyes.This film starts as a comic film about two girlfriends trying to break through in the cosmetics world. Unfortunately, the film soon turns into an overly comedy, which feels a bit more like the script for a cartoon animation. The film loses its realism as a nel and it is difficult to take seriously. For people who like a bit too exaggerated comedy, this movie can still be entertaining. Tiffany Haddish is known as a comedy actress who comes to the fore in her comedy films. If you like that kind of comedy, you can also enjoy the comedy in this movie, but otherwise you'd better watch another comedy. The comedy scenes sometimes appear a bit too isolated from each other only in an attempt to incorporate extra comic scenes in the film.Rose Byrne and Tiffany Haddish seem credible as best friends, but both have played in better comedy films. Rose Byrne, for example, was better and funnier in the Bad Neighbors films and Bridesmaids. Tiffany Haddish does appropriate comedy acting thanks to the exaggerated script, but in her other films she came across as better. Salma Hayek has also played in better films, but it can be seen that she enjoyed playing this role. The rest of the cast also tries to come across as comical, but unfortunately only make the film look a bit messier",Like a Boss

Even for a comedy it is extremely generic.It's just a load of scenes which are there to just be funny mixed in with some scenes with a laughably cartoonish villain. I hate the messages in these kinds of films instead of feeling natural, they cram it so far down your throat.Now I watch a lot of films which aren't aimed at me but regardless this film does hardly anything right. Rose Byrne and Salma Hayek have been good in films before, but they failed here. Tiffany Haddish is not good, never has been really. I do not like her as a comedy actress at all.

Like A Boss is a feeble, predictable buddy comedy that retreads an old premise, does absolutely nothing new and only succeeds in its pairing of its stars, Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne. The basic premise is that two life-long friends own a make-up company, Mia & Mel, that's falling on hard financial times when they get approached by a cosmetics mogul played by a be-wigged, Salma Hayek. Hijinks ensue! And, do they learn a lesson about friendship? Miguel Arteta has directed this derivative comedy and not really found anything worthy of your time or the stars.There are very few bright spots here. Rose Byrne is an unlikely comedic actress. She's been good in supporting roles in Bridesmaids and Neighbors. There are bigger comedy stars, but Byrne has her niche. She does well here as desperate and downtrodden, in a funny way. Although a bigger personality, Tiffany Haddish falls in line with Byrne's rhythms and they ultimately work well together. I wish there was a better project for them. I'll also note that Billy Porter has some good scenes and gets some laughs. The problem with the scenes with Porter is that they are in the trailer and TV commercials, so you know exactly what's coming.Like a Boss does zip by. While being very formulaic and predictable, the movie does not linger on anything. In fact, the end comes very fast on the heels of the final confrontation. (You know how these movies go!) At one point, the characters mention weeks have gone by but it had barely been a minute of movie time. It was all very slight, not surprising and not funny enough to be worth it.All of the talents involved have better movies or TV projects that you could watch. Watch Girls Trip for a 20th time for your Tiffany Haddish fix. Rose Byrne is better in Neighbors or Bridesmaids or Spy. Check out Salma Hayek in Beatriz at Dinner, which was also directed by Miguel Arteta. I will say that there was a group of raucous, probably drunk, ladies in the theater I was in, who cackled, howled and talked through much of the movie.If you must, grab your drunk girlfriends and run the movie in the background on your girls' night in this summer, but skip it in the theater.

56,helenbassett,Like A Boss Film Review - Miguel Arteta Directs Girl Power Tiffany Haddish & Rose Byrne As Childhood Friends & Beauty Partners Facing Up To Salma Hayek's Big Breasts,8,27 February 2020,"Salma Hayek must have one hell of a marriage, imagine having all that fashion to hand. And we see lots of Gucci on screen in Like A Boss. Directed by Miguel Arteta, Rose Byrne and Tiffany Haddish are childhood friends with big ambitions. And they created their own successful beauty company, Mel and Mia.Tiffany's Mia is the creative while Rose's Mel worries about the bottom line. And it isn't good. So when Salma Hayek's Claire Luna, a beauty mogul, takes an interest in the company, it seems their hard work has finally paid off. And their doubting friends no longer think they're lightweights. But Claire is the Disney villain of the film. And she is bad and she's drawn that way. That's angry carrot, but a little Sophia Lauren to be honest. Salma is way too gorgeous to be a caricature. Claire sees her business as inspiring the ugly people to buy their way to gorgeousness. At least she's honest. Never a truer word spoken by a beauty company.The girls eventually accept the offer of their debts being paid off and keeping 51% of their company. But if they fall out and the partnership ends, then Claire Luna takes their 51%. Of course that is never going to happen as Mel and Mia have each other's backs.But Claire is determined that she will win control of Mel and Mia. She had a partner too when she started, but she soon got rid of her. And she plays the girls off each other and pitches them up against Ryan Hansen and Jimmy O. Yang. Two straight guys who have their own company called Get Some. Both are in the forthcoming Fantasy Island (are they a double act?), and have wildly different views on beauty to the girls. But they are actually very good on stage and women do want to look hot.Billy Porter was great as mixicologist Barrett, with beauty assistant Jennifer Coolidge's Sydney, like Mia, having the measure of Claire. I enjoyed the beauty side and the friendship of the film and a couple of women near me were roaring with laughter as they ploughed their way through their own weight of snacks, so a great one for a raunchy date with the girls.I really enjoyed Tiffany Haddish in recent drama, The Kitchen, her first dramatic role, but also in Girls Night Out. I think like horror, comedy is very difficult to get right. Bad Boys For Life did it well recently. But you could see that everyone involved was trying to get this one right. And although it didn't always come off there were some moments, including a spectacularly bad birthing cake that horrified me as much as Mel and Mia. But it's no What Women Want with Taraji P. Henson. That was a laugh out loud funny movie for women. And if at times it felt a little like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, then just wait for the returning Friend punchline.",Like a Boss

All of those too are targeted towards a female audience, but I enjoyed them in their own right as they were funny and well made comedies.This is just looking to capitalize on those kinds of movie and make a quick buck in January. It's extremely unfunny and really predictable. My girlfriend, who was the reason I saw this, usually enjoys movies in this similar wheelhouse, but even she ended up not liking it all that much either. All of the leads deserve better and have done better.The only jokes that got a laugh out of me was one about Calliou and one involving Billy Porter's dramatic exit from a dinner. Everything else is just really forced moments and not funny. Salma Hayek is playing a cartoon villain that just doesn't fit in a movie like this either. She is only a few steps away from a cackling villain on a Saturday morning cartoon.The plot in a comedy doesn't have to be much if the jokes carry it, but this plot was just really plain and boring. The two leads sell their company to Hayek. Eventually the two of them fight and split for a few scenes, then come to the realization they still need each other.

What I would have liked to see is to have her and Jennifer Coolidge as the leads, going through a mid-life crisis and creating a business as a new journey for both of them. There is a nice contrast between Salma's physical, expressive comedy and the somewhat thoughtful and reserved way Jennifer acts. Had Rose Byrne been cast as the head of the established cosmetic house it could have created some interesting generational situations.While Billy Porter isn't going to win any Oscars soon, he does have a presence in this movie which made me think that he and Tiffany could have also played the leads to better effect.The two guys in the rival ""Get Some"" cosmetic house could have easily been sassy and obnoxious in that Youtube influencer way instead of the dopey frat boys as they were portrayed.Overall, there was a lot of potential in this.

This is the type of movie you put on as background noise on a plane ride when there is nothing better to watch.As I have already stated the acting was nothing amazing. Although I did enjoy Rose Byrne's performance as Mel Carter. She had a few funny scenes that, in my opinion, carried the whole movie.The storyline had good potential but I feel as though it could have been executed better.

86,nickijjohnson-16955,I love Rose Byrne but why Rose Byrne for This?,6,16 January 2020,I don't exactly know what people were expecting from this movie. Has it been done before? Yes. Done better? Yes. To name a couple I'll say Bridesmaids and Romy and Michelle's H.S reunion (irony is Kudrow makes an appearance in this). That doesn't make it a bad movie. It's a female buddy comedy nothing more nothing less. My problem was casting Rose Byrne. I thought maybe it'd be the perfect comic duo you wouldn't think would work but would turn out to be great. Unfortunately it wasn't and it's strange to me. Rose does pretty good in the realm of comedy. Neighbors 1&2. Bridesmaids. Spy. But for some reason she fell flat in this. It felt as if Tiffany Haddish carried this film. Not too sure of a Rose replacement. Maybe Anna Faris? Isla Fisher? Needed more energy to match Tiffany. Billy Porter should've had a bigger part and almost anyone could've played Selma's character. I wouldn't have minded some flashbacks Romy and Michelle style to further develop their characters but not too bad. Still a good girls night out flick to me.,Like a Boss

Like a boss is a movie about two female entrepreneurs who have been working together their whole life and how they were nearly ripped apart by Salma Hayek, and her evil plan to rip apart female entrepreneurs who are friends, because she was ripped apart from her female entrepreneur friend (later revealed, spoiler alert to be none other than Phoebe buffet from friends. Lisa Kudrow.)That's about it for the review of the movie. I enjoyed the part where the women kept smoking joints and got in trouble for smoking joints at their friend's house. It was also great to see the dislike thrown upon these single working women from their married pregnant friends. And then the way that dislike quickly morphed into jealousy, later on, when the girls were going through trouble. It's a decent movie, the plot could have been better. It could have made more sense and been more straightforward but it's the slam together gobbly goo that they came up with. at least they didn't force any unnecessary romance on the characters, instead, mainly focusing on the business relationship, and the friendship.

Tiffany & Rose play Mia & Mel in this funny comedy about friendship. Mia & Mel have been friends for 20 years and now own their own business together. They work together and they also live together in the home that Mia's mom left them after she passed.The situation: Mia & Mel's beauty shop has a very popular product that Mia thinks is floating their business but to only find out later down the line that Mel has been hiding just how far behind in their business they really are. Then, in comes a very, very successful beauty mogul named Claire Luna, played by Salma Hayek, who would like to purchase their business and get the two besties out of debt. What would you do if a rich businesswoman you admire offers to buy your company and erase your debt? Sounds like a plan, right?Mel thinks so when Claire offers her and Mel an offer to buy 49% of their company. Mia is suspicious from the beginning but they go for it anyway, in the name of friendship. The girls don't know that Claire has an ulterior motive to take their entire company and the rest of the movie plays out the shenanigans that happen when friends are not totally honest with one another!The overall energy of the movie is light and funny. There are a few honorable mentions in regards to supporting characters. Billy Porter, who plays an employee of Mia & Mel, has one of the most memorable scenes in the whole movie. And, actress Natasha Rothwell (from HBO's 'Insecure'), brought her acting A-game to every scene she was in. Don't go see this movie thinking you are about to have an intellectual experience that will have you thinking about the undertones of the movie for weeks after!

177,laureng-19692,I want my time back,2,6 January 2021,"For a ""comedy,"" this movie made me sad. It's a sad waste of talented actors. Salma Hayeks character was okay, but the costume orange hair and fake contacts just confused me the whole film. And ""Claire Luna's"" relationship with her assistant was an uncomfortable dynamic. All the girlfriends characters had no development, in still not sure what their story really is?
Characters literally appear out of nowhere and disappear as quickly (one night stand and booty call guy). You are left guessing what the hell is going on from scene to scene. It's a giant mess of a movie and sadly not funny. Just awkward. Tiffany Haddish ""Mia"" plays the same foul mouthed character she always does. Granted, sometimes it's funny. Not this time. It's adult themed slapstick comedy. And Rose Byrnes character ""Mel"" starts off promising with the dark sense of humor but then we are "" told"" she's timid and afraid to speak up. I say told, because there is not development to this, it just happens in the next scene. Billy Porters character ""Garrett"" has some redeeming quality. Or maybe I just really like him.
I'm thankful I didn't spend any money on this, but sad I finished watching it. The best part of the movie is the start of the credits when ""Sister"" by K. Flay plays (only for a moment).",Like a Boss

Yeah some was cheesy/predictable but lots was clever and hilarious. and I'm usually very critical. I'm not an easy laugh. I am mystified by these other reviews.

We rented this film because everyone in our party wanted to see a comedy. We all agreed that after 20 minutes of filthy dirty talk that someone who drafted this script thought would be funny was not worth the waste of another minute. Turned it off and went to bed.The female characters trash talked that was not considered funny for mixed company.
