0,kosmasp,Delusions(?),7,31 March 2021,"Do I consider this a great movie? No. Do I think it can be entertaining, especially if you consider the ""competition"" this has when it comes to similar movies? That is a very big yes. So I reckon I am a little bit surprised, but I reckon when people get savvy and snarky and cynical ... I almost want to board their train to be honest.On the other hand, I also have expectatins to fulfill. And those include me being nice to movies from time to time. This being one of those instances. Especially considering that the shy one from Sex and the City is almost the complete opposite in this one ... Quite raunchy role she gets here. It is all in good fun ... if deadly games can be considered good fun that is of course.Try not to take this too seriously and you'll have a good time. All the mayhem and insanity included.",Deadly Illusions
1,Calicodreamin,Snooze,3,19 March 2021,While this tries to be a psychological thriller 'deadly illusions' is a snooze. The acting doesn't feel authentic and there's no chemistry. The storyline is fairly predictable and the brilliant twist falls flat. Characters lacked depth and made it hard to connect to the story. Story was basic and lacked development.,Deadly Illusions
2,cruise01,Horrible.,2,1 July 2021,1 out of 5 stars.Horrible psychological thriller film about a writer having writers block. Hires a nanny to watch over her kids. But when she becomes attracted to her and starts having illusions of whats real or not.Dumb plot that tries to keep you guessing. Even the twist is forgettable. The story feels like a bad lifetime movie. The acting is stale with the cast ensemble. The direction is dumb. And dull. This is one film worth passing.,Deadly Illusions
3,RosanaBotafogo,Favorable...,8,8 May 2021,"I liked the mysterious tone, but the convenient situations are annoying, when it comes to being surprised, quite the opposite, it became predictable in the first third of the film, however adorable, all the atmosphere of romance, exuding sensuality, what a perfect chemistry... Crazy, exhilarating, and Grace's forced but relevant end to the entertainment...",Deadly Illusions
4,alindsay-al,A Truly Awful Cringefest,1,22 March 2021,"Another day in Lockdown and another film to watch, this time it is Deadly Illusions and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an author hire a young babysitter to watch her children, when the two of them start to build a friendship and connection.Main Character
Kristin Davis of Sex and The City fame plays the lead character here and she is just not very good. Her character is really bland and uninteresting with Davis delivering some really cringe worthy dialogue that made her a character that never connected in any way shape or form.Supporting Characters
Greer Grammer plays the young girl that joins as the babysitter and she is also really bad here. She delivers line after line of awful dialogue and she just has some truly bad scenes that makes it hard for you to by anything in the film and the supposed chemistry between her and Davis which is never there. Dermot Mulroney plays Davis' husband in the film and he is literally just phoning it in and just playing the same character he does in every other project he is in. The rest of the cast offer nothing as well and the acting is just really bad.Story
Ever since Fatal Attraction was released, Hollywood has believed they can just churn out similar films for cheap with nothing unique and they are pretty much all bad and this one is no different. This film is laughably bad and throughout it does nothing interesting and then the last act happens and it is is just hilariously ridiculous and makes no sense.Script
The script is terrible, the dialogue is as mentioned above cringe. With drama, humour and romantic dialogue that are all terrible and the actors deliver it in such ways to make it seem even worse. Then someone wrote the ending of the film and they just had no clue what they were doing and maybe they should move into comedy.Style
The style of the film is awful, the pacing is so slow and literally nothing happens for ages and even when it does it is terrible. Plus this film is way too long, a film like this in 2021 should never be 2 hours long and it just keeps on going.Overall
Overall, this is a truly awful film. Deadly Illusions is one of the worst films of the year so far and is one that should never be seen by anybody.",Deadly Illusions

6,joiningjt,This proves that Netflix makes up the top 10!! This was terrible I mean TERRIBLE!!,1,24 March 2021,"This is 1 of those movies that have absolutely no redeeming value at all, NONE, some of the worst dialogue ever, worst acting ever, and talk about a stupid predictable story done wrong here you go!! I like just about everything heck I've watched some 3.5 movies that I enjoyed its extremely rare I give anything under a 5 but this movie is soooooooo bad!!

9,wisewebwoman,When series are desperately awful....,1,26 March 2021,"And I can't tear my eyes away from the hot mess on screen tearing out my eyeballs, I start to imagine a different script and perhaps the writer's intentions which somewhere along the line got chewed up by the dog or somesuch. So these are my thoughts. I don't think any of the savagery took place except in the author's imagination. Or the sex scenes between the two women. Speaking of sex, what I found alarmingly amusing was Dermot Mulroney diving under the sheets like a seal or a porpoise without one flicker of any kind of sexual excitement. Even the ending, which I won't get into here surely was in her imagination? This was telegraphed way back at the beginning when she talked about the ""episodes"" she has when she is writing her series of bestellers..And the acting was pitiful and the whole thing was very rushed. And the twins were so unequal in size as to lift the eyebrows a lot. Defo one of the worst of 2021 so far. Shame on you Netflix for throwing this garbage on our screens.",Deadly Illusions

11,gianmarcoronconi,Foolish,3,20 July 2021,This film is special because it intrigues and entertains you for much of the film and then shows you a really ugly ending. Besides that most of the twists are trivial and non-trivial ones have no sense.,Deadly Illusions
12,nadkarnisumeet,Kristin shines. Film doesn't.,5,16 April 2021,"Deadly Illusions review :First things first. The only reason I spent two hours of my life on this loophole laden and at times, utterly predictable erotic thriller was only for my fave 'Sex and The City' star Kristin Davis. She plays a middle age novelist going through a writers block and to devote more time on work, hires a young nanny (Greer Grammer) to look after the kids. Not long before she starts sexually fantasizing about her sweet new employee and worse, unable to differentiate if this lesbian liaison is indeed her dream or the real world. Intense, eh?!!..you may ask.Nah, on the contrary, Deadly Illusions is like those typical B movies of Hollywood watched largely for guilt pleasure than anything else. The plot is unreal, the twists are laden with glaring loopholes and the climax (or anti-climax if you could call it that) is a huge let down with some unanswered questions. To put it bluntly, the film just crumbles in the last fifteen minutes. Sad to say this as there was a good concept here which got mauled and killed by inept execution.As for the ever charming Kristin, her performance is the best of the lot and you will actually sit through this muddle of a movie only if you love her. Others can skip it safely!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Deadly Illusions
13,rbrb,The Girls in the Band,8,25 March 2021,"A best seller authoress hires a nanny whilst she attempts to complete her next book.The mental stress and strain of writing the novel takes its' toil on the writer and causes her to suffer illusion or delusion when trying to finish the book.Or maybe she is actually experiencing the truthfulness of her life and her desires whilst at he same time her husband and the nanny are living out their feelings, sane or otherwise too?I loved this film and it had me mostly engrossed throughout.The poor reviews maybe down to the fact than many viewers cannot accept certain kinds of love, in particular within same sex relationships.
That relationship was done brilliantly in the movie.The two female leads vie with each other to steal the show; both are the winners!The ending is mightily thought provoking and shocking but at the same time wholly understandable.8/10.",Deadly Illusions

15,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Absolute trash,1,21 March 2021,"Branded as a psychological thriller, it isn't psychological nor a thriller. The true horror is that this movie occupies space on Netflix servers. Who wrote this crap?",Deadly Illusions
16,Sir_AmirSyarif,"Silly, third-rate 'Basic Instinct'-y thriller",3,19 March 2021,"Mary Morrison is a bestselling author who writes novels about ""passion, sex, lies, betrayal."" In order to focus on writing her next novel, Mary Morrison hires a young, hot nanny to look after her children - and maybe her husband too. It's pretty obvious where this is going.

The big reveal is just insulting and tone deaf. I don't know how two decent-sized stars agreed to do this movie, but I'm glad they did. What a ride.",Deadly Illusions
18,trinaboice,So disappointing,1,20 May 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
I was intrigued to watch this movie because I'm an author and author coach. The film's description says: After a bestselling novelist suffering from writer's block hires a new nanny for her children, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur. It's a psychological, erotic thriller that is so badly executed that I'm giving you fair warning here.THINGS I LIKED:
Fans of Sex and the City will be excited to see Kristin Davis starring in a feature film. Unfortunately, she's not a strong enough actress to save this film. Her character is conflicted in many ways. I thought it was sweet that, as a mom, she had different handshakes to say goodbye to each of her kids when she dropped them off at school.Greer Grammer stars in the movie and also produces it.I liked the original musical soundtrack by Drum & Lace.Every author's writing process is different. In the movie, we see Kristen Davis' character writing her book with pen and paper, rather than on a computer. I have some author clients who do that. We also see her create a storyboard on a big board, a technique I recommend to my clients because it really helps you ""see"" the story develop and allows you to be very intentional where you place certain scenes.Husbands and wives need to be extremely careful in order to protect their marriage from external relationships and impropriety. For example, my husband NEVER drove home our female babysitters. It wasn't that I didn't trust him or our sweet babysitters. Too many crazy things can happen based on what other people think could have happened, you know? It's just not worth it. No, people shouldn't assume or judge, yet they do.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Even the title isn't original. So many books have been written with the same name.I'm surprised that Dermot Mulroney went for this script.Weird and creepy. I mean who takes a complete stranger bra shopping? That's the first scene when you realize the movie is ridiculous and it just gets worse.It's often hard to know what's really happening and what's fantasy. Of course, that's the point because the protagonist can't either. Then again, the execution and writing are so bad that it makes you wonder if the writer and director even knew.There are some really terrible acting moments.There's a terribly cliched flower moment.Lots of exposition.There are twists but they're ridiculous with so many details that don't make sense. We're left with more questions because Act 3 is a complete mess.There were some ""Gollum"" moments that made me laugh out loud. (The psycho hobbit in the Lord of the Rings)TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is NOT appropriate for children. Plus, they'll be bored anyway.You see a married couple rolling around under the sheets. Then later, they do it in a kitchen closet.You see some skin when two best friends are in a spa sauna & shower.A pretty girl wears an immodest bathing suit. You see her in a bra many times.The mom smokes cigars as a symbol of her warped and developing manly obsessions of a young girl.A woman goes skinny dipping in the pool. Later, you see part of her naked chest in a bathtub.Tons of inappropriate sexual illusions.Two women kiss.You see some blood in a murder scene.Some profanity, crude language, and an F-bomb
You see the naked backside of a man in a shower

19,danielmanson,Wow!!! What a bad film,2,27 March 2021,"I'm only giving this a 2/10 because I feel harsh giving it a 1/10 considering literally every review is just that. But my god, this is absolutely awful cinema.The acting is insanely sub par and the first hour especially of this film is exceptionally slow, like I'm genuinely amazed as to how slow a film can be. I've seen disabled slugs move at a quicker rate than this. The film had no direction either, because literally nothing was happening you didn't know/ or care what was to happen next.The ""twist"" was just pointless. You knew it was coming and it was so cliche. Really wasn't inventive whatsoever and really did sum up this entire movie.Since this doesn't spoil anything I can say this. So a big part of this film is the fact she is writing a book and it really zones in on that aspect at times. Several scenes of her writing etc. DOESNT MEAN A DAMN THING. It doesn't change the plot or outcome, it serves absolutely no purpose. Why bother???Genuinely this is just awful. I honestly can't think of a single positive and I'm angry at myself that I watched this. If you are debating it, don't.",Deadly Illusions
20,roxmewild,Paint by numbers would be more entertaining!,1,4 April 2021,If there is one thing I took away from this mess of a so called movie it was the Fact Kristin Davies should have Retired after Sex and the City !She is piss poor in this but then again the whole story script etc is a pile Of Crap!Ps changing the Title of the movie from deadly illusions to Grace does not make it Any better and fools nobody 🙄,Deadly Illusions
21,Mehki_Girl,Love the Whiners,5,19 March 2021,"This movie wasn't that good, but not that bad either. It's pretty clear what's going on. It's in the title - duh.I liked Kristen in Sex and the City, but her bad plastic surgery was distracting.The conservatives whining about the movie would deny racism exists or that they're racist, but somehow always manage to reveal themselves.Every placement of black actors in a movie is somehow PC, but they would be the first to claim they have a black friend.Golly gee, if racism doesn't exist, wouldn't black people exist in every strata of society and be friends with whites? But that's the problem with conservatives they constantly whine and contradict themselves and make zero sense. Black people exist, get over it.Here's a tip, stop watching movies made by Hollywood. Cancel your Netflix subscription. As a matter of fact, just turn off your TV and cancel all streaming services and sit in the dark where minorities, none of whom you're racist against, exist.There, fixed that for you.Tired of reading your whiny, snowflake comments, like there's no off switch on your remotes.",Deadly Illusions
22,jetkot,Too much happens,6,18 March 2021,Psychological thrillers usually keep you at the edge of your seat. This movie does manage a decent plot but the treatment is flawed. A writer suffering from a writer's block and maybe deadly illusions.The performances are decent but when you sit back and join the dots it gets too confusing. They should have focused on one person having a mental illness or someone simply being a villain. They instead choose to tease and titillate you in the first half and do too many things in the second half and the end result is an average thriller with an ambiguous ending.,Deadly Illusions

24,msunando,"Leaves too much open to interpretation, thus losing the plot",4,23 March 2021,"Deadly Illusions starts off on a high note with Mary Morrison (Kristin Davis), a successful bestselling author looking for a caregiver for her two children while she reserves her time for a new novel, with a lucrative offer on the cards. She announces that when she writes, she transforms into someone she herself cannot control, and therefore without a nanny, her children will face neglect. Her husband Tom (Dermot Mulroney) is a busy executive too, and both are delighted with Grace (Greer Grammer), a young girl who opts for the job and is an instant hit with the kids.Grace however, is more than a handful as she starts to take control over the household, enters a passionate and steamy relationship with Mary and even seduces Tom. The sudden murder of Elaine, Mary's closest friend, suddenly wakes Mary out of her stupor as Grace is a suspect. Mary soon discovers that Grace wasn't sent by the agency she had contracted for hiring the nanny and that she is a known patient of split personality and bipolar disorder. In the meanwhile, Grace attacks Tom viciously at home and leaves him bleeding profusely. Mary is able to save Tom, but Grace is sent to a mental rehabilitation center that Mary visits often. She is also able to complete her new novel that she dedicates to Elaine, whose murder remains shrouded in mystery.Deadly Illusions meanders midway and loses direction completely before pressing the accelerator again towards the finishing line rather abruptly. It leaves many loose ends in need of being tied and also has a rather underwhelming climax, open to interpretation much more than anticipated. As such, it is a rather insipid outing with oodles of opportunities lost in the procedure. Performances are listless too, as no sympathy gathers for anyone concerned.",Deadly Illusions
25,gustheaffen,Really bad - aging actors desperate for some air time,1,24 March 2021,"This movie is so laughable, a bad Lifetime TV movie on Netflix. The first half is a soft porn fest with the nanny, very weird and awkward, with lots of bad sexual facial expressions. You can obviously tell it is a set-up. The twist that she has multiple personalities that switch back and forth - that isn't how mental illness works. One of them is deranged but super savvy enough to outsmart older successful people. Seriously, do these aging mid 50s plus actors need money this badly?! And really the marriage is fine after both these cheating liars get the deranged woman out of their life?!

The husband shows off his ass. Could do without that. There is the token black friend. The acting from the nanny was unbelievable. She acts like shes 14 years old. Kristin mouth is odd.

It has one of those forced endings that come out of nowhere, don't really make sense and seem detached from the beginning.

No extravagance is spared with set, wardrobe, or vehicles, but script and acting falls flat onto its face in that mouse gray space between Lifetime Movie Network (with more nudity) and Cinemax After Hours (with less nudity). A slack, pathologically unimaginative, non-Hitchcockian snoozer of the lowest order. Greer Grammer fortunately doesn't take after her father in the looks department, as she is the only fresh, fetching face you'll find here; unfortunately she doesn't take after him in the acting department either. She seems overly surprised, like she was just goosed, in most scenes. Sapphic picnic in the dead, khaki weeds by a river. A punctured tire wheezes. Lazy framing. Why? An inconsequential child plays a quick flute solo and fails to propel the plot. San Francisco in a Santa Fe soap bubble? Several grotesque shots of a somnolent, snake-skinned Kristin Davis (who plays a monosyllabic writer?!) smoking cigars. Why? Speaking of gross, Shameless Dermot Mulroney (I'm constantly confusing him with Dylan McDermott, though the latter can act some) gets some impromptu, much needed liposuction in one of the unintentionally funnier scenes. There is no mystery, everything is telegraphed and spoiled early on. Like who didn't know the killer would be female after a good scissoring? Shanola Hampton (also of Shameless fame) is the only actor who decided to show up. At least she knows shoot from, well, Shinola! Netflix hits a new nadir.

While I was writing that I was thinking: ""I haven't seen Music or Deadly Illusions, so maybe it's not the worst?"" So, I gave one of these a try and immediately regretted it. This is far below a bad movie. This is an awful movie. The story has no clue what it wants to be. The acting is below mediocre. I laughed out loud multiple times about how bad the performances are. The dialog is not good. Its cliché stuff and so on the nose that it hurts. Also, the technical aspects are so annoying. Why are there so many cross-fades? And was the audio doing to this poor actress voice in the end? The only reasons I'm not going below a one star, is because it kept me mildly intrigued. It kept me interested enough to not turn it off. But that third act oh my god. The ending is so badly executed that I wanted to get drunk, so I could forget it as fast as possible.

Some parts of this film reminded me of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.
Sadly, there's no real substance in this film to really gather momentum or the viewers attention. The only time it got abit interesting was after Elaine , Mary's best friend was murdered. The story and acting picks up a little then. Overall, this film was too long, when it didn't need to be. The acting wasn't all that good either, the plot was way too over stretched and the story line and script was quite boring.
I think maybe this film tried to use too many ideas and story lines, that ruined it. Like other reviews parts of the story resembled other films.

137,FeathersFromage,Why did these actors do this project?,2,28 March 2021,"This is a miserable failure. The only two reasons I think Dulmot Mulroney. Kristin Davis and Shanola Hampton would have ever done this is either they loved the idea of duality in horror (who doesn't?) or they made some pact with the devil in exchange for their talents. The script was really bad. I knew right away it was not going to be a solid pick, since the pacing almost felt like a Lifetime holiday film on a bad acid trip. The three listed above did their best with what they were given, especially Mulroney, but man, the direction and those horrible lines! Not to mention the plot holes were crater-sized and many of the characters' actions were implausible to anyone with common sense...and I have quite an imagination and can still not see anything like this going down in any circumstances. What was with the bra shopping? ""Oh, hi, I am your brand new boss, but I am going to take you bra shopping and GO IN THE DRESSING ROOM WITH YOU."" Such a natural unfolding of events we have all experienced at sometime, amirite? Some other highlights include twin kids that look completely different ages, horrible acting by some secondary actors, a psychiatric disorder many doctors deny exist and a storyline that defies logic in any universe. I mean, where did the extra bike come from? If she ""hadn't done this in a long time"" (as in, riding a bike), why did she have a brand new adult bike just sitting around ready for them to go on a long, sensual ride to the lake (where they had a full spread with wine yet no character was seen going or coming back with any supplies)? It's little things like that, over and over again that just makes the viewer wish they had bowel problems so they could take a bathroom break to avoid another scene. Just don't watch it. It will make you depressed that actors like these are taking on projects like this. I was debating a 1, but gave it a 2 since you do get to see Mulroney's bare ass and that is never disagreeable as far as I am concerned. But someone's going to be up for a Razzie for this excrement and it will be well deserved. I wish Netflix refunded money for things they say are ""#3 watched in the nation"" but suck this bad.

156,Fairbrit,In someone else's hands it could have been so much better,6,20 March 2021,"The story, had it been executed by an accomplished director, could have been amazing. My take on this is that Mary has an alter ego. All the books she has written before are violent and this perhaps is her outlet to remain *normal* on the outside. But since we are seeing everything from Mary's POV we have to ultimately conclude that there IS NO GRACE. Mary is Grace. Through creating this character, a younger version of Mary who possibly was abused as a child herself, she is able to break free from her writer's block and function as a person. The end scene is confusing. She is wearing the same headscarf and coat that was seen on footage of the woman who slashed the throat of Mary's best friend, Elaine. So who is that person leaving the hospital after visiting Grace? I am not sure why the director left us guessing like this. I am also uncomfortable when mental illness is used as a vector to spread disinformation about people who suffer mentally. In the 1960s there was a film TWISTED NERVE that had an insane man commit gross murders. But he happened to have a younger brother with Downs Syndrome. The film alluded to the fact that this murderer had a damaged gene in his family. And Downs Syndrome was the connection. This is lazy and sloppy. I think Deadly Illusions fell into the same trap.

For now, I'm going to assume the ending is predictable and lame. The first 1 hour and 45 minutes is, so I don't see why that would suddenly change.
In summary it's essentially a modern day remake of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, an early 90's film that was good for its time. They've altered some aspects to modernise it, like make the live-in babysitters obsession with the mother become sexual, in addition to it being sexual with the husband. But otherwise it wanders no further from the hackneyed plot of ""obsessed outsider infiltrates and ruins family"".
It's one of those films that I think people in the industry still think they're right when they have meetings around tables and say things to each other like ""We're gonna show people how wealthy this family is because people love seeing opulence!"" When in actual fact that approach is dated and considered very unrelatable these days.
It kind of attempts to make you wonder whether the main female character or the babysitter character is the one causing the problems. But it just comes across as muddled and unclear. You get what might be flashbacks, might be memories, or visions from the main character of both herself and the babysitter doing terrible things, because apparently she ""gets very dark"" when she's writing... yawn. She gets so dark she randomly goes completely mental, dropping the f-bomb at the dining room table in front of her kids, after no hint whatsoever that she was about to lose the plot. And everyone reacts... as if it's fairly normal.
Sadly this film suffers far too much from those annoying experiences viewers have, such as saying to him/herself ""You wouldn't do that / say that."" Or ""Why did she do / say that?"" many times throughout the film.
Ultimately, it bears little resemblance to normal people and normal everyday life, which is a shame because it's a straight up drama based on earth in 2021...",Deadly Illusions

This movie barely if at all let who you know the characters which I understand isn't really developed fully in a movie, but this just barely scrapped the surface of anything that would want to keep you engaged. You don't even have to focus on this movie, more like slow background noise where half the movie was kind of silent. This is actually a reason I never got into watching movies, it's 1 1/2 - 3 hours of a forced plot, sometimes okay or even good, but there most the time seems as if writing these plot lines, even the writer would be best to serve his time doing something else. The acting was cringe worthy, awkward, and the part that bothered me the most was when they were having dinner, random scene again, and she told Grace basically I thought you said you didn't intrude on family time, but then Starr's screaming about her husband and Grace sleeping together, but yet the husband sat there as if he were gaslighting her as well. I mean so your telling me a couple who has a good marriage, has a nanny show up and she is sleeping with husband and wife for them to never know. And yet she got the nanny to cook, clean, and watch the kids but yet the nanny is hardly ever with them, she's what, giving massages by the pool or in the bath, and creeping about in a very drifting away movie.

Which to be fair isn't exactly something you want from a thriller.The real problems start about half way in, the writing takes a dramatic turn to the pathetic, with awful dialogue and shocking twist that was never really grounded in anything. It's around here where the acting really starts to drop off as well, it turns from a Riverdale quality film to a 2002 Disney channel, straight-to-TV quality film. The more absurd the plot gets they more the actors seem to with draw from their roles, like they really just don't care about putting the effort in anymore. The main actresses performances in particular go from good to desperately bad. From an action point no of the hits have impact, even the really violent scene are just so uneventful and you don't have much reason to care for the characters.In the end, the exploitative portrayal of dissociative identity disorder and the inclusion of a child abuse plot, which closely resembles the Turpin case to an uncomfortable degree, were the final nail in the coffin for this film.

In the end it is revealed that Grace is traumatized and therefore ""of course"" becomes an insane killer. I am genuinely angry that mental illnesses like schizophrenia and DID keep getting portrayed like something that makes a person dangerous. This kind of ""person ends up hurting others""-stuff happens extremely rarely and people who suffer from these mental conditions will probably feel extremely uncomfortable about discussing them because WELL MOVIES LIKE THIS. Using mental illnesses and the incredibly misinformed stereotypes surrounding them as a way to make money is just plain stupid, especially when a movie where these would be corrected would most likely create a much better, well, movie.Also, the movie made it look like she was able to control her transformations, which is ridiculous, it's not like an on/off-switch you press. It happens through triggers. And she seemed to be able to hide the other personality of hers which, once again is completely unrealistic.The ending was confusing and the point where she walks out of the hospital is in my opinion completely unnecessary. I doubt anyone liked that part simply because it was such an obvious ""mysterious ending oooo"".

476,julietkurtz,One of the Worst Movies I Have Watched,1,20 March 2021,"This movie has to be one of the worst I have ever watched. The plot itself sounded promising, but the execution is awful. First of all, both the acting and script are cringeworthy. The script contains dialogue that no one would say in real life. Next, the plot contains major holes. Grace's motivations for killing off the family are never revealed, besides the fact that she says she is ""insane."" Also, the children are absent for the majority of the movie when Grace was hired to be their caregiver. Lastly, my major bone to pick with this movie is its portrayal of DID, previously known as split personality. This movie further perpetuates the stereotypes associated with DID and continues to stigmatize the mental health disorder. The movie continues the harmful narrative that individuals with DID are ""crazy"" and prone to violent outbursts. In conclusion, not only does this movie contain terrible acting, cringeworthy dialogue, major plot holes, but it continues to demonize a real mental health disorder.",Deadly Illusions
477,domarbat,New account just to rate this: it's a comedy not a thriller,1,20 March 2021,"This movie is sooooooo dumb .... but sooooo dumb that you will be dumber after finishing it by for example accepting or processing illogical facts like the nanny can be in your room while you are dressing to then casually ask her for help, and here you are for 11000 times telling yourself ""ok let's suppose that this is possible"" . This movie is stupid I almost broke the tv when the husband said ""there are only your fingerprints on the knife used on the bike"" Does he have a fingerprint analyst at home because how does he know? Why did he test that knife? When? So man questions.
Once again netflix top ranking sets me up. But this time I created my account here just to save other people. Actually ... the movie will be great if it was described as a COMEDY. Everything was ridiculous from the acting to the plot . And even if she was just crazy and grace never existed it is still very poorly expressed in the movie, and it will be more like you are forcing yourself to believe that to somehow give a little sense to the movie because never, you have a hint that she is grace. Let's suppose (again) that Grace was never there, Elaine was her psy ok but why Elaine will ask her to be careful because grace will steal her husband if she was grace? Is it not more important for her psy to focus on her not losing herself than an affair between her second personality and her husband? And why is she not in prison then one year later for killing Elaine? I mean this is what happen when you overthink on a bad and stupid movie. I wish I never watched it",Deadly Illusions

The movie creators could have easily just made grace a manipulative killer, not someone with multiple personalities talking to herself back and forth with an evil personality that want to kill them. It's ungodly cringey and probably offensive to people. (That's not how DID works btw but sure let's just add to the stigma and misunderstanding of the disorder all together) Not only did they make Grace a character with DID, but for some reason also her aunt too?? Ok??Literally the only thing it adds to the plot is when Mary goes to visit her in a psychiatric facility, out of pity I presume. Only to be murdered and stripped of her clothing so Grace can wear them out of the building and escape. Which if the producer's were absolutely NEEDING that to be the end of the movie and couldn't possibly have it any other way, it could've easily been done without her having multiple personalities.In conclusion: Stupid, Boring, Uncomfortable Sexual Dynamic, Cliche, Slightly Offensive, and Poorly Done",Deadly Illusions

I knew this movie would suck immediately - the opening dialogue is the classic ""we have no idea how to write a plot point"" so they just have a character (that you never see again) say ""You're *this person*, you're a writer, you sold out, you're a bad person because x/y/z..."" At that moment I knew I was in trouble. It's amazing that a movie can be almost 2 hours long and lack any actual character development and avoid moving the story forward whatsoever. Here is the entire movie:
1. Movie opens and has a character explains who Kristin Davis is because they have no idea how to reveal it normally. 2. Husband ""makes a bad trade"" that you never know anything about and it's implied he loses half their money, though they are rich. You never see a lifestyle change or anything else come of this. This is revealed in a 2 minute scene on their patio and it's just over. 3. Kristin Davis has to write a new book now so she interviews nannies for a while until Greer Grammer shows up and gets the job. She spends the entire movie shopping and doing weird activities with the parents who never seem to spend any time with their kids. 4. Davis spends the whole movie telling everyone how ""weird"" she gets when she writes and you're not supposed to be able to tell if she's going crazy or if her affairs with Grammer are real or not. 5. Davis magically finds a family member of Greer two hours away and gets a dumb little traumatic backstory out of nowhere. 6. Davis' best friend is murdered, they think Davis did it but she can't be sure because she's sO cRaZy WhEn ShE WrItEs. 7. Greer is mentally ill and tries to murder the couple and locks the kids in a bedroom. 8. Davis wins the fight and Greer gets sent to an institution, but they're still friends and Davis visits her.

This is nothing against the actress but how the producer chose to display ""mental illness and/or trauma"" in a ""haunted shizophreniac"" way.

There is no real babysitter as such. It's herself, the mother who will not have enough time for her kids. That's why the babysitter is such a clean type, called Grace, her age sometimes 20 but sometimes 40. She also is the main character of her new book. Things get messy. Keys to understand are scattered around in the movie, but it just never becomes clear for most viewers. The note about her illness, the slit wheel, her visit to Grace's schizophrenic relative etc. It would have been a more helpful ending to understand, if at the end she would visited 'Grace', they would played cards but looking into the room we would only have seen Mary.

I've seen worse movies and just click away without needing to rate it up or down. It wasn't just a formula film, it wasn't from Sundance but it is good. Just the very, very bad babysitter genre, one thinks, yet that's merely the surface framework. The writer stresses out over competing priorities when she has to work. Hence, her strong reluctance to consider writing again and refusal of book deal offers. She's really into to raising her kids, enjoying her wonderful family wants to put all that first. Unexpected occurrences lead her to cave-in to the pushy publishing agents and accept new work. The psychological hell of all the suspicions and doubts about hiring the perfect and pretty young nanny begin to arise. The low reveiwers, (not unlike anyone who falls unawares into mentally troubled waters) are titalated yet frustrated, just don't follow the pure, wordless dipiction of descent into mental illness. So one star givers, Get over it. And the film is perfectly fine for what it is, easy on the eyes, not escapist fare. An enjoyable, though predictable film that one should watch knowing that stylistically it's very, very obtuse, which isn't going to gain great acclaim. Not typical hollywood, but along with nice sets, great cinematography it's fine to spend an hour with if you're not doing anything else.

It was obvious from the start that something psychologically abnormal was going on there and there were hints at the mother being the killer which was twisted otherwise in the end, that was cute.

701,cdshanken,"Please, for both of our sakes, do not, under no circumstances, watch this movie!",1,21 March 2021,"I am not a savage critic, nor do I write reviews that often, but not only did this movie make no sense, it was so disgustingly awful that I would rather sit in the DMW for one week straight in the middle of the desert with no food or water than watch this movie again. The fact that it is #2 in the US right now makes me want to vomit.",Deadly Illusions
702,heathera-46091,😑,1,7 April 2021,"It's seriously THE worst movie I've ever seen. Nonsensical plot, terrible acting and a complete waste of time. There was absolutely nothing believable about this movie at all.",Deadly Illusions
703,mattyd22222222,Just..... wow,1,23 March 2021,The reviews are correct. They're all correct. This is bad. Really bad. Mind numbing bad. Just.....bad. You should watch it just so you can see how bad it is. Bad. Bad bad bad. BAD.,Deadly Illusions
704,mbyrne-01444,Skip this one,1,20 March 2021,All I can say is Mulroney and Kristin Davis must really be hurting for money to have taken this movie on. Save yourself... skip this one!,Deadly Illusions
705,liferightnah,Possibly the worst movie of 2021,1,18 March 2021,"This movie is so bad, I'd rather watch Kanye West talking about himself for 10 hours straight",Deadly Illusions
706,stephanienoel-35766,Awful.,1,21 March 2021,"I guess if you enjoy watching terrible movies with really bad acting and a story line that makes no goddamn sense, you'll enjoy this movie but if not, you're going to have a bad time. This movie starts off okay but just gets so ... bad and cringe worthy until the very end. I wouldn't waste my time with this pile of trash if I were paid to do it.",Deadly Illusions
707,pdaug,Complete Cliché rip off,3,25 March 2021,"How this is a top title on Netflix idk. I like Dermot M's other moves so figured this was going to be solid. Not so much. Story lines lifted from other movies and their idea of a plot ""twist"" is weak and cliché.",Deadly Illusions
708,jonathandavid-79123,Not as bad as the sheep think....,6,23 March 2021,"People love to bash everything these days and movies are just another thing people like to seem clever about. This film by no means is an academy award winner but it is entertaining and fun in its short comings. It's a straight to Netflix film, what did you expect??!! The only real problem with this film is the fact that it's so over the top at times you start to believe the main character is actually writing the events taking place in her new writing project. When you realize it's actually what's taking place, that is when your let down but in a very fun ""made for TV movie"" kind of way. If you like smutty films this one is excellent and does not disappoint. Kristen David looks amazing and the Nanny does a great job creating steamy action. All in all enjoyed this film except for the fact that it could have been so much more if the writers actually believed in what they were making!! Fun watch.... enjoy!! Forget the haters!!",Deadly Illusions

710,joanesy,Really should be able to give zero stars,1,19 March 2021,Terrible. Just terrible. The writing was laughable. So many plot points that never come together. Watch Hand that Rocks the Cradle instead.,Deadly Illusions
711,alanmh-63867,Viewer beware,3,28 March 2021,"This had the potential to be a good movie, but... Who enjoys losing two hours of their life watching a movie, only to have it end and you're left wondering what happened. What was real and what was imagined? Too many questions and I don't think it is fair that anyone puts this type of movie out there.",Deadly Illusions
712,abdulkara,Movie interpretation.,2,20 March 2021,It's a terrible movie. Waste of time. The arrangement is not satisfactory. There are cliché sequences. Script quality is poor. Nothing in the name of directing.,Deadly Illusions
713,meghajyasala,🤢🤢,1,21 March 2021,"Can i get my time back or help me unsee it.
So bad that even ppl who worked on this film wasted their time to produce such piece of 💩.
