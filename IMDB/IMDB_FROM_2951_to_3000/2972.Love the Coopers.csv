0,bkoganbing,Max's dog's eye view,7,1 September 2018,"This is one quirky Christmas movie about a large and extended family named 
Cooper, four generations of them gather for Christmas dinner and the whole
proceeding is viewed by the family pooch Max whose voice is that of Steve Martin.
A gambit going all the way back to Jackie Cooper's TV series People's Choice.John Goodman and Diane Keaton are the Cooper parents and there's a ton of
kids and grandkids. there and expecting. All bring their little problems and 
angsts to mommy and daddy as if Goodman and Keaton don't have enough of
their own.Standing out is young Timothee Chalamet who comes across like a real kid in
this as opposed to a Hollywood kid. Tim is one of their grandkids dealing with
both hormonal pangs and a bully and not doing well with either.Love The Coopers is a fine, but different kind of Yuletide film.",Love the Coopers
1,SnoopyStyle,"hate the narration, mix-bag for the family",5,25 August 2016,"It's Christmas Eve and the Coopers are gathering for a family dinner. Sam (John Goodman) and Charlotte (Diane Keaton) are fighting after a long marriage. Their son Hank (Ed Helms) lost his job and is struggling to get his kids gifts. Emma (Marisa Tomei) has always been jealous and bitter at her sister Charlotte. She tries to steal a broach and is arrested by Officer Williams (Anthony Mackie). Sam and Charlotte pick up Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) from the retirement home. Charlotte's father Bucky (Alan Arkin) keeps eating at a diner for the companionship of waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried) and definitely not for the food. Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) hates to be the disappointment to her mother Charlotte and picks up military Joe (Jake Lacy) at an airport bar.This is a rather standard PG dysfunctional family Christmas. There is some good and some less-than-good from the talented cast. Wilde and Lacy are the most fun and their formulaic rom-com works well. Goodman and Keaton's fighting is a little annoying. Keaton has played this character a lot and this is not her best. Helms plays the pathetic guy. It's not the most endearing performance. I expected more back story from Arkin and Seyfried. There should be a bigger reason why he keeps going to the diner to see her. All in all, this is a functional dysfunctional family fare with a few minor problems. The one problem that keeps distracting from the story is Steve Martin's narration. Both the narrations and the flashbacks keep disrupting the flow. The narration's reveal do not help either. It's a gimmick that is too cheesy to spoil. The standard material and good cast should be good enough for a passable movie except for the disruptive narrations.",Love the Coopers
2,kosmasp,It's the movie to be jolly,7,18 January 2017,"A festive movie about family, about values, about love and everything else. With a little twist at the end if you want to call it that. Other than that it is pretty much by the numbers (predictable that is). But it's a fun movie to watch and it's lovely to see another story about family interactions.If you like that kind of stuff that is. But it's light (drama included of course) and it's fun overall. The acting talent at hand is amazing and it's clear they're having a blast. I guess watching it around Christmas time makes the most sense, but you could also watch it anytime else and still have that good feeling",Love the Coopers
3,zardoz-13,More Holiday Day Sneers Than Cheers,5,16 November 2015,"The fair to middling Yuletide yarn ""Love the Coopers,"" about a dysfunctional family and their dog during a snowy Christmas in Pittsburgh, wrecks the halls rather than decks them. Like ""The Family Stone"" and Thanksgiving themed ""Home for the Holidays,"" this outing depicts the various trials and tribulations that four generations of a family face as they assemble for their ritualistic Christmas Eve dinner. ""Corrina, Corrina"" director Jessie Nelson and ""Stepmom"" scenarist Steven Rogers supply soap opera rather than holiday hilarity in this contrived PG-13 rated hokum that shares more in common with a Lifetime movie than a Hallmark movie. Literally, everybody in ""Love the Coopers"" is concealing something, lying about something, and/or hating somebody else. A top-drawer ensemble cast that shouldn't be squandering its considerable talents for such a contrived exercise in tedium makes this bittersweet potboiler more tolerable than it has any right. Diane Keaton and John Goodman play the long-suffering couple that sponsors this disastrous dinner. Keaton appears in her element as a Martha Stewart housewife who has more than enough time to lavish on this supper. After all, she appeared in the similarly minded ""Family Stone."" For a change, heavyset John Goodman looms front and center as her husband for a change rather than as an eccentric bystander on the periphery. Goodman's presence reminds us that not all Hollywood husbands need look either trim and slim like Michael Douglas or charismatic like Brad Pitt. Naturally, obstacles galore ensue as the various couples encounter the problems in their lives and struggle to triumph over them. No matter how robust the cast is, everybody is inevitably upstaged by a large mixed breed dog named Rags that steals the show in the final frame with the surprise of all surprises. Charlotte (Diane Keaton of ""Anne Hall"") and Sam Cooper (John Goodman of ""The Big Lebowski"") have been married for 40 years. They have a grown-up son, Hank (Ed Helms of ""The Hangover""), with a family of his own, while their adult daughter, Eleanor (ravishing Olivia Wilde of ""Cowboys and Aliens""), has found neither love nor success as a playwright. Eleanor has just flown back home, and she is loitering at the local airport terminal because she doesn't want to face her folks. Eleanor and her mom rub each other the wrong way, and the former doesn't approve of the patronizing way the latter treats her. Eleanor is beginning to feel the burden of being single. Since her fiancée cheated on her, she has been leery of the opposite sex, but she still craves affection. At the airport, she comes across a soldier on leave, Charlie (Jake Lacy of ""Obvious Child""), whose flight has been grounded because of inclement weather. Eleanor and Jake have a series of encounters and eventually get chummy. Rather than face her mom as a single daughter, Eleanor invites Jake to accompany her to her parents' holiday dinner and masquerade as her fiancé. Charlotte's widowed father, Bucky (Alan Arkin of ""Argo""), has retired and frequents a local diner where he has developed a platonic friendship with a young waitress, Ruby (Amanda Seyfried of ""Momma Mia""), who may have tried to slash her wrist at some time in the past. Bucky has been cultivating Ruby's appreciation of movies with Hollywood classics like Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" and the Judy Holliday comedy ""Born Yesterday."" Meantime, an even more obnoxious character lingers on the sidelines in the person of Charlotte's jealous younger sister Emma (Oscar winner Marisa Tomei of ""My Cousin Vinny"") who has always clashed with her sister. Emma remains single and self-absorbed. She carries drama around with her like luggage.Conventional as this set-up appears with the meal as the finale, more is going on than initially than meets the eye. Charlotte and Sam plan to use the Christmas dinner to announce their imminent divorce. Director Jessie Nelson and scenarist Steven Rogers hint, but never outright explain what prompted Charlotte and Sam's martial meltdown. Mind you, we catch a glimpse of their adorable second daughter who didn't survive infancy. Presumably, her demise has taken a toll on Charlotte's life and ruined her happiness. Sam wants to embark on a trip to Africa with her that they had planned decades ago. Sadly, Charlotte has forsaken her adventurous spirit. Meantime, Hank and his estranged wife Angie (Alex Borstein of ""Ted"") squabble about their three children, a lusty teenage son named Charlie (Timothée Chalamet of ""Interstellar""), his younger brother Bo (Maxwell Simkins of ""And So It Goes""), and their 5-year old sister, Madison (newcomer Blake Baumgartner) who spouts the crude phrase ""You're such a dick."" Of course, Madison provides the comic relief because everybody is appalled by her tactless diction. Furthermore, Hank has been replaced as a Sears' portrait photographer by automation. Worse, he hasn't informed anybody that he is no longer employed! Aside from Eleanor's antics, Emma faces the worst predicament of her life. She swallows a brooch at a jewelry store, and the store detective nabs her. Pittsburgh policeman, Officer Williams (Anthony Mackie of ""Marvels' Avengers""), claps Emma in cuffs and transports her to jail. During the drive, Emma bonds with Officer Williams, and he reveals that not only is he gay, but he also is terribly lonely. Eventually, the Cooper dinner turns into a family feud. Everybody is at each other's throats when suddenly Bucky collapses from a stroke. The family rushes their paterfamilias to the emergency room. Fortunately, Bucky doesn't kick the bucket, and the family manages to resolve their differences.Virtually every character in ""Love the Coopers"" is objectionable. Moreover, the filmmakers have given us too many characters to keep track of and furnished too few details about some. The biggest surprise is that ""Love the Coopers"" is narrated from the perspective of Charlotte and Sam's Saint Bernard named Rags. Although it is a clever conceit, no dog could know as much as this omniscient narrator knows. Holiday movies are a dime-a-dozen, but ""Love the Coopers"" isn't worth a dime.",Love the Coopers
4,oscaralbert,It's as if someone decided to mash together . . .,9,16 November 2015,". . . A CHR!STMAS STORY and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, improving upon both of these holiday classics is some respects. Polls show that 38% of Americans hate CHR!STMAS STORY because ""Ralphie's"" incessant voice-over narration reminds them too much of someone they smacked in the nose at recess during their primary school days. LOVE THE COOPERS fixes this problem by attributing its equally continuous narration by Steve Martin to Rags, the Coopers' family dog. (No one recalls punching their pooch in the Snozzle.) IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE can be criticized for Yoyoing between funny (""Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight?"") and sad (""Quit plunking that infernal piano, Zuzu!"") parts. Audiences do not know whether to laugh or cry. Despite its carefully-edited trailer implying that LOVE THE COOPERS is a Christmas comedy, it's actually a poignantly bittersweet tear-jerker that elicited audible sobbing from start to finish at my theater. (Half the COOPER preview seems to be stitched together from out-takes; consisting of the moments usually reserved for DVD blooper reels.) Though Rags may not come off here smelling like a rose, he's the one consistent model of the Holiday Spirit.",Love the Coopers
5,neil-476,Likability compensates for predictability,7,4 December 2015,"Charlotte and Sam are preparing for a family Christmas in the knowledge that their 40-year marriage will be ending soon afterwards. And all their family members - Charlotte's sister, their 3 adult children, and Dad – have relationship issues of one sort or another, all of which come home to roost in one way or another over Christmas.This is a multi-thread feelgood comedy/drama. It has an excellent cast, headed by Diane Keaton and John Goodman, all of whom give pleasing performances in a film which, to be brutal, is predictable and trite. But to criticise it on that basis alone is to ignore its virtues. It is often genuinely amusing, and it is equally often moderately moving especially if you are of an age where the issues faced by Charlotte and Sam have a resonance for you personally. And these are nice people. It is enjoyable spending time in their company. And, if the feelgood ending is a little glib, what of it? It's Christmas, for heaven's sake!Bob Dylan fans: note that there are half a dozen Dylan songs on the soundtrack.",Love the Coopers
6,anaconda-40658,I Don't Love the Cooper.,3,6 January 2016,"Love the Coopers (2015): Dir: Jesse Nelson / Cast: Diane Keaton, John Goodman, Ed Helms, Alan Arkin, Olivia Wilde: Uncomfortably awkward and boring Christmas comedy that branches off into several subplots. It is suppose to represent the nature of family but instead it is just one major embarrassing blow to the careers of everyone involved. John Goodman and Diane Keaton play this bickering couple who have been together for some thirty or forty years. Apparently Goodman wants to go to Africa on a trip and wants Keaton to join him because it is a trip that was but aside decades ago because they had a family. Watching these two actors yell at each other over this senseless bullshit is like witnessing their careers crumbling down. Ed Helms plays their son and his story is that he lost his job as a photographer at the mall and is looking for work. He and his wife split but still have children to further disappoint. To further add insult Helms has this idiotic snort that fails to render him anything other than a travesty to this film. Alan Arkin plays the grandfather who goes to a restaurant everyday to chat up this young waitress, played by Amanda Seyfried. This is kind of creepy and his affection for her is a tad confusing, however this is not likely a role that Arkin wishes to be remembered for. Finally we have Olivia Wilde as the daughter arriving home only to pick up a soldier at a bar. She continues to bore him with her complaints about family and dating before she convinces him to pretend to be her boyfriend. This film aims for family unity over trials but ultimately leaves viewers not exactly loving the Coopers. Score: 3 / 10",Love the Coopers
7,StevePulaski,Sometimes I wish we skipped from October to January for the sake of our emotional health,4,13 November 2015,"I thought that the November film to get American audiences in the spirit for the holidays was a Hollywood convention that has recently gone by the wayside. With films like 2008's ""Four Christmases"" and 2013's double whammy of ""The Best Man Holiday"" and ""Black Nativity,"" I thought that Hollywood had traded in the cookie-cutter, family-is-everything films for franchise Christmas titles, but apparently, the presence of ""Love the Coopers,"" a film that tries to get us to don our gay apparel early in the month of November, proves me wrong. Despite boasting an incredible ensemble of performers, the film falls prey to the worst conventions of holiday films, as it becomes so invested with cheap pathos, dimestore morals, and downright atrocious narration that it temporarily redirects your anger from premature, non-denominational Starbucks cups and Christmas radio stations before Thanksgiving to the prevalence of rehashed trite now playing in a theater near you.The film follows four generations of the Cooper family, who are set to gather for the holidays, despite slumping marriages, separating unions, and troubled states of nearly everyone who is attending Christmas dinner. The patriarch and matriarch of the family are Sam and Charlotte (John Goodman and Diane Keaton), who have been married for forty years and are finding themselves in a sea of uncertainty. With that, their children are the single and lonely Eleanor (Olivia Wilde), who coerced a stranger (Jake Lacy) she met at a bar to pose as her longtime boyfriend and the recently fired Hank (Ed Helms), who worked as a family photographer, and is now undergoing a rather hasty divorce amidst finding a new job. Also invited to the festivities are Charlotte's father Bucky (Alan Arkin), his close friend and waitress at his favorite diner Ruby (Amanda Seyfried), who's purpose in the film is questionable at best, Sam's squirrley Aunt Fishy (June Squibb), and Charlotte's unmarried, jealous sister Emma (Marisa Tomei), who is picked up for shoplifting by a police officer (Anthony Mackie), whom she manages to get to confess his true feelings while she is handcuffed in the back of his cruiser.Before having all of these people occupy one frame, we see their daily lives for the first hour of the film, which, as you can imagine, results in a massive amount of story lines to juggle at once. When anthologies and vignette-style films are smoothly structured and developed, it makes you forget you're watching a film with so many characters (Adam Rifkin's ""Look,"" while more of a drama, is a much better example). It also makes you forget what you're watching is, essentially, an inherently choppy film with several elements of disjointedness. ""Love the Coopers"" makes the common mistakes of flooding us with too many characters to get to know and care about, and too many scenes that transition from bathroom humor to mawkish morality within a minute or two.Then there's the problem of there being too many characters and too many plot-strands running with one another and trying to hold the same equitable emotional weight and screen time, rendering ""Love the Coopers"" less as a film and more a competition of characters. Olivia Wilde and Jake Lacy's storyline alone probably would've made for a likable film, ending with the same conclusion of a large family gathering of her character's parents, but the film chooses to deviate from her enough to focus on too many perspectives at once.""Love the Coopers"" is also guilty of giving A-list actors C-list material. There's no reason stellar supporting performers like John Goodman and June Squibb, whose wonderful work in ""Nebraska"" has gone from being an Oscar-nominated laugh riot to her being cast as a senile punching bag, need to be gifted with the kind of material most beginning actors would find themselves hard-pressed to accept on the grounds of sheer idiocy. It's sad that so few films, particularly hybrids of both comedy and drama, that boast these amazing casts cannot live up to the sheer magnitude of their star power.With all this and more, throw in some horrible narration that doesn't justify itself and its pervasive hamfisting of depressingly common morals until the conclusion of the film, and you have ""Love the Coopers,"" the kind of that makes you wish we skipped right from October to January for the sake of our emotional health.",Love the Coopers
8,Hellmant,"It doesn't deserve such a talented cast, or director!",6,12 February 2016,"'LOVE THE COOPERS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A Christmas family/rom-com flick; about four generations of a dysfunctional family, getting together for the holidays. The film stars an all-star cast; which includes Diane Keaton, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Olivia Wilde, Jake Lacey, Marisa Tomei, Ed Helms, Amanda Seyfried, June Squibb, Anthony Mackie and the voice of Steve Martin (narrating the story). It was directed by Jessie Nelson (who's also helmed other family drama flicks; like 'I AM SAM' and 'CORRINA, CORRINA'), and it was written by Steven Rogers. The movie is definitely nothing new, or clever, but it is nicely directed, and acted. The film takes place on Christmas Eve; with four generations of the Cooper family, all getting together for Christmas dinner. Each family member has their own problems, and drama, with other members of the family. Each relative, of course, also discovers the true meaning of Christmas; throughout their adventurous mishaps. Most, are also involved in some sort of complicated romance.The film is cheesy, and routine, and it doesn't deserve such a talented cast. Still, it has them; and they deliver. I especially like Olivia Wilde and Jake Lacy (in the movie), and their 'odd couple romance' storyline. The directing is also a lot better than the script deserves. It's not that funny, but the romantic scenes (and touching family moments) actually work. The film is a decent family Christmas flick, I'd say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/CoUgbXLzKSQ",Love the Coopers
9,ThomasDrufke,Is this an attempt at a comedy?,5,15 November 2015,"When you have a cast that this film does, it's hard not to get excited. I mean you have Olivia Wilde, Diane Keaton, Marisa Tomei, John Goodman, Amanda Seyfried, and Alan Arkin to mention a few? Yeah I'm in. But with a cast this large, you run the risk of a film feeling overcrowded and discombobulated. While the film has its moments with some of the great cast members, it ultimately ends up feeling really convoluted and to be honest, stupid.This film was marketed as a family comedy/drama, but by no means is this a funny movie. Every single joke falls flat. I'm serious every single joke. There are as many cringe worthy jokes/moments as there are Christmas trees. So if I'm judging this as a comedy, it's a complete fail. But the reality is, there are some promising side story lines here. So if this were a TV show, then they would be able to fix it and focus on the interesting characters for the upcoming episodes, but it's not a TV show. So I understand where everyone is coming from when I hear all the hate for this movie. I'm not defending it, I'm simply saying there are some redeemable qualities to this film.For example, I thought Olivia Wilde and Alan Arkin were actually really good in this film. Pretty much every story line is about finding love or regaining the love you had, and the only one I believed were Wilde and Arkin. So I wish this film focused more on those side stories instead of a 4 generation family coming together for Christmas. I didn't hate watching this film, I just don't think I'll ever watch it again.+Wilde+Arkin-Not funny at all-Messy messy story-Who is this targeted at?5.0/10",Love the Coopers
10,inkblot11,"Lionsgate, what a big heart you have! Thanks for an early Christmas present that is just right!",8,2 December 2015,"Charlotte Cooper (Diane Keaton) and Sam C (John Goodman) have been married for 40 years. Long ago, they made a promise to take a trip to Africa together, when they were erstwhile hippies. Now, its many moons since and no trip. This has angered Sam to the point of divorce, for he believes Charlotte has lost her way. Yet, since its Christmas Eve, they have agreed to NOT tell the family of any potential split until after the holidays are over. In comes family. Daughter Ellie (Olivia Wilde) a playwright, still cant get over a broken engagement. She is currently involved with a married man. However, she meets a military man at the airport who, despite being on the verge of going overseas, she converses with easily. Its a surprise. Meanwhile, Charlotte's sister (Marisa Tomei), a single lady who has always been jealous of her older sis, gets caught shoplifting a small pin and may spend the holiday in jail. Also, Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is heartbroken that the waitress he feels close to (Amanda Seyfried) may be moving out of town. Finally, the Coopers son (Ed Helm) has had a tough year. He lost his job and goes on endless interviews while he and his wife split, leaving him with shared custody of three kids and a feeling of hopelessness. The family doesn't know. While Charlotte and Sam shop, take care of their granddaughter and bicker, it may be impossible to keep their ""secret"" from their loved ones. Will they have a peaceful Christmas or will pandemonium prevail? Is romance in the air for any of these folk? This lovely Christmas film is a heart warming tale of familial love. Yes, we sometimes hurt those we care about and we also hide our flaws when we celebrate a holiday, but love does conquer all. The actors here, from Keaton and Goodman on down, are just wonderful. Diane helped produce the film so I give her a double wide thank you! Then, too, the movie is told through the eyes of dog Rags (Steve Martin), who is a total delight. The setting in Pittsburgh is snowy and grand while the costumes, tender script and fine direction that generated the best of performances need compliments, too. All in all, you will Love the Coopers, yes, you.",Love the Coopers
11,cosmo_tiger,There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. Mainly because it is just so much fluff and very formulaic.,5,8 February 2016,"""No matter what happens, we are all family."" Once again its Christmas Eve and Charlotte (Keaton) and Sam (Goodman) are getting ready to host their family. When four generations come together nothing ever goes smooth. What seems like hosting and attending a simple dinner becomes an adventure for everyone involved and lives and loves are begun, tested, and ended. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. Mainly because it is just so much fluff and very formulaic. On the other hand, it was pretty much what I was expecting. This is a movie with the same feel as It's Complicated, Something's Gotta Give, Big Wedding, and other movies like that. This is a type of movie you can just pop in and relax as you watch. Not having to think or stress about. Those are good sometimes, but those aspects do not necessarily make a good movie. Overall, fluff and pretty much a cookie cutter movie that some people may like and some will hate, I was pretty much indifferent and when it was over my thought was...well, that's over. I give this a C.",Love the Coopers
12,vincentlynch-moonoi,What a mess,5,3 February 2017,"This isn't the weirdest movie I ever saw, but it's high on the list. Although, weird doesn't necessarily mean bad. But, in this case, weird is kinda bad. This is a sort of ensemble-type film, and you either like or don't like some of the individual subplots.Sub-plot 1: John Goodman and Diane Keaton are planning on divorcing, with the precipitating factor being her refusal to go on a long-planned trip to Africa with him. But they want to have one last ""regular"" Christmas before they tell their family. This subplot is fine, although with age I think that Keaton has slightly lost her touch, and I never thought Goodman had the touch. As a result, while the subplot is fine, I wasn't that impressed with the acting in it.Sam and Charlotte are divorcing after forty years of marriage. Charlotte convinces Sam to wait until after their grown children (Hank and Eleanor), grandchildren (Hank's kids Charlie, Bo and Madison), Charlotte's father and sister (Bucky and Emma) and Sam's aunt (Fishy) have enjoyed one last ""perfect Christmas"" before announcing the planned divorce. As scenes shift back and forth across the Cooper family members, their memories also briefly appear on screen as younger versions of themselves.Subplot 2: Hank lost his photography job and his wife has left him, though she has flown in for the holiday Christmas. This just didn't work for me. Too much hand-wringing.Subplot 3: Eleanor has flown in for the holiday, but stays at the airport as long as possible because she dreads going home...although it was never clear to me why she dreaded it. The motherly nagging was pretty minor. At an airport bar she meets a soldier snowed in at the airport...even though there's not that much of a snowfall. They hit it off, though they are very different people. He agrees to act as her boyfriend for Christmas so that her mother will lay off the nagging. I didn't find Eleanor a very sympathetic character, although this part of the story was SOMETIMES intriguing.Subplot 4: Bucky -- the grandfather -- is eats daily at a local diner because he so admires a young waitress who hasn't gotten her life together. It's sort of charming, but I was never quite clear what his intentions were. Good...or a dirty old man? This was, at least, an interesting subplot.Subplot 5: The high school boy, awkward as can be, has a crush on a girl. They finally get together, but their Frenching and humping in public is illogical and disgusting.Subplot 6: Emma (sister to Keaton) gets arrested for shoplifting during Christmas shopping. She is arrested by a police officer played by Anthony Mackie. In the police car they get into a conversation in which the officer admits (sort of) that he is gay and that his personal life is a disaster. Okay. That sorta works...except Mackie is only a prop here because he lets her go because it's Christmas. Unfortunately, for Mackie, it's a dead end part.Finally it's Christmas dinner...and it's disastrous, resulting in an unexplained power failure during which Bucky suffers a stroke (yes, really). At the hospital they all kiss...well, dance and make up.Honestly, this film stinks, but has just enough good scenes that I couldn't turn it off. Perhaps most interesting is that the story is told by the dog (I'm not kidding), with voice portrayed by Steve Martin.To be honest, don't waste your time.",Love the Coopers
13,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,2,12 January 2019,"It is not a myth that movies with all star cast are flops. This one proves it once again, though it tries harder to present a deeper understanding of the characters and the holidays. The Coopers are trying to present a jolly image for the christmas holidays, that aims to cover their real probelms. If the story had followed one or two characters, than it would have been an actually decent movie. However, they meddled with too many plots and leads to follow and it ended up a half baked mess. So, 2 out of 10.",Love the Coopers
14,leonblackwood,Predictable and not that funny! 2/10,2,15 January 2017,"Review: I wasn't a big fan of this movie because I got fed up with the constant moaning from the various characters, who really had nothing to moan about. Its based around a dysfunctional family, who are getting together for Christmas at the family home but the mother and father of the family, Sam Cooper (John Goodman) and Charlotte (Diane Keaton) are having problems with there marriage, because they have grown apart since the kids have left home. Charlotte's sister, Emma (Marisa Tomei) is jealous of her sisters huge family, and she is caught stealing a present for her, whilst shopping in a department store. Officer Williams (Anthony Mackie) has to chaperone her to the local police station but after bonding in the police car, he decides to take her to the family home. Meanwhile, Charlotte's daughter, Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) becomes friends with a soldier, Joe (Jake Lacy) whilst drinking at the airport bar, and she manages to convince him to act like he is her boyfriend, so her prying mother will stop going on about how disappointed she is with her life. Charlotte's father, Bucky (Alan Arkin) falls for a waitress, Ruby (Amanda Seyfried), who makes him feel young and has the same interests as her but he doesn't make it known to Ruby, mainly because of the age difference. He asks her to come to the family home for Christmas, as she has decided to leave her job to pursue her dream. Charlotte's son, Hank (Ed Helms) is going through a divorce to Angie (Alex Borstein), so he is constantly searching for a job to support his kids. With Sam's senile Auntie, Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) and the family dog Rags (voiced by Steve Martin), also around the family dinner table at Christmas, all hell breaks lose when they finally get together, and Bucky takes a turn for the worse, which eventually brings the family together. I really did try to get into this film but the storyline was weak and the characters wasn't that interesting. The script also became a bit annoying, especially between Keaton and Goodman who were arguing about complete rubbish, and the witty side of the movie wasn't that funny. With such an impressive cast, I was totally let down with this film but I'm sure that dysfunctional families will enjoy it. Disappointing! Round-Up: This movie was directed by Jessie Nelson, who also brought you I Am Sam starring Sean Penn and Corrina, Corrina with Ray Liotta. She also wrote and produced Fred Claus, Because I Said So, The Story of Us, Stepmom and Danny Collins. Although I didn't really find this movie that interesting, it did make a profit at the box office, mainly because it was released close to Christmas. I couldn't see were the budget went, and I personally think that the director didn't take full advantage of the cast but on a good note, it does have a sweet ending, which was quite predictable.Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $42.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies, starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, John Goodman, Ed Helms, Alex Borstein, Amanda Seyfried, Alan Arkin, Dan Amboyer, Marisa Tomei, Olivia Wilde, Anthony Mackie and June Squibb. 2/10",Love the Coopers
15,Ed-Shullivan,"There is dysfunction in all families, the IMDB reviewer naysayers are in denial about their own families skeleton's in their closets",7,10 January 2021,"This is by no means a drama, nor a comedy, but I classify it as a dramedy about real life issues. Family members argue. Family members are sometimes uncomfortable around each other. Husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, have ups and downs in their relationships. All families remember good times and bad times and so do the Coopers.This is not a warm and fuzzy feel good movie that you finish seeing and you are left with an uplifting feeling of happiness . What you will see is a point of view as if you are sitting at the Cooper's dinner table yourself and as hard as you might try to avoid it, you will consciously take a side with one family member over another.This film has an all star cast and the family and spouses interactions are sometimes intense but honest in their current feelings towards each other. I especially enjoyed all of the scenes between Alan Arkin the Cooper family patriarch and his waitress actress Amanda Seyfried which take place at his favorite diner.There are too many scenes throughout this film to mention them all but Olivia Wilde and the war veteran she meets at the airport actor Jake Lacey evolved quickly as each of them dug deep into the others psyche, and I wished there was more that we could have listened in on.I will be sure to watch this again sometime as it is one of those memorable films, not in a good way, but it may help remind us all to forgive, not forget, but to share our feelings and whatever the outcome the truth should come out. I give this dramedy a 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",Love the Coopers
16,matthewssilverhammer,I Don't Even LIKE The Coopers,1,21 November 2015,"At one point, a character in Love the Coopers says to another, ""I think you're funny 'cuz you're sad.""

Unfortunately, like the movie itself, that quote never plays out as true, and the overbearing sadness never plays out as funny. In one of the most abrasive Christmas films ever made, the message (""Your family is irredeemable and Christmas is a fraud, but what can you do?"") makes this movie a snide, depressing burden. This unnaturally overwhelming pessimism is so draining, 20 minutes in I was looking for a way out, something I never do (I sat all the way through Pixels, for crying out loud). Alas, I stayed, only to be slaughtered with dialogue and character interactions that were nowhere near being true to anything in reality. I spent the majority of the runtime asking myself questions like: What are the ages of these ill-cast actors? Why is Steve Martin (or anyone, really) narrating this thing, when everything seems pretty clear without it? Why are the cop and his arrestee, who just met, having a heart-to-heart? Why does everyone in the family seem to enjoy watching each other make out? Justwhy?! If there was something positive to say about The Coopers, I would say it. However, this is a special kind of awful; a comedy that elicits laughs, but less of the ""with"" kind and more of the ""at"" kind. In the end, I was shocked I didn't just reach into the screen, grab an icicle, and violently poke my eyes out. So do I Love the Coopers? NopeI don't even like 'em.",Love the Coopers

Not because it's so campy and filled with family holiday spirit that's too sweet and cheesy. It's because it's dull and boring like a ginger bread cookie without the sugar.It feels so Empty. a lot of stuff is going on with this ensemble cast of the Cooper family as they dread the holiday season due to everyone's personal issues, and while everyone gets a fair shot of screen time, there is no emotion behind it at all. I was hoping that the chemistry between John Goodman and Dianne Keaton as the center of the Cooper family clan would be good for some great moments, but the two actors seem to have no chemistry between them. This kinda goes for everyone in the movie.I did have a few laughs and giggles here and there but not enough to make this uneventful movie worth checking out.",Love the Coopers

It is a comedy but it is also a drama. In other words, it's not JUST a comedy. John and Diane are a married couple-40 years together-that are having their annual family Christmas get together for the whole family. Only problem is, it's a dysfunctional family. John and Diane are contemplating getting a divorce but Diane wants to wait until after one last celebration before breaking the bad news to everyone. Alan is the grandpa that spends his days at a local diner-he hates the food there- just so he can see Amanda. There is a little age difference between them but she reminds him of his youth and he enjoys her company. Olivia is one of John and Diane's kids and Olivia has to lie to them about her relationship status-there is no one in her life-because she doesn't want her parents to be disappointed in her. Like I said, it is a comedy but not just a comedy. The cast is good and the family dog narrates the movie. FYI: Listen closely to the dog's voice and see if you can tell that it's Steve Martin. It's rated ""PG-13"" for thematic elements, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. If you are the type of person that likes a little different in your Christmas movies, you might like this one. Otherwise, it would be a good rental.",Love the Coopers
20,mattkratz,good holiday film,8,20 January 2017,"This was a decent holiday/family comedy film following several story lines. Among them were scenes with Dianne Wiest and John Goodman, Marisa Tomei being arrested for shoplifting, Amanda Seyfried about to quit her job at a diner (much to the chagrin of her favorite customer), and one of the daughters picking up a soldier at the airport so she can pass him off as her ""lover"" for her family for the family at the dinner. The whole thing is narrated by Steve Martin-you might be surprised by who his character is. My favorite scenes are John Goodman messing up the lyrics to the Christmas scenes;Seyfried's scenes at the diner;the scenes in the police car;and the scenes between Olivia Wilde and the soldier.

I loved the ensemble cast. I'm a big fan of most of the actors. Marisa Tomei, Diane Keaton, Olivia Wilde, John Goodman, and others all star as members of the Cooper family. They all give very good performances, I especially loved Olivia Wilde's performance. I loved her storyline with her and her man she met on the way to meet her family. The chemistry between the two is electric, I liked the dialogue between the two, it was both funny at times and sweet and touching. And I also liked following the other family members stories and the script allows for the audience to get invested in the characters and see deep into why they are the way they are. I thought that Marisa Tomei and her storyline with the police officer was very interesting and it really gave a look into her character. Keaton and goodman are great together and I loved their story and seeing them go through what they were going through. Overall love the coopers isn't out of this world, but it is a sweet fun way to spend a couple hours, especially over Christmastime. 7/10 for love the coopers.",Love the Coopers
22,aidanratesmovies,It's like if Love Actually had a very depressed jealous step-sibling,1,16 November 2021,"An incredibly depressing, pointless, and overly sentimental piece of horses***, Love the Coopers is just about one of the worst Holiday films i've ever seen, and certainly the most disappointing. What the hell were they thinking making this movie? First off the cast is excellent, and it could have easily been so much fun, but each performance is overrun with rundown Hallmark like written characters and just an overwhelming bomb of sadness and nostalgia- it's honestly intolerable to watch anybody try and show any emotion on screen. Ed Helms, Amanda Seyfried, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Diane Keaton, Marisa Tomei, Timothee Chalamet, Olivia Wilde, and Steve Martin- and still this is just about the worst Holiday centered movie i've ever seen- you think at least one of them would have been able to show the audience a good time. Despite its dreadful performances, overwrought writing, and incredible misuse of potential- the film is also extremely dull and hard to follow along. You won't care about any of the characters or their problems here, and never have I wanted a film to end so badly. The story is also incredibly predictable at times, and at others, just incredibly pointless- to the point that you truly scratch your head and wonder what they were thinking and why they did the things they did to begin with. The only credit I can possibly give this movie is that it somehow came out in some sort of narrative fashion, cause honestly it's a god awful mess, and I can't see how anyone was able to make sense of whatever the hell was going on in this film, let alone trying to set the right tone for it. In the end, Love the Coopers is an absolute disaster- easily one of the worst christmas films ever made, and goes down in history for me as the absolute worst misuse of a stellar cast i've ever seen.My Rating: 1/10.",Love the Coopers

24,rgkarim,"Funny, Realistic, and A Long-Winded ""Christmas"" Tale",6,21 November 2015,"Better late than never I always say! Hi I'm Robbie K and this review is on a comedy designed to be a holiday treat for the bunch. The name of the movie is Love the Coopers, which from the trailers looked to be packed with stars who were ready to make you bust a gut with lots of laughs. Of coursewe do know that multiple big names in one movie often leads to disaster in terms of quality and plot (Valentine's Day and New Years Eve anyone?). Anyway, let's get started on the review. For a comedy, Love the Coopers has a bit more wit involved in terms of making you laugh. By wit I don't mean the dry comedy that you have to be in the loop to understand, but more so in how well it is integrated into the story. The dialogue happens naturally, flowing into the normal routine instead of shoving a comedic ploy into our faces. In addition the variety of the jokes helped keep the movie fresh and fun, ranging from sexual innuendos and first time kisses to insults and the art of lying. Even better was how all of these jokes fit into place and worked with the individual's story to further maximize the timing. And yet I think all of it would have failed had it not been for the actor's delivery. Whether it was John Goodman's sarcasm, Olivia Wilde's angst and attitude, or June Squibb playing the clueless aunt it all was maximized by how well they sold the lines. Or in some cases it might have just been a facial expression that got me laughing, primarily from Rags the dog who continues to take the drama and roll with it in some way.So strong comedy must mean good story right? Wrong! Love the Coopers' plot was very lacking in entertainment for this reviewer. As I feared, the tale was very fragmented with multiple mini-plot lines slowly converging until they all meet in the end. This tactic has worked in the past, but like most modern comedies, they lack balance. Some of these plot lines are strong, taking constant screen time and establishing the backbone. Others however would have their 15 minutes of fame and then not be seen for some time, often hastily concluded with the reunion of plot lines. Fortunately it's all wrapped in a nice Christmas package, however untraditional it is. This isn't the run of the mill, feel good movie that you see on Hallmark though, but instead one that uses the Holiday as a means for character evaluation. Love the Coopers is actually a downer, especially at the beginning where all the problems come to light. Thus with the poor plot and depressing tone, I felt this movie dragged at a lot of the parts, making the 107 minutes feel more like 180 minutes. I'll admit I nearly nodded off a few times as well, so that might be something to take to mind. No surpriseeverything comes full circle in the end and you'll get some grand lessons if you keep your mind open, but it certainly isn't the most moving piece I've seen. As I mentioned earlier, the actors really are the strongest part of this movie. John Goodman was my particular favorite as the big man continues to impress me with his wide spectrum of characters. He's funny, serious, and keeps the stories tethered together and plays exactly like the stereotypical head of the household. Diane Keaton unfortunately was not in my favor this time not so much for her acting, but that her character was so annoying. She's a good counter to Goodman's calmness and a great source of drama, but it was a little too much for me. Olivia Wilde steps back in the light with a decent role that combines sexuality with mischief and uses her gorgeous looks to complete the character. Ed Helms is a little more down to Earth in this film, trading in overacted arrogance and stupidity for a more believable character. It was nice getting to see a more serious side of things, and helps add a bit of awkwardness to an otherwise cut and dry family. Alan Arkin is great as always, though underutilized in my opinion and would have been great to have a few more quips and lessons to add to the mix. Heck even the kids impressed me with how fitting their characters were taking components of a Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, and a Hallmark kid and wrapping it into one. And Steve Martin as the narrator added a nice tree topper, fitting right in line with the various narrators of classic Christmas stories. Love the Coopers is an okay film, but certainly isn't your run of the mill Christmas tale. Sure the comedy was a nice variation, and the acting certainly made the characters alive and relevant. Unfortunately this movie was just too monotonous, long-winded and depressing to make this movie fully entertaining. I'm sure you can guess from my review that this movie really isn't worth the trip to the theater, not only due to lack of entertainment but also a lack of special effects. Therefore this reviewer recommends skipping this movie at the time and finding an alternative to this movie. My scores for this film are:Comedy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Love the Coopers
25,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Love the Coopers,6,18 November 2015,"Love the Coopers (my latest review) might be the strangest, most offbeat holiday film I've seen in many a moon. Its director Jessie Nelson, shoots 107 minutes that include innumerable close-ups (of her actors), split screens, jittery camera-work, and clips of high schoolers french kissing (badly I might add). There's Bob Dylan tunes in the background, a wealth of fake snow, Steve Martin narration lifted straight from the vehicle Little Children (don't ask), and even the sound of June Squibb farting (ugh). So is this thing a comedy as exhibited by its clichéd- minded trailer? Not entirely. A sad drama that might deceive you is more like it. Is this a panoramic, sort of blackballed, ensemble piece that the late Robert Altman would have rejected? Oh you know it. 2003 had Love Actually, ""Coopers"" has ""actual"" begrudging.Produced by the same guy responsible for 2005's The Family Stone (Michael London) and taking place near Pittsburgh, PA, Love the Coopers chronicles the dysfunctional descendants of the same name. You have Charlotte Cooper (played by Diane Keaton), a mother of two and a grandmother of three. Her wish is to have all of her kin together for one Christmas Eve. She invites everyone over by sending them snow globes as gifts. This includes her daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde), her son Hank (Ed Helms), her father Bucky (Alan Arkin), and her sister Emma (Marisa Tomei). Charlotte is married to Sam Cooper (John Goodman) but they are on the verge of a separation. Hank, well he's already divorced with some kids. Eleanor isn't in a relationship yet chooses to mess around with a married doctor (she also brings home a stranger from the armed forces to pose as her boyfriend). Finally, Emma is completely alone while having a knack for stealing expensive jewelry.Now each persona just mentioned, has a plot point. The film shifts back and forth with their vignettes until everyone meets (in the same location) for dinner, gifts, and acoustic, Xmas singalongs. At the Cooper family feast, you have the obligatory bickering and the obligatory shouting. Someone falls into the jello with a mild stroke, the dog of the household eats off many a plate, and every immediate family member (plus any anonymous invitee) dances together in relegated jubilee. In bits and pieces, Love the Coopers reminded me of Nothing Like the Holidays circa 2008. The only difference being that ""Coopers"" is more Americanized and there's no petrified tree waiting to be chopped down in the front yard.In retrospect, I went into Love the Coopers thinking it was gonna be another Family Stone. I'm glad I was wrong. I'm in the minority when I say that I really loathed that flick. It had pretentious characters in manipulatively forced situations. With ""Coopers"", there's less of that stuff. You have a deeper tonality taking place. Sure Jessie Nelson doesn't always know where to put the camera and sure, she presents every cast member's conflict (and overlapping story) only to abruptly bring happiness to fruition. Alas, her film still has a certain amount of appeal. With beautiful images of Christmas nosh, sparkly lacerations of decorations/lights, and a whole lot of cheery, caroling going on, this is a walking, Hallmark card of a movie. I can see hardcore, holiday aficionados watching it for its gaze, a Christmassy look that would give anyone their fuzzy-wuzzy, yuletide fix. Rating: A strong two and a half stars.",Love the Coopers
26,rannynm,Fantastic dramady about dysfunctional families and holidays.,9,18 November 2015,"I saw this with my husband and daughter in law and we all just howled. It reminds me of Nora Ephron film with all the family and personal drama going on. There is a bit of profanity and sexuality so I wouldn't take your younger kids but, for teens it's a go. It has a great ensemble cast, each with his or her own personal drama going on. Diane Keaton and John Goodman (who has lost a ton of weight and looks great) make a very believable couple whose kids and grandkids are all slightly off kilter. Steve Martin, who narrates the film through the eyes of the family dog, is a delight. And, the love story between Angie and Sergeant is one of the highlights of the film. ""I never believed in love at first sight until now."" As Leo Tolstoy said, ""All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" But, you might just see an element of your own family in this film.",Love the Coopers
27,eric262003,A Holiday Turkey You Can Stuff It,2,20 December 2016,"Why does a holiday movie have to be so complex that you have to jot down notes to get a better understanding of what's being thrown at us? The worst case is that even after all that note taking there's not a single element that's even the most noteworthy. That's what I felt after watching ""Love the Coopers"", a film that delves into the lives of a dysfunctional family during the holiday season, but we end up lost in the shuffle of characters without proper introduction and the details about them are virtually non-existent. Director Jessie Nelson and screenwriter Steven Rogers plaster on underfed events juxtaposed with tiring levels of slapstick. However as the film unfolds we learn less about the characters and the film just settles on making them very unlikable.It's Christmastime at the Cooper clan and the parents San and Charlotte (John Goodman and Diane Keaton) are facing marital problems after 40 years of marriage. To contribute to their marital problems they still manage to bring up the subject of an incident that happened 30 years ago. Daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) refuses to go home for the holidays and befriends an army soldier named Joe (Jake Lacey), but she uses him as a scapegoat to get her mother off her back. Son Hank (Ed Helms) has problems in his hand as he's going through a nasty divorce while also facing unemployment while he reminisces about his days working at a department store. Charlotte's much younger sister, Emma (Marisa Tomei) has been arrested on account of kleptomania while becoming very chatty with a cop (Anthony Mackie). Finally grandfather Bucky (Alan Arkin) is quite passionate with a diner waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried) and is heartbroken that she's quitting her job in search for other endevours.With an ensemble cast, we were hoping to get a decent introduction with the characters, but in the end, we never really know the characters and all the dramatic tensions just envelop without even a warning from its audience. It seems that each family member is used as a unintentional plot twist to keep us guessing which is all right for a mystery film, but not a film intended as a holiday themed film. For the next 100 minutes of this movie, we are forced to guess who's who and this warm, friendly holiday film is anything but warm or friendly. Even the script has us left in limbo like they describe Ruby as a Cooper, but she's a character outside the family. Much the same goes to Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) and the family dog Rags (Steve Martin) who's only purpose in this movie is to look cute and used as a decoy for an occasional fart joke to those who love potty humour.""Love the Coopers"" isn't hard to decipher, but the script is very opaque from the lacking character development to the forceful efforts in adding some fantasy towards the story as each character reflects upon their past triumphs and failures. Everything about this film feels randomized from unconventional characters getting more screen time to more prominent ones being shut out like an afterthought and to comic timing virtually non-existent. Sure Nelson provides the angst and uncertainties of the holiday season, to illustrate that the holidays does not always bring out the best in everyone, but in the end the film is very labouring and vague it feels like this film lasted longer than the duration that the editing was too rushed and way too obvious.It was the first time in 15 years that Nelson directed a film, the classic ""I Am Sam"", and I can the rust in her in this film. The acting was very awkward, the score was sloppily done by Nick Urata and the whole Christmas prone visuals can be quite painfully overdone. The overall feeling of the movie is more sugary than two dozen boxes of Christmas cookies and Steve Martin's voicing the inner thoughts of Rags the dog was completely wasted since he's a character of little thought let alone importance. The human emotions are meagre combined with scenes that feel more a sitcom than a movie and very limited family interaction, this holiday film is the definitive lump of cold black coal. In the end this movie has nothing to love about the Coopers and doesn't know what it wants to be or how to celebrate the holidays. This is one turkey you can stuff it.",Love the Coopers
28,Matt_Layden,Do Not Love The Coopers.,4,3 January 2017,"I went and saw the film, The Family Stone, in theatres when it first came out. It received mixed reviews, but for the most part, I really liked it. It dealt with a dysfunctional family getting together for the holidays. What made it work, in my mind at least, was that the characters felt honest, the chemistry between the cast felt real and despite the many dramatic moments, it had some heart. Love The Coopers is a poor imitation of these things. I bring up The Family Stone as a apt comparison, not only because Diane Keaton is the matriarch, but because both films try to convey the same message. The Family Stone's shortcomings happens in the final act with the girlfriend ""switcheroo"" whereas Love The Coopers shortcomings is the entire film.The film follows one family and their stories on Christmas Day. Keaton and her husband, John Goodman, are having one more family get together before they ultimately decide to leave each other after 40 years of marriage...depressing. Ed Helms is the son, separated from his wife, unemployed and feeling less of a man and even lesser of a father...depressing. Then we have Alan Arkin, the grandfather, who eats at the same diner everyday just to have a conversation with the pretty waitress, Amanda Seyfried, and to convince her she has value in this world....depressing. The beautiful Olivia Wilde plays the daughter. She is on her way home and is wasting time at the airport so she can spend less time with her family. She meets a good looking young soldier and convinces him to come home with her so she doesn't have to be a disappointment to her mother...depressing. On top of that...yes, there is more...we have Diane Keaton's sister, who has a strained relationship and shoplifts some jewelry for a present, only to get caught and have a thoughtful one on one conversation with a police officer...you guessed it....depressing. Did I forget to mention that the sister is played by Marissa Tomei? Yes, Marissa Tomei, so there lies a big problem for me. The casting of this film is all over the place. It seems they wanted to cast the recognizable face and name and not the role. In this film, we have constant 'flashes of memories' of the characters when they were younger. So we flash to the sisters when they were kids. They are maybe, 3 to 5 years apart. Then we come to the present and discover that the sister is Diane Keaton and Marissa Tomei. They have a 20 year age difference between each other. On top of that Alan Arkin plays their father....he is 12 years older than Keaton. I was so confused as to how Arkin and Tomei fit into the picture for 75% of the film. I thought he was Goodman's brother and Tomei was Keaton's daughter. While the cast does a decent job in the roles, none of the material is strong enough to hold any weight. None of the stories are engaging and it tries so hard to be emotional. I didn't really care about Goodman and Keaton's failing marriage because it never feels like the characters are really trying, or love each other, or anything at all really. The strained relationship between Keaton and almost everyone feels fake. None of these stories really work for me with the weakest one being Helms. He literally has nothing to do in this film, it's a little sad actually. Even for a 'depressing' Christmas film, Coopers fails. For it to be depressing, I feel like we need to have some sort of attachment to the characters, I had none. Steve Martin narrates the film to give it a ""Christmas story"" feel, it also falls a little flat. I just couldn't find myself caring about anything here.",Love the Coopers
29,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"A half dozen subplots, mostly going nowhere",6,21 December 2015,"Yet another variation of the ""extended family gets together for the holidays"", as JGoodman and his wife of 40 years bicker about a trip to Africa from decades earlier (if that is the worst thing about a 40 years marriage.....) There is a kind of amusing subplot of Olivia Wilde's character meeting a military man at the airport, but it is obviously going nowhere, and after a while, she becomes so stuck up and annoying, that we want the guy to save himself and leave.A handful of other vignettes concerning the various members of this extended family are thrown into the mix, Diane Keaton was miscast, and some puzzling use of CGI make this watchable, but not particularly memorable. Marisa Tomei gets arrested for shoplifting while on her way to Christmas dinner, and is driven around by the arresting officer for what appears to be several hours, while they cross examine each other, ad nauseum. A boring subplot, which is, again, obviously going nowhere. Amanda Seyfried has a few good scenes with Alan Arkin, but again, it predictably goes nowhere. At the end, the entire family displays the most random outburst of group dancing since Saving Christmas, while elderly Arkin is recovering from a stroke.Some of these things could be forgiven, if there was more fun involved, but the laughs are only mild throughout this unfocused, cluttered mess. A plot, and a subplot were needed, not a half dozen subplots all going nowhere. I realise this is really getting picky, but there should have been a comma in the title. As it reads now, it seems like it is telling us to love the Coopers.",Love the Coopers
30,RforFilm,Love The Coopers is like getting a nice looking Christmas card from a family that you'd never spend the holidays with,4,14 November 2015,"Do you notice that a lot of made for television Christmas movies have stage play-like quality to the writing? Many of those movies deal with family drama and to be fair, has potential to be just as juicy as many of the plays that they are trying to imitate. Of course for the average Joe, the corniness and stereotype characters are enough just to see some nice Christmas colors that rarely show up these days. Now for someone that constantly watches movies, I really wonder why these kind of projects use writers that clearly only want to collect a paycheck and never engage.My family isn't the kind that's ripe for a Christmas special as most are for the same reason; we are boring. The holidays are a wonderful time but it's rare to bring out a controversial subject, but no one wants to be the to kill the party. I'm sure there are families out there that have issue and if they are brought up during this period, then they are brave people to do so. I would think showing these brave individuals would have some heavy material that could bring something new to the Christmas family genre. Too bad nobody told that to those that made Love the Coopers.Here we have a large family that's getting ready for their Christmas Eve festivities as we first zoom in on our family patriarchs, Sam Cooper (played by John Goodman) and Charlotte Cooper (played by Diane Keaton) who are under the assumption that this will be the last as a full family with their adult children and families as the two are considering a divorce. The love they've had for years seems gone and spend plenty of time arguing over vacations and family. They haven't told anyone, so they put up a loving show for the sake of their children.The first of the Sam & Charlotte kids is Hank (played by Ed Helms) who is looking for work after being let go from his photography job. His kids are Charlie whose looking for his first kiss, Bo who wants his brother to be happy, and Madison who's just here to enjoy the holidays. The other adult child is Eleanor (played by Olivia Wilde) who is an aspiring writer who can't stand to be with her family. We also have a senile great aunt Fishy (played by June Squib), sister of Charlotte life coach Emma (played by Marisa Tomei), and father of Charlotte professor Bucky (played by Alan Arkin). Oh, and their dog is narrating (voiced by Steve Martin).As you can see, Love the Coopers has a very large cast of well-known actors. I would have loved to see this film take advantage of their power and work with it, but Love the Coopers is just a boring excuse for us to look at the Christmas decorations in the background. I'll start by saying that the marketing is false, as I thought this was going to be a comedy with some occasional drama but plenty of yuletide yucks. That is not the case as this movie is actually a drama with almost no laughs.None of the actors ever have anything clever to say, and I mean never. I think at the most, except for a dog-farting joke (that I laughed at), we're just watching a family that is way too clean and polished to seem like a real family with problems. The worst part of all is that the problems they do pick are either cliché or just too uncomfortable.I'll give this four dog eaten turkeys out of ten. Aside from a gorgeous looking picture, it feels too nice and cowardly to take any real chances. If you want a better Christmas movie about conflicting families, I'd say watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation or The Ref. Love the Coopers is like getting a nice Christmas card from a family you barley know; you look at the imagery and message before throwing it away to never remember them again.",Love the Coopers

When I think of all the talent involved with ""Love the Coopers"" and compare it to the film's potential and overall quality, I'm inspired to alter Churchill's quote to fit this movie: ""Never in the goal of human entertainment has so much talent given so many so little."" The film is an ensemble comedy-drama which follows several members of the Cooper family on Christmas Eve as they prepare to have dinner at mom and dad's house. Mom and dad are Charlotte and Sam Cooper (Diane Keaton and John Goodman), a couple whose 40+ year marriage is ending, but who have decided to put on a brave face so they can have one last ""perfect"" family Christmas. One of their children is Eleanor (Olivia Wilde), who still bears the emotional scars from the ending of her one great romance, but attempts to cover them up with sarcasm and self-pity. Sam and Charlotte's other child is Hank (Ed Helms), a man who has been unemployed for some time and has hidden that fact from his kids, horny teenager Charlie (Timothée Chalamet), caring and precocious Bo (Maxwell Simpkins), foul-mouthed Madison (Blake Baumgartner) and Charlie's estranged wife, Angie (Alex Borstein). Also planning on coming to the dinner are Charlotte's insecure younger sister, Emma (Marisa Tomei), Charlotte and Emma's lonely father, Bucky (Alan Arkin), and Sam's forgetful Aunt Fishy (June Squibb).Throughout the day leading up to Christmas Eve dinner, we see most of these characters sharing intimate details of their personal and family problems with total or near-total strangers. Sam and Charlotte argue over the correct lyrics while performing Christmas carols for a group of nursing home residents. In an airport bar, Eleanor strikes up a conversation with an Army Soldier named Joe (Jake Lacy) to whom she relates her deep-seated insecurities. Emma is caught trying to shoplift a Christmas gift for Charlotte and during the police car ride that followed, Emma tells the arresting officer, Percy Williams (Anthony Mackie) all about her tumultuous history with her sister, while getting him to open up about his very private personal secrets. Meanwhile, Bucky is doing what he does every day, eating at a diner he hates so he can chat with his favorite waitress, a lost soul named Ruby (Amanda Seyfried). And then there's Charlie who goes from being unable to talk with his teenage crush, Molly (Lauren Hesselberg), who's working in a local mall, to enthusiastically making out with her in about 5.3 seconds.The characters in ""Love the Coopers"" are written, presented and portrayed as unlikeable and unrealistic. Besides the inexplicable scenes of most of the Coopers spilling their guts to people they hardly know or just met, their various predicaments are just plain ridiculous. It seems that the main reason Sam and Charlotte and splitting up is an argument over an oft-postponed dream trip to Africa. The very odd way that Emma tries to shoplift (or that a middle-aged woman does that to begin with) is made even odder by the many ridiculous lies that she tells security and then Officer Williams, with all of it played like its supposed to be cute. Eleanor and Joe are polar opposites as people and rudely disrespect each other's differences, but she invites him to spend Christmas Eve with her family. (And don't even get me started on Joe drinking while in uniform, wearing his collar up throughout the movie and the rank on his chest changing positions between shots in the same scene!) Bucky has a grandfatherly, but still very odd attachment to Ruby, even getting angry when he discovers that she has withheld important details about her life from him. And when Lauren starts enthusiastically but badly French-kissing Charlie in public places, what is apparently supposed to be funny is really just disgusting and off-putting.The script and the movie in general are formulaic, but the filmmakers even got the formulas wrong. Much of the structure of this movie seems stolen from ""A Christmas Story"", complete with frequent narration, quirky characters and a scene of a little kid taking on a big bully. There are also moments that will remind many a Movie Fan of ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" and any number of other movies in which family members dread going to their family's holiday get-together but end up experiencing some personal and familial growth before the movie ends. Unfortunately, those elements that worked so well in some of those other movies simply don't work here – for the reasons that I've already discussed and because of a noticeable absence of genuine joy in almost every scene throughout the movie. Even the cast's frequent overacting doesn't help. As bad as the build-up was, I kept hoping that these stories would come together during the family's Christmas Eve gathering and produce resolution of conflicts and warm family moments. While the film makes attempts at some of that, the results feel as awkward as everything that led up to those scenes and aren't enjoyable to watch. ""Love the Coopers""? Not even close. ""D-""",Love the Coopers
33,jrarichards,Mixed-bag of Christmas fare including the sickly sweet plus some more appetising elements,6,1 January 2016,"At the outset we should assume that nobody is going to see this film for its thrills and spills, action, as a gore fest or for other reasons than that they want to feel good at Christmas. Hence we should be making a judgment of it on this basis, and not as another entry in the history of groundbreaking film-making. (In fact there is one groundbreaking element to the film, revealed at the end, to universal groans (audibly so in the cinema I was at) which suggest firmly that this particular ground might have been better left unbroken). Anyway, if we compare like with like, we will note that a number of American films (and indeed Polish and other countries' films) have sought to pull off another ""Love Actually"", and have (happily) failed to do so. Richard Curtis is a genius, and he imbued his Christmas masterpiece with a very specific and hard-to-achieve mix of emotions in which we do not quite stray into meaningless syrup, and do have both genuinely comedic and meaningful/serious elements. ""Love the Coopers"" (aka ""Christmas with the Coopers"") is also looking for this middle ground, and occasionally seems as if it might succeed. Here we do have a number of interlocking stories mixing comedy and real-life issues and pathos that gradually connect together as we come closer and closer to the Christmas table. But a snowy Pittsburgh can not supply the broad canvas offered by London, so there is a small-town feel in which Alan Arkin (and his patriarchal character) look a tad out of place, while the likes of Ed Helms and Amanda Seyfried look more at home. The effect is underlined by the fact that, while ""Love Actually"" resembles its host city of London in having a number of layers of interconnectedness that go far beyond ties of blood to a highly (at times incongruously) diverse wider community (a key feature of the movie, as it turns out), ""the Coopers"" are basically one family, and that confines the story - for good or ill - to one in which we see that such units in society have their ups and downs (mainly downs), but in the end blood is thicker than water. It's not a new message, but it retains some value and is portrayed convincingly enough here (and by a number of experienced high-profile actors, when all's said and done), hence the film's rescue from the status of out-and-out flop. There are some funny scenes, some warm scenes and some scenes that move into ""yuk"" territory (for various reasons). A joy of this film (indeed a plot for a film by itself) is a developing and quite authentic-looking (and hugely eye-catching) romance between ostensibly ill-matched characters played by Olivia Wllde and Jake Lacy. From the point of view of the cohesion of the film this is actually a mixed blessing, given that we the audience seem to find ourselves ""waving on"" certain scenes as quickly as possible in order to get back to this thread. The thread between the aforesaid Helms and Seyfried is definitely underplayed, while the apparently key characters portrayed by Diane Keaton and John Goodman are not enthralling enough (or perhaps just too familiar?) to justify the screen time they get. The Marisa Tomei-Anthony Mackie thread seems to get it about right, indeed so much so that we rather wish for a way of contriving to work our troubled Police Officer into the final scenes (which would obviously stretch credibility to breaking point). To sum up, if you can get cheaper tickets and are in an uncomplaining and kindly mood - and if you have seen ""love Actually"" as often as you need - then ""Love the Cooopers"" is an OK seasonal rom-com - but catch it now, while still fresh, since this is not likely to prove a memorable Christmas feel-gooder in years to come!",Love the Coopers
34,Carycomic,Fair warning: this is definitely _not_ a made-for-Hallmark Christmas movie.,8,15 November 2015,"In fact, it's more like a cross between THE FAMILY STONE (Diane Keaton's previous Xmas flick) and PARENTHOOD. Provided such a hybrid was produced/directed/written by Woody Allen!What do I mean by such a cryptic, and seemingly asinine, statement?Well, if you go in expecting a laugh riot from start to finish, you're going to be disappointed. The jokes I actually laughed at, as intended, are few and far between. And the serious moments can get so melodramatic, you might literally cringe and feel tempted to walk out on this flick (as I almost did). But, if you can mentally glue yourself to your seat through the latter, I guarantee you it will all be worthwhile.Why? Because, there are actually quite a few brilliant plot twists in here!For example, a lot of you might initially feel that Amanda Seyfried and Alan Arkin's characters are headed for a May/December romance similar to Liv Ullman and Edward Albert in 1973's 40 CARATS.Wrong!And, some might think that Marissa Tomei's character, a light-fingered ""life coach"" (which is apparently like a psychiatrist...minus the couch and drugs), will ultimately turn Officer Williams, the policeman who arrested her, into an African-American Ann Heche.Wrong! Some might even predict that the phantom narrator, as voiced by Steve Martin, will turn out to be merely _posing_ as one of the dozens of department store Santa Clauses seen headed to work at various times throughout this film. Wrong!That particular plot twist is probably the funniest one of all. And, the Xmas sing-along ""blooper"" reel, during the ending credits, is masterfully poignant. So, to paraphrase what Angie tells Sergeant Joe as soon as they arrive to meet her parents (as played, almost too convincingly, by Ms. Keaton and John Goodman): ""Man up, and sit all the way through this flick! It'll be worth it.""",Love the Coopers

I didn't like it and will probably struggle to watch another Christmas movie this festive season.Such a talented cast completely gone to waste. I didn't really know what was happening with this. It managed to succeed in feeling like a lot was happening, without anything happen - all at the same time.It was oddly dark and depressive in a tiresome kind of way. Things were resolved randomly for no apparent reason. It didn't actually feel all that festive somehow either. There was too much arguing, not enough decent script and a whole lot of cringe.I had low expectations with it being a Christmas movie, but it still somehow disappointed me. I don't think anything actually happened. What plot? There was none.

Oh, when he ate inside the MASHED POTATOES. Then at dinner time if you noticed most of the FAMILY KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE MASHED POATOES.
But nobody said anything they just kept eating them. There was some much wrong with this FAMILY it kind of reminded me of my MESSED UP FAMILY.
Oh and that other part when she went and got her MOM SOMETHING EXPENSIVE FROM THE HOSPITAL STORE.

If you google this film you come up with Love The Coopers, obviously on the American side of the pond it goes under this name. From the title you can immediately gauge what this film is about. A family, made up of many dysfunctional parts which comes together at Christmas, each hiding their own secrets and fighting their own demons. At the centre of this family we find John Goodman and Diane Keaton, two well established stars who keep this story flowing along as the main protagonists of this fairly mundane plot. However, although it was not a laugh a minute, it was a completely watchable film. Token man in uniform played by Jake Lacy who had one of those faces I feel I've seen before but can't actually place......quite nice to look at though. Narrated by Steve Martin the film comes to a touching and plausible end. A nice easy watch on the run up to Christmas.",Love the Coopers

For example, this is probably the best role for Olivia Wilde after 13 of House fame. Finally someone got it that she's not a great actress since she ain't got a great range, but, if well cast, can do a fine job. Don't try to make her very sexy. She's hot because she's interesting (looks and brains, both), not because she's very sexy.Also, depicting an extended family and various ways people interact in those is good. Not great or very insightful, mind you, but, still, good.The dog telling the story and having a ""stress eating"" episode seeing how crazy his human hosts behave also works nice.But, that's about it.

There are many scathing reviews about the plot and the characters and the clichés. Evidently what we needed yesterday were clichés - because we enjoyed it.Yes it was predictable - yes it was cliché ridden, but we have to remember this is a Christmas movie - and in our age of cynicism, foreign threats, daily shootings in the ""hood,"" and politically charged nastiness, sometimes we just need a little break and watch something which is warm- hearted and positive. If you want nasty ""realism"" try ""August: Osage County"" or ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" - both of those show people at their absolute worst.

I expected a dumb family comedy based on my pre-judgement of seeing the IMDb ratings. Not only did I find this movie tremendous, but I found myself as madly in love with it as some of the characters do with each other. It's a movie for all ages, for cinephiles, for filmmakers who'd like to see cinematography and editing beyond most commercialized Christmas movies, and for Timothée Chalamet fans who want to see his dance moves pre-Call Me by Your Name. This film unearthed inner desires I didn't know I had and gave me a sense of hope I need right now. My only cruxes with this film are in its inescapable cheesiness, chaotic story structure of intertwining stories, and its ""twist"" ending that could've been avoided. Take away the commercialized Christmas glaze, leave the technical choices, leave the cast and their genuine performances, and cut out some of the ""happy ending"", prewritten/everything-lines-up-perfectly resolutions. Then, this film will be less of a critical/audience generic flop and more of a wholesome family drama. I intend on doing a full review of this film towards the holidays.

47,KATO-SUBZERO,"Chevy Chase's Christmas Vacation, this movie Ain't",4,1 February 2016,"31 January 2016 I like actress Diane Keaton. She is good in all of her movies, but this movie {Not her fault} is one of her worse movies. Marisa Tomei is always good and she is always sexy too without trying to be. I had wanted to see this movie in the theaters when it came out, but it was yanked from the theaters in full two weeks. That is a big hint in itself. I just saw it on the I-net. Thank goodness, I did Not waste my money. It not even worth the matinée price which can be high if a patron lives in a big major city.The cast is good, but the movie itself lacks a lot. It seems to be trying to be funny like the classic Chevy Chase, Beverly DeAngelo ""Christmas Vacation"" movie and trust me, it is a long ways from that holiday classic film, which I watch every Christmas.Farting at the dinner table and everyone thinks it's the dog when it appears to be grandma, not that funny. The little girl using profanity is Not funny at all and anytime small kids are cursing is always a bad example for anyone to see in a movie. The little boy throwing food at the dinner table, that is not funny. For a comedy, this had only a few funny scenes. I am an Army veteran and I saw one big goof up is actor Jake Lacy playing the role of Army private Bailey in wears his one strip rank upside down in most scenes then it finally gets corrected while at the dinner table. This should have been corrected prior to filming his scenes. The director or wardrobe person must have either been in the Air Force or thought the character was in the Air Force because they are the only branch of the U.S military that wears their enlisted rank opposite of Army.",Love the Coopers
48,Paul-271,A Complete Failure,3,1 July 2021,"There wasn't a laugh or even a smile in this jerky, disconnected try. It's an astonishing waste of several top personalities such as Goodman, Arkin and Tomei. I find it astonishing that these three, all my faves, managed to fail completely in this misbegotten outing.A good deal of the problem here is the usual Hollywood detachment from reality. For example, Helms plays a divorced man paying child support for two uninteresting and one offensive (supposedly funny) children. His career consists of various low wage retail style jobs that he can't secure now that he's been replaced in his previous job by a robot. Despite him making maybe $9/hr. And paying all that child support he lives in a large home in suburbia. I suppose that's Hollywood's idea of how the poor masses exist.Strange looking Oliva Wilde plays the type of woman who you'd meet on a blind date, are first attracted to her looks but as soon as she speaks, you arrange for a rescue call to get you out of there. She's so repulsive that the romance she's supposedly part of doesn't work at all.Then we have the crippled, demented old lady who grows lucid for most of the movie spouting gobbets of wisdom throughout. Without going into detail, the upshot is not one likeable character or setup.

50,keithlovesmovies,Love the Coopers Review,5,22 November 2015,"When four generations of the Cooper clan (Alan Arkin, Diane Keaton, John Goodman, June Squibb, Ed Helms, Marisa Tomei, and Olivia Wilde) come together for their annual Christmas Eve celebration, a series of unexpected visitors (Alex Borstein, Amanda Seyfried, and Jake Lacy) and unlikely events turn the night upside down, leading them all toward a surprising rediscovery of family bonds and the spirit of the holiday.Now stop me if you've never heard of and/or seen any of this before. So it's almost winter so that means it's almost Christmas. With that means Christmas films and this one is the first of this season (seems like they're coming out earlier every year). This film is about a dysfunctional family (as most Christmas films are) trying to get together for Christmas (as most do) and things don't quite go according to plan (as most go). What's different about this one is that Charlotte and Sam Cooper's (Keaton and Goodman) son Hank (Ed Helms) has a dysfunctional family of his own (Borstein, Timothée Chalamet, Maxwell Simkins, and Blake Baumgartner). Of course Charlotte and Sam are having marital problems and Hank and his wife Angie (Borstein) are divorced so there is a slight parallel here. So the main plot of the film consists of Charlotte and Sam getting ready for their Christmas Eve celebration while also following each Cooper family member as they make their way to the celebration. I will admit that it was kind of interesting following each of them around as we got to learn about each character. I will admit that some family members were more interesting than others but that opinion could have changed if they were followed a little more equally. The film chose to follow mostly Charlotte and Sam and their daughter Eleanor (Wilde). I found that I did not care as much about Sam and Charlotte's story as I did about Eleanor (and that's not saying much). It was really sad that considering the cast the had for this one that they wasted the remaining family members. I barely got to hear about Helm's Hank and Charlotte's sister Emma's (Marisa Tomei) (which is weird since she is 19 years younger in real life and their characters are supposed to be 3 years apart) arc was not interesting at all since we never got to learn anything about her character. I also need to mention Anthony Mackie in a minor role where he did not get to do to much either. The only thing I found really funny was a running gag throughout the film about the fact that Nick's teenage son Charlie (Chalamet) not knowing how to properly kiss. Like I said, it was funny despite being overdone. And despite even all of that, none of this stuff matters as much when the plot is full of holes yet predictable and drowning in cheese and cliché. I will however say that the acting wasn't necessarily bad per se but I just don't think the writing was very good. Overall, if you like the cast than this one might be worth a look but otherwise it's just another predictable Christmas film.Score: 5.5/10",Love the Coopers

Usually, I write the reviews immediately after I watch a movie but in this case some days have past so I am therefore unable to comment in detail and the things that I especially did not like. But, I know that I expected a great Christmas movie and was let down. The energies of characters do not fit with one another.

And this is the typical Christmas holiday movie, but it is entertaining and funny.It tells the story of various members from the Cooper family and how they get to arrive to the Christmas Dinner. As in this kind of movies, there are a lot of characters and you might connect better with ones than others. For example, I think Amanda Seyfried here was misused, and she could have give more, as well as others like the little kids needed less time on-screen (that's also usual in this movies). The characters I liked the most are Eleanor portrayed by a beautiful Olivia Wilde and Sam portrayed by John Goodman. It's not that the acting is superb but for me they were some of the best of the movie.Of course it's not a perfect movie. Since the beginning you probably will guess how it will end. It's full of clichés of romantic-holiday movies but it's still very enjoyable.

53,CutUncut2021,Cranberries get on my nerves,8,14 May 2021,"As usual, read the worst reviews first in order to take the pulse of the vacuous IMDb voter universe: this is a witty and often touching tale that seems to elude its audience. Even the professional reviewers dissed the movie. With such a promising cast and the brilliant DoP Elliot Davis (add the Christmas season, no less): what could go wrong? Well, we're in America so just about everything, because it's the American public paying, and if they reckon they didn't get their pound of flesh (add gas, parking, popcorn, ice-cream), we have an elected turkey (indeed, the following year's election said it all). Anyone who is suspicious about religion but believes in Nina Simone's voice and confesses that ""it's the closest I'll ever get to believing in God"" is the kind of person to spend the day with. The running joke is that life is all a performance: we're a bunch of munchkins with plastic smiles performing to spouses and children, bosses and neighbours, spouting trite daily formulas and formalities rule our lives. Not content with Easter and ""White"" Christmas, the Americans invented Thanksgiving, then Halloween -- anything to facilitate the act of buying and selling consumer souls -- and whoops, ""Black"" Friday! Worst of all, they managed to export this commercial capitalist pap even to the so-called developing world (in Europe the confectioners now bake yucky witch biscuits and pumpkin madeleines, replete with orange icing) . On the positive side, Mackie's ""I'm not a robot"" offers a fitting motto for all the smiling plastic performances one must face each day: the awkward chemistry between the arresting police officer Percy Williams (Mackie) and the arrested Emma (Tomei) merits developing into a screenplay on its own. Then we have FOMO (fear of missing out), ""We dissected rats together, then we married"". . . . ""Cranberries get on my nerves."" . . . The jokes pile up, one-liners spill out apace, just as in the good ol' days when writers knew their stuff, thanks to Steven Rogers. And the actors, oh how the actors relish having such lines. Squibb is now in her nineties, instead of slotting her in cameo roles, she has the balls for a screenplay just for her. The film's saccharine closure is admittedly corny Hallmark fug, but after nearly two hours of oddball humour, all is forgiven. For the disappointed viewers, I recommend first an enema, then the drama-documentary ""Fire at Sea"" (2016, Gianfranco Rosi) about people drowning in the Mediterranean in their attempt to reach ""civilisation"".

An adult movie that doesn't rely of car chases, sex and gun fire to entertain. I laughed WITH this family and AT this family. What a hoot. Watch it for pure fun.",Love the Coopers
57,NeelyO,Deserves a slot in the Christmas canon,8,25 October 2016,"Any number of the films we now think of as unassailable holiday classics -- Christmas in Connecticut, White Christmas, even It's a Wonderful Life -- were dismissed as corny and formulaic in their original reviews, so it's no surprise that Meet the Coopers met the same fate. But I suspect time will be kind to this one: it's warm without being gooey, the humor is sharp and observant, the ensemble is top-notch, and the soundtrack is quite lovely.If, like me, you're a fan of the dysfunctional-family Christmas comedy (The Ref, La Bûche, A Christmas Tale), this one may well sneak up on you and enter your annual holiday rotation. If I ever get to update my holiday film guide ""Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas,"" this one would definitely go in.",Love the Coopers

59,YellowManReanimated,Marisa Tomei as Diane Keaton's sister??? (Plus a review),6,22 December 2015,"I actually didn't mind this movie. I watched it with my girlfriend as neither as of us were motivated enough to jump on the Star Wars bandwagon but fancied watching a movie anyway. We didn't go in with high expectations and so weren't disappointed but... I cannot accept this aspect of the movie. It's completely ridiculous! Marisa Tomei must be, what, at least 20 years younger than Diane Keaton, on top of that she looks about 30 years younger than her. Tomei is amazing looking and would've been a much more believable choice as Olivia Wilde's older sister in my view. Casting like this just takes you out of the story and makes it that much more difficult to invest in the dynamics of the characters. Why not just cast an older actress? Other issues: Not enough exposition in relation to the dead sister. Too much reading between the lines on that one. Clearly it's going to be a major part of what's haunting the family but it feels brushed under the carpet. I'm starting to feel really sorry for Alan Arkin now too. His role in these indie films seems to be to have some sort of heart- attack or stroke. It's almost as if seeing his name in the titles gives you one the major plot points of the film. Couldn't the creators have been a little more imaginative? I also thought there was an issue with him being Diane Keaton's dad, what is he supposed to be, like 90? Keaton looks great, make no mistake, but she also looks her age, as does John Goodman by the way. It's unlikely that either of their parents would be too far away from a nursing home, unless they were freaks of nature (Goodman's aunt at least is more believable in this respect). I did like the acting in the film though and the dynamics between the characters. Tomei's journey in the cop car was impossibly long, was she being deported to a different state? But I enjoyed her interaction with the policeman. Keaton and Goodman are a joy to watch, at any age, as is Alan Arkin, and Wilde and her army man sure did have chemistry. I felt having the doctor be her lover towards the end was a little contrived, however, did we really did that extra twist in the ""will they won't they"" saga? So a movie which had a nice, albeit far from original message, which was well acted, yet with casting issues, which was also a little contrived and ultimately took the road of sentiment over pursuing any profound insight into human beings. Perhaps worth watching for some of the very organic and natural-feeling interactions which do occur within the film, but not to be entered with high expectations.",Love the Coopers
60,slydon13,The New 'Love Actually',8,12 December 2015,"Its a story of a family on Christmas Eve. Diane Keaton and John Goodman are married with an adult son (Ed Helms) and daughter (Olivia Wilde). Alan Arkin is Diane Keaton and Marisa Tomi's father (thought the ages are clearly off there). June Squibb is Goodman's aunt.Like most families who have moved on with their lives, they dislike spending time together. Dealing with expectations, facing their own inadequacies, long buried resentments and everything else that come with human relationships, they are individually dreading the time together.The jokes are subtle with no slapstick crassness. They are contextual and many perhaps you need life experience to appreciate.The music is great, there are many dogs and the set design gives an idealized Americana that town could hope to match. In fairness, many women see a cute soldier alone in an airport and let their minds wander. Nothing hotter than a man in uniform!My 10 yo nephew chose the film (I wanted to see Snoopy) but in the end he had to keep telling his mother and I to keep our laughter down (and we hadn't even been drinking). Apparently the trailer lead people to believe it would be funnier but I loved it.Its happier than 'The Family Stone', less romantic than 'Love Actually' and with more dogs than 'Macbeth'.",Love the Coopers

The thing about the classics is that they were/are authentic in a way that can't be reproduced, and the problem with movies like this - the ""pretenders"" - is that they are riding the coattails of a gimmick of some sort, in this case a vast cast of characters played by well known and beloved actors. This is a movie that was created with everyone thinking this is going to be a hit like Love Actually, and they try to hit all the right notes, only to come out sounding sour. And please, can we just put to rest some of the more annoying cliches found in this movie: the addled senior who speaks more truth than anyone else (there is nothing cute or wise about dementia sufferers), the foul-mouthed child who is neither adorable nor funny, the love-struck -angsty teen, the out-of-control dog who destroys everything in its path, and the idea that there are troops of Victorian-clad Christmas carolers around every corner at Christmas time.

I think they did a decent job with this movie, it did keep my attention and there were a couple funny moments, along with a few sweet ones. I think they did a good job on the location and feeling of this movie. Plus they showed lots of pooches, which is always a plus in my book.Meh:
One thing I just could not get over was Olivia Wilde's horrible character, I am sorry, were we supposed to like her or even care? The woman was awful. There is no way a guy, let alone a stranger, would put up with her borderline-hate filled comments. Putting down his religion, his service and father. Also, it is hard to care about someone who admits to sleeping with a married man and seems to have no qualms about it. Then the back and forth of the guy ""leaving"" only to come right back within minutes, after more of her verbal combative and rude comments. I hate it when they make characters so cynical and emotionally cut off for whatever fill in the blank moment, but this ONE stranger can thaw their icy heart in a matter of days/weeks...in this case HOURS. Then at the end when she dashes to find him? SHE STRAIGHT UP KNOCKS OVER SOMEONE IN A HOSPITAL GURNEY?!?!?! Runs smack dab into about 7 people, one carrying a beautiful flower bouquet, what if these people were going to see their dying loved ones?? Hated this character and woman, awful, awful, awful.Few other things I thought were pretty dumb:
Teenagers literally slapping tongues together - stupid.The relationship between the old guy and waitress - what?Marissa Tomei's character ""calling"" everything about a total stranger and hitting it all on the head.Marissa Tomei's character being Diane Keaton's sister??? They are like 25 years about, she could be her daughter, but in the flashbacks they are like 4-7 years apart? Yeah, right.Diane Keaton and John Goodman's characters that allllllll the sudden in the last 3 minutes decide they are madly in love again because she finally agrees to go to Africa, even though the whole movie is them and their broken relationship. Should have put more effort into that resolution.The end scene of everyone dancing in the fanciest hospital I have ever seen in my life. CORN BALL STEW.",Love the Coopers

Not a single storyline was interesting--instead they were sad and pathetic. I found myself marveling that the movie took place during one single day because it felt like it drug on and on. I just couldn't wait for it to be over because another reviewer said that the last 15 minutes made it worthwhile. I'm going to agree to disagree. Words kept popping into my head like ""ugh"" and ""ick."" I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. And what was up with Eleanor, the least likeable in this cast of unlikeable characters, ending up with the honorable, decent guy?? She literally leaves destruction in her path, but it's apparently okay because she did it for a guy? What about the other people's Christmases that she ruined in her eleventh hour ""redemption?""

67,dcj2,SPOILER: Brought to you by Dyson??,2,4 March 2016,"Surely the engineers at Dyson who came up with the cyclonic action vacuum had a hand in this movie, because it sucked hard at the very beginning and never lost suction all the way through. (Well, that made my wife laugh, anyway). This was totally off my radar when it came out, so when the wife brought it home from Redbox I had no idea about the plot - not even that it was a ""Christmas movie"". Watching the opening credits and seeing all the good-to-very-good talent involved, I was sure I was in for a great little gem of a movie. 5 minutes in, I was totally disavowed of that notion. First: it's narrated. In the right hands, with the right story, narration in a film can work. But here, the narration serves to tell me who the characters are, what they're feeling, what their motivations are, etc. The first rule of great visual story telling (film, TV, stage) is ""Show, don't tell"". But this film relies heavily on the narration, and a pretty poorly written narration at that. If you were reading the same text in a novel you'd be rolling your eyes. And at that critical 5 minute mark, when only the most disconnected viewer doesn't realize the narrator is the dog - well that's when I wrote it off. For my wife's sake I suffered through the rest of it. Yes, there were a handful of very isolated moments that worked, but for the most part it was a disjointed, trope-filled, snoozer filled with stereotypical characters doing seemingly random things for no discernible reason, in spite of the previously mentioned narration. As the end approached, I sat in dread of the closing shot where they come back to the dog, snuggled beneath the Christmas tree, and with an animated human mouth wishes the viewer a ""Merry Christmas, and God bless us, every one!"" Thankfully the dog's voice was all internal and we're spared that indignity. Had we'd see the dog actually talk I may have been driven to put a stake of holly through my heart and boil myself in my own pudding. ;)",Love the Coopers
68,reneemsm,You'll either love it or hate it,7,15 November 2015,"I think this is one of those movies that you either love or hate. I loved it, my husband hated it. It definitely is a bit of a downer which is why I gave it a 7/10. It's not gonna be a movie that puts you in a holly jolly mood (at least not until the last 15 minutes). So I understand why many people disliked it. But with that said, I found the brutal honesty very charming. It felt real and still managed to have quite a few laughs in the midst of the drama. Very reminiscent of The Family Stone. I think if they hadn't marketed it as a comedy, so that people knew what to expect going in, it would have a better score right now. Something else that I noticed and loved was the way it was filmed. It was very beautifully shot, and there were lots of gorgeous close ups that, to me, made the scenes even better. And I really enjoyed how a few shots were filmed from the perspective of the children as they were running through crowds or stores etc. Very unique and added a little extra something (though maybe I only noticed because I'm a photographer). Probably not something kids will enjoy (there were more than a few in our theater and they didn't seem very interested).",Love the Coopers

72,istvandragos,You can almost love all of the Coopers,6,29 December 2015,"Love the Coopers continues the yearly tradition of star filled Christmas themed movies, but succeeds a bit more than the previous attempts, but not with very much, because sometimes it tries to tell way too much for a movie whose length barely exceeds 100 minutes.Love the Coopers presents the eponymous family's through the eye of 4 generations, each of them having a life crisis just before Christmas. Some of these crisis are really fun to watch, because most of them are presented in such a fashion that you either laugh or you either cry, but there is a third option too, where you simply just get bored and wait for the plot to get back to the more interesting arcs. One of the most interesting character of the movie is Marisa Tomei's, who's playing a single women, who lives in her families shadow, being always the black sheep of the family. Her interaction with the others around her are very well executed, as I mentioned before you either laugh or feel sorry for the characters. Another interesting arc is Olivia Wilde's who is playing the daughter of Diane Keaton's character, she's also considered the black sheep of the family, but she's a modern one, her character is closer to the contemporary teenagers, thus many of the young viewers will be able to connect with her. The old cast too has pretty well rounded conflicts and despite being old they have the right energy for this movie and it was clear that they enjoyed doing it( some old dudes should take notes).Despite all these very well developed conflicts there are some that are less interesting, like for instance Ed Helms's character which has very little to do during his short screen time. Also the solution to his arc is pretty obvious if you follow the details, you can figure it out already in the first 30 minutes of the movie. Another problem of the movie is that the screen is very crowded and you are starting to wonder what are some character doing there, well by the end of the movie everyone will meet, but not as many would like to and some pay offs are very unsatisfying. Also, Ed Helms's fictional teenager son has some awkward moments through the movie, but most likely these scenes were added for the sake of the young viewers. In conclusion the movie was very fun to watch, but sometimes it was hard to follow due to the high number of characters, but it was really enjoyable in some places, despite being very boring in other places. If the pay offs of the character arcs won't satisfy you, there is a little surprise in the end of the movie that will put a little smile on your face when you are leaving the theatre.",Love the Coopers

74,flamingblok11,The Fruitcake of Holiday Movies,2,14 November 2015,"Love the Coopers? I didn't. Neither will you.The first holiday film of the year arrives with a monumental thud, despite an impressively decorated, and star-studded cast. The dramedy revolves around the matriarch of the Cooper clan (Diane Keaton), who tires to bring her misshapen family together for a final Christmas dinner, before her and her husband of forty years (John Goodman) divorce. Like Love Actually, we jump from storyline to storyline, as we chart the progress of each family member's trek homeward.Unfortunately, comparing Love the Coopers to any film with the words ""love,"" or ""actually"" in the title would be an insult to those movies (Love the Coopers being the exception that establishes the rule). Actual jokes with a real set-up and punchline are few and far between, and rarely land anyway. Coopers largely relies on out of place vulgarity in place of comedy, or utilizes site gags that it recycles until there is a permanent dent in the ground where the dead horse used to be.As far as the movie's attempt at subversive drama, most of the characters are too poorly developed, or unrealistically written to be genuinely compelling. The script occasionally comes close to insight into some of these characters, but sheepishly walks away from the doorbell, instead of knocking down that door. The direction ranges from uninspired to downright disruptive of the film's flow, and the insistence on narrating every plot point and character trait before we actually get to see it, makes watching the film a formality.There are, maybe, one or two laughs to be had, and perhaps two subplots are somewhat compelling. Bucky (Alan Arkin) and Ruby (Amanda Seyfried) share a couple of scenes in a diner that are at least watchable, and Arkin turns in fairly solid performance. The most fleshed out story belongs to the romance between Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) and Joe (Jake Lacy). There's a real chemistry between the two of them, and there seems to be genuine depth to their characters.There might be a good movie based on their few scenes, if Eleanor weren't such an insufferable jerk.The real problem with Coopers is that it doesn't seem to have any fun, or good intention. I wouldn't mind the movie if it were just formulaic, and I can tolerate a bad movie. The reason that the film gave me a headache is because it seems to exist solely to grab the money out of your wallet. The film industry is undoubtedly a business, but at least disguise yourself; have some respect for your audience. By the film's end, you know it was sponsored by Southwest Airlines and McDonalds, and you know it went out of it's way to shamelessly appeal to every demographic (Anthony Mackie plays the generic black/gay guy). It's borderline offensive.Please, for the sake of your health, and for the future of the cinema, stay away from Love the Coopers.",Love the Coopers

It truly is a very realistic portrayal of so many families today (dysfunction or not)...especially around the holidays. As a mother of four grown children, I can certainly relate to Diane Keaton's (the matriarch of the Cooper clan) character. When she was talking about how huge her love for her children was that it completely consumed her, I could definately see myself saying those very words. There was so many messages and ""words of wisdom"" in this movie that really makes you think and reevaluate your own life.
I may also be a little biased in my love of this movie because it was filmed in my hometown of Pittsburgh, so seeing my beautiful city, especially during the holidays, was an added bonus.

Love the Coopers, in fact, is a pathetic rip-off, with an inferior narration, not to mention artificial situations and characters. Jake Lacy's work is indeed the best thing in it. The Olivia Wilde character is painful to watch and to listen to. You just wish the hell she'd shut the (you know what)up! I felt sorry for Keaton, Goodman and Arkin who are experienced enough to know they are trapped in a turkey, forcing the words put into their mouths with desperation and embarrassment.

80,blakerogers2015,"I wanted to enjoy this movie, but it was terrible",2,13 November 2015,"I want to start off by saying that I am fairly easy to please when it comes to movies. The last movie I saw was Burnt, which received generally negative reviews, but I loved it. There are several other movies recently that have received poor reviews that I enjoyed, so it is easy for me to enjoy movies. But wow, this movie was terrible. I truly do not believe how such an ensemble of wonderful actors and actresses could agree to star in this. A few nit picky things- This movie was beyond cliché. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy cliché movies. I actually like some movies that have generic parts. But the formula for this movie made me sick. It was so cheesy and so cliché that I really, truly at one point began to think this was a parody or satire created film that makes fun of generic and cliché movies, but it wasn't! There was no parody aspect to it. It was just terrible.Now let's talk about the characters. I want to start with Olivia Wilde's character Eleanor. Basically, when she enters the narrator says she has been hurt by love and closes herself off to love. Which means we all know where this is going. Which, again, I like cliché, but this was over the top. What happens is she meets an army man played very well by Jake Lacy. Their ""love story"" was so unbelievable because she, as the narrator says, was so hurt by love, yet when she meets Joe (played by Jake Lacy) she for some reason pursues him and instantly trust him. It was like as soon as the narrator said ""She could never love again,"" she instantly falls in love. And what's more, she was a terrible character. She was completely disrespectful to Joe and for some reason he was into her. She would insult his political views and character and act high and mighty when she was the one sleeping with a married man and the one hating her family. Next was Amanda Seyfried and Alan Arkin's story. It was totally weird. It felt like she was into a man 60 years older than her and it was weird. He gets angry instantly at her as she says she is moving because of ""great waitress opportunity."" I just didn't get it. She was totally thrown in there for no reason. Oh, wait. There was a reason. Literally the only reason she was in this move was to be the eye candy for ed Helm's character Hank. That is it. And of course Hank is divorced because no family in stupid movie like this can stay together apparently. The only saving grace in this movie... the reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1, was John Goodman and Diane Keaton's character Sam and Charlotte. They were on the verge of divorce after 40 years of marriage and i felt their relationship real. They were the only two people in the movie I hoped things would work out. And things do work out for the two, it was a completely stupid, cheesy, and cliché way it worked out, but I am glad it worked out nevertheless. I literally could not care for any character in this movie. It was hard to look past the terrible plot to even see such great actors dive into such terrible plots and scripts And my last, most annoying thing to say about this movie, is it is completely narrated through the dog. Yup, you heard me right. It was narrated by the dog of the family. Such a lazy and terrible way to make the plot continue. I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I love many of the actors and actresses in it. But They could not save this movie from such a terrible plot and passing and such terrible dialogue. Save your money.",Love the Coopers

And Diane Keaton is basically just revisiting a performance that she already gave in The Family Stone ten years ago. There are some amusing moments throughout, but then again, some of the story lines area just unnecessary. And joking about elders with senility? These gags are both tired and insensitive.

Nothing against the actress but she looked like she could be her daughter! I think there's 20 years between the actresses yet the flashbacks from their childhoods suggest an age gap of about 5 years!! It didn't work.Only two enjoyable parts; Aunt Fishy letting the dog take the blame for her fart and the cute revelation at the end that the 'dog' had been the narrator/Steve Martin.That's all I've got.

91,PaddyZoom,Not what you'd expect.,5,19 January 2016,"I stumbled upon this movie over the Christmas period during a family outing. We'd planed on seeing another movie but it was sold out, so we opted to give this film a try. On the surface the film appears to be a generic Christmas comedy, you'd expect a feel good family film with plenty of slapstick and silly moments, however it's much different.It's the well known and experienced cast that gets you intrigued, and the promotional material for the film makes it appear like a family film. I'd say the film is aimed more towards an adult audience. It starts very slow and the colours are very bland and dark, not at all like a fun filled Christmas film. It isn't long before you realise it's more of a dark comedy. We check in with all the different members of the Cooper family and soon realise they are all having a bad run up to Christmas. Almost a more realistic telling of what many might be experiencing at that time of the year.The film doesn't really get interesting until the Coopers get together for Christmas, the mood gets a lot more heartwarming and the jokes hit a lot better. The acting is good throughout but some of the dialogue is questionable. There are some thought provoking moments too which led me to feel satisfied by the end. Not at all for younger viewers, the film relates only to the older viewer who understands the dynamics of family life at Christmas.Overall the film is just average, with a couple of funny moments and an interesting insight into family's getting back together for Christmas. Don't expect to see a Christmas classic, but still worth a watch.",Love the Coopers

The trailer makes it look like a happy, lighthearted holiday movie...nothing could be further from the truth. Everyone is miserable and unhappy with themselves and each other. None of the characters are likable, the relationships are not at all believable, the dialog is terrible, the storyline awful awful AWFUL...it is literally the worse movie I've ever seen, and I've watched Sharknado. Like others have said, it's completely clichéd. And it was narrated! The writers also kept throwing as much politically correct stuff they could think of into the mix....negative jabs at Fox News, republicans, God (as in, not only does He not exist, but what blasphemous things can we come up with to say about Him?), gun control, religion, etc. Wait, there was one good thing...there was a super cute dog who would make periodic appearances.

I was first sucked in by the great John Goodman and the sublime Alan Arkin. Once Olivia Wilde's character started to develop I was hooked.I am gobsmacked to see how wrong the low ratings for this movie are. The unique characters and the depth of emotions, mostly love, are incredible. Maybe people want quick cuts and action and just don't know how to let a movie based on dialogue slowly draw them in and make you care about the characters, all of which are rounded and easily lovable,yet each deeply flawed in ways anyone that has lived a few decades will identify with. I am a tough guy in my 50s and I shed tears three times. Not only that,but several times I had to pause the film so I could ponder how the wise words about love and life relate to my life and mistakes. From this day on my life will be better because of what i realized was true,as displayed in this movie, about family, love, regrets. And I will forever love Olivia Wilde. Her scenes alone are worth watching this movie. If you can watch this movie closely and not shed a tear, you are dead inside and should immediately seek psychiatric help.

Although every review I've seen of this has been very harsh - I can't help but disagree, I thought it did the job of what it as meant to do , and how can you hold a grudge over that?

Now, I'm not gonna go as far as another reviewer and say it was the worst movie I've ever seen because it was not even close to being that bad. But there were loads of plot holes. The elderly lady is in a wheelchair in a care home but at the end of the movie she is dancing like she's never had a sick day in her life. Marisa Tomei and Diane Keeton are supposed to be sisters that are about 3 years apart... WTH?! They are 19 years difference in real life so even stretching the imagination isn't gonna work too well on that one. The people I was with kept thinking Marisa was Diane's daughter so we were having a hard time understanding the whole thing. Most of the movie is separate stories that finally come together. We have a young woman who is in love with an elderly man? Or is she falling in love with his son? Who knows, it was very odd. And the elderly man has a stroke that lands him in the hospital and low and behold he wakes up, just walks out of his room down to the cafeteria and stands there for a while watching him family. Sure, that's realistic. The story was all over the place and many things just didn't make any sense. Don't even get me started on what a horrific person Olivia Wilde's character was. On that path, Diane Keeton's character was kinda a b*tch as well. The whole pile of issues she had with her husband and they just disappear at the end and we are supposed to believe that they've been arguing non-stop for years and poof, a couple kisses and all is good? Horsecrap. Such a disappointment because we had a stellar cast on this and I'm sure they aren't too happy with how this turned out.",Love the Coopers

Stories are real and very to the point on where Christmas can often be a time of loneliness. Give this film a go. I will be seeing it again.

109,woodruffw,There's No One Left to Love,1,20 July 2016,"The ""Holiday Family Dramedy"" is sort of a genre unto itself. One could write a similar story, with similar jokes and disappointments set at any other time of year, but somehow setting the tale at Christmas makes it more meaningful. Whether it's nostalgia or hopefulness, something about the holidays adds an extra point of connection between us and the characters.Unfortunately, ""Love the Coopers"" features a bunch of characters with whom it's very difficult to connect. But for a couple of exceptions, they are all totally unlikable. Forget attempting to relate to them, if you met any of these people in real life you'd go out of your way to avoid being in the same room with them ever again. Given the wonderful cast, it's a real feat of failure that the writer and director turned them into such jerks.I suppose the creators were aiming for a revamped ""Love Actually"". But, rather than having a troupe of mostly unconnected characters falling in and out of love, what we have here is a bunch of dysfunctional family members all dealing with screwed up relationships. The parents are planning to separate after 40 years of marriage; the newly- unemployed son is struggling to provide for his family while dealing with his shrew of an ex-wife; the free- spirited daughter has had her heart-broken and falls in love in the airport but is too hurt to genuinely connect; the widowed grandfather has developed a kind of creepy paternal bond with a waitress who announces she's leaving town; the black sheep sister is a spinster who likes to shoplift and develops her most powerful connection with the cop who arrests her.No one gets a meaningful backstory. Instead, the writer opts for an expository shortcut by including a rather intrusive narrator, who turns out to be the family dog with Steve Martin's voice. The narration tells us what the characters are feeling and why. The audience is left to take him at his word, since we don't actually get to see any of the moments that brought the characters to this point. As a result of this narrative failure, it's impossible to understand any of the characters' motivations, and it doesn't seem like any of the immensely talented cast knows what they are, either. Is an indefinitely delayed vacation really the cause of the rift between John Goodman and Diane Keaton? Is a longstanding jealousy of her older sister really the root of Marisa Tomei's kleptomania? What is it about Amanda Seyfried that makes Alan Arkin go to a restaurant that he dislikes every single morning just to see her? None of these questions (and more) are ever answered. Instead, we get scene after scene of arguments and belittling, and we wonder why any of them bother. I know you can't choose your family, but if these were my relatives I'd just as soon spend Christmas alone.The best and (somehow) worst of these interlocking stories features Olivia Wilde and relative newcomer Jake Lacy. We are told (by the dog) that Wilde's heart has been broken too often, and now she has up a wall. She is a free-spirited, agnostic Liberal who, naturally, shares an airport bar with a conservative Christian soldier who is about to ship off. They instantly hit it off, despite the fact that she does nothing but demean his faith and politics, while he offers nothing but dumb defenses of his beliefs. Lacy actually does an admirable job of creating a charming, sincere character. But Wilde is so nasty to him that it makes no sense that he would fall for her (other than the fact that she's gorgeous). Their conversation is where the writer obviously felt like he could display his chops, but what he surely thought sounded profound comes off as ridiculous. For instance, Lacy asks what Wilde believes in if not God, and she responds ""I believe in Nina Simone's voice"". A loud ""OH COME ON!"" left my mouth before I was able to control it. What is that supposed to mean? Is that what passes for profound? For reasons that are not obvious, the considerate Christian soldier pursues the obnoxious hippy chick even after running into the married man with whom she's been sleeping. It's inexplicable.The title, ""Love the Coopers"", refers to the salutation the matriarch writes on the family's annual Christmas card. But, because the necessary comma is left off, it becomes a command. We are instructed to love these awful people despite having no legitimate reason to do so. I genuinely cannot think of a single reason you should watch this.",Love the Coopers

I would say that I was pleasantly surprised by the great ensemble cast in this movie. Each main character had his/her own little story; stories that will either touch your heart, make you smile or laugh. Even though I feel like Diane Keaton plays the same character in most of her films :P I think she did really good in this one. The other two that really stood out for me in the movie were Marisa Tomei and Olivia Wilde but each character had their moments in the movie so I doesn't seem like someone got left out in the overall story. It's not a perfect Christmas movie but this is definitely worth watching in the theater this Holiday season. I've seen a lot of Christmas movies and this is not the cheesy type that sometimes you see on channels like Lifetime. It's something that I could watch again so also I'd get a copy of the DVD when it comes out and add it on my list of great Christmas movies. I highly recommend the movie.",Love the Coopers

Very gloomy film",1,2 January 2016,"I went to see this film before Christmas and when I saw the trailer for it, I expected it to be a comedy and full of laughs. How wrong I was. I'm not usually the one who leaves the cinema disappointed but on this occasion I was, in fact for the first time ever I was close to walking out before the film had finished it was that depressing but I paid a lot of money to see it so I had to see it through. The plot itself was very confusing on how the characters were connected, it just dragged out too much I just lost focus by the end. Most of the characters on there just argued most of the time throughout the film over stupid things. There was one scene that shocked me the most and it was the Amanda Seyfried character who appeared to have been self harming herself judging by the slash mark on her wrist. That was not something I expect from the Christmas film. I took my sister to see it who is disabled and I often take her to cinemas, lucky she didn't understand what was happening but she later told me she didn't enjoy the film, I made it up to her a few days later and took her to see the Peanuts film which was much better. Christmas used to be a happy time of year but these days it's just all doom and gloom. I don't think I'll ever watch a new Christmas film again, I'll just stick to the old faithfuls. When it comes out onto DVD and Blu Ray next year, don't waste your money on it. Just download from Netflix and see for yourself how awful it is.

I love the schmaltzy, W-Network holiday movies, and my impression from the trailer was that this movie would fall into the same category. How wrong I was! This movie should not have been marketed as a ""comedy"", since there were very few laughs. The movie revolves around an extended family, all with various issues, on their way to the family Christmas dinner. It was confusing to keep it straight how everyone fit into the family (for example, I kept thinking that Marisa Tomei's character was matriarch Diane Keaton's daughter, when in fact, is her sister!). At any rate, I felt little connection or sympathy to any of the characters, and didn't find myself caring whether things worked out for them or not.

127,stroebeld,This Movie is a Mess,3,20 November 2015,"My biggest complaint about the movie is that the previews made it look like it was a lighthearted comedy. My wife and I thought it might be something like Love Actually, which has serious/poignant moments, but is also pretty funny. In this movie there were some good moments between characters like Arkin's character and the young waitress, between Wilde's character and the military guy, and between Goodman's and Keaton's characters, but these dark complicated situations were handled with overly-simplistic, unrealistic, cartoon-level solutions. I thought any of these three plot lines might turn in to something good, but none of them really did. I gave it three stars just because there were small moments where you thought *just maybe* they'll be able to make something good out of this, but the last quarter of the movie was just ridiculous, like they ran out of money and just put a bow on it. If you are looking for lightheartedly holiday fare or family entertainment, this is not it.",Love the Coopers
128,rizzocr-33093,Choppy and formulaic,2,10 November 2015,"This RomCom lacks both humor or romance. One may say it's a dark comedy, but mostly it's just sad. Bits of progressive manifesto are sprinkled throughout the movie with an uneven hand that screams same old formula with a new 21st century face. The main issue with the film is that there are too many story lines, most of which are never worked to denouement. We are left wondering, in many cases, why parts are even added. Then, there are parts which makes you question, why was that even necessary? Tiresome retread characters are abound - see the borderline case of dementia with constant sage lines. Please, I have grandparents with dementia, either don't make light of the issue or don't try to line it with clear one liner tear-jerker intended lines. Thanks but no thanks, I can't recommend this movie.",Love the Coopers
129,laurae-86720,Horrible!,1,12 November 2015,"I have NEVER been so mad for spending money on a movie. 'Love the Coopers' was by far THE worst movie I've ever seen. I was so confused while watching this movie because the storyline was absolutely HORRIBLE! After watching the whole movie, I'm still confused as to what it was about. I think one of the reasons I'm so upset is because so many actors that I adore were hired for this movie, therefore I expected it to be awesome, when in reality, it sucked. Throughout the whole movie, I think I laughed about 7 times, and all 7 of those times were shown in the trailer. The rest of the movie was boring, childish, confusing, and stupid! This was truly one of the worst written movies, and I feel bad for the actors who were in it. I'm telling you, do NOT waste your money on this movie. You will regret it!",Love the Coopers
130,lucymay-14763,A holiday movie that will make you laugh and cry!,8,13 November 2015,"I just joined IMDb just to rate this movie after seeing such negative reviews on here. It's a classic tale of a family with issues just like the rest of us! Here's the deal: if you enjoyed The Family Stone or Love Actually, this is definitely the movie for you! It was the perfect matinée to put us in the holiday and family spirit after some lunch and shopping. As a bonus, it'll be even better to watch over and over again once it comes to DVD! Definitely an awesome job with casting and the out - takes at the end were fun to watch. I already love Diane Keaton and John Goodman, but this made an Alan Arkin fan out of me! I give it an 8.5! P.S. If you're a pet lover, you are in for a treat as well!",Love the Coopers
131,sudsbhatt,"Feel good movie, slow but funny and heartwarming.",8,6 December 2015,"Great film. No blockbuster but if you want to go out for a nice family Christmas movie that leaves you feeling good and happy this is it. Far, far better than the puerile and offencive the night before.... My kids were less enthused as the storyline is more relevant for middle aged parent and married couples as the movie demonstrates the reality how couples grow apart and that certain things do continue to linger over the years in a relationship and these small irritations develop into major destructive ones over time. John Goodman and Ed Helms are great as is 13. It's all about brothers and sisters and mums and dads and siblings and how we all rub along and get along and do love each other even though we get annoyed by them from time to time. Diane Keaton continues to irritate as in her other recent movies.",Love the Coopers
132,evelinka-03969,Awuful!!!!,1,12 December 2015,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***That was the first movie that put me to sleep. For the first time in my life I wanted to leave the cinema. I went to see a Christmas comedy and saw Christmas tragedy. Such a stupid plot!!! Why all these people should be so sad and depressed?! I get the main idea of all miserable members of this family getting united at the end. BUT i can't understand why is necessary to be such slow and dramatic storyline. The main characters with their 35 years old marrage are going to devorse because they didn't go to Africa. They had so much fights all the time because of that and when the woman said ""Ok, let's go to Africa"", he said ""No, let's stay"" Really?!?! The sister Emma... she was at the back seat of the police car for 70 minutes and was having such pathetic conversation with the officer; the movie is 105 minutes! The daughter... why she and the soldier guy were walking around the airport for 50 minuts of the movie, talking so much nonsense? She is so much hurt and couldn't love again, but she has a ralationship with married man and she fall in love with the solider boy in 5 minutes... There is a son that couldn't buy a presents for his kids because he has no money but he is hiding that fact, there are two terrible teenagers making out in every corner, there is this waitress that tried to kill herself because he mother is an alcoholic... This movie killed my Christmas spirit :( The trailer is far away from the real story. People, please don't watch it, it will depress you... P.S. The only nice thing in this movie is the cute dog",Love the Coopers
133,araalnasser,Of course we love the coopers,10,5 January 2016,"This was the best Christmas movie I've ever seen. A movie with a great cast. It had it all comedy, drama, Christmas spirit and an ""openminded"" set. I could relate to the characters in the movie which pulled me further into the story. The way the characters were introduced was neither time wasted nor boring, but had great detail that could easily be analyzed. Further more the audience get to know the characters overtime. The movie covers family support in light of the Christmas spirit, a cliché? Yes! but the execution of the movie was done in a remarkable way such that it was entertaining and fills you with laughter, love and more. The songs used during the movie were impeccable. They harnessed the Christmas spirit and directed it to the audience. I highly recommend this movie, It's a must watch during the holidays. It was a realistic movie and shows that ""all families are imperfectly perfect"" Thank you,",Love the Coopers
134,liambanister,Don't Waste Your Time,1,28 November 2020,"It has the billing to be an amazing film with a star studded cast. Unfortunately, the storyline was written by a pubescent teenager. Multiple boring and ironic stories all come to one at Christmas. All doom and gloom throughout the movie and then everything works out at the end. Far too predictable and easy. Storylines are rushed and aren't believable. If you want to see how good this movie could've been, I suggest you watch Love Actually",Love the Coopers

136,garymarshall-39581,Diabolical,1,1 November 2020,"One of the worst movies to grace our screens , which is disappointing for such a great cast.. if your looking for a good Christmas movie then I beg you to stay away from this.",Love the Coopers
