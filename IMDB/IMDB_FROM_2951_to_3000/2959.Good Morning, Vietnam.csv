0,bkoganbing,Goooooooooooooooooooood Morning Preston Sturges,8,30 June 2009,"It finally hit me when I watched Good Morning Vietnam what this film reminded me of. It was the famous Preston Sturges classic, Sullivan's Travels which coincidentally as it turns out is one of my favorite films.Both the real life Adrian Cronauer and Joel McCrea's fictional John L. Sullivan have to come to the same realization, that what they do matters a great deal. In Sullivan's Travels it's to the movie going public in general, in the case of Cronauer it's to the GIs in Vietnam stuck in a war where no one could ever know who the enemy was. A few laughs from a comic genius was necessary to get them through the day in their very cockeyed world.Adrian Cronauer was a real life person, but if he didn't bear a resemblance to Robin Williams, he should have. One of the great comic masters of any era in entertainment, Robin Williams is given full range for his zany sense of humor to work its magic with Cronauer. He's ably abetted and assisted by the other staff members of Armed Forces Radio Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl. Bruno Kirby is great as the clueless lieutenant in charge and so is J.T. Walsh who represents the limits of the military mind as the sergeant major out to get Williams by hook or very dirty crook.Williams himself doesn't understand the complexities of the Vietnam situation. That fact is brought home to him graphically when he's betrayed by his own innate decency.Next to Williams my favorite in the cast is Noble Willingham who plays the general who has overall charge of Armed Forces Radio there. He's a tough, but compassionate military man, the exact opposite of J.T. Walsh whom he has to reign in.Good Morning Vietnam is a frank portrayal of a war experience told with humor and irony through the eyes of Robin Williams.Preston Sturges would have absolutely adored this film.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
1,SnoopyStyle,more than a simple Robin Williams rant,8,12 November 2013,"Director Barry Levinson takes a more comedic take on the Vietnam war like other great war comedies such as MASH. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is the new DJ in a stiff Armed Forces Radio. Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) is his best friend and Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is the humorless superior. Adrian's life gets more complicated as he falls for a Vietnamese girl and befriends her brother.Robin Williams is doing his crazed manic persona. He lets his mouth run wild. Some of it work great. Some of the humor is era sensitive. How funny is a Lady Bird Johnson joke today? But how funny was it back in the 80s? Luckily, there is a story behind the crazy wise-cracking Robin Williams rants. The story works well with a good performance from the Vietnamese brother played by Tung Thanh Tran. But it is all Robin Williams and he shows that maybe he could be a great actor for the first time.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
2,Prismark10,Here's Robin,6,1 August 2013,"Robin Williams found fame on television with Mork & Mindy but his early foray into movies was hit and miss.Williams had yet to have a vehicle where his brand of humour can go at full flow. Good Morning Vietnam was it. The story is loosely based on the experiences of Armed Forces Radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.By playing the DJ, Williams could free-wheel it on the mic, provide laughs and annoy the authorities in this case Bruno Kirby who certainly does not get his humour. He and JT Walsh conspire to get him off the air. These two certainly did not want soldiers to be happy.As the story progresses you get some drama, but it's not quite the horrors of the Vietnam war in the way films such as Platoon would show it.After all this is still a comedy and the drama is secondary.This was Williams movie where he could be anarchic. It started a run of performances in comedy and drama that rewarded him with an Oscar a decade later.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
3,classicsoncall,"""Lock 'n loll, baby! Lock 'n loll!""",7,20 May 2019,"If you ever witnessed a Robin Williams interview after he broke out his Mork from Ork character, you'd know that he took his manic persona into overdrive whenever he appeared on variety or talks shows of the era. It always struck me that he couldn't do enough to outdo himself, to the point that sometimes he looked like he was trying too hard. His character here, airman Adrian Cronauer, is sort of representative of what I'm talking about, whenever he's quipping on the radio or doing a version of stand up while stuck in military motor traffic. The movie is definitely an anti-war vehicle, cleverly disguised as a Robin Williams comedy, or as close to comedy as you can get while bringing the Vietnam War to the big screen. That stunning sequence of napalm ignited jungle juxtaposed with the lyrics of Louis Armstrong's 'It's a Wonderful World' creates just the sort of conflicted emotions the film is expected to arouse in the viewer, while the consequences of Cronauer's relationship with the young Vietnamese Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) brings the horror of war into direct focus for one so unsuspecting. Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh bring a callous naivete to their roles as Cronauer's clueless superiors, and after the film was over, I though a more suitable ending would have had Cronauer reassigned as a DJ to a radio station in Guam. That would have been right after General Taylor (Noble Willingham) sent Sgt. Major Dickerson (Walsh) there to temper his rigidity as an officer. Would have served him right.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
4,gavin6942,Much more hyped than it really deserves.,6,4 September 2009,"Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a real-life DJ stationed in Vietnam. He confronts authority and does what he can to defend the Vietnamese people, while befriending one man and trying to date his sister with moderate success. And then things go downhill.I can sum this movie up in one sentence: Robin Williams is not funny. The film is full of him ad-libbing voices where he's a homosexual, or a redneck or referencing people that were probably forgotten in 1987, and definitely today. He's decent as an actor when not trying to be funny, but every attempt at humor falls flat. To make matters worse, people in the background are literally falling out of their chairs with laughter... I don't think so.Forest Whitaker is in this, and plays more or less no role other than to follow Cronauer around and be a somewhat dim-witted sidekick who can't ride a bike or start a jeep properly. That's unfortunate that Whitaker was sidelined for Williams.You've most likely seen this film, as it has aired on television a million times in the past twenty years. I avoided it, and only came to view it by random happenstance. This was, as it turns out, a mistake, and I was right to avoid it. (Also, if you have any interest in real Vietnam War history, the actual Cronauer makes it clear that Williams did not portray him even remotely accurately.)","Good Morning, Vietnam"
5,lee_eisenberg,good morning and (a very good) day,10,12 January 2006,"""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is truly Robin Williams at his best. As anarchic DJ Adrian Cronauer in 1965 Saigon, he makes sure that you never stop laughing. I really liked what he did with the tape of Richard Nixon's speech, and then his comment about the bombing of a restaurant. Most amazing is that he ad-libbed the whole thing (but hey, that's Robin Williams). Maybe Cronauer wasn't that wacky in real life, but every one of Williams' comments makes the movie worthwhile. The soundtrack even includes his monologues (you'll go crazy over the imitation of Lyndon Johnson, and the commentary from ""Roosevelt E. Roosevelt""). A comedy classic in every sense.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
6,jboothmillard,"Good Morning, Vietnam",6,7 September 2005,"I saw the clip of the leading actor shouting the catchphrase title, and eventually watched it during my time at college, and I'm glad I got see it again to get a proper opinion, directed by Barry Levinson (Diner, The Natural, Rain Man, The Bay). Basically, set in 1965 during the Vietnam War, Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer (Golden Globe winning, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Robin Williams) arrives in Saigon to work as a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. Private Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) takes him to the radio station and is introduced to Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruce Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). Cronauer's show, which opens with his catchphrase ""Good morning, Vietnam!"" consists of reading strictly censored news and irreverent humour segments mixed with rock and roll music, which is frowned upon by his superiors. Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines and Dickerson is generally abusive to all men. But Cronauer and his show become very popular with the troops, Brigadier General Taylor (Noble Willingham) and his fellow DJs, including Sergeant Marty Lee Dreiwitz (Batman's Robert Wuhl). Whilst exploring the streets, Cronauer is infatuated with a Vietnamese girl named Trinh who attends an English class. He tries to talk to her but is confronted by her brother Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran). Croneaur tries instead to befriend him, only for two soldiers to get into a brawl with him. One afternoon, while relaxing in Jimmy Wah's, a local GI bar, Croneaur steps outside, two soldeiers are killed and he is shaken after the building explodes, caused by a bomb. Dickerson censors the news, but Croneaur locks himself in the studio and reports it anyway, outraging Dickerson. Dickerson cuts off the broadcast and Cronauer is suspended, to the delight of Hauk and Dickerson. Hauk takes over the show, but his bad humour and choices of music are unpopular and many letters and phone calls come demanding that Croneaur is reinstated. Feeling down, Cronauer spends his time drinking and pursuing Trinh. At the radio station, Taylor intervenes, ordering Hauk to reinstate Cronauer, but he refuses to go back to work. Garlick and Cronauer's vehicle is stopped by congestion caused by a convoy of soldiers. Garlick persuades Cronauer to do an impromptu ""broadcast"" before the troops are due to fight in Nha Trang. The soldiers appreciation reminds Cronauer why the job is important, and he returns to work. Dickerson seizes an opportunity to permanently rid himself of Cronauer by approving his request to interview soldiers in the field. Whilst travelling, Cronauer and Garlick's Jeep hits a mine, and they are forced to hide from Viet Cong patrols. In Saigon, Tuan realises Cronauer did not show up at the English class and steals a van to go after them. After finding Cronauer and Garlick, the van breaks down and they manage to board a helicopter to take them back to the city. Back at the base, Dickerson tells Cronauer that he is off the air for good after Tuan is revealed as a VC operative and is responsible for the bombing. Dickerson has arranged for Cronauer's honourable discharge, and General Taylor is unable to help him as his friendship with Tuan could damage the reputation of the US Army. After Cronauer leaves, Taylor informs Dickerson that he is being transferred to Guam, citing his vindictive attitude as the reason. Cronauer chases down Tuan, who explains that his actions against the Americas were retaliation against the U.S. army devastating his hometown, resulting in the deaths of family and friends. Before disappearing back into the jungle, Tuan reminds Cronauer that he did save his life despite this, implying that their friendship was true. On his way to the airport with Garlick and MP escort, Cronauer visits the English class for a quick softball game, with the MPs joining in, and says goodbye to Trinh. He gives Garlick a taped farewell message and boards the plane to take him back home to Queens. Garlick takes Cronauer's place as DJ, and plays the tape on air the next morning, which opens with Cronauer saying ""Goodbye, Vietnam!"" Williams gives a terrific performance that suits his rapid-fire improvisational stand-up comedy style perfectly, including funny voices and impressions. It is based on a true story, it is funny at the right moments, it has a good soundtrack of 1960s music, especially the clever use of juxtaposition, using the happy song ""What a Wonderful World"" by Louis Armstrong during the explosions and tragedy of the war, and it is serious and dramatic when it needs to be, it is a worthwhile black comedy war drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 31 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 100 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Good!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
7,ma-cortes,Entertaining and fascinating movie about a frenetic Disc Jockey during Vietnam War,7,9 January 2012,"An unorthodox DJ begins to shake up things when he is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam ; it is based on real life Adrian Cronauer . An impulsive new Disc Jockey named Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams), on whom story was based , is shipped from Crete to Vietnam to bring humor to Armed Forces Radio. The irreverent radio man turns the studio on its ear and becomes wildly popular with the soldiers , realizing uproarious monologues but runs afoul of the middle management (J.T. Walsh , Bruno Kirby ,Robert Wuhl) who think he isn't G.I. enough . D J brings rock 'n' roll to troops during that period when the Vietnam War matured from its origins into a full-blown war as he briefly ruled Saigon's Armed Forces Radio in 1965 . While Adrian is off the air accompanied by his aide-de-camp (Forest Whitaker) attempts to meet Vietnamese especially women , and results to have brushes with the actual war that never appears on the radio.It's a stunning and absorbing story that is based on real events and historical deeds . The storyline tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding. The film is a Robin Williams recital as he realizes a splendid portrayal of a frantic disc jockey as he plays , sings , stooges, tongue twister and pulls faces and grimaces . It's a farce with the master comic pretty amusing and with several wonderful songs from the 60s . Robin copped a first rate acting , achieved a lot of success and a well-earned nomination for best main actor . Williams' improvisational manic monologues are the spotlights and carry the film in an interesting story which meanders too much . Ideal main cast is completed by phenomenal secondary actors as J.T. Walsh , Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham and also shines Bruno Kirby as jealous superior. Marvelous musical score by the classic Alex North -Cleopatra,Spartacus- , including relevant musical interludes . Coloristic cinematography by Peter Sova , the outdoors filmed in Thailand are spellbound and breathtaking . The motion picture is compellingly directed by Barry Levinson -Sleepers, Bugsy, Avalon- . This is a highly amusing and frequently funny War/drama/comedy romp with a witty script specifically aimed an adult audience . Picture is a vehicle Robin Williams , he's the whole show , he's an outrageous comic and real Farceur. If you like Robin's crazy interpretation , you will most definitely enjoy this one . Well worth watching for enjoyable performances from main cast as well as the warfare buffs who also will like it . Rating : Very good , worthwhile watching and better than average .","Good Morning, Vietnam"
8,blanche-2,great improv by Williams,8,15 April 2012,"""Good Morning Vietnam"" is the story of Adrian Cronauer - well, that's how it started out - until Robin Williams got his hands on it. The real Cronauer actually didn't employ humor in his broadcasts. But I'm sure he was very happy to have a star such as Robin Williams interested in his story.In the '60s, Cronauer is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam and finds it pretty dull with a lot of boring music playing. He immediately shakes things up with his broadcasts, which begin GOOD MORNING Vietnam. He makes a lot of jokes, plays a lot of rock music, and infuriates some of the powers that be with his total irreverence. He also develops a crush on a young woman (Chintara Sukapatana) and follows her one day to an English class. He ends up teaching some of the more colloquial phrases to the class, which is delighted, and he becomes friendly with the young woman's brother (Tung Thanh Tran). He starts hanging out at a local bar and even gets used to the food.Despite his immense popularity, the waves he is making threaten to get him drummed out, as he is unhappy about censored news and one day mentions a tragedy that occurred on the radio. Slowly, Cronauer sees more of the war, meets soldiers going into combat, and learns the hard way that he can't trust everyone, and he gets a big-time reality check.Filmed in Thailand, Good Morning, Vietnam is a really excellent film that combines comedy with drama, improvisation with a solid script and manages to show the horror of war and its effect on the citizens and soldiers.Williams, who improvises all of the radio shows, is marvelous as Cronauer, here a man who uses humor in his life until he is faced with some harsh truths -- and even then, in one of his darkest moments, he finds his sense of humor again. Forrest Whitaker, as a soldier working at the radio, gives a wonderful performance. As Lt. Steven Hauk, Bruno Kirby is brilliant as a delusional man who thinks his groan-worthy sense of humor and Mantovani music is just the ticket for a radio show.Well worth seeing by baby boomers for the nostalgia value (though not all good) and by anyone to appreciate the skills of Robin Williams as an actor and comic.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
9,michaelRokeefe,"Funny, touching and very interesting war story.",7,6 January 2001,"Barry Levinson mixes rock 'n' roll and comedy with the Viet Nam conflict. This movie makes Robin Williams a 'big' screen star. Airman Adrian Cronauer(Williams)is assigned to an Armed Forces Radio station in the DMZ. He brings with him an irreverent, crude, and some times lewd comedy to the air waves. He plays a real good selection of 60's tunes and brings a piece of home to his listeners. Several of his commanding officers don't agree with his style of comedy and wish that he take his rapid-fire wit and banter elsewhere. Of course, the war goes on and so does life.This ensemble cast also features: Forest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby, Robert Wuhl and J.T. Walsh.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
10,studioAT,Robin Williams at the microphone,4,18 October 2015,"Good Morning, Vietnam was one of Robin Williams' first movie roles and perhaps one of his best.The reason for this really is the fact that the character he plays allows him to channel both his manic stand up comedian side and also allow him to show just how good a dramatic actor he could be given the chance.This film manages to combine that humour without being neglecting the story of the war that was going on at the time. The laughs are aren't but then again so are the moments that really do shock.While not my favourite Robin Williams film I still accept that this was one of the occasions where the great man was at his best.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

12,hitchcockthelegend,"""Good morning, Vietnam."" What the heck is that supposed to mean?",8,26 August 2009,"In a move designed to hopefully boost the morale of the troops in Vietnam, DJ Adrian Cronauer is sent to Saigon to rock the airwaves. He does, in more ways than one, and as the madness of the war takes hold, Cronauer, his superiors and those closest to him, are all about to get taught some life lessons.Based on the story of real life army disc jockey Adrian Cronauer, Good Morning Vietnam plonks us straight into Saigon in 1965. Before Cronauer's arrival at the radio station, the harried and weary American troops had been served a diet of boorish drone music and droopy health awareness programmes. Cronauer tore down the schedules and cranked out the likes of The Beach Boys, James Brown and Motown standards, all linked by Cronauer's spitfire patter and propensity for close to the knuckle humour. All of which made Cronauer a hero to the listening troops and a foe of the top brass. Enter Robin Williams as Cronauer.Finally getting a vehicle to showcase his scattergun improvisation talents, Williams goes full tilt to make Cronauer a part of 1980s pop culture. Most of the studio scenes are just Williams let loose by director Barry Levinson. Given free rein {Levinson merely picked out the best bits from reams of tape} to poke fun at anything remotely military. So much so, the radio station sequences have a unique feel of exuberance about them, so really it's inevitable that when the film moves away from the station it's going to be something of a shift in mood. During these shifts Cronauer is involved in a would be romance, a friendship with a teenage Vietnamese boy, a teaching arc and dalliances with his sidekick Edward Garlick {an excellent Forest Whitaker}. Whilst the dialogue remains zippy and humorous, the film is suffering because of its radio station high points, and the finale is as divisive today as it was with audiences back on release.However, the film remains a joyous viewing in spite of its irritants, and it should be noted that in amongst the jollification, Levinson is affording the Vietnamese people respect by way of portraying them as cultured and complex folk. How many Vietnam War film directors can say that I wonder? Backing up Williams and Whitaker is a cringe worthy turn from Bruno Kirby, with added weight coming in the form of an uptight J.T. Walsh. Nicely shot in Bangkok and Phuket by Peter Sova, scored appropriately by Alex North, and containing a delightful foot tapping soundtrack, Good Morning Vietnam overcomes its flaws and delivers something of a debatable 80s classic. 8/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"
13,Theo Robertson,The Comedy Should Have Been Blacker,6,6 July 2003,"For the most part I did enjoy GOOD MORNING VIETNAM but I can`t help feeling that it would have been a great film if there was a more cynical darker edge to the comedy with more lines like "" You mean we should escalate the war so we can get bigger names ? "" or Adrian Cronauer`s interview with the make believe intelligence officer . That said the scene with Adrian meeting and entertaining the young draftees going off to war is haunting just because it`s so understated while the montage of Vietnamese villages burning against the soundtrack of What A Wonderful World is intrusive because of its sledgehammer unsubtlety - And lets not forget Michael Moore made a career out of this scene . The cast are fairly good with Robin Williams giving one of his better in your face performances while Forest Whittaker plays his role in his usual affable likable way and Bruno Kirby is very memorable as Lt Hauk the laughably unfunny DJ .So a fairly good take on the Vietnam war from a different perspective , but I couldn`t help thinking it should have been to `Nam what MASH was to Korea","Good Morning, Vietnam"
14,preppy-3,It's pretty good,7,13 February 2007,Based (very loosely) on a true story. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is sent to Saigon in 1965. He's a radio DJ and is sent there to boost the morale of the troops. His off the wall manner on the radio and jokes make him very popular--but he meets opposition from obnoxious Sgt. Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) and stupid Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). Then he falls in love with a Vietnamese woman and realizes he can't just ignore the violence all around him.This was a huge hit in 1987. This is the movie that made Williams a star. I loved it back then but not so much now. Williams' rantings on the radio really aren't that funny--the sequence where he entertains servicemen outside on trucks going off to combat has more laughs than anything else. Also this move shoves its sentimentality down your throat (it's no surprise this is a Disney picture). We hear these beautiful songs of the period over scenes of revolution and violence. Everything is painted in black and white. Walsh and Kirby are one-dimensional villains and Williams comes across as almost perfect.The acting is all good and Williams non-stop comedy bits are occasionally funny. But this movie just about grabs you by the throat and forces you to cry and just pours on the syrup. Worth seeing but no great shakes.,"Good Morning, Vietnam"

16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Funny and real,7,29 October 2005,"Let me be perfectly frank and say right away that I watched this to experience Robin Williams at his best. That guy has so much comedic talent, it's unreal. I mostly got what I expected from this movie... but I found that it also contained some truths about the Vietnam war. The movie has plenty to offer on both fronts. Any fan of Williams' comedy will definitely enjoy it, and I think most war-movie buffs will too... if they can keep an open mind, and accept a slightly different approach to the genre. The way the seriousness of war is underplayed for most of the film really works to enhance the effect of it when it is shoved right in our faces, when we are forced to acknowledge it. We forget how serious and all-consuming war is, just like Adrian had(not necessarily the real one, I know nothing of him except of what the film told me, and as far as I understand, that's not that accurate a portrayal of him), only to be confronted with it. More effective than several big war movies. The plot is very good. The pacing is great, the movie keeps moving pretty much all through the film. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is good pretty much all-round, and Williams proves once again that he can do drama just as well as comedy. The humor is typical Robin Williams. A very good film, and an unusual war movie. I recommend this to fans of Robin Williams and war movies. 7/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"
17,view_and_review,Lifting Soldier Morale,8,16 September 2019,"Vietnam was a hot topic in 80's film, even comedians such as Richard Pryor starred in Vietnam based movies. Good Morning Vietnam sidesteps the actual fighting to focus on a DJ in Vietnam: Adrian Cronauer (pronounced crone-our), played by Robin Williams. He was a fast talking funny personality that was on the edge of being a shock-jock. Perhaps some of the Army brass considered him a shock jock. Certainly, some of the upper ranking officers believed he was too risqué for the Vietnamese airwaves.It's amazing how important his presence was for the men fighting. He may have been the only real entertainment they got out there. Morale is a critical thing when you need a group of people to accomplish a goal. I'm sure you've heard of ""employee morale."" It's usually brought up when it starts to decline. It's brought up for a reason. High morale allows management or commanding officers to get more out of their people. Adrian Cronauer did that for the soldiers. He kept their spirits up with laughter. Many of them didn't ask to be there and many of them didn't want to be there, so the least that could be done was to make there tour bearable. Cronauer did that and then some. He didn't fire any shots, nor did he take a bullet, yet he was just as essential.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
18,evanston_dad,Typically Safe Levinson Film,6,20 June 2008,"The mid-1980s signaled a Vietnam revival in American cinema, and ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" was Barry Levinson's contribution. Though boasting a pretty decent and characteristically hyper performance by Robin Williams, the movie over all is fairly forgettable, mostly because Levinson has always specialized in fuzzy, safe films that don't have anything by which to distinguish them.Like many of the other Vietnam movies that came out around the same time, this one has a great soundtrack.Williams received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.Grade: C+","Good Morning, Vietnam"
19,AlsExGal,If Hawkeye was a DJ AND in the Vietnam War...,10,6 November 2016,"... he would be Robin William's portrayal of D.J. Adrian Cronauer in this film. This ended Robin William's long period of exile in purely comedic, and quite frankly, silly films that started back in 1980 with Popeye. His career up to this point paralleled Steve Martin's in many ways, because his past career as a stand-up comic - and let's face it Mork and Mindy just had him basically doing stand-up on the four year run of that TV show - had pigeon-holed him into doing films like ""The Survivors"" and ""The Best of Times"" where he was doing straight comedy with mediocre scripts.This role was tailor made for Williams, because when he does his thing as the morning DJ, it is his own impromptu brash brand of fast talking comedy that made him famous. I hear that the director just gave Robin an outline of what was going on and let him rip. Nobody is safe - not then ex-Veep Nixon, not Walter Cronkite, not LBJ's daughters. Plus there is a great soundtrack of the best of sixties music. So much so that they wind up playing a song that wasn't even written in 1965 - ""You Just Keep Me Hanging On"". To play against Willams' character is Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk who is not evil, he is just as square as he can be with no appreciation of Cronauer's humor or taste in music. I think we've all had bosses like this guy. For evil you have to go to J.T. Walsh as Sgt. Major Dickinson, who threatens and actually seems like he would enjoy sending Cronauer to his death in the jungles of Nam.Robin Williams gets to do some serious acting when he runs into the extreme censorship of the news that is done by the army - he doesn't get to report anything that isn't completely positive. And, up close and personal, he runs into the fact that ""the enemy"" includes the Vietnamese themselves, who are not so much hot on Communism as they are cold to the idea of being occupied by the Americans as they had been occupied by the French before.I can't tell you anymore than this without giving something away. Just realize that this film is not a complete laughfest - there is some serious stuff going on here too - and that is why it was perfect for Robin Williams' transition to serious roles. Highly recommended.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
20,Wuchakk,The other side of the Vietnam War – decent but overrated,6,12 May 2015,"Released in late 1987 when Vietnam films were popular, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" chronicles the real-life story of Airman Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) as a DJ in Saigon, 1965. While Cronauer is a hit with the troops he incurs the wrath of his superiors for what they consider irreverent and subversive tendencies. When he's off the air Cronauer pursues a cute Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) while befriending her brother (Tung Thanh Tran). Forest Whitaker plays Cronauer's friend at the station while J.T. Walsh and Bruno Kirby play his nemeses.While categorized as a war comedy, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is more of a war drama with amusing touches, simply due to Williams' antics. The film was a box office hit when it was released and hailed by critics. Roger Ebert, for instance, gave it a perfect rating. I didn't see it until a couple of nights ago – 27 years after its release – far removed from the hoopla of the period, and found it decent at best, although somewhat amusing. An example of the film's limitations can be seen when Cronauer performs in the presence of the troops in the second half; the sequence is somehow unconvincing. Nevertheless, there's an unexpected twist in the third act that piqued my interest and the movie is a necessary companion-piece to films like 1986's ""Platoon"" in that it provides the non-grunt, political side of the infamous conflict.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Thailand.GRADE: B-","Good Morning, Vietnam"
21,mm-39,Over rated,4,21 August 2002,"Williams runs at the mouth in this over serious comedy.  Rude and crude, and insulting over humorous dialog.  Maybe, Andrew Dice Clay could do better. Over rated, his comic bit, like in a club, sounds more like a tirade at the post office than humor.  No Caddy Shack, with the cholate bar in the pool humor.  Instead, the movie reminds me more of insults at work.  The ending is serious, and one needs to see a comedy after watching this film. 4/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"
22,JamesHitchcock,"Dark, satirical comedy that does for Vietnam what ""M*A*S*H*"" did for Korea",8,1 September 2008,"""Good Morning, Vietnam"" forms part of what may be called the cinema's Second Vietnam Cycle.

Hollywood then seemed to lose interest in the subject for a few years, but returned to it in the late eighties when there were a number of major Vietnam War films such as ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Hamburger Hill"", ""Casualties of War"" and Oliver Stone's trilogy of ""Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Heaven and Earth"".All those other films take a deeply serious look at the war, but ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is often regarded as a comedy, albeit a dark, satirical one. It essentially does for Vietnam what ""M*A*S*H*"" did for Korea. The film is set in 1965, and is loosely based upon the experiences of Adrian Cronauer, a DJ with American Forces Radio, during the Vietnam War. (The title comes from his habit of beginning every broadcast with an exuberant shout of ""Gooood Moooorning, Vietnaaam!"") The real Cronauer is a conservative Republican, but Robin Williams plays him here as a rebel against authority, although he is a rebel who, initially, has some support from the Army's top brass. It's the bottom brass who can't stand him. He is brought to Vietnam by a General who admired his broadcasts to American forces based in Crete. Cronauer, whose shows combine music with quickfire satirical comedy, proves immensely popular with the troops, but alienates his commanding officer, Lieutenant Hauk. Hauk dislikes his style of humour and the fact that he plays rock and roll instead of the likes of Mantovani, Perry Como and Andy Williams. Cronauer also makes an enemy of his immediate superior Sergeant Major Dickerson, who finds him insubordinate.As Roger Ebert has pointed out, the character of Cronauer undergoes considerable development in the course of the film as he begins to learn more about the war and about Vietnam itself. (That is, Vietnam the country as opposed to Vietnam the American foreign policy blunder). At first his irreverent humour is merely satire for satire's sake, but as time goes on it takes on a more questioning and more political tone. A key moment comes when Cronauer witnesses the bombing by the Vietcong of a Saigon bar which causes the death of a number of GIs. He wants to make reference to this incident in one of his broadcasts, but is prevented from doing so by Dickerson, who takes the view that if something is not ""official"" news it never happened. (Cronauer's situation is similar to that of Matthew Modine's Private Joker in ""Full Metal Jacket"", another film from the same year. Joker is a journalist on a military newspaper who becomes frustrated with his job, which he sees as dishonest, slanted reporting for propaganda purposes).Despite earning the enmity of Hauk and Dickerson, Cronauer is for a time protected by his patron General Taylor, who regards his broadcasts as being good for the men's morale. Cronauer's downfall eventually comes when he befriends a young Vietnamese man named Tuan, who turns out to be a Vietcong supporter. Even the General can no longer protect him, and Cronauer is discharged from the armed forces.Robin Williams started his career as a stand-up comedian, so he was a natural for the role of Cronauer. I have always regarded ""Dead Poets' Society"" as Williams' best film, but ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is a strong candidate for his next best, along with ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and ""One Hour Photo"". It brought him a well-earned Oscar nomination, although he lost out to Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"". Williams also receives excellent support from Forest Whitaker as Cronauer's friend Edward Garlick, Tung Thanh Tran as Tuan and J.T. Walsh as the arrogant bully Dickerson.There are some very amusing scenes, such as Cronauer's spoof Richard Nixon interview, and the one where he is teaching a class of Vietnamese students how to swear in English. There are also some brilliant lines; most of these are given to Cronauer (""No, we can't say ""dyke"" on the air, we can't even say ""lesbian"" anymore, it's ""women in comfortable shoes""), but some of the other characters join in. ("" I wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch and I consider him a good, close, personal friend""- General Taylor on Nixon). Even the normally humourless Dickerson gets to utter the memorable threat ""You better not even come within range of anything that happens or your ass is grass, and I'm a lawn mower"". ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is, in places, a very funny film, but it is also one that raises some serious issues about the war. 8/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"
23,namashi_1,A Very Good Film....,7,24 February 2010,"Barry Levinson directed biopic 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is a very good film, it's a super watch. Levinson brings us the life of the legendary D-J Adrian Cronauer who did all the funny stuff during the infamous Vietnam War way back in the 1960's. 'Good Morning, Vietnam' works because the journey we take, was real and it's hilarious. Levinson has mastered in Direction, he knows how to execute an important subject, his work is quite exceptional. A film that keeps you hooked in those odd 120 minutes. It's amongst the best I've seen from the 80's, a high-class film.'Good Morning, Vietnam' would've been a mark short if Robin Williams didn't appear in it. There is no Robin Williams here, it's Adrian Cronauer who takes us through his adventurous journey. There are some actors & then there is Robin Williams. The Veteran-Actor surpasses himself, this is his careers finest work to date. Take a bow, Mr.Williams! 'Good Morning, Vietnam' rules, it's a winner all the way. Now here's a film that not only depicts real life incidents, but also entertains & enlightens when it's over. Thumbs Up!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
24,StevePulaski,Let it be known that Robin Williams is a multi-faceted talent,9,8 September 2014,"Good Morning, Vietnam has the uncanny ability to surprise. At around the hour mark, I was convinced that the film, while funny and impossibly kinetic and energetic in tone and performance, was solely sticking to this act of energy, while maybe touching but not capitalizing at the apparent possibility of an emotional subplot. Sure enough, director Barry Levinson and writer Mitch Markowitz manage to work in a seriously believable and touching bout of sentimentality to a picture so manic one doubts that it could possibly fit comfortably inside of it. The film is the perfect blend of manic, disposable energy and tender drama that it becomes a film to seriously commend in many different departments.Robin Williams is at the film's core as Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer, who arrives in 1965 Saigon to work as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Station. He meets and takes a liking to the straight-laced and genial Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker), who also takes a liking to Cronauer after seeing what the man can do with a microphone and a broadcasting signal. Cronauer's radio broadcast, contrary from the archetypal and uninspired transmissions the bases were used to hearing, are irreverent and fun, with lively bursts of energy and unpredictable wit coming directly from the mind of its radio DJ. This leads him to be immensely controversial with his peers. However, Cronauer becomes supported and rejoiced by his students who attend his English language learning class on a frequent basis, proving that while he does things differently, the man has the incredibly ability to connect and to inspire.It should be dually noted that Williams exercised the practice of improvisation while performing his wild-and-out radio shows in Good Morning, Vietnam, for it shows extreme comic energy, timing, and capability. Williams indefatigably, zealously delivers monologues of true power during his radio shows, zipping by with unprecedented comedic speeds, with jokes so sneaky and quick that you're bound to miss at least a few. His character Cronauer doesn't even a cohost for his radio show, as he is the sole provider of such indescribable energy and fun in the film.Furthermore, Williams works to illustrate Markowitz' more sentimental and emotional second half, which isn't as emotionally manipulating as one would expect. Rather than carelessly paint a second half so somberly, immediately following a goofy but thoroughly enjoyable first half, Markowitz carefully constructs scenarios and characters for us to latch onto as likable souls victim to a senseless, brutal war. After an hour of Williams' rampant comedic delivery, despite it being incredibly enjoyable, I was expecting the entire film to only vaguely come to an emotional or even dramatically investing second half. As Markowitz goes on, however, he totally creates a wonderful climax and conclusion to the film.In addition, let it be known that Williams works tirelessly to detail the emotions necessary for the film to succeed. He transitions ever-so naturally from manic energy to humble and sentimental, effectively but commendably illustrating a drastic divide in emotions so beautifully. The performance at hand rightfully earned him an Oscar nod and affirmed a potentially skeptical audience of Williams' incredible on-screen energy.Starring: Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker. Directed by: Barry Levinson.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Rising Star: Robin Williams,8,12 January 2007,"The funny thing about this film, I really didn't hear too much about it, I had just read a lot about it in my film books and how this movie pretty much made Robin Williams what he is today. I love Robin Williams, he is one of the greatest comedic actors of our time and not to mention a terrific man who really gets involved in his charities, I have a lot of respect for him, so I figured that I should probably see this movie since I'm a pretty decent fan of his. While it wasn't as outrageous as Mrs. Doubtfire, it was still a fun and realistic movie that made you laugh and feel.Robin plays Adrien, a marine who has been brought to Vietnam actually for a radio show due to his comedic reputation and he blows his audience away with great sketches along with the best music of our time. But Adrien is also somewhat playing with fire when he decides to read ""unofficial"" news that shouldn't be broadcast according to the military, which disappoints Adrien since the audience is being held back from the truth. He also makes some Vietnese friends, one of which he finds out to be part of the enemy while he is in love with the enemy's sister.Good Morning, Vietnam really shined Robin William's talents and strength towards being a star. He and the cast brought together a great comedy mixed with very dark drama. It had great acting and a unique story that I'm sure that anyone could enjoy. While it's not really a true Vietnam movie, it's still a decent film that deserves a look. This film did terrific things for Robin, we owe it to this film for that.8/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"
26,DKosty123,Good Morning A Better Film Than Often Thought,8,26 December 2009,"At the time this movie was released, most viewers went to it expecting a straight comedy film because Robin Williams was a star on the hit sit-com Mork & Minday. The viewers were surprised because this movie accomplished more than that, & because of this got mixed reviews. It wasn't fair.The story is based upon the real life experience a DJ & what he did when he went to do armed forces radio in Vietnam. The accuracy of the tale gets lost because of the Hollywood Treatment but when you look at this film, it is very successful on an entertainment level, and the film is well made.Robin Williams comedy in this is very good. The surprise at that time is how solid his acting is. He is able to mix comedy and drama here in a very profound way considering this is one of his earlier films. Hollywood really has not served the memories of the Vietnam war accurately on any level so it is not a surprise that exists here.While great directors have made great films addressing Vietnam, there is a haze that still exists over their efforts because Vietnam & the reason for being there is especially now looking back, a mystery. It did serve one major change in the United States which has changed history.Vietnam more than anything else ended the compulsory military draft in the United States so far. That draft was a form of slavery Abe Lincoln had to invoke in order to win the civil war. It was never questioned until Vietnam. This movie doesn't really show why that happened, but it does try to tell the real story of someone who actually went to Vietnam & tried to make a difference.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
27,disdressed12,a movie set during the Vietnam war blending comedy and drama very well together,9,1 January 2007,"this is a highly entertaining movie,which flows very smoothly and moves at a good clip.it is based(although very loosely,but it works in this case)the exploits of unorthodox Radio Dejay,Adrian Cronoar.The movie stars Robin Williams As Cronaur and is set in Saigon during the Vietnam war.Cronaur brings his own unique blend of humour to the airwaves.nothing is off limits and everyone and everything Cronaur can think of is skewered in some way.Cronaur is wacky, manic and raunchy at times.this,of course upsets the sanitized and safe version of events allowed on the airwaves.naturally the troops in the field get a big boost of moral and they love Cronaur.the the top brass try everything they can to keep him in line with ""the program""(with hilarious results)and to get rid of him.the movie is not just comedy however.it contains some strong scones of drama,and is even touching at times,yet not maudlin or sappy. Williams was born to play this role and is brilliant as Cronaur.the supporting cast all put in great performances,as well.but credit must also go to director Barry Levinson,who keeps the flow of the movie intact.the dramatic scenes are handled very well,and as i said never drift into maudlin territory.and given the movie's sensitive subject matter,Levinson does very well at keeping the movie from crossing the line into bad taste.I really enjoyed this movie.it is well worth spending the 2 hours.a strong 9* out of 10","Good Morning, Vietnam"
28,sddavis63,One Of Robin Williams' Best,7,24 January 2014,"I find Robin Williams frustrating as an actor. He can be both very funny and he can pull off dramatic roles well. For such a versatile actor, though, he often ends up taking the parts he plays a little too over the top and can sometimes distract from the story. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" was a very good performance by Williams, though, which allowed him to display both his comedic and dramatic talents.Williams played military DJ Adrian Cronauer, who hosted an Armed Forces Radio show out of Saigon in the mid 1960's during the Vietnam War. Cronauer was an innovative DJ, trying to make military radio sound more like civilian radio back home. The military, however, is very steeped in tradition, and Cronauer's efforts weren't universally appreciated by the military brass, with whom he often butted heads.Williams did a good job as Cronauer the DJ. In fact, you could say that he was tailor made for the part. Having said that, the real life Cronauer acknowledges that he wasn't as over the top as Williams portrayed him. So the movie isn't a biography; it was made for entertainment purposes. I suspect that much of the dramatic content of the movie was fictional. It revolved around a Vietnamese woman who became Cronauer's love interest and her brother, who became Cronauer's best friend until he was discovered to have been a Viet Cong member.This is, perhaps surprisingly, a reflective movie at times, giving the opportunity for the viewer to think about the Vietnam War through a number of scenes. It's definitely one of Robin Williams' best performances, and he's supported by actors such as J.T. Walsh and Forest Whittaker. (7/10)","Good Morning, Vietnam"
29,ElMaruecan82,The (live-action) role Robin Williams was born to play...,8,13 July 2019,"""President Johnson says the situation in Vietnam will worsen before it improves""This is the last item of news we catch while we follow Adrian Cronauer's departure from Nam. We've laughed a lot with his crazy and hilarious antics but Lyndon Johnson provided the final punchline to the worst possible joke in a movie full of them: war itself.Calling war a joke is a cliché but it does seem that both humor and war (or politics) rely on absurdity, one taking the edge in the way it takes itself seriously. Whenever we read news about today's political leaders, aren't we all asking the same question after all: ""are they serious?"". A man said that the talent of a politician is to never answer the question, art is not to let them be asked, a comedian works differently: his talent is to ask the right questions, art is to pretend he doesn't even try. Comedians play, politicians dodge, that's the irreconcilable difference between the two worlds, intelligently explored in Barry Levinson comedy-drama ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" starring Robin Williams in the closest role to his real personality (and one of his best) as Radio Armed Services DJ Adrian Cronauer.Even the catchphrase ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" plays like a wake-up call to the troops, making Cronauer a sensation in 1965 and the target of a few petty officers disapproving his irreverent and raunchy humor. The film focuses on that internal battle with censorship a little more than the actual Vietnam war but to make an even more insightful statement about war, as if the script written by Mitch Markowitz illustrated that iconic statement from Clemenceau that war is too serious a matter to be left to military men. And maybe war is so tragic that extracting any humorous substance from it is the greatest tribute to the human spirit and Cronauer, the man who kept morals high in the infancy of the war with his puns, impressions and redundant ""Good Morning, Vietnaaaaam"" accomplished the closest thing to a heroic deed. He didn't save lives but saved them from boredom and alienation.Some people are just born to tell jokes, we forgive them for offending sensitivities because they do it with 'style' and they're so funny they never make it sound like something mean. And the movie draws that line between fun and mean-spiritedness from the way the troops and everyone around Cronauer reacts to his jokes, sometimes, his popularity is overplayed but Robin Williams is such a presence that he gives an extra aura of sympathy to Cronauer. In contrast, there's butt-monkey Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby) who doesn't get his vulgarity (he'd rather put Polka than Rock'n'Roll) and the fittingly called Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) who doesn't see from in a favorable light this man coming to stir anarchy, forgetting that even in WW2 vets had Tex Avery cartoons, Private Snafu's adventures and other stuff moral would usually reprimand.The film is full of fine supporting performances, including Cronauer's assistant Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker in his young nerdy years coming back from ""Platoon""), General Taylor (Noble Willingham) a comprehensive man who sees as a priority that his boys have a good time and is perhaps Cronauer's number one fan. And the film proves he's got a good taste, offering the most latitude for Robin Williams to showcase his talent with all the flamboyance and instinct for improvisation he's capable of: a pacing problem with a record, a reference to ""The Wizard of Oz"", anything leads to humor. This is certainly his greatest role with ""Aladdin in the sense that it encapsulates all his talent and energy without distracting from the mood of the film, he makes us laugh first so we can appreciate the serious moments.And as viewers, we're more interested to see complexities behind that jovial facade, and see how eventually humor was like a self-defense to cover some deep insecurities. And even that would have been too predictable, the film starts with a man everyone likes immediately but who doesn't have enough perspective on himself. He's slightly cynical, turns everything into a joke, and somewhat we never know what matters to him, he might be as ""annoying"" (for lack of a better word) as Robin Williams could be during interviews. Progressively, the film unveils his depths, he has a crush on a Vietnamese girl (Chintara Sukapatana), learns to get along with her brother (Tung Thanh Tran), he teaches Vietnamese people the American slang, befriends a restaurant owner and slowly, the mundane gets over the professional and we start to see the war (and the comedian) from a different perspective, allowing us to appreciate the drama besides the comedy.And the film features many montages mixing music of the era and the war as a backdrop, switching between the fun with Williams dancing to ""I Feel Good"", to the more famous ""A Wonderful World"" one of the film's most memorable moments. I'm not sure the film is always that effective when it states the obvious things such as war being hell or Cronauer good guy, but there's something so genuinely appealing in Williams' acting that we're able to see the sadness behind his smiles without ever feeling manipulated. Still, no matter how high Barry Levinson's ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" aimed in terms of hilarity, it reminds us at the end that humor takes its noblest meaning when it operates within an area that doesn't leave much for laughs; humor is like a dish served on a ugly plate.And perhaps the comedians are men capable to see the worst in humanity before they conjure it with their fun and humor, and maybe the best comedians are deeply the saddest and yet the most capable to give us happiness, like Williams did, like Cronauer did... improving things a little before the situation worsened.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
30,gbill-74877,Williams is brilliant,9,4 July 2019,"It's hard to imagine an actor more suited to a role than Robin Williams is to Adrian Cronauer in this film. He's wildly funny, subversive, and politically incorrect, but his humanity and heart really come through as well. My god, I miss him. Also funny is Bruno Kirby in his role as the not-funny Lieutenant who thinks he knows comedy. The film wisely avoided having Cronauer's relationship to the Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) proceeding beyond friendship, which showed a level of maturity and respect in the script. More importantly, I loved how it managed to capture a sliver of the American experience in Vietnam, which gives the film a haunting, bittersweet feeling amidst all of Williams's electric improvisation. Great film.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
31,g-bodyl,Robin Williams At His Best!,9,21 May 2014,"Good Morning, Vietnam is often a funny and witty movie thanks to the fast-speaking talent of Robin Williams. Williams delivered his lines at his usual rapid pace and that makes things all the funnier. But in order to effectively deliver the material, he needed a great screenplay and that's what he got. It delivers the goods and some of the lines are just funny. My favorite is when the film lambasts Richard Nixon. I was in hysterics.Barry Levinson directs a film about the fast-talking radio host named Adrian Cronauer who is sent to Saigon to be the funny on-air personality everyone is raving about. The brass may dislike him for his on-air antics, but he has gained the ears of the common soldier.This is the perfect role for Robin Williams. His approach to comedy is perfect for this role. Some people may find this annoying, but I was laughing very hard throughout. He's at best when he was on-air. His off-air scenes were good, but they were more considered melodrama than comedy.Overall, Good Morning, Vietnam is a very funny film thanks to the presence of Robin Williams. This can also be considered a war film, but it's a rather unusual take on war film. But with Vietnam still fresh on many people minds at this point, this was a good way to tell the story: with comedy. I rate this film 9/10.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
32,lesleyharris30,"Some of Williams Finest Work,",9,15 August 2012,"Good Morning Vietnam is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic cast. The movie is without a doubt some of Robin Williams finest work, one thing that he has proved to us over the course of his outstanding career is that he is great at doing both comedic and dramatic roles, he is given a chance to do both here. The highlights are certainly the scenes where he is hosting the radio show, it is very obvious that Williams got to improvise these lines and they are absolutely hilarious, the humour flies out of him very naturally, as well as a clear knowledge for the Vietnam war. There are some surprising twist and turns throughout that are exciting and take us deep in to the events of the war, many unexpected moments that really shocked me. Delivering both laughs and emotion, I would recommend Good Morning Vietnam to anyone looking for a good comedy, drama or war film. A DJ is assigned to the U.S. Armed Services radio station in Vietnam, however, his outrageous broadcasting style lands him in hot water.Best Performance: Robin Williams","Good Morning, Vietnam"
33,secondtake,"The best--Williams behind the mic--is 11 stars, but the movie as a whole is a kind of slick formula otherwise",7,13 September 2014,"Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)A lighthearted but deadly serious anti-war film, actually. This is of course a Robin Williams movie so that it is his schtick, brilliant and inspired, that makes it soar. The best of it, including the famous riff when he first gets on the air as the new Saigon DJ, is hilarious and breathtaking. There is a plot, sort of, as he goes through a rise and fall at the military radio station, but it's more about his shining moments behind the microphone than anything else.The ""else"" in this movie is, however, most of the movie. That is, Williams has a serious role as an offbeat renegade in a chaotic world surrounded by a range of sensible and very insensible officers and colleagues. At the most extreme, when we see a Vietnamese village firebombed while Louis Armstrong sings ""It's a Wonderful World,"" the sentiment is so cloying it makes you cry, and you're not sure why because you know it's just over the top manipulation. Likewise when Williams is caught in a traffic jam with other military vehicles and he warms up the soldiers by humanizing everyone and making them feel like they really should be back home. Which they should be, as we know in retrospect.So the movie has another side that's kind of sentimental and simplistic, whatever its good pacifist intentions. Williams is a decent actor—I'm not one of those who thinks he's brilliant outside of his funny roles—and so it holds up pretty well. But the plot line keeps the movie from really finding pathos, or comedy, or warmth, or tragedy of a dramatic kind, in the scenes outside the radio station. And I think that's what it intended.For those who don't know, it's worth adding that the main character, Adrian Cronauer, was a real person, and still is—he's a staunch Republican (Williams was not, to be sure) and an innovator in radio in Vietnam. He also co-wrote the screenplay, I assume working on the scenes that he would know best rather than the larger saccharine plot aspects. A great story, and the real Cronauer deserves credit for inspiring it, and helping it along. He was, along with most of us, ""Godsmacked"" when he heard the news of Williams's death.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

36,zkonedog,Heavily Reliant On The Robin Williams Magic,7,9 September 2020,"Despite being a fan of Robin Williams' unique brand of scattershot, stream-of-consciousness comedy, I had never seen ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" all the way through. While I am glad to have finally checked that off my watch list, I do have to say that it underwhelmed me a bit, especially when it comes to any historical or cultural significance outside of its leading man.For a very basic overview, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" tells the story of Adrian Cronauer (Williams), an Army Radio DJ assigned to a Vietnam station in 1965. While his non-conformist attitude ruffles the feathers of the higher-ups--especially Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby)--he quickly inspires fellow soldiers in every corner of the conflict.There is absolutely no doubt or denying that ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" sees Williams at perhaps the peak of his comedic zenith. Every single scene of him DJ-ing the station will have you laughing out loud. His fast-talking, reference-alluding style is so unique that it's sort of a one-of-a-kind experience. Personally, I very much consider this entire film to be little more than a showcase for his talents.Which leads me to the unfortunate part of this experience for me: aside from Williams, I really didn't get much else out of ""Good Morning, Vietnam"". While it is pretty clear what the writers and director Barry Levinson are trying to accomplish character-wise, it all seems a bit cloying, predictable, and sometimes even a bit cartoonish. The Army is inflexible, Williams is the fly in the ointment, and we all bemoan the pointlessness of the whole ordeal. Maybe this all hit a little closer to home in 1987, but watching in 2020 it felt a bit overcooked in terms of stereotypes.Overall, though, the sheer presence of Williams makes this a very watchable film, albeit perhaps a bit overrated from a historical perspective. Come for Williams, but your mileage may vary regarding the other material here.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
37,johnnyboyz,Really smart and somewhat humbling film that entertains and amuses.,8,23 September 2008,"Made at a time when films on the Vietnam war were being produced by America at a healthy rate, Good Morning, Vietnam comes across as the sort that falls into both 'types' that were being produced at the time. Platoon got under the skin of Vietnam, telling the events from an individual's perspective through voiceovers without relying on a lot of causality, rather the everyday tasks and events that occur. Full Metal Jacket was an interesting beast in the sense most of its more intense scenes didn't actually happen in Vietnam but rather at home on the training ground. But both were in a sensible tradition and took attention away from the Reaganism inspired 'action' films that were Rambo: First Blood Part II and the like.Good Morning, Vietnam falls into both these sorts of Vietnam war films. On one hand it is a serious film about the war and deals with serious issues such as morale and how dangerous conflict with the enemy actually is without doing what Rambo did by turning the war genre into a sub-division of the action genre. At one point in the film, DJ and lead character of the film Adrian Cronauer (Williams) finds himself in a hostile area out in the jungle and you do feel the shift in atmosphere the film briefly moves into in the sense this guy is not a soldier but he is in a dangerous position and he isn't equipped with how to get through it. There is another scene in which a street side bomb goes off and Adrian is caught up in the middle of it, further reminding us of the war zone and cleverly shifting the aura.But the film does fall into the genre of comedy and while it does so, it never distracts us from the fact this is taking place during a war unlike First Blood: Part II which could really have been an action film set amongst any backdrop. Good Morning, Vietnam does not ignore its comedy roots either and gives us genuinely entertaining disc jockey rants from Williams who shines with his animation and ad-libbing, further reminding us of a later film of his, Aladdin, and how he really was the star of that piece.The best parts of Good Morning, Vietnam actually raise issues to do with oppositional reading. As a character, Adrian is one of those charismatic individuals who is perhaps more focused on entertaining his audience first but when repercussions to do with that want to entertain arise, it is an oppositional reading to something that seems innocent enough. There are a couple of scenes and incidences that deal with this theme of oppositional reading. One that springs to mind takes place in a bar in which Adrian has brought a Vietnamese friend whom he teaches in an English class. The trouble is, it's a G.I. bar and certain soldiers have an issue with the Vietnamese person being there. It is Adrian's carefree and relaxed attitude to letting the individual come with him to the bar that has upset certain others around him, resulting in an oppositional opinion on whether the Vietnamese person should be allowed there. One says he can, others say he can't and conflict erupts.This battle is constantly going on within the boundaries of the radio studio and exists between Adrian and the censors who blank out all the bad news such as deaths and bombings, failing to deliver the real news, and instead keep morale from going below a certain point. Adrian's style of giving the people what they should hear in a charismatic style also rubs off spawning a sub-story revolving around a small school that teaches Vietnamese people the English language. Before hand, they were learning very basic words and phrases but after Adrian takes over, New York City slang or 'jargon' is the name of the game and while you wouldn't find English as a foreign language classes doing this sort of thing, Adrian brings his charismatic style to a class, turning it from formal to informal.The theme here is that he's giving them exactly what he feels they need to know, not what the curriculum demand they know. It is the same with the radio station and the news censorship; giving people what they have a right to know vs. what a higher power say they should know. The principal foil for Adrian is Lt. Steven Hauk (Kirby) who is against Adrian's style of parody and constant joking but when he is put on air, the best he can do is adopt the voice and role of a Frenchman as he mocks and plods his way through airtime. It is a battle that the oppositional readers loose since morale falls drastically after Adrian is taken off and he is forced to be reinstated because of this.Good Morning, Vietnam carries a pumping soundtrack which is what you'd expect for a film about a DJ and an emphasis on radio and its constant referencing to popular culture, gliding from The Wizard of Oz to Eleanor Roosevelt makes Williams' scenes consistently fun to watch. But other than this, it gives some political stances without ever feeling forced with the 'Wonderful World' montage over wartime action and juxtaposes James Brown's music over other scenes of wartime action. The film is a success in comedy and drama, a rarity of sorts given Dr. Strangelove supposedly set the standards.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
38,TheMovieDiorama,Good Morning Vietnam spews non-stop improvisational comedy live on air with some now questionable politics.,6,5 August 2019,"Regarded essentially as the self-titled ""one man Robin Williams show"", this comedy-drama is yet another addition to the saturated war genre of the 80s that depicted the Vietnam War. Only this time, instead of purely focusing on the conflict's brutality and overwhelming sense of American patriotism, it desires you to laugh instead. How many impressions can Williams do in one film? Far too many! That's all fine and dandy, considering it offers an entirely different perspective altogether, however Levinson forcibly involves poignant drama that never feels developed enough to convey evocative sentiments, consequently creating a jarring tone that ultimately doesn't suit the bustling chaos of Saigon. A radio DJ is recruited to host a show on Armed Forces Radio Service, but must deal with his infuriated superiors who believe him to be a loose cannon.Improvisation is a talent. It's the ultimate level of comedic power. To spew unscripted humour for minutes on end without the dialogue producing cumbersome stutters is, well, genius. That is why, and practically the sole reason why, this film works. Robin Williams was blindingly fantastic. Without him, the comedy dissipates. Without him, the contrasting demeanour and attitude against his colleagues wouldn't be as profound. Without him, Good Morning Vietnam would be shouting ""Goodbye"" instead. Various lines of unscripted dialogue were funny, if you can understand his riffing tempo which exceeds the speed of sound (subtitles anyone?), however it's the scripted lines from Markowitz that anchored the comedy down to realism. It prevented Williams from becoming irreverent and overly hyperactive, a necessary juxtaposition to tackle the more poignant moments.Unfortunately, despite the solid cast, soundtrack and comedy, it's Levinson's direction and Markowitz' overly dramatic plot details that prove futile. There's a fine line between comedy and cultural appropriation. Constantly remarking Vietnamese civilians as stereotypically short, no matter how well-intentioned the dialogue may be, prevents the film from ageing well. It's on the boundary of being deemed as insulting, and I'm not one for condoning that behaviour, especially for comic relief. Sure, times have changed, but that doesn't necessarily mean I have to agree with the previous tolerance for appropriation.Next, is the embedding of cultural exploration. The apparent poignant dramatic elements arise from the protagonist randomly seeking out a Vietnamese woman and desiring her adoration. This then allowed Levinson to depict Vietnamese culture, as all war films did back then, yet in the most uninspired and incommodious method. It never once felt natural. Beyond forced, it allowed Adrian to assimilate himself within the local community, but at what cost? The montage of anarchic chaos that plagued the streets of Saigon had no emotional impact because of this very reason. Too artificially created, just to appease both perspectives of the conflict.Then we come to my final criticism, the unwanted antagonist. Why oh why did they feel they had to have a villainous sergeant, I'll have no idea. But here we are. And there is one particularly ridiculous moment within the film that made me question the entire politics of the Armed Forces' inner workings. The sergeant sending two innocent colleagues through a Viet Cong-controlled route, just to rid of them because he didn't like Adrian's work ethic. Firstly, irresponsible use of power. Secondly, absurdly unbelievable! The plot didn't need an antagonistic archetype, the conflict within the office complemented the conflict within the country. That microcosm alone was enough to balance the drama with the comedy. Don't be sending characters into a death trap, just so the audience can acknowledge the intimidation of VC patrols (for a total of two minutes!). It's not worth it.Safe to say, despite the film not being bad in the slightest and harnessing one of Williams' best performances, I remained disappointed throughout. Various plot details envenomated the comedic moments and produced an unbalanced drama that infuriated more than entertained.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A very humorous but definitely real twist on Vietnam,7,11 April 2008,"GOOD MORNING, Vietnam!Those are the words that open up DJ Adrian Cronauer's (Robin Williams) broadcast to all soldiers in southern Vietnam during the war, the beginning of a time block filled with hilarity and setting a humorous tone to a very harsh war. That's what the premise of the film by that title is all about, and how Cronauer's non-traditional radio and rock 'n roll music choice caused a stir on the Vietnam airwaves.Barry Levinson's film is humorous, but it attempts also to be very serious in addressing censorship and the fact that so much of the war's actual events were kept undisclosed from the soldiers. The comedy is the most successful part, simply because Robin Williams is a fast-talking runaway train of humor. While the rest of the film isn't as effective, it certainly makes an effort. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" has a chance to take on more serious meaning, but it does so very casually and without true intent to be serious. After all, the genre listed is comedy, so that's what the film is.While some scenes, like the montage to ""What A Wonderful World,"" present a harsh irony and really show the war for what it was versus how it was perceived, those scenes get lost in the not as serious jumble of scenes and other scenes that are more serious but not nearly as effective. The conflict with Cronauer and those telling him he's wrong is probably the more effective of the drama compared to commentary on the war.""Good Morning"" is still a film that should be watched. It accurately shows a time and place in world history while not being a traditional take on it. You can enjoy the humor and see the war for what it was and that's a good feat for a movie.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

43,thinker1691,""" You're in more dire need of a BJ, than any white man in History """,8,1 October 2009,"The harrowing tour of Viet-Nam is a chapter in a man's life which is something he will not soon forget. Having survived it, one wonders why the U.S. military tried so hard to deny they were ever involved. Having been stationed there, we did as this movie so aptly portrays, listened to the Armed Forces radio while in the field. The film is called "" Good Morning Viet-Nam "" and is purported to be the story of Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) the Disc-jockey who was transferred from the isle of Create to serve in Viet-Nam. Once there, the exuberant and happy-go-lucky DJ, becomes the troops' favorite, boosting moral and actively seeking feminine company. It is this later activity which brings Cronauer into direct conflict with Sgt. Major Dickerson (the late, J. T. Walsh) a no-nonsense, strait lace serviceman with no sense of humor. Although the disc-jockey disrupts the military radio station playing rock and roll music and ad-libbing comical sketches of various political figures, which upsets Lt. Steven Haul (Bruno Kirby) it is his after-hours activities with Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana) his girlfriend and Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) her brother which produces sobering consequences and tragic results. Were it not for Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) his military patron, his stay would have been disastrous. Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl round out the fine cast and liven the radio setting. For Robin Williams, this movie is at the top of his impressive repertoire and is sure to become a Classic for his fans. Highly recommended as a collector's item. ****","Good Morning, Vietnam"
44,Coxer99,"Good Morning, Vietnam",8,15 April 1999,"Williams is superb as an over the top disc jockey who likes to rattle a few cages of his superiors, but also give hope to the countless men and women fighting in the Vietnam War. Williams' radio scenes are classic examples of off the wall antics at its best. Director Levinson just sits back and lets it all come alive.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
45,st-shot,"Williams sole energy source in ""feel good"" Nam film.",5,7 September 2011,"In Good Morning Viet Nam Robin Williams takes his stand up act to SEA as an irreverent DJ. A mild mawkish comedy under the mundane style of Barry Levinson who seems content to just turn the zany comic loose it never attains much of an energy level outside Williams inconsistent rants. Transferred from Greece to Nam to DJ and entertain the troops Adrien Cronauer has little respect for the men running the war and he subversively gets it across to the grunts on the ground fighting it who bond with him. His superiors find his attitude trying however and take steps, one very cynical and drastic, to remove him.In his prime Williams took his wacky and irreverent comedy routines and incorporated it into a ""Mr. Wonderful"" persona in a series of films in which he championed the underdog and vanquished the big bad establishment with his rapier wit. Good Morning may well be the best of the lot with an ideal occupation and situation for Williams to be in but director Levinson brings nothing in terms of a look or a cohesive storyline to the picture. Injecting flaccid montages to accompany the era's music he more or less abdicates his directorship in favor of Robbie coming up with comic gold. There's some dust to be mined but away from the mike Williams drowns in schmaltzy interplay with the child like Asians( courtesy of Levinson's hackneyed patronizing) bridging the gap like LBJ and MacNamara could only dream of. Good Morning Viet Nam is little more than a stage for Williams routine and incite, something you can catch on a late night show in less time and for less money.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
46,snoozejonc,Entertaining movie with a star turn from Robin Williams,8,14 April 2021,"A new DJ arrives in Saigon to entertain US troops over the airwaves.This is an enjoyable movie with a great central performance from Robin Williams, strong imagery and a great sixties soundtrack.The plot is based on some of the experiences of real life Vietnam DJ Adrian Cronauer, but as is well documented by Cronauer, the majority it is fictionalised for the entertainment value. Entertainment is something it does well, mainly because of Williams portrayal of Cronauer. Saying that, there is a pretty solid story that unfolds quite well, aside from a few plot points that feel rather contrived for the sake of drama and to portray certain characters are overly evil.There are several memorable scenes such as all Cronauer's scenes in the broadcast booth, his many antagonistic exchanges with the military commanders, his interacting with Vietnamese characters during English classes and probably the most memorable is one montage sequence that uses a well known Louis Armstrong song.I enjoyed the visuals. There are some great location shots from the streets and countryside of Thailand that double for Vietnam. Despite the con of being in a different country it all feels pretty authentic to the unknowing Western viewer.Good Morning Vietnam contains a number of very good performances such as Bruno Kirby, J T Walsh, Forrest Whitaker, Tung Thanh Tran and Noble Willingham. However, it is a huge vehicle for Williams, who throws all his energy, charisma, comic and dramatic timing at the audience in one powerful star turn. It feels in some scenes that they were just pointing the cameras at him and just seeing what happens. To be fair it rarely disappoints.As with all comedy, it is in the eye of the beholder so if Williams' improvisational humour is not to your taste, you are unlikely to enjoy the movie.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

48,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,A gut-busting comedy/drama/war flick,9,17 November 2005,"GOOD MORNING, Vietnam, in my opinion, is a gut-busting comedy/drama/war flick. I laughed really hard when Adrian (Robin Williams) did the traffic report (""How's the traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail?""), imitated famous people (such as Gomer Pyle), made fun of the weather (""It's hot! D*** hot!""), and all the funny stuff he did. It was really funny! The music was also good, especially the rock 'n' roll that Adrian played. However, I simply couldn't stand Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). This was because they seemed to have no sense of humor. In conclusion, to all you Robin Williams fans who have not seen this gut-busting, true story comedy/drama/war flick, I highly recommend it. I guarantee you you'll get a lot of laughs out of it.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
49,slokes,Madman At The Mike,6,23 August 2010,"At the center of ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is a man sitting at a radio microphone, performing a balancing act of uncommon delicacy as he teeters on the edge of madness and delivers the biggest laughs in the movie.That would be Bruno Kirby playing an obtusely square Army lieutenant who thinks he is actually a comedy cut-up. At one point in the film he gets his chance, after the much more successful DJ Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) has been pulled off the air for reading censored copy. Watching Kirby's Hauk character bug out when the other people at Armed Forces Radio Saigon beg him not to go on with his lame array of bizarre puns and French accents kills me every time I see this film.""If it's not funny, why did I hear you laughing when you typed it?"" Hauk demands of his aide.""I was thinking of something else.""""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is Williams' movie, of course, and most of the attention is on him. It's his best film for distilling the essence of Williams' comedy in cinematic form, basically giving him a mike and letting him rip. Williams' material isn't his sharpest, but it has the feeling of being off-the-cuff (probably was a lot of the time) and for the most part is very specific to the time and place of the film, Saigon in 1965.""Say, Mr. President, why did you name your daughter 'Lynda Byrd'?"" ""If I named her 'Lynda Dog' that would be too cruel.""The film does best when it sticks to the radio station, with Hauk whining about not being saluted while Cronauer develops his on-air persona to the approval of the U.S. troops, then still in build-up mode. The scenes with the other radio guys (including Forest Whitaker, Robert Wuhl, Floyd Vivino, and Richard Portnow as the affable but deadly-dull jock Dan ""The Man"" Levitan) have an energy and authenticity that sell the realistic comedy director Barry Levinson is after.But like too many 1980s films, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" suffers from an attempt to inject excitement and romance in crassly overt ways. So we have scenes where Cronauer woos a Vietnamese girl, befriends her brother, and tangles with the hard-case sergeant-major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh), whose homicidal hostility is neither developed nor well-explained. All this seems at the heart of the film's message, about the wrongness and destructiveness of war in general and this war in particular, yet the film doesn't need them.Proof of that comes in one scene where Cronauer, during a down moment, is pressed into delivering an impromptu stand-up for a bunch of troops about to ride into heavy battle. They laugh, and smile, and cheer, and in their nervous eyes and Williams' desperation to keep them entertained, you get about as strong an anti-war statement as you'd ever want to make.Too much of ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is burdened by the other stuff for me to recommend it too heartily. But if you're a Robin Williams fan - or even more, a Bruno Kirby fan - who hasn't seen this film, you really want to.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

Good Morning Vietnam could have been a great drama, instead it was a ""so so"" comedy with a Robin Williams audience. Since about only 40% of this movie is fictional it is hard to give this movie any credit for being historically correct. Robin Williams is funny as always, still the movie plays both sides of the fence, most of the time, leaning on the anti-war side. Without Robin Williams, you have a story which is suppose to be a comedy about the Vietnam war. Hard to do, and without taste, if I may add. A nice movie, but far from anything timeless or terrific. Forest Whitaker continues to find work as he co-stars next to Williams. Always in deep though with a twitch to his giant neck, you can't really tell if Whitaker knows that he is being filmed...","Good Morning, Vietnam"
52,rbverhoef,Admiration for Williams,5,11 November 2003,"The best thing in this movie are the songs the DJ gives us. That DJ is funny man Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) and we are talking 1965, Vietnam. I didn't find him very funny, but I can understand if you think that he is. Although I didn't like the character, a man who really was a DJ in the Vietnam war, I admired Robin Williams. With a lot of improvising, may be sometimes trying to hard, he does a great job. My problem is that I only liked some of the jokes and, again, there is a good chance you will not have that problem.The story is mainly about Cronauer. How his superiors try to get rid of him but his co-workers like him, especially Montesque Garlick (Forest Whitaker), how he becomes friends with local boy Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) and how he is in love with Tuan's sister Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana).It is all a little predictable. Example: Cronauer gets suspended and when they want him back he is not very willing. The sequence where he is convinced to go back, you will know which one I mean, is something that has to be in a movie like this. When you see the set-up you will predict the whole scene right.Again, I admired Robin Williams. The other performances are good as well. I loved the classic songs, I especially liked the sequence chosen during Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and of course the direction by Barry Levinson was pretty good. These things make this movie easy to watch, it doesn't get boring either, but I simply did not like it very much.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

55,KUAlum26,Effective movie that is neither too funny nor too grim,9,30 July 2006,"I just sat through a DVD of this movie,the second(?)time I'd seen this film. The last time I could recall seeing this,it was on pay-per-view television in a hotel(the Red Lion I think it was) room,August of 1988,so my memories of this film could use a refreshing. I'm glad I got refreshed.In 1965,Airman Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams,in the first of his four Academy Award nominations)is brought on to do an Armed Forces Radio stint in Vietnam. Behind the microphone,Cronauer lets loose,much to the surprise and delight of many of the troops and servicemen around the area of combat. His combination of off-the-wall humor,impressions,sound gags and quick wit,mixed with his love of free-wheeling Rock music of the era,is pretty much welcomed in the area,save for a few angry sorts: a Napoleon-complexed intermediate CO named Hauk(Bruno Kirby,unrecognizable but for the voice) and a stiff-lipped,quietly vindictive middle commander named Dickerson(J.T.Walsh,so good here it would seem like this typecast him). As this is going on,Cronauer becomes smitten with a local girl(Chinatra Sukapatra,spelling?)and befriends her brother(Tung Thanh Tran),which leads the popular DJ down a road of self-discovery.With excellent support from Forrest Whitaker(one of my favorites!he ends up sort of counter-balancing Williams' manic frenzy with nerdish normalcy as his buddy/assistant/guide),Richard Edson,Noble Winnigham,Robert Wuhl and Cu Ba Nguyen(as the oily GI bar proprietor)among others,this film,directed by Barry Levinson(whose work hasn't been this good in what feels like forever,certainly not since Avalon or Rain Man) and written by Mitch Markowitz,it is arguable one of the deftest films to create and maintain a balance between the horrors and inhumanity of war and the humor and pathos that are very much present in it. Robin Williams' fans may get much more out of this that those who aren't,but I think even many of those who don't consider themselves fanciers of his talents should be able to appreciate this. The images were powerful enough that they stuck with me some after the first time I saw GMV and after a second time I feel like can appreciate even more out of this movie.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
56,brchthethird,"A role tailor-made for Robin Williams, and a decent war movie to boot",7,13 November 2014,"""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is one of Robin Williams' best movies and was one of the first to really showcase his improvisational abilities. However, it's not just a comedy and in fact, the tone of the picture is more serious than you might think going in. While Robin Williams does get to let loose in several hilarious scenes as Air Force DJ Adrian Cronauer, there is an undercurrent of seriousness which seeks to examine the effect of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese citizens, as well as what the US troops endured. It's not particularly graphic, but it didn't really need to be. Up to the time this film was released there were several highly acclaimed films on the subject already. What sets this one apart is the character of Adrian Cronauer, who uses comedy to lighten the spirits of the men serving their country overseas. Still, the film isn't without its flaws. There is a romantic subplot that seemed shoehorned in just to give the film some extra conflict. Also, by virtue of coming later, none of the messages the film tries to get across were that original either. Still, it's worth seeing this movie for Robin Williams' performance alone. Forrest Whitaker also gives a good supporting turn as Cronauer's Army buddy/escort. Another outstanding part of this film was the soundtrack, full of great 1960's tunes. There is also a moving sequence set to Louis Armstong's ""What a Wonderful World."" On historical accuracy, apparently not all of the events in the film happened as described and some were surely invented for dramatic purposes. However, that doesn't really hurt the film too much. Is this Robin Williams' absolute best film? No, but considering what came immediately before, this collaboration with Barry Levinson (who he would team up with a couple more times in his career) was a step in the right direction. Just kick back, relax and take in the comic genius that was Robin Williams.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
57,gab-14712,Robin Williams At the Top of His Game!,8,17 May 2021,"""Goooooooooooooood Morning, Vietnammmmmmmm.""
When you hear Robin Williams and his manic energy bellow those lines for the very first time, you know you are in for a treat. This movie finally proved to the world how gifted of an actor Williams really was. Everyone knew about his comic skills and he proudly displays them here, but you see that his character goes through some bittersweet moments of self-discovery. Here, you realize that this comedian can nail the dramatic bits. Director Barry Levinson used William's comedian skills against him which allowed him to draw a stronger performance. If you were to grow tired of his schtick, you will be impressed with his dramatic portions. I have only seen him in Moscow on the Hudson prior to this film's 1987 release, and it is a more impressive performance-one that earned him his first of four Academy Award nominations.Williams's performance is based off the life of real Vietnam-era DJ, Adrian Cronauer. In 1979, Cronauer pitched his life experiences as a sitcom to the big studios. Despite M. A. S. H being a wild success at the time, they felt like war should not be used for comedy. Williams eventually got hold of the script and was impressed. Screenwriter Mitch Markowitz took over the script and almost completely changed the treatment. Essentially, more entertainment value was added. Some scenes that were never meant for an accurate portrayal such as the hilarious scene where Williams taught his English class how to swear and his pursuit of Vietnamese women did not happen in reality. But they did beef up the movie situations! Once Williams took the basic structure of Markowitz's script, it was off to the races. Levinson gave Williams leeway in terms of his improvisation. His radio monologues were generally hilarious.Following the recent successes of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, we get another Vietnam War film. The tone is a touch lighter (thanks to the immediate presence of Robin Williams) but manages to pull some dramatic strings. The audience responded with positive reviews and made this film the fourth-highest grossing film domestically in 1987. Of the two films Levinson directed in 1987 (with Richard Dreyfuss's Tin Men being the other one), this is the better of the two. In addition to the lead actor, it has a great supporting cast. Levinson did a good job on setting an even tone of comedy/drama. Of course, the soundtrack is excellent. Cronauer has some excellent taste in rock'n'roll. (with apologies to the Percy Faith-loving CO).Without much background on the man, we are immediately introduced to Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) who is shipped from Crete to Vietnam to deliver comedy for the Armed Forces Radio. With his nonstop rapid delivery and a more modern music taste, he becomes an instant hit with the troops. Management, especially the immediate CO Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh) do not approve of his antics. He becomes good friends with one of the soldiers, Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) and he tries to woo the Vietnamese ladies. In addition, he teaches English to the local Vietnamese and he also experiences war action, something that would humble even a comedic DJ celebrity.I can make this entire review talking about how amazing Robin Williams is, but I really did enjoy the supporting cast in which Levinson was able to humanize. The best part about the cast is how Williams's peers, especially his commanding officers, react to his nonsense. I was in stitches. Bruno Kirby is excellent and unrecognizable (with the exception of his voice). J. T. Walsh was likewise great. And Forest Whitaker had excellent chemistry with Williams. Keep an eye out for solid character actors like Richard Portnow and Robert Wuhl.Overall, Good Morning, Vietnam is another film that tackles the war in an era with plenty of them, but it comes at it with a unique angle. Robin Williams is the film's star, and his improvisation is just a reason to watch his performance. But he also undertakes an important journey of self-discovery where he learns it is just not about the jokes. There are some moments of hilarious craziness, and moments of intensity. The film goes a little long in the tooth at times and not all of Williams's jokes work for me. But those are small complaints. If you want to see Robin Williams at the top of his game, here you go!My Grade: B+","Good Morning, Vietnam"
58,SmileysWorld,A great morale booster!,8,15 March 2002,"Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as ""Sergeant Major Dickerson"",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
59,bellino-angelo2014,The movie that made Robin Williams a star,8,17 January 2019,"GOOD MORNING VIETNAM may not be my favourite movie with Robin Williams, but I still enjoyed it very much. And even though it's based on a true story, the movie made a good balancing of comedy moments and dramatic moments.Williams plays Adrian Cronauer (1938 - 2018), a DJ that had the task of entertain the fighting troops during the Vietnam war with his radio show, where he was also ostracized for his irriverence and funny delivery, but in the meanwhile he also socializes with some Saigon citizens and he is also supported and reassured by Pvt. Edward Garlick (played by Forest Whitaker). Sadly Cronauer doesn't obtain his show again but he will be remembered in the hearts and memory of all the men that loved his radio show.This movie's strong points are: Robin Williams' marvellous performance (at his zany best) and he more than all dominates the movie. Also Forest Whitaker and Noble Willingham (more remembered for his role in WALKER TEXAS RANGER) give nice supporting performances. Also the soundtrack is good, with ''I feel good'' by James Brown and ''California Sun'' by the Ramones, how can you go wrong? And Barry Levinson directs nicely.And, this was the first movie for which Robin Williams was nominated for an Academy Award, and he should have won for this performance, but he lost it to Michael Douglas in WALL STREET. However this movie is very worth-watching and easy to please everyone. Do not miss it!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
60,Atreyu_II,"Goooooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!",7,2 January 2010,"I've been trying to watch this movie for ages without any success. I heard that Robin Williams makes wonders in this film. Finally I managed to watch this movie, now that the new year has arrived.The movie itself is okay, although in many ways better than I expected. But indeed Robin Williams is pure genius in this one! This is one of his very best performances, along with 'Dead Poets Society', 'Hook', 'Aladdin', 'A.I.' and 'Popeye'.Set in Saigon during the Vietnam War, this is also a war movie. It's not entirely comedy. Robin Williams also does a great job in drama here, but it's his comedy skills that really make him shine. This is Robin Williams at his best! Robin portrays Adrian Cronauer, a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio Service who greatly amuses the troops serving in South Vietnam but angers his superiors with his irreverence (they don't have any sense of humor, really - or they're envious of him). But, unlike Robin's character, the real Adrian wasn't that funny.Robin is hysterical whenever he is on the air: he makes voices (typically Robin), he mixes unusual humor with news updates... and I loved it whenever he starts his show by yelling «Gooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!», as well as whenever he pretends to be a teacher.Robin also puts nice music in this film, such as Beach Boys, James Brown's ""I Feel Good"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"". There are some errors of dates, though. The movie takes place in 1965 and the song ""What a Wonderful World"" came out in 1967. But that detail is not to be taken very seriously.Trinh, the Thai girl, is quite pretty. Whoever is the actress who portrayed this character, she did a good job.Overall, a reasonable film without being great. It is particularly worthy for Robin Williams's genial humor which takes this movie far. Robin was so fun in this movie.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

In the movie, the new DJ is in fact encouraged by his fellow enlisted soldiers to play contemporary pop music from Motown and The Beach Boys and engage in rapid-fire comedy patter. Various military people all laugh at the new DJ's verbal antics, but as might be expected, the military higher-ups are not pleased with the new DJ's irreverent program.A good potential idea, but poorly utilized. Robin Williams' routine was reportedly ad-libbed, but his comedy routine failed to be funny. The soldiers are all shown laughing, but one gets the idea that they do so because that is what they were hired to do. Rapid-fire comedy and silly verbal antics can be hilarious, but Williams was simply dull and boring, as if he wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. I didn't bother to finish the film; what I saw of it shouted that it was going to be standard and clichéd, and what good is it to watch a comedian who is not funny?I wonder what the real-life DJ was like. He certainly must have been funnier.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
68,Movie-12,Robin Williams does his thing well in this comedy that makes us think. ***1/2 (out of four),8,14 November 2000,"GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM / (1987) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:	Robin Williams is about as good as they come at doing stand up comedy, and in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" director Berry Levinson gives him everything he needs to make the film go above and beyond the average satire. From his outgoing sense of humor, to his aggressive personality, and dozens of vocal effects, he portrays his character with interactive zest. Who can resist the awakening voice of Williams on the radio yelling ""Good Morning Vietnam."" This is a film that conquers the test of time.	""Good Morning, Vietnam"" tells the story of a lively disc jockey who gets a job on Armed Forced Radio during the Vietnam War. Robin Williams is the fast-talking Adrian Cronauer, and who better to play the part than he. Although this character is one-dimensional (we are never informed on his background, marital status, where he comes from, what he did before we meet), as the movie continues he gradually begins to change into a deeper, more meaningful person.	The story moves along smoothly; the narrative through-line is consistent as each scene relates to the next. Although little momentum or suspense can be noticed, the film does have several underlining themes, often viewed upon in a Stanley Kubrick style: sarcastic and uncompromising. We see how much a little humor and jazz can greatly enlighten the hard-core atmosphere of the military during Vietnam, and how it can thoroughly confuse the bleeding heart officials. 	The film hangs by the skin of its teeth for active conflict tension. Beyond people objecting to the actions of Williams' character, there is just not a lot of tension within the story, and at some points my interest wandered. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is merely a portrait of Robin Williams releasing his perennial comedy, and unfortunately that does happen to get old quite quickly; the majority of an audience can only watch the humor for so long until it becomes old and somewhat stale.	""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is definitely not a flawless film, but we do empathize for the main character, the scenes effectively capture the attitude and mood during the war, and the dialogue and writing feel accurate and involving. Barry Levinson has directed a marvelous comedy, one that is not all about making us laugh, but also makes us think.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

70,RossRivero99,Williams is brilliant,10,20 October 2014,"Barry Levinson's Good Morning, Vietnam is arguably his best film work since Rain Man (1988). The movie tells the story of Adrian Cronauer (played by Robin Williams) a wisecracking disc jockey in which some of his superiors really dislike his humor especially 2nd Lieutenant Steven Hauk (played by Bruno Kirby), but however most of his fellow officers do completely enjoy his humor (including me while watching this film). One thing that completely surprised me was the fact that this movie was inspired by a true story, as well as the fact that Williams ad-libbed those lines that the real life Adrian Cronauer mentioned during his time as an Sir force disc jockey. During the course of the film Williams meets a Vietnamese girl that he has a huge crush on and then follows her to her school and wants to teach the class that she is in.The movie also has a great supporting cast which includes Forest Whitaker as one of Cronauer's friend Edward a man he meets during his assignment,Noble Willingham as his commanding General,and as well as the two characters I hate and love at the same time Bruno Kirby as Steven Hauk a Colonel who is very full of himself, and J.T. Walsh as Sergent Major Dickerson a soldier who really hates Cronauer the most out of all the characters in the movie. The ending to this movie really touched me because how the Vietnamese girl who he had a crush on as well as her being one of his temporary students really didn't want him to leave the country, I would have felt the same way too if I was in the same platoon as Cronauer was in real life.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
71,LebowskiT1000,Excellent blend of comedy and drama!,8,26 December 2002,"Robin Williams' role in this film is probably his best known to date, as it should be.  This is a great film!  I suppose this falls in the category of comedy, but there is also a great deal of drama in the film as well.  The film has some interesting things to say about war, politics, racism, friendship, the military and a few other things (or at least that's what I got out of it).  Of course, the comedy greatly outweighs the drama in the film and is absolutely great all the way through the film.  If you are a fan of Robin Williams' comedy, be sure to check this film out.  The cast in this film is very good.  Robin Williams is, of course, just fantastic in the film.  He's a little nutty sometimes, but that is to be expected and that's what the role called for.  Forest Whitaker is very good in his role and plays a very likeable character.  Bruno Kirby, on the other hand, plays a very UN-likeable character, but did a fantastic job with the role.  The rest of the supporting cast was very good as well: JT Walsh, Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham, etc...  Director, Barry Levinson, did a very good job with this film as usual.  If you are a fan of Robin Williams or any of the cast/crew, then you should definitely check out this film.  If you like war-comedy films, then you should take a look at this film.  I feel that the film is most definitely worth seeing, so do yourself a favor and go see it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris","Good Morning, Vietnam"

By the way the performance of Robin is absolutely amazing, you can tell this is a perfect role for him and Forest Whitaker was great and smart. Maybe it's a bit hard to understand those jokes or maybe the character just spoke to fast that you can barely understand what he's saying but I really enjoyed it.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

In general I don't really think Robin Williams is as funny as everyone else does and talking fast/switching thoughts really fast doesn't really do it for me. That was the same here although there are some good lines for sure which is the same in all his for me, he's not bad just not my favorite comedian. I probably would have rated it worse but it turns into a good drama like halfway through the movie. I found that aspect far more compelling. Still, I liked it and was satisfied with the movie for sure. The guy was just there to make the war more bearable and that's what he did.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
74,nickenchuggets,I ain't no fortunate one,7,2 August 2021,"Recently, I've been watching a great deal of things relating to the war in vietnam, most of them consisting of actual footage that was recorded there during the fighting. This movie is not a war movie in the traditional sense and has a prominent element of comedy thrown in, but it's important to remember that it does take place in vietnam during the 60s. While I thought it was good, I don't know if I would consider it one of Robin Williams' best. The story opens with Adrian Cronauer (Williams) being sent to Saigon, south vietnam's capital city. He isn't there to fight, but instead is assigned to hosting a radio station to boost the morale of american soldiers. A soldier named Ed who works at the base is assigned to be Adrian's partner. However, his boss, Second Lieutenant Hauk and his subordinate, Sergeant Major Dickerson, do not approve of Cronauer's radio antics. They accuse him of encouraging negative behavior, saying his personality is too energetic and wild. Because of this, Cronauer is constantly at odds with them and struggles to keep his job. Lieutenant Hauk's boss, General Taylor, is a fan of Cronauer's radio station though, and overrules the lieutenant's wish to get Cronauer suspended. Later, Adrian, goes to a vietnamese schoolhouse and takes over the lessons there, teaching the students in the class to use american slang and profanity. While there, he meets a girl named Trinh and her brother Tuan. After bringing Tuan with him to a GI's only bar, two marines get into a fight with Adrian, which leads to him getting scolded by his superior officer. After going back to the bar and then leaving one day, it explodes violently and some people are killed. Adrian notices that Tuan somehow managed to escape the blast. Intent on letting this important news reach american ears, Adrian locks himself in the broadcasting room one day and starts spilling the details. An enraged Dickerson pounds on the door and disconnects the machine. Not only this, but Adrian is fired. This immensely pleases Dickerson and lieutenant Hauks, allowing the latter to replace Adrian as the radio host. However, no american servicemen like the new host and he receives a flood of hate mail. Meanwhile, Adrian tries to win Trinh's love, but she keeps turning him down. General Taylor overrides Hauk's decision to serve as radio host, and Adrian is reinstated. Despite this, he doesn't want his job anymore. Some time later, Adrian comes across a bunch of soldiers ready to be sent out on trucks, and one of them convinces him to ad-lib one of his broadcasts. Reluctantly, he does so, and the applause he gets from the men convinces him to get back to his work. Upon seeing Adrian back on the job, sergeant Dickerson is infuriated. He phones some marines in the field to find out if a certain road that Adrian is likely to travel on is unsafe, and they say yes. Dickerson sends Adrian and his friend on a car ride through this area, and their jeep explodes from a land mine. Adrian and Ed survive the explosion and begin making their way back to safety when Tuan suddenly appears and leads them to a rescue helicopter. Back at base, Dickerson bullies Adrian relentlessly for his behavior, calling him a moron. More importantly, Adrian learns he has lost his job permanently because Tuan is revealed to be a vietcong agent. He was the same one responsible for bombing the bar earlier, and was able to slip out before it exploded. Dickerson and general Taylor tell Adrian that sadly, they're not able to save his job because coming to the defense of a spy would be hypocritical for the United States. Adrian pressures Trinh into showing him where her brother is, and he tells Adrian he hates americans because they're responsible for bombing his village. At the end, Adrian says goodbye to Trinh, gives Ed an audio cassette containing his last broadcast, and leaves on a plane back to New York. Dickerson also starts complaining about how general Taylor has transferred him to Guam. I have to say, I typically don't regard many movies made in the 80s as classic, because the ""classic"" era of cinema was gone for some 2 decades by that point, but overall, this movie's ok. It is incredibly funny in certain parts, such as when Williams is tasked with broadcasting a speech by President Nixon and he edits his voice to answer out of context questions, such as whether or not the US Army has a marijuana problem. It's also pretty impressive how most of the snappy and very fast radio talk Williams does in this movie was improvised, and he managed to say all of it without making a mistake. On top of this, I also liked the setting of the movie itself. Saigon is not a place we often get to see in film, and here, it is portrayed as a dirty, rundown, dangerous hell on earth where there's way more people than houses and attacks by north vietnamese can come at any moment. The resemblance to reality is stunning. In all, I thought Good Morning Vietnam was a good addition to the list of well made vietnam war movies, even if it does have a macabre subject for a so called comedy.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
75,DavidSim240183,A perfect showcase for Robin Williams' unique improv,9,25 October 2007,"Good Morning, Vietnam is undoubtedly the film that propelled Robin Williams to the A-list. Beforehand he was only known as Mork from Ork, and the films he'd been asked to appear in (except perhaps Moscow on the Hudson) were ones not really giving him an opportunity to flex his true muscles as an actor.But GMV changed all that, because it was the first time Williams had been given a character that finally allowed him to showcase his unique brand of improv. In this case, a DJ.Its what Williams does with the part that makes GMV so compelling. His live-wire performance transforms the entire movie. Without Williams, GMV would be a considerably lesser film than it is.Barry Levinson's film is rather unique because it was the first (and only) one to add a bit of comedy into the Vietnam War. Taking a leaf out of MASH's book, it uses the conflict in Saigon as a backdrop for William's barnstorming impressions and impersonations. And for the most part, its a sweet package.Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a funny man shipped to Saigon to be the new host of a morning radio show. Adrian's irreverent antics in front of the mike raises a few eyebrows among the straight-arrow US military, but the troops love him!All the while, Adrian gets to know Vietnamese culture up close and personal. Something that leads to romance, friendship and eventually a betrayal that changes Adrian's life forever.It was the decision to put Robin Williams at the centre that makes Good Morning, Vietnam such a great movie. Williams is a master of improvisation. He can slip from one impersonation to the next effortlessly. And the best part is, none of it is scripted. Williams improvises routines right out of thin air. You know he's just making this up as he's going along, and its a remarkable thing to see.Levinson knows Williams needs no script or cue cards to work from. All he does is position the camera in front of Williams behind the mike, give him the line Good Morning, Vietnam and then go from there. And its like watching a comic whirlwind. Any scene with him on his radio show provides non-stop laughs. He has seldom been better in anything else.What I also liked about GMV is its humorous approach to the misguided Vietnam conflict. Its when it tries to be a little more serious and dramatic that the film falls down. Yes the war in Vietnam was a terrible tragedy. Especially because it represented the American's sabre-rattling mentality at its narrowest. But the dramatic elements offer nothing particularly enlightening about the war. The comedy elements however do.When Good Morning, Vietnam is funny its very funny. But when it tries to make serious points it slows the film right down. Its Williams irreverent commentaries on the conflict that give the film its life. Even when he's doing impressions of Richard Nixon and even Elmer Fudd there's a thinly disguised veil of contempt against the US military's participation in the Vietnam War. They're wrapped up in sharply satirical comic material, but they make more of an impact than the film's outright heavy-handed approach. Subtlety makes all the difference.Robin Williams is the heart and soul of the entire picture of course. Whether he's delivering manic rapid-fire monologues on the air to teaching native Vietnamese the hip aspects of the English language, he holds the attention whenever he's around. He was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. An Oscar he should have won really.Levinson surrounds Williams with talented character actors. The most engaging are Forest Whitaker and Noble Willingham. Whitaker plays Edward, a timid young man who learns to loosen up after spending time in Adrian's company. And Willingham plays Gen. Taylor, the only one among the top brass who takes a shine to Adrian's unorthodox methods. He brings depth to what could have been an easily clichéd character.On the downside, JT Walsh plays exactly the type of character Willingham is so skillful at avoiding. A pompous, self-important bureaucrat who takes an instant dislike to Adrian's free-thinking spirit. I have to admit I found it a bit hard to swallow that Walsh's character Sgt Major Dickerson (tee-hee!) would actually try to get Adrian killed in VC territory. No matter how much he hated him. His is an unnecessary character really. The film could have done just as well, and arguably better without him.Nethertheless, the ending is still quite sad when Adrian winds up being shipped back to the US because one of his Vietnamese friends is a terrorist. Williams performance is so faultless that even when you can see the mechanicals of the plot clicking into place, you still feel sadness for him. His closing message is the perfect blend of cutting humour and acute pathos.Good Morning, Vietnam would have been better if it had stayed true to the comic route. But despite a few bumps in the screenplay, Robin Williams' quite excellent (even virtuoso) performance keeps things remarkably on course. He made a questionable detour into sentimental schmaltz in the following 90s, but this film shows you what Robin Williams can be capable of when given the right material to work with.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

But not really. Because when JT Walsh tried to have Williams killed it didn't feel right. I don't think anyone would do that. And then the last half kinda struggles to find some relevance or arch and fails.It was a good watch and funny with good acting but it's not really about anything and feels like it should be.I don't know why my dad put this on when I was a kid and my mom was gone for the weekend.

Taking a comedic look at the US' presence in Vietnam, Good Morning, Vietnam portrays a character Williams is well versed in, wise-cracking and confrontational to authority and wrong doing. The film dips into the severity of the context but only really scratches the surface, showing some depth and contrast within the storyline without pushing too far. The real drama is short and although light hearted and fun, it never is never particularly gripping.

84,jb_campo,Robin Williams Rocks the Airwaves!,8,20 September 2015,"Robin Williams stars as Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force Dee-jay who has been brought to Vietnam to be on the airwaves there, ostensibly because he was funny when he was a Dee-jay in Crete. There is a real Adrian Cronauer, and this story is based on him, but the marketers never advertise this as based on a true story, so you know this must be mostly Hollywood at work.Cronauer's style is unique, wild, wacky, crazy, with tons of voice impressions and just off-the-wall stories and personalities streaming out of the head of Williams/Cronhauer into the ears of the troops. It's a huge departure from the typically monotone, boring, and heavily censored radio entertainment, and the troops love it!Forrest Whitaker also stars as Ed Garlick, a fellow radio Dee-jay and kind of the mentor to Cronauer. Once Cronauer gets settled, the story centers around two themes: 1\ his battle against the uptight stations owners, played beautifully by J.T. Walsh (See Breakdown - great bad guy) as the Sgt Major and Bruno Kirby as Lt. Haulk who desperately wants to be funny, and believes he is, but no, he's just not. And 2\ his attraction to a young Vietnamese woman he sees passing on the street, Trinh (played by Chintara Sukapatana who went on to become an actress with some credits). Cronauer develops a friendship with Trinh's brother Tranh, and Cronauer slowly realizes that the cultural division between him and Tranh is wide and probably insurmountable. Barry Levinson directs this masterpiece, with excellent taut movement from scene to scene - not much wasted moments here. See Rainman and The Natural from some of his other gems.In the end, what happens is pretty much what you might expect, but it doesn't make it less heartfelt an emotional pull for the viewer. I wouldn't describe this as an anti-war film, but more so, as a film that encourages you to question the status quo as you go through life, which is certainly what Cronauer did, in spades. Enjoy this fine film!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
85,Darkjak007,Gooood Morning Vietnam TCM Essential,7,10 May 2021,"Directed by Barry Levinson Good morning Vietnam loosely based on the story of Adrian Cronauer starting Robin Williams as the new host of the AFRS station to provide news and morale to the troops of Vietnam he sees how the Lieutenant and Sergeant Major runs this station as a big joke, does his best to make the most out of his time here goofing around and having a good time he eventually ends up becoming the most popular man in Vietnam. The higher-ups see him as a problem and a minor nuisance until Adrian witness the impact of the war firsthand and spending time with the people realized There's more going on here then he thought. While the movie is a comedy it still has a powerful tone to it. Similar to Full metal jacket there's a anti-war message ideas of censorship and what you're doing is actually right. Robin character Adrian make a compelling lead. He just thinks it's all a big joke until he spends more time with the locals and actually connects to them on a deeper level. Some of the most heartwarming scenes are when he's with the locals. He grows as a person but doesn't lose his self. Forest Whitaker as Eddie Garlick is good supporting role and good for a laugh he plays more of a dorky private. But the film doesn't forget the setting there are several time when robins joke on the radio and footage of shooting and ex's poles it a good example of a glided situation it looks nice on the surface but underneath it's dark and gritty.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
86,lib-4,Disc jockey bucks the system.,7,15 June 2000,"Robin Williams is excellent as the disc jockey Adrian Cronauer  who dares to defy the powers that be in Vietnam. He knew the average age of the soldier was 19 so he played what they liked. He also treated the nationals like human beings.  The most poignant scene was as he played Louis Armstrong singing 'Its a wonderful world"" the screen was showing just the opposite- poverty, death and war.  This movie makes a strong statement about the power of words on people- Adrian believed in starting the day with a laugh- his supervisors did not. He did more for morale than anyone else.  For those who watch Vietnam movies this is a must.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
87,Mike-DD,Comically Serious,10,17 August 2000,"One of Robin William's best films then and now. Though the movie is set during the Vietnam war, that does not tone down the comedy that Williams brings to it. Through it all, his character Cronauer manages to lift the spirits of the men at a time when everyone there thought no one's spirits could be lifted. His irreverent takes at anything from the weather to the war itself is simply hilarious and is Williams at his comical best. A definite must-see for anyone who seen the other serious war films and need one which shows you the lighter side of it.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

I was moved from this movie at the time I saw it even I do not know why I have missed to write about it till now.So... Goood mor-ning Vi-et_naaam! It is really interesting to see what happened to this country and how a single person using the radio and radio broadcasting - these such powerful sources of the mass communication - succeed in uprising the spirit of the people doing what he like most. I do not know why but on the last accent from the previous sentence his role of disco jockey, in a way, is best presenting the man and how he feels about his passion.Naturally, it is clear the deep sense of ""who is paying, he is playing the music"" and - you will dance what we play looked in a political way for which the movie can take a lot of critic.When I watched the movie for the very first time I have not the experience that I have now.

89,Hawkensian,"A dull, predictable film that's merely a vehicle for Williams's tediously overbearing comedy.",4,23 August 2014,"There's a great Family Guy cutaway gag in which Peter Griffin and Robin Williams sit on a sofa as Peter names topics such as religion and politics for Williams to comment on. Williams does so with his trademark brand of insufferable overbearing comedy, which is filling any amount of time with frenetically incessant rambling. Peter responds simply with an exasperated sigh before leaving for a five minute break, which prompts Williams to start yet another barrage of supposedly funny noises. I felt much like Peter Griffin whilst watching Good Morning Vietnam. It reaffirmed my opinion that Williams was not the 'tragicomic genius' that so many purported him to be.Read a short synopsis of Vietnam and you'll know exactly what it's all about: the lovable family favourite Robin Williams being kooky, charming the troops but clashing with straight-laced, humourless authority figures. It's completely predictable and completely trite. They also throw in a love interest for good measure in the form of Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a wholly lifeless woman whom Williams refuses to stop pestering.Williams is never funny during his radio broadcasts, however the film repeatedly tells us otherwise, showing us scores of characters struggling to hold back their tears of laughter. So many of the supporting actors, whether they're random troops or studio operators, were just diegetic canned laughter rather than proper characters.Make no mistake, Robin Williams isn't playing Adrian Cronauer, he's playing Robin Williams at his most loud and rambling. Williams is repeatedly characterised as the lovable clown who brings the people together, it's rather nauseating; no matter how hard the film tries, it cannot convince me that he's either funny or charming, only very irritating. Despite this, there are some moments that raised a smile, such as the language class scenes in which he focuses on New York City street talk rather than the artificial, staid sentences of the textbooks.Williams's flatly developed adversaries Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickinson (J.T. Walsh) are the typical officious military men, they develop a resentment towards him that's so instantaneous that it's contrived and unbelievable; they're just narrative functions that try and make you feel sorry for Williams the lovable crazy cookie. Both characters aggressively impose their superior ranks on Williams and the other men, reminding me of the great Machiavelli quote – 'It is not titles that make men illustrious, but men who make titles illustrious.' Quite frankly, the quote is wasted on a trivial little film like this.It sometimes attempts to be a drama or 'dramedy' with moments of perfunctory war moralising, but ultimately Good Morning, Vietnam is preoccupied with indulging Williams's penchant for shouting incessantly rather than achieving anything approaching credible commentary or pathos. 45%www.hawkensian.com","Good Morning, Vietnam"

91,AbhiMathews,Make life a little brighter,7,22 February 2015,"War brings out the worst in mankind. But in the midst of chaos, look for the helpers.Adrian Cronauer is this type of person. With no real good or bad side, it's hard to decipher strangers' true colours. Regardless of warfare, Mr. Cronauer simply tries to remind people of their humanity. To remind them of better times. To remind them of the laughs and joy any person can share with another.Truly understanding both sides is the greatest battle. Bringing to light the truth that is too often silenced and progressing together instead of dominating is a solution rarely sought. Remember that war is seldom fought by the ones who actually started it. To stop it is imperative. To endure it is even harder. Nonetheless, Adrian Cronauer tries.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Cronauer speak and his comment on the movie was, ""If I did half of what was portrayed, I'd still be in Leavenworth.""

93,AmyJenson1995,I truly miss you Robin,8,12 May 2017,"About 3 years ago, a true comic gem decided to leave us far earlier than we expected. He made us laughing so much we never imagine that behind that love for life, there was a much darker hidden side which ultimately took him from us. That man was Robin Williams.One of the characters he'll be always remembered for is without a doubt the radio host he incarnated in Good Morning Vietnam. This role was made for him as he could show his tremendous comic and acting talent. The fact that the scenes when he's hosting his radio show are all improvised is speaking volumes of the huge sense of imagination and comedy Robin has displayed throughout his career. But he can also show that he could be a very dramatic actor as well. The scene when he comes back to the radio station after witnessing the bar bombing is truly heartbreaking especially when you see him all alone completely down while the rest of the world keeps going on and the machines are getting frenzy.But it would be unfair to not cheer the rest of the cast who is supporting Robin so greatly especially Forrest Whittaker as Private Garlick, Tung Than Tran as Tuan, Bruno Kirby as Lt Hauk and J.T. Walsh as Sgt Major Dickerson.The latter is particularly distasteful as this very rigid Sergeant who is managing the radio station in Saigon. He's the true antagonist of the movie as he sees Adrian Cronauer as an uncontrollable burden and he's trying to get rid of him with any means necessary including sending Adrian on an assignment in an area controlled by the Viet-Cong.The late Bruno Kirby is bringing a second source of comic relief as this goofy lieutenant who is acting as Adrian direct supervisor boasting about his own comic genius which is in fact truly dreadful. There are some very memorable scenes he's a part of which are truly funny though.What I also like in this movie is they are not showing the Vietnamese people as the bad guys. They are displayed as a poor and rejected people with a true sense of friendship and humor willing to share the beauties of their culture to the Americans. The last scene when they are sharing a baseball game with Adrian before he goes back to Washington is truly moving.All of this is making this movie a gem and Robin Williams is bringing it among the stars. God bless your soul Robin.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
94,tml_pohlak_13,A very good morning indeed!,10,31 May 2009,"The interesting thing about ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is that so little of the horrors of the Vietnam War are shown, that the film effectively portrays the horror and senselessness of war. Director Barry Levinson instead shows shots of a printing machine showing the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. The numbers constantly rise. It's very effective.Essentially, though, ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is a hilarious comedy starring the master of improvisation, Robin Williams. Williams plays a non-conformist radio DJ, who essentially tries making the troops laugh. The GIs love him, but the military's top brass (especially Sgt. Major Dickerson, played by J.T. Walsh) is up in arms.Interesting enough, by the end of ""Good Morning Vietnam"", we learn so much more about the characters— except Adrian Cronauer (Williams). He uses his comedy as a wall, keeping people from learning about him. When stranded in the wilderness, he starts using one-liners on the trees, for instance. This is a guy who remains a secret because he wants to— and it works, developing his character better than any back-story could.Another extremely effective touch in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is the music. Sometimes, I'm not a fan of music with lyrics in films (most often, instrumental music works best, in my humble opinion). But in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", songs about love are being played to accompany a time of war. It's a successful move.The acting of the film is exemplary, including a touching performance by an actor you probably never heard of, Tung Thanh Tran. Memorable performances come from Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and J.T. Walsh, and Williams even got an Oscar nomination for his performance.To conclude, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is an interesting (to say the least) mix between wartime drama and comedy, aside from being plain old hilarious.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

96,Mobithailand,"It is funny, entertaining, sad and thought- provoking in equal measures.",9,4 May 2016,"'Good Morning Vietnam', starring the late American comedian and movie mega-star, Robin Williams, is probably the most telling and memorable anti-war film made about the Vietnam war.I have mixed feelings about Williams as a comedian – I suppose I struggle a little with him in much the same way as Americans struggle with many British comics. He was undoubtedly a very gifted, genuinely funny man and when I succeeded in following his very fast repartee, I can laugh along with the best of them. But sometimes, his delivery is fast, and so 'American' that I just can't follow what he is saying, so most of his clever humour goes over my head. I do remember once watching him being interviewed on UK's Michael Parkinson chat show, some years ago and he was utterly hilarious and took the whole show over with his brilliant antics and 'one liners'. Maybe he slowed down his delivery a bit for us slow-witted Brits. He is also no slouch as a movie actor and has a string of successful hits to his name. I was never a great fan of Mrs. Doubtfire but I thought his performance in Dead Poets Society was truly inspirational.I like Williams a lot in Good Morning Vietnam and his wacky, spontaneous sense of humour was absolutely perfect for the role of the irreverent, entertaining DJ who was shipped over to Saigon to shake things up at the armed services radio station. The movie is based on the true experiences of a DJ who was sent there during the early days of the war, and he states that the story is about 40% accurate – but which 40%? Of course, we will never know. I still had problems with Williams' rapid-fire delivery and 'one-liners', when he was broadcasting 'on air' and sometimes I was lucky if I caught one joke in five of his deliveries. But that didn't matter, as he was in character and was playing the part of this crazy, funny DJ and I have no doubt that the GI's had no problems in understanding what he was saying.Interestingly, like The Deer Hunter, the entire Vietnam sequences (which are prevalent throughout the movie) were all shot in Thailand. I had not realized this until I read the closing credits, although I should have known something was amiss - the traffic was all driving on the left-hand side, whereas in Vietnam they drive on the right. The Deer Hunter did not really deal with the Vietnam war as such, but merely used the war as a background to show the effects the war had on a group of blue-collar workers from America's hinterland. 'Good Morning Vietnam' on the other hand, was clearly an anti-war, anti-military bullshit-bureaucracy, where tin-pot, ignorant, myopic officers abused the power they had over their fellow soldiers. We can make some allowances for a certain degree of dramatic licence in the interest of a good story. But even so, the background to the movie was totally believable and certainly provided an interesting insight into how seeds were being sown, which would eventually lead to America's greatest military disaster. When the Williams character arrived in Saigon in 1965, the conflict in Vietnam was regarded as a local little skirmish, but by the time he was thrown out of the country, it had already developed into a full-scale war, even though news of the daily bombings in Saigon by Viet Cong terrorists and the general war escalation was kept from the local radio airwaves.Ironically, along with many other milestones, the Vietnam War eventually became the first war where the world could watch the 'action' from the front lines as they ate their dinner at home every night. It was the first time that unimpeded access was granted to journalists and TV crews.'Good Morning Vietnam' is funny, entertaining, sad and thought- provoking in equal measures. Enough time has now passed for the viewer to resist the urge to become too judgmental about the 'villains' of the piece' – the US military; but nevertheless, it remains an interesting film which helps us to understand why America's 'Dunkirk' will probably remain part of their psyche for many years to come. If you haven't yet seen it, I recommend you give it a go.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
97,Jetset971,Great Movie! Back when Robin Williams' movies were funny.,8,14 May 2010,"I recently saw this movie again after seeing it over and over again in the late 1980's. It remains as intriguing, funny and thought provoking as it did way back then. The only thing that upsets me watching this movie is the painful reminder how just how much Robin Williams' films have tanked in the last two decades. I hate to say it but the fact is that Robin Williams sold out a long, long time ago. Sure he had a major breakthrough with ""Good Will Hunting"" back in 1997, but that was a Drama. All his supposed ""Comedies"" have gotten less funny and more stag-net as time has gone by. There are far too many to list but the major stinkaroo titles would be ""Fathers day"", ""Patch Adams"" and that bottom feeder of a comedy ""RV"". Take more time to look over these scripts your getting Mr. Williams. Think Carefully!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
98,bedazzle,interpretation,6,5 June 2001,"Interpretation, spoilers: Two main struggles are woven together throughout this movie: the struggle between censorship and free speech and that regarding our role in Vietnam.
The struggle with censorship ends in compromise. During his visit with the troops, Robin realizes that the happiness and morale of the troops is more important than voicing every bit of controversial news. Humorous satire and sarcasm are one thing, and even lighten the burden of the soldiers, but reading unofficial news of the sort he did was completely unnecessary. There is no point in scaring the soldiers by telling them of bombings in demilitarized when nothing can be done to alleviate the problem and only learned helplessness will result. But, the censored news could have saved Robin a lot of trouble at another point. Basically, in this conflict between oppressor and oppressee, rebellion for the sake of rebellion is pointless and counteractive - as demonstrated by the final address and every post-suspension show. Concerning the war itself a liberal position is taken. The human side of the Vietcong is shown, though secretly at first, and Robin shows his compassion for the enemy by risking his life in order to tell him of his death warrant. In order to make the liberal ideal come out less preachy, the young rebel himself proclaims it. Also, this leftistness is kept in check with Robin's chastisement over the bombings. Their intentions are well and good, but their actions are not.  Perhaps it seems out of place to speak of these aspects of the movie in a comedy; I think they definitively outshadowed the comedic aspects. Though I was able to catch most of the war references, much of the musical references and era references were beyond me. So maybe my age was a factor, but it would have to be damn funny to overshadow the dramatic issues posed by the war. Overall, 6 of 10, somewhat entertaining from a educational perspective.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

They look at the conflict, without getting in too deep.A superb cast as well including Bruno Kirby and the late great J.T.

102,jb-448,Vietnam Funny?,9,28 August 2008,"I never thought that a film on the Vietnam conflict could be funny but here it is, drink it up. Of course, now you've got more comedy war films these days (Tropic Thunder Anyone?) but I think this would be one of the first comedy based war films. Robin Williams outdoes himself here in a very innocent honest performance, hilarious and very human at the same time. His basic mindset is to brighten up the lives of some soldiers in a very grim, disturbing situation but anal politically correct superiors (the late great Bruno Kirby) hold him down. I honesty contemplate the weirdness of this. Blood and gore is outside all over the bloody place while some people are trying to sensor a morale boosting DJ!? Strange but true.Along with being one of the first war comedies it's gotta be one of the first movies to show the Vietnamese as actual humans. They live, breathe and die while some biased movies try to vilify everyone single one of them as blood lusting monsters. It's a nice change but this movie falls behind some movies (Apocolypse Now, Platoon) and beats others (Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill) just for the simple fact that this was funnier while not losing any seriousness in the process. 9/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"

This movie isn't a comedy by any means but it has humour in spades to make one enjoy it and face the reality of what happened in Vietnam. It is amazing how humour does ease the pain and formidable hurdles one has to overcome in life (and especially in war)This is surely one of the best Robin Williams' movies and probably one of the best showcases of his personal life: bringing joy and laughter to those around him, not showing that he had to face his (inner) demons like everyone else around him... His talent is obvious in this one, and I miss him...A 10 out of 10 movie that everyone should watch.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
104,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,Who knew Vietnam was this much fun?,8,3 August 2000,"This movie is Robin Williams at the top of his game in comedy. Robin was huge back in the eighties when he was doing his brand of hyperactive, hyper-referencing schtick in his stand-up act, but it doesn't seem to make the transition to film all that well, except in a few cases (this is one, another would be Disney's Aladin). The problem with other movies is they let Robin do his thing where it really has no place in the story. In this case, it IS the story so it works quite well.I like Robin when he does good movies, like this one for example. I can just imagine all the G.I.'s getting stoned and listening to him on the radio (""This dude is so funny! Hey, is someone shooting at us?""). There are a lot of laugh out loud funny moments in this flick. His act wears thin a few times, but over all it's great stuff. Bruno Kirby provides a lot of laughs too as the anti-Robin of the radio.Director Levinson has had an incredible career. Seems he's always doing something interesting, it's refreshing to watch a guy at work where box office isn't a concern, he just puts them out and you like them or you don't. This one starts out with big laughs, tells a sweet story about Robin's character and his relationship with the locals, and ends on a more serious note actually dealing with with the war and its effect on average citizens. Not Apocalypse Now or Platoon serious, but it's well done for a comedy. Worth seeing if you haven't already. 8/10 stars. G'night!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
105,wolverinesforever,An insightful and intelligent view on the early days of Vietnam also acts as the perfect Robin Williams vehicle,9,27 July 2010,"A big hit when it came out in 1987, ""Good Morning Vietnam"" follows the five month stay of Adrian Cronauer (Williams), a wildly enigmatic radio dj who's brought to Vietnam to start the 6:00 time slot in the morning. What the Army gets is far more than what they expected. Cronauer mocks everything about Vietnam and the world, making up headlines, imitating soldiers, and inserting plenty of blunt and fast humor. While the soldiers on duty appreciate this, his higher lieutenants are displeased by his outlandishness.The film works twofold. The first, and most obvious attribute, is the humor. Robin Williams is truly on a roll here, making up and firing jokes as fast as he can. I had to turn on closed captioning so I could understand them all, but once I did, I appreciated his humor far more. It also helped that I knew some history from the time period, so I could understand more of the jokes. You'll want to have an appreciation for his kind of humor here; Barry Levinson lets his radio broadcasts (and, at one point, his sudden one man show for numerous truckloads of soldiers) go on for quite some time.The second, and not so obvious attribute, is that this movie is also a very smart insight into the early days of the Vietnam war. We see news headlines printed about how the number of soldiers being sent to Vietnam are increasingly rapidly. Terrorist bombings start occurring in Saigon, traumatizing Adrian to the point of where he can't do his broadcasts. The Vietnamese are also portrayed very well here, with some shown as being appreciative of the American presence, some as skeptical, and some more with both feelings.And just as Robin Williams is shown as a funnyman, he is also shown as a more down-to-earth person. It's interesting to watch the progression of his character, as we learn more and more that he uses humor as a wall of sorts to block him from the bitter truths of life. Though he never admits it, we know it saddens him that the people who are listening to his show are doomed to a worsening conflict. There is a bitter irony when he hear his final broadcast and he says ""I've got the lottery ticket out of here!"" This really is the perfect Robin Williams vehicle, because we get to see him both as a comedian and as a ""regular guy"" (although, admittedly, it's kind of hard for him to be a ""regular guy"" when he's so famous among the fellow soldiers). And the screenplay is smart too. The comedy makes it watchable, and the historical and political insight makes it memorable.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
106,CosmicDwellings,Williams the Big Movie Star!,8,11 March 2001,"""Gooood Mooorrnning, Vieeetnamm!!!"" screams Robin Williams from the big screen as he stakes a claim once and for all to be recognised as a long awaited Big Movie Star-an actor in his own right. This achievement is made with the aid of a well-scripted storyline, supporting cast and fine direction, with of course that certain special 'Williams-thing' that was his bread and butter even at this time of things-stand up/sit down improvisational comedy in front of a microphone. This all makes for a truly rare, wonderful and unusual scenario unlike any film of this genre. It's a touchy subject but it's all handled beautifully, making it a touching subject more than anything which can be very few and far between in any routine comedy/drama.Robin Williams has come a long way since his TV days of 'Nah-nu, nah-nu' as he sets out to portray that he can handle the heavy and demanding scenes as well as anything else. But, he had already gone through the motions of these kind of scenes previously with the likes of the classic 'World According To Garp','Moscow On The Hudson' and the maudlin 'Seize the Day'.
In this film the 'Williams-machine' all came together for the very first time as he portrays his version of Adrian Cronauer, the Armed Forces Radio D.J. sent out to Saigon in 1965 to help whip everyone's morale into shape-and that he certainly did! Well, maybe not everyone's has one or two of the top ranks aren't too pleased with such quips as ""the Big Dick is here!..."" when referring to a visit from Vice-President, Richard Nixon.When you see Williams,as Cronauer, perform the comedy routines on, and off, the Airwaves, all you can do is watch in hilarious wonderment and ask just exactly what kind of brain are we witnessing here.'Good Morning, Vietnam' is billed as a Comedy/Drama, but it was the Drama aspect of it that for me, certainly shone through as much as the hilarity side of the script. All the aspects that centred around this angle of the Vietnam War-Cronauer in trouble with his superiors, falling in love, and ultimately crossing the political line of fire, all make for a creative piece of film-making, and certainly one that deserved it's Oscar nominations. Mr.Williams seems to have a flair for making this type of comedy with a mix of the unusual dramatics, and this seems to have started with the aforementioned 'Garp' and is continued after 'Vietnam' with the lesser-rated, but rather amicable 'Cadillac Man' and the absorbing 'Fisher King'.Anyway, no matter what, you will laugh, cry and laugh again at 'Good Morning, Vietnam'-it is a classic. And, don't forget all those great sixties tunes in the background.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

108,aristofanis,Robin Williams tries to save the day...,7,17 July 2006,"Robin Williams turns this mediocre story into a one man show. Still, the laughs yielded here are far less than if there hadn't been such an emphasis on how funny he is... Laughter cannot come out forcefully. The anti-war messages in this movie aren't enough to deviate from a sublime American propaganda. When Robin Williams demands censorship-free news like back home he gets ""this is not America"" as an answer. It is implied by both that such things never happen in the States. Not to mention that the information censored was never about doubting the war but facts that would possibly hamper the army's moral. When the Vietnamese boy expresses the agony of his people, the ""anti-war"" DJ exclaims ""we are only here to help""! Any sentimental attachment Williams had with the locals seems to be in the realm of joke. Even his little affair with the young girl doesn't seem to overshadow him a bit. At the same time he is very convincing when saluting the U.S. soldiers. He also feels pity for the pick-up bar ran by a perversive underworld local.... Excessive coarse jokes also spoil some possibilities for humor. Silence is funnier sometimes. 6/10","Good Morning, Vietnam"

What started as a dull, boring night was to transform. The movie was not just going on, it was taking me with it, it was capturing my smiles in a 12 mega pixel camera. All courtesy Robin Williams. He is the head of the film, and he is the leg too. He played the character perfectly, blending emotion and laughter in right proportions to create a believable performance. Forest Whitaker, is good as the side kick, with his expressions being right all the time. But what stands out about this film is that this film succeeds in not being partial to America, nor is it partial to Vietnam.

111,ablebravo,"Great, yet not so great",6,20 August 2009,"Let me say first that I own the DVD so that says a lot about the film. I don't buy movies indiscriminately just because I recognize the title. This is a fine piece of entertainment and Robin Williams was probably never better in his role' as Adrian Croenaur. The casting is uniformly excellent with kudos going to the sadly departed Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk and J.K. Walsh as Sgt. Maj. Dickerson.I've worked for many years in radio and the one issue which grates on me personally was how incredibly sloppily the actual scenes of Williams were handled while he was doing his broadcasts. I suppose Barry Levinson didn't think that it would matter to accurately depict a radio control room (or hoped no one would notice - but I did). Like: at no point in the film were the level meters indicating the sounds heard on the soundtrack. Yeah, they were moving, but not in synch with the sounds supposedly playing through the control board! There was one scene with a clear close-up of a tape recorder which was NOT running, yet the meters were merrily bouncing as if it was playing. Come ON, Barry!All that said, I am willing and able to look past that to see a great film with a great script and a great story. Do I recommend it? Sure!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
112,dixiedoggg,So when do we start the laughter?,1,15 May 2021,"Not Robin Williams worst film, that would be 'Mrs. Doubtfire', definitly not his best.Let me say the filming was terrific, the editing suburb, the cast topnotch, and the music was good if only they played a whole song or two.Williams work in other films is sometimes brilliant, sometimes spot on, but this mess as a DJ in Vietnam probably would have been great if not for his constant way over the top attempt to be funny. The other actors in this film must have been paid top salary to appear to enjoy the manic ad libs from Robin's mind.Honestly, if you removed Williams from the cast, it would be a good movie. Trying so hard for laughs is not funny and never will be.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

Only on the way the executives handled the situation. I was left utterly exasperated after having seen this.The only likable character in the entire movie was the Vietnamese boy who turned out to be a member of the Vietcong. If I would be facing such ignorance I would be tempted to do the same. For I definitely had a deep desire to punch all the other characters in the face, especially on the American side.This movie is an insult and shows perfectly well the haughtiness America is criticised for in the rest of the world.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

Boy was I wrong! This is some awesome Robin Williams material. Many times I actually found myself laughing out loud.

117,robert-turner-1,The Thinking Person's War Movie,10,7 March 2005,"It's 1965, and maverick DJ, Adrian Cronauer, is despatched to South Vietnam to breath life into a moribund forces radio station.Against a backdrop of mounting political violence, Cronauer, uses humour, honesty and compassion to win the hearts and minds of soldier and civilian alike.But, his unorthodox approach to life lands him in hot water with the authorities, and inevitably leads to his downfall.""Good Morning Vietnam"" was the archetypal feel good movie of the 1980s. Robin Williams is given free rein to express his considerable talents, delivering a master class in comic improvisation. A performance which he has sadly failed to better since.The screenplay and soundtrack is drenched in period detail, complemented by some crisp photography which brings into sharp focus a city hovering on the brink of civil war.For my money ""Good Morning Vietnam"" must surely figure as one of the most intelligent and well balanced movies to emerge from Hollywood. Nothing comes closer.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
118,lachlan-mcdougall,Robin Williams as The Perpetual Pierrot,7,15 May 2014,"A fast-talking, wise-cracking, unorthodox radio DJ (Robin Williams) is sent to Vietnam in the days leading up to war. Here he learns life lessons, shares witticisms, mingles with the locals, and experiences the horrors that war in all its forms wreaks upon the world. An engaging premise for a film, and one which in the case is handled with great skill and care.I think, however, the thing that sets this aside from the multitude of other Vietnam war films or any other films that use humour to throw brutality into sharp relief is that this really is not a story about war. No, it is a film about a comedian's place in the world.Williams plays the perpetual Pierrot: laughed at and joking so that he feels like a real life human being. When our protagonist steps off the plane into the sweltering powder-keg of sixties Vietnam he is closed to the viewer. His japes and jokes are merely a way to justify his own useless existence. He breaks the rules of military radio not to prove a point, but to win the acceptance of his irritated comrades at arms.But, the death of friends and the turmoil of terrorism open him up to us for the frail and hollow man that he is, but this hollowness is what makes him such a complex and rich character. His stillness and sadness pierces to the very core of what is is to be a joker in the face of world of trouble, and it is not a pretty sight. He is now justified by a sense of purpose and the sense that others might rely on him rather than the shallow acknowledgment of one's own existence given by others, and this is where the real tensions take place.This deconstruction of the comedian and this insight into the defences we put up to ward of a savage reality is, in my opinion, what makes this one of the finest Robin Williams films to have been made. We, the audience, laugh not merely because Williams' patter amuses us, but because like him we would rather not subject ourselves to the ugly truth.Aside from soul-searching, however, this film has the added bonus of being beautifully constructed. The sixties soundtrack is woven expertly in through brilliantly shot panoramas and vistas, the editing is seamless and engaging, and no actor leaves room for doubt in the story. Forest Whitaker in particular is notable for his subtle performance of the nervous boy who grows into a confidant man, and Noble Willingham's gentle General is a nice touch in smoothing over the rough bumps of military complexity that might have otherwise arisen from this story.Really, my only issue with this film is, try as I might, I can't ever seem to find as much humour as is intended in William's quick-fire rambles. I mean, there is the occasional gem of shining wit (""women in comfortable shoes"" gave me a good chuckle), but mostly his quirky voices and manic ranting slide right past my funny-bone without giving it the slightest twinge. This gripe, however, pales in comparison to the purpose that his comedy serves. As I said before, he doesn't need to be funny he just needs to make the jokes so we don't pay attention to what's happening all around us.So, in conclusion I've got to say that Good Morning Vietnam is a very good film indeed. It lets the viewer float through without much demand, but on a slightly closer inspection it reveals a wealth of intentionally glossed over depth.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
119,ionov,A must-see.,10,23 March 2000,"One thing about this movie is that it is probably one of the best movies of the 80-s.Another true fact is that Barry Levinson, Robin Williams and late J.T. Walsh will be remembered in 40 years time primarily because they made GMV!.It IS very funny (do not be tempted to watch in any other language but original!) yet is a very serious film - definitely not Arnold and Dolf type. It brings to attention just another side if Nam war but not only. A delicate but nonetheless impressive show of characters under the strain of another ""...for the sake of the nation..."" crusade.No Vietnam theme is complete without GMV and it certainly deserves buying a DVD player just to have this single movie in collection - because you'll play it over and over again.It is not enough to put together light, film, camera and a few actors to make a movie. It takes talent, luck and some magic to make real ones. These guys had all three of it.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
120,joan6350,Robin Williams at his best!,10,16 February 2014,Robin Williams is at his best in this movie which has to b e the perfect movie for him to do. He won an Oscar eventually for the worked he did on Good Will Hunting as a best supporting actor but I didn't like that movie so I pretend he got the award for his acting in this movie instead. I think this is his best acting and also his best over all movie (maybe this shared with Dead Poets Society). He plays an army radio DJ who goes to Vietnam to entertain the troops because he is so fun and well liked. His show ends up being a hit but he rubs all his superiors the wrong way by making fun of them and Richard Nixon and doing funny characters on the air as well as breaking all kinds of rules.I won't spoil the ending but if you haven't seen this check it out because it's a very funny movie but also can be very touching.,"Good Morning, Vietnam"

It is a drama and a love story full of emotions and you will laugh and cry and be amazed by Mr. Williams performance all at he same time. This is no doubt his best movie ever, even if I'll admit that the Dead Poets Society comes pretty close. On top of including all of the above features, Good Morning Vietnam is also based on a true story and in my opinion very realistic. And that is what makes it so unique. First, find a movie that features the fun, the emotions, the tragedy, the characters, the setup, the story and the atmosphere of this brilliant peace of film-making. Then find one that is believable. You will only find Good Morning Vietnam. The best film I have ever seen. Go watch it and see for yourself.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

This was no more clear than in the classic scene where the visual images of the war was the backdrop for Louis Armstrong's beautifully touching song ""What a wonderful World"".

125,RiggsAbbott,"A Robin Williams Classic, With a Few Flaws",7,3 June 2019,"Many may criticize Williams' overbearing, abrasive, and often frenetic comedic style. But this movie has you covered in lt. Hauck. He acts as an amazing foil to Williams' character as well as serving as a vehicle for people turned off by Williams'. But even with Williams' comedy being very subjective, it fits the movie very well. The idea is that he is brightening Vietnam soldiers days with his radio show. In some cases his bright and optimistic demeanor is one of the only shining parts of the battlefield, the movie makes this very clear.Williams' character has a very interesting arch albeit fairly predictable. Rather than having us follow from the view of Williams I often found myself following the side characters reactions. I found Hauck's complete distaste for Williams' humor contrasting everyone else's opinion quite funny. And the relationship between Williams and Garlick allows to see how Williams changes throughout the story.There are a few issues that I have with this movie however. This movie gave me tonal whiplash. For the majority of the beginning I felt like it was going to be a lighthearted comedy with a little romance mixed in. Then when the bar exploded it took a much more serious tone and if it had continued for the rest of the movie it could have been better. But as it is, Williams struggles to deal with the incident for a while and it shows him in a terrible emotional state. Then it cuts to Hauck making terrible jokes on Williams radio show for comedic effect, regaining a more lighthearted tone again. It continues with Hauck until Williams is going to get show back. Williams declines which makes sense for his character. The brief argument scene between Garlick and Williams is well done as well as his live performance for the soldiers. (I would also like to add that the ""What a Wonderful World"" scene juxtaposed perfectly with the war scenes in the background. I though this was a good tone for the movie) I didn't like that Hauck and the Sergeant General came up with some dastardly plan to dispose of Williams as it came out of nowhere and didn't make much sense to me.Overall Good Morning Vietnam is a decent movie I would give it a watch even if Williams' style of comedy isn't your favorite. It held my interest for the most part and ends in a satisfactory manner. Even though I spoiled quite a bit of this movie I hope you all enjoy it.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
126,rcy_filmtex,Second best Vietnam War movie.,10,12 November 2006,"Just watched ""GOOD MORNING, Vietnam"" today, Veterans Day, and I have chosen this as my second favorite Vietnam War movie right behind ""PLATOON."" As a Conservative, I have to give the Liberals credit, they do know how to make entertaining films which capture the beauty and the horror of men's experiences in war. My third favorite, of course in honor of John Wayne, is ""THE GREEN BERETS."" Not in the class of GM,V or Platoon, but a good entertaining western set in Vietnam.Robin Williams should have been given the Oscar for his performance as Airman Adrian Cronauer even if the experiences of Cronauer were a bit fictionalized. Probably a best supporting award for Forest Whitaker would also have been in order.As with Platoon, Good Morning, Vietnam has that look and feel and smell of Vietnam and the war. Possibly you have to have been there to smell it in a movie, but a Vietnam Vet will know what I am talking about.This film has a note of sadness to it from another angle. Three great character actors who gave realistic and credible performances are no longer with us. Noble Willingham, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh. They each played characters who were very much like men who were in Vietnam. Some good, Willingham as the General; some confused, Kirby as the 2nd. Lt.; and J. T. Walsh as Sgt. Maj. Dickerson. Oh for real, there were a bunch of Sgt. Maj. Dickersons in Vietnam.This is a 10 for me.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

128,Rico45-1,Institutional dependence,9,20 September 2009,"This is a rather old film on the Vietnam War. It has aged. The denunciation of the censorship that existed in the US forces in Vietnam, is still efficient, but it deals with the past. The Vietnam War is finished. The humor about the ex-Vice-Président Nixon, is of course a lot less efficient today, because a lot of time has gone by. The vision of the war is still very mild, though it emphasizes, still, the fact that the Viet Congs were everywhere, and it states in a very few sentences the real motivations of these young people who joined the fight against the Americans : personal, victims all around them, and the fact that they were at home, and the Americans were not. But the film has taken, since its first release, a completely new meaning, more allegoric but also tremendously strong. This time it has do only with the functioning of an institution, no matter which, that has to respect some norms coming from above and not from its audience, its public. It has to do with censorship and the desire and tendency of some people to refuse it in the name of the good old freedom of expression and of the press. Just this point, repeated quite many times, shows how strong such a functioning is. But the film delves into the human relations that come along with this general functioning. Those who detain authority in this institution feel frustrated by those who rebel against the censorship they try to impose. And it reveals that the former will try to do anything they can do get rid of the troublemaker : they will send him on an impossible and death-ridden mission, hoping he will be killed ; then they will build up a file trying to show that he is a traitor and has to be courtmartialed, and then they will condescendently move him out of the way with a nice speech on generosity, clemency and even compassion. This denunciation of this terroristic functioning of any institution, public or private, is still valid and full of relevance. On that level the film has not aged one single iota.

129,Phaeron,Vietnam Simulator 1987,8,17 August 2018,"This movie had the very same effect on me the Vietnamese civil war had on Vietnam. Asking for a more satisfying end but realising the ending I have is not quite that bad.
 The entire movie, despite not showing brutal war scenes for an hour, perfectly conveyed me what a war is. It is about losing those who are dearest to you, the people you do a radio show in this case, for the silliest of reasons, human ignorance and envy.

130,loffler4,"""The horror.""",2,9 April 2000,"This film is but a reminder of how brilliantly funny Robin Williams once was. As a military dj, he is allowed to riff at will.  Unfortunately, comedy's greatest daredevil is now working with a net.  His improvisations are no longer improvisations; rather, they are simulations, a stock set of comic moves performed at break-neck speed (so as to give the impression of spontaneity). And Levinson's heavy-handed direction only makes matters worse. There are so many cut aways to listeners laughing their poor heads off  that you can't help but feeling bullied (""YOU don't tell ME what's funny. I tell YOU what's funny."").

132,leilaculic,The one and only Robin Williams,9,31 August 2020,As many of you have heard off this movie or watched this movie so most of the stuff is already written here. But I can only say that Robin Williams was the type of actor that was able to act from comedy to drama and in each movie he would give the best of him. He had that ability to adapt to each role and he would act like it was his last.Unfortunately he left us too early. God bless his soul. But he was among the best actors in Hollywood. Only few people had that ability to adapt to each role without any fuss and play it like a natural thing.,"Good Morning, Vietnam"
133,AidanKnightly,"Starts weird and cult-y, turns dark and more emotional than I ever wanted",7,15 December 2014,"This is my first review that I'm going to write seriously so be gentle. I am known as the the guy who will try to like everything and thank the lord, this movie is one of them. I saw the cast and the ""pop culture"" quotes such as ""You are more desperate need of a blow-job than any white man in America"" and figured it would be a good watch. It starts of sort of...boring? I guess is the best way to put it. Robin Williams, god rest his soul, was talking too fast as usual and nothing really stuck. Things really started to stick when he met Tuan, a young Vietmanese fellow who he would endure much with. Much of the story involves this boy, and I won't spoil everything but the movie really struck a cord with me when Williams character was saved by Tuan when Jimmy Wah's bar was bombed. Seeing Wah absolutely crushed, confused, and angry was a startling change from the happy, go-lucky Jimmy we've seen. The undertones of racism and America's true influence on the Vietmanese moral really hit too. It became incredibly powerful, and more than I bargained for, but still retaining the humour RW always promises in his movies. Forest Whitaker was a delight, being the meek, by the book US army guy, turned into a man who really grew into his role of doing things the morally right way as opposed to regulation. I find this movie misses a bit on plot in the first half which is the only reason I'm giving it a 7. If the start really ripped into the true horror Of Vietnam, like what was demonstrated when ""Oh What A Wonderful Life"" wailed in the background while we were subjected to violence and horror in the foreground. More of those types of moments early on would have helped set the underlying and foreshadowing, but the shift from RW slapstick to ""Oh shoot I'm really in deep now"" was truly remarkableI'm the guy who will try to like everything and this is one of those movies that I do like.Thank you for your time and stay tuned for more reviews from this somewhat cranky and meta-cognitive guy.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

135,user-643-804365,Adrian Cronauer goes to Vietnam as a DJ to help boost morale of American Soldiers,9,26 March 2013,"In the movie, Adrian explores Vietnam. visits a local English school, bars and markets to fully immerse himself in the Vietnamese lifestyle. During his travels, he made several friends and he eventually got to know a man called Tuan incredibly well. Tuan taught him many local Vietnamese traditions and even introduced him to his sister. As Adrian continued to interact with the local Vietnamese people, he started to enjoy his lifestyle. Unfortunately, the sergeant and lieutenant were constantly at his back and demanded that he change the content of his broadcasts, as they weren't appropriate for the soldiers. This and the fact that the military censored so many things really made Adrian upset. In his opinion, he strongly believes the soldiers have the right to know everything, something that the higher ups do not support. As he continued to broadcast in that manner, he was eventually suspended for a period of time but he was later brought back due to the soldier's demand. Towards the end of the segment, Adrian discovers Tuan's true identity, a terrorist wanted by the South Vietnamese police. This results in the loss of a close friend and his job and after five months of working in Vietnam, he departs the country. This movie really portrays life in Vietnam. It doesn't focus on the battlefield but more on the way that American soldiers and civilians alike adapted to the Vietnamese lifestyle. In one of the bar scenes, Americans are shown to be racist to the South Vietnamese, in the bar, which is similar to the way white Americans used to treat African Americans. An American soldier insults Tuan and Adrian takes offense to the treatment that his close friend is receiving and it results in a fight between him and the soldier. In Vietnam, Adrian also spent lots of time in Vietnamese cinemas and astonishingly, films had English subtitles, showing how great American influence is. Streets in Vietnam are filled with Americans doing their thing and it seems like they're back in America. In the school scene, a soldier taught simple English to the Vietnamese, just like a normal class back in the states. This is an example of pacification in Vietnam. Instead of young kids being taught English, the class consisted of Vietnamese people ranged from teens to the elderly, showing that America is willing to educate the Vietnamese about American Culture. In the story, it is evident that many Vietnamese blame America for the havoc and damage done to the country. Terrorists bombed the bar where Americans wen to and protests were staged against the presence of Americans. The protests became so violent that even the police had to get involved. They discretely killed the traitors/terrorists that threatened the lives of Americans and when it was revealed that Tuan was one of theses traitors, he explain to Adrian, ""Enemy? What is an enemy? You killing my own people so many miles from your home. We're not the enemy. You're the enemy. Big deal! My mother's dead. And my older brother, he's dead. Shot by Americans. My neighbor, dead. His wife, dead. Why? Because we're not human to them. We're only little Vietnamese."" That scene when Tuan angrily spat out those words to Adrian strongly signified the hatred that the Vietnamese had towards the Americans. Tuan and Adrian were close friends but his hatred of Americans overcame their friendship and eventually, Tuan was caught as a traitor. Lastly, the movie heavily portrays the influence of media and soldier's morale. Over the span of the Vietnam War, many soldiers were homesick, missed their families and on top of that, they had to deal with the many hardships of war such as losing their close friends and comrades. Having to experience such pain affected their morale and many soldiers just wanted to get out of Vietnam. As a DJ, Adrian helped to boost the morale and when he visited the soldiers in the battlefield, his jokes and humor helped to provide happiness and made them feel appreciated, like they had something to live for. Boosting morale was one of the major factors in helping with the war. Unfortunately, soldiers were often never given the whole truth about information. For example, news headlines such as ""US military leaders in Saigon urge secretary of Defense, McNamara to approve a force level of 350,000 to 400,000 US soldiers"" were censored and nobody knew what it truly said. The higher ups such as the second lieutenant and the generals never told the whole truth, as they didn't want to lower the morale of the troops by talking about the harsh realities of the war. Adrian disagreed with such methods and even though he expressed his disapproval of it, there was nothing he could to change it. In the end, Adrian was able to take away with him friendships with many of the soldiers and local Vietnamese and he was able t truly experience Vietnamese life. This comedy film is entertaining and it is different from many other Vietnam War films as it shows life in South Vietnam, not on the battlefield but how Americans merged with the Vietnamese society.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
136,DeepT,One of the mose memorable films I have seen,9,27 November 1998,"I have watched more than a few movies in my time but this one still stands out as one of the best.Robin Williams stars in one of his best roles as a Radio DJ amidst the horror of Vietnam.  A wise-cracking star of humour and moral to the soldiers of Vietnam while higher officials around him build a dislike toward him through his satirical approach to the politics surrounding the war.  Through his sense of loyalty to his work and to the soldiers of Vietnam he bucks authority and tries to make a difference.As I said, this is one of the most magical and memorable films I have seen. I wouldn't describe this film, however, as a comedy.  The film is indeed very funny and I still find it impossible not to laugh through the radio broadcasts.  But I also found the tone of the film sets itself apart from the comedy and describes the Vietnam war in a very serious and moving way.It is very rare that I would rate a film as highly as I do this.  Anyone who watches movies should see this - rent it, buy it, borrow it, steal it.  This is a piece of art which deserves to be seen.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

It is important to recognize that the film addresses the tragedy behind the highly sensitive and tragic Vietnam War, and the film is masterful at touching ones heart with drama.  One of the more memorable and notable scenes is when Adrian Cronauer entertains the American soldiers who were leaving for battle while in their transport vehicles; one could grasp the feeling that these young individuals were being sent into certain death.  I felt that it was simply brilliant.  This film demonstrates the most difficult task of intertwining comedy and drama with such a perfect balance.

Robin Williams is so hilarious in this film and is said to have been hand picked by Adrian Cronauer himself. One of my favorite quotes is, ""What is with this 'Police Action'? Sounds like a couple of cops in New York saying, 'Hey, she looks good to me' "". If you are looking for a war movie,though, this is not for you. The film focuses more on Adrien Cronauer, and less on the war itself. It gives underlying truths concerning cultural differences, rank differences, and censorship. Plus, it's just downright funny! If you have not seen this film, then go immediately to a place of video rental or purchase and buy it, or rent it, and watch it!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
142,midwaymike,Excellent movie,10,16 October 2006,"You must know the era and the prevailing facts to judge this film. It is my humble opinion that this is a grade A film. Combine the acting and the truth and you can only come to one conclusion- an excellent film! The acting and the overall performance of every actor involved { what a cast ! }is deserved of recognition. I would recommend this film to every person under the age of 35 , just to show the sacrifices which the American soldiers of every era since the Revolution to these hard times in Iraq, have endured . DO Not Hate The Soldier, he only takes orders!!!As in all wars, the lowest ranked soldiers, catch the most shizzit.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
143,pips-lodge,A brilliant multi-dimensional film.,9,14 September 2006,"This film has a superb mix of contrasts, Robin Williams at his insane best but against a backdrop of a very serious story and how Uncle Sam's interference how ever well intentioned just creates a mess. Given that the Vietnam war was 40 years ago and this review is being written some 40 years later (nearly 20 years after the film was made) it is interesting to see parallels with what has followed in American actions since and also in what is going on today.Some wonderful 60 music adds a real highlight to the film, against some the intense interactions of Williams and the other characters.The humour is top class, and even if you are not a Williams fan I doubt you could fail to appreciate it. It just frame & highlights some powerful messages.In my book this is a top notch film that can be enjoyed thru countless re-runs.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
144,BryanDevos83,CAPTIVATING AND INNOVATIVE !!!,8,17 September 2020,"In the first place, Good Morning, Vietnam is a serious film about the war and deals with serious problems such as morale and the dangerousness of the conflict, it follows the arrival of Adrian Cronauer played by Robin Williams, a radio host, in Saigon in 1965. Assigned to the local radio of the American armed forces, he disembarks from Crete at the request of General Taylor, interpreted by Noble Willingham. His mission is to boost the morale of the troops present on the territory. This 2:01 movie was released in 1988 at a time when you had to be careful of the way you talked about the war. Indeed, the Vietnam war had been over for only a little over a decade and the ""Cold War"" was still a reality.This film is great especially thanks to the talent and genius of Robin Williams who feels inspired and who improvises to perfection. From Cronauer's first speech you feel at ease and it is funny because you are so absorbed by his speech rate. We see in this film that the character of Williams is quickly tired of the censorship imposed by his superiors, he thinks differently from his colleagues who let this censorship pass without complaining. The plot also forms around his love affair with a Vietnamese woman as well as a change of atmosphere when Cronauer is sent to the jungle, the plot forms around the fact that he is not a soldierThe moment that turns the film upside down is when a Vietnamese village is bombed, while you can hear music that opposes sound to action which caused me a feeling of sadness. It is after this that Williams will try to convey all the information that is not disclosed to his listeners while keeping his humor and his entertainment. There are still moments of hesitation, when the film goes from a funny moment to a serious one. Despite that Good Morning, Vietnam remains a very interesting film, with very good music that offers us a different approach to the Vietnam war. I find that even though it was released in 1988 this film is very original, excellent and unique, it's become unmissable.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
145,cbwilson-3,A wonderful conmemoration of the hardships of Vietnam soldiers,10,23 October 2006,"This movie made me cry and laugh throughout! What soldiers in Vietnam faced was no picnic, and the man (such as the one the Robin Williams portrayed) who used his amazing facility of humor to brighten the lives of millions of young soldiers performed an act of altruism that ought to be remembered and admired. Robin Williams's character embodied what it meant to be American during Vietnam: stubbornly proud, a fighter, and an optimist even when all hope is lost. It is amazing how bringing a smile to someone's face can help them to carry on and in the case of a soldier, to not be so afraid and to try to forget about the possibility of death with every turn. Williams deserves so much praise for his perfectly timed shrewdness and witty humor and the life he ultimately brings to his character and to the entire picture.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
146,emh3058,ehenderson1230@franklin.edu,5,11 June 2011,"This movie depicted the era of the Vietnam War, and presented Robin Williams as Adrian Cronauer. As a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Service he brought a breath of fresh air and comedy to a very dismal situation. He had quite an impact upon the morale of the enlisted men, but was disliked intensely by Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk played by Bruno Kirby and Sergeant Major Dickerson played by J.T. Walsh. They felt he was severely irreverent. Many films have been made concerning Vietnam such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, to name just a few, and they all touch upon the theme concerning the rigors, sadness and horrors of war. This film's twist was to bring a touch of comedy to the misery of the war itself, much like the show M*A*S*H attempted to do. Adrian repeatedly raised the ire of the two officers by doing ""skits"" where he would change his voice to famous people and conduct phony interviews with them, make sound effects, and play music they considered wrong. In his own way he stated his opinions and versions on issues of the world. One of the many things that angered Adrian was that he couldn't present many news articles, nor always tell the full news stories. He felt they were masking reality from the enlisted men. He made you laugh but between the lines, you felt his sarcasm, frustration, and mockery of things going on. When he did disobey and enlightened everyone to the bombing at Jimmy Wan's he was pulled off the air. This gave Lieutenant Hauk a chance to shine as the DJ which he didn't. He was not funny and actually thought the men would want to hear polka songs. Adrian truthfully did not want to return to the air even after countless letters implored for his return. Thanks to Garlick stopping on the road as troops were about to go into battle, Adrian was pressed into an impromptu ""show"". It was then he realized that his show was extremely vital to the men for coping with the anguish of the war. One of the saddest parts of the movie is when Adrian realized that Traun, who he considered a good friend, was in actuality a VC operative. It hurt him to know that Traun was behind the bombing of the G.I. bar. Because of this revelation and friendship, Dickerson is overjoyed to be able to give Adrian an honorable discharge. Even at the end of the movie, Adrian's character is revealed. He stops on the way to the airport, to set up a softball game with the members from his English class. Garlick takes over as the DJ for Adrian, and plays a last tape from him. Instead of his usual cry of ""Goooooood morning Vietnam"", he responds with ""Goodbyeee Vietnam"".","Good Morning, Vietnam"
147,Guy-More,An optimistic film about a terrible war : people must remain optimistic.,9,15 June 2004,"Perfect film to demonstrate with humor and kindness the Viet Nam war. A nice film but not simpleton. Nice for the kindness of all the characters. A caricature, but a nice caricature. Whatever, the name I will give to the film I will qualify it by ""nice"". However, nice in a positive way, not at all simpleton or stupid. To have lived and worked two years in Sai Gon in recent time (1996-98), I was happy to feel the country I loved, although there are only few pictures who really show Viet Nam (numerous stages are shot in studio). I cannot separate this view of ""Good Morning Vietnam"" to the view of ""a quiet American"". Although, there were, maybe, less pictures of the countries in Good Morning Vietnam, I feel the atmosphere of Sai Gon better shown in this film. Photos of A quiet American were too clean, too nice. In conclusion, one of the films people need to see about Viet Nam war. Humanity has to be optimistic and such films should be made about all wars : when a Good Morning Baghdad ?","Good Morning, Vietnam"
148,mikekev02,"""And if you dooooooo...""",8,19 August 2006,"It's been a while since I've seen Good Morning Vietnam but I was reminded of it with the untimely death of Bruno Kirby earlier this week of August 2006. While the film is clearly Robin William's vehicle, Kirby, playing 2nd Lt. Hauck, is the perfect comedic foil. Kirby plays the uptight Hauck, who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone, in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line ""and if you doooooo..."" when someone, e.g. my wife or children, do not seem to be listening to me intently enough. Kirby does this in a scene where he is giving instructions to his underlings, who are routinely ignoring him as they comment on things having nothing to do with his agenda. This is a great movie. Williams gives one of his best performances, and you already know how I feel about Bruno Kirby. Another newcomer in the cast is Forest Whitaker, who would later make his mark in The Crying Game and as the host of the update TV series ""The Twilight Zone.""","Good Morning, Vietnam"
149,Joe1940,This movie knows what it is,7,25 February 2016,"Let me begin with the fact that I believe that this is a good movie. The soundtrack is fitting, the cinematography is generally well done, and the script, for the most part, is believable and well thought out. There are, however, some issues that take me out of my immersion in the movie. For example, the speech given by Tuan at the end of the movie was cheesy and forced. This is where I see that the movie understands what it is. The movie points out the needless presence of the military in Vietnam and that's the point of the move. Between the constant censorship and the multiple references to the distrust between the Americans and Vietnamese, the movie plainly shows the message that the Vietnam war was pointless and hurt relations with Vietnam. This does set up one great scene that I feel was the best in the movie. The montage of Tuan's friends getting captured and shot while Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonder World"" was a beautifully shot scene that perfectly summed up what the director wanted to show.","Good Morning, Vietnam"

Alright, so what do I think of this movie? I got to say, It was very funny because I think personally that the radio scene was so hilarious and it's amazing! The part where Robin Williams does the Wizard of Oz quotes and references, It was really interesting. I also heard on the movie that one of the characters said what Marx brother, Zeppo, The guy with the hat? That was so hilarious, I liked it a lot!! That was my short review on Good Morning, Vietnam the next review is going to be on The Truman Show so I got 99 more to go!","Good Morning, Vietnam"
151,suwitrvt,Good,8,23 November 2017,"Good Morning, Vietnam is a spectacular blend of uproarious comedy and emotional drama with an outstanding performance from Robin Williams. This shows us war first- hand and the horrors of witnessing it and comedy through radio broadcasts. This film lets us see Robbin Williams' cinematic gifts and how talented he is. The blend of these two genres is what makes the film so great and it's a non-stop journey throughout.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
152,phogmohone,Tour De Force,10,22 April 2006,"Good Morning, Vietnam is probably one of the most underrated films about the Vietnam conflict, loosely based on Radio jock Adrian Cronauer, the first man to play rock and roll on Army airwaves.Robin Williams, as Army DJ Adrian Cronauer, is at his acting pinnacle in this movie, merging between comic lunacy and gut-wrenching desolation at the blink of an eye. The support cast, including Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl also shine in this film, and special mention goes to Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steve Hauk, who almost usurps Williams from his comedic throne.Beautifully shot by director Barry Levinson and cinematographer Peter Sova in Thailand and with amazingly visceral cut scenes set to a backdrop of various sixties and seventies rock and roll songs. The montage set against Louie Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"" is especially moving, perfectly highlighting what it was like in Saigon during the conflict.This is a must see film for any Robin Williams fan, or indeed anyone who just likes a good movie. An excellent, entertaining and disturbing picture of the Vietnam War.","Good Morning, Vietnam"
