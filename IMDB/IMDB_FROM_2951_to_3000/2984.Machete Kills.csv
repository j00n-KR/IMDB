0,Leofwine_draca,Really want to like it...,5,26 December 2014,"The first MACHETE film was a slightly disappointing B-movie. It should have been easy enough to get right, but I blamed the film's lack of entertainment value on the presence of a no-name director. This sequel has Robert Rodriguez at the helm, so I was hoping for something a bit better, but what we get is more of the same.The problem with these films is that they're just too deliberately silly to succeed. They should have been played straight so that the viewers could laugh at their goofiness naturally, a bit like some of the more successful Asylum or SyFy Channel outings. Instead, these play dumb from the start, and the ridiculous script doesn't help. Sure, it has its moments, but for the most part there's just something lacking.MACHETE KILLS sees everyone's favourite Mexican B-actor, Danny Trejo, playing a Bond-style character who's sent on a secret mission by the US President (a well-cast Charlie Sheen). The story is preposterous, but there's tons of action here, none of it particularly memorable however despite the OTT violence and effects. Instead, Rodriguez and co focus on delivering a non-stop array of star cameos, some of which work (Antonio Banderas, Tom Savini) while others are just annoying (Lady Gaga).I was struck by two things: that Mel Gibson deserves better work than his villainous turn here, and also at just how bad an actress Sofia Vergara is. Unfortunately the viewer will be given over to such musings as they watch, because there really isn't much else going on here. The best MACHETE is STILL the spoof trailer they made as part of the GRINDHOUSE experience, because that's the only thing that got the '70s exploitation tone just right.",Machete Kills
1,SnoopyStyle,I loved the opening,6,7 December 2013,"Director Robert Rodriguez brings back Machete (Danny Trejo) in this grindhouse sequel. This time the US President (Charlie Sheen) has asked Machete to kill a Mexican crime lord who wants to launch a nuke at Washington. Only Voz (Mel Gibson) is the actual brains and has an even crazier plan.I do love the opening coming attraction. It has the most joy and comedy. The feature is silly, but not silly enough to make me laugh. It's never funny in the traditional sense. Danny Trejo is too serious, and mean looking. He's just not a comedian. And the shock of the B-movie schlock is gone now. The originality of seeing something different isn't there anymore.Every once in awhile, Rodriguez comes upon a funny setup like blowing up the wheelchair guy with a rocket. And there is nothing wrong with a girl fight between Michelle Rodriguez and Amber Heard. Although I think Charlie Sheen could be even crazier, Mel Gibson is too crazy. It's a movie where I could watch the opening multiple times, but once is enough for the rest.",Machete Kills
2,Prismark10,Blade is back,5,16 May 2014,"Danny Trejo is back in Machete Kills and Robert Rodriguez directs his once fake trailer from the Grindhouse films as ex-federale (Trejo) is recruited by the American President (Sheen) to stop an arms dealer (Gibson) and a revolutionary with a personality disorder(Bichir).The film is preceded by a fake trailer that includes Leonardo DiCaprio as the man in the silver mask, something to note for later on in the film.As for the rest of the film, Trejo chops, cuts and thrusts, there are hot ladies, despicable villains and star cameos. The film is cheap, sleazy and violent and carries the tongue in cheek sentiments of the Grindhouse movies.The sequel does not reach the heights of the first film when Machete's verve felt fresh. This film feels unnecessary with the jokes wearing thin and the plot forgettable.",Machete Kills
3,claudio_carvalho,Funny and Full of Action Cartoonish B-Movie,7,29 January 2014,"During an operation of a Mexican Cartel, Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) intercept the criminals alone, but another group arrives and a masked man kills Sartana. Machete is arrested, accused of killing his beloved Sartana and Sheriff Doakes (William Sadler) hangs Machete. But the President of the USA Rathcock (Carlos ""Charlie Sheen"" Estevez) pardons and recruits Machete to kill the revolutionary Marcos Mendez (Demian Bichir) that has threatened the USA with a missile with a bomb. Machete goes to San Antonio to meet the Miss San Antonio Blanca Vasquez (Amber Heard) that will be the liaison between Machete and President Rathcock. Then Machete goes to the brothel of Madame Desdemona (Sofía Vergara) to seek out the prostitute Cereza (Vanessa Hudgens) that is Mendez's mistress. Machete meets Mendez and learns that his heart is connected to the missile and only the arm dealer Luther Voz (Mel Gibson) is capable to disarm the bomb. Now Machete needs to bring Mendez to the USA in less than twenty-four hours and save his new country in a dangerous journey with betrayals. ""Machete Kills"" is a funny and full of action cartoonish B-movie by Robert Rodriguez with exploitation and references to the pop-culture and potential of cult-movie. It is intentionally cheesy and tacky despite the great cast and the cameos. The beginning is a joke with the trailer of ""Machete Kills Again... In Space"" that does not exist. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Machete Kills
4,nogodnomasters,JUSTICE AND THE LAW AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME THING,10,15 October 2018,"This latest installment is practically a spoof of itself. The opening scene of coming attractions had me laughing. In this installment Machete (Danny Trejo) goes to Mexico, gets a guy, brings, him back, gets killed, comes back to life, and saves the world. That is pretty much it. The film makes fun of society, especially beauty pageants. Charlie Sheen as president? The film has major league stars lining up to take part of the fun.This is perhaps the quirkiest in the series, taking the franchise in a new direction. There are flashbacks to a previous film, but knowledge of past films are not necessary, its a grindhouse. We watch it for hot girls with guns talking tough, heads getting cut off, and the explosions.Great with popcorn.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No nudity. 3D sex scene with Amber Heard.",Machete Kills
5,kosmasp,Machete at it again,7,23 May 2014,"A sequel that begins with a preview of ... the sequel of this sequel. So we get glimpses of what part 3 will (could?) be like, even before part 2 starts. I'm assuming you've seen part 1, it would make sense, but you can also enjoy this one, without any prior knowledge of the Original Machete. One of the better star guests is ""introduced"" as Carlos Estevez. Better known to the public as Charlie Sheen.But Machete is the main man and the legend continues and gets even further here. One of the weirdest scenes is playing in a sheriffs office. You'll know once you watch it. The comedy and the overall mood of the movie will not be everyones taste, but Rodriguez did a more than decent job. Some nice new ideas and some really cool action round the whole thing up. Be in the mood and you'll have a very good time",Machete Kills
6,Tweekums,More Mexploitation Mayhem,7,8 October 2019,"This sequel sees Machete employed by the US President to head into Mexico and eliminate
Marcos Mendez, a revolutionary who has acquired a nuclear missile and is threatening to fire it at Washington DC if the US doesn't invade Mexico to stop the drug cartels destroying the country. There is just one problem... Mendez has a device attached to his heart that will cause the missile to launch if he dies! The only person who can disarm it is American high-tech arms dealer Luther Voz. Machete grabs Mendez and heads north... a lot of people want to stop them though.I enjoyed 'Machete' far more than I expected so had high hope for this; for the most part they were met. It delivers lots of over-the-top action, plenty of gory deaths and special effects that are deliberately poor so provide laughs. The story is ridiculous but that is just part of the charm. As the story progresses things get more sci-fi; as well as the missile linked to Mendez's heart we have a shape-shifting bounty hunter and a megalomaniac who seems to have been inspired by the plot of the film 'Moonraker'! As with the original this features several well-known actors all of whom are happy to turn things up to eleven in roles that are never going to win anybody serious awards. The ending points to another sequel; 'Machete Kills Again... In Space'... whether it will be made remains to be scene; I certainly hope it is! On the down side it does drag a bit in places; I suspect it would have been better if it had been cut down to ninety minutes. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody; some will love it's over the top style and refusal to take itself seriously; others will have it for the same reason. If you liked 'Machete' I'd certainly recommend this even though I consider the original to be slightly superior.",Machete Kills
7,BA_Harrison,"Move over, Speedy Gonzales!",8,17 December 2013,"In Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills, Danny Trejo's character—deadly Mexican secret agent Machete Cortez—is about as three-dimensional and grounded in realism as a Looney Tunes cartoon character tripping on peyote. For many, this move towards a crazier style with even more unbelievable splatstick violence will be a step too far, the live-action-cartoon style antics exceeding many people's willingness to suspend disbelief. However, those who can find their way safely past this potential stumbling block should have a whale of a time.Rodriguez directs proceedings with a carefree attitude and sense of fun that I found infectious, with all ideas—no matter how dumb they must have looked on paper—making their way into the final film. Thus, we have a Bond-style baddie in the form of megalomaniac Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), our hero killing numerous henchmen in a variety of creative ways, some innovative sci-fi weaponry, plenty of cool in-jokes for us movie geeks (I loved the visual reference to Mad Max II) and a bevy of lovely latino babes in sexy gear (including Alexa Vega in PVC and Michelle Rodriguez in tight, cleavage enhancing top). Hell, Rodriguez is having so much fun that he doesn't even care about the quality of his CGI, which only adds to the gleefully gaudy vibe.It all gets very silly, and with the next sequel featuring Machete in space, it's set to get a whole lot sillier; I for one will make sure I've booked my seat for the ride.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for being marginally more fun than the first one.",Machete Kills
8,paul_haakonsen,Machete don't fail...,7,14 November 2013,"""Machete Kills"" is every bit as cool, action-packed, fun and entertaining as the 2010 ""Machete"" movie. If you enjoyed the first movie, then you will most definitely enjoy the sequel.The action is so outrageous and hilarious at the same time, and it is really well pulled off. Director Robert Rodriguez most definitely has tapped into something great here.The story is fairly similar to the story in the first movie, but yet it differs so much. Machete is hired by the president of the United States of America to take out a person in Mexico who poses a real and imminent threat to Washington.The amount of talent that appears in the movie is just amazing, as it was in the 2010 movie. There are really a lot of great names in major and minor roles here. And that does help to add to the overall enjoyment of ""Machete Kills"". Personally, I am not overly sure about the choice of Lady Gaga in that particular role - but hey, it is all a matter of personal preference.And the trailer for ""Machete Kills Again - In Space"", that is just brilliant. Such a great way to keep the audience hooked and waiting for the third movie. It does look campy and cheesy, yes, but we all know that we are going to be watching it.Great characters, great dialogue, great action, great movie.",Machete Kills
9,Coventry,Cheers to Robert Rodriguez; - everybody's favorite ADHD director!,6,16 June 2020,"Your name seriously has to be Robert Rodriguez in order to get away with something like ""Machete Kills"". How many directors, you think, can afford themselves to come up with a film of which the plot appears to be improvised whilst shooting, the characters have an average life-expectancy of three-and-a-half minutes, and the special effects are so tremendously grotesque and yet deliberately cheap-looking? Not many, I assure you, but Rodriguez can! ""Machete"" started out as a fake trailer for Rodriguez' (and Tarantino's) homage project ""Grindhouse"", but it was plain clear from the start that it was too popular to remain an insignificant footnote or a minor gimmick. ""Machete"" received its own franchise, with finally a leading role for Danny Trejo, but luckily Señor Rodriguez continued NOT to take it too seriously. The original ""Machete"" was a tongue-in-cheek actioner, and the sequel ""Machete Kills"" is even more of an undemanding and chaotic smorgasbord of cartoonesque craziness. Rodriguez has the ""cohones"" to cast fallen Hollywood icons Charlie Sheen as a megalomaniacal American President, and Mel Gibson as a villain who's a hybrid between Elon Musk and Ernst Stavro Blofeld. His protagonist hero hangs on the propeller of a helicopter to chop off heads and jumps off without filling even slightly dizzy. There are experimental guns that turn people inside out, beauty queens that turn out to be stone-cold killers, and a hired assassin who changes his/her appearance no less than four times over the course of one film. If all these, and many more, aren't enough indicators not to take ""Machete Kills"" too seriously, then you only have yourself to blame. Watch it like Rodriguez wants you to enjoy it: with all your brain functions switched off, and with beers and pizza within hands' reach.",Machete Kills
10,Scarecrow-88,Machete Kills,6,4 May 2014,"With a third film in mind, Machete Kills is about setting it up, I'm afraid. There are tons of decapitations and two different kinds of re-vamped machete weapons that do some serious damage. Needed by the President of the United States (Charlie Sheen as a joke) to stop a ""mad Mexican"" with multiple-personality-disorder (Demian Bichir, ""The Bridge""), Machete (Danny Trejo, holding a stone-face throughout) will journey across the border into Mexico to find him. Machete discovers that the dangerous criminal, Mendez (Bichir), alternating between a heroic, burdened revolutionary and deranged cartel wacko has designed a device strapped to his heart that will ignite a missile aimed for The White House if he is killed. Machete must kidnap Mendez and keep him from death as a bounty is out for both of them. That and a man-hating Mexican Madam with bra and strap on bullet-guns (!!!) played with psychopathic fierceness by Modern Family's Sophia Verga, a ""face switching"" hit-man/woman named Camaleón (the role alternates between Walter Goggins, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Lady Gaga, and Antonio Banderas!), and a sociopathic megalomaniac weapons-designer (Mel Gibson, with that psychopathic twinkle in his eye and firm grasp of how nuts his character is) with a James Bond villain warehouse (clones with martial arts fighting capabilities, weapons that can molecularly decimate humans or shred body parts with ease, and a space ship built to charter humans to a space station made specifically as a new place to live after global apocalypse (this made possible by him, of course)). Also included is a beauty pageant agent (Amber Heard, fully understanding how her looks have benefited her in the film industry) who may or may not can be trusted (who is she actually working for; it first seems like the President, but her pageants are sponsored by Gibson) and returning eye-patch revolutionary Luz (Michelle Rodriguez, looking mighty fine). The whole film is a design to absurdly present Machete as this unkillable killing machine—a character right out of the 80s era of action heroes—who takes a licking and keeps on ticking. However, I quickly tired of the dependence on CGI action sequencesthis is something I certainly miss from the 80s when real cars, planes, and boats went KABOOM! I'm not entirely sure there was some big demand for a sequel to the okay ""Machete"", and GRINDHOUSE has nearly played out as imitators (some quite awesome like ""Hobo with a Shotgun"") come out of the woodwork since 2007. I think this sequel (a flop at the box office) should have been a sign that the audience who jived to GRINDHOUSE have perhaps moved on. Some filmmakers (with far lower budgets) have taken what their predecessors started and went further as far as exploitative elements go. Still seeing Trejo returning as a badass action hero was dope, and Rodriguez engaging in gunfire and fisticuffs with Heard was a hoot. Lady Gaga's presence in the film (the marketing campaign sure made an effort to use her name in credits) might seem like a big deal but it is about as important (if less so) as that of Cuba Gooding, Jr. Mel Gibson placing a metal comic villain mask after getting his face burnt while prior to this trying to ""recruit"" Machete was far more enjoyable than I expected it to be. Jessica Alba has the ""opening character from the previous film dying early"" part. Thankfully there's far less emphasis on immigration politik and more humor used on how illegals get across (or don't) the border.",Machete Kills
11,LeonLouisRicci,"""Machete don't tweet.""",8,26 February 2014,"The Director has Created a Modern-Retro Genre and is the Unapologetic King of Kinetic Kills and Knuckleheaded Humor. Gore Galore and Gals to Boot in Sexy Boots and an All Star Cast of Been Arounds All Willing to Go Along for the Rodriquez Ride. It is a Singular and Unique Ride to Say the Least.In This Sequel the Tone is Lightened Slightly with Sci-Fi Added to Make it a bit Different and at the Same Time being Similar. Danny Trejo can Still Deliver as He Ages Gracefully in a Macho Kind of Way. Clint Eastwood must be Jealous.This is All Fun and Done with Workaholic Bravado by the Multi-Talented Filmmaker and Anyone Admiring the Director's Work will Not be Disappointed and those who don't won't Ever be Satisfied. These Works of Primitive, Subversive Art are Looney Toons. Rodriguez is one of the Cleverest of Modern Auteurs and is Still at the Top of His Game.

12,utgard14,Another mediocre effort from Robert Rodriguez,5,8 March 2014,"I wasn't in love with Machete so it's no surprise I didn't love this sequel, though it is marginally better than the first movie. Danny Trejo was too old and fat in the first film so you can only imagine what a few years would add. Seeing him make out with women young enough to be his granddaughter is gross. This sequel does have even more attractive women than the first film. Alexa Vega from Spy Kids is all grown up now and very hot. Sofia Vergara is a lot of fun. Michelle Rodriguez is sexy and badass, as usual. The movie gets a lot better when she's on screen. Mel Gibson returns from oblivion and gives a good performance as the bad guy. Reminds me of a time before he went crazy when he was making good movies. Demian Bichir is the worst part of the movie. I hope I never see him in anything again. If his scenes had been cut significantly, the first hour would have moved faster and the movie would have probably earned another point.Robert Rodriguez's love affair with CGI has ruined whatever talent as a filmmaker he used to have. He's so lazy now. The CGI here is especially lame and cheap-looking. The CGI blood and gunfire in this is as bad as anything The Asylum produces that you see on SyFy. It's really awful and he should be embarrassed to have his name on it. But then again....the Spy Kids movies. So obviously he has no pride. Also, bold choice on the minimalist makeup. It's not like you have a hundred year-old leatherface as the star or anything.",Machete Kills
13,zardoz-13,Machete Kills Again!!!,9,10 December 2017,"Danny Trejo reprises his role as the eponymous hero in writer & director Robert Rodriguez's preposterous, larger-than-life ""Machete Kills,"" a blazing, no-holds barred, actioneer about a former cartel leader turned revolutionary who threatens to fire a missile at Washington, D.C. Predictably, Machete is sent to dispatch this unsavory character. You cannot take a movie like ""Machete Kills"" seriously any more than you could take a Daffy Duck cartoon seriously. However, this is the charm of this outlandish epic. The ""Machete"" movies are all about guts, one way or another, and our hero relies on more than his own guts to get him safely through another assignment. In the first film, he used a dying man's intestines to rappel out a window, while in the sequel, he pulls a man's guts out and slings the slimy things into the whirling rotor blades of a helicopter. The chopper blade snags the guts and hoists Machete's adversary into them, cutting him to bites. In the middle of all this mayhem, Mel Gibson pops up as the real villain. Danny Trejo plays everything straight as if he were in a serious movie and this goes a long way at the end of the day. Charlie Sheen is hilarious as Rathcock, the President of the United States. If you're a big Jessica Alba fan, you don't have to watch anything after her earlier scene where she is killed. This is just as surprising as Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" where Janet Leigh was offed in an earlier scene. ""Machete Kills"" qualifies as big dumb fun! Let's hope Rodriguez musters the nerve to pull off ""Machete Kills Again . . . . In Space.""",Machete Kills
14,grantss,More of the same,3,22 November 2014,"More of the same...which is not a good thing.The first Machete movie was pretty lame. Initially you tolerated the lack of polish and plot holes because there is a style about the movie that covers over those cracks. But as the movie goes on, the plot holes get bigger, the movie gets more contrived and stupid. By the end it resembles a z-grade 70s movie. Machete Kills pretty much picks up where that one left off. However, it is even stupider and lamer than the first. Is is as if Robert Rodriguez is trying to be as silly as possible, and make a movie even more ridiculous than the first one. Even the semblance of style and swagger is gone, and that makes this one worse than the first.One of the few pluses is that there are some funny moments. The faux 'Forthcoming Attraction"" was easily the highlight of the movie.",Machete Kills
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It's what he does. But here he does it differently,8,23 June 2018,"Machete(Trejo, badass) is offered US citizenship in return for taking out a serious threat to the country: Mendes(Bichir, charming), who'll send a nuclear missile at the States. Meanwhile, is there something more going on? And what role does weapons developer Voz(Gibson, as charismatic when not in real life) play?This is really not about the lead. Still, among the supporting characters(including the ones that are back) there are numerous that are very memorable and fun. Tonally this is a lot closer to parody than homage(which the original was), which is unexpected, and I can understand, if not agree with, the many who thought this was a bad idea. While I love both, I hugely prefer this. It just feels like it fits more, to me. Both are over the top. This isn't constrained by an originally fake trailer(never meant to be adapted to full length), and so has a lot of freedom in its creativity(one of Robert Rodriguez' strengths). There are a ton of cool ideas here, and, hey, if you don't like this or that thing, there is a chance(note that I did *not* say certainty, some things do stay around) it'll be gone within minutes. The pace never slows down. the effects are distractingly CG rather than practical. The preaching is essentially entirely gone, thankfully. There is a ton of bloody violence, sexuality and strong language. I recommend this to fans of the writer/director. 8/10",Machete Kills

The slightly serious storyline of the first film as abandoned for a ridiculous rambling plot which blends spaghetti western, James Bond, and cartoon violence to eye-popping effect.It is more tongue-in-cheek than its predecessor, which is saying something and, like the earlier film, it is not really a very good film at all. But it is made with a kind of childlike glee - it revels in its own cheesiness, everyone is having a ball sending up the reference material (except for Danny Trejo, playing it absolutely straight).It is a hoot, and I look forward to part 3.",Machete Kills
18,gridoon2021,More of the same,5,24 January 2015,"More gratuitous violence, more jaw-dropping gore, more Machete quips (my favorite: ""Machete happens!""), more irreverence. And the same basic problem: although it's supposed to be fun, it's actually quite mean-spirited and ugly, with numerous innocent people massacred. You almost feel like you need a shower afterwards. The plot is pretty much a rip-off of ""Moonraker"", and some actors - particularly Sofia Vergara and Demian Bichir - overact shamelessly. There are some salvageable parts: Marko Zaror's amazing kicks, the muscular Michelle Rodriguez, the slinky Amber Heard (although their climactic fight is spoiled by silly dialogue), and Lady Gaga's & Antonio Banderas' cameos.

19,Wizard-8,Mindless violence ad nauseam,1,6 February 2014,"I like Danny Trejo, and when he gets a rare leading role, I am especially interested. Which is why I rented ""Machete Kills"". However, I thought that this Trejo movie was unbelievably bad, so bad that even Trejo at his best couldn't save it. Actually, Trejo here seems downright bored and unenthusiastic. Maybe it's because he doesn't get that much dialogue or anything to make his role a real character. All he more or less does is kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, and kill. This gets monotonous REALLY fast. It's true that the kills are frequent and bloody, but while you might think that this B movie lover would dig this, this is the rare movie where eventually I got disturbed by the sheer amount of sadistic and blood-soaked violence. In fact, the movie seems inspired by movies made by the independent Troma studio, but even the worst Troma movies usually have something more than just R-rated material, like characters and plot. The movie's director, Robert Rodriguez, has made some entertaining movies in the past, but for some reason here he really lost his way. Hopefully he'll have better luck next time.",Machete Kills
20,anaconda-40658,Machete Died.,3,16 November 2015,"Machete Kills (2013): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Danny Trejo, Mel Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Sophia Vergara, Amber Heard: The theme of this crap is vengeance and that may be what the audience will look for after viewing this over the top garbage. The first Machete was by no means great but its tongue in cheek action and humour made for at least a creative outing. In this sequel it goes far beyond stupidity. Danny Trejo returns as Mexican agent / spy Machete whose partner is killed in the opening scenes. He is recruited by the President to find a terrorist with a split personality and a bomb wired to his heart that can send a missile towards Washington. That's not all. He also has to deal with nasty pageant queens, brothel bitches with a taste for blood, and a villain who literally changes faces thus allowing some high profile celebrities to make cameos. Robert Rodriguez has an eye for absurd creative action but his Once About a Time in Mexico is a superior demonstration of his talent accompanied with a good screenplay. Trejo plays Machete as if he is in on the joke therefore allowing his implausible action scenes a sense of amusement. Mel Gibson delivers perhaps the worst performance of his career as Luther Voz, weapons terrorist bent on going to space. There are a host of fighting femmes including Michelle Rodriguez who ends up with her second eye shot out, and Sophia Vergara totally overacting as a nasty brothel mistress armed with guns in private places. Amber Heard plays a beauty pageant lovely with a knack for the sadistic. In the end Machete kills ninety minutes. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Machete Kills
21,FlashCallahan,As bonkers as you would expect....,7,4 November 2013,"The titular character is back, and this time he has to thwart Mel Gibson, who has seen Moonraker too many times, and wants to start a new life on another planet, and also destroy the earth.That's the plot.If you appreciated the first movie, and the whole grind house thing, you will find a lot here. it's a movie that shouldn't be scrutinised, and to be fair, it's pretty much critic proof, because it's intentionally bad.it doesn't make sense, Trejo is as good as he ever is, but it's the support that makes this film all the more mad.Lady GaGa for example, playing a hybrid of Gooding Jr, and Antonio Banderas, Charlie Sheen as the president, and all the usuals from the first movie and the Rodriguez clan.But the best thing here is Gibson. He is brilliant as the bad guy who has had Deja Vu for two years. he really relishes the absurdity of it all.I liked it, it was fun, but all the while winking at the audience.I doubt there will be a third movie, but count me in if there is.",Machete Kills
22,zetes,"A step down, but it's still okay.",7,19 October 2013,"A bit of a disappointment. The film starts off with a trailer for the sequel, Machete Kills Again ...In Space (I don't think the In Space bit is part of the official title, but just the way the announcer says it in the trailer is so funny they should really change that to the official title), and I think that's just to let us know that the following feature is little more than a bridge to get to Machete in Space, which will be awesome. Not that Machete Kills isn't brimming with a lot of fun, crazy stuff, but it just feels a little more tired, more disinterested than the previous film. Rodriguez again throws in a lot of ringers in his cast. The biggest flaw of this one is the character of El Chameleon, an assassin who is a master of disguise, i.e., a character whose existence is merely a flimsy excuse to shove in more cameos. The other bits of stunt casting work out fairly well. Charlie Sheen is fairly amusing as the President and Mel Gibson, I hate to say, gives the best performance in the film as the main villain, a psychic CEO who wants to move into space and destroy the Earth. Modern Family's Sofia Vergara co-stars as a killer prostitute with a gatling gun bra. She's amusing, but if you already hate her, you'll hate her here, too. Two other major roles are played by Amber Heard (fairly good) and Demian Bichir. The later seems to be having a lot of fun playing over-the-top. Though the film doesn't live up to Machete, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of fun with it. Here's hoping that Machete Kills Again is as awesome as it looks.",Machete Kills

What I did like was that we were thrown back to a time of drive-in and grindhouse atmosphere with a fake trailer just before the main feature. It was a trailer for Machete Kills Again In Space, the third entry if everything will work out fine.From the first moment it's all action and blood flying around but slowly Machete Kills turns into an exaggerated flick, Machete on a rocket bomb, really. I know that you can't take it seriously but it was over the top. What was funny of course is the fact that a lot of names do pass by in those kind of flicks. Amber Heard is a classic in the genre but with her new teeth it's still weird to see her abilities in a horror/exploitation flick but the one I was looking for was Sofia Vergara (Modern Family fame). And she did a great job. One who was doing well too was Mel Gibson. What a pleasure to see him back again on-screen.There are some good and gory (CGI) parts in Machete Kills but it clocks in over 90 minutes and for this kind of movie it's way too long. Machete did had it all but this was more about some super hero calling Machete. At the end in the theater not everybody was amused and myself I did have a bitter feeling too afraid to see machete going into space.

24,mm-39,Machete Kills is duller than the original.,6,13 October 2013,"Machete Kills is duller than the original. What did not work! A lot of the good material was used in the first Machete. Many of the gags and over the top violence was seen it, and done it before. Many of the good actors were killed off in the first Machete. The story is just too thin. I said to myself ""you have to be kidding me."" What did work! The thin story was so ridiculous it was funny. The merger of Star Wars and Jame Bond made for an interesting movie. Mel Gibson's silly role powered a silly movie. The shape shifter/Terminator role was entertaining. Charley Sheen's/Carlos Estevez's stupid role powered a stupid movie. I found watching Machete kills a good stress relief. A movie I turned my brain off while watching. I would V O D this one. Six out of ten. Not as good as the Original.",Machete Kills
25,siderite,The Airplane of Mexican movies,7,20 November 2013,"If I am to compare this - I guess it has become a franchise - film to anything, it would be with the Airplane movies. Back then they were mostly making fun of the plane disaster films called Airport, but also other films and memes of the time. I loved the first Machete, itself a movie spurred by a fake trailer, because it was completely over the top and all the people in it were clearly having fun. This one is even more so, but because of it it feels a little strained. Think Crank 2.This time they are not just making fun of Mexican action films, but also hitting on the likes of Star Wars and G.I. Joe. Indeed, the film promises a third part which will happen in space. Crazy fun!It's incredible what cast this film has. Forget Charlie Sheen, Mel Gibson, Lady Gaga and the like; it has a scene with Elon Musk! And Danny Trejo is even more... Mexican than before. You have to see it to believe it. And the cloned supersoldier Zaror (playing the cloned supersoldier Zaror) was really cool too.I have to say that in order to like the film even a little you have to be in the right mood. The movie is too little parody and too much complete abandonment to make any sense other than pure unadulterated fun. And did I tell you Elon Musk is in it?",Machete Kills

27,StevePulaski,The equivalent to that knock-knock joke that went around the playground circa first or second grade,6,13 October 2013,"There was a scene in the original Machete that featured the title character, played by Danny Trejo, removing the intestines from someone in a hospital and using the lengthy apparatus to swing down to the lower story of the hospital by crashing through the window. Long story short, it had to be seen to be believed (and comprehended) and that kind of consistent, rather fresh humor was what kept the film buoyant. When Machete grabs a hold of a man's intestines and throws them onto the spinning blades of a helicopter, all while the intestines are still attached to the man, the feeling of gross absurdity isn't so much a gory little stint of humor but a rehashed gimmick that brings significantly less pleasure to a viewer.Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills is a fine sequel, well-shot, directed with respect to exploitation films of decades past, and plays the kind of instruments you'd expect for this kind of genre piece. The issue is that after a collaboration between Rodriguez and Tarantino to bring us a ""Grindhouse"" style double-feature in 2007, along with a feature-length Machete film spawned from one of the double-feature's fake trailer, the joke has run its course. We know the filmmakers are not serious. We know they want to gimmick seventies style cinema. And we know that the actors get the joke. The big news here is we, the audience, get the joke as well, and Machete Kills functions and conducts itself narcissistically, repeatedly telling the same jokes over and over as if we've never heard them. This is the equivalent to that knock-knock joke that went around the playground circa first or second grade.Trejo returns as Machete Cortez, a ruthless spy who is summoned by U.S. President Rathcock (Charlie Sheen using his birthname ""Carlos Estévez"") to stop a mobster named Mendez (Oscar-nominated actor Demián Bichir), who has a large missile pointed at Washington D.C.. While trying to stop Mendez, Machete becomes tangled with arms dealing terrorist Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), who is working out a mission to try and create anarchy and civil unrest in several countries in the world. Armed with a crew of ladies such as Madame Desdemona (Sofia Vergara), La Camaleón (Lady Gaga), and Miss San Antonio (Amber Heard), it would be gravely difficult for Machete to lose this battle.Machete Kills, for starters, makes the same error that almost cost its predecessor its credibility. The film begins with a ""prevue"" for Machete Kills Again...In Space, starring the likes of Danny Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, and Leonardo DiCaprio (subject to change), which is presented with convincing film-grain, seventies-era cheapness, and pleasantly scuzzy picture quality. What follows is ""our feature presentation,"" which appears to be a grossly modern action epic starring big name actors (one of them is a pop singer for Christ's sake) and clearly shot with high quality HD cameras only assisted by strong special effects work. No film grain, no popping sound, no fuzziness to the picture quality. Just the unsurprising clearness of audio and visuals we've grown accustomed to in 2013.I give a huge amount of credit to the Grindhouse film that was released in 2007, as it clearly had intentions to replicate and portray what one would likely see in a seamy theater downtown, showing the latest low-budget action flick for $2 in a theater with colorful individuals, cigarette smoke, and a sticky floor. However, Machete Kills provides for the same kind of soulless action movie experience we've seen time and time again. And with names like Lady Gaga, Jessica Alba, and even Danny Trejo, who finds his name plastered on more and more direct-to-DVD messes each year, it's hard to feel like we're back in time.There is something I can't deny and that's the inanity of everything and everyone involved. Machete Kills is the rare film that can simply have fun with itself and that's something I truly respect and did respect in the original film. Trejo's tough-guy screen presence successfully carries over to the sequel, and the onslaught of actors such as the aforementioned females and other minor touches such as Mel Gibson and Cuba Gooding, Jr. provide for some much-needed smiles. It's also pleasant to note how the film evades cynicism and disregards action movie conventions in favor of a truly unpredictable series of events. Consider an early sex scene between Miss San Antonio and Danny Trejo. During the foreplay, an on screen title card urges us (by flashing and repeatedly binging) to ""put on our 3D glasses,"" which we don't have. After about ten seconds, the film's image becomes blurry and incomprehensible thanks to the known reddish-bluish hue the retro 3D put on older films. This kind of humor is what keeps Machete Kills alive and well.If there is a Machete Kills Again...In Space (which I'm beginning to doubt due to the dismal performance of this film at the box office), I'll certainly be in line to see it. However, in order to work efficiently, it will need to take a true step backwards and mimic the style of the much-loved (and trashed) space films of the 1940's and 1950's. It will need to replicate the cheesiness and the stupidity of it all, embrace its origin, add film grain, rely on its wits and respect to the time period, and cease with the glossy appearance we've come to accept in modern times. The Machete franchise is at that frightening point in its time where its next film can either make it or let everything it has built up until this point collapse; the sad thing is this is only its second chapter.Starring: Danny Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, Sofía Vergara, Amber Heard, Demián Bichir, Antonio Banderas, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Walton Goggins, William Sadler, Alexa Vega, and Mel Gibson.

28,KineticSeoul,Well it has more...,5,24 October 2013,"The first ""Machete"" movie is a fun gratuitous violent flick. This one has more craziness, more girls walking around with skimpy clothes, and more mayhem. But it still just isn't as good. The first ""Machete"" just seemed to know which direction to go. This one is ambitious, and I could tell Rodriquez wanted to fit a lot of set pieces and actors and actresses into this. But it just goes all over the place, without much sense of direction. There is a lot of violence and mayhem, but it just kinda leaves a bad taste afterwards. It's watchable and it does have it's moments, but that is about it. It just seemed to be trying overly hard to turn Machete into the Mexican Chuck Norris. There is quite a bit of well known actors and actresses, but it's basically cameo appearances and not necessary at all to have all these faces. It's like Rodgriquez got overburdened by way too many resources and didn't know what to do with it. When it comes to the craziness and lunacy of it all, it has Mel Gibson and Charlie Sheen together in one movie...That is all I have to say. The violent action set pieces, although more chaotic just didn't have that momentum or even shock factor. It just becomes numb after a while.5.5/10",Machete Kills
29,Hellmant,It's funnier and has hotter women!,9,18 October 2013,"'MACHETE KILLS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Robert Rodriguez's over-the-top sequel to his 2010 hit exploitation film, based on his popular fake B-movie trailer (which was released with he and director Quentin Tarantino's 'GRINDHOUSE' double feature in 2007). The film once again stars Danny Trejo, in the title role, as a former Mexican Federal turned unstoppable spy. This time he's on a mission to stop a crazy revolutionary and a dangerous arms dealer from blowing up Washington, D.C. with a missile attack. It was once again directed by Rodriguez and co-written by Rodriguez with his brother Marcel and first time feature film writer Kyle Ward. It co-stars Mel Gibson, Sofia Vergara, Alexa Vega, Amber Heard, Michelle Rodriguez, Vanessa Hudgens, Jessica Alba, Demian Bichir, Antonio Banderas, Cuba Gooding Jr., Walton Goggins, William Sadler, Tom Savini, Marko Zaror, Lady Gaga and Charlie Sheen (going as his birth name Carlos Estevez). The film is not as cool or entertaining as the original but it is funnier and has hotter women!The film opens with Machete once again being framed for a crime he didn't commit. As he's being executed the sheriff hanging him (Sadler) receives a call from the President of the United States (Estevez) alerting him that he needs Machete for a special mission. Machete's life is spared and he's called into the President's office where he's asked to go on a deadly assignment into Mexico to stop an insane revolutionary (Bichir) from launching a missile attack on Washington, D.C.. Promised his freedom (US citizenship and a criminal record clean slate) Machete reluctantly takes the job. He soon finds out there's much more to the assignment than he's been told, including dealing with a crazy terrorist arms dealer (Gibson). The film is even more crazy than the original and plays more like a spoof than an actual B-movie grindhouse action film. The first movie walked the line between camp and serious action but it had enough genuine thrills and stylized violence to make it an even balance of action and comedy. I enjoyed the original film more (and perhaps the fake trailer even more than that) but this one still has it's moments. Trejo (at 69) still makes a classic B-movie antihero and the supporting players are all topnotch in this one once again. Bichir and Gibson both make classic crazy villains and it's great that some filmmakers are still giving Gibson a chance to work in Hollywood. My favorite part of the movie was Vergara and Vega as dominatrix femme fatale assassins; like I said the women were much hotter in this installment and every time they were on screen the movie was definitely worth watching. Rodriguez is one of my favorite filmmakers, this wasn't quite as good as his best films but it still has a lot to offer grindhouse film fans!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV24sbHK5H0",Machete Kills
30,cherold,I'd rather watch the one in space,4,10 November 2017,"Machete Kills starts with a trailer for the sequel to Machete Kills. It's pretty funny. It's all downhill from there.Machete Kills is a parody of bad action movies, I suppose, but it reads more like it's just a bad action movie. The dialogue is awful; not funny awful, just really bad. The action sequences are over the top yet not that much fun. If not for that opening trailer, I'm not sure I'd even realize this was supposed to be a parody.After watching maybe 20 minutes I got bored and read some of the IMDb reviews. Some were so enthusiastic about the action sequences that I moved forward and watched one where the movie repeats the same gag within two minutes. I was underwhelmed.Not the movie for me.",Machete Kills
31,bensonmum2,"""Machete happens.""",7,8 July 2015,"Plot summary - Machete is hired by the U.S. government to find a madman in Mexico bent on launching weapons into space. Sounds crazy, huh? It is. As with the original Machete, the plot isn't as important as the action on the screen. If you've seen Machete, then you pretty much know what to expect from Machete Kills. It's more of the same with added fighting, explosions, and general mayhem. There are a couple of new things and characters in this one that I really enjoyed. I'll start with Mel Gibson. What a blast! He's so over-the-top, it's impossible not to enjoy every minute he's on screen. The same goes for Amber Heard and Charlie Sheen's (or Carlos Estevez) characters - Miss San Antonio and the President of the U.S. Awesome stuff!But, while I rated the first movie a 9/10, I'm only giving Machete Kills a 7/10. Obviously, there are some things that didn't work for me as well in this movie. First, Machete Kills would have benefited with more Michelle Rodriguez. She disappears for too long a stretch of the movie. Second, and more seriously, Machete Kills is really hurt by the lack of an ending. I understand exactly what Robert Rodriguez was trying to do, but it didn't go over well with me. Still, I'm looking forward to the next installment.",Machete Kills
32,Robert_duder,And the line is crossed...,4,1 November 2013,"Grindhouse was a brilliant feat of movie making. It was the ultimate throwback and gave Robert Rodriguez reason to spin off Machete which was an okay follow up. I mean, Machete as a concept is pretty easy because it throws all sensibility, plot and realism straight out the window. Machete can't have plot holes because it doesn't ever have to make sense. The first film was a fun ridiculous ride but to take it any further would have been foolish. Well he did and it was. Any even remotely sensible ideas behind Machete are completely destroyed for Machete Kills. Rodriguez doesn't even try for this to make sense. He is like a drunken madman/silly teenager running around going...""oh hey, you know what would be cool?"" There are a few mildly entertaining moments and there are actually a couple of good performances (one big surprise I was particularly pleased with) but most of it was simply too much. Laser guns, a completely silly plot that was simply in place to lead into his next Machete film and get him into space...(Seriously?) and it just wasn't as much fun as Grindhouse or even the first film.Danny Trejo is a B-Movie legend. Most of his fluff ends up straight to video but you gotta give him credit for owning this genre. He does alright bringing Machete back to the big screen and he does have some good lines. Unfortunately, the character isn't given any more direction than before so it feels flat and silly. Amber Heard is one of the better performances in the film. She is appropriately campy and villainous (and gorgeous but that's besides the point.) She holds her own in a smaller role. Michelle Rodriguez returns to her role from the first one and does alright but Rodriguez tends to always be Rodriquez. I was waiting for an epic cat fight between her and Heard and they do have a few sparring of words and a decent fight but far from epic. Sofía Vergara joins the cast as an insane madame with a myriad of genital weapons. She is also appropriately over the top but unfortunately she gets old quick and starts to become more annoying than fun. The two best actual performances in the movie are by our main villains. Demian Bichir did a solid legitimate job as a villainous Mexican mobster. He could have actually been in a more serious film Desperado type. I am the last of the die hard Mel Gibson fans. I remember when he was top notch and I think he still has it in him. I was doubtful this would be much of anything considering he shot the entire role in a week but I was wrong. He was actually terrific as Voz. He seemed like he was more in control and less frantic as he has been lately (Get The Gringo for instance.) He handles the ridiculousness of his role perfectly and is reminiscent of a great spoof movie villain. I was so pleased to see him doing so well especially in a almost terrible movie. Watch for enjoyable but mostly forgettable cameos by Lady Gaga (she did well in a very small role), Cuba Gooding Jr., Antonio Banderas and Walter Coggins.There is no denying that Robert Rodriguez has style and I think he's a very talented writer and director. I just don't think he took enough time with this or he got completely carried away which is more likely. He was so excited that enough people enjoyed Machete that he could make one or two more silly sequels. Machete is ridiculous and it is meant to be silly and bad but this one wasn't made with any degree of thought behind it. The first Machete had some promise but this was a huge slip save for a few performances. It doesn't even capture the exploitation films that it tries to spoof. It is unfortunately forgettable. 4/10",Machete Kills
33,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Dire sequel that falls flat on it's face from the off set,2,13 March 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMachete (Danny Trejo) returns, this time after being framed for murder after trying to penetrate a corrupt government installation. The president (Charlie Sheen) springs him from his cell where he's survived an attempt on his life, to track down Mendez (Demien Bichir), a misguided general who's planning to launch a weapon on the United States if they do not send in troops to combat the drug wars. But after capturing his prey, Machete finds he has a device strapped to his heart that he mean curtains if he is killed. It all ties in with twisted company president Voz (Mel Gibson) and his twisted plan to start a better world.Like the original, the follow up film Machete Kills is one I missed at the cinema, and despite enjoying the original, I felt even less inclination to get out and see it, despite it probably showing in theatres longer. Despite not being a massive hit, it gained a big enough cult following to garner this sequel, which repeats the zany, off the wall formula that made the original what it was. From the off set, we have Sheen as the president, with his office being referred to as the 'South West Wing', in acknowledgement of his father being the star of that show without the south in it, indicating the sort of 'not as subtle as it thinks it is' approach we'll have to get used to from here on in. It's on a grander scale, too, with what seems like a much bigger budget, a sleeker, more polished lens and a far trendier cast list, including the likes of Gibson and Lady Gaga. But it's all for nothing, because it's all just no fun at all, and annoying rather than enjoyably trashy.It's a wonder if the makers actually paid any attention to the plot at all, but you wonder if they meant it to be intricate, when it's actually just totally convoluted and nonsensical. The inventive, blood splattered deaths are back in abundance (including the intestine swinging again) but with a 15 certificate, a more sanitized affair is on hand, leaving the makers pandering to a more mainstream audience without half as much effect. The plot plays out as it does, and by the end it's all guns blazing, limbs flying, punches hitting all over the shop, but you'll be so bored it's unbelievable.A character from a fake trailer was a very weak premise to base a film on in the first place, they just had to push their luck with this lame sequel. One can only hope that the Machete Kills Again...In Space trailer was a real joke rather than a real in one. *",Machete Kills
34,bowmanblue,Put your brain on hold and just enjoy,8,25 June 2014,"Okay, if you didn't know... 'Machete Kills' is the sequel to a film that was born out of a spoof trailer for a deliberately awful action film (also known as 'grindhouse' to some). Therefore, this is supposed to be stupid, dumb, low-brow and deliberately cheesy. And it does all of that and more.You should probably track down the trailer for the original film and watch it. Then, if you decide it's your cup of tea, then it probably is. It's about the titular character 'Machete' who gets roped into another quest of bloodthirsty, violent revenge and retribution. Expect plenty of hacking up of hundreds of faceless minions at the hands of our Mexican anti-hero (not to mention some stunning women thrown into the mix).If you like big, dumb action epics then you can't go far wrong here. However, if you're into deep and meaningful dialogue, mixed with intricate character arcs and clever plot twists then this is probably not for you.The only criticism that certain fans of the original have been making have been that the Machete franchise seems to have strayed genres slightly. The original was a straight out action adventure, whereas this one seems to borrow heavily from the spy/Bond blueprint. Personally, I just enjoyed the ride, but some took it a bit too seriously.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Machete Kills
35,g-bodyl,Grisly and Over-the-top!,7,23 December 2014,"Those who are familiar with Robert Rodriguez films know his filming style and his techniques in creating exploitation films. In other words, Machete Kills, the sequel to the 2010 film, is just more of the same. I thought the original film was fun. The sequel is sort of fun, but it's more confusing. It's as if the desert sun was boiling Rodriguez's brain while making the film and as a result, we have half a movie. The movie retains it's grisly gore and over-the-top humor and two things I liked was how it made fun of Star Wars and how it made fun of American perceptions of Mexicans.There really isn't much of a plot to speak of as the film seems mostly disjointed. To make things easy, the plot consists of Machete, who has been recruited by the President, to take down an overzealous, maniacal tycoon who plans on destroying Earth while he escapes via space shuttle.The film has decent acting. Danny Trejo returns as Machete and does what is required of his skills. Mel Gibson is great as the main villain. I also like how Cuba Gooding Jr, Walt Goggins, Lady Gaga, and Antonio Banderas all play the same character and to solid results. Sofia Vergara is over-the-top, but I liked her breast guns. Finally, Charlie Sheen as the President is just spot-on and is essentially a spoof of himself.Overall, Machete Kills is not nearly as good as the first film, but it manages to be entertaining enough, just barely though. It has plenty of violence and lots of gore, so expect lots of blood and chopped-off heads. However, the violence doesn't seem meaningful as the last film as the body count in this one is particularly high. The film tries to be funny and sometimes it succeeds, other times it does not. But on the whole, this is your typical Robert Rodriguez film and fans will not be disappointed. I rate this film 7/10.",Machete Kills

It seems to me that his goal in movie making is to get as many people he can to appear and make a movie in 2 weeks, then spend months doing CGI on it to make it appear better. He forgot that the most important thing in movies is the actors and script. No amount of effects can make up for that. This is an example of that.

That being said, I wasn't sure how I felt about a sequel. My skepticism turned out to be correct. This sequel forgets what made the movie so successful. It has plenty of action, but It's way too OTT and cartoonish to be fully enjoyable. It does have some enjoyable moments for sure, but nowhere near the level of the first movie. It lacks the vibrant energy of the first movie and the plot is utterly preposterous! I'm more than happy to suspend disbelief, I do it all the time. Robert Rodriguez got greedy, plain and simple. There is a ton of violence, as to be expected. Innards and guts fly all over the place, and that's only a very small part of what you'll see. Ever see somebody use her boobs as a gun? You'll see that here. The main reason I was able to enjoy this somewhat is because of the amazing cast. Danny Trejo rocks the Machete part once again. The bedraggled star kicks ass and really made this movie more enjoyable than it should be. It's a shame he does so many low-budget movies! The man has charisma in spades. Mel Gibson was the best thing about this movie by far! As much as I enjoyed Trejo, Mel was captivating. He knows audiences won't accept him as anything but a villain, so he embraces the hate. Mel was clearly having a lot of fun hamming it up. I don't care what he does, Mel is one of the most dependable actors going today. The eye candy is off the charts! All the women do well. Jessica Alba is only in the film near the beginning. Amber Heard's vindictive performance made my world spin. She can back-stab and cajole me any day. Michelle Rodriguez does what she does best! Play a bad-ass. Sofia Vergara does fine, but grated my nerves more than once. Vanessa Hudgens and Alexa Vega add flavor to their thin parts. Banderas, Gooding Jr., Goggins, and Lady Gaga all play El Camaleon. It was surreal to say the least. Charlie Sheen is great as the President. He pokes fun at himself on more than one occasion with self-deprecation. He was perfect for the part. The ending was obviously intended for a sequel in space. Thankfully, this movie flopped. Now we won't have to deal with it hopefully. This proves that you can have too much of a good thing. I admit I enjoyed it at times, but I was annoyed a lot as well. It's certainly worth a look, but it's nowhere near as fun as the first movie. Sorry, Machete! I've seen enough.5.6/10",Machete Kills

Which sadly ended the franchise before we got to see 'Machette Kills Again In Space' which is a shame as I thought it looked hilariously entertaining.",Machete Kills
40,Floated2,Some good scenes but Gets Repetitive,5,19 August 2014,"Machete Kills the sequel to the under hit Machete (2010). This film doesn't live up to the original but it still contains action, and silly one liners with a mad storyline which will definitely make you laugh. Robert Rodriguez director has something for gracious blood because the movie is full of it. If you don't take this movie seriously, which it is hard to, then you will be shocked from on scene to the next by the way that Machete lives throughout the movie. For whatever plot one would want to attach to this farce, Machete Cortez is trying to stop a pair of madmen (Demian Bichir & Mel Gibson) with a nuclear device from taking over the world at the behest of the President of the United States Because of the limited structure and concept of this enterprise, Danny Trejo is not required to act, only to simply look ticked off and throw large knives at people. Even as parody, Machete Kills is sadly lacking in any comic or inventive stylings and the inside joke wears thin long before the credits roll. Machete Kills contains some good scenes but the overall story and film isn't on the level on the original. It seems to contain a lot of filler here.",Machete Kills
41,poe426,Carlos Estevez for presidente...,7,14 May 2014,"MACHETE KILLS is yet another of those bad, Z-grade movies made with a Big Budget... intentionally. Sure, I love a good Bad movie as much as the next guy, but one of the things that makes most such movies so enjoyable is that they don't set out to be Z-grade; it just happens. Paying homage to such films is more than a little tricky- one in-joke or reference too many and you end up with something closer in tone to a parody than a loving tribute. (And, let's face it: most filmmakers simply aren't good enough to come up with their own classics...) My favorite scene in the movie was a deleted scene showing ""baby Machete."" THAT'S the kind of scene that could've made MACHETE KILLS a classic. (The ""baby,"" a child-sized clone of Trejo with the head- and long hair and mustache- of a full grown man, is shown floating in a jar. No two ways about it: it's the funniest scene of all- and it's not even in the movie.) There are far too many STAR WARS references for my taste(s)- with more to come, if the trailer for the next Machete movie is any indication. Mel Gibson (as the mad man who wants to take over the world) delivers the best line: ""America has always needed its bogeyman..."" One can read quite a bit into that particular comment... His initial appearance bodes well: maybe Rodriguez will finally venture into the realm of the masked wrestling hero. Such a venture would seem to be right up his alley.",Machete Kills
42,leonblackwood,You can't help but laugh! 5/10,5,22 February 2014,"Review: This movie cracked me up! It's so over the top and unrealistic that it just becomes enjoyable in a weird type of way. A lot of the killing scenes are just ridiculous, which is deliberate by the director. If you have seen the first movie in this franchise, then you will know what to expect. Loads of action, and silly one liners with a mad storyline which will definitely make you laugh. The director has obviously got something for breasts and blood because the movie is full of it. If you don't take this movie seriously, which it is hard to, then you will be shocked from on scene to the next by the way that Machete lives throughout the movie. But you can't help but laugh and enjoy how far the directors mind goes. I can't wait to see what the hell Machete is going to do in space. Enjoyable, in a weird type of way.Round-Up: It was great to see Mel Gibson back on screen after all of his mad mishaps. He was great in this movie and he should definitely return the big screen. Danny Trejo can't help but just be Danny Trejo in all of his movies so he isn't much different in this movie. The director really did push this movie to the extreme and I'm surprised that the actors could keep a straight face with such a crazy script. The weapons were great and I liked the Mendez, the mafia boss, who kept on changing his personality. In all, you can't help but laugh whilst watching the film and be amazed by the directors wacky mind.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $15millionI recommend this movie to people who have watched the first Machete and who are into wacky movies with loads of violence and a crazy storyline. 5/10",Machete Kills
43,damianphelps,If James Bond Took Cocaine...You Would Get Machete,6,19 January 2021,"Completely ridiculous, but fun movie.The cast is quite high profile with imbedded personalities that we are all familiar with so it adds a kind of credence to the film.The film also feels like an alternative universe to the El Mariachi films. A crossover film one day could be pretty cool.Lots of explosions, light on for realism and an ok piece of fun!",Machete Kills
44,videorama-759-859391,A more insane and wilder Machete of excessive proportions,7,14 December 2013,"Machete Kills, more insane, than it's predecessor is like a roller-coaster ride of shocks and surprises, with little time to catch your breath. A great cast line of old and new faces, the best performance, that of Gibson as Luther Vox, who has diabolical plans for the future of U.S. citizens, by launching a rocket into space, eradicating everyone, so a new evil race can take over. Hit-man for hire, Trejo, has one good reason to take down Vox, as seen at the start with Alba's itty bitty part, Gibson, her shooter, obvious like a wart on a nose. The over the top violence, comical not shocking like the decapitation of heads, arms, ligaments, what have you. Wait to you see what Gibson's formula does, reducing people to jelly, where if trouble gets in his way, as he has a few hundred clones on stand by. He plays evil great and has a ball doing it. He also has a few nasty weapons of death, one a big sharp slicer, shaped like the Batman and Robin logo, you wouldn't want to be under. This Machete is open ended, so the third installment should be coming in the not too distant future. Imagining a movie more insane and wild than this is frightening. Just take this movie for what is, a wild, exciting, escapist ride, with ludicrous moments, more so near the end.",Machete Kills
45,Vartiainen,Novelty has worn off,2,8 May 2014,"The first Machete film, while not great, did provide us with a lot of cheesy humour, blazing action scenes and that good over the top silliness that allowed us to kick our feet back and relax. Machete Kills, on the other hand, is still undeniably silly, but lacks that sharpness that made the first film feel like a cohesive whole.I blame this on poorer screen writing and the fact that it's just the first Machete all over again with very little changes. I'm also not a huge fan of the cast here. Both Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez have very minor roles, which don't amount to much. I especially missed Rodriguez in almost every scene and every scene she was in was instantly better for it. Though, to be fair, Mel Gibson shines as the mad scientist Voz and Charlie Sheen as the president is as bizarrely funny as it should be. It's just the supporting cast that doesn't pull their weight, like at all.Plus I'm still not a huge fan of Danny Trejo in a leading role. The man is the perfect supporting actor, made for one scene wonders. But when he has to carry a whole movie, he just isn't that interesting. No depth, no emotions, no interaction with the audience or other actors.All that being said, the film is a lot of fun to watch. The action scenes are still way over the top, the storyline is suitably unhinged and it has that badass quality it should have. It doesn't take itself too seriously yet its masculinity is never in question. If you honestly liked the first Machete, then this should be right up your alley.",Machete Kills

47,billcr12,Bad Sequel,4,17 November 2013,"This is a poorly written sequel to the original Machete, which, at least had a cohesive storyline. Rodriguez must have been high when he scripted this film. The only redeeming feature is Charlie Sheen; here billed as Carlos Estevez, as the whacked out president of the U.S. His moments are too few, however, and cannot save this mess. Danny Trejo is good as Machete, and Mel Gibson shows up as a James Bond like Dr. Evil nemesis. Michelle Rodriguez is back, as is Jessica Alba; but they are given little to do. Several badly staged gun battles fill up the screen and I was extremely disappointed, especially given my positive review of the first movie.",Machete Kills
48,BeneCumb,Playful violence and witty reasoning - at the expense of credibility,7,21 November 2013,"Together with Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez created a distinctive depiction of fire exchanges and chases, often filled with Amazon chicks, awkward weapons and non-hitting bursts. It has become their certain trademark; moreover, they have went to extremes with scenes and elements already established in action movies. All in all, Machete Kills contains the above mentioned as well - you better cope with that, or skip/stop watching.Thanks to Rodriquez' fame, many known actors used to star provide small(er), but memorable performances, particularly Mel Gibson as Luther Voz, Charlie Sheen as President Rathcock, Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the second face of El Chameleón, Antonio Banderas as the fourth face of El Chameleón. Even if feasibility leaves to be desired, it is entertaining to follow how the characters come into life under their interpretation. As for the leading man Danny Trejo, his average acting skills are fully compensated by his looks and his full engagement.Thus, Machete Kills is a far-above-average sci-fi action, a good example of Rodriguez' signature and approaches.",Machete Kills

It's directed by Robert Rodriguez, who besides directing the 2010 'Machete' was also responsible for the 'Spy Kids' franchise, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and 'Desperado', besides a few others. This one follows the same formula of having over-the-top mindless violence and sexy women, as well as lots of cameo actors; in fact, there is a bounty hunter named El Camaleon that is played by about four different actors. Danny gets enlisted by the President of the United States-played by an actor using his real name for the first time ever on screen-to go down to Mexico and stop Mel from destroying Washington. Amber plays Danny's handler and go-between with the President, Demian is a psycho Mexican terrorist that works with Mel and Sofia is the man-hating madame-of-a-whorehouse that gets on the bad side of Danny. FYI: Sofia has a machine gun bra and she also uses a strap-on that might bring back memories of the one Tom Savini used in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. There is also a trailer for the next installment in the series, 'Machete Kills..Again...In Space' as well as a scene after the end credits. It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, language and sexual content and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.

51,lukem-52760,Very silly but fun Comedy Action piece of Grindhouse!!!,7,28 July 2018,"""Machete kills"" is absolutely crazy action packed ridiculous fun, i loved the first Machete, it was great fun & slightly more serious than this sequel but i did find that Danny Trejo was sidetracked abit with Robert De Niro & Jeff Fahey getting alot of screen time & here with the more ferocious, crazy, wacky & cheap & tacky sequel, it's much more about the character this time & this time Machete has become a non-stop & unstoppable killing machine lol he's like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees in some ways & dropped into a Spy-comedy James Bond Spoof type of flick, a crazy story about big dangerous weapons of mass destruction & tacky cheap looking 1970's James Bond sets with a splash of Star Wars tossed-in too. Robert Rodriguez obviously loves all those old films & the old cheap look of it all & Machete does fit in nicely to this retro fantasy world & it's all a big piece of B-movie fun. ""Kills"" is definitely more goofy & wacky like an adult Spy Kids flick but it is easy watching silly fun & it's grown on me & i actually prefer it now to the first film!!!Mel Gibson is fun as the main Villain in a very silly & comical role & there's plenty of famous appearances & a nice old fashioned Spy-Sci-fi feel & look about it all.The best thing about this movie for me is we get a good role for the Brilliant William Sadler, a great yet underrated actor & one of my favourite actors of all time, he's good in it as the Sheriff & just having Sadler in the cast is enough for me to watch it more than once.Love Trejo but his excellent Machete character has become a goofy,silly comical super hero-super spy it's all ridiculous, the gritty tough vigilante action hero Machete is gone & now we get a toned down version of Machete that's still fun but doesn't have that tough vigilante feel anymore, this Machete is much more on the fun side of action Cinema & that's ok if your in the mood for a fun Action-comedy.The first film more a revenge Action Thriller but this sequel is more spoof but i admit with that being said & with it's big difference in tone from the Cult Classic first film, there's still some fun stuff here & some cool moments & some good scenes it's just much more ridiculous this time, the look is nice & colourful & all of it & how it's put together is pure Rodriguez & i love it for that.I hated this sequel the first time i saw it & now i see the silliness & fun of it all.Trejo is still fun on screen & like i said it's great to see William Sadler in a role & he steals the show as the tough no-nonsense Sheriff that is on Machete's trail,
so Machete kills is definitely a disappointing sequel compared to the first film but is still watchable & an easy watching bit of late night entertainment, just at the really wacky humourous other end of Grindhouse Cinema.Silly fun, really ridiculous in parts but still has enough humour & charm & pretty cool action scenes to be entertaining like a B-movie should be but just not as well put together as the first film. Hey this flick grew on me & to be honest it's simply a fun action-Comedy & Director Robert Rodriguez obviously wanted to have alot more fun with Machete's next film & it is.Machete kills has definitely grown on me & i like it alot more now & take it for what it is, a goofy Spy-style action packed comedy with the veteran Tough B-movie legend DANNY TREJO.

52,I_Ailurophile,Unabashedly outrageous nonsense,10,4 July 2021,"Machete don't stop.No one who for one moment considers watching 'Machete kills' could possibly be ignorant of exactly what this movie is about. Its prequel was 200% over the top, and still this one manages to one-up that bombast immediately, with blood, gore, general violence, physics-defying deaths (or survival thereof), music, opening credits, and story beats that exceed the most wild expectations that anyone could ever conjure.What an absolute blast!The cast is extraordinary, and the characters they are given to portray just as exaggerated and blustery. Action sequences, effects, set pieces, props, music, dialogue - every single aspect is as extreme as extreme could be - untamed, stylized, extravagant, far-fetched, fantastical. The only way the Machete films could be more preposterous would be for the next film to go into space - and if the fake trailer that appears before the feature here is ever realized, that's just what we can hope to get some day.For all the absurdity and flourish on display, 'Machete kills' is wondrously well made, and witty. Editing, choreography, sound, wardrobe and costume design, makeup - even the acting and effects, as deliberately ridiculous as they are - all meet high standards. With each shocking addition to the cast to appear on screen I feel tempted to speak at length about each, yet before I could begin another pops up. Ham-fisted plot points shamelessly reference major sci-fi or action-adventure franchises, and even cinema classics, as the rampage of hot-headed, nonsensical fun continues unabated.If it seems like I'm repeating myself in the thrust of my words, it's only because there's only so much I can say without betraying spoilers, and only so many synonyms to describe the outstanding flair on hand. The only point of criticism one could possibly make is to note that among the cast there are some rather sleazy people earning a paycheck here, including a real-life villain who makes the final cameo. Yet, it's also fair to say - Machete don't care.This is a B-movie to top all B-movies. If 'Machete kills' is the type of movie for you, then you already know it. So climb aboard and hold on, because this doesn't stop for one moment.",Machete Kills
53,TheOneThatYouWanted,Better than the original,8,29 April 2017,"This is so much better than the original. I still remember how disappointed I was this the original after all the hype coming off of the Grindhouse mid-movie trailers, but that is a whole other story I am not going to talk about because I am probably never going to watch the first Machete movie ever again. This film on the other hand is a blast; mainly because they corrected the problem of relying on Daddy Whatshisface as the lead. Basically they made him a sidekick in his own movie, and there is nothing wrong with that because it works. Regrettably, we are not going to get a ""Machete Kills Again in Space"" because this film didn't do well, probably because the first one kind of su&ked. But whatever, I'm over it.

Danny Trejo returns to action as Machete when the President of the U.S. (Charlie Sheen) recruits him to take down Voz (Mel Gibson), a maniacal billionaire bent on spreading war and anarchy across the planet. Before Machete can take down his schizophrenic target, he finds himself doing battle with host of sexy assassins. While the blood flows freely in the film, the flesh is surprising slim. Thankfully, Alex Vega sports some sexy lingerie, spilling some sweet cleavage.

57,Sandcooler,"Entertaining, but it's getting reeeeealy self-aware now",7,21 April 2014,"I usually adore Robert Rodriguez' crazy over the top attitude when it comes to filmmaking, but ""Machete Kills"" is even a bit too much for me. The original ""Machete"" was already an (albeit great) excuse to throw insane amounts of cartoon violence at us, but at least it still had some ambition at being a movie in its own right. This one is really slapsticky and is also hurt by constant self-referencing and lame stunt casting. Charlie Sheen as the president is still slightly clever even if his performance is phoned in, but casting Lady Gaga as a hit-man went completely over my head. It's a matter of Rodriguez doing something just because he can, which usually turns out rather well but gets tiresome here. You know from the opening scene(a possibly real trailer called ""Machete Kills Again...In Space"") that you'll laugh a lot during this movie, but that it's also going to be downright exhausting. Even more violence, weird one-liners, bizarre characters, and redundant subplots than in the original, sometimes enough is just enough. And this is probably just a matter of taste, but Mel Gibson isn't nearly as entertaining a villain as Steven Seagal was. I'll take Rogelio Torrez' strange antics over Luther Voz' overlong monologues any day. The next entry in the series seems to be going the same way as this one, but I don't want to see it that badly.",Machete Kills
58,brando647,Insane and Awesome; a Perfect MACHETE Film,8,16 June 2014,"How did MACHETE KILLS bomb so badly? Anyone who went into the original MACHETE, developed from a faux trailer created for the Rodriguez/Tarantino GRINDHOUSE collaboration, and felt that the movie didn't quite live up to their expectations should've found everything they could possibly want in the sequel. All of the insanity that the first movie was missing is here and cranked up to maximum setting. MACHETE KILLS is not about quality filmmaking or themes or character arcs; it's about Machete. Anyone expecting more probably didn't know what they were walking into. MACHETE KILLS is the first of two sequels implied in the closing credits of the first film. As the movie begins, Machete Cortez is partnered with INS agent Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba, returning to the role) and the two are finishing a military- grade weapons sale bust when the arrival of a team of mysterious masked men leaves the mission in shambles and Machete in the custody of the corrupt local law. A well- timed phone call from the President of the United States saves him from the gallows and puts him on a mission into Mexico to assassinate drug cartel boss Marcos Mendez (Demian Bichir) who's got a nuclear weapon pointed at Washington, D.C. Machete will face a team of vengeful prostitutes as beautiful as they are deadly, an assassin who can assume any identity, and an army of specially trained clones in his most dangerous assignment yet in which the fate of the entire world is in his hands.If this movie were any more buggin' insane, you'd need antipsychotics just to watch it; based on the horrible reviews it's received, some people probably already believe you'd need them to suffer a single moment of the film. With the second film in a hopeful trilogy, Robert Rodriguez is free to do what he chooses without limitations established by a faux trailer to which he needed to conform. He also drops most of the grindhouse pretense, ditching all the post production effects to scratch the ""film"" and such, while maintaining the spirit of the genre in the execution. There's plenty of scene-chewing performances and over-the-top violence while story and character development remain slim to none. Danny Trejo is precisely what you expect and Machete hasn't exactly grown as a character since we last saw him. At best, he's softened a bit and seems to have some sort ofrelationship (?)with Sartana at the start of the film. Otherwise he's still the same scowling brute and man of few words. Don't come here expecting our hero to grow over the course of this mission. He's not here for an arc. He's here to gut some bad dudes. But Machete is Machete and you know exactly what to expect when you watch his movies. MACHETE KILLS delivers a hundred times over and, if I had any major complaint, it would be that Rodriguez relies on CG for most of the violence. Pretty much every instance of gore (and even muzzle flashes) are done with CG and it can be really distracting. The first action sequence, Machete and Sartana against some cartel thugs in the desert, has an almost amateur feel at first because the effects are so glaringly computer effects and all I could picture were poor actors all thugged out in the desert pretending their guns are recoiling while making ""pew-pew"" sounds in their heads.By far, my favorite part of MACHETE KILLS that solidified itself as some of the best fun I had that summer in the theater was the science fiction turn the film takes in the second half of the film. Admittedly, I was worried before I saw the movie because all of the synopses for the film were pretty simple and uninteresting. What they failed to mention (and what a fantastic surprise for me) was that this movie is essentially a two-part tale that transitions into the promised MACHETE KILLS IN SPACE. The first half of the movie is all about Machete's mission to Mexico and his journey to bring cartel/rebel leader Mendez across the border. Already, this movie was more fun than I expected. Demian Bichir is so great as Mendez. He embraces the film's insane nature and goes nuts as the duel-personality villain, shifting between psychotic cartel boss and sympathetic rebel leader at the drop of a dime. Then the film takes a drastic turn when Machete meets the true villain, Voz (Mel Gibson). Crazy Mel Gibson is the best Mel Gibson. Voz is a villain of 007 proportions with a master plan to repopulate the world with a master race and a talent for seeing the future. Literally. He invites Machete to join his little venture aboard his orbital space station and receives the expected response: brutal violence.Robert Rodriguez went full crazy with MACHETE KILLS and it made me so much more excited for a finalein space. With a supporting cast including Sofia Vergara (as a super hot brothel owner), Cuba Gooding Jr. (remember him?), Antonio Banderas (because it's a Robert Rodriguez movie), Charlie Sheen (as the President of the United States because duh), Amber Heard, and Lady Gaga as well as returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez and Tom Savini, this movie is loaded with people having a total blast. It's the best sort of cheese and anyone who didn't find this movie awesome probably wasn't in the market for a movie like MACHETE KILLS anyway.",Machete Kills
59,Screen_Blitz,Ridiculously over-the-top action fare settles for more extravagant mediocrity than cleverness,5,10 March 2017,"Robert Rodriguez's 'Machete' in 2010 proved to be a satisfying homage of classic 80s action flicks with its titular character showering his charismatic energy from nearly start to finish. Even if Rodriguez doesn't manifest much substance when it comes to bringing action to the screen, he at least knows how to keep things moving. This absurdly over-the-top sequel continuing the story of the title hero is not quite as fun as it sets out to be. While the first film demonstrated a solid obeisance to the hay days of 80s action cinema, this one operates more as parody, or in other words, an excessively violent Loony Toons episode. Blending with Grindhouse-style violence and gleefully absurd humor, Rodriguez's second installment to the proposed trilogy should have been more fun, but sadly falls short of the flair that made the original more appealing. Opening with a fake Star Wars-like trailer showing a proposed third installment to the series, this film follows the titular mercenary Machete (played by Danny Trejo) who's recruited by the United States president (played by Charlie Sheen a.k.a Carlos Estevez) to stop a Mexican terrorist Mendez (played by Demien Bichir) from launching a nuclear missile into U.S. Acquiring the help of Luz (played by Michelle Rodriguez) and a sexy, but vicious beauty pageant woman (played by Lady Gaga), Machete hacks, slashes, and shoots his way through the U.S/Mexican border in efforts to stop the devastating attack. Soon, he learns that the real monster behind the plan is an American arms dealer Luther Voz (played by Mel Gibson) along with his sexy accomplice Blanca Vasquez (played by Amber Heard).If you are looking for a smart action thriller with a concrete plot and story elements to fuel the brain, that is completely out of the question here. Lady Gaga playing an assassin? Charlie Sheen as the president? A woman using her bra as a machine gun? Those are just examples of how absurd this film proceeds. Although Robert Rodriguez is rarely known for pushing for realism when it comes to filming action, he operates this film to a level that raises the bar how desperately viewers are urged to turn their brain off in order to get past how wildly implausible this movie gets. Like the original film, the main figure of the story is Machete who is fueled with a fair amount of charisma and bombastic personality by Danny Trejo in terms of portrayal. As for the script and execution, that's a slightly different story. As Rodriguez continues with his style-over-substance manner, his mix of gleefully exploitative violence and gore, and cartoony characters manages to tower over the clumsily written plot. Watching our characters dismember, decapitate, and slaughter the baddies in gruesome manners can be fun to watch (unless you are turned off the use of poor CGI blood spouts). But without a clean-cut plot to the mix, it is less satisfying. The story advances through a string of mindless plot elements including the lead character's encounter with Antonio Banderas who's character is gravely wasted, and it all builds up to a climatic showdown between Machete and Mel Gibson's Luther Voz, a villain who's engraves the intelligence of Dr. Evil for 'Austin Powers'. Gibson's performance, while not bad, does little justice for how obnoxious his character. If his character is a villain not meant to be taken seriously, shouldn't he be a little more funny rather than buffoonish? Machete Kills is an over-the-top, go-for-broke action thriller that may offer a little fun in the category for action-set pieces, but fails to fuel the charm and flair that made the predecessor an entertaining hit. The original film is far from an action classic, but at least it was a slightly more sleek than what Robert Rodriguez delivers here.",Machete Kills
60,brchthethird,Over-the-top in all the wrong ways,5,14 November 2014,"While the first MACHETE was an enjoyable exploitation throwback, this sequel ruins any goodwill from the first film by going too over-the-top and failing to have a coherent (or closed) story. The basic plot is that Machete has to stop a madman from firing a missile at Washington, but along the way there is a lot of narrative detours that only add to the run time without adding anything particularly special. A couple of these include a shape-shifting assassin called 'The Chameleon' (get it?) and a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth prostitutes led by Sofia Vergara. There were some funny visual gags, but after a while the endless carnage became tiresome. Not only that, but CGI was overused to enhance the violence and most of it looked really fake. It was also painfully obvious at points that they were shooting on digital sets with digital backgrounds. However, there were some moments that made me laugh, a couple of them courtesy of Sofia Vergara. She was quite funny as the brothel madam, even if her part of the story merely padded the run time and didn't affect the overall plot at all. Mel Gibson was also good as the villain with galactic ambitions, but he wasn't used nearly enough. In fact, this movie has such a large cast that almost none of them (outside of Danny Trejo) were really given their due on screen. It basically amounted to a bunch of cameos, not all of which worked (Lady Gaga?). Still, Robert Rodriguez's love of cinema did show through numerous Star Wars references, of all things. And, if a sequel does get made, that's the direction he will go. This movie starts off with the trailer for its sequel, for goodness sake. That was pretty ballsy in my opinion. Granted these movies are cheap to make, but if he wants people to like it he should put in more effort. Overall, the quality of the filmmaking was dodgy at best; the plot was threadbare, but the movie ran about 20-30 minutes too long. Only recommended for die-hard Rodriguez or Trejo fans. Everyone else will probably be bored out of their minds and/or grossed out by the comically excessive gore.",Machete Kills

63,phubbs,Machete Kills,4,1 August 2014,"Hey I just realised something that I forgot to mention in the original movie review. You all remember Rodriguez's film 'Desperado' right. Well isn't the character of 'Machete' first seen played by Trejo in that film? the dude with all those small throwing knives strapped around his waist, its virtually the same character.Well once again this movie kicks off with those washed out, scratchy grungy 70's looking exploitation visuals. We actually get quite a neat little retro styled cinema introduction to yet another parody trailer for yet another Machete flick, this time in space. There is that same deep gravely voice narrating the trailer as the corny trademark infringing action explodes onto the screen accompanied by more cheesy action music and lots of hammy retrotastic on screen text. Quite liked the little moment where 'Bleep' the robot played by Justin Bieber (not really) gets blasted to pieces.From here on though the decision has been made to continue the rest of the films visuals in regular glossy Hollywood fashion dropping the rough grungy B-movie look. I'm not really too sure why they would do that seeing as that visual appearance is the whole point of the franchise, that's its quirky raison d'etre, without it the movie just becomes another daft action flick...only this is just absurdly ridiculous bordering on spoof-like. Unfortunately this is exactly what happens, this movie is so slapdash and crazy that you simply can't really enjoy it. All rules of reality and beyond go completely out the window as Machete is 100% invincible and can literately do anything that is required. Jumping from a great height out of a helicopter into a speed boat and taking out the bad guys on board...no problem, just press the X button and the right shoulder button to perform this special move.Thing is you have the same issue when reviewing these type of flicks. I know its all been shot like this on purpose, I realise the extreme gory bullet ridden lunacy is part of the intentional charm, I realise the characters are larger than life and totally hokey and the whole movie is just a big insane comicbook of violence. I think we all know this, but at what point does it simply go too far and become sh*t? The plot really doesn't matter in this film (Machete vs Gibson and lots of various henchmen) as its entirely about the action set pieces, one after another, bigger and bigger, more and more over the top. Nothing matters in the film anymore because the protagonist is so God-like its all meaningless, its like playing a video game with the infinite energy cheat on, fun at first but very boring after about ten minutes.There are only a few positives with this film, one being the unique mix of casting (kinda). The first movie had Seagal as the main boss, this time its Mel Gibson...and I can't deny he does save the day. Seeing Mel play the 'Bond-esque' villain is a real breath of fresh air and he clearly enjoys it. Lets not get carried away he doesn't really do much other than stand around and reel off clichéd dialog but his presence is felt, he oozes a slick charm that just makes his villainy so watchable (despite it being highly childish nonsense). The moment he puts the silver mask on the film just sinks to yet another level of utter childish meaningless futile crapola...yet somehow its kinda cool. Why would his voice deepen with the mask on? why are his footsteps now like Robocop? why does he not treat his face before putting the mask on? and how does the mask not move around and feel really uncomfortable? Pointless questions I know but I gotta ask.The rest of the cast are mainly the same as before accept we have more outrageous cameos this time. Lady Gaga as a hitwoman with a talent for disguises (I think)...this led to various little pointless cameos. Savini is back but has changed sides, Rodriguez still plays the tough bitch and still looks like she needs a wash whilst Charlie Sheen goes by his birth name to play the US President. Probably the second best thing about this film after Gibson, Sheen basically plays 'Charlie Harper' as the US President...which basically means he's playing his usual womanising self.The best description for this film frankly is a violent adult version of Austin Powers mixed with James Bond. It sounds like a cheesy thing to say (or type even) but its true! you only have to see the last half of the film which is set in some kind of big weapons lab to realise what I mean. Hell...Gibson only needs a white cat under his arm and the transition would be complete. The only other thing I quite liked was the fact the ending is open and leads into the plot from the trailer you see at the start of the film. The down side of that is the worry they might actually make a third film called 'Machete Kills Again in Space'! This may as well be a comedy because it sure as hell would be a total spoof of damn near everything ever. Time to let this go I think Mr Rodriguez, you had your fun in the first film which was quite good, but this has now gone too far, its been milked and the moment has well and truly past.4/10",Machete Kills
64,adamscastlevania2,"Not as strong as the original, but not bad",5,12 September 2014,"(49%) (Lady Gaga for worst support actress? She's barely in it for any longer than 5 minutes. Stupid razzies.) Pretty clear from the start that this is written by a different writer, as the original worked a whole lot better than this with only about half the budget. This really does feel more like a full-length scary movie style spoof rather than an actual sequel. The plot is awkward, and quite broken as it tries to squeeze in as many pointless characters as possible to the point in which it becomes almost mandatory to not give a crap about what is actually going on. Jokes are reused again and again, but there are some funny over-the-top moments (Mechete clinging onto a rocket, Mel Gibson driving a Star wars car), and for some mild entertainment this is not the worst by some margin, just a little disappointing.",Machete Kills

Yeah, it's got all the drive-in trash elements in tow: It's so over-the-top, it soars like an eagle. The most amazing thing is how his storytelling style seems to inspire the acting talent: They all give it everything they've got, imbuing every line, every move with transcendent camp. The whole picture glows, red-hot, with that spirit.As is usual for these flicks, the effects are great, the music is simultaneously thrilling and yet full of subtle artistry, the plot may reek of drive-in conventionality, but still dependably drives the flick decisively forward.Check it out.",Machete Kills
66,dave-mcclain,"""Machete Kills"" has no redeeming social value. It's just FUN!",7,6 October 2015,"Sometimes you go see a movie that you KNOW is not going to win any serious awards, has no redeeming social value and doesn't take itself very seriously – at all. And it's BECAUSE of all those reasons that you go – just because the movie is going to be fun to watch. You get all this with ""Machete Kills"" (R, 1:47). In 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez created a movie called ""Grindhouse"", a film which imitated the experience of going to a drive-in movie (ask your parents) to see two hyper-violent ""B-movies"". ""Grindhouse"" contained two full-length films, which looked and felt like a 1970s-era double-feature, complete with wild faux trailers in between the movies. One of those trailers was for a movie called ""Machete"" with Danny Trejo playing a tough-guy named after his favorite weapon and included the tag line ""They f****ed"" with the wrong Mexican!"" Well, the trailer got such a strong reaction from the audience that Robert Rodriguez actually made the movie! That was in 2010. In 2013, Rodriguez and Trejo teamed up again for a sequel.In ""Machete Kills"", Trejo is saved from a vigilante sheriff by an almost-too-late phone call from the President of the United States (Charlie Sheen, billed in this film as Carlos Estevez). The President convinces Machete (pronounced ma-CHET-ay) to go back to Mexico and stop a revolutionary named Mendez who is threatening to fire a missile at Washington D.C. Machete is a really tough hombre, but he has a heart, so he takes on the mission. He captures the dangerously schizophrenic Mendez (Demián Bichir), but has to get him out of Mexico, past a wall that separates Mexico and the U.S. and to the only man who can diffuse the missile, whose trigger has been surgically attached to Mendez' heart. To accomplish all this, Machete has to deal with Mendez' wild personality swings, a murderous bevy of prostitutes led by Desdemona (Sophia Vergara) - who is wearing some very dangerous weaponry (yes, wearing) – and attempts on his life by characters played by Walton Goggins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Lady Gaga and Antonio Banderas, who, in this film, all share a very unusual connection. Oh, and then there's Mel Gibson's megalomaniacal Voz, who is planning on escaping the violence of earth by taking a select few up in a space shuttle he built himself.If all this sounds dumb, all I can say is it is! But it's also a real hoot! Machete is a serious bad-ass battling a whole lot of merciless, but colorful villains. The characters, the action, the violence, and the dialog are all delightfully over-the-top. If you watch this movie, you'll get exactly what you expect – no more and no less. And you'll even get a trailer for the next Machete movie – ""Machete Kills Again in Space!"" I'm not even kidding. Until THAT sequel re-redefines ""over-the-top"", I'll revel in the memory of ""Machete Kills"" and recommend it with the only grade that I can give a great B-movie: a ""B+"".",Machete Kills
67,bellino-angelo2014,"If you liked MACHETE, you may want to reconsider watching MACHETE KILLS",3,25 February 2021,"The first MACHETE wasn't exactly high art but it was at least enjoyable. It had a backstory at the beginning and some very enjoyable characters such as the senator played by De Niro or the katana-wielding villain played by Seagal. Here however there are as many cameos by various known actors but it's not like the first one unfortunately.After the events of the first movie Machete (Danny Trejo) is arrested by Sheriff Doakes (William Sadler) who tries to hang him but he doesn't because he receives a call from President Rathcock (Charlie Sheen) that offers to give Machete his American citizenship if he kills Marcos Mendez (Demian Bichir), a psycopath who wants to blow Washington D.C. with a nuke. After meeting with some prostitutes Machete learns about Mendez's backstory and why he got involved with the people constructing the missile. He then gets shot by Doakes and we see him in a healing tank. He then finds Mendez's benefactor... corrupt businessman and Star Wars fan Luther Voz (Mel Gibson). After meeting again with Luz (Michelle Rodriguez) he receives some encouragment by president Rathcock who tells him to do that last mission for him. And then the movie falls into the boring zone.None of the actors looked like having the time of their lives as in the first one and it looked like they were there for the paycheck. Danny Trejo is probably the only good actor in the movie while Mel Gibson as the villain looked so hammy and unengaging as well. Sheen, Sadler and the others do their best with the material given. A few of the gory scenes played for comical effects were even grosser than those in the predecessor.Probably one of the worst sequels ever made and I only hope that its sequel MACHETE GOES TO SPACE (as it appears on Danny Trejo's films in production list) is funnier than this boring mess!",Machete Kills
68,bryank-04844,"""Machete don't tweet"" is just one of the hilarious lines uttered by Danny Trejo's iconic character, Machete Cortez, in this new fun-as-hell sequel from Robert Rodriguez.",6,22 August 2015,"""Machete don't tweet"" is just one of the hilarious lines uttered by Danny Trejo's iconic character, Machete Cortez, in this new fun-as-hell sequel from Robert Rodriguez. If you pay attention, you might notice that Rodriguez has actually made a 'Star Wars' film with Machete in it this time around, complete with machete lightsabers, versions of carbonite and landspeeders, and characters similar to those in the 'Star Wars' universe. With an all-star cast and even more blood, guts and kills than the first one, this over-the-top sequel is highly entertaining.In this epic adventure, the President of the United States (Charlie Sheen, billed as ""Carlos Estevez"") calls up Machete to kill a Mexican drug lord named Mendez (Demian Bichir). Mendez suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, and switches back and forth from being an evil drug kingpin, to a heroic revolutionary, to a secret agent. You never know what you'll get with him, but Bichir plays the character with gusto and hilarity. Mendez has implanted a device that remotely connects him to a nuclear warhead. If his heart stops, the missile will launch and hit Washington, DC. Machete accepts this mission when the President grants him U.S. citizenship and assigns him a handler in the form of a beauty pageant queen (Amber Heard) who has every weapon imaginable hiding beneath her gowns.As soon as Machete starts the mission, bad guys come out of the woodwork to kill him, including a top assassin known as the Chameleon, who changes disguises frequently and can look like Walton Goggins, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Antonio Banderas or Lady Gaga. After some guts are spilled and a few heads chopped off, Machete figures out that a multi-billionaire weapons mogul named Voz (Mel Gibson) is behind the entire scheme, and has big plans to destroy Earth and set up a new life in space.Does any of this make sense? No, but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun to watch. From Sofia Vergara's man-hating dominatrix who uses her boobs as weapons, to Machete swinging an enemy's intestines into the blades of a helicopter, you're in for something special with this sequel. Trejo has an impressive presence and owns the screen every time he's on camera, even if his monotone dialogue never has any emotion. The supporting cast around him rounds out this zany but brilliant action adventure. Yes, Michelle Rodriguez and her one eye show up again, and spill a lot of blood.This schlocky grindhouse material is what Rodriquez is great at. I can't wait to see the next chapter, teased in this one with a trailer called 'Machete Kills Again In Space'.",Machete Kills
69,Likes_Ninjas90,"A bad imitation, not a parody, of a genre that was already crazy to begin with",1,19 October 2013,"Machete Kills' one redeeming, clever moment is ironically a teaser trailer that opens the film, previewing Machete Kills Again...In Space!, the third unreleased sequel that will be set in space. Unlike the main feature, the trailer is short, punchy and very funny. It acknowledges and embraces the ridiculousness of the series and its own shoddiness. Comparatively, Machete Kills is a long, bloated, unfunny cash grab, lazily cobbled together to bridge itself towards another sequel. Its existence is hard proof that the evolution of this knucklehead series, beginning as a fake trailer in the Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodrigeuz Grindhouse collaboration, was merely bad science. The project granted action star Danny Trejo a new 80s style action vehicle to work in, playing a Mexican Federal Agent who is mythical and near indestructible. The gimmick of seeing Trejo on screen again hasn't so much worn off but dropped dead. This sequel is lethargic and tedious. It's weighed down by dull scenes of exposition and repetitive battles where the main character is never in any danger. Worse is the plethora of star names that do not phone in their work but simply appear. The result is a film that sets its ambitions deliberately low, proud and stupid, but even on that level Machete Kills can't satisfy and ends up being an interminable bore. The director Robert Rodriguez started his career with the impressive feat of making the action film El Mariachi for just seven thousand dollars. He also took test medical drugs to fund his short films. The problem is that he's never left El Mariachi behind. All his films, outside of the kids movies he's made, have tried to duplicate the same manic gunplay. His most interesting film is Sin City because it origins perfectly suited Rodriguez already comic stylisations. Despite being best friends with Quentin Tarantino though, Rodriguez is yet to challenge his audience with anything more than hyper-stylised cartoon violence.If the direction here is any indication, Rodriguez would rather be elsewhere. The dialogue sequences are long and poorly controlled. Machete (Trejo) has no personality and very few lines. Characters speak over him with boring monologues of exposition, lumping down the next phase of the plot. There are no jokes to lighten the burden of information. Consider this scene: Charlie Sheen (credited as Carlos Estevez) features as the American President who briefs Machete on his mission. The casting is the gag but there are no jokes to support it. Where is the punch line? There is also an unforgivable sloppiness to the film's editing too. The film jumps between sequences as though scenes were removed and they thought no one would notice. One moment Machete is on top of a car at night but then wakes up in the desert during the day. A countdown clock for a bomb leaps three hours in the space of one helicopter ride. The plot is a meaningless, disjointed exercise in finding different ways to kill henchmen. Machete is asked to stop a schizophrenic lunatic named Mendez the Madman (Demian Bichir) from launching a missile into the US. Mendez has a device inserted into his chest so that if he dies the rocket will launch anyway. Machete is pursued by an assassin called The Chameleon who keeps changing faces, and is played by Cuba Gooding Jr., Antonio Banderas and Lady Gaga, who make little impression beyond small cameos. Machete's allies are Miss San Antonio (Amber Heard), an undercover agent and beauty queen and Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), who has lost one of her eyes. The strangest inclusions are shared between Mel Gibson as a madman named Voz, who is a Star Wars fan, and Sofia Vergara as a dominatrix. It all ends so abruptly and anticlimactically that you'll wonder why you bothered. Rodriguez's only interests seem to be in balancing casual, juvenile sexism against an execution gallery. When the female characters aren't dressed down, people are shot, cut in half, sliced up by helicopter blades, burnt, stabbed and any other form of decapitation you can think of. Some of this is disturbing and ill-timed in the wake of real life gun violence. Other moments are tensionless, like seeing Machete shot to blazes, only to return injury free in the next scene. The more ludicrous elements, like the girl with the machine gun breastplates, are dismissed with a shrug of seen-it-all-before. Remember the girl in Planet Terror with the prosthetic leg that doubled as an assault weapon? That's Machete Kills overall: a bad imitation, not a parody, of a genre that was already crazy to begin with. Now it's just lazy and unnecessary.",Machete Kills
70,RevRonster,It feels less like a sequel and more like a parody of the first one...,1,2 February 2014,"""Machete Kills"" is pretty weakbut did I really expect anything more from a movie that is a sequel to a film that was created from a fake trailer? I wasn't a fan of the first film (but loved the joke trailer) but I get why some people enjoyed it. It's a hyper-violent dark comedy that was meant to be silly and over-the-top. However, this time around the film feels less like another Machete adventure and more like someone is just making fun of the first film. The jokes are painfully unfunny, the ultra-violence feels toned down from the first one and even though a lot of characters feel like they could be interesting and very entertaining, they just were completely wasted as they only acted as plot devices to extend the film to a running length and disguise the apparent fact that Rodriguez barely knows how to write a story.The only real saving grace, I found, was that Mel Gibson was terrific as the villain and was very entertaining. However, the rest of the film feels so lethargic (even Danny Trejo didn't look that into the film) that a great performance from a certifiably crazy man who also happens to be really talented wasn't enough to make the film watchable for me or even feel like it was worth the time, money and energy to make it.Hi!

78,jamiedarlow-37510,'Machete don't tweet.',8,30 March 2020,"Danny Trejo's finest yet and a pretty ridiculously awesome sequel! this time Machete (Danny Trejo) is enlisted by the government to hack and slash his way through to a deadly arms dealer (Mel Gibson) who plans on travelling into space and destroying earth. It's as epic and bizarre as that sounds! I genuinely think this is a case of a sequel improving on the original which felt really overstretched due to it being based on the fake trailer that was heaps more fun! This one manages to meet the superb grindhouse aesthetic of that trailer and keep you engaged throughout its hour and three quarter running time. It's gorier, more quotable and most importantly, sillier! A massive star cast including Amber Heard, Vanessa Hudgens, Charlie Sheen (sorry, Carlos Estevez) Mel Gibson in fantastic form and Sofia Vergara in possibly her best role to date; she's really menacing yet sexy and funny. There's also some really great cameos from Rodriguez favourite Antonio Banderas, Walton Goggins, Cuba Gooding Jr and the immortal Lady Gaga as La Camaleon! If thats not reason enough to watch it for you, I'm not sure what will be. Maybe the amazing Machete massacre using helicopter blades scene or the super hype preview of Machete Kills Again....

80,TheHonestCritic,This is the sequel to my favorite movie of all-time. Can it possibly be as good as the first one? Check out my review below to find out!,8,25 September 2019,"""Machete Kills"" (2013), at the end of the first movie there was a bumper that announced two sequels to ""Machete"" (2010); ""Machete Kills"" and ""Machete Kills Again"". I thought that just like in the movie ""Grindhouse"" (2007) it was only a parody made for fun. But sure enough, they decided to make ""Machete Kills"". Since the first movie in this franchise ""Machete"" is my all-time favorite movie, you can be sure that I had high hopes for this sequel. Most of those expectations were met, and I had an absolutely wonderful time watching it. This movie didn't quite have that spark as the first one did. But, it's still excellent otherwise and definitely a lot of fun to watch. The story is exciting/funny, the acting is great, the sets/locations are beautiful, and the soundtrack is excellent. However, the biggest nitpick I have for this movie is the special effects. You would think being a sequel, that the special effects would have evolved and have been improved. A lot of them do work just fine, but some of the effects look cheesy and even cartoon-like! Overall, this movie is a lot like a live-action cartoon. But, that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining and fun to watch. The first movie, ""Machete"" is much more realistic, and the special effects are perfect in that one. ""Machete Kills"" is a lot more over the top. Usually I'm not the biggest fan of over the top elements in movies, as they can be distracting. However, if over the top moments are fewer and far between and utilized properly, then they can honestly be entertaining and memorable! The story is a lot of fun, and it's a clever concept. As far as acting goes, Danny Trejo is once again on point (NO PUN INTENDED), playing Machete. The rest of the cast do an excellent job as well. The sets/locations are beautiful, I love the southern USA and Mexico landscapes! Finally, the soundtrack is brilliant. It is like the one in the first movie, with some recurring themes. But this time, with a twist during some parts. This movie is worth watching, especially if you've seen the first one. I can't see anyone watching this movie, and not at the least enjoying it. This movie is a great sequel overall! I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. On a final note, they still have to make the last sequel in this series; ""Machete Kills Again"". Will it ever get made? I hope it does, because the storyline sounds interesting and I would love to see how they execute it on screen! I'm not going to spoil anything, just in case you haven't seen this movie or the first one. Any way, if you're looking to watch a fun, entertaining and over the top action/comedy film, then ""Machete Kills"" is the movie for you!",Machete Kills
81,TheMarwood,Lazy meta exploitation,4,31 May 2014,"This cheap meta exploitation riff would barely sustain a running time of a short film and at 107 minutes it feels endless. Stunt casting of Gibson and Sheen land with a thud and less said about Lady Gaga's performance the better. Machete Kills is like a graveyard of careers, when you screwed up once too many, you'll end up here. And the usually reliably poor, but hot Amber Heard and the nails on a chalkboard sounding Sofia Vergara deserve banishment to sitcom hell for the reminder of their careers. Much of the blame, if not all of it should rest on Robert Rodriguez for creating such a lazy framework of a story and failing to pass it off as homage. It never once transcends his low budget inspirations, and falls victim to his rushed, poorly executed filmmaking. Nothing seems deliberately poorly made, it just is poorly made. A semi inspired idea to have part 3 to take place in space, will probably never materialize due to this film bombing in spectacular fashion. Rodriguez seems more eager to set up what could be a better sequel and includes a trailer tease, but he should have junked this script and headed straight to space where he obviously wants this character to end up. Maybe Rodriguez would be more inspired and actually awake when filming in space, but we'll probably never know.",Machete Kills
82,D_Burke,"""Machete Kills"" But Forgets Its Origins",6,18 October 2013,"First came ""Grindhouse"" (2007), a critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ode to exploitation films of the 1970's & 1980's. Then came ""Machete"" (2010), an unapologetically violent spin off adapted by popular demand from one of the fake trailers that accompanied ""Grindhouse"".Unlike ""Grindhouse"", ""Machete"" was a commercial success, making 2 1/2 times its money back in domestic grosses alone. Inevitably, there would be a sequel. Because of how much I enjoyed ""Machete"", I was looking forward to ""Machete Kills"" (2013).Unfortunately, while the movie's predecessors were aware that they were both parodying and paying tribute to low budget schlock flicks, ""Machete Kills"" somehow forgets that fact. The over-the-top violence and sex is still there, but something still did not feel right as I was watching this film.The movie starts out right as you get an allegedly fake trailer for ""Machete Kills Again . . . In Space"". In this ""preview"" (which may or may not actually get made in the near future), the film is grainy, scientifically unrealistic, and primarily fun to watch.Then the movie begins, and the film is as clear as crystal, the first indication that the director, Robert Rodriguez, somehow forgot what he was parodying. Based on the casting of supporting characters, Rodriguez may have also intended ""Machete Kills"" more as a second chance for once-prominent actors with now-notorious reputations than a tongue-in-cheek tribute to his love for fun, low-budget cinema.The original ""Machete"" was no masterpiece, but it was enjoyable to watch because Danny Trejo played an appealing bad-ass, and the narrative was solid. In ""Machete Kills"", Danny Trejo somehow doesn't seem to be into the character he made his own, keeping the same inexpressive face throughout as if he is already bored with playing the character.The story in this movie is also too simplified and hackneyed to accommodate as many supporting characters as it does. There's a terrorist who is about to launch a nuclear missile from Mexico to Washington, D.C., and is one of those villains who doesn't know what he wants to do with the world once he takes it over.While Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, and others from the original movie make welcome returns to this sequel, so many characters are added to this story that their presence actually makes the story more confusing. There's a Miss Texas beauty pageant contestant (Amber Heard) who serves as both a femme fatale and almost an Agent Q to Machete, a brothel owner (Sofia Vergara) with an uninspired bra gun which has been done in countless movies and TV shows before, and a lone assassin who assumes many identities (including Lady Gaga) who wants to kill Machete for reasons the film doesn't seem to explain.If you're going to accommodate that many characters, write a story where every character has more of a useful goal than ""Kill the hero"", or even ""Make a clever cameo"". While I thought it was clever to have Charlie Sheen be credited as Carlos Estevez (his birth name) in the beginning sequence, he served no purpose playing the President of the United States.It's as if the screenwriters just said, ""Hey, you know what would be funny? Let's have a formerly legitimate actor whose life is a train wreck play the President!"" Sure, Sheen smokes, womanizes, and swears in his role, but those actions alone don't elicit more than a chuckle.On the other hand, I bought into Mel Gibson playing Voz, the villainous operator of a weapons manufacturer who made the nuclear missile. Does Gibson's presence here show how fall the former A-lister has fallen? Maybe, but he still sold every line he spoke, and still showed his good acting days are not behind him.As for the gratuitous violence, I was hoping for more irony in what I was watching. Machete doesn't seem to have more creative ways to use a large knife beside slashing it from right to left. Plus, any creative ways a nemesis dies seems to be ripped right from ""The Itchy & Scratchy Show"" cartoon on ""The Simpsons"".If Robert Rodriguez decides to go ahead and make ""Machete Kills Again . . . In Space"", he needs to make sure there's enough room in the story for any celebrities whose careers he wants to revitalize. Plus, he needs to embrace the graininess of fun B-movies, and remember that even schlock fails without a coherent story.Probably foremost, he also needs to make sure Danny Trejo actually wants to reprise his role, because you got no indication of that desire here. Or, even better, give Michelle Rodriguez her own spin off as Luz, the Mexican revolutionary. Unlike Trejo, she actually seemed like she wanted to be there.",Machete Kills
83,Maleplatypus,"""Machette happens"" (quote from the movie)",5,16 November 2013,"Mr. Rodriguez puts trash to a new level. It is really not easy to review this movie. To only view it... Well, it has its moments. It is even fun at times but trash nevertheless. If you don't mind ridiculous ""plot"" (plot?) involving references to older James Bond (also trash, in my opinion) with Roger Moore and Star Wars (same for this one). Mr. Rodrigues seems to make fun of all of those and also himself. And Mexico (probably that's why even Mel Gibson is here, as some sort of ""Apocalypto guy"") and notorious Charlie Sheen (with ""and introducing Carlos Estevez as...""). And pretty women. And anything else, including Mexican drug cartels and smuggling people over (under, precisely) the border. It seems that no one involved in this production took the job seriously. You should not also. Add to that correct direction, flashy colors, intentional cliffhanger (yes, there will be probably more of this stuff) as in some kind of television series... I really do not know what to say about this one. It is mindless fun but more mindless than fun. Confusing, that's for sure. In the end, one question remains: Where is Mr. Tarantino, Mr. Rodriguez's friend, here?",Machete Kills
84,ghost_dog86,"Dear Robert Rodriguez, please stop!",2,26 October 2013,"""Machete Kills"" is the sequel to ""Machete"", but is so poorly conceived it seems more like a straight to DVD ""Machete"" that would come seven or eight films down the line.Synopsis: In this movie, Machete killsagain.The reason 2010's ""Machete"" worked, was the same reason a good joke works the first time you hear it. But if you tell me that same joke over and over again, with little to no variation, no matter how good it is, around the seventh or eighth time, I might punch you in the face out of sheer frustration. That's what watching ""Machete Kills"" is like. ""Machete"" was fresh, funny and creatively pushed the satirical boundaries. All ""Machete Kills"" sees is director Robert Rodriguez reciting the same joke for 90 minutes. In other words, the forced racial slurs, the same grindhouse visuals (but with not as much nudity) and the Machete don't text, tweet, or use any kind of modern technology joke scheme that we loved in the first one, comes off as tired in this soulless version of its predecessor.Danny Trejo returns as Machete: The only thing ""Machete Kills"" has going for it is a curiosity factor, steaming from the star studded supporting cast and the ironic roles that they play. In saying that, the roles Mel Gibson, Lady Gaga, Damian Bichir, Amber Heard, Sofia Vergara, Charlie Sheen, Antonio Banderas, Walton Goggins, Vanessa Hudgens and Cuba Gooding Jr. play, while had potential, are utterly drowned out by this garbage story, visuals which were as played out as the premise and the sound of nobody in the audience laughing as joke after joke falls flat.Final Thought: ""Machete Kill"" is indicative of the main reason as to why Rodriquez will never be the Mexican Quentin Tarantino. He has this tendency of creating these great ideas which he almost single handedly transforms into great movies, but then runs them into the ground with ill-conceived sequels, containing premises stretched so thin that they expose his once great ideas for how paper thin they truly were. Sadly, this sequel is no longer a satire on immigration, as much as it's an attempt to bill Machete as an ethnically charged superhero; which on paper seems like a grand ol' idea, if only this movie didn't appear to be such a slapped together money grab production.",Machete Kills
85,gregeichelberger,The only thing this film 'Kills' is your time,2,15 November 2013,"I was always told that if there isn't a lot to write about a subject, don't tax the reader by padding out an article. Nothing could be truer of this advice than my review of the newest release, ""Machete Kills.""I suppose some folks are going to criticize this critique because I do not appreciate (at least as much as they do) the insipid silliness of the first installment, ""Machete,"" from 2010. If that is the case, they will be equally distressed then to learn I did not care for this particular movie, either. ""Machete Kills,"" like its predecessor, is based on a three-minute ""trailer"" introduced in the 2007 homage to 1970s cinema, ""Grindhouse"" and by all that is logical, it should have stayed in that format.Other fake trailers included ""Don't,"" ""Thanksgiving"" and ""Werewolf Women of the S.S.,"" and while they were all certainly better than the two main films (""Planet of Terror"" and ""Death Proof""), they were never meant to be actual full-length motion pictures (director Robert Rodriguez had different idea with this one, obviously). With Danny Trejo (the bartender in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"") in the lead as a former Federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S., this was actually originally written as a feature movie in the early 1990s before ""Grindhouse"" was ever made.It's round-about journey to the big-screen was a logical conclusion, and while the first was praised as playfully ridiculous and a violent tongue-in-cheek satire on Mexploitation films, this sequel is a long, drawn-out series of mind-numbing decapitations, chopping and and gore-splattering scenes that would make a death camp survivor long for the good old days. For whatever plot one would want to attach to this farce, Machete Cortez is trying to stop a pair of madmen (Demian Bichir and Mel Gibson, and their hundreds of hapless henchmen) with a nuclear device from taking over the world at the behest of the President of the United States (Charlie Sheen in another example of just how far his star has fallen).Because of the limited structure and concept of this enterprise, Trejo (whose craggy face makes Charles Bronson look like Jennifer Lawrence) is not required to act, only to simply look ticked off and throw large knives at people (much like Bronson did in most of his films). Even as parody, ""Machete Kills"" is sadly lacking in any comic or inventive stylings and the inside joke wears thin long before the credits roll.Even the inclusion of recognizable faces such as Antonio Banderas (""The Skin I Live In""), Jessica Alba (""Little Fockers""), Michelle Rodriguez (""Fast & Furious 6""), Sofía Vergara (""The Three Stooges""), Amber Heard (""Paranoia""), William Sadler (""Iron Man 3""), Lady Gaga and Cuba Gooding Jr. (who should be forced to return his Academy Award for ""Jerry Maguire"") do not make this installment any easier to go down — or to watch for that matter.With much more decent offerings currently out there (""Gravity,"" ""Rush,"" ""Captain Phillips""), why not avoid this over-the-top stupidity and get a little more bang for your hard-earned buck?",Machete Kills
86,mistoppi,Just as ridiculously hilarious as the first one,8,20 December 2015,"Usually sequels are worse than the originals, right? But obviously no rules apply to Machete or Machete Kills. The weaknesses and strengths of the two movies are pretty much the same: They are both hilarious and amazingly violent. Both have easy plots and all that. The cast of characters is even more amazing this time. Of course there are some same characters in this film as well, but some of the new ones are even weirder. Sofia Vergara with the boob guns that could be straight from Austin Powers -movie? Cuba Gooding Jr., Lady Gaga and Antonio Banderas playing the same character? Charlie Sheen - I mean Carlos Estevez - as the president of United States? All the characters are ridiculous and greater than previously. Thank you, writers!Machete Kills made me pay more attention to the dialogue. Of course, again it was filled with one-liners, but it was very colourful. Like I said previously, the plot of this movie is very simple, but it took some wild B-movie extremes. It was amazing, and I won't complain about that. All those B-movie effects make these movies what they are.Machete Kills is just as hilarious and violent as the first one. I don't think it needs any recommending.

87,masercot,Machete Don't do Satire,8,3 June 2014,"Well, actually he does. Rodriguez spends a lot of time satirizing himself in this one.

Danny Trejo moves through this chaos with his usual grimace of malice.Are there any good performances in this movie? Not a one. The movie is not meant to be a masterpiece by any stretch. Most of the actors know this. It is simply a comic book set in the Rodriguez universe, with Machete, One-eye (She), Man-hater and Clone-man, who dies many many times.

88,jdring2007,"about as outlandish and ridiculous as a star-studded movie can get, but lots of fun if you have the right mindset",8,12 September 2021,"I loved the first Machete (2010), which was the mutant offspring of a mock trailer at the beginning of Grindhouse (2007), but even as outrageous as it was, this sequel has one upped it in every fashion. More stars, more violence, more blood, and more absurdity. It straddles an undistinguished line of science-fiction, makes fun of itself, embraces its parody nature, but still has dramatic moments. It basically excels at its intent, which was to be another grindhouse-like flick, a la its predecessor, and Planet Terror (2007). For this, I applaud director Robert Rodriguez. My only gripes with the movie is its length - it felt way too long, owed only to its unnecessarily extensive monologues - and Amber Heard. Her character was genuinely annoying and gratuitous in my opinion, but whatever. Lady Gaga was a breath of fresh air, her ""Chameleon"" character a vessel for numerous cameos. Bravo. Michael Sheen was also just great, reminding me of his roles in Scary Movie 3 and Hot Shots. Ultimately my favorites were Mel Gibson (who clearly thoroughly enjoyed his role) and Michelle Rodriguez, who kicks ass in so many ways, but it's a shame she doesn't appear until halfway. If you try diving into this movie with any serious thought, you'll be disappointed. Embrace the absurdity and have fun!",Machete Kills

90,achyutaghosh,Same old. Nothing new.,6,16 November 2013,"2010's Machete was classic grind-house fare. Building up on the titular character that has been a recurring feature in Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids movie series since 2001, and somersaulting the impassive Danno Trejo into super-stardom, Machete was a thoroughly enjoyable and ridiculously funny, 70s style exploitive cinema, with purposely trashy CGI, comic book style pun spewing dialogs, and caricatures impersonating as heroes and villains. 2013's Machete Kills tries to build on this, at the same time making a superhuman out of Trejo. End result is a few hits, a few misses, in sum total not as good as the original.The plot is borrowed straight from James Bond's Moonraker. A madman- Mel Gibson, plans to wreck the planet while himself sitting out the destruction with people of his choice in a rocket in space. At the same time he makes the grave mistake in killing Machete's girlfriend. In addition to revenge, The man who doesn't smoke, tweet, joke or fail now has a world to save. He traipses countries in helicopters, boats, cars and missiles (yes, missiles), slashing his way through cloned super soldiers, walls, tanks, and whatever else Gibson can throw his way. It is a fan-boy spoof after all, and so featuring in and out are lunatic characters- Charlie Sheen as the rocking President of the US, Amber Heard as a beauty queen/traitorous secret agent, Vanessa Hudgens as a virgin prostitute (incredible, I know!), Sofia Vergara as the mama prostitute with her assets always firing some kind of projectile, Demian Bichir with his multiple split personalities (""How many of you are there""- asks Machete incredulously) along with a bomb connected to his heart, and the best- The Chameleon, a face changing assassin portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr, Antonio Banderas, Water Goggins, and Lady Gaga, the last avatar a being an showstopper!Machete Kills stays true to the genre -another offering at the altar of the reigning god of Hollywood Mexploitative B movies- Danny Trejo. The entire franchise is build around the elegance of Trejo's moon surface face, no pun intended, and while the jokes the first time round in Machete sounded nice, the problem with Machete Kills is that there is nothing new to it. And seeing that this one ends as a start to a sequel that heavily borrows from Star Wars, (Machete Kills Again In Space) Robert Rodriguez might be getting carried away like he did with Spy Kids. There are some LOL moments, but not that many to make it a must watch- 6/10",Machete Kills
91,lnvicta,"Somehow even more ridiculous than its predecessor, but not quite as funny.",7,14 March 2016,"I love Machete. The character is incredible, the premise is perfect, literally everything about it just screams B-movie stupidity, and it's insanely awesome. I actually saw this movie before the first Machete so I wasn't sure what to expect, and I laughed until it hurt. Seriously, it was everything I wanted in a silly action movie. Machete Kills is somehow even more ridiculous than the first one, this time with president Charlie Sheen ordering Machete to go after a lunatic nuclear arms dealer played to perfection by Demian Bichir, and Mel Gibson wants to destroy the world and colonize space. Yeah, and you thought De Niro playing George Bush was crazy. Mel Gibson is basically a Bond villain in this movie. This is another revenge story, except this time it's Machete's love interest Jessica Alba who is killed in front of him. Needless to say when President Sheen asks him to go on this suicide mission, Machete isn't exactly in the best frame of mind. Then again, it's f*cking Danny Trejo, so he's awesome at it anyway. The first half of the movie focuses more on Machete going after this crazy arms dealer, with random villains like Sofia Vergara with machine gun tits coming after him. There's also the shapeshifter El Cameleon played by Cuba Gooding Jr, Lady Gaga, and Antonio Banderas. Literally the best plot device to get as many famous people in a movie as possible. Then Mel kicks in during the second half of the movie and that's where it goes full-on ridiculous mode (in the best way, as if it wasn't ridiculous enough before).After seeing Machete and Machete Kills back to back, I realize the only thing that makes Machete Kills slightly weaker is that the laughs aren't as consistent. Machete had me on the floor 90 percent of the time. Machete Kills is more like, 70 percent hilarity and 30 percent of jokes that either don't hit or are just repeated to the point of desensitization. Still, when the jokes hit, they are laugh-out-loud funny. There are gags in this movie that make the original Machete look like a documentary. Oh, and Amber Heard is the special agent helping Machete this time, and she tries to do an accent every once in a while and fails miserably, but who cares because she's sex on a stick. That's basically the trend in these movies. You try to analyze something and then think to yourself, ""Who cares?"" It's so damn entertaining you don't have to think at all. Just lay back and enjoy the gratuitous violence, T&A, and everything else you'd want in a ridiculous action-packed B-movie. I, for one, cannot wait for the sequel.",Machete Kills
92,dmuel,"sorry, this one doesn't quite cut it",3,26 December 2013,"Robert Rodriguez has made some very good movies, but this flick, much like it's predecessor Machete, is not one of them. Lots of stars poking their faces into the screen, but there's nothing to hold the thing together. This film is supposed to be like one of the cult films that Tarantino and Rodriguez admired from the 70s and 80s; flicks that were wild, over the top and fun to watch because they took themselves seriously. Obviously this film doesn't take itself seriously and, much like Machete, it runs on wild action, testosterone-charged dialogue and sappy one-liners. Where Tarantino had some success with parodies of cult flicks like Kill Bill and From Dusk Till Dawn, there was a thread of a story that held these films together and some interesting characters and dialogue to boot. Danny Trejo came to recognition in films because he looks like a stereotypical gangster, a part he played often, but only a bit-part, and aside from looking scary he has no real appeal on the screen. He can't carry the film, and neither can the dialogue or action. The film ends up being a non-stop run of macho one-liners, violent death scenes, and serial expletives that begin to bore 20 minutes into the film. While all of these are meant as dark humor, there's nothing really funny in the whole film. The film ended with a sort of ""trailer"" for the next installment which, unfortunately, is apparently nearly ready for release. I won't watch that one.",Machete Kills
93,Jonathon_Natsis,Machete kills it in this rip-roaring sequel.,8,21 May 2014,"Three years ago, we all learnt that Machete don't text. In the blasting, blistering sequel, Machete Kills, everyone's favourite renegade federale informs us that he don't tweet, fail or, apparently, do things by halves. Again teaming up with Mexploitation master Robert Rodriguez, unlikely leading man Denny Trejo – and an eclectic cast that reads like a guest list of Hollywood's most debaucherous house party – have created an inexplicably enjoyable summer romp; a film that plays by its own rules and never alienates the audience despite an increasingly ridiculous plot line.After earning his green card for his previous heroism, Machete is recruited by the US government to take down one of the world's most wanted criminal masterminds, Mendez the Madman (Demian Bichir). Along the way, he is ensnared by the seductive but sinister Madame Desdemona (Sofia Vergara), who blames Machete for the death of her daughter (Vanessa Hudgens) at the hands of Mendez's cartel. The plot thickens when the mysterious arms dealer Luther Voz (Mel Gibson) threatens to launch his piece de resistance into space. It's up to Machete to stop him, provided he can outrun the ruthless bounty hunter La Chameleon (Lady Gaga, Antonio Banderas, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Walton Goggins all contribute as the master of disguise).Yeah, there's quite a bit going on in this one. While some might argue – perhaps with good reason – that Rodriguez could've used someone on set to tell him ""no"" every once in a while, the end result is a rampantly good time buoyed by the intentional goofiness of each character. Lady Gaga holds her own in her feature film debut, Charlie Sheen/Carlos Estevez earns votes as a drinking, swearing, whoring, blackmailing President, and the rest of the big names ham it up as needed, with the only speedbump being Vergara's somewhat tiresome Austin Powers-inspired femme fatale, complete with dominatrix whip and standard issue nipple-guns. The star, however, might just be the lesser-known Bichir. Nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in 2011's A Better Life, he steals the show as a drug lord with a severe case of split personality; his jumpy and unpredictable demeanour making for big laughs when he shares the screen with the no- nonsense Trejo.Rodriguez has put himself in the best possible position as a filmmaker facing potential scrutiny here. Any moments of brilliant action or cracking dialogue (and there are plenty of them) can be chalked up to his talents, while cheesy character arcs and gaping plot holes (which aren't exactly lacking either) are overlooked because, well, that's just grindhouse. But put simply, Machete Kills just doesn't care, in the best possible way. It throws all conventions of typical action movie-making out, or rather, through, the window, and never fails to ensure pure, unadulterated fun is its top priority.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

And even though the movie has a great cast and is action packed it falls flat in some areas and is plain ridiculous in other areas.The premise of the movie is that Machete is tasked to go to Mexico and check out an ex-drug cartel member turned revolutionary with multiple personalities (one psychotic, the other revolutionary) who has threatened to launch a missile at the U.S.A. Plot twists and turns ensue and soon Machete and the revolutionary who has the detonator to the rocket attached to his heart are making their way back from Mexico to the U.S.A. Meanwhile they are being chased by anyone who wants a piece of the $ 20 million dollar bounty placed on their heads and by a group of prostitute assassins as well. Through the course of the movie we discover that there is an even bigger villain in the picture, an arms and space technology manufacturer called Voz who wants to create complete chaos and destruction on earth while he and the people chosen by him go to live on a space station and later re-claim the earth. He also has an army of physically enhanced human clones and futuristic weapons which he created by claiming that he sees the future and supposedly knows what will happen. Voz (played by Mel Gibson) is also the one who killed Machete's Partner at the beginning of the film and you know that there is some sort of payback coming. By the end of the movie we have something that looks like a mixed rip-off of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones mixed with a James Bond movie with machete madness added into the mix. Interestingly enough there is a James Bond Film starring Roger Moore where an evil industrialist wants to launch gas capsules from his space station whilst the ""perfect people"" he has chosen live on a space station. So I wonder where Robert Rodriguez got the idea.The acting overall is what you would expect it to be. Highly forced and made to look like an exploitation movie from the 1970's. Danny Trejo is Machete and plays the role well. He has a supporting cast consisting of amongst others: Mel Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Antonio Banderas, Sofia Vergara, Carlos Estavez (i.e Charlie Sheen), Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lady Gaga. Everyone brings something to the mix (mostly over the top), but I think that the acting as well as the action seems forced at most times. Overall I would give it around 5.5 to 6 out of 10. Not exceptional but watchable if you have nothing better to watch.",Machete Kills
96,JPfanatic93,Machete kicks more - but feels less bad- ass,6,17 November 2013,"Robert Rodriguez continues telling the strange and ever over-the-top chronicles of his delightfully violent character Machete (Danny Trejo), who once starred in a fake trailer attached to his original Grindhouse segment Planet Terror and suddenly embarked on a life of his own. Though no faux trailer for this second installment was ever attached to other similar themed films (maybe there just were none), Machete Kills itself opens with a trailer for the alleged third movie, the dubiously titled Machete Kills Again... In Space! It's both a stroke of genius – as this 'prevue' perfectly sets the tone for what's to come, as well as pokes fun to the whole B-movie style Rodriguez embraces so vigorously more aptly in two minutes than the following film does in two hours – but also rather frustrating, as we know exactly how the movie we're about to see ends and what characters survive to fight another day (in space, yes). As such, Machete Kills is largely rendered devoid of any large narrative surprises. As we'll find out soon enough, the film doesn't rely on story structure at all, as in this regard it's kind of a mess, bloated with characters and motivations, many which change over the course of the movie. We're just supposed to roll with it as we did in the case of the first film, but it's obvious the paying-homage-to-grindhouse-cinema is getting stale. This time, Machete is hired by the President of the USA (Charlie Sheen, humorously billed under his birth name Carlos Estevez and given an 'introducing' credit accordingly) to stop an arms dealer with a bad case of schizophrenia (Demian Bichir) from launching a nuclear assault upon Washington D.C. Why Machete cares about America at all, being an exploited Mexican alien and so forth, is only briefly addressed as we're not supposed to care to much for it is his simple duty to 'go kick some ass', and we like to see him do just that (we do!). Of course the situation is not nearly as simple as it seems and the bad guy's trail leads to an even bigger villain, a big shot industrialist named Voz (Mel Gibson) who harbors even deadlier threats to mankind's health. Along the road, Machete must dodge various well armed, colourful hit men and legions of mindless minions, survive plots by double agents and also make love to beautiful women from time to time. A lot to do in only two hours, and what's more, a lot of characters to introduce and successively kill off in new and interesting ways.Even more star studded than Machete's previous venture, this movie features appearances by an overly large score of popular actors including the likes of Jessica Alba, Amber Heard, Lady Gaga, Antonio Banderas, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Vanessa Hudgens. With so many celebrities present, it's obvious a lot of them don't get the screen time they deserve. Another, more serious result is that Trejo himself feels somewhat overwhelmed by it all (or maybe it's just his age, as he's pushing 70) and delivers a less than stellar performance than we're used to, not nearly exuberating the same type of invincibility and 'badassery' as he did before. Fortunately we still have the scantily clad tough girl Michelle Rodriguez (no relation), reprising her role as secret revolutionary Luz, to make up for Trejo's lack of bravura. In all other respects, Machete Kills is equally enjoyable as its predecessor, containing the maximum amount of scenes of idiotic ultraviolence, sweaty sensuality (though surprisingly no actual nudity this time) and a plethora of insanely funny genre self-referencing that have proved hallmarks of Rodriguez' grindhouse flicks. My favorite, apart from the opening trailer for Part 3, is the sex scene which out of the blue has the film stock distorted and blurred just when it got saucy, with an overlaying text asking us to put on our 3D-glasses. At least in terms of sheer simple fun Machete once again gives us what we expect, which does still make you want to see him kill again in space: like the trailer says, because 'it's all galactic and sh!t'.",Machete Kills
97,bravesfanc,Once is enough,4,12 January 2014,"The first ""Machete"" was great, I loved the movie and would highly recommend it. This sequel however, just couldn't capture the comedy and over the top moments it did in the first film. There are plenty of cameo's so to speak and it's an excellent cast. But it felt like they tried to top the first one and they failed.The opening is a trailer for ""Machete Kills Again...In Space"" and it's quite funny, little did I know that they tied this movie into that one. And frankly, I don't need to see another movie where Machete does these crazy, insane things that no human could possibly do. I understand that you don't take a movie like this seriously but at some point, it gets old.So as for the end, it doesn't get resolved. I don't know how serious they are about making another film or if it was just a big joke but I will probably skip it. I laughed a few times but it just didn't come close to the first and maybe my expectations were too high. It's a below average film that wasted some talent.",Machete Kills
98,rcolgan,"Some funny moments, but gets repetitive",5,9 August 2014,"Rodriguez's B movie, Mexploitation action hero returns. But honestly, this probably would have been better if it had existed only as a trailer. Whilst the first was fun and had some cool moments, Machete Kills just doesn't seem to add anything new. Instead it just does the same thing, just told in a less enjoyable way. This time Machete is sent by the President (played by Carlos Estevez (also known as Charlie Sheen)) to stop a nuclear threat that threatens to destroy the world. Thus begins an hour and a half killing spree where Machete must take on corrupt cops, assassins, prostitutes, Mexicans and crazy businessmen who want to get to space. The only memorable part of Machete Kills is the celebrity cameos. They're by far the best parts of the film with all of them being as ridiculous as the last. Most of them come from a hit-man who changes his face who is played by Walton Goggins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Antonio Banderas and Lady Gaga. They all hardly get any screen time and remain as over the top as they can in their short time on screen. But the best cameo is definitely Sheen as the President, who legalises pot, sleeps with 5 women and has a slogan of ""Winning was only the beginning"". It's just about as ludicrous as what would happen if he really did run for President. But other than these short cameos, there's not much to make this film worth watching. It seems to cut between nothing but exposition and Machete killing people. Whilst the films ugly cgi and over the top gore is funny at first, it gets old quick. There's only so many times that you can laugh at how bad the film looks. On top of this all the battle sequences are mostly either very basic sword fights or dull gun fights. Even Machete had some memorable moments such as attacking the limo or the priest with the shotgun. But here the fight scenes just blend into one another, especially when they cut to another random action sequence every 5 minutes On top of this the dialogue in the film is unpleasant with lines like ""I chewed my fathers balls off with my teeth!"" It ends up sounding more like a SciFy channel film like Sharknado. Whilst this is the intended joke of parodying the way these films were badly made, the film relies too much on the joke of deliberately sloppy filmmaking. At first it was a nice callback to the old grind-house movies. But he's now based 3 films around this joke (Planet Terror, Machete and Machete Kills) and at first it was funny. But now its become worn out, like an old stand up trying to relive his heyday. It can still be enjoyable at times, but after a while the films bad cgi and weak dialogue becomes too repetitive. Whilst the film teases a sequel in the films opening tease trailer, after this film it would seem better if they were to just let the franchise end at this point. Unless something new can be added it would be best to just let the franchise come to an end.",Machete Kills
99,MovieProductions,"Appreciated the effort, but still no payoff",4,12 October 2013,"Let's first get this out of the way: I am not biased at all in reviewing ""Machete Kills"". Number one, I loved Grindhouse and the first Machete. Two, I don't expect story/characters/acting from a movie called Machete Kills. And three, I am not downgrading the film because it ditched the editing/directing style of the first one. (And for other reasons people will label me as biased, I am completely fine with the actors in the film).With that being said, this is just not a fun movie. Of course it's not a good one. It's friggin' Machete. But you at least have to let your audience in on the good time. Oh I'm sure Lady Gaga, Sofia Vergara, and so forth had fun, but did we? While every review is going to spat out ""it's not fun"", I'll tell why it isn't. For starters, this movie cannot make up its mind. From the Machete 3 trailer up until the opening credits play out, Machete Kills is a good a** time. It feels like we're retreading the same ground, but not done in a way where it's boring. After that, it's like Adult Spy Kids... and you'd assume that's a good thing. So if this is a grindhouse movie about a Mexican vigilante, why are there gadgets that look like they've been left at 50 Cent's house? And what's up with all the iMacs and plasma screens. Okay, so put that aside, but visually, this movie doesn't make sense either. The color palette is way too sharp for you to forget this isn't really a grindhouse movie. Whereas the first established a more gritty feel, this one is just way too clean. Okay so put aside the technical aspects, the actors are actually not very good at acting in already purposely sh*tty roles (I'm not insulting the so-bad-it's-good genre, noticed I said ""purposely""). Machete as always delivers as well as Luz, but Jessica Alba looks bored here (without going into spoilers, I understand she can only do so much but still). Sofia Vergara just seems awkward playing an antagonist and Lady Gaga and Alexis Vega (I'm sorry if I butchered this) are wasted. Way too many cameos from people we don't care about, or if we do, they're not put to good use. And lastly, the kills. They cut-away so fast and the effects are so bad with the CGI, it's like I was watching Final Destination 4. Grindhouse/Machete had way better effects to them and those aimed to the same as this movie. There is no excuse to have your blood effects look this bad. Well... what did I like about this movie? When the dialogue wasn't cringe-worthy (again I get it's not supposed to be a No Country for Old Men script, but the first had its fair share of humor), some of the stuff is pretty good. Especially from Michelle Rodriguez. Also, the Machete 3 trailer sets it up perfectly and the opening attack was very well done. And I liked more of the Machete 3 footage at the end. I really really REALLY wanted to like Machete Kills. From its first trailer until premiere day, I had my wallet ready but I was just not satisfied, and Robert Rodriguez KILLS the genre. He co- directed the amazing Sin City (I know it's not an exploitation flick, but I meant he kills the adult genre), he directed the awesome Planet Terror, and he directed (of course) Machete. What happened? Does this mean that Spy Kids 5 will be awesome? (considering Rodriguez' Spy Kids sequels are usually his worst material). I don't think I'll venture off to see Machete 3, even with its cool trailer unless the reviews are as good as the first, but for now, I sadly will have to say, Machete Kills is one of 2013's most disappointing sequels. On the bright side, Lady Gaga shines as an actress! No seriously, she steals the scenes she's in. Hopefully she gets more work in the future.",Machete Kills
100,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,4,20 October 2013,"The story behind Machete Kills started in 2007 with Quentin Tarantino's/Robert Rodriguez's exploitation double-feature Grindhouse. Before each segment, Planet Terror and Death Proof, trailers for fake movies were shown. One of these trailers was for a movie called Machete, which expanded into a feature film in 2010. The full length movie Machete was an enjoyable and fun experience, with a great and original concept behind it. However, the sequel, Machete Kills, is far from its predecessor and it's a very disappointing movie - to say the least.The movie opens with Machete (Danny Trejo) and Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) investigating an illegal weapon trade between the US army and the cartel. Predictably, a slaughter ensues and Sartana is killed by some masked men who enter the scene. Machete survives the shoot out and is eventually hired by the president of the US (Charlie Sheen, credited by his real name Carlos Estévez) to go to Mexico to find a terrorist who threatens to launch a missile at Washington D.C. Machete finds this crazy terrorist guy, whose name is Mendez (Demian Bichir), and he tries to bring him to the US while a bunch of mercenaries chase them and try to kill them to collect the bounty that's been put on their heads.There are several ways in which you can create a comedy movie. One of them is creating a big budget, intentionally trash/grindhouse/so-bad-it's-good movie. With movies like Planet Terror and Machete, Robert Rodriguez mastered this trade. Of course, he had incorporated some of these comic elements in his earlier movies too, but Planet Terror and Machete are prime examples of this genre of comedy. The problem is that these two movies are very recent, and I get the feeling that Rodriguez wasted all of his original comic ideas creating them. And that isn't a shame. It's never a shame to run out of original ideas after a few great movies. However, it is a shame to create such a bad movie like Machete Kills. Like I said, I think Rodriguez ran out of all of his grindhouse ideas after making his previous movies, and that is fine, but Machete Kills offers nothing but predictable, uninspiring and boring grindhouse jokes. Rodriguez already created two grindhouse movies, and if he can't come up with more original and quality ideas for more grindhouse comedies anymore, he should have written Machete Kills as a slightly different kind of comedy (let's say, a comedy revolving around a funny premise or funny character) that has a grindhouse feel to it, instead of forcing another pure grindhouse comedy. Machete Kills isn't funny and since its only purpose is to be funny, it fails miserably. Sure, you will laugh here and there, but Machete Kills is more of a boring, tedious movie than an 'enjoyable fun experience' like its predecessor.The problem of Machete Kills, besides the bad jokes, is the bad writing overall. I know a movie like this is supposed to have a ludicrous story and undeveloped, clichéd characters, but if I'm not laughing at the jokes, the movie should entertain me in some other way. Once again, I have nothing against inane, silly plots - if they are told in an interesting, engaging, original way. But Machete Kills' dull, tiresome story and many pointless cameos were just too much of a snooze fest for me. The Machete franchise is getting another sequel - Machete Kills Again - which was announced and green lit during the period of release of the first movie. Hopefully, the bad critical reception of Machete Kills will discourage Rodriguez from making another Machete movie. It's a shame that Machete Kills turned out the way it did since I had big hopes for it, but now I can only acknowledge it as one of this year's biggest movie disappointments.Rating: 4/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",Machete Kills
101,CowherPowerForever,A Worthy Sequel,7,12 October 2013,"In 2010 Machete finally came to the big screen and in 2013 Machete gets a sequel that is overall better than the first film.The storyline in this film feels better than the first Machete and works better because of all the great acting in it. Sure Danny Trejo is not a great actor but costars like Mel Gibson, Amber Heard, Carlos Estevez, Antonio Banderas, and Cuba Gooding Jr. really make this movie an improvement over the last movie. The movie drags in spots and brings the film down that and this is almost basically the same movie as Machete but with a better cast and slightly better story.Director Robert Rodriguez is back in this film and better than ever. The action and violence is completely over the top just the way I like it. Sure you could say that the violence is over the top but it fits the film so well. Just as it did in the last movie. Stepping up the casting in this film also helped as you can tell. The actors get along much better on screen. Mel Gibson is truly amazing in this film and it is good to see him on the big screen again. The movie feels cheesy in some of the kills as it should. This is suppose to be a grindhouse type of film and Machete Kills fits that mold. Rodriguez handles the film very well and the scenes are shot amazingly for the type of film he set out to make here.Having enjoyed Machete in 2010 I must say this film is just above the first movie as the acting is so much better with the help of Mel Gibson. While some may not find it worthy of spending ten dollars, if you are a fan of this type of film then it is well worth the charge. With great action and some very good acting you will leave the theater wanting to see this movie again and again.",Machete Kills
102,voyou-703-655350,Hilarious,7,19 November 2013,"A bit of background first: I didn't enjoy Grindhouse, but loved its Machete trailer and hoped for the movie to be made. Luckily, I wasn't the only one, and the movie came out. I enjoyed it, but only mildly, which was disappointing. Also, I am biased when it comes to Danny Trejo. I give a shot to whatever he is in. I just enjoy the man, although he has always been better in a supporting cast than as a lead. Still, I don't give rating stars easily, and certainly won't praise a movie just for casting someone I like.Now with Machete Kills. Well, it's better than its predecessor. Not perfect (yet?), not quite what it aspires to be, but much closer. It is very difficult to make chaos evenly entertaining for two hours; that may explain why I felt like some scenes didn't hit their mark. Which don't really matter because after the end credits, I was still laughing my tears off.I'll start with the end, and a bit more background: I boycotted Mr Tarentino for years after Kill Bill, for which I paid to see Michael Madsen, only to see an ugly blonde skeleton dressed like HK's legendariest hero in an unfinished story. Had I met Mr T. shortly afterwards (the Quentin one, not that big strong guy from the A-Team), I would have harmlessly kicked his sitting organ to express my disapproving of being conned.Machete Kills ends on a cliffhanger. An excellent one, clever, hilarious. And it doesn't even matter if the space sequel is made or not, because it stands on its own as a perfect ending.You see, you won't watch Machete Kills for its suspenseful plot, because anything can happen. No laws of physics, biology or men apply here, only the laws of cinema and comics, in particular superhero comics. One of the classics, ignored in most superhero films, is put to good use here: Death is anything but permanent. Hey, after a while, I even expected Cheech Marin to make a come-back.Machete Kills is a very good parody. It's an homage, not a mockery. To me, it parodies mostly James Bond from the Roger Moore's era, in which each stunt was more incredible and unbelievable than the previous one. It cleverly parallels Star Wars as well. Borrows from the director's own movies don't work so well, such as the crotch-gun from Tom Savini's character Sex Machine in From Disk Till Dawn. I obviously missed a lot of references and jokes, and you'll get more if, unlike me, you are Mexican or from the USA.The casting is excellent, except for the Lady Gaga girl but her fan base will hopefully be good for business. Mr Trejo's average oratory skills are covered by having the villains do most of the talking, while Machete sometimes grunts the shortest and cheesiest one-liners at the 3rd person. And it works great.I'm getting too long. I won't develop on the flaws. Machete Kills is chaotic, completely mad, very funny and has many tremendously entertaining moments.",Machete Kills
103,The_moan_of_all_moans,Machete don't act.,2,13 October 2013,"If you've seen the first film, then you know what's coming in the sequel. The bizarre characters, ludicrous events, mundane acting. But despite that it works...well for the first film it did. Something about an old Mexican who lacks emotion and is an indestructible killing machine just works. But for the sequel, instead of giving the fans something new, they basically rehash everything. Machete talking about him self in the third person every 10 minutes becomes boring. And even in a film like this you would think that acting would maybe be a priority...But Charlie Sheen is (yet again) a farce and shadow of his former comedy self. We get it Charlie; you're a degenerate; a first class moron who has taken all the luxuries in life and snorted them up your nose. We get it...yayyyy, you're a low life...yayyy. But the fact you are now infamous, doesn't give you the ability to act; you are the Miley Cyrus of acting. Couldn't they find someone else, give someone else a platform.Now from the junkie woman beater to the deteriorating alcoholic Mel Gibson (yes..the same Mel Gibson who was in Lethal Weapon).A once extremely talented actor who drank his career away is now stuck with trying to make a name for himself with films which make fun of themselves. Coincidentally he does seem drunk throughout his part in the film. Yet somehow he is easily the most entertaining character. Wouldn't be hard considering they have Cuba Gooding Jnr and Antonio Banderas star for probably 3 minutes each. And just when you think it couldn't get any worse.....enter Lady Gaga. What is it with singers wanting to star in films? It is just pure greed; greed for more money,for more acceptance, for more screen time. Go away; go back to the stage and dress up in meat. You can't act Gaga. And with her introduction i just couldn't help but draw the comparison with the recent Scary Movies films. A franchise which is dying...in fact it died a long time ago. Machete was unique in ways, Machete Kills fails miserably and expect Machete Kills again..In Space to be along the lines of Scary Movie 5 in space...i know horrifying.",Machete Kills
104,s_campanale,"Machete, Mexico, Mel, Madmen, Moonraker, Guns, Gaga and G.I Joe: Two hours trapped in the disturbed mind of Robert Rodriguez",6,12 October 2013,"Machete was famously created as one of a host of fake old time movie trailers in Rodriguez & Tarantino's ground breaking but ill-fated ""Grindhouse"" project. The set up was pretty simple, Super cool, super tough Danny Trejo was a top Mexican agent wronged by the cartels and his own people, who went out on a bloody orgy of revenge. How could you go wrong with as generic & yet bountiful a premise as that? Well Rodriguez has now managed it twice.With the first ""Machete"" in 2011, Rodriguez somehow decided to make an 80% straight political diatribe which was as ill-informed and logically gapped as it was dull and poorly made (the worst of its sins) that squandered Trejo and the stellar cast around him. This time the student politics have been left largely behind, and in their place is a bizarre, confused kaleidoscope of ideas, mostly stolen outright from other franchises, that ultimately ends up looking like a 2 hour version of the finale of Ang Lee's ""Hulk""!It starts off pretty well with Machete losing his partner from the 1st movie, agent Sartana (Jessica Alba) at the hands of a masked villain, then being called up for action by the US president, played by Charlie Sheen under his actual Hispanic birth name Carlos Estevez. His mission is to stop a crazed Mexican revolutionary, Mendez (Demian Bichir) who suffers from multiple personalities and is aiming a nuclear missile at Washington in order to obtain US help to clean up Mexico's endemic corruption. Along the way he crosses swords with psychotic man hating madam Desdemona (Sofia Vergara) & her team of armed hookers, ""El Cameleon"", an assassin who uses Mission Impossible style masks to assume many shapes (all played by name actors) and ""Miss San Antonio"" (Amber Heard) a CIA agent posing as a beauty queen with divided loyalties, Turns out Mendez has the bombs trigger attached to his heart ""Spawn"" style with the clock counting down to 45 hours. After an increasingly confused series of chases and fights he ends up facing off against Mendez backer and real villain, arms dealer Luther Voz (Mel Gibson) a clairvoyant who plans to destroy the world with Mendez's bomb, linked as it is to others around the globe, so as to be able to repopulate it with a new better race from the secret space station he's built in the heavens and will reach with his new shuttle craft. He, and his ""Jaws"" like henchman Zaror (Marko Zaror) try to convince Machete to join him, but instead he seeks the aid of his old ally, revolutionary Luz (Michelle Rodriguez) & her network, who launch a raid on Voz's pre- launch party. Things get even more confused at that point, with numerous tedious face offs and Voz becoming a sort of Destro-Cobra commander hybrid, with everything ending on a cliffhanger!Yes! The film is a 2 parter, the scratchy 70s style trailer for part 2, entitled ""Machete Kills again..in Space"" bookends the film. If it ever gets made we will see. (And whether we will even WANT to watch it remains another matter!)Trejo is good in the role, even though age is catching him up and actual hand to hand action scenes are fairly rare. Most of the violence consists of endless chases and shoot outs that are either poorly shot & co-ordinated on purpose as a ""trash"" tribute or actually simply poorly shot & co-ordinated. All the other actors are fine, though its frustrating to watch them try to create something in the utter void that this film is. As the above precis suggests, the film is unfocused, has both too much plot and hardly any narrative, and worse drags and drags, something a good fun movie should never do. It purports to be a light hearted action comedy pastiche, but like the original it doesn't feel like one. It is filled with a weird nastiness, a sort of nightmarish unpleasantness that originates not from the story but from the one behind the camera. It doesn't feel like a fun film, and it's attempts at knowing winking humour Austin Powers style are D.O.A,The film also steals openly from other sources, mainly the 007 series, Voz's plot is ""Moonraker""'s and he is Drax, but with elements of Stromberg and even Dr Kananga (the clairvoyance being his own not Solitaires) As if that wasn't enough, he then rips off ""G.I Joe Rise of Cobra""'s ending with Voz becoming a sort of Cobra Commander-Destro hybrid in exactly the same way. ""Star Wars"" iconography is also acquired under the excuse that Voz is a ""Star Wars nut"". The bomb trigger in the heart has been used before in ""Escape from LA"", ""Spawn"" & others too, while the secret border tunnel hails from ""Fast N' Furious"".Following a pattern of cinematic self immolation starting with ""Once upon a time in Mexico"" from the previously gifted Rodriguez (sole exceptions being kiddie friendly ""Spy Kids"" series and ""Sin City"" which was mostly Frank Miller's gig anyway) it's hard to know what we are meant to make of this production. And although he and Tarantino started the welcome ""Grindhouse"" revival bandwagon, their own efforts have been the least successful artistically. Others, like Michael Jai White's ""Black Dynamite"", Will Ferrell's ""La Casa de Mi Padre"", RZA's ""The Man with the Iron Fist"" and Wingard & Barratt's ""You're next"" all managed to recreate the retro Grindhouse experience more successfully and more honestly.Still, it could be enjoyed as a reasonable Saturday night film if you don't mind it's multiple faults, and it does have the distinction of being the most unique film around at the moment!",Machete Kills
105,ernesti,The new dimension of trash films is here.,3,18 February 2016,"Machete Kills must be one of the most violent films that i've ever seen but actually it's also so light to watch that it makes me wonder if the director has ever got hang of the idea of tension building. There's none of it. It's like watching a violent scene after another that follows shortly without any tension, just cartoon-like characters making tired jokes and that's about it. Just about everyone gets killed, but Machete somehow manages to get out alive.I did find several scenes funny but that's no good if the idea wasn't used further. This movie just rushes hastily from one idea to another and it's perfect for those who can't concentrate while watching a film.Well, honestly this movie is the new dimension of trash and yet many people will enjoy it. It's still watchable and still it's one of the dumbest and lightest violent film there is. It's a Tarantino film without the character development and coherence. It's a mess.

It was over the top and campy and full of violence and unrealistic action sequences but that's what the movie is about so it doesn't disappoint. Vergara added spice to the film and Estevez made a valiant come back. I like that he switched to his birth name for the film.There were countless cameos and most were splendid. The Camaleón was a great addition but I could have done without Lady Gaga and Cuba Gooding Jr. I just didn't think they added anything to the movie. My favorite part of the movie has to be the armored El Camino. I mean what would a movie filled with stereotypes about illegal Mexicans be without an El Camino?

But this is one absolutely eye-popping balls out insane movie I've ever seen, it's gloriously bloody and big on laughs just like the first movie, although this sequel excels in terms of introducing new characters, the relentless killing of keys characters and the hotness of women. Sofia Vergara is wonderful as Desdemona, a ""man-eater"" as she puts it who goes on a revenge rampage alongside the heavenly sexy Alexa Vega starring as Killjoy, after one of their own is killed. I will never look at Modern's Family Vergara the same way again after watching this movie but that's a good thing, as she puts on her Double D-plated guns and her rocket firing penis-pistol and screams after Machete. I thought Lady Gaga's debut was excellent, she comes across as a genuinely unstable killer, and her acting style is very Tarantino and I hope she has future roles cause she certainly kicked ass and convinced. The gore and intestinal removal madness is back and as fun as ever, Machete's inventive kills include helicopter blade slashing, literal turning bodies inside out and so much more madness, you won't believe your eyes. The trailer for ""Machete Kills Again...In Space"" is pure genius, echoing days of MoonRaker alongside many Star Wars references, but throwing in gun toting women just for eye candy. Michelle Rodriguez makes a welcome return and loses her second eye but still fights for Mexico. Amber Heard delivers one of her career best as Miss San Antonio, a feisty and full-on agent working with Machete, but the best moment for Heard is the standoff between her and Rodriguez, it's a violent and bone crunching climax that hits hard. Mel Gibson absolutely kills it as Voz, it's his funniest role and the way he is all playful as the antagonist is so funny against the backdrop of bone- splattering violence. Then there's Carlos Estevez, or as most of you know as Charlie Sheen, using his real name as President RathCock, a foul-mouth say it as it is leader who hires Machete, Sheen is as entertaining as ever, and no one could've played this comedic part any better. Would I watch it again? Absolutely, this movie is a blast thanks to Robert Rodriguez' amazing style and solid direction, the unbelievable cast all of whom are perfect and the nutty nature that takes place from the cartoonish-ly bloody violence, Gaga's awesome debut, super sexy women (especially Vergara and Vega) and the relentless onslaught of hilarious gags.",Machete Kills
109,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Machete Kills,6,20 December 2013,"Every new additional reiteration of Machete is becoming less funnier than its predecessor. Machete was funny when it was first a trailer in Grindhouse. It was mildly amusing when it was made into a feature film. The sequel, Machete Kills, is now just a bland joke that has been worn out by its many retellings. Robert Rodriguez, the joke teller, can't seem to get enough of his own joke. Furthermore, he doesn't seem to care how much we like the joke at all.This film went right through me. As soon as it was finished, it was forgotten. Danny Trejo is an unique on screen presence and I'm glad he is still working at age 69. Trejo has shown range in many of his supporting roles. Unfortunately, Rodriguez uses Trejo blandly as the film's straight man, having react deadpan to the supporting cast of crazy cartoon characters surrounding him. Much of the film's gags feel cheap, and it has nothing to do with b-movie irony. The most noteworthy example being the El Chameleón character, an assassin who is a literal shapeshifter, is a cheap excuse to open up guest star spots to help market the film. See? This all seems funnier to Robert Rodriguez than it is to the audience.Robert Rodriguez claims to like his characters, and proceeds to populate his film with a cast of supporting characters that are on the surface visually interesting, but doesn't do anything with them. It's as if Rodriguez is perpetually trying to sculpt the perfect action icon, but never delivers the pathos to fully sell the character. Instead, the characters are all handled in a throwaway fashion, tossed aside once their iconography is fully formed.The saving grace of Machete Kills is Mel Gibson, who really devotes himself to the role, milking his dialogue and sells his Bond villain-like character as if he were playing Macbeth. Gibson's performance matches with the film's ridiculous tone, but adds that missing pathos that Rodriguez is unable to provide, making every other actor slapdash by comparison. But when Gibson's Luther Voz claimed to be a Star Wars fan who decorates his evil fortress with Star Wars memorabilia, I gave myself a light face palm. Evoking Star Wars as a source of humor is just about the lamest joke in the book.That's how this film slashes itself (pun intended). It is lazy and half-assed; it doesn't know what to do with its own talent and has expended all of its irony. It's sad to see Robert Rodriguez fall to this level. He is a very capable and multi-talented filmmaker who can shoot, score and edit, but maybe he just shouldn't write his own scripts. I do not care about the upcoming Machete Kills Again... In Space. Please wow me with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.",Machete Kills
110,ikrani,Just When I Thought The Art Had Died Out...,8,10 March 2014,"The making of bad films is a lost art. Not since the 1990s has a filmmaker been able to go ""Fack reality"" and make something as bombastically insane as ""Street Fighter"" or ""Judge Dredd"" (those movies are awesome, by the way). Every film these days wants to take itself seriously or tries to be hammy but falls flat when it can't quite let go of its ego.Enter Robert Rodriguez: possibly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Why? Because, unlike Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg or Michael Bay, Rodriguez wants to do nothing more than do what movies originally did: strip away our suspension of disbelief and allow us into their world of unbelievably fake stuff.And BOY is this movie fake. This wasn't even a movie at first; it started off as a fake trailer to its predecessor, ""Machete"", which I haven't seen but I hear is a bit more grounded in reality than this film. I guess ""Machete Kills"" thought its prequel made far too much sense and decided to take off on a jet airliner made of bullets, blood and testosterone.Danny Trejo turns in the same tough-guy act that he always turns in, made all the more enjoyable by all the craziness that's going on around him. Michelle Rodriguez is more or less the same clichéd action hero she always is, and Sofia Vergara is a prostitute with a few sexualized weapons lifted from Rodriguez's vampire grindhouse, ""From Dusk Til Dawn"". The three actors make the Chameleon a fun character despite Lady Gaga's interference. And Mel Gibson is the villain is PERFECT.There's a certain madness required to enjoy this film. If your not willing to let go of your linear thoughts and embrace the cartoonishly violent nature of this masterpiece of bad cinema, then you probably won't enjoy it.And if they don't deliver that sequel they promised me as I was leaving the theater, I'm gonna be mighty upset.",Machete Kills
111,cafesmitty,"Love the first one, I wanted to like this, but....",4,12 October 2013,"Let me start off by saying love love love the first Machete. I can watch it anytime... This one, not so much. Robert Rodriquez swung for the fences with this one and it missed. Some people will never ever say anything bad about the guy and some will genuinely like it, but to be honest.. it just didn't have that X factor the first Machete did. This time around Machete is more like a super hero. He is sent on a mission to Mexico by the President (excellent choice of casting Charlie Sheen, using his birth name of Carlos Esteves). But other than that, (and of course Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriquez), the rest of the cast just didn't fit. The schizo Mexican revolutionary didn't fit, Cuba was completely out of place, wasn't really feeling Lady Gaga or Amber Heard (even though she is gorgeous) and the gorgeous Sophia Vegara was just a little too manic. But it really wasn't that.. the film just was kind of flat, even the action scenes weren't clicking. Maybe because they gave away too much in the previews. Maybe its because they made Machete inhuman.. All I know is that when I was in the theater, 3 people around me fell asleep and 4 people walked out a hour after the film started... AND it wasn't that many people in the theater. Gosh I wanted it to be so much better.. This is a rental, at best",Machete Kills
112,pressboard,The Best So Far - Great!,8,14 October 2013,"Considering that this is a sequel to an original that was inspired by a fake trailer, Rodriquez is a genius. He maintains the grindhouse feel of the first movie with even more over-the-top blood and gore and outrageously funny scenes - bravo! There are so many movies that cannot successfully deliver a straight story and acting much less a spoof of a spoof. There is a trailer at the end of Machete Kills for a sequel and I will definitely not miss it. It helps that I watched these low-budget, spliced to death movies, all through the 70's, 80's and Rodriquez, along with Tarantino have their finger on the spurting pulse of these sub-genre, cult classics. They are probably the only two directors who can successfully recreate this type of filmmaking. The actors definitely embrace their raw characters and have fun with them. I really recommend this to anyone who feels adventuresome in their movie preferences or is a fan of Robert Rodriquez or Quentin Tarantino.",Machete Kills
113,Mischief810,Move over Quentin Tarantino,9,13 March 2015,"Rodriguez is the new dog on the porch. Tarantino probably saw Machete and Machete Kills, slapped his forehead and muttered to himself: ""Darn. Why didn't I think of that?"" Okay, I know that they worked together on the Grindhouse project, and I'm pretty sure that there are some Tarantino fingerprints on the Machete franchise, but Machete is Rodriguez' coming out party, and boy... does he throw a party!This film has everything Tarantino fans would love: Impossible storyline, star-studded cast, gratuitous violence, fast pace, action scene after action scene, sexy babes, a badass beyond belief, so forth and so on.It's so silly as to be marvelously entertaining and the opening scene lets you know what you're in for.There aren't many people who could cast Charlie Sheen as the President of the United States. Rodriguez does so. There aren't many people who could cast Mel Gibson as a nasty bad guy. Rodriguez does that, too. Throw in heavyweights like Lady Gaga, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Antonio Banderas, mix it with a crazy, twisting plot and you have a flick on the order of magnitude of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.This is a movie destined for cult classic status. It's best enjoyed on a Guys Night In setting, with lots of beer and the largest screen you can watch it on. It's not a serious film, but it wasn't intended as one.It's intended as an entertaining, almost comedic action yarn and it achieves its objectives very well.9/10",Machete Kills
114,impendingdd,I hate to give Trejo a bad grade,1,22 March 2020,"Danny Trejo deserves better than this. The purposely bad B-movie acting is a little too forced to enjoy. I'll tell you one thing though, I can't wait for Machete Kills Again!.... In SPACE! (If it ever happens). I've read that if Rodriguez doesn't make it happen, Trejo is willing to take the job up for himself. Which would be interesting. Perhaps he'll make it a little less corny. I enjoyed the first Machete more.",Machete Kills
115,darthsitkur,better than the first film and ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!!!!!!!!!,10,4 February 2014,"I bought this off of iTunes and I must say, this is the goriest, the bloodiest, and the most insane movie I've ever watched lol, it is so off the charts gory that it makes hansel and gretel: witch hunters look tame, and also, machete 2 is better than the first film, it has more action and more blood, guts, and gore, and the theme song is the best theme song I've ever heard. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor must've been involved with this movie since it was so insane and over the top lol, overall, if you're a big Robert Rodriguez fan like I am, you'll love this movie, if you loved the first machete, you'll love this, if you love tons of intense crazy action, you'll love this, if you love tons of insane gore, you'll love this, and if you think Robert Rodriguez is the best director ever, then you kick ass lol",Machete Kills
116,d-millhoff,My favorite Danny Trejo movie.,10,9 February 2018,"Very few people can pull off making a deliberately-bad movie. It usually results in a ho-hum mess like a Killer Tomatoes sequel, or an insult like Two Idiots go to Hollywood. Robert Rodriguez is the rare exception. His half of the Grindhouse double-feature, Planet terror, was a delightful hodgepodge of hammy direction and acting, cheap special effects, over-the-top crazy violence, and grunged-up distressing to make the movie look like it's been played for years in third-run moviehouses with sticky floors and moist, smelly seats.Machete was a spinoff based on a fake commercial that, with hollywood's greatest septuagenarian badass Danny Trejo was just too good - and bad - not to follow through with a real movie.And the spinoff's sequel, Machete Kills, is even more batsh*t-bonkers crazy!Hilarious, campy, and riddled with cameos, you can just tell that everyone had a great time making this movie.I'm looking forward to the (hopefull for real) Machete Kills In Space.",Machete Kills
117,d-millhoff,A perfect movie...,10,3 December 2019,"Machete Kills is Robert Rodriguez's finest film to date.Gratuitously, hilariously violent, insane, intentionally-grungy, sillly as all hell, and FUN!.Each and every meticulous flaw is perfectly executed as gorgeously Danny Trejo plays Danny Trejo like nobody else can in the role he was born to play.Looking forward to Machete Kills Again In Space.",Machete Kills
118,radmanart,Machete Kills More Make Believe Than Make Believe,10,1 March 2014,"I was proud to have watched the first Machete movie; as I am to watch any Robert Rodriguez movie. You have to be careful who you share this with now a days, of course. I was at work one morning at the local burger place about 4 years ago and said to burger cook; I loved the new Robert Rodriguez movie. I thought because he was from Mexico and seemed like a open minded person, he would agree. He got mad at me and gave me a speech about how bad Robert Rodriguez movies are for children. Yeah, that is why it is rated R; to keep kids from watching it. I feel the same way about Quentin Tarantino movies. There are not enough great R rated movies being made. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez make movies for mom and dad only and not the kids and mom and dad; and this is a art verses a sell out. I do love the comic superhero movies though and Black Jack , Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller comedies though. Of course I am not one of those that believes people who believes when someone watches a movie or plays a video game; they then go break the law. This way of thinking is closed minded and mentally unstable. So let us tip our hat to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez and give them the respect they deserve for making our adult movie viewing lives that much better.Machete Kills like the first Machete movie contains many great messages mixed in a subtle way. Quentin Tarantino does the same thing; so lets stand proud as fans of these great artists.",Machete Kills
119,ActionFan-Reviews,Should of went straight to DVD..,3,16 November 2013,"Danny Trejo even said himself this movie has ""blood,bullets and babes"". Which is true but it doesn't make it a good movie.I wanted to like it and my expectations were low for a movie like this.After reading the reviews I wanted to see how it was for myself. Machete Kills is good for the cast,Trejo playing this bad ass character he's perfect for and Alexa Vega & the other babes. I know these movies are supposed to be over the top and the story not as important as the action But the movie is barely watchable due to the absolutely ridiculous plot and slow pace. Overall, the 1st one is better, at least it has a decent story that makes the movie watchable and some memorable/funny moments.If you liked over the top grind house movies like ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" this is for you, but anyone else this movie is a bore and a waste of time.3/10",Machete Kills

Alexa Vega as ""BARBARELLA"" anyone?",8,31 March 2014,"OK I'm probably one of the minority here in that I think this tops ""Machete"" and that's probably because i'm a huge fan of 007 and Sci-Fi Fantasy movies.The first Machete to me was a little disappointing...Danny was awesome of course (a role he was made for) but the rest of that cast (except for Michelle Rodriguez and Robert DeNiro) disappointed a little.This is far far better & features a much more fun cast and is about as Over The Top as a movie can get, it's just crazy nuts!!! Cast list includes Danny, Michelle & Jessica Alba from the previous film but includes some great additions in the form of...Mel Gibson as Voz (Great to see him back on fun form) Amber Heard as Miss San Antonio (Wow she's terrific) ALEXA VEGA as Killjoy (My My has she grown up from the SPY KIDS Films, Mr Rodriguez was rumoured to be making ""BARBARELLA"" years ago & she would be perfect in the role, I wonder if we'll get a fun spoof in ""MACHETE KILLS in SPACE!"" with her doing the infamous opening striptease from that film, she's now 26 and Awesome!) Demian Bichir as Mendez (makes the film a joy to watch)Charlie Sheen as Mr President (Well you can't help but smile) Sofia Vergara (Wowzzer a sexy lady & I love the nod to the Ursula Andress film ""The 7th Victim with the best Bra EVER!!!) And then we get Lady Gaga (not a fan but surprisingly good), Antonio Banderas (Always good & was an Awesome ZORRO) and Cuba Gooding Jr (who I agree with others looked out of place but I guess that was the point)Add in a fun cameo or two including Vanessa Hudgens and we have a super cast.It's James Bond on acid and I LOVE THAT...some similarities to Moonraker the craziest ever Bond (but God Bless Cubby Broccolli for making it and that 007 outing made a ton of money on the back of the Star Wars film) Crazy mad man & inventor (Gibson) tries to destroy the world and take a group of people to his space station, it's a guys film, no apologies for that...with ray guns, exploding helicopters, fun rides, motorboat chases and fun quips and little winks to the audience.DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY...Get the beers in and you should enjoy it, language is a little salty & adult but this is Grindhouse stuff, surprisingly no nudity but Alexa is a little cheeky.PRAYING the 3rd Film gets made as it looks like the BEST of the Lot. ""Machete Kills...in Space"" should be a whole lot fun if ever made, so many fun moments could be made & the trailer at the beginning and fun ending promises this and riding on the new Star Wars films coat tails who knows perhaps it could be the biggest grossing of all the 'Machete' films.Michelle Rodriguez's outfit in that coming film (Black netting) LOOKS AMAZING!!! and let's hope Mr Robert Rodriguez gets to make that new updated ""BARBARELLA"" with ALEXA VEGA in the role...any takers? If not then a nice spoof scene in this 3rd film would be fun! ALL in ALL this was WONDERFULLY over-the-top Entertainment and Thanks go to the fun cast for the OTT performances!

121,britishdominion,"Grindhouse ""Machete"" Sequel Has Fun Villains, Overlong Plot",6,16 October 2013,"Undoubtedly, MACHETE KILLS is the one movie in theatres this past weekend that you may have missed while standing in line for artier-fare like GRAVITY or CAPTAIN PHILLIPS. With a title MACHETE KILLS, there's not a lot of room for subtlety, exploration of the human spirit or a desperate pursuit for the elusive Oscar statuette. If anything, the picture's title sounds less like a movie made for serious movie season and more like an obvious safety warning. I liked the first MACHETE movie enough. In fact, I liked it even more as a two-and-a-half minute fake trailer in GRINDHOUSE, so based on that, the rest of the 90 or so minutes of the first film ticked-off all that trailer's big moments with a large dose of in-joke silliness. Heavy on the gore and big movie stars like Robert DeNiro winking back at you from the big screen, it all worked.So, just as promised at the end of the first picture, Machete (Danny Trejo) is back for more in MACHETE KILLS. It's another cinematic bucket from the 70's exploitation picture tribute well that has treated both director Robert Rodriguez and his buddy in B's Quentin Tarantino extremely generously. Far be it for me to detail the overly-arch plot, because this one basically takes the illegal-alien Machete and turns him into a secret agent superman throwing him into lots of fights where he gets to use his machete and gets to blow stuff up.The bad news is that most of the silly, cheap fun that propelled the first MACHETE picture is slowly drained from the sequel. It feels like this new film is trying too hard this time out. The movie works in fits and starts - funny in places, even exciting - then it seems to labour for long stretches to keep its compendium of camp, gore and needlessly- extraneous plot in the audience's interest. At 107 minutes, the picture wanders for much longer than would have ever been permitted in the old 1970s drive-in movie days. Where were the ""Reel Missing"" cards that Rodriguez ingeniously deployed in his other B-picture tributes to paint himself out of a corner and keep the plot turning? Could have used a few of them here to get this sucker down to a Grindhouse-friendly 82 minutes.The good news here is the villains. Oscar-nominee Demian Beschir as the demented cartel warlord Mendez is incredible - he steals every scene he's in with his crazy-eyed energy and odd line-readings. He makes his character less a plot device and more a kinetic cartoon-y counterpoint to the stoic, mono-syllabic Machete. The other nice get is Mel Gibson as a Star Wars-obsessed aerospace magnate. Both look like they are having a lot of fun, and are so much better that the film that surrounds them - even if that film is supposed to be intentionally bad.SPOILER ALERT: the third entry of the MACHETE series is actually teased at the very beginning of this film - as a trailer. The concept is loony and knowing: playing like a 'real' film franchise whose creators are so bankrupt of plot ideas that they stick their main character in outer space. It has goofy energy in a two minute burst, and a great BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS/STARCRASH vibe. Perhaps it would be best to leave MACHETE right there.",Machete Kills

Probably friends and family of some of the actors, extras and of the crews?It's not funny, it's not tongue in cheek, it's not a parody, it's not a comedy. They have reached the absolute lower levels of abysmal.I have seen many bad movies and usually one can laugh because they are so bad. Some are so bad that they have become cult movies. This mess is much too awful to be laughed at.The plot ... what plot? Enough said.Were all these otherwise famous actors so desperate for the money?And a sequel is in development!

123,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,Machete Kills? Yes. Yes he does.,8,10 October 2013,"The first Machete was a fun, unapologetically bloody and silly action ride. And ""Kills"" outdoes it's predecessor, both in blood and fun. Story? President Charlie Sheen needs Machete to stop an insane, schizophrenic revolutionary leader from launching a doomsday missile at the Capitol, all while fighting off master assassins, a crazed woman and her brothel soldiers, crooked cops, and countless henchmen/fodder. And if all that sounds crazy, then you don't know Machete. It gets waaay crazier. The acting is good for what this is. Nobody's ever winning any awards for this, but Charlie Sheen - I'm sorry, Carlos Estevez - as the president is damn funny, Damian Bichir plays a great psychopath, and Amber Heard, Sofia Vergara, Michelle Rodriguez, Lady Gaga, and Alexa Vera all provide enough funny lines and eye candy to keep you happy. What's great about ""Kills"" is that it never takes itself too seriously. All those classic action tropes? Machete hits them all with the grace of an 18-wheeler in a china shop. Which is to say, they not-very-subtly make fun of most action tropes. (What's the deal with that countdown timer? Didn't we have 4 hours left to live like 2 days ago??? Was that 4 business hours? Do bomb timers get affected by daylight savings??? And can Machete breathe in space? Because he just took his helmet off...Sandra Bullock couldn't do that sh*t. Maybe they should have sent Machete up there to get her instead...he wouldn't have been so whiney about everything...)Look, just like most movies, Machete has an audience. This ain't for everyone, without a doubt. (My lady sat this out out, making this A BRO'S NIGHT OUT, AWWWWW YEAAAA BRO!!!) But if you love the grindhouse style of action, this is for you. If you've ever played Mortal Kombat and thought, ""Man, Shang Tsung's fatality WAS SOOO SICK BRO!!!"", this movie's for you. If you want to have a good time and don't need Oscar nominations to make the movie for you, then get in on this. Machete Kills could not be any more of an opposite to Gravity, and yet it equally scores a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Two very different experiences, but they're equally worth the trip to the movies. Just pick your flavor. And by the way, that scene from the trailer with the fuze box...probably one of the more TAME kills in the movie. The Mortal Kombat developers should be taking notes for the next game...(Hey guys, thanks for reading my review.

Because why would you go to see this one if you knew how the first one was, for that matter are you even familiar with the Robert Rodriguez genre? I voted your review as ""not helpful"" because it was all BS.In any case for the rest of you who did see and liked the first Machete you will not be disappointed, the sequel matches up very nicely with even more ridiculousness than the first. I honestly wasn't sure if this movie would ever get made, I was pleasantly surprised they used the innocuous title they said they were going to use in the original.Fans of Rodriguez will not be disappointed with the wit and humor of the fantastic cast; especially Demian Bichir who plays Mendez. I had wished there was more Antonio Banderas and less Amber Heard and maybe I'll mention that to Robert if I ever meet him.Not all the jokes were funny but that gave it the element of cheeziness one would expect, like when Michelle Rodriguez and Amber Heard are trading one liners you half expect Machete to tell them both to shut up because they can't trash talk. I sat through til the end of the credits to see any out-takes and it wasn't worth it; just like two 5 second spots. Gaga was pretty bad-assed but i felt she could have played a larger role i.e. more screen time.In all, I gave it 8 stars, definitely a fun movie.",Machete Kills

126,demetriocoffman,Machete Kills will kill you with boredom.,4,11 October 2013,Machete Kills is nothing compared to the first flick. Danny Trejo is joined by more cameo appearances that Hollywood Squares game show. The characters portrayed by the big stars are not matched up to make them half way believable. Charlie Sheen as the President of the U.S. is like a TV sitcom and Sophia Vergara screeching through the sound system almost makes you want to plug your ears. There are too many serious dialogues between nutty characters in this action comedy. The first Machete was uniquely funny with the movie watcher waiting for the next scene to scream laughing.

As in the first film, I got the impression the actors were enjoying themselves, in fact Robert Rodriguez, Danny Trejo were on a program and said the actors appearing in the films say they are getting a chance to do something that the studios they usually work for don't let them do. It's over the top, violent, tongue in cheek. Was it as good as Machete? No, I didn't think so, maybe a little too long but it was a fun ride. We'll see if a third will really be made.",Machete Kills

Machete is supposed to be bad, that Grindhouse exploration bad that is so over the top bad it becomes good. And on that level I find the first movie to be a success, the flaws in the film somehow make it all the better. The sequel however, is an utter failure, the flaws in the film make it unbearable to watch.The film opens with a trailer for a sequel to the movie your about to watch, which spoils the movie for you. And the movie really just seems like a way to set up Machete kills again. The pop culture gags are just embarrassing and cringe inducing, yeah it's funny that the president is sleeping with 3 women, cause it's Charlie sheen. The changeling character is beyond asinine and rather than give Cuba Gooding Jr or antonio banderas adequate screen time, we get to watch lady Gaga. We get to see a cringe inducing Sofia vergaras as a really stupid hooker who thinks she's a threat because she has boob and dick guns. (The same dick gun we saw 20 years ago in from dusk til dawn).All in all Machete kills is a complete waste of time and completely and utterly fails to carry on the spirit of the first Machete or its grindhouse roots.

That's old news already ... it's just boring after it starts repeating like a gif. I admit this stuff is Not usually my cup of tea to begin with but due to the stellar cast I was willing to give it a try ....sadly star power did not save this film.

131,m-a-elsewhere,Possibly the film of the century,9,11 March 2014,"Simply put, this might be the finest motion picture so far this century. A coming of age meditation by turns elegant, delicate, and demur, MACHETE KILLS is rated ""R"" for ""replete with subtle nuances"" evoking the whimsical pastel visions of James Ivory, Bernardo Bertolucci, Wes Anderson and Eric Rohmer, while providing a showcase for such Latin- American cinema icons as Mel Gibson and Elon Musk (inventor of the Tesla). One suspects the only people who can resist this movie's lures are very likely anti-Mexican bigots...Nah, just kidding, bro'.More to the point, MACHETE KILLS is rated ""R"" for ""relleno""--'cuz it's stuffed to bursting with gloriously unhinged exuberance. A relentlessly rollicking mad marvel, most freakin' amazeballs so to speak. Plot? There's oodles of it, nearly all irrelevant. This tongue-in-cheek, kaleidoscope mix of mayhem, sex, slaughter, sci-fi, satire, shenanigans and spy spoof establishes Danny Trejo's Machete Cortez as a direct descendant of such '60s anti-James-Bond anti-heroes as James Coburn's Derek Flint (OUR MAN FLINT) and Dean Martin's Matt Helm (MURDERERS' ROW), albeit in an adventure amped-up and cracked-out with habanero-hot dialogue and gallons of gore. As a gonzo action-film director, Robert Rodriguez stands alone with only Yoshihiro Nishimura providing even distant competition. One can but wonder where the series might go from MACHETE KILLS—oh, wait...that's right: Rodriguez begins the movie with a trailer for his next installment! So there's hope that soon Machete will kill again...In Space!",Machete Kills

Ol' Bobby Rodriguez still has his touch. This is definitely one of the great movies of the 21st century. It will hold a place near the top of the list of great films of our time. Machete Kills is a modern marvel of cinematic achievement. A high water mark of film making and civilization itself. This movie has it all: action, suspense, beautiful scantly clad women, explosions, disguises, nuclear bombs, and a cast of stars. It also provides quality instruction on how to hold, swing, carry, and use a machete in extreme situations. I found myself taking notes and practicing moves while watching this movie on repeat in my living room. In fact, by the Machete School of Mexican Arts rules and regulations, I am a red belt! This movie is the best and everyone should watch it.",Machete Kills
135,jaythejza,Awesomely crazy! Took the good from the original & added more exploitation ridiculousness!,8,13 October 2013,"As a fan of the original Machete, I was pretty excited when I heard they were making a sequel. Watching this I got exactly what I expected, over the top violence & action, plenty funny jokes and laughs at the many random ways of Machete taking out his opponents, as well as the many cameos in the movie. It was a great movie, but I cant help but feel by making the movie more ridiculous and funny in that way, the story kinda suffered, compared to the original.Machete (Danny Trejo) finds himself being hired by the US government to stop a missile being launched at Washington. The story follows his journey across Mexico and back, running into a few crazy characters along the way, both friend & foe.I think the film managed to hit all its goals, this isn't a film for everybody, probably those with a twisted sense of humour. Machete Kills does not take itself seriously, as I'm sure you could imagine for a film directed by Robert Rodriguez. I would best describe this movie as saying its like Hot Shots or Naked Gun, with a whole boat of over the top violence and gore thrown in. This film attempts to be a homage to 60's & 70's exploitation movies, which it does with a special trailer at the start, but doesn't quite do it as good as the original. Its the sort of movie you can pick up & laugh at many times, as opposed to taking anything from it.Trejo's depiction of Machete is really well played, again as the quiet silent type, with some awesome funny lines like ""Machete Don't Tweet"". Demian Bichir's Mendez character was pretty good too, adding to the crazy world of the movie, as well as Mel Gibson in a role I can't say I'd ever imagined him to be in, again made it hilarious! Most of his scenes add to the strangest Star Wars tribute I've ever seen! Marko Zaror was a welcome bad ass bad guy, it's been a while since I've seen anyone make an impact with skills like his, almost like a Van Damme type character.If you enjoyed the original Machete, then I would highly recommend going to see this one, as I'm sure you would enjoy it, but you just cant help but feel they lost the feel of the original. As much as they intended to make you feel you were watching an exploitation film of old, it did feel a little more like a violent tribute to Spy Hard. Plenty laughs & absolutely crazy, well worth a watch.",Machete Kills

It bugs me that Amber Heard is in it though- she is by far the worst in it- how she has a career as an actor I'll never understand (well, I have an idea...) but she's just awful.

138,martin-alejandro,So many CAMEOS so LITTLE IMPACT,1,1 January 2016,"This film has no storyline it just creates anything along its way. There are too many cameos and so little impact from those cameos. The whole story looks more like it was promoting its sequel of space but instead off giving us a 2 minute trailer we have to sit and look at a 2 hour trailer. Lady gaga probably didn't have any concert tours so she just went ahead with this film. The biggest disappointed was Mel Gibson because he can act far better than this. This is the first time that I see Mel Gibson given his worst character performance ever. I guess he must have taken acting lessons from Salma Hayek. The films just rips- offs other films and is just unable to come up with own story. Even worse, the whole film focuses entirely in a missile that is going to be blasted off if the heart of Mendez stops beating. Machete does everything to protect the heart and just near the final minutes of the movie, the heart is destroyed making all the sacrifice completely pointless. I will give credit to the actor, Marko Zaror, who has the most memorable role. Sadly, even Machete is rarely used in the film and gets lost because of so many story lines happening at the same time. If you already saw the first Machete film then just repeat it again. Trust me its better than this one.",Machete Kills

The story was really poor and make no sense whatsoever. The acting is well below average - you can imagine with such cast they are probably paid peanuts to perform, so no wonder the ""stars"" aren't interested at all.If I knew it was so bad beforehand I would rather watch Coronation Street.I gave it a 2 purely for 2 reasons :- 1. the cast 2.

I don't know why they make such movies and i don't know why famous starts are involved in it, this movie is 100% a professional mistake.The action scenes and the killing ones are so pathetic, the comedy makes me feel sick. The movie is so ironic, you can't watch it and feel it, you will just wait till it ends, i don't even know why i wasted my time.I feel sorry to rate it 2, with the existence of such starts, like Mel Gibson, Antonio Banderas, Michelle Rodriguez and others. Even the main character, Danny Trejo, is soo lame in his performance, i saw kids performing better than him, he is just not fit to this kind of movies, they are trying to make Machete like Rambo but they are toooo much away, and failing in an incredibly speed way, And the problem is that Robert Rodriguez, wanted to direct a third movie, please, i beg you Robert, don't do it.I gave it 2, and this is how i ranked it. Story:0, Action:0, Comedy:0, Danny Trejo:0, other casts:1, Amber Heard:1, and everything else:0.

The women are beautiful and if the Oscars ever really pulled their head out of their collective ass, Demian Bichir (whom I loved in A Better Life) would qualify for one. I also felt the humor worked. If you don't like this movie, try seeing it after having a shitty day at work. I thought Machete second foray was breezier than the first one, which I liked. All the cleavage in the movie definitely needs a special mention. I liked Machete and I thought this one was a improvement on every count.Since IMDb is insisting, I elucidate what I like about the movie more, I mentioning that I liked the color palette of the movie. I read this colorist's article in Creative Cow about the cinematography work in the movie I must admit it works beautifully.I do wonder, why can't they do more sophisticated action choreography since they are doing it anyway, rather than just having a bunch of people spraying madly at the camera, when the camera zippy cuts to the bad guy taking a bunch of hits and crumpling to the floor in a bout of bad acting. Other than that, they are nailing it.",Machete Kills
142,fraggy,Better than the first one!,10,28 April 2014,"or the second? Better than the previous Machete movie anyway...I lost count with all those movies having sequels and prequels.Anyway, I really enjoyed this one. I expected much worse, but I'm glad I gave it a shot (pun intended), because it is cheesy and gory and totally absurd in the right dosage.A movie without pretense, it delivers. Blood by the buckets full and the action is not half bad even with the reality factor as low as it can get! I'm not a fan of cheesy B action movies, but in this genre this movie is definitely 10 out of 10. Way better than the precious ""episode"".Hope the next one will be just as good!Star War references were funny!Maybe make a Machete meets Blade movie? Mix it with a bit of xeno hunting that involves face huggers and predators and you would have the ideal explosive ingredients. Oh yeah, make them wear back MIB suits for good measure and perhaps add a blundering agent ""naked gun"" Frank Dreblin (may he rest in peace) as their boss and we're about complete ;) Although Machete doesn't need all of that, because Machete stands tall on its own, no need to rip off other movie""s.Cheers!",Machete Kills

The President (Charlie Sheen) recruits Machete (Danny Trejo) into taking out an arms dealer (Mel Gibson) who wants to destroy the world. Now with great films under his belt like the Mexico Trilogy, Sin City and From Dusk till Dawn you would think this one would join that list. Sadly this film barely makes the watchable list. With an awkward first time performance by Lady Gaga and questionable amounts of CGI the legendary director seemed to get lazy in this sequel.

You know that you are going to enjoy hilarious plot, short roles of well known actors and actresses (like Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica alba, or Mel Gibson), lots of bullets, lots of knives, lots of blood, and the firm of Robert Rodriguez, making a film in the line of that 70's B series action movies or the more recent Planet Terror or Grindhouse. If you liked the first Machete film, you will enjoy this one too, even though this is inferior. The film has very good points, like Michelle Rodriguez (always the perfect action woman, who could kick your ass any moment) or Charlie Sheen as The President. It has some weak points too, like Sofia Vergara in a too much maniac role, or Lady Gaga, who just does not fit in the film. Who should watch this film?

Yes, it's pretty cheesy Yes, it's way over the top But also, it was pretty funny and entertain to watchThe never-ending action was quite brutal, yet it has something, like what you were seeing is something come out from a cartoon. The cameos were brilliant and balanced (Lady Gaga, Cuba Gooding Jr) and they deliver something, if not brilliant, at least enjoyable. The feeling of watching a film with that atmosphere from a bond film (even with the villain) and several shout outs to the action of the 80's films is funny (if you're into 80's parodies, check out far cry 3 blood dragon). Seeing Mel Gibson as the loony villain was clever, like if his actual fame was put into good use (still, he is one hell of a good actor and director nevertheless)All the pop culture references are there: star wars, star trek, james bond, rodriguez past films gimmicks, etc. This movie has it all! (even bad and tedious things, but that's good)Don't expect a film with a transcendent plot or brainy themes: just explosions, women, sci fi, and all sort of wackiness and mischief of the good type. And if everything of this doesn't compel you to watch it, just check out the initial and final scene: MACHETE IN SPACE!!!Just remember: watch it with some snacks or something.

Ignore the critics!,10,14 October 2013,"I can honestly say that Machete Kills is the most entertaining thing I have seen at the cinema in years, if not ever (and I'm 47).I enjoyed the first film, but in my eyes this is a rare example of a sequel that eclipses the original. Logic is thrown out the window, and every scene is a kaleidoscopic, hyper-kinetic explosion of humour, violence, machismo, excitement, sex & insanity. All the characters are larger than life and dripping with undiluted cool. The story races along like an out of control juggernaut & the plot twists, turns, spirals & back-flips all over the place, yet somehow the raw energy of the direction holds everything together.There literally isn't one dull moment. If you're not grinning or shaking your head in amazement from start to finish, then you probably just don't get it, or have become dead inside. The only bad thing I can say about Machete Kills is that real life felt somewhat dull & uninspiring in contrast when we walked out of the cinema.With this in mind, I was shocked to see that the film has flopped at the box office so far, and has a meagre 6.4 star rating on IMDb. Ignore the critics & go see it at the cinema while you can - this film deserves to be seen as loud & larger than life as the characters within it. Machete Kills is an Oasis in a desert of big budget CGI snoozefests and as such it needs your support. If a third instalment isn't made I'll be crying tears of blood.",Machete Kills

It's not as if this film doesn't try to be entertaining, but the action scenes are so ridicules and uninspired,that they are well,not fun to watch. The premise sounds good enough,with Danny Trejo as Machete, The Mexican killing machine who reaps out violence against those that are evil, but I was let down with this film, as I was with the first Machete film. Demian Bichir steals the show,as a split personality drug lord gone renegade,but none of the other actors are fun to watch. And what ever happened to Mel Gibson?!

The scenes are boring, uncreative and mainly repetitive.After about 85 minutes through the movie (where it clearly should have ended) I got out my phone and found out the film still had a good half an hour left.Both myself and my friend left the cinema.

Because of a mission where Machete's partner gets killed by a gang of masked men Machete is sent on a mission by the U.S President, played by Charlie Sheen in a way reminiscing of his days in Hot shots. A villain with a multiple personality disorder is his target, but the chase reveals an even bigger villain with ambition for world domination. Form here on it's like watching Space balls or Hot shots mixed with Bad taste. Usually it's a mix I can appreciate but there is something lacking.

160,Richard-Noggin,"re: John Baggs' ""review""",6,11 October 2013,"1. ""Poor acting, poor dialogue, even worse actors. I didn't see the first one and will not see this one either."" - DUH. This is what happens when one segment of society is bound and determined to shrink government so small that it can be drowned in a bathtub; things tend to get a bit, shall we say, dumbed-down. 2. ""People who actually pay money to see these films are as brain-dead as the writer, director and producers of these films."" - This, written about people who make a great living producing movies... written by someone who, based on the text of his review, probably has yet to achieve one accomplishment of note that even remotely compares to the production of just one movie.3. ""These remind me of the old Blacksploitation films in the 70s, only they are considerable lower budget and lower class."" - Again, DUH. Uh, that was kind of the point, John Baggs. These movies are an HOMAGE (do the google) to 70s grindhouse and blacksploitation movies. The excessive scratching on the film stock? Intentional, to give the movie the ""feel"" of a 70s grindhouse/exploitation film. There are many other things in the movie that directly pay homage to the 70s films, and you can find these elements in many Rodriguez and Tarantino films. Since it reminded you of a 70s blacksploitation movie, I would say ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"", and not ""lower budget, lower class"", etcetera. 4. ""Honestly I can't think of a single good thing to say about it."" - Since you didn't see EITHER of the Machete movies, yet insisted on commenting about them, I am not surprised that you are unable to say anything good about them. Generally, to develop an opinion (that matters), one must EXPERIENCE the subject at hand. I guess your parents didn't teach you that, ""if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all"". If they had, perhaps you would not have commented and could be given the benefit of the doubt that you might be intelligent.5. ""Meth-Head Charlie, Crack-Head Danny, and Brainless Jessica. What a team. The three of the together couldn't make one good brain between them as evident of their acceptance to participate in this film, but then I guess when you are broke (or drugged out like Charlie, you'll do anything for money. "" - Let's do the math, shall we? Charlie, Danny, Jessica.... many movie credits, many accomplishments in life, respectable bank accounts. John Baggs? Produces rambling, semi-literate ""reviews"" of movies that he has never seen, so that he can attack people who have actually succeeded in life. Sorry John, but the math doesn't add up in your favor. In summary, Machete Kills is exactly what it is advertised to be. It is an homage to 70s grindhouse and exploitation films. Why attempt apple v. orange comparisons between an intentional B movie, and Oscar-caliber films (that John Baggs probably hasn't seen either)? Why not just get some popcorn and enjoy it?

Most negative reviews pointed the distance from the original this movie took while the good enjoyed the exaggerated killings and the silliness of the entire movie.What I didn't understand is what made the original so good. Now I know. Just like a joke needs a little truth in it to be funny a movie needs to take itself a little serious, at least at some point. This movie doesn't respect itself enough to even end.There were a couple parts that were funny and ""I got the humor."" It was just insulting to watch. I gave it 3 stars for the humor and would have given it 2 more had it not ended sooo badly.

Since I was expecting it to be Over-The-Top, I won't complain about it. If it was done a little more sparingly I think it would have been better.

Robert Rodriquez gave us the first Machete back in 2010 and though it has been a while since I've seen it, I recall it being a fun, energetic, bloodbath that hit all of its marks. It was self aware without being obnoxious. This time around, it appears the entire reason the film was even made was to name drop the kooky celebrities the coaxed in to signing on. The story follows Machete (Danny Trejo) who is sent on a mission to stop a Mexican revolutionary who is threatening the US though it really doesn't matter. The plot is not the driving force behind films like this, it's the radical kills and laughable gore and that is where this film fails on every level. The biggest mistake was the extreme lack of practical effects. For some reason that I completely do not understand, Rodriquez and co. decided it was best for all of the gore effects to be completely CG and went for cheap CG at that (think Birdemic). What made the first so fun in its outlandishness was that it maintained its cool factor while still being completely over the top. Machete Kills isn't interested in that at all. Instead of shining a light on inventive and goofy kills and stunts, it focuses on over done Charlie Sheen gags (credited for the film as his birth name Carlos Estevez), jokes about how crazy Mel Gibson is, and Lady Gaga briefly having a man's voice. The dialog is terrible even for a film like this and it isn't aided by the stale or just plain bad performances. Cuba Gooding Jr. is briefly in this film and it must be noted that he is hands down the best part and it is very unfortunate that he only got roughly 45 seconds of screen time total. It's a lazy film and a waste of time and if they do intend on making Machete Kills Again In Space like this film claimed they were, let's just hope that it brings back the fun of the original.",Machete Kills
163,limeyabroad,Over the top in all the best ways,9,16 October 2013,"The thing to understand going into this movie is that it's ridiculous. It knows it and as it is a sequel to a ridiculous film, the audience should know it. It is a sequel to a film that was only supposed to be a fake trailer between two movies on the epic 'Grindhouse' for Pete's sake!That said, it's a ridiculous film with a great cast who are obviously having a lot of fun, and that meant that the audience I was with was also having fun. What amazed me about the audience was it was made up of my wife and I, around 20 folks who won't see their 75th birthday again and a few others - not the audience one would expect for this.There are 101 deaths in this movie, and they are all funny as hell. There are decapitations, evisceration, folks turned inside out, impalings and all manner of fun to be had.Danny Trejo, who has a great face for radio, is irresistible to the ladies and that is perhaps this movie's biggest leap of faith. He has badass weaponry, and when he gets it, and it's explained what it does, you are waiting for each piece to be used.Mel Gibson is the best he's been since the first Lethal Weapon, and a new career path is now open to him playing nutjob bad guys. Charlie Sheen is a hoot too.Bring on the third movie to wrap this story up!!!",Machete Kills

Violence (which always is a good thing) was misused here. The effects are awful, but watchable (at least part of them) The movie has ""no history"" and has nothing to do with the original (which is sad). I was expecting MUCH more ... but all I got was a huge disappointing.If you don't believe me watch it.... if you do, and still wanna watch, watch it high as you can, you might enjoy a bit: ""good"" cast cameos all the way.

Even with the big-name cast, there isn't anything here to redeem it for lovers of a a good (or even average)dramatic movie. However, if you want a great comedy.....What this movie is, and what some reviewers don't seem to get, is a complete spoof. This is a deliberately over-the-top attempt at creating a classic B-movie. Or if you've ever watched Hispanic TV, with all the poor over-acting and outrageous situations...that's what this is. This is not geared to someone who wants a great movie, but to someone who simply wants to laugh at poor film-making.It is an extremely violent and graphic movie, but you don't really notice or care, because of how funny the poor acting is. And how so many people with automatic weapons, can miss so many targets standing in the open only feet away....well, that's what this kind of movie is all about.Personally, I'm sorry I wasted the money on a ticket.

This movie does not win any Oscars but oh my god it is entertaining. Script of the movie is more than excellent, I totally lost the count of hilarious details of absurdities. Only true B movie lover like Rodriguez can create this joyride. Machete Kills is even better than the first one. It is rare that sequel can be better than the original, but this is.This movies casting is just perfect. Every character fits perfectly to every scene. Charlie Sheen as president of the United States and Lady Gaga as one identity of the most dangerous assassin just a few to mention. Every character is just the correct piece of this broken puzzle as Rodriguez has mentioned to be. Mel Gibson is just so talented actor that he raises above others even that his screen time is less than others.There is only one big flaw in Machete Kills and it dropped one point off from my rating. In this movie genre there just needs to be nudity, but it is totally missing here. Rodriguez had it in the first movie and it seems so strange that female nudity was left totally out. Was it the request from studio or what? I would like to hear Rodriguez explanation for this because that would make this the best movie that he has done so far.I'm eagerly waiting Rodriguez next project and also hope that big studios will continue to give money for talents like he to make really enjoyable movies for us movie freaks.

Plot basically described in the title...While I have not been left with any long-lasting memories from this film, I was never bored while watching it. It has action, it's funny, the pace is good and has a decent amount of eye candy without stepping too far into soft core territory. If the film had to be put into a category; then entertaining nonsense would be a fair fit. It isn't trying to be deep or meaningful, it just wants to keep your eyeballs busy: it does just that.The film's tongue is stuck so far into it's cheek it is almost beyond recrimination.

Although I enjoyed some of Rodriguez/Tarantino movies this one is a pile of you-know-what.Apart of all the other things the last thing which could get the movie 2 two stars instead of just one would be seeing a bit more of Jessica Alba, but Rodriguez didn't manage even to do that as he made her die around the forth minute of the movie.",Machete Kills

The original was a tad more serious and had some really badass parts while this one was just non stop cheesy and Grindhouse-y. If you saw the first one, you pretty much know what to expect and what the basic concept is. Just times that times ten and you have Machete Kills.

President of the US is played by Charlie Sheen. the only think missing from his performance is a lb. of cocaine with a giant straw carried by an aide . Instead of watching it just see if your local mental professional can spare a does of Thorazine, easier than watching this whatever it is AND the ending introduces a sequel where our hero takes his body chopping skills to outer space.

The movie connoisseur will appreciate the references, gore aficionados will be surprised by the new ideas and some special type of geek is to salivate with pleasure and will be looking for the next one. Everyone else, I'm sorry if you had wrong expectations. I just had none except for fun. It might be a polarizing flick, so be warned.The movie takes you on a ride hardly seen before nor experienced.

175,AlephCreates10,The magic is gone...,2,23 January 2014,"Robert Rodriguez has a real gift for creating unique characters and enjoyable plots... But this time, the magic didn't happen for me.First of all, it didn't feel like a Robert Rodriguez movie. The script didn't have the same wit and cleverness as his previous work. It didn't have the same vision either...Also, there were too many characters and too many subplots in the movie. The movie felt overcrowded and disjointed because of that. It was hard to care for the characters and for the countless action scenes. In the first movie (and other R.R. movies), the action scenes always felt like little masterpiece events. Not this time.The great actors did an amazing job, but the movie had no room for them to show fleshed out characters, so it felt like a missed opportunity. In the first movie, all the supporting characters had the chance to evolve into something ""meaningful"" and had a purpose in the resolution of the conflict. I didn't see that with Sofia Vergara, Vanessa Hudgens, Lady Gaga or Alexa PenaVega's characters.Because of the many subplots and the way they were connected to the main story, it felt like a series of gags and repetitive plot points. I truly believe that an episodic format would've been more successful and more enjoyable to watch on the internet.To be honest, I was very disappointed with this one. I didn't even enjoy it. MACHETE was a real gem, I would dare to say a masterpiece. But at this point, I would rather forget MACHETE KILLS and hope that MACHETE KILLS AGAIN IN SPACE never happens.But I can't wait to see the Sin City sequel! :)",Machete Kills

This film trys to be a funny spoof and it cant do that right. I just really cant put into words how much i disliked this film.

178,youjusz-900-80067,"""Machete don't fail"" the fans (and fans only) in ""Machete Kills""",8,24 January 2014,"The story of Machete, a tough Mexican vigilante ""out to settle the score"" has been a long one. On the set of his movie ""Desperado,"" Robert Rodriguez was introduced to his cousin, Danny Trejo, who had a role as a hit-man in the film. The writer/director was inspired by the actor's physical appearance and so he created the character of Machete. The idea for a full feature film was given some time. In 2007, Rodriguez and his friend Quentin Tarantino created ""Grindhouse,"" a double-feature film meant to pay tribute to and spoof the cheap American films of the 1960s and the 1970s. A Rodriguez-made fake trailer for ""Machete,"" which featured Trejo in the titular role as a man going out against the people who double-crossed him, was a part of the project. The trailer, however, received much interest from the fans, and so in 2010, Rodriguez finally made his vision come true in the full feature film. Now, Machete cuts his way back to the audience...Literally moments after a traumatic experience, Machete (Trejo) is recruited by the President of the United States, Rathcock (portrayed by Charlie Sheen, credited with his original name, Carlos Estevez). Machete's mission is to go to Mexico and find Mendez ""The Madman"" (Damien Bichir), a revolutionary suffering from multiple personality disorder. ""The Madman"" threatens to launch a missile at Washington. Upon arrival in his homeland, Machete discovers that things are much more complicated and what he was told to do might be just a part of what he is going to have to do, as he is followed by hit men, drug cartels, a ""men-despising"" Madame Desdemona (Sofia Vergara) and her prostitutes, and many other individuals. It all will eventually lead him, however, to Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), whose actions may have serious consequences not just for Mexico or the United States, but for the entire world...Machete Kills is a corny, action- and humor-packed, fun film - just what it is meant to be. The movie, just like about every one of Rodriguez's works, is not supposed to be taken seriously. The feature starts by making up for Machete's biggest deficit - a fake (?) trailer for the next installment in the franchise, Machete Kills Again... in Space. The trailer supposedly features Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Bieber and is a clear spoof of Star Wars. But that's not even two minutes of craziness - and it gets so much crazier after that.There are, naturally, many references to pop culture. The trailer at the beginning and many scenes from the final act are throwbacks to Star Wars. Other references may include the ones to Mad Max, or Moonraker. There are also tons of references to the previous films of Rodriguez, such as Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, From Dusk till Dawn, Planet Terror (the director's segment of Grindhouse) and obviously the first Machete. All of these provide for a great time for anyone who likes the films to which the references are made, and certainly a treat to all fans of Robert Rodriguez.The acting, when it's not purposefully bad, is outstanding. Damien Bichir and Mel Gibson deserve a mention as the film's most prominent villains. Both of the actors appear to have had a great time on the set and portray their characters with much energy and distance. And of course, Danny Trejo as the Mexican not to be messed with, pulls off his character perfectly.Although the script was written by Kyle Ward (based on Rodriguez's story) rather than Rodriguez himself, due to the tone and the humor of it, it feels completely like Rodriguez's work. The director, as usually, was involved in many other aspects of filmmaking, such as production, composing the score (which is, as always in his works, fitting and memorable), editing, etc.Overall, Machete Kills is a fun exploitation film. It's more intentionally ridiculous, funnier and more ""grindhouse-y"" than its predecessor. It is certainly not for everyone, but Robert Rodriguez's fans should have a blast. Being one of them, I definitely hope that ""Machete Kills Again... in Space"" will see the light of day. And then, maybe, ""Machete Continues to Kill,"" ""Machete Still Kills,"" ""Machete Kills Some More"" and ""Machete Retires from Killing... to Kill All Over Again""? We'll see, but as long as Rodriguez and Trejo are game, so am I.",Machete Kills

The minimum background required to can make a movie review is to have seen the review. When you don't have seen it you cannot make a review. You can pretend, but thats irrelevant and nobody is interested to hear your opinionated opinion on something you know nothing about. If a book critic was to give a negative review of a book he don't have read, will you refuse to read that book? Will you take that critic seriously? I think your comment, as its a comment and not a review, should be place in the forum part, or not be there at all, and should be removed from here both for the reasons named above and because you are too hateful to be taken seriously. You must have personal grudges to come over so hatefully and angrily for reasons we don't care to know.Thanks for the two others, who have actually seen the movie for their very useful comments.For another look at self appointed movie critic with not much of an audience, who also sabered that movie, look at this one here:http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20131008/WIRE/131009560?p=2&tc=pgBut with that exception on Mel Gibson's character in the movie:""(...) But the truly inspired (or demented) casting, is Mel Gibson as Voz, the brains and the payroll behind the villainy. Gibson comes with more baggage than Kim Kardashian on a road trip, but the guy can still really act, and he understands perfectly what Rodriguez is after here: a mix of the absurd and the more absurd, but played straight.""Mel Gibson is so talented an actor, that he cant do for carrying a movie. He end up as becoming the main character even if he isn't, through his cheer talent. And this is demonstrated here again. No matter what role he plays, he is always convincing, and you believe he is the guy he is acting as. Whether he is acting a Shakespeare play or mad max or lethal weapon or we were soldiers, or the bounty, or edge of darkness, you simply cant imagine him being anyone else. I have to confess that he is the alone true actor in the entire casting. So being noticed as being the best in that movie, didn't required much form him.",Machete Kills

I was not surprised to see this movie didn't fare well on it's debut, but most movies like this don't perform spectacularly as the target audience is not the mass millions.Although somewhat choppy the ensemble styled cast made this a great picture. Mel Gibson as the bad guy, a step out of character for him, and Charlie Sheen as President fit perfectly with the style of the film. Was enjoyable to see Cuba Gooding, Jr. and a few others in supporting roles, but they all fit in very well with spirit of this movie.This movie likely will never achieve the status it deserves but I like it every bit as much as the double length ""Grindhouse Presents"" film.

Trejo has been my favorite actor of all times and I am an enormous Robert Rodriguez film. I have seen all of his movies from El Mariachi trilogy and Road Racers to Grindhouse, Sin city, spy kids, you name it, I've seen it all. Machete Kills however is so over the top, so violent, so funny in a very creative Rodriguez way that I don't see how any action movie fan could resist watching it at least once. Machete Kills explores a completely different plot line from the original Machete. Personally I enjoy this movie for that reason because I'm not too big of a fan of repetition. Its also amazing how Robert Rodriguez always casts the most interesting actors together from Robert Deniro, Lindsay Lohan and Jessica Alba to Mel Gibson, Lady Gaga, and Carlos Estavos (also known as Charlie Sheen). So for anyone who loves Danny Trejo, Robert Rodriguez, or action movies in general, I highly recommend you do yourself a favor; ignore the low ratings for this movie and go buy tickets to check out Machete Kills for yourself.

In times when movies like Thor 2 get 7.8 points on IMDb, machete deserves 10 just for being truthful to its genre. I enjoyed every minute of it - and yes, if you expect a Hollywood-grade, perfectly polished action movie: Come on, go watch something else. I can say i had more fun watching this movie than any action movie the last 3 years and hope that Rodriguez will not get discouraged by too many people who just don't understand his work. Give me some link to donate, I will!",Machete Kills
192,mail-847-606793,Don't let him make ....... in Space,1,18 November 2013,"What kind of a movie is this, I really don't know why I watch it in first place, I saw 6.1 rating on IMDb and going with there rating I saw it, please please don't watch even if you don't have anything to do. its really a stupid movie, Robert Rodriguez must be stop from making any movie in future, also Danny Trejo does he think he is a hero type, what a waste. I really don't have anything to saw, but IMDb want at least 10 lines else there is nothing to write about it, Mel Gibson I am a really big fan of yours why on earth you do this kind of movie. what else can I write about it other then asking you not to watch it, and IMDb must also add there system to allow fake rating of movie, I just saw that this movie is having 6.1 rating and I order it.",Machete Kills
193,docleano,Insulting for cinema,1,9 March 2014,"First installation of Machete was great, cause it had all the elements of a grindhouse genre! Now this one is very hard to describe, cause it is absolutely terrible in every possible way: acting, cinematography, plot, even editing(Robert's trademark) was left out. This was shot, just so cast and crew can have a fun! Eventually everyone made money,but what is with a legacy Mr.Rodriguez?!! Man you gave us El Mariachi, Desperado, From Dusk Till Down, what happened to the whole making inexpensive movies, with a great plot. Go back to shooting on film,digital makes you no different then local Las Vegas filmmakers........",Machete Kills
194,tamecenobite,Transcendent,10,12 May 2014,"There are many motion pictures that one might call a movie with a cast of actors. Machete Kills, however, is a film in which thespians truly explore the depths of humanity in this gift to humanity. Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriguez reprise their timeless roles for this film, and they are joined by acting legends Amber Heard, Carlos Estevez, and Lady Gaga; along with lesser know but talented none the less actors such as Mel Gibson (whom you may remember for his part in a lesser known indie movie about a Scottish folk hero).I shan't spoil this film, to do so would be a grave injustice. But what I can tell you is that this movie is transcendent. The plot is highly cerebral, though the action allows for even those who may have trouble following such a masterpiece to enjoy this wonderment.If you enjoyed the first Machete film, you are truly in for a treat. If you have yet to see this film, I am jealous of you in that I can never again view this artistic masterpiece for the first time again, but the magic shall entertain for years to come.",Machete Kills
