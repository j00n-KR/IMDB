0,bkoganbing,Let us return to those thrilling days of yesteryear,4,5 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger came to television two years after I made my earthly debut and I can as a little kid still recall Gerald Mohr's voice narrating the beginning of the program. Fran Striker's character had been on radio for a good ten years previous, at least on network radio and the story behind the masked man and his faithful Indian companion Tonto were universally known. Back in those days a hero character like The Lone Ranger was accepted without reservations or qualifications. To bring it to today's audience in a more cynical age just would not fly.But better that it be consigned to the TVLand channel than to be given what we get here. The story of The Lone Ranger is told to a small child by an aged Tonto played by Johnny Depp who recounts how the partnership came into being. Having seen the 90 minute three part episode involving the massacre of the company of Texas Rangers I knew the story and was ready for the variations to come.Armie Hammer plays John Reid younger brother of the Texas Rangers captain and sole survivor of the massacre in a box canyon by the Butch Cavendish gang. Back in that pilot Glenn Strange played Cavendish and he was your typical western villain of the day.William Fichtner plays a Cavendish with some real issues. Normally I would never be siding with these 'family' groups as they rarely take my part in any social issue. But I can sure see why they were down the Disney Studio for producing this. Like it or not the Magic Kingdom has its reputation for family entertainment and those who were looking to see something from the yesteryear of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels got the shock of their lives.And Armie Hammer as the self righteous bordering on the doofus who becomes The Lone Ranger was too much for me. Johnny Depp also as Tonto whom we learn was a Comanche carried a joke too far. I've always liked Depp as an actor who takes on some quirky projects and makes them pay off artistically, flops badly here.In 1981 there was an attempt to revive the Lone Ranger which failed miserably. On the strength of Depp's prestige this will attract the curious like myself. Still I would say you're not missing much if you fail to see The Lone Ranger of the 21st century.",The Lone Ranger
1,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly likable Disney blockbuster is much better than expected,6,26 March 2017,"Given that it bombed at the US box office on release, I found THE LONE RANGER a surprisingly enjoyable movie and a nice tribute to the TV series and characters of old. Yes, it's a typically overblown Hollywood blockbuster, all style over substance, and with a running time of no less than two and a half hours it's grossly overlong and padded out with endless action sequences which verge on the tedious at times.Elsewhere, THE LONE RANGER proves fitfully engaging, and features a winning performance from Johnny Depp as the mostly silent Native American sidekick, Tonto. It surprises me to admit that I enjoyed his performance, because I haven't liked much he's made in the last couple of decades, with SWEENEY TODD the only time I really warmed to his character. And I actively dislike his silly overacting in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchise and DARK SHADOWS. Here, he fits the role nicely, and is a real asset.That this film is flawed is a given. Armie Hammer's hero veers on the side of slimy rather than likable, and there's too much of the CGI-enhanced action to entertain audiences. The climax, with all kinds of madcap stunts, explosions, and effects, is a case in point. I'd much prefer a film which is more grounded in reality, but the trend for outlandish, incessant CGI puts paid to that kind of thing. Still, for a modern-day Disney film, THE LONE RANGER isn't bad at all, and certainly better than many rival productions that are lauded by audiences (THE HUNGER GAMES series, for instance).",The Lone Ranger
2,SnoopyStyle,problematic,6,7 August 2013,"At a Wild West Exhibit, an old man (Johnny Depp) claims to be Tonto as he recounts to a little boy how he ended up robbing a bank with The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer).It starts off well with a fun engaging action sequence on a train. Sadly the movie takes an one hour nap after that. Armie Hammer plays the Lone Ranger as a pathetic weak naive boy scout. It is annoyingly unLone-Ranger-like and very infuriating. Johnny Depp creates a wholly new Tonto. The danger here is he almost overshadows the lead in another one of his wacky creations. There is also a missed opportunity of casting a real native actor. The fact is Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer should and needed to have better chemistry. They don't work well together. This film doesn't work well because they didn't get the characters right.",The Lone Ranger
3,Prismark10,The William Tell Torture,1,8 December 2013,"The hound from hell was let loose on the Hollywood hills and dropped a big toxic turd. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer found the turd and named it The Lone Ranger.The team that hit pay dirt with the Pirate of the Caribbean films and could not believe their luck that the stupid sequels still rolled in the money they went back for one more concept film.Within the opening 10 minutes you get the feeling that this film may not be good as we see an elderly Tonto in a museum with flashbacks. That seem to be confusing before we get to a story.We have a tale of railroads being built and the company owner is played by Tom Wilkinson who normally plays a villain in big budget Hollywood films (I wonder if that will be important later) and then you have Armie Hammer who makes Channing Tatum look like Kenneth Branagh who plays a lawyer whose brother a Marshall is cruelly murdered by a notorious outlaw.Yet at every turn he stops Tonto killing the outlaw because he wants to uphold the law yet never stops to think why this outlaw always seems to escape at every turn or what his plan is?The film deals with issues of how badly Native Americans were treated in the days of the old west. I would sympathise if the producers did not cynically cast a white man called Johnny Depp as Tonto and payed him a lot of money for it.It looks no suitable famous Native American actor was around. I am sure someone would remind me that Depp is 1/8 Cherokee or something similar.But let us be real, almost every famous American be it Bruce Lee, Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Kal Penn, Kim Kardashian or Barack Obama claims to be 1/8 Native American!The director Gore Verbinski cast Helena Bonham Carter for a small role in this film. Hold on Depp and Bonham-Carter in the same film, surely the director figured if the film failed, people would think Tim Burton made this mess.A mess it is. The film is not funny, it's not coherent. I frequently was bored.In the last 20 minutes during the final action sequence, the William Tell overture plays, we do get a real Lone Ranger film. It is too little too late. A deserved flop.",The Lone Ranger
4,claudio_carvalho,Moronic Hero in a Silly and Unfunny Adventure,3,26 October 2013,"In 1933, in San Francisco, a boy visits the Wild West in a sideshow and meets an elderly Tonto (Johnny Depp) in a chamber and the Comanche tells the story of The Lone Ranger to him.In 1869, the idealistic prosecutor John Reid (Armie Hammer) returns by train to his hometown Colby. In the same train, it is traveling the criminal Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) that will be judged for his crimes and hanged in the town due to a request of Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson), who represents the railroad company. However, Butch escapes and John rides with his brother Dan Reid (James Badge Dale) and six other Texas Rangers to capture him. However, the rangers are ambushed and killed by the notorious outlaw and his gang and only John survives. He teams up with Tonto to bring Butch Cavendish to justice in a dangerous journey of discoveries. ""The Lone Ranger"" is a great deception for people from my generation. When I was a boy, the Lone Ranger was among my favorite heroes and I used to read the comic books and watch the show on TV. However, in this cinema version, the Lone Ranger is a moronic hero and the plot is a silly and unfunny adventure of 149 minutes running time. Fortunately I did not go to the movie theater to see this flick that does not work even on DVD. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro Solitário"" (""The Lone Rider"")",The Lone Ranger
5,nogodnomasters,Never take off the mask,8,1 March 2018,"The story is told as a flashback from 1933 with an aged Tonto (Johnny Depp) being a circus Indian attraction. In this saga, the Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) is a straight, rather green marshal who seeks justice and revenge for the death of his brother. He is the reluctant partner of Tonto whose ""mind is broken."" The two form a comedy duo as they go after the bad guys.The plot was secondary to the characters. The film was enjoyable, but not entertaining enough to sit comfortably for over two hours. I felt I sat there for 2 hours of character and plot build-up for one lone climatic William Tell Overture scene. The film lacked a certain cohesion and contained anachronisms. For instance the Sears watch given to a young Tonto prior to 1868 was impossible as the first Sears watch sold was 1886.Great popcorn film. Don't expect an epic. We do find out what Kemosabe means and it was not what my mother told me (king of s***), although Tonto could have lied. There was one scene which could have vindicated mom.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Brothel scene.",The Lone Ranger
6,kosmasp,Long Ranger,8,13 September 2013,"Not everyone is familiar with the Lone Ranger, but the character (and his ""sidekick"") are rooted deep into American culture. Which goes to show you, that other countries won't have the same level of recognition as there is in America. Casting Johnny Depp was genius as was the casting of the Lone Ranger himself. The mix of serious and strange is a good one and works throughout the movie.The casting in general works, even if you can predict what the story is or where it will lead to. And while there might be the occasional ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" flash for some, there are more than a couple of nuances that are different between the characters and their depiction by Johnny Depp.One of the things you can say about the movie is, that it might be too long. It never felt that long, but that was me, others might feel differently. There's also an added ""scene"" during the credits, though nothing much is happening (action-wise) ... Let's say you'll know where this is ""going"" once it starts ""running"" (last being figuratively). Enjoy if you can, though it might not be what some had envisioned",The Lone Ranger
7,classicsoncall,"""Justice is what I seek Kemosabe.""",8,6 July 2013,"I had been patiently anticipating this film after having seen a trailer quite some time ago, and now having viewed it, I have to say it came up a bit short for me in terms of the old nostalgia factor. I guess that's because my personal golden age as a kid took place way back in ancient times, the 1950's, and my boyhood heroes (Superman, Tarzan, and yes, The Lone Ranger) seemed to be 'purer' back then. But I know those times are long gone, and modern day audiences require that 'wow' factor to stay entertained, so I grudgingly go along with it.I think what bothered me most about the film was the way Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer deadpan mugged their way through certain situations. I couldn't picture Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels reacting in the same manner, nor would I have expected them to. Again, it's part of that playing to the audience thing that isn't necessary for me if the dialog is sharp and the story is compellingly written.What I did like about the movie was the retelling of the Lone Ranger origin with the box canyon ambush of the Texas Rangers led by the surly Butch Cavendish gang. I'll give the film makers credit for their selection of William Fitchner to portray Cavendish; the man exuded pure evil and would have been right at home in one of those Pirate movies alongside Johnny Depp. I think the original Butch, Glenn Strange from the Lone Ranger TV series, would have marvelled at his namesake.Another cool nod to the early series, perhaps inadvertent, was when the Ranger shot a gun out of the hand of Tom Wilkinson's bad guy Cole. Clayton Moore would handily do the same thing, even when the outlaw with a gun was right in the middle of a crowd and no one else got hurt. To be sure, guys like John Wayne and Charles Starrett would often do the same thing in their pictures, and it always made me wonder even as a kid, how is that even possible?I had to chuckle over another reviewer's comment about how this was Helena Bonham Carter's best work since such and such. I don't think I'm wrong in saying she wasn't in the movie very much at all, while her trailer appearance made it seem like she was a major character. The wooden-leg gun gimmick was somewhat unique, but it made her character seem just a bit clunky.For action fans, I'd have to say that the Lone Ranger's ride on Silver atop the runaway locomotive was pretty impressive. It was a fitting William Tell Overture-ish sequence that brought back those thrilling days of yesteryear, a phrase that uniquely describes the adventures of the Lone Ranger. Notwithstanding some of the picture's negatives, I'd still recommend it for movie-goers if this is the only way one would ever get to see The Lone Ranger. For me, he'll always remain an American and Western hero icon.",The Lone Ranger
8,lee_eisenberg,optimism to cynicism,6,26 January 2014,"When Gore Verbinski's modern version of ""The Lone Ranger"" got released pretty much all the critics panned it. Watching it I got the feeling that more than anything it was a look at a shift from optimism to cynicism. John Reid (Armie Hammer) sees the law as 100% honest, and finding out that the opposite is true prompts him to become the rebellious title character.Of course, Johnny Depp as Tonto steals the show. His campy performance as the Comanche seeking to avenge the murder of his people IS the movie. I also liked Helena Bonham Carter's brothel madam. My criticism of the movie is that the action scenes are overdone and come across as cartoonish. Then again, the movie is probably supposed to be cartoonish. More than anything it's a fun movie, affirming Johnny Depp as probably the most interesting actor of his generation. I'm going to have to watch the old TV series now.",The Lone Ranger
9,jboothmillard,The Lone Ranger,8,20 September 2013,"From director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), I was at first reluctant to see this film based on the popular TV show because apparently it was a bit of a box office bomb from Disney, but I was willing to try it because the critics gave it good reviews. Basically in 1933, San Francisco, in a fair sideshow, the elderly Comanche Native American Indian, Tonto (Johnny Depp) tells a young boy who idolises the legend known as The Lone Ranger the true story of his experiences while younger in the Old West. In Colby, Texas, 1869, idealistic lawyer John Reid (Mirror Mirror's Armie Hammer) has come home on the incomplete Transcontinental Railroad, managed by railroad tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson), on the same train are two prisoners, Tonto, and outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) who is to be hanged. Cavendish's gang ride alongside the train and make robberies, the outlaw is rescued and the train is derailed, Tonto is put in a jail cell, while John, who tried to stop the rescue, is deputised by his Texas Ranger brother Dan (James Badge Dale), and with six other men they head out to recapture Cavendish. The pursuers are ambushed however in the canyon, Cavendish kills Dan and eats his heart, and John, who is mortally wounded is barely conscious watching, and an escaped Tonto comes along to bury all the bodies, except for John who a white spirit horse points out as being a ""spirit walker"". When conscious and recovered Tonto tells John that as a spirit walker he has been to the other side and come back after ""death"", therefore he cannot be killed in battle, he wants both to bring justice to the criminals and get some form of vengeance for the death of his brother, and as the gang believe him to be dead he wears a mask to protect his identity, made from the clothing of his brother. One of the Rangers, Collins, double-crossed and led the gang to kill them all, so they follow clues to a brothel he visited, run by Red Harrington (Helena Bonham Carter), they get some information before having to escape from the disguised gang, and meanwhile the criminals kidnap Dan's widow Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) and son Danny (Bryant Prince). Cole rescues the widow and son and kills Collins, and he wants to continue the construction of the railroad, and he tells United States Cavalry Captain Jay Fuller (Barry Pepper) that the Comanche are to bed exterminated, the Comanche themselves meanwhile have captured Tonto and John, who found a rail track in the Indian territory. The tribe leader tells John about the past of Tonto, where as a boy he rescued Cavendish and in exchange for a pocket watch showed the location of silver mine, his tribe were murdered to keep the precious metal, so for years he has believed the silver carries a curse that turns men evil, and he has vowed to kill those who killed his people. The cavalry come to attack the Comanche, John and Tonto make their escape and recapture Cavendish, Tonto demands John to kill him with the silver bullet he gave him, but he removes his mask and refuses, and trying to do so himself he is knocked out so the criminal will be taken into custody. He is taken to Cole, who reveals his plans for the upcoming railroad, and he reveals that he is behind the silver mining operation, reluctantly Fuller sides with him, John is taken back to the mine to be executed, but Tonto rescues him, and realising Cole cannot be taken down lawfully John dons the mask again to become officially The Lone Ranger. Cole reveals his intention is to takeover the railroad company completely using the silver, The Lone Ranger and his companion rob a bank to steal all explosive liquids and devices in order to blow up the railroad bridge, and meanwhile they pursue in a second train. Following various jumps from train to train, riding the white horse to chase after it, the trains splitting tracks and many bullets fired, Fuller is killed in action, Cavendish is killed when one train crashes into the other, and after Rebecca and Danny are rescued Cole is killed when the train plunges into the water where the bridge was blown up. The town praise the unknown John, The Lone Ranger, as a hero, and offer him a law enforcement position, but he declines, and he and Tonto ride off into the distance, the Ranger on his white horse, named Silver, shouting the famous catchphrase ""Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!"" Also starring James Frain as Barret and Quantum of Solace's Joaquín Cosio as Jesus. Hammer gives a likable performance as the man who comes back from trauma to bring justice, whether it be lawfully or not, of course Depp steals the show (and it is from his perspective rather than vice versa like usual) as the ""wise"" Indian who believes in the spiritual world but also has ideas to help situations, and there is good support from Wilkinson as the greedy villain, Fichner as the disgusting gang leader, and Carter as the one-legged no nonsense prostitute. The story is put together well, the special effects are put to great use for all the explosive chase and battle sequences, the last twenty minutes with the exhilarating train chase accompanied by the famous William Tell Overture theme music is brilliant, it is a fantastic western action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Visual Effects. Very good!",The Lone Ranger
10,Tweekums,A strange but enjoyable retelling of the Lone Ranger story,8,16 March 2016,"Opening in '30s San Francisco a young boy walks through a funfair and it temped into an exhibition on the old west. After looking at a few boring displays he is shocked when one exhibit features a real live elderly Native American. He is Tonto and he has an amazing story to tell the young boy; a story of how he and the Lone Ranger went up against outlaws, corrupt businessmen and even the US Cavalry in Texas when the West was still wild.Their story starts on a train to Colby, Texas; John Reid is returning home to work as a lawyer, also in board are two prisoners; Butch Cavendish, an outlaw heading to his hanging and a strange Comanche wearing heavy black and white make-up and a dead crow on his head this is Tonto. Cavendish escapes from custody with the help of his band out outlaws. Tonto is put in jail and John is deputised by his brother before a group of Texas Rangers set off after Cavendish. They are betrayed by one of their number and all but John are killed. He is left for dead but is later rescued by Tonto, who has somehow escaped from jail. John dons the famous mask and they set off to catch Cavendish but before they finally bring him to justice we will learn why Tonto is determined to kill him and encounter some interesting characters; some good, some bad.By the time I came to watch this I'd inevitably heard that it had had a poor initial reception and was considered a flop perhaps because of that my expectations weren't that high making it easy to be pleasantly surprised. There are some obvious faults; it is definitely too long and some of the effects are too obviously CGI, despite that it is a lot of fun. Armie Hammer does a solid job as the Lone Ranger but it is an almost unrecognisable Johnny Depp who steals the show as Tonto; it is a truly bizarre but to my mind brilliant performance. The rest of the cast is good too; most notably William Fichtner, who is suitably unpleasant as the villainous Cavendish, Ruth Wilson, who plays the widow of John's brother and Helena Bonham Carter, who puts in a memorable performance as a brothel keeper with a gun hidden in her false leg something I never expected to see in a Disney film! The action is exciting; for the most part it is typical western action but in the final fight between our two heroes and the numerous villains it becomes somewhat madcap to say the least. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting an enjoyable action film that can be enjoyed by adults and youngsters alike.",The Lone Ranger

12,moonspinner55,Too much slam-bang designed to thrill the youthful audiences who failed to show up...but the trains look great!,5,21 May 2014,"21st century revamping of the once-popular radio serial concerning a deputized lawyer named John Reid in 1869 Texas who, aided by escaped convict Tonto, dons a mask and strides a white spirit horse to thwart both an evil railroad tycoon and also the mangy varmint who killed his brother. Despite a prologue and epilogue set in 1933 that do not work, ""The Lone Ranger"" isn't an off-kilter rendering of the tale. It's moderately enjoyable, though massively over-scaled, over-produced, over-acted, over-everything. The film's inflated budget was hardly for naught—the money is there on the screen—however the elephantine production swallows up the central characters, most especially Armie Hammer's John Reid (who barely makes an impression). The marketing focus was, of course, on Johnny Depp as Tonto right from the start, but this gambit failed once audiences discovered that Tonto has very little personality (which Depp's exaggerated facial expressions fail to compensate for). The picture isn't a misfire as much as it is a mismatch, with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and indefatigable director Gore Verbinski shooting the works with a slim western-revenge plot that doesn't quite merit such grandstanding. Still, it's hard to scoff when the trains look this good. ** from ****",The Lone Ranger
13,paul_haakonsen,A fun ride and a great trip back to the good old West...,7,3 October 2013,"Somewhat dreading this movie after having heard nothing but negative things about it, I was almost about to pass up on watching it. But still, I decided to give it a go, as Johnny Depp usually manages to make anything watchable.And now having seen ""The Lone Ranger"", I must admit that I am glad that I did sit down to watch it. This was indeed like taking a trip back to being a little boy, running about outside while playing cowboys and Indians. There was just something very nostalgic to this movie, and it worked out so well.I just have a very vague memory of the Lone Ranger character from when I was a kid, so I really have no particular connection to the story, the characters or the background story for this.Watch the movie for what it is, a wonderful western adventure, mixed up with just the right amount of action and comedy. And the story told in the movie was enjoyable and there was a good, continuous flow to it.Ignore all the bad reviews and the critics on this one, and do yourself a favor and sit down to watch this. If you grew up playing cowboys and Indians, then you definitely don't want to miss out on this one.The cast in ""The Lone Ranger"" was actually quite good, lots of great names. Johnny Depp really carried the movie here with his performance as Tonto. Much can be said about the eccentricity of the character and any possible resemblances to the Jack Sparrow character, but who cares? He did a great job here. And also a big tip of the cowboy hat to William Fichtner, playing Butch Cavendish. He was so well-cast for this particular role.With a feature length of 149 minutes, it might seem somewhat long. But time flies by while watching ""The Lone Ranger"", because you get so caught up in the storyline and there is a good fast pace to the movie.",The Lone Ranger
14,Quinoa1984,"the best, flawed mixed-bag of the 2013 summer blockbusters",7,8 November 2014,"This rating may seem high, given what you may have heard. But to break it down I would give the movie up till the two hour mark like five out of ten stars.It's a bloated yarn that has some strong stuff in it, and an actual good (for what he had to work with) performance from Hammer. But the last twenty minutes or so is spectacular, escapist filmmaking on a grand scale, and delivers finally on what the title entails: rousing action with the William tell overture scoring an immense train chase, edge of your seat (yes ill use that cliché for here) with more than a tip of the hat to Keaton's The general. I'd tune into the movie on TV just to see that again, for how much that latches on to being exciting and a little deranged and with DRIVE.That's the problem; less like Verbinski's previous film, the towering animated spectacle Rango, it's more like At Worlds End, or for that matter Heavens Gate (another bloated Western made by a director fresh off an Oscar win, given a big budget, and doesn't bother to cut back when he should, especially with the obvious political commentary, yup, that's here in Lone Ranger, and epic finale). Verbinski and co can conjure one or two really awe inspiring set pieces, stuff that you know took so much work and paid off... but you are surrounded by characters given too much story, and solid actors not given enough interesting things to say.If anything the dramatic parts of Ranger, or at least how individual scenes are staged, is directed with a good eye and for emotion. its the stupid comedy stuff Depp tries like feeding the dead bird birdseed (a running gag that wears out its welcome) that is at best hit or miss and at worst dreadful. Hell, you could easily lose fifteen minutes off the movie if you cut two things that are extraneous: the unfunny and plodding framing device with little lone Ranger and 120 year old T (or we liked you better when you were Little Big Man), and a lot of the stuff with the Cherokee Indians.That stuff especially padded out the movie, at least for me. Ultimately they are only there to be pawns in a quickly dispatched war, and for one to deliver some semi-tragic back-story on Tonto. It did not seem to add much to the narrative, at least in how the death of Reid's brother and the railroad shenanigans played out (that is to say, I see how it worked here, but it just didn't deliver much in the way of substance, even if the filmmakers and Depp thought it did). And Depp himself is just alright; his character seems to be crazy, wise, sympathetic and just bananas one scene, one LINE, to the next.Depp tries to give it his all, but it is less complex a performance than he thinks it is, or is trying for. In a way Armie Hammer does more with the little he's got, same with Tom Wilkinson and especially William Fichtner. I imagine Helena Bonham Carter is meant to be here more as set up for potential sequels. At the least there are no Orlando Blooms or Kiera Knightleys, just um.,. who played the ex Dan Reid? Totally forgettable.The film is shot with verve style and a modicum of energy and grit, and for sure seeing Monument Valley brings back memories of... greater films. But I cant deny once again what this director did get right in the last act. id give that a full price. The rest is a rental. It's an excessive dive into Hollywood Western blockbusting, and among other films of its ilk from the 2013 season- Star Trek, Man of Steel, World War Z - it finishes the strongest. If only the story had a stronger backbone, or the filmmakers knew when to pull a little back from infantile stuff like, say, a horse s*** joke. Why God why was that there?",The Lone Ranger
15,sunwarrior13,A Boring Remake,4,12 October 2014,"The Lone Ranger is a Western action film and a Bruckheimer/Disney remake of the same title on a radio series back in the 1930's.It features Arnie Hammer and Johnny Depp as the Lone Ranger and his sidekick Tonto respectively. William Fichtner, Barry Pepper, Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter are part of the supporting cast. This is narration of Tonto's memories of his and the Longer Ranger's early efforts to subdue the criminal activities of the corrupt and bring them to justice during the time of the American Old West.The story started when John Reid, a man of the law, transformed himself to becoming the Lone Ranger, a masked hero. Pairing up with an unlikely Native American spirit warrior Tonto, together they brought criminals, lawless and deviants into justice particularly bank robbers. It exhibits their adventures together as well as their humorous friction to stop the corrupt in the West.Too bad that this remake is definitely lifeless, boring and very frustrating as the studio thought that bringing Johnny Depp and featuring the Lone Ranger and Tonto are enough to make a good movie. Too bad that it is no longer the case. The writers never tried to make it interesting nor made an update for the modern audiences as it stuck mainly to what both characters were in the 1930's.The productions effects maybe up-to-date but that is what is wrong with a lot of movies these days as they try to overwhelm the viewer with it while not making an effort on the characters and the screenplay.",The Lone Ranger
16,hitchcockthelegend,Wrong Brother.,9,6 May 2014,"The early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and early critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even had a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a blockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original Lone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking action fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. It's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of yore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans pulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the landscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to past masters of the Western genre, while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona fide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. This is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became The Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian side-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom Wilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain duties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West in is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for eating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some Grindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with sexual energy. It's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the expense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could have been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes, and Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary a dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski throw all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging from ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is bookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes from start to end. There's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the time, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and legends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale. It was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against those damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being as he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer, Hammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were written before the film had even been released, the big budget and production problems clearly making this a big stinker Not so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into anachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it yet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a chance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It also looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even show Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10",The Lone Ranger
17,LeonLouisRicci,The Corruption Of Fantasies,5,17 January 2014,"This might possibly be the most Disappointing Reboot ever. Certainly Fans of the TV Show from the Fifties where Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels Embodied the Masked Man and His Faithful Companion might even find it not only Embarrassing, but Downright Disgusting. Because the Bottom Line here, most of this Movie is Ugly.They get almost everything Wrong except Maybe Silver (the Horse not the other thing). The Lone Ranger is turned into a slightly Effeminate Pacifistic Lawyer that is Miles Away from the Real Character. The Villains are Filthy and Repulsive like something out of a Horror Movie and there is a whole lot of Unpleasantness and Unsightly images going on here that makes it Less than the Inspiration that Impressed and Influenced so many Baby Boomers. The William Tell Overture can't help but arouse and Johnny Depp's Tonto is not a complete Failure but combined with all the other Slop that is on View here, He just barely manages to keep His Head Above Ground in this Train Wreck.Yes, the New Millennium is a Different Time and surely not as Innocent, but that doesn't mean that Fantasies have to be Corrupted like Everything else. So this Mega-Budgeted Misfire has a lot to answer for. In the End it is a Modern Entertainment that has literally Cut the Heart out of the Legacy that is The Lone Ranger.",The Lone Ranger
18,zardoz-13,A Different Interpretation of a Classic Hero,8,15 July 2013,"""The Lone Ranger"" is an entertaining but outlandish western spoof about the origins of the protagonist told from the perspective of his faithful Indian companion Tonto. Since westerns are neither popular nor fashionable, Walt Disney Pictures and producer Jerry Bruckheimer must have felt that the only way to treat the subject matter without alienating audiences was to emphasize comedy. Just about everybody I know has referred to it as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" on the western frontier. The comparison seems apt, too. Director Gore Verbinski helmed the first three ""Pirates"" epics. Johnny Depp starred in them, too. Interestingly, Depp's Tonto emerges as a far more tragic but sympathetic figure than Captain Jack Sparrow. Some of the larger-than-life shenanigans, particularly the agile display of horsemanship atop a fast-moving train, can be attributed to co-scenarists Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. Not only did they write ""The Mask of Zorro,"" but they also penned ""The Legend of Zorro."" Antonio Banderas galloped his black stallion atop a trundling train, too. Elliot and Rossio also wrote ""Alladin,"" ""Small Soldiers,"" and the first three ""Pirates"" movies. A third scenarist, Justin Haythe of ""Snitch"" and ""Revolutionary Road,"" contributed to this sprawling saga. Mind you, Armie Hammer's Lone Ranger is nothing like Clayton Moore's Masked Man. Moore debuted as the eponymous character in the ABC-TV series ""The Lone Ranger"" back in 1949. He wore the mask longer than any other actor. Clayton Moore registered so deeply in the American psyche as the Masked Man that his clash with the copyright holders in 1981 about wearing the mask yielded enough bad publicity to sink ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger."" Apart from the WB Network, the Lone Ranger hasn't fired any silver slugs since 2003. Verbinski and his scribes poke fun at the most important convention of The Lone Ranger: the mask. None of the previous Rangers worried about the mask. Armie Hammer's Lone Ranger feels self-conscious about the mask and doesn't understand its significance. Everybody who encounters the Lone Ranger asks him about the mask.""The Lone Ranger"" opens in San Francisco in 1933. A little boy in a cowboy outfit, hat, vest, mask, and matching cap pistols pays for a ticket to see a Wild West Show. He stares at a number of exhibits, such as the buffalo, and then he meets a replica of a Noble Savage. At this point, in the tradition of the ""Night at the Museum,"" the Indian surprises him and speaks. A wizened Tonto (Johnny Depp of ""Blow"") wears a black bird atop his head and looks like he should be at the Happy Hunting Ground. He recognizes his old partner, the Lone Ranger, and blows the little guy's mind so much that the kid whips out a cap pistol and blasts away. Afterward, Tonto settles down to chronicle the legend of the Lone Ranger. John Reid (Armie Hammer of ""The Social Network"") has acquired a law degree and is returning home to Colby, Texas, to serve as the county prosecutor. At the same time, treacherous railroad executive Lathan Cole (Tom Wilkerson of ""The Green Hornet"") has pulled strings so he can hang one of the most notorious outlaws, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner of ""Heat""), wherever he wants as a warning to other desperadoes. Awaiting the train at the station is John's older brother Dan (James Badge Dale of ""World War Z""). John and Dan's father served with the Texas Rangers. Dan and his wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) watch in horror as the train derails. A huge lever designed to spin the wheels of the locomotive tumbles end-over-end from the sky and narrowly misses our heroes. When we meet the chief villain, Butch Cavendish, this murderer is chained to the floor of a freight car. Tonto sits nearby and watches as the outlaw finds a six-gun stashed under a plank. Cavendish behaves like an unsavory villain. He shoots both of sentries without a qualm. Impetuous John Reid manages to get the drop on him. Nevertheless, Cavendish escapes, and our heroes barely get off the train in time to save themselves. Dan forms a posse and tosses John his father's Texas Rangers badge. Basically, John behaves like every western tin-horn that you've ever seen on the big-screen. Dan's trustworthy scout Collins (Leon Rippy of ""Stargate"") betrays the Rangers and leads them into an ambush. Everybody gets shot to ribbons. The depraved Cavendish turns out to be a cannibal, but he isn't shown chowing down. Meantime, John is shot twice, passes out, and appears dead for all practical purposes. Tonto finds him later and tries to bury him. At one point, a mysterious white stallion materializes and scrapes its hoof across John Reid's Ranger badge. Afterward, Cavendish kidnaps Dan's widow Rebecca and her son Danny. Eventually, Cavendish orders Collins to finish them off.""The Lone Ranger"" occurs against the scenic backdrop of American history during the construction of the transcontinental railroad. The infamous Cavendish and Cole are playing for high stakes. They have struck it rich with silver mine and excavated over $30 million worth of ore. Rather than remain content as a minor railway executive, Cole mounts a hostile takeover of the railway company while orchestrating the annihilation of the Comanche Indian nation. John Reid bumbles along for the first 90 minutes trying to convince himself he can be a man of action. Verbinski pulls out all stops late in this 149 minute melodrama when he stages a chase between two trains. This incredible railway sequence is reminiscent of the unforgettable stunts that silent movie star Buster Keaton pulled off in ""The General."" Finally, near the end of the movie, John Reid understands why he must never remove the mask. He also realizes why he can never have a relationship with Rebecca. As corrupt as society is, the only way to combat this corruption is to be an outlaw. Altogether, despite its titanic length, ""The Lone Ranger"" has no shortage of death-defying exploits or spectacular desert scenery.",The Lone Ranger
19,grantss,Better than expected,7,15 April 2014,"Better than I expected. After all the negative publicity and reviews, I was expecting a join-the-dots standard action-adventure (with great CGI, of course). Basically, style over substance.There is style aplenty. Special effects are great and very convincing.However, there is a good degree of substance too. Plot is good: quite interesting and engaging, especially as it recounts how the Lone Ranger came to be. (The Tonto-in-his-old age scenes add nothing, however, and detracts from the movie. I would have left those out entirely).Dark and edgy too: rather than a simple children-orientated shoot 'em up, it is quite gritty. The villains have substance, and there are a few good twists in the tale.Best of all, it never takes itself too seriously. Among all the action there are plenty of funny, or at least light-hearted, scenes.Good performances by Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer in the lead roles. Pick of the performances, however, goes to WIlliam Fichtner. Hardly recognisable, he is thoroughly convincing as the lead villain: snarling, and pure evil.Good support from Ruth Wilson, Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Wilkinson.",The Lone Ranger

21,neil-476,"Who was that masked man? No, really, who was he?",8,23 August 2013,"Ambushed by the Butch Cavendish gang, John Reid is the sole survivor of a troop of Texas Rangers. Rescued from death by Indian Tonto, he puts on a mask and pursues justice: specifically, against the men who killed his troop.Starting as a radio serial, becoming a cinema serial in 1938, and a hugely successful TV series, this big screen adaptation by the people behind Pirates Of The Caribbean follows a particularly poor effort in 1981.Let me say at the start that this is as much The Lone Ranger as Ben Stiller's Starsky and Hutch was S&H, and Man Of Steel was Superman: that is to say, that while there are many elements which are drawn from the source material, what has been done with them is very much its own thing and does not - indeed, actively seeks not to - capture the heart of the characters as established in previous iterations.This is primarily an action comedy set up as a vehicle for Johnny Depp. Maybe that is enough to put you off - heaven knows, it seems to have put off a lot of the critics - and it is the single feature which drives a wedge between this film and its source material. Which is a shame, because it's not bad once you can get past the fact that The Lone Ranger and Tonto are not Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels.It's not without faults - it's too long, the framing story adds time but nothing else, and it rambles - but it has a decent script, good performances (Armie Hammer, saddled with a Lone Ranger scripted as a bumbling sidekick for Tonto most of the time, has trouble putting his stamp on the character or the movie), it is lovely to look at in the John Ford tradition, Hans Zimmer's score is often beautifully lyrical compared to his usual bombast, and the closing set-piece manages to be exciting, ridiculous and funny all at the same time.And, I admit with no shame at all, when The Lone Ranger finally goes into hero mode and the William Tell Overture fanfare starts, I choked completely.This film is great fun and deserves to be enjoyed.",The Lone Ranger
22,ferguson-6,Bad Trade,6,5 July 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Western genre has always appealed to me. I love the clear division between good and bad. Heroes and Villains face-off and the good guys usually win, thereby protecting those too weak to protect themselves. TV had an impressive string of popular westerns: The Rifleman, Maverick, The Big Valley, Rawhide, Bonanza, and Gunsmoke.One of the most popular got it's start on the radio in 1933: The Lone Ranger. When it hit TV in 1949, the great Clayton Moore donned the mask and badge, accompanied by Jay Silverheels as Tonto. Though they filmed a couple of movies, they were best known on the small screen. Then in 1981, The Legend of the Lone Ranger was released in theatres. It was directed by William Fraker and starred Klinton Spilsbury. If you have never seen it ... Mr. Fraker never directed another movie and Mr. Spilsbury never acted again. Enough said.Thirty-three years later, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and mega-star Johnny Depp have teamed up for a re-imagined Tonto and the Lone Ranger story. Yes, that is the proper order since this is mostly the story of Tonto, told by Tonto, with the camera focused on Tonto (Depp). There is very little respect for the roots of the story, and that's probably because it would not be politically correct these days to have a subservient Comanche following the orders of a masked white man.We first meet an aging Tonto as the ""Noble Savage"" in a 1933 Old West traveling museum. This approach reminds me of the far superior Little Big Man featuring Dustin Hoffman. Tonto proceeds to tell a young boy his version of history. We are never really sure if this is a tall tale or just a commentary on how our memory recalls events solely from our own perspective. Tonto's character is given a full backstory, but John Reid, the square and square-jawed prosecutor who Tonto mentors into becoming the Lone Ranger (played by Armie Hammer) is presented as a naive buffoon. Reid's courageous brother Dan is played by James Badge Dale, and the bad guys are played by Tom Wilkinson (Cole, the train baron), and William Fichtner (Butch Cavendish, the notorious outlaw who wiped out the Rangers).It seems apparent that Verbinski was striving to create the next Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The template is familiar ... lots of action and wise-cracking, replete with the newest caricature in the Johnny Depp repertoire. Though Depp has many critics, I am not one. To me, he is a modern day Red Skelton, and I admire the nuances of his Captain Jack Sparrow, Wily Wonka, Mad Hatter, and of course, Edward Scissorhands. Tonto is another feather in his cap (so to speak) and his decision to base the look on Kirby Sattler's painting ""I Am Crow"" adds a stark look along with fodder for comedy.Many film critics have been bashing the production - some even before the film's release. In this day of full information, we all are aware of the battle between the filmmakers and the studio. The final product does in fact wear the scars of entirely too many writers and budget mismanagement and limitations that come with the Disney brand. What should have been a perfect fit (ultimate good guy Lone Ranger) turned into a jumbled mess at times. The 2 1/2 hour movie easily could have been a full hour shorter. Maybe building two new locomotives worked great for realism, but was tough on the budget. With so few young movie-goers even aware of the Lone Ranger, creative freedom to re-imagine the character makes sense, but making him a klutzy sidekick probably doesn't. So what we get are pre-release headlines telling us the film is a bomb. I find that unfair. It certainly appeared that most of the audience I was part of enjoyed the movie, though there were cracks about how long it was.There are some very impressive segments within the film and having Rossini's William Tell Overture playing over the heart-pounding climax adds a level of fun that most movies don't have. So while I fully agree that the movie is much too long, the script should have been tightened, and more respect paid to the main character, it seems highly likely that the movie will be remembered much more fondly than film critics would have us believe.",The Lone Ranger
23,anaconda-40658,An Insult to Fans of the Show.,2,13 July 2015,"The Lone Ranger (2013): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Armie Hammer, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Wilkinson, William Fichtner: As with The Flintstones and The Dukes of Hazzard here is yet another film that completely misses the mark on the original versions. Those who remember the classic TV show will not be impressed with garbage such as the horse Silver standing in a tree or images of demonic rabbits chowing down scorpions. Armie Hammer dons the black eye mask as the hero whose ranger brother and his horse riding troop is killed in an ambush that Hammer survives. Johnny Depp plays sidekick Tonto with white face paint and a dead bird on his head. This is basically another Captain Jack Sparrow and with that said it's a bad distraction. Helena Bonham Carter seems unnecessary as a woman with an ivory leg who runs a brothel. This leg touts a hidden gun. None of this matters. Tom Wilkinson plays the standard villain who schemes to use the railroads as a means to merge ahead and whatnot and who gives a sh*t. William Fichtner plays a ruthless villain who is one of these idiots who sacrifices his thugs before turning his tail and running. Gore Verbinski is famous for the Pirates of the Caribbean films but he expresses little of that skill here. With Depp this is a pathetic recap with massive action scenes and special effects but in the end this is garbage. When previous material is addressed that audience deserves to be respected while also pitching a new generation. With The Lone Ranger veteran fans deserve the opportunity to use this film as target practice. Score: 2 / 10",The Lone Ranger

I can't believe more folks would rather watch animation than a proper movie.Firstly the scenery in the Wild West and Monument Valley is quite magnificent. Forgotten how splendid it is on the big screen.The story is well crafted which is half the battle. Plot lines come together cleverly and there is enough depth of characters and humor. There is a consistent comic thread that is actually quite laugh out loud funny in parts. The various train sequences are exciting. There is enough politically correct treatment of the Native American decimation and exploitation by greedy silver prospectors and cowboys.The actors are mostly good. Johnny Depp is amusing as Tonto. Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger has a good balance of goofiness and leading man charm. Tom Wilkinson is the requisite villain played by a British actor as only they can do well. The love interest Ruth Wilson was a mistake though. She isn't attractive enough to create a plausible romantic interest for the story and looks older than Armie Hammer.Go watch it - an entertaining well made exciting movie like this one shouldn't be a flop. Despite the length, it's a more enjoyable experience than 'Man of Steel' which was too serious.

26,Wuchakk,The two protagonists win the day in this comedic/dramatic/thrilling Western,7,21 June 2016,"Released in 2013, ""The Lone Ranger"" tells the story of John Reid, the so-called 'lone ranger' (Armie Hammer), and his native companion, Tonto (Johnny Depp). The famous duo seeks to bring the notorious Butch Cavendish to justice (William Fichtner). Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter are on hand in periphery roles.I'm not big on movies that mix unrealistic comedy with drama and eye-rolling action, but ""The Lone Ranger"" surprisingly finds an agreeable balance. What especially makes it work are the two leads: Depp is magnetic and interesting as Tonto while Hammer is likable as the Lone Ranger. The format of the elderly Tonto chronicling events from decades earlier is reminiscent of 1970's ""Little Big Man,"" not to mention the mixed tone. There are also nods to other notable Westerns, like the music straight from 1968's ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" One of the best bits is when the Lone Ranger exuberantly exclaims, ""Hi ho Silver, away!"" to which Tonto responds in a flat voice, ""Don't ever do that again."" Speaking of Tonto, his iconic 'look' (with a stuffed crow on his head) was based on a painting by Kirby Sattler called ""I Am Crow"" (Google it).If you like movies like ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998), the underrated ""The Musketeer"" (2001), the Indiana Jones flicks and the aforementioned ""Little Big Man"" you'll probably appreciate ""The Lone Ranger."" It's superior to any of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flicks IMHO and I find Tonto far more interesting character than Jack Sparrow. The film runs 150 minutes and was shot Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California and Texas.GRADE: B",The Lone Ranger
27,zetes,A true epic and the best blockbuster of the summer of 2013,9,15 July 2013,"It was panned and it flopped, but already you've probably heard a peep of re-appraisal. It'll grow into a shout by the end of the year. This is utterly fantastic. Okay, yes, it's overlong, it's a bit bloated, but, for the most part, it's epic running time is justified. It is the perfect summer movie. It's fun, funny and exciting. It also has a serious side. And it all works. Armie Hammer's Lone Ranger isn't a complex character, but he's charming, very likable and has a fine sense of timing. Johnny Depp seems to be the sticking point for many, and that's understandable. He's adopted this weird persona as a wisecracker in pancake makeup in the past decade, and he's definitely not breaking new ground here. For the most part, though, he is funny and the character of Tonto has a great backstory. The best performances in it come from the villains, especially William Fichtner, who is just vile as a cannibalistic outlaw. There really aren't a ton of action set pieces, but the intro and the climax, both involving trains, are just awesome. Westerns are rare and, because of this film's failure, they'll be even rarer now. This one is a success, though, artistically and a must-see for Western fans.",The Lone Ranger
28,mm-39,By the numbers!,6,5 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger is a by the numbers movie. There are many predictable plot twists in this remake. I saw the whole story and plot twists before they even happened. The bad guy is usually some business guy in collaboration with others. The victim or victims, set ups, and one dimensional characters were predictable. The character whose arc is: this guy is going to get killed off, the other characters who needs help or to be rescued, the comic relief character etc where evident. There is a social message, and lots of cartoon special effects to create a whole story. However, I have seen the by the numbers formula before. Well acted, directed with some great homages to old style spaghetti Westerns. Entertaining but flat. The Lone Ranger is a six stars out of ten. I wonder if the movie makers were trying to make a formulated western in homage for the old serial westerns of days gone by.",The Lone Ranger
29,siderite,There is something very wrong with that horse,8,15 October 2013,"I vaguely remember the Lone Ranger movie from when I was a little boy and I have to say that for a guy with no memory, the William Tell overture, the trademark music of that film, comes really easy to my whistling lips. At that time I was probably just happy to see silly revenge justice being done by a guy in a mask riding a nice horse, with no worries about what reality would be like. The remake manages to be both silly and gravely serious and I have to say that its strength is in no way limited to Johhny Depp's acting.You see, there were a lot of things that needed to either be discarded or explained, like the incredible acrobatics of that white horse, the ridiculous lines and names, the birth of the legend, and yet make it all seem real. And they did it, somehow. Tonto's reaction to ""Hi-yo, Silver! Away!"" was gold, pardon my pun. Same for the reason for choosing the name of the horse, very nicely done.So how did they do it? They combined the apparent silliness of Tonto's character with an incredibly sad and realistic origin story. The Indian shenanigans of boldly attacking into the Gatling gun are accompanied by the tribe's elder knowledge that their time has ended - not unlike the scene in The Last Samurai, although I suspect the real people were not so chivalrous with their own lives. John's out of place behavior, explained by the fact that he comes ""from the city"", is paired with his being forced to betray his principles on account of a very serious and present threat: corporate corruption. I can't seem to shake from my mind the phrase ""Bad trade"", when Tonto's gives the villain back the watch. Maybe we are all trading something. That phrase was counterbalanced by the ending of the film, with the Indian dressed in a suit.As I am writing this review and thinking about it I begin to feel more and more respect for the movie and its makers. A really tough balancing act, done with both taste and good fun. I expected an adventure movie similar to Pirates of the Caribbean, only in the desert, fueled by Depp's penchant for portraying original and funny characters. I am so glad it wasn't just like that.That doesn't mean the movie did not have its flaws. The female character, as so many movies in the history of cinema, is hopelessly helpless. She keeps repeating defiantly ""I told you he would come"" until it becomes as ridiculous as Silver's, err... over the top acting. She starts already attracted to John, even given her situation, so she isn't even a romantic interest to the lead. The ending, when she is practically left in the dust, is equally ludicrous, if not even humiliating.I am also conflicted about Armie Hammer and his character. It seemed to me that an uncharismatic character was played by an equally bland actor. William Fichtner does a very decent job of playing the evil murderer, even if his character is rather inconsistent in his choice of killing or letting live. Helena Bonham Carter has a really tiny role.

But, in terms of Writing, The Screenplay by Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio, could've been stronger & even crispier. Of course, its entertaining & fun at most parts, but the second-hour is loose & the narrative is dragged. The excessive running time of over 145-minutes needed some trimming. Gore Verbinski's Direction is fantastic. He presents this action-adventure with great style. Cinematography is super. Editing isn't crisp. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Make-Up is flawless. Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp is flawless as Tonto. He enacts the central part with amazing confidence. Armie Hammer as John Reid aka The Lone Ranger, delivers a heroic performance. Also, The on-screen chemistry between Depp & Hammer throughout, is perfect. Ruth Wilson is fine. William Fichtner, Tom Wilkinson & Barry Pepper are fantastic as the villains.

32,DKosty123,Mystery of Masked Man With Confused Horse,7,4 July 2013,"First of all, I was not sure of what to expect when you try to reboot a classic that really if from another era. When you put Jerry Bruckheimer, Disney and Johnny Depp together, you get something not expected. Here it is and really there is some good stuff and some excess stuff.I nominate ""Silver"" for best acting performance.There is no doubt a lot of sentiment used to try and recreate an American Classic here. The trouble is in my mind coming up with a plot to hang it together. Using the theme of the railroad's conquering the west is what holds this one up. It has a family like quality that is hard to preserve in today's market and skims along a border of being tame and being spirited.This movie does not do it badly. At times the action almost loses the viewer trying to follow the plot. Still, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown into the stunts, it works.If I could re-cut the film with less of the old Tonto and little kid at the museum it would make the length a little better. There is a special majesty to hearing the classic Lone Ranger them in stereo surround sound. Love the sound and the music is used at exactly the right time. Johnny Depp is great though his makeup is way over done. Even so, this is fun.This film does not take itself too seriously and really that is correct. The recent reboot of Superman - Man Of Steel- got way too serious - where this one keeps a balance between humor and action that is inviting. It even waits until the big action sequence to pull out the stops of the classic Lone Ranger theme music.This is not a film in which you want too think, it is a light Saturday afternoon popcorn movie. It works that way. The Lone Ranger was never rocket science. It was entertainment. That is what this one is.",The Lone Ranger

The masked ranger was something more like a western superhero than a cowboy which made the old TV show quite enjoyable for a non-western fan. This is why I was excited about The Lone Ranger film - they finally brought John Reid (Lone Ranger)and Tonto back after all these years! This is a good drama film with quite a bit of comedy thrown in. It's a pretty good action and adventure film that the entire family can enjoy - one that I can enjoy re-watching again.I would have rated this film 9/10 but because The Lone Ranger has not been touched in a long time, I had to rate the film a 10/10.",The Lone Ranger
34,KineticSeoul,"Well it's better than ""Wild Wild West""",5,4 July 2013,"The trailers didn't impress me but it is still a very disappointing movie because of how boring of a watch it is. Nothing about this movie made it seem special or stand out in any manner. Most of the way through is the Lone Ranger's build up of how a lawyer named John Reid(Armie Hammer) becomes the Lone Ranger. But it doesn't show much of how the Lone Ranger utilizes his secret identity and skills to take down the bad guys except near the very end. In fact most of the way through this naive John Reid came off more annoying than likable. Tonto(Johnny Depp) is this Comanche native that wants revenge but has a mellow demeanor about it. In another words he reminded me of a very sober Jack Sparrow. And is trying to back up the Lone Ranger and tries to help build him up. But the thing is the development for these two leads is weak, including the chemistry as well. This movie is about 2 hours and a half of build ups but the delivery after the build up isn't satisfying. Nothing about it was emotionally gripping or attention grabbing. In fact this whole movie is actually quite forgettable. I guess the message had a slight impact but it just seemed to be so focused on the message that it forgot to make a entertaining movie. Kids will probably fall asleep watching this bore fest of a movie. None of the characters stand out and is forgettable. And what is up with the older Tonto telling the story to a boy about the Lone Ranger and their quest? It just seemed irrelevant and drag the story down without adding anything to the experience. Plus it got rid of chances for a sequel not that I would want one. If it did leave a impact I wouldn't say anything but it simply doesn't. Live action Disney movies tend to have childish slapstick comedy mixed in with over the top and ridiculous stuff going on which is fine since it's a movie the whole family is suppose to enjoy. But the constant over perfect timing scenes and the most incompetent bad guys ever makes it kinda annoying at times. You know when those bad guys that can just shoot the good guys and be done with. But just points the gun at the good guys and bides his/her time until the good guys find a way to escape or make a reverse and end up killing the bad guys instead. Yeah, you will see plenty of those moments in this one. This movie has a budget of around 250 million dollars going for it but I don't really see it unless most of it went to Johnny Depp. Who put on a redundant performance. Overall this is a boring movie of the summer that might be worth a rent but nothing more.5.5/10",The Lone Ranger
35,Hellmant,"I'm a big fan of Depp, as well as Verbinski, but I was disappointed in this film.",6,4 July 2013,"'THE LONE RANGER': Three Stars (Out of Five)The first 'Lone Ranger' film in 32 years is a retelling of the character's origins, narrated by his Native American companion Tonto. Rising star Armie Hammer plays the legendary masked hero and superstar Johnny Depp headlines the film as his sidekick Tonto (marking the first time the actor playing Tonto has ever received top billing, in any medium). The film is a reteaming of Depp with his 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' director Gore Verbinski and two of the co-writers of each film in that franchise (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) also co-wrote this film (with Justin Haythe). It's of course an adaptation of the classic 1930's radio show (which has been adapted into film multiple times before, as well as a popular TV series, books and comic books). I grew up watching 'THE LONE RANGER' movies and TV show and this is definitely a different take on it. I'm a big fan of Depp, as well as Verbinski, but I was disappointed in this film. The film begins in 1930's San Francisco when a young boy, named Will (Mason Elston Cook), comes across an elderly Tonto (Depp), posing as a mannequin, at a Wild West exhibition. Tonto tells the boy he's a Comanche spirit warrior that used to fight alongside the legendary 'Lone Ranger'. He then proceeds to tell him how he recruited an ordinary lawyer, named John Reid (Hammer), and helped him realize his true calling as the famous masked hero. He tells Will how he met Reid on a train headed towards Texas, while he was being held captive on it, that was also carrying the outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Butch was on his way to his hanging when he escaped. Tonto was trying to carry out his revenge on Butch when John intervened and Butch was freed by his gang. The train was then derailed and Tonto was taken back into custody by Mr. Reid. Tonto escaped his imprisonment yet again and came across Reid in the desert, after he and his brother, Dan Reid (James Badge Dale, who's popping up in every blockbuster this summer; this as well as 'IRON MAN 3' and 'WORLD WAR Z'), we're ambushed there and left for dead. Dan was killed but Tonto was able to revive John as he realized John's true calling as an immortal hero of justice. He then enlisted his help tracking down Butch.The film has received atrocious reviews from critics and been compared to other huge box office failures like ('AFTER EARTH' and 'JOHN CARTER'), given it's hefty price tag of a $250 million budget, but it's box office performance is yet to be seen (analysts are projecting a big disappointment though). I still went into the film with an open mind, I loved 'AFTER EARTH' and 'JOHN CARTER' despite what critics said about them, but this film is just a huge misfire. It's a mess on so many levels and above all it's just really dull (for most of it's running time). It's overly long and drawn out (at 2 hours and 30 minutes) and severely miscast. I love Johnny Depp but casting an actual 'full-blooded' Native American (or at least 'half-blooded') would have been a much wiser thing to do. He's good in the film and gives it his all but the part is not especially well written and he has to deliver a lot of really lame jokes. Hammer's part is even more poorly written though and he's just the wrong actor for the role. Hammer would have been perfectly cast in the same role, playing it exactly like he does in this film, if it were a spoof (but not in a serious adaptation). The supporting cast is all good enough but Verbinski's directing is too self indulgent (at least 30 minutes should have been trimmed). The film does have a lot of cool scenes and visuals but it could have been so much better and the characters deserve a better film adaptation.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMJBjPRxAc",The Lone Ranger
36,bowmanblue,"Not as bad as the critics said, but flawed nonetheless",6,18 July 2014,"'The Lone Ranger' isn't about the Lone Ranger. It's the first version of the popular western to give the Lone Ranger's sidekick, Tonto, top-billing. But then he's played by Johnny Depp, so it's hardly surprising. And that's where the first anomaly begins...If you heard the press coverage of the film on its cinematic release, you could be forgiven for thinking it's the worst film ever made. It isn't. But that's not to say it's a classic either. The critics were overly harsh, dwelling on budget problems rather than storyline issues. However, although what's there is good, it's also a bit odd.As I mentioned, the 'sidekick' is basically given more screen time than the hero. Plus the two of them didn't seem to have that much of a rapport throughout the film. Johnny Depp sort of plays Jack Sparrow, but in a clichéd Red Indian accent while he's on screen. If you asked me to sum up the film in one word, I'd say 'long.' It felt like it was way too long for its own good. At least half an hour could have been trimmed out of it. The special effects are good where the sets are concerned, but, despite its hefty budget, some of the 'horse scenes' and bluescreen work looked decidedly ropey.If anyone deserves a positive mention it's William Fichtner, who plays the villain well. However, if you set your expectations a bit lower than you may expect for a 'blockbuster' of this scale, you should get some fun out of it. I certainly didn't hate the film, but it isn't what the producers hoped it to be, i.e. the start of the next Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. I can't see The Lone Ranger spawning three sequels (to date). So, if you're looking for a few good lines from Johnny Depp and plenty of action, stick with it - the last twenty minutes rock (basically when the Lone Ranger music finally starts to play). If only the rest of the film could have been as good as the ending, it may have got less of a mauling at the box office.",The Lone Ranger
37,MLDinTN,a wild west comedy adventure,7,8 April 2014,"This movie was better than I expected since I knew it had gotten a lot of bad press when it was in theaters. However, it turned out to be pretty good. The film was written to be a comedy and it was sort of funny. I don't remember anything about the TV show and if it was funny. The story is about Tonto telling his tale to a little kid. We see how he met the Ranger and how he never wanted to kill anyone. Then the escape of the bad guy and chasing him throughout the film. Tonto was just in the film to be funny. He says the wrong brother lived and feeding a dead bird, just silly stuff.

38,g-bodyl,A Really Fun Western!,9,7 October 2014,"Many members of the film community will loathe me for this review, but I actually think the Lone Ranger was a fun summer blockbuster and it deserves more credit than it has received. I was drawn in by the story and the story was elevated by great acting, taking place in a Western setting, a good script, non-stop action featuring crazy stunts, a good Hans Zimmer score, and great special effects. Sure it was a little drawn out and the second half was choppy, but as summer blockbusters go, this film works.Gore Verbinksi's film is based on the old property of the Lone Ranger. This film talks about the origins of Tonto's and John Reid's relationship as they band up to avenge the death of Reid's brother and stop a railroad tycoon from taking over the railroad company.This film is actually well-acted. I liked Johnny Depp's offbeat character, Tonto. I was vastly reminded at times of his Jack Sparrow character from the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but there is enough difference between the characters that we can tell them apart. Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger/John Reid was great, and he furthers his acting from the days of the Social Network. The main villains are a trio of Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, and William Fichtner and they do a very good job.Overall, the Lone Ranger is not the awful movie everyone has been claiming it to be. Sure there are flaws, but this is a mostly enjoyable film. There are many action scenes, but they are put to good use. The trailers made this film to be a dumb train movie, and while trains are a main setting, this film is much more than that. I feel sad this movie was under-appreciated and bombed at the box office. Not only was the acting and action great, so was the visuals, makeup, score, and script. The near-perfect summer blockbuster. Too bad people are not big fans of Westerns anymore. I rate this film 9/10.",The Lone Ranger

One other reason is the preview made it look slap-sticky and campy and nothing that I thought looked good. Even with those low expectations this movie wasn't all that good. There were some pretty funny parts and I did laugh throughout but this is really only a one time watch at most.

I mean, really, since when is Monument Valley in Texas? And that's just one of the most obvious faults of the film.And the management at Disney -- the company you built from scratch. Where the hell were they while this disaster was being made? Wasn't there anyone there bright enough to say, ""Hey, is there any way that we can turn around a film that (with advertising) is going to cost us in the neighborhood of $375 million? And it's so dumb, won't word of mouth sink the film, thus preventing anything but a financial disaster?"" And then there were the actors. Starting with Johnny Depp. Walt, can't you telepathically communicate with Johnny and tell him that he's 50 years old now? Time to grow up and try real acting instead of just playing in the equivalence of a video game. There was a time, Walt, when I felt that Depp was turning into one of the best of the actors in his generation. But that was a decade ago. And since then, many of his characterizations have been akin to cartoon characters. In fact, in this film, his character (Tonto) is participating in a film that isn't much more than a series of cartoon absurdities that you find in the average Roadrunner cartoon (meep, meep); but that kind of plot works in a 6 or 7 minute cartoon...but not in a 149 minute movie. And Armie Hammer...will anyone want to go to another movie in which he stars? I doubt it. And how did they convince Tom Wilkinson to lower himself to this level????? Walt, I think you ought to rise up and haunt the people that operate Disney studios until they drop your name from the corporation, because what they do now is so far beneath you.Do you know what the trouble is, Walt? A big part of it is being obsessed with special effects, rather than good scripts and fine acting. They just throw together a series of special effects, slap in some transitions that don't really work, and think they have a story. They really ought to read the biography that came out about you recently and learn what a quest for quality is really about.So again, sorry it has come to this Walt.

It features a plot that fits together like a jigsaw puzzle. Great attention is paid to detail and the production values are great, the special effects credible.It also has a point of view--one that is consistent with historical fact, though a work of fiction.This origination story, which reveals how John Reid became the Lone Ranger and sets up the myth (accompanied by the iconic William Tell Overture) for future stories, is a recounting of the legend by Tonto, as an old man, to a young boy. Reid becomes the hero through the guidance of Tonto and learns some real-world lessons along the way. There is no shortage of villains, including one super-villain who embodies all that is evil, including the base dishonesty that was the myth of Manifest Destiny.The story is truer to the history of the American West (in spirit) than the hogwash taught students in American schools in past decades.

If I skipped everything critics tried to destroy I would miss a bunch of excellent movies.They say it's not accurate. Accurate to what?! It is not a historical movie and it's not a remake. The old one was a Western classic and this one is an adventure/comedy. They criticize the quality of the screenplay and acting. Sure, no one could get an Oscar for it, but it was not the intention of this movie. This is Disney adventure with the goal to entertain, not to be Nobel prize level literature or Oscar contestant. But what shocked me the most was an argument that appeared in several negative reviews. They said this movie is essentially a Western version of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" as if it were a bad thing!!! For God's sake, in what universe this could be shortcoming?!

44,tabuno,An Unbalanced Western Tone of Humor and Serious Drama,7,16 January 2019,"4 July 2013. This is no television version of The Lone Ranger and as a result it while gorgeous to look at and the wonderful humor from Johnny Depp came out in bundles, it was the raw, harsh violence that seemed to throw the movie's tone off balance through out the movie. Perhaps Depp was miscast for this movie, using the Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) motif too well for a movie that wasn't Pirates of the Caribbean. Or perhaps it was the rest of the script of The Lone Ranger that let Depp down and instead of writing the movie around Depp in the role of Tonto which he excelled, it was if the rest of this dark dramatic Western with attempts a glib humor couldn't hold up to him.While the storyline was decent with its expected, usually predictable twists, there were those technical or logical weaknesses, like the unusual lengthy pause in the ambush when the last Ranger was shot that didn't seem natural nor the unusual rapidity with which the bad guys showed up afterward or later when the Lone Ranger's teeth seemed more suited for a Superman's character than a Western city prosecutor. The flashback storybook technique in The Longer Ranger while again decent enough wasn't as smooth and stylish as even that in The Princess Bride (1987).The Lone Ranger presents a rather unique set of theatrical dilemmas in this day and age of super-heroes with their super powers and in this version of The Lone Ranger, it was difficult to distinguish between city slicker suddenly becoming a gun-slinging Ranger or some Native American mystical occurrence. And the serious and substantive dramatic moral issues with respect to Indians presented later in the movie that resembled and more effectively presented in Dances with Wolves (1990) wasn't quite the smoothly blended topic incorporated into The Lone Ranger with its more wry humor and hero nature of the movie. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock played off which over well in the action thriller Speed (1994) or even Sylvester Stallone and again Sandra Bullock meshed both lighter drama, action, humor in the balanced toned The Demolition Man (1993). Perhaps Pierce Brosnan as an aging assassin was also given a balanced dramatic, comedy, thriller role in The Matador (2005) or John Malkovich was given a script that excelled at the balance between comedy and serious biting drama in as a eccentric Magician in The Great Howard Buck (2008). Even the cult classic Pulp Fiction (1994) dwelt with its dramatic violence in a way that didn't intrude on the more humorous lightness in the movie. Somehow the lightness and the darkness the create a wonderful composite of color in Robert Downey's version of Sherlock Holmes (2008) while there is a persistent dissonance with Johnny Depp's Tonto and his surrounding environment, events, and characters.As for the legend, fairy tale nature of this Western movie, This version of The Lone Ranger seemed out of place and somewhat lost in the rocky formations of southern Utah.",The Lone Ranger
45,ironhorse_iv,"Hi, ho Silver away from this movie! It's not that great. It's mediocre. Ke-mo sah-bee.",6,13 July 2013,"You know something is wrong with the film when the actor that portray Tonto get more screen time and gets top billing than the actor portraying the Lone Ranger in a film titled 'The Lone Ranger'. It was pretty much the Johnny Depp's bizarre outlandish character show. It felt like the Western version of the Pirates of the Caribbean with Director Gore Verbinski and Depp teaming up again. While it's beautifully shot with breathtaking action set-pieces, and panoramic Western vistas. The film tries too hard to do both Great Comedy and Great Drama, with mixed results, all too often throwing us out of the story. Depp carry the film doing shtick in clown face paint, rather than tell the story of The Lone Ranger in my opinion. The film even opens up with Tonto at an 1933 San Francisco World Fair talking to some kid about his time in the Old West with the Lone Ranger. This whole discussion narrator scene wasn't need in this movie and could have been deeply delete. The mystical/unreliable narrator elements make me want to watch it again to try and make better sense of it. I think they were trying to hint that this was a story an old Indian was telling a kid and no one knows whether it was true or not. It's seems like 'Tonto' the movie with Lone Ranger playing second fiddle. For a 2 hour movie, we got Tonto acting so not like Tonto from the ABC's 1950 TV Show and radio program. He is bargaining for peanuts, feeding a dead bird, playing a lot of sight gags, and jokes. While some people might hate that Depp is portraying a Native American. I don't see a problem with it. He is part Native American after all. It just seems like he was mocking Native Americans in this film. Still, he was pretty entertaining and funny. At less, Tonto had more back-story than the Lone Ranger. The film should have started in 1869 in Colby, Texas with the title character, John Reid AKA Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) coming to join this brother into hunting famous cannibal outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Butch Cavendish looks and acts like a bad Jonah Hex character who eats his victim heart out. He might be scary, if only the film didn't give him stupid jokes scenes and talking villain syndrome. William Fitchner is better than this. While the movie sticks to the original story, where Butch Cavendish ambush Lone Ranger's group and killed all of them and left him out for death. It doesn't continue any further than that. Rather than keeping the story, that Tonto and Lone Ranger are friends that the Indian recognizes the lone survivor as the man who saved his life as a boy. We get Lone Ranger and Tonto arguing and fighting against each other over nothing. It was embarrassing to watch these characters be so mean to each other. Not only that, Lone Ranger is played like a buffoon. The Lone Ranger is an idealistic sissy play for laughs rather than the strong hero. Very frustrating. Where are Lone Ranger's morals? The character original creators Fran Striker and George W. Trendle drew up the following guidelines that embody who and what the Lone Ranger is and this movie didn't follow any of it. Example: Lone Ranger robbing a bank, and taking off his mask. What? This was sad Lone Ranger. While Armie Hammer showed comedic chops at the right time, while showing a heroic persona aided by his physical presence. His wooden performance was indeed an acting job and bad. They even made the William Tell overture into a cartoony joke. The shenanigans in the final train sequence were idiotic and people were doing ridiculous things for no reason. The bodily harm don't even makes sense. Lone Ranger and Tonto can survive outlandish stunts while other people can't. The action scenes were good, but they add way too much comedy into it to the point that the story progression slow. The scenes don't really match up. Surprising for a Disney movie, this movie features not only murders, but butchering, and cannibalism. It's got adultery, grave robbing and betrayal. Several times the main character abandons his partner to die. Then, there is mass murder and genocide and in the end it empowers children to use guns and having a bullet is a great souvenir. They even got an evil rabbit. This is all shown with bit of silly comedy. Director Gore Verbinski was really pushing the levels of what they can show in a kid's Disney movie. The film could have edit down. It looks like it badly edit, with missing scenes like how Tonto escape from the jail. Then there were scenes that didn't make any sense, like shots of the horse on a pine tree and bowl hat bird hat for some odd reason to get laughs. The film was plagued with production problems and budgetary concerns. Sadly to hear the movie bomb at the box office, but I can understand why. Overall: This movie was okay, but I am sorry to say it has nothing on the original TV series. Old though it may be, I still watched it when I was a kid. I wouldn't say that 1985's The Legend of the Lone Rangers is that good, too. If you do stick during the credits, without spoiling it, they do show something, but it might not be worthwhile and pointless. There is nothing after the credits. There was no paid off for this film. If somehow they do make sequels to this film. Please, please make them better than this movie.",The Lone Ranger
46,slightlymad22,Pleasantly Surprised,7,23 March 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to The Lone Ranger.Before watching this movie today, I only knew a few things about it!! It had a troubled production, the studio interfered a lot, critics ripped it apart and it is one of the biggest financial flops of all time, allegedly losing the studio about 100million dollars. Reading up on it, it really was a troubled production. The problems included bad weather, wildfire, a chickenpox outbreak, and the accidental death of a crew member. These problems and the spirally budget almost led to the film's cancelation. Until Depp, Gore Verbinski, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Armie Hammer equally deferred twenty percent of their salaries, to minimize the overall cost. Disney then changed chairmen and the new chairman became very hands on including editing parts of the movie himself!! Depp was apparently very unhappy that most of the Native American subplot was axed all together!! On to the movie. I actually quite enjoyed it. To say I was pleasantly surprised, is an understatement, as I was not looking forward to watching this one. I asked my brother about it this morning, and he compared it to Waterworld saying ""It's one of those movies people will like in 20 years time, when they watch it away from all of the hate"" and I kind of get what he means!! It's not a great movie by any stretch. It's predictable, formulaic and it's all standard stuff, but it is certainly not a bad movie, I have seen a lot worse. I was entertained throughout and I laughed/chuckled and smiled more at this, than I did the recent Game Night. In fact I enjoyed this more than Jumanji!! I'm sure not many will share that thought though lol.Depp was criticised for A, not being Native American (there is Native American blood on his grandmothers side) and for acting too much like Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see where the last criticism is coming from, but I think he is more like Sam from Benny & Joon, then Captain Jack. I do have a few criticisms too!! A busty Helena Bonham Carter is on my dvd cover, but is only in two scenes!! I hate that!! Armies Hammer is devoid of any charisma and the twist was pretty obvious from quite early too!! But I was entertained throughout and not Johnny Depp openly criticized the reviews by American critics. Depp said ""the reviews were written seven to eight months before we released the film. They were reviewing the budget, not reviewing the movie."" The Lone Ranger grossed $89 million at the domestic box office to end 2013 as the 40th highest grossing movie of the year!!",The Lone Ranger

48,Reno-Rangan,Depp's another weird costume movie and worked perfectly,7,16 October 2013,"Another movie where Johnny Depp appeared in a weird costume. The weirder he goes the wildest his role becomes, I love it. No question, he is one of a rare actor who try a variety of characters in different movies. His appearance as an American Indian with a stuffed crow over his head was the highlight of this movie.The story is set in 1930 where a tale was told to a young boy about the famous Ranger, John Reid, of the past era. Slowly the screen turns the mid 1800 where John Reid loses his brother. He teams up with a native American to bring the justice to his brother's death. But the law was powerless against his enemy. He's forced to take the alternate path and how he accomplishes his quest are the rest.The characters were not developed up to the standards. Tonto was okay but the Ranger was not, in fact the title represents that Ranger character only. This, Indian and Ranger combo was looked similar kinda combo to Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson's 'Shanghai Noon'. Worked perfectly into the movie but I don't know how comprehensive to the 38 and 56 versions.Overall movie was not great but definitely above average and one can thoroughly enjoy it. The movie had all the elements that a western should have like horse riding, gold rush, desert train, Indians, cowboys and what else. In my opinion Johnny Depp saved the movie, any others in his place could have been a great mess.7/10",The Lone Ranger

The ground breaking one of a kind, twice weekly, cliff-hanger episodes skillfully created an audience of all ages.THE EARLIEST OF installments, in particular, got over with everyone due to a combination of good writing, excellent casting and by striking a balance between the action and the humor generated by the melodramatic, super-serious situations it portrayed.ALTHOUGH THE SERIES was pigeon-holed as being ""Camp"" humor, we must disagree. True ""Camp"" consists of what is unintentionally funny. BATMAN was carefully crafted and once again, in the early episodes, the laughs were generated by exaggerated serious situations.AS FOR THIS 2013 production of THE LONE RANGER, its roots are neither to be found in ""Camp"" nor in exaggeration. We found the over all effect to be disrespectful, crude and sophomoric. The production team has neither any sympathy for the subject matter nor for their audience.THE MOVIE EITHER is an over expanded sort of Saturday NIGHT LIVE spoof or a old MAD MAGAZINE type lampoon of The Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone.IT SURELY IS not any semblance of THE LONE RANGER that we all knew and loved.

50,Dr_Coulardeau,Finally out of tunnel vision,10,10 August 2013,"An important et essential film on the Conquest of the West and the Indians in Texas after the Civil War et around the transcontinental railroads. The Indians finally get a fair image in this film. They are no longer the wild people, sorry animals that were depicted for so long. In fact this unacceptable image is completely put upside down and thus the truth is recaptured.The truth is that some people were ready to make a profit, and even a fortune, by all means available. There were some idealists in DC offices that were speaking of progress, humanity, good and happiness for people, etc. But in the field that was a completely different picture. Some who had power were ready to exploit workers building the railroads, essentially Chinese, as if they were slaves without the ""title."" In real life people were not shot dead when resisting, they were the victims of sorry accidents and a silver dollar was given to the widows. These people who had power in the railroad companies, and other industries, were ready to use all those who could impose work for a pittance with violence, brutal violence if necessary, guns and gunshots, if not manipulated and rigged accidents. Who was going to ask questions about dead Chinese?The Indians were in the way. So they were exterminated with the cavalry if necessary who always shot first and asked questions from the Whites about the Indians second. Or they were starved to death by the extermination of all buffaloes by people like Buffalo Bill. Or they were pushed away and locked up in reservations. All kinds of treacherous actions were possible including using outlaws disguised as Indians to attack some farmers and start a war.Add to the phenomenal profits that were to come from the railroads the fact that they found some natural resources that were worth fortunes, in this case silver and you have the magic potion that can turn the most honest and law-abiding clerk into the most aggressive criminal.But the film is also clear about the fact that all people were not like that and there were some who did believe in progress, humanity and the ""government of the people for the people by the people"" and were able to resist the hooligans who were at the head of such industrial ventures, including some women and some children, on both sides actually.When you remember the Pocahontas films who defended a myth of colonial history in Virginia, you can measure the distance that has been run by Walt Disney with this film that is honest and presented in such a way, with such special effects and with no lackluster scene or slowing down so that the interest is constantly at its maximum. Hence the film is perfect for a young audience in the summer that wants entertainment, and yet educational too. The decolonialization, or mental decolonization, of Indians in the USA is now well on the road to success. And it all started in Alcatraz in 1969. We may not be able to redo history, but we are able to correct it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Lone Ranger
51,eddie_baggins,A movie that doesn't know what it wants to be,4,17 November 2013,"The Lone Ranger is rock solid proof that a big budget does not a good movie make. Criticism has actually been thrown back to those that looked upon the budget and production of this film and took it apart and whilst this is somewhat unfair The Lone Ranger's problems do seem to extend from a lot of cash for horses, trains and explosions and not a whole lot of thought about how to construct a good and involving story, for while trying to appeal to many masters The Lone Ranger ends up mastering none.Unsure of whether it wants to be a comedy (drunk horses anyone?), an action driven movie (there is one high body count for a Disney movie), a dark prose of the white man/Indian time of America (witness a sad little Tonto in his burnt down village) or a mismatched buddy comedy (Depp and Hammer have a somewhat unique bond here) The Lone Ranger's tone shifts far too many times throughout it's bloated 140 minute plus runtime to ever feel cohesive. This lack of a film soul really works against the film, as many times one will wonder why on earth one scene has happened to the next and an abundance of characters coming and going only increases the feeling that too many voices had a say in the writing process. Criticising the film in this way only increases the letdown feeling one gets, due to some elements of the film that promise a much better picture.Director Gore Verbinski certainly knows his way around an action set piece, and The Lone Ranger has many commendable such moments that made his original Pirates of the Caribbean such a joy. It is in the more practical and stunt driven scenes where this again shines, while the seriously suspect CGI works against some of the more overwrought and downright cheesy action scenes (horse on a burning barn roof anyone?). Some scene stealing supporting actors such as William Fichtner and James Badge Dale also seem to come from a much better film. In regards to the leads, Depp has his moments although his shtick is wearing somewhat thin, and Hammer doesn't really get out of first gear with his supposed hero and one feels in the end he was miscast in his first leading man duties.I really wanted to like and enjoy The Lone Ranger, but not once did I ever feel truly entertained by the picture that so clearly wanted to be the Wild West version of Pirates of the Caribbean. Upon conclusion one gets the sense that somewhere out there in this wide world of ours there was a much better and more productive way to spend 200 million dollars.2 dead crows out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Lone Ranger

THE BONE RANGER is yet another of those overblown westerns set needlessly in a cgi world (like the remakes of 3:10 TO YUMA and TRUE GRIT, as well as JONAH HEX). While it boasts impressive production values (higher production values would be hard to imagine), its story is definitely of the Special Needs variety. Shot twice, the titular hero never so much as flinches: he simply dusts himself off and proceeds to the next ludicrous special effects sequence (which doesn't surprise: the dumbbell chosen to play the ranger has all the thespic skills of a side of rotting beef). Cavendish is a cannibal, now, eh? Could the makers of this monstrosity have screened Depp's earlier (and far superior) DEAD MAN (in which Lance Henrickson plays a cowboy cannibal)...? And we're supposed to buy the ranger's identity theft (or the notion that he's a f***ing LAWYER)?

53,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,3,20 February 2016,"To be honest, Depp could do better. Way better than this movie. The movie is a Western maybe for kids. The story is okay, with enough action and some twists here and there that keep the film interesting for a while, though the romance was weak and probably non existing. The kid did add some flavour to it, and some parts were funny, but it felt like sometimes they were trying too hard to make it entertaining and thrilling. The ending was nice and the costumes were realistic for the best part. But still, even with the action scenes, the movie felt more like it was made for kids rather than a movie for all ages. The performances, lastly, were okay, Depp did what he knows to do best, reminded a little of Charlie and the Chocolate factory meet the pirates. So, 3 out of 10.",The Lone Ranger
54,leonblackwood,Witty and full of action 7/10,7,8 December 2013,"Review: I actually really enjoyed this movie. After all of the bad press and the amazing huge budget, I wasn't expecting much, but i really liked Johnny Depp's character, who made the movie, and the storyline wasn't that bad. The last half an hour went a bit too far, but the rest of the movie was entertaining and funny in parts. There wasn't any reason to put that huge action scene near the end, which was pretty unrealistic, but the director done a good job. I think that the leading character should have been someone in the same calibre as Johnny Depp, but he still done a good job, even though I haven't heard of him before. The director could have taken out quite a few scenes to make it shorter, but it's definitely worth a watch.Round-Up: This movie wouldn't have been as good if Johnny Depp wasn't in it, who put in a brilliant performance. The budget was way over the top and you can tell that a lot of movie was spent on the over the top action scene near the end, but I'm glad that it made its money back. It was good to see Ruth Wilson, the weird woman out of Luther, in a leading role, which she played quite well. Tom Wilkinson and William Fichnter also put in great performances, but Johnny Depp stood out from the rest. I hope that they make a sequel.Budget: $215million (WOW!)

Sure, the scenes from the 1930's don't work as well as they should have but the rest of the movie is excellent. The jokes are funny and the action is well staged and exciting. The cast is top-notch, especially Johnny Depp. Depp gives a great performance as he does his best Buster Keaton. It's always a good sign when a longish movie feels short. The first time I saw ""The Lone Ranger"" was in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY). I've seen it quite a few times since. It never fails to hit the spot.",The Lone Ranger
56,l_rawjalaurence,Good Intentions but Poorly Executed,5,30 January 2014,"One can understand where director Gore Verbinski wanted to go with this movie. Rather than pay homage to the television and film series of the past, he wanted to use the story to make a comment on the status of Native Indians, and how their cultures were brutally extinguished by the seemingly endless tide of 'progress,' symbolized by the railway. In this new world of capitalism, concepts of 'good' and 'evil' didn't really hold sway; money was all that mattered. This helps to explain why Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) wield such power in this world. The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) and Tonto (Johnny Depp), might still be able to right wrongs, and restore some kind of moral order, but their influence on the wider picture is negligible. They represent a long-departed world of honor, good fellowship and justice - values that simply do not exist in the capitalist world-view. However many of these very important thematic points are lost in a film which is structurally a mess; it doesn't know whether it is trying to be a comedy, an historical drama, an homage to the television series, or all three. The plot meanders along at a snail's pace, and although there are some spectacular CGI-generated sequences, the characterization remains at a superficial level. Depp gives his usual flashy performance as Tonto; one might argue that it is a good example of mimicry, prompting us to ask why the role was not played by a Native Indian. Hammer is colorless as the Lone Ranger; in truth, Depp might have been better suited to this role. Wilkinson gives his usual scene-stealing role as the bad guy, although he is really only reprising the role of Pecksniff from MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT, with an American accent added.",The Lone Ranger
57,southdavid,"The Mad, The Bad and the Tedium",4,11 April 2018,"Little late to the party on this one, I accept, but maybe the TV experience will be slightly kinder than the harsh glare of the cinema screen on this notorious flop from a few years back. The answer.... not really. It's still an overlong, vaguely racist, horribly predictable, second rate action-adventure. Armie Hammer plays John Reid a pacifist district attorney who joins his brother's posse to help track down notorious murdered Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and his gang. When the posse is betrayed, Reid's brother is killed and he is left for dead. He's restored by Silver, a Native American spirit horse and Tonto (Johnny Depp) who then forms a reluctant partnership with Reid and in going after Cavendish, they discover a larger conspiracy. There are a couple of reasons why ""The Lone Ranger"" doesn't really work. Much of the blame was landed at Johnny Depp's feet, as this was right around the time opinion turned on him and to be fair, much of that here is justified. Though spending some of the running time in awful ""old man"" make up doesn't help, the film never really settles on who ""Tonto"" is. At times he's possessing ""native"" insight and wisdom, at others he blunders around taking pratfalls and ""feeding"" the dead crow on his head, sadly, most of the time, he's just irritating.But those tonal problems roll out to the rest of the film too. It veers wildly between high farce and mild horror. Various scenes of slaughtered Indian Villages, and of Cavendish removing and eating Reid's brother's heart don't mesh well with the ladder riding pratfalls of the films climactic scenes. There are odd character choices too, such as the decision to make Reid in love with his brother's wife. . as if somehow he wouldn't be as motivated to save his brothers widow and his nephew if he wasn't also in in love with her. The reveal of the extra villain at the end was very underwhelming, if you can't work it out from the names on the poster, then you really haven't seen enough movies. The final action scene is a really good one, with a train split into several carriages that then traverses numerous crossing tracks that are (inexplicably) all going in the same direction, but unfortunately it's too little, too late, to justify the horrendous running time.",The Lone Ranger
58,Vartiainen,Pirates of the Caribbean in the Wild West,8,5 April 2014,"The team behind the Pirates of the Caribbean turns its attention to Wild West and brings back to life one of the most beloved western pulp heroes, The Lone Ranger. And what we end up getting is gorgeous imagery, amazing action scenes, intense drama and all-around great entertainment.I have no idea why this film has gotten such bad rep. Because it's not a bad film. I'd even call it great, after its own fashion. Rarely have I seen a western movie with such high production values. Every single shot is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The costuming, the locations, the CGI, it all works so well. Furthermore, the acting is up to par, the script, while a bit long and convoluted, has that good adventure charm to it and the themes addressed are interesting and given enough room to sink in. And the action is just phenomenal. The final chase scene on train tracks is one of the best I've ever seen. I kept repeating in my head: ""This is supposed to be one of the worst movies of 2013? Are they blind!?""Though, to be fair, I can sort of see the critics' point of view, because the film does have some issues. Like casting Johnny Depp as Tonto, a Native American known for his racial stereotypes. And yes, it's a bit weird, but I really didn't have a problem with it. It's a case of ability over authenticity. There's a lot of Jack Sparrow in his role performance here, but it works within the confines of the film. He's very entertaining, very energetic and he actually manages to bring a lot of good drama into the role. Some of that is writing, but most is Depp being a good actor. So yeah, I guess that the American critics just felt that their feathers had been needlessly ruffled by a subject they didn't want to look at too closely, but as a European I have no such problems.Give The Lone Ranger a chance. It's essentially Pirates of the Caribbean given a western makeover, so if you liked any of those films you're going to love this one. Unless you're an American, in which case you might be insulted.

59,BeneCumb,"Overly long, overly Verbinsky and overly Disney",7,24 October 2013,"In the era of digital effects, the Disney Pictures or Studios have created or produced dozens of large-scale movies with huge budgets and selection of actors ""for certain"". Three Gore Verbinsky's Pirates of the Caribbean have been commercial successes, and he and producers began to guess what the viewers would desire. As for the movie in question, the expectations were much higher, but ""milking the same cow"" has its consequences due to many Pirates-tricks, simplified screenplay with failure to follow rules of physics, black-and-white depiction of good and bad, uneven tandem of protagonists. And all this in a long and see-through garment... Action and chases is not enough - although train-related ones are catchy to follow - if you can easily guess the following scenes or double-crossing, and mandatory funny, but not witty remarks in improper places provide additional ambivalence to the movie.As for the cast, Johnny Depp, Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter are equal to their task, but the rest, including Armie Hammer as John Reid, are nothing special; why was Hammer chosen in a first place, is peculiar to me, perhaps not to outshine Depp?

Later he sought revenge for the massacre and sought Justice on the outlaws' leader. In this film directed by Gore Verbinski we become the unsuspecting audience who've seen this offering in the 'Ranger' saga. Upon reflection, I say, not since the original series of the 'Keystone Cops' have I seen such a jumbled rendition of murderous mayhem brought together to what was suppose to be a serious overture to a fading memory. In the 1960's American audiences anxiously awaited what should have been a Modern version of Bob Kanes' 'Batman.' The majority of television viewers were expecting an Adult, more sophisticated and certainly more mature T.V. series on the Caped Crusader. Instead audiences were treated to a colorful, slap stick version of batman in a visual comic book form. The conclusion and final consensus was, the batman of the 1960s' was a letdown and an object failure. As entertainment, it spiraled, crashed and burned. The actors Adam West and Burt Ward were laughed into obscurity. Not their fault. Fast forward to The Lone Ranger. This newest Movie version was as big a disaster as changing Claton Moore for John Hart. Despite having the star power of Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp, William Fichtner as Butch Cavendish and talented Tom Wilkinson, this film too was a disaster. Was it bad? It was as bad as one could get. Too much of anything is not necessarily a good thing and this movie had too much of everything. Too much good from the Good guy and too much bad from the heavy. Tonto who once earned his side kick role with such lines as 'That right Kemo-sabe' and 'them bad men Kemo-sabe. ' has been reduced to a clownish half wit muttering 'Me trade-em with spirit horse.' As a result, the director took a legendary T.V. series and make a black mockery of the true nature of the story. Despite seeing this entire movie, I sat and watched an icon become as dead as the Rangers' in the movie and that should never happen to a tradition. As such I don't recommend this film. ***",The Lone Ranger

I wish the film could have been a fun action adventure film with some humorous moments mixed in, but it just does not do that.Johnny Depp comes across too cartoonie in the role of Tonto, that may have worked as Jack Sparrow in the pirate films, but it just does not work here. Armie Hammer as the title character, is so annoyingly whiny to the point where he makes it impossible to care about him. Not to mention he does not become the lone ranger until towards the end.Now the good things I can say about the movie is that it's beautifully well shot, the director really took advantage of the western setting.

62,freemantle_uk,Pirates of the Caribbean goes West,5,3 May 2014,"From the director, writers and producer of the Pirates of the Caribbean films they attempt to repeat their success with a reboot of The Lone Ranger. But the film was plagued with production problems, a bloated budget and poor critical response and it ended up being one of the biggest flops of 2013.In 1869 in Texas the idealistic young lawyer John Reid (Arnie Hammer) returns to his home town of Colby to bring in the rule of law. But when a notorious criminal, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) escapes whilst journeying to Colby John has to team up with his Texas Ranger brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and seek to find Butch and his gang. The rangers are betrayed and John has to team up with a strange, unhinged Native American, Tonto (Johnny Depp) who also wants revenge. Soon the pair discover a bigger conspiracy that could lead to war between the United States and the Comanche tribe.The final 30 minutes was real fun romp, offering an excellent action sequence that was light-hearted and adventurous whilst the William Tell Overture was playing in the background. It was a romp and this was what the whole of the film should have been. But The Lone Ranger suffers from a number of problems: these range from the strange decision to frame the story as an elderly Tonto narrators it to a young boy in 1933, when the telling the story would have been stronger if it was told straight and the tonal shift being very comic with John and Tonto arguing and falling into slapstick whilst Fichtner is coming from another film where he is dark, menacing and literally a cannibal.There was potential for a good romp but director Gore Verbinski does fall into the same traps of the Pirates films, as Tonto and John Reid are basically Jack Sparrow and Will Turner with their buddy routine, the long running time and the shifting tone. The idea of John Reid being a idealistic, intelligential man who wants to bring law and order and only uses a gun as a last resort, but Hammer plays the character too nerdy, suffering both from the slapstick comedy and he is stronger when the character was played more straight. Whilst there has been a lot of criticism of Depp playing a Native America, but the big issues are Depp is really playing another Jack Sparrow type character that has been his career lately, being comically wacky. It would have served the film better if Tonto was played more straight-laced and he definitely should have been played by a younger actor, someone in their early thirties. The shtick between John and Tonto just reminded me how much better it was done in the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes films, not helped with Hans Zimmer providing a similar score for both franchises.The Lone Ranger does have a excellent supporting cast, Fichtner, Tom Wilkinson, Ruth Wilson, Helena Bonham Carter and Barry Pepper. They are all at least solid and Fichtner does make an excellent villain but his gruesome actions should have been cut from the script: he still could have been interesting, cold-blooded villain who killed on a whim without needing to be made into the complete psychopath. Wilson is a good actress but she was given the thankless damsel in distress role and Bonham Carter was underused in her role as a brothel owner.The screenplay itself is a mishmash of ideas, having surreal supernatural ideas whilst also wanting to be a more grounded swashbucking affair with political and business conspiracies. It should have gone one way or the other but the film tries to play it both ways and it ends up leading to some big plot holes/questions. Questions that they properly wanted to answer in the sequel that is not going to happen. As you would expect from a Gore Verbinski/Jerry Brockheimer production the action and special effects is of a high standard and the third act is what you would want from a Lone Ranger film. But this film should have been a light-hearted swashbucking film and not this product that wanted to be a comedy and a dark grim film.",The Lone Ranger
63,PWNYCNY,Outstanding reinterpretation of a classic story.,10,4 July 2013,"This movie is great. It has it all - a great story, strong acting, lots of actions, impressive cinematography and does homage to its cinematic roots. The movie is about personal transformation and reveals why the Lone Ranger and Tonto do what they do. To rehash the story format from the 1950s would have been hokey and pretentious. Instead, the director humanizes the two principal characters, adding humorous touches while maintaining their dignity. The movie develops the relationship between The Lone Ranger and Tonto; to have presented them from the start as a team and as fully developed characters would have been presumptuous and a rip-off of the television series. Instead the movie shows how their relationship evolves so that by the end of the movie the audience knows these characters and understands that these two men, so different from each other, are now a team. Johnny Depp's rendition of Tonto is outstanding in the way he is able to mix humor and the dramatic and Armie Hammer is the epitome of The Lone Ranger. But the strongest performance is given by William Fichtner whose rendition of an outlaw and the Ranger's nemesis is worthy of award consideration. Far from being a mere retelling of an old story, this movie is a carefully well-crafted reinterpretation of a classic story that is immensely entertaining.",The Lone Ranger
64,stevendbeard,Quirky But Interesting,7,3 July 2013,"I saw ""The Lone Ranger"" , starring Johnny Depp-The Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Donnie Brasco; Armie Hammer-Mirror Mirror, The Social Network and he has also signed up to be in the upcoming 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' movie as Illya Kuryakin; William Fichtner-Entourage-t.v., Prison Break-t.v.; Helena Bonham Carter-Dark Shadows-2012, the Harry Potter movies and Tom Wilkinson-Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol, The Green Hornet-2011. This is a retelling of the classic Lone Ranger story by director Gore Verbinski-Rango & The Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The last Lone Ranger movie-The Legend of the Lone Ranger-was in 1981 and also starred a relatively unknown actor in the lead role-Klinton Spilsbury. This is also the first time that the actor playing Tonto-Johnny- has gotten top billing over the Lone Ranger-Armie-but let's face it, Johnny Depp's name will draw more ticket buyers than Armie Hammer's will. The movie starts in 1933, where a little boy meets Johnny in a side show carnival. Johnny tells the boy-in flashback-about how Armie became the masked man. William plays Butch Cavendish, the infamous outlaw that massacred the Rangers that were in hot pursuit, leaving only one survivor, Armie. Johnny finds and nurses Armie back to health and they proceed to right justice by bringing in William, for trial. Helena-and wait until you see what her leg can do-plays a lady that runs a house of ill repute and Tom is in charge of building a railroad through Indian territories. There is a lot of humor in the movie, which can be expected with Johnny and of course, some pretty good action scenes-near the end, is a good one involving 2 trains. There are times in the flashbacks that things are a little exaggerated in Johnny's retelling-which is probably a little confusing to some people- but the more you understand Johnny's character, then you realize what is going on. Johnny wears a dead crow on his head-even other Indians think he is a little eccentric-but it is explained why he does it. Armie plays a little too much like an idiot at times but this is an origin story and it can be expected. Even though this is a Disney movie-like the Pirates movies-there are a few scenes that might be a little too violent for small children; The Rangers being massacred, the Indians being massacred and Oh yeah, one scene where a man cuts another man's heart out and then eats it. As far as the iconic symbols of The Lone Ranger myth; They do use the Lone Ranger theme, he does use silver bullets, Johnny calls Armie 'Kemosabe'-although he has a different meaning for it than the original 'Friend', which is hilarious- and Armie does utter the phrase 'Hi Yo Silver!' FYI: In the original radio shows and books, The Lone Ranger is the great, great uncle of The Green Hornet. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and action sequences and has a running time of 2 hours & 29 minutes. Some people may not like this new version but I really enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray-One thing that doesn't make much sense to me is that people will say that they want something different but then they end up wanting the same thing, over & over, again.",The Lone Ranger
65,estebangonzalez10,A Disaster in the making,4,12 July 2013,"""There come a time, when good man must wear mask.""Teaming up Gore Verbinski with Johnny Depp and several others from the crew that brought us The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise seemed like a great idea for The Lone Ranger, but unfortunately the magic was gone here in what is in my opinion the biggest disappointment in the Summer box office this year. The film was a huge failure for the following reasons: I don't tend to complain about long movies, but this film felt to drag forever with so many unnecessary elements and so many senseless action scenes. The lead roles were disappointing despite how much I love Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, but I think the main issue had to do with the screenplay. They made the Lone Ranger look like such a weak and silly character that it was really hard to sympathize with him. Johnny Depp plays his silly self once again and I think he goes a little to overboard with the wackiness of his character. It works sometimes (like it did with John Sparrow), but here it fails. The comedy in this film didn't really work either, I found most of the jokes a bit recycled. As much as I wanted to enjoy this movie, I couldn't manage to get hooked with the story or its characters. The only moments were I felt moved was during the climatic action scene at the end where they used the familiar soundtrack of the TV series. The nostalgic factor appealed to me there, but it wasn't enough. At the end my favorite character ended up being the horse, Silver. That sort of sums it all.As for the plot, fans of the series will be familiar with the story. Johnny Depp is Tonto, a Comanche during the late 1800's, who is narrating the story of his encounter with the Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) to a little boy (Mason Elston Cook) who finds him at a museum. Tonto explains how he ran into this man through a series of flashbacks. He basically finds John Reid (the Lone Ranger) dead after he and seven other Texas Rangers were ambushed by the fugitive, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and his gang. Tonto believes that John is a Spirit Walker and that he's been chosen by the white spirit horse to bring justice back to the land. That explains why John is alive and Tonto convinces him to wear the mask and become the Lone Ranger. Together they decide to bring Cavendish to justice and restore order to the west. Tom WIlkinson, Ruth Wilson, Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale, and Barry Pepper all play supporting roles. I'm a fan of westerns and enjoy the cinematography these films usually have. Many people have said that the genre is dying, but there have been some exceptional westerns lately. I hope The Lone Ranger isn't the film that ends up definitely burying the genre, because it does everything wrong here. First of all the macho hero is missing; with all the action this film desperately needed one! Despite the great cinematography the film felt as dry as the desert scenes. There were so many unnecessary subplots going on that the film seemed to diverge and go into all directions. It just felt really chaotic and it is a pity because I really wanted to like The Lone Ranger for what the character has meant to past generations. Unfortunately this was an unnecessarily long pointless film. You might be better off if you just wait and watch the final 15 minutes of the film that actually feel more like the TV series.",The Lone Ranger
66,Fluke_Skywalker,Who *was* that masked man?,5,22 January 2014,"Disney's ill-fated attempt to re-invent The Lone Ranger for 21st century audiences is a prime example of Hollywood excess. Under no circumstances should it cost $200+ million dollars to make a Western; Even one meant to be a Summer tent pole flick. The result is an over the top, tonally bi-polar mess that neither entertains or moves the viewer.Absolutely no one associated with this project seemed to understand (or worse, care) about the mythology of this character. It merely felt like an attempt to recapture the lightening in a bottle of the first (and only good) 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film.The increasingly annoying Johnny Depp once again mistakes quirky for character, and co-star Armie Hammer does his best impression of a department store mannequin as the two chemistry-deficient actors run from one meaningless scene to the next for two-and-a-half bloated, joyless hours.""Who was that masked man?""

68,arthur_tafero,The Lone Ranger: From Tonto's Perspective,8,11 December 2018,"I saw the original Clayton Moore Lone Ranger in both the theater and on TV. It was one of my favorite shows. Tonto, in these venues, was pretty quiet, and almost never made a wise crack. It was clear that The Lone Ranger was the main attraction. In the 21st century version of the Lone Ranger, Tonto is the main attraction. Not that there is anything wrong with that, as Seinfeld used to say. We get the Lone Ranger from the perspective of Tonto; Tonto is the main character in the feature (and Depp, of course, is the better actor. and gets the meatier role. If an actor read this script and had a choice of roles, they would jump on Tonto in a second. The production values are outstanding, and even excessive, at times. The supporting cast, the heavies and the heroes, are all top-notch. And the film is not Pirates of the Panhandle, as some may be calling it, or as my Italian friend, Giuseppe calls it ""The Loan Arranger"" . He thought it was a story about a banker. The cinematography is first-rate, and I would almost bet money that this canyon where the massacre took place was the same one in The Big Country, but I could be wrong. It was a pleasure to watch the film from start to finish, though it may not be suitable for younger children (unlike the squeaky clean Moore episodes and movie). And somehow, I still prefer the black and white one.",The Lone Ranger
69,sauravjoshi85,Doesn't deserve so much criticism. An entertaining movie.,8,8 August 2020,"The Lone Ranger is western action movie directed by Gore Verbinski and stars Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer, William Fichtner, Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter.The movie best will be remembered for the strong acting of Johnny Depp and it's comic timing. The movie is certainly an underrated and in my opinion doesn't deserve as much criticism as it had got.Acting is decent but mainly on the shoulders of Depp. Hammer was good and rest of the cast were average but satisfying. Direction of the movie is also average and screenplay is good and funny. The climax is predictable and little longer then expected but still doesn't disappoints.The only disappointment which I felt was the length of the movie as it's gets boring in between due to it's painful length.Overall an entertaining movie and doesn't deserves so much criticism.

70,r96sk,A very good film in my books; despite having issues,8,12 November 2020,"It loses its way a bit at around the midway point, but all in all 'The Lone Ranger' is a film I found entertainment in.No doubt helped by much of the people behind 2003's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' - my favourite film - reuniting for this. From Johnny Depp to Gore Verbinski to Jerry Bruckheimer to Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio. Therefore, I was bound to like it.Depp is enjoyable, as is usually the case. There are, of course, question marks as to whether he's 'right' for the role. He claims he has Native American heritage, though you enter a real grey area with all that stuff. Anyway, judging by his acting, he's fun. Armie Hammer is much better than I thought he'd be, while William Fichtner makes for a good villain. Nice to see Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter involved, also.I like the way the story is told, involving Depp and Mason Cook. It certainly adds a sense of intrigue to events. The end scenes are also enjoyable, at least visually - I don't love the score all that much, to be honest. However, as noted at the top, the middle part of the film is less entertaining - though the finale helps pick things back up.I've, evidently, seen better from these lot. Still, it's a very good film in my books; despite having issues.",The Lone Ranger
71,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"a tad overstuffed, but still a treat",7,4 December 2016,"There's always those films that get buried under a landslide of terrible reviews upon release, prompting me to avoid seeing them, and to wait a while down the line, sometimes years, to take a peek. I was so excited for Disney's The Lone Ranger, being a die hard fan of both Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp's monolithic work on Pirates Of The Caribbean, and just a lover of all this western, as well as the old television serial. The film came out, was met with an uproar of negative buzz, I went ""well, damn"", and swiftly forgot it even existed. The other day I give it a watch, and would now like to pull a Jay and Silent Bob, save up cash for flights and tour the continent beating up every critic I can find in the phone book. I was whisked away like it was the first Pirates film all over again, the swash, buckle and spectacle needed for a rousing adventure picture all firmly present and hurtling along like the numerous speeding locomotives populating the action set pieces. Obviously the material has been vividly revamped from the fairly benign black and white stories of the TV show, especially when you have a circus ringmaster like Verbinski at the reigns, the guy just loves to throw everything he has into the action, packed with dense choreography and fluid camera-work that never ceases to amaze. Johnny Depp loves to steal the show with theatrical prancing and garish, peacock like costumes, and he kind of takes center stage as Tonto, the loyal sidekick to the Lone Ranger, who is given a decidedly roguish, unstable and altogether eccentric edge that the series never had, but I consider it a welcome addition to a character who always seemed one note in the past. Armie Hammer has a rock solid visage with two electric blue eyes peeking out of that iconic leather strap mask. It's an origin story of sorts, chronicling Reid's journey to visit his legendary lawman brother (James Badge Dale) and family in the small town West. Also arriving, however, is ruthless butcher and psychopathic outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) at the behest of opportunistic railroad tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson). Tempers flare and violence erupts, and before you know it Reid is without a family, left for dead in the desert and befriended by Tonto, who himself is a tragic loner in a way. Revenge is on the minds of both, as they venture on a journey to find Cavendish and his men, discover what slimy Cole is up to and bring order to the west, one silver bullet at a time (actually there's only one silver bullet used in the entire film, but let's not get technical). Now, I'll admit that the middle of the film meanders and drags quite a bit, half losing my interest until the intrigue steps up a notch. A sequence where the pair visit a circus brothel run by a take no nonsense Helena Bonham Carter seems like unnecessary dead weight and could have been heavily trimmed, as could other scenes in that area that just aren't needed and might have been excised to make the film more streamlined. It's no matter though, because soon we are back in the saddle for a jaw dropping third act full of gunfights, train destruction and unreal stunts that seem like the sister story to Pirates, some of the action often directly mimicing parts from those films. Depp is like fifty, and still scampers around like a squirrel, it's a sight to see. Fichtner is a world class act, his mouth permanently gashed into a gruesome snarl, the threat of violence oozing from his pores and following him like a cloud. Wilkinson can take on any role, period, and he's in full on asshole mode, Cole is a solid gold prick and a villain of the highest order. Barry Pepper has a nice bit as a cavalry honcho who never seems to quite know what's going on (it's perpetual chaos), watch for Stephen Root and Ruth Wilson as Reid's sister in law who ends up well you'll see. It's fairly dark and bloody for a Disney film as well, there's a grisly Temple Of Doom style moment and attention is paid towards America's very dark past with the indigenous people, which is strong stuff indeed for a kid orientated film. Nothing compares to the flat out blissful adrenaline during the final action sequence though. That classic William Tell overture thunders up alongside two careening trains and your TV will struggle to keep up with such spectacle, it's really the most fun the film has and a dizzyingly crowd pleasing sequence. All of this is told by an elderly Tonto in a museum exhibit, to a young boy who dreams of the west. A ghost from the past, part comic relief and part noble warrior, Tonto is a strange character indeed, and the old version of him has a glassy eyed reverence for his adventures before, the last one alive to remember. Many a review will tell you how bad this film is, but not mine. I found myself in pure enjoyment for the better part of it, and would gladly watch again",The Lone Ranger
72,3xHCCH,Overlong and Overstuffed,5,14 July 2013,"Watching this movie is a gamble because the critics and US ticket receipts have already condemned this to be a bad movie as well as a box- office flop. The trailer was not really too convincing for me as well. But there are very big names behind this movie -- Gore Verbisnki and Johnny Depp, Hans Zimmer, among others -- all of whom have a Hollywood pedigree you cannot just deny. ""The Lone Ranger"" was the story of how idealistic young lawyer John Reid got exposed to the ""real"" wild wild west, and how he was influenced by a quirky renegade Comanche named Tonto to become the titular masked vigilante. The story was actually good and even substantive, dealing with important issues like white man's greed leading to genocide of the Native American tribes. It had neat little twists and turns in the plot that were not predictable.However for me, the way it was told by Director Gore Verbinski was too long-winded and snail-paced. OK, there were some very exciting moments here and there (namely at the beginning and towards the end), and those were the best parts of the film. But it cannot be denied that there were times when the momentum would slow down so much and dip to boring levels. There were supposedly funny gimmicks that simply fall flat, like those inexplicable vicious rabbits.From the very start, the carnival museum scene employed as the framing device, was already dragging and too weird. That is not good when your film has a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes.Johnny Depp's Oscar-nominated antics as Captain John Sparrow did not translate well in the character of Tonto. Many of his deadpan one- liners were only mild funny at best, since Tonto was not exactly visually flamboyant. However, seeing him feed a stuffed crow with peanuts, or put his head in a birdcage, or carry a parasol in the desert was downright UN-funny for me. It even felt demeaning to the character. It was also strange how poor Armie Hammer, who gets to play the title role as the Lone Ranger, actually felt more like the side kick here. Of course, Depp was the star and you feel it! This story revolved around Tonto, going all the way back from his childhood to his old age. The way the character of John Reid was written, he was never truly fully in control of his own actions throughout the film. Hammer was a striking ""Lone Ranger"", looking good in his ranger hat, mask, and riding on Silver, but even his iconic pose and line will get a solid knock from Tonto.Overall, watching ""The Lone Ranger"" is not a total loss. Those extravagant train stunts were very exciting to watch. Although you would wonder if those were physically possible in the real world, you will enjoy the way these elaborately choreographed stunts were executed and edited. Hearing the familiar ""Lone Ranger Theme"" (actually the ""William Tell Overture"") still makes the scenes it accompanies more exciting. But the over-indulgent style of story-telling resulted in an over-long and over-stuffed pie that was not too easy to eat and digest.",The Lone Ranger
73,drystyx,"Not only the Magic, but explains the Magic",9,4 July 2013,"It wasn't hard to outdo the preachy contrived plot of the 2003 Ranger movie, but this one took a step beyond to become a mainstay.First, it is an adventure film, a Western adventure. The Lone Ranger is a mystique character, and part of the challenge is that he tries to bring men to justice alive. Same for Superman. If they didn't have this challenge, they would have no conflict whatsoever. It makes for a puzzle.Tonto takes center stage here, but unlike the 2003 disaster, he is a character instead of a symbol of a godlike race. Here, no favorites are played. The most evil ones in this story are a pair of white men, and other white men they enlist, but we aren't given sermons about this.Depp is great as Tonto. The museum scenes are a bit too much for me, but it is good for the kids. The out of sequence bits work, partly because they aren't emphasized too much. Depp, as Tonto, craftily plays this with a subtle humor, and that is just what is needed for this.There is the magic and mystique of the Ranger, but also an explanation given for it, as ""Nature out of balance"". We are dealing with a supernatural chain of events which do allow the Lone Ranger to ride a horse through and on top of railroad cars.Great blend of humor and adventure, and at the same time a crafty blend of Shakespeare and Indiana Jones. This is better than what meets the eye, and what meets the eye is extra special in itself, with plenty of eye candy for men and women.",The Lone Ranger
74,pensman,the director got it wrong,4,29 July 2015,"Gore Verbinski just couldn't figure it out. Basically the movie is too dark for a Disney movies and not dark enough to be an Eastwood Western. The confusing tone is set during the first twenty or so minutes. The is a mix of slapstick comedy, serious violence, and decent high end special effects. But it is the movement back and forth between comedy and violence that dooms the movie. Perhaps Verbinski was thinking of the next installment of The Pirates of the Caribbean and forgot he was on the set of a completely different film. One of the better sequences in this film takes place after Armie Hammer's ranger is captured by the Comanche and learns Tonto's backstory; unfortunately the mood set by that telling is ruined by the silliness that follows it. So you have such an uneven mix of film(s) here you wonder who the intended audience was. I liked the darker vision and wish that had been the vision Verbinski stayed with. The best I can say is some of the scenery was spectacular but the mixed plot kept doing it a disservice.",The Lone Ranger
75,aharmas,It's a Mystery to Me,9,7 July 2013,"With all the bad publicity this film was getting, I was ready to give up on it, but I was also extremely curious to see the wreck that people were so ready to attack. If it was a disaster, I wanted to check it by myself.Well, what a surprise!! The movie is actually one of the best of the year. I can't seem to understand where all the hatred is coming from, why people are staying away from it, and what are those faults people keep finding. First of all, it's exquisitely photographed, the acting is actually really good, with Hammer channeling the spirit of the hero, and Depp pulling off another entry in his gallery of odd characters. Yes, the face paint is disturbing sometimes, but he certainly knows how to create a different personality and entertain you with it. I liked his interaction with various supporting characters and his comments, which were insightful and support the flow of the narrative. He can do much more than other famous personalities who depend on one-note performances, good looks, or those omnipresent special effects.I liked the story. It has to be long because it covers the various time periods that set up the creation of the ranger, and why Tonto is important to the couple. There is enough attention paid to the villains (get ready for another surprise), and it's certainly fun to see the talented Tom Wilkinson playing a bad guy.There has been talk about how expensive the film is, and people where questioning where the money ended up. Well, it's all there. The sets are fantastic, and it looks like a lot of action was more dependent on actual physical special effects rather than CGI. I loved the way the Old West was brought back, and an important and rather period of American History is relieved. There is a scene involving the massacre of Comanches that is absolutely devastating. I loved the salon, the outdoor scenes where the railroad is being constructed and blown up eventually, and the costumes, paying more attention to detail than the classic Old Westerns.Finally, much credit for the fun goes to the fantastic job done by that marvelous horse that manages to steal a few scenes. Seeing him appear in the most unexpected parts of buildings and save our heroes a few times was classic entertainment. I liked him so much that I was hoping he had a stunt double for the dangerous scenes so that he wouldn't get hurt. If he did the actual work, he should get an honorary Oscar because part of the excitement is due to way he shined in the film.Overall, I have to say that the film is getting a bad rap. I was disturbed by the preview, which highlighted not the worst of the film but gave a very limited and not appealing picture of what the whole product is. In fact, I was more turned off by the gimmick of the film that has defeated this film in the box office because I just can't understand why people sometimes flock to unimaginative offerings. Give this one a chance. It might not be ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", but I certainly wouldn't mind a sequel or seeing it again. **** (out of five).",The Lone Ranger
76,peterp-450-298716,Disney action with Depp walking around feeding a dead bird on his head ... Should be fun,6,11 March 2014,"""Never take off the mask"" It seems like ages since I've seen a western. I'm immediately teleported back in time when I was still a little kid. There was almost on a weekly base somewhere an old western on the TV. Usually on Friday afternoons you could see one on a German channel with Roy Rogers, after a cartoon of ""Schweinchen Dick"" or some slapstick movie starring Buster Keaton. And in the weekends it was always somewhere late at night on ARD, ZDF or WDR. My dad thought there was only one kind of genre movie worth to watch ... indeed Westerns. Everybody was stubbornly silent about the fact that those guys walked around in that time with real crappy guns and probably couldn't hit an elephant at 2 meters. I promised myself that I'd never see a western again... or someone should force me into doing that. I'm filing this immediately under the term ""traumatic experience"".And yet, I watched ""The Lone Ranger"". Also a bit out of nostalgia. My mother sometimes bought me a comic of ""The Lone Ranger"". And of course the portrayal of Tonto by Johnny Depp was also a reason to give this movie a chance.It was clear from the beginning that this was a Disney Movie. Improbable situations, surviving a crashing speedy train and reappear unscratched, and Silver performing feats as if it was Rintintin. It's known that Depp always chooses eccentric characters. And ultimately he always plays them all in the same manner. He always seems to be under influence of some drug. Probably it'll be ""fire-water"" in this movie. He really resembled an Indian Jack Sparrow sometimes. That's a guarantee for some dry humorous one-liners, as expected. And there will be quite a few that will surely make you chuckle.Biggest downside for me was that it's a long movie although there's very little to say. Some actions were also exaggerated and over-the-top. But I must admit, I wasn't bored. Some action scenes were very well made up and meticulously put together. Ultimately, it's not just a straight-on harmless Disney movie, given the numerous cases of victims and some imaginative explicit scenes such as the supposedly eating of Dan's heart by the really scary and evil looking Butch Cavendish. The slaughter of Comanches by means of Gatling Guns wasn't exactly suitable for young viewers.Conclusion: a relaxing action/adventure comic hero-story with lots of action, but little substance. And I still don't understand what was going on with those rabbits ... serious form of myxomatosis, I suppose.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The Lone Ranger
77,davidmvining,"Overlong, confused, overstuffed, and overambitious. But that last action scene is amazing.",5,14 April 2020,"The final action scene is almost worth the price of admission alone. If the movie were about 45 minutes shorter, I'd say that it was definitely worth the price of admission alone. Instead, it's the tail end of a rather bloated and unfocused origin story of a piece of intellectual property no one had thought about in decades. I don't actively dislike much of the film, but there's just simply too much going off in too many different directions, robbing the movie of narrative focus it sorely needed.I remember news reports of The Lone Ranger's pre-production and Disney's reticence to greenlight it. The problem was the budget. The original estimate was $250 million, which they downgraded to $215 million and then ballooned back up to $250 million. That's a lot of money to put into something like this, but Gore Verbinski had proven himself profitable with huge budgets through the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, so it sort of makes sense. It's still weird to see so much money on this.Anyway, the movie itself is as big as its runtime and budget would imply, but big in a Pirates sequel sort of way not a Biblical epic sort of way. Now, as much as I do enjoy the original Pirates trilogy, The Lone Ranger takes it to another level. There are three main antagonists (one of whom is introduced more than halfway through the film), a bevy of supporting characters of limited use, and a weird framing device of Tanto as a museum piece in a fair. It feels like the result of a writers' room where everyone had different ideas about how the story should go and no one got overruled. Everything got included.The messiness becomes clear very early when the movie essentially begins with its second largest action sequence. The film certainly tops it eventually, but our introductions to most of our main characters is a big action sequence that leads to William Fitchner's Butch Cavendish escaping from custody, Johnny Depp's Tonto establishes that he wants to kill Cavendish, Armie Hammer's John Reed shows up in town as a bit of a well-dressed dandy, Tom Wilkinson's Latham Cole feels vaguely villainous in particular to Reed's sister-in-law Rebecca, and John's brother, Dan played by James Badge Dale, shows himself to be the polar opposite of his brother. That's a lot, and very little of it requires a chase scene through, on top of, and alongside a speeding train that goes off the rails in special effects spectacular fashion. On its own, it's a perfectly fine action sequence, but when it's followed up by the ambush of Dan and John's posse to chase after Cavendish and that ambush is a rather small scale shootout, it feels out of balance. Shouldn't the bigger sequence have come after the smaller one? In an effort to build tension and excitement? It's an odd choice.As you can see, there's a lot to go through in the first twenty minutes of the film, and the film isn't nearly done introducing things. There's Tonto's backstory involving showing two white men to a river source and a large silver deposit, his tribe's expelling of him because of his weirdness, the supernatural elements that lead to John's resurrection and supposed super powers, the brothel and the madame who runs it who happens to have a double barrel shotgun hidden in her scrimshawed ivory leg, and the United States cavalry, represented by Barry Pepper's Captain Fuller.There is a lot going on in this movie, and it gets weirdly confusing as hidden relationships come out, long masked motives materialize, and Johnny Depp keeps trying to steal the screen by being the weirdest Indian in film history. It's overwhelming, and the movie really suffers for it.There is some thought going on in there, though, which is why I can't completely discard the film. Our introduction to John Reed has him holding a copy of John Locke's Treatises on Government and he and Cole end up quoting it back to each other slightly. Locke is never mentioned again past the twenty minute mark, so I can't be sure if the evolution of John's character from being the Lockean ideal of a civilized man to a man who embraces the state of nature of his situation and takes justice into his own hands is as intentional as it could be. I want to give the movie credit for it and say that it was actually being rather subtle about it, but considering the markedly unsubtle way that the Lockean ideals were introduced early, I'm probably wrong about that.And, of course, there's the final action sequence. It's everything the movie should have been in microcosm. It's clear with an understandable set of goals but complex enough (involving two trains in chase, a handful of switches, and the decoupling and recoupling of some cars) to remain interesting. It's fun and exciting and has the best use of music in the film. The music is credited to Hans Zimmer, but it feels like he phoned it in for most of the film. In the final sequence, though, we finally get the franchise's telltale use of the William Tell Overture, and it's expanded wonderfully while given a great orchestral arrangement. The special effects are great and less cartoonish in terms of physics as some of the earlier sequences were (especially the opening train crash), and it's just an overall good time at the movies. It's one of my favorite single action sequences of the last couple of decades.The problem is that it's at the tail end of an overlong, confused, overstuffed, and overambitious adventure that needed a lot more focus and clarity around its basic storytelling.",The Lone Ranger
78,jadepietro,The Lone Ranger: Overblown and Underdeveloped,4,8 July 2013,"This film is not recommended.Wearing his iconic white cowboy hat and black mask and having his faithful Indian companion at his side, The Lone Ranger rides again and again and again. From his original inception as fictional radio hero and his novelization in the thirties to his equally popular television show in the fifties, this ex-Texas ranger continues to fight for justice in the wild wild West. Now making his leap to the big screen on his white stallion, Silver, he arrives to a theater near you with a modern revisionist view to capture today's movie audiences' attention. The same catchphrases are there: ""Hi-Yo Silver! Away!"" and ""Ke-mo-sah-bee"". So are the silver bullets and the famous William Tell Overture theme. What's missing is the fun and spirit of the myth in this overblown and noisy dud.Johnny Depp plays Tonto (the ironic Spanish word for foolish). Depp truly lives for his namesake in his awful interpretation of the Lone Ranger's trusty sidekick, although in this film, he does seem to play a more pivotal role. (Surprisingly, there is no public outcry of political correctness by having this Caucasian actor playing what is essentially a Native American's role. Paging Sacheen Littlefeather! This is, at least, one time in which the Indians can honestly say that they triumphed by omission over the White Man.) Depp can add this role to his sad list of eccentric characters that he has been playing of late. In The Lone Ranger, his acting ranks somewhere between silly (as in his Dark Shadow's Barnaby Collins' character) and wretched (as in Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Someone needs to rein in this talented actor. He delivers one of his worst performances in his varied career.Playing our cowboy hero is Armie Hammer. He has the rugged looks and charisma for the title role, but his part is so underwritten that he become totally uninteresting. This Lone Ranger has no anti-hero pangs or moral dilemma. He plays his character so one- dimensionally. He comes off as such a milquetoast, a plain vanilla imitation. Their comic bits and non-chemistry flat-lines. Also teamed with Depp again is Helen Bonham Carter playing Red Harrington, a madam whose got one leg up on her competition (a not-so-subtle rip-off of Tarantino's Grindhouse character, so out-of-place for this era that it becomes unintentionally laughable). Ms. Carter needs some advice with her recent acting choices too. Other fine character actors shamefully involved in this disaster are Tom Wilkinson, James Badge Dale, Barry Pepper and William Fichtner as a Hannibal Lecter inspired villain complete with gold tooth.The Lone Ranger relies too much on anachronistic gadgets and silly death-defying antics to the point that there is no reality to ground this absurd film. At the helm of this joyless ride is director Gore Verbinski. The director knows how to skillfully stage and film the intricately choreographed stunt work to the maximum effect although it's much ado about nothing. The film is literally a circus with one action set piece to the next and no plot structure in between. These sequences do hold your attention but immediately fade from memory.However, the major problem is a bi-polar script with serious mood swings. The real villains of the film are its screenwriters, Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott, and Terry Rossio, who seem more concerned with set-ups for the action sequences rather than developing any characters of worth. One moment the movie is an action flick, then it swings into slapstick comedy, no, now it's a traditional Western shoot-em-up. The film, like the action, is all over the place. Rather than exhilarate, the film just exasperates in its desperation to please. On the plus side, Verbinski assembled a first class production team that make the film visually exciting on a technical level, with special mention going out to the artisans who contributed the strong art direction, impressive photography and detailed costume design. One can readily see the money spent on this big budget venture, or more aptly put, misadventure.I can honestly say that The Lone Ranger will not be riding again anytime soon. To say that the film is mindless fun overstates its true purpose. It just mindlessness in search of fun. From the weak audience reaction and possible word-of-mouth that is certain to follow this movie, this Lone Ranger may be very alone, with moviegoers asking themselves, ""Who was that masked man anyway? And why did I waste my time and money on this mess?"" GRADE: CANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com to add any comments.",The Lone Ranger
79,Sherazade,Not the worst thing I've seen...,7,2 June 2014,"People and critics alike made it seem like this was the Disney version of 'The Tourist' or 'The Rum Diary' or something but it was nothing of that sort at all. I guess there is just a vendetta out against Johnny Depp and his films these last few years or people were just uncomfortable with the subject matter of this film which deals with the painful stories of the ""White Man"" pretty much took over America from ""Native Americans"" while briefly touching on slavery and oppression.The film was almost perfect, there were a few scenes that seemed either forced or out of place but the chemistry between the two leads Tonto (Johnny Depp) and John, the lone ranger (Armie Hammer) was commendably good. Helena Bonham Carter is amazing is everything she essays and she was nothing short of that here, Ruth Wilson was also effective and mastered that American southern accent well. I know it was a Disney production and all but they could have done away with the folklore-oral- history-class format between Tonto and the little boy in the beginning.B+",The Lone Ranger
80,rgkarim,The Lone Tonto?,6,3 July 2013,"Hey all, we're back with another movie review as we approach the holiday weekend. In honor of the patriotic holiday 4th of July, Hollywood decided to revive the classic Western heroes of The Lone Ranger and Tonto, in Jerry Bruckheimer's latest production entitled well ""The Lone Ranger."" While many of the younger generation have had little, if any, experience with the desperado of yore, Disney has once again attempted to bring a series back into the milieu of movies. How do you do that? Put popular actor Johnny Depp into the movie, make him the iconic character, and then advertise as an action flick for the whole family. What was my verdict on the movie? Read on to find out.Let's face it we all thought that this movie was going to be a Western knockoff of Pirates of the Caribbean and in many ways it is. Unfortunately for this reviewer those similarities mirrored the latter films, whose qualities were a bit lowered than the epic first film. The biggest similarity is of course Tonto, the Indian version of Captain Jack Sparrow, just with some broken speech patterns and a little less rum. Depp has dived into the character pool once more, and has adapted well into the awkward tracker/shaman. Using his unique personality, Depp places a spin on a character that is very entertaining to watch. Tonto was the highlight of the movie for me, primarily in his ability to somehow take any situation and make me laugh with just a few words. Like the infamous captain, Tonto also has the ridiculous movement patterns that get stranger as the movie continues on. Unfortunately this film skimped on a few things that made Tonto less of a memorable character. Sparrow had a story, a goal, and a history that bled into the swashbuckling tales and kept us on our toes trying to guess what his next move was. Tonto does not, as his story is very simple, his relationships not well developed, and surprisingly his moves are a bit lacking when compared to his other roles. My guess is they chose to focus on Armie Hammer's story and tried to give Depp the main character role without the main story. Regardless Depp fans will love the man once more, as his dedication and entertaining styles continue to survive the tests of time. Putting Tonto aside, The Lone Ranger lacks a lot of things that I look for in a movie. It's almost as if the directors of this movie couldn't decide what type of a film they wanted to make and instead mashed a few genres together, skimped on the story, and then paid Depp to make the film great. For instance, at the beginning it seemed like this was going to be an adventure that was light hearted, good Western fun that all audiences could enjoy. Then somewhere along the line director Gore Verbinski decided to flip on the dark switch and turn one of the villains into a savage that had a taste for various organs, hello The Last of the Mohicans. These dark moments were surprisingly frequent and often graphic enough, to issue the warning that this is not as much a kid's movie as you might think. When people weren't being massacred though, the action is alright, often more chasing and haphazard shooting than anything really exciting. I felt that the actions scenes were all about Depp making us laugh and less on the outcomes of the battle. Had it not been for the amazing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, I don't think I would have had any interest in the music, yeah it was that lacking. Needless to say, the story itself mirrored the action, where there really wasn't much to grab your attention. A simple linear story, that kind of had a Western feeling to it, but lacked the heart of the wild west that was made famous long ago. Any attempt to develop the characters, was dropped for a hearty laugh and slightly touched upon later on in the film. Speaking of the characters, most of the cast really didn't impress me in both character and acting. Despite the movie being about the Lone Ranger, his story was simple, not that entertaining, and rather bland for the most part. Hammer looks pretty for the girls, but honestly there isn't much to him other than a prop for Tonto. The main villain Butch Cavendish, looked the nasty part, but they didn't really pursue much with him or his party. The damsel in distress Rebecca Reid (Ruth Wilson) but not much else can be said, because like the other characters, she just didn't get a whole lot of interest from the direction staff. If I really had to pick another character that stood out, it would have to be Ms. Red Harrington (Helena Bonham Carter). Most likely this character got more attention because of the actress, but Red has some sass and attitude that mixed with Carter's talents makes for an entertaining cameo with a little more ""kick."" Perhaps next movie, if there is one, will have some more background, but I wouldn't count on it.The Lone Ranger relies a lot of Depp for its entertainment purposes, but as many of us know one man can't make a movie. Verbinski dropped the ball on this one and I can't really say it's worth a trip to the theater. If you're a die-hard Depp fan you'll probably still go and have fun, but skip this and wait for television or Netflix. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Western: 6.0Movie Overall: 6.0",The Lone Ranger
81,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Entertaining but fails to compel through & through,6,6 June 2014,"There are a number of lenses that are used to looking at the financial failure of this film. Was it that its genre was in based on the old west? Apparently as of late for the past decade or so, most vigilante westerns have suffered; Jonah Hex (2010) being the most recent. Or was it perhaps that the main lead was that of an unknown actor who which most viewers ignored? I don't know, it's a possibility. It certainly was definite that Disney was expecting first, partially its reputation and the other half of Johnny Depp's doing to bring in the profit. Weird as it is, even Depp couldn't help save it from not meeting viewers' expectations. That's hard to believe considering Johnny Depp is like a magnet, but like most respected actors, it wasn't him that made the film almost mediocre. It was other parts – mostly the writing.The entire movie is an origin story to that of how The Lone Ranger AKA John Reid (Armie Hammer) and Native American, Tonto (Johnny Depp) become the west's most well-known vigilantes of the late 1800s. The first mistake that's made is Gore Verbinski's direction of how the story is told. Verbinski is better than this. A boy visits a museum at the local carnival and discovers a grotesquely aged Tonto. It is there that the elderly Tonto tells the origin. Wait though, why is Tonto in a museum? Is that his job? Yeah, it's supposed to be comical in some respects but it leaves other questions open without answers. For example, where is the aged John Reid? What occupation does he do for a living now? Or did he die? Why create a separate time with multiple questions when there's already a time being told, where questions need to be answered first? All it does is distract certain viewers.This is just one problem with the writers work, surprisingly two of which have written for the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Unfortunately, the only writing that seems to work are the lines for Johnny Depp. And this would work IF Depp were the real main character. It's no doubt that Depp plays one of the main leads, but he is not The Lone Ranger, which leads to another issue; character interactions. Armie Hammer as John Reid is cast well for the part, but it's the way his character is written that feels out of place. Like most duo lead films, the pair will have friction because of conflicting opinions. However, it seems like John Reid is one of those characters who never learns to change quick enough. It's sad to see because audiences want to feel sympathy for a character, but making him or her look like a jerk, becomes difficult to actually like the character as a person.Subplots are another thing that become unnecessary. A cursed rock is one of them. It was visited briefly, then retracted. Another one followed the idea that John Reid was secretly in love with his brother's wife. This wasn't given any real explanation why either. But the subplot that wasn't needed at all was the involvement of false accusations to the Native American Comanche tribe. Just to include them in the story for a staged action sequence is used for the wrong reason. I felt more sympathy for them than I did the U.S. Militia. These aren't small things that can be completely dropped from the conscience when viewing but there are pluses to the film. For one, I enjoyed the background story to Tonto. Fans of Depp at least get an understanding to why Tonto is the way he is. The action scenes are executed very well too. The best of them were the train scenes. Those, are always fun to watch because stopping a train is practically impossible. The cast is also fun too.Most audiences will remember William Fichtner as a ruthless scarred boss Butch Cavendish and Helena Bonham Carter as Red Harrington, a filly with some deadly legs. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography looks great too. Considering that he was the cinematography for Pumpkinhead (1988) as well, which involved western rural landscape, he was able to maintain his eyes on those wondrous shots after all these years. Editing is competent because the flow doesn't drag, although the direction isn't strong (as stated before) and it the running time is over 2 hours. Finally Hans Zimmer's score is all right too. He keeps the original main theme for the intro, finale and includes other tracks that are relative to the time but not much of it was memorable besides the theme. It entertains, but its story's weak.Depp no doubt is good as Tonto and there a number of other elements that help make the film fun, but much of the writing and direction is weak. For two and half-hours, you'd think the screenplay would be a little more clear with its information.",The Lone Ranger
82,p-stepien,Silver is OKaayyy!,6,10 October 2013,"This years Disney attempt to rekindle the legends of bygone eras is ""The Lone Ranger"", a western masked vigilante story, who attempts to revive itself in our new cynic world. Rewatching the original series of this masked avenger shows how far adrift we are of 1960s sensibilities and the Lone Ranger comes off as a walking self-parody. As such Gore Verbinski tries to overcome this inherent weakness, basically suggesting that various aspects of the original character are lame and laughing them off on-screen. Also the character of Tonto needed to be revamped and who better than Johnny Depp to fill in these boots, making him a strong lofty presence and counterpoint to the law-biding lawyer turned vigilante John Reid (Armie Hammer).Verbinski recreates the origin mythology of the Lone Ranger, strongly mixing it through Indian mysticism, represented by the wacko Tonto. Gawky law officer John Reid comes into town to witness the hanging of deranged cannibalistic criminal Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). During a daring escape Butch manages to evade execution, in the process eating the heart of Reid's only brother, ranger Dan (James Badge Dale). John himself is left for dead, but ultimately saved by the reluctant Tonto and a white spirit horse, who chose him to be her rider. Meanwhile, as Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) is building a railroad, a war with the Comanche tribes in the vicinity seems to be looming.At times effectively funny full with flamboyant action, at others just an overdose of spectacle with a touch of unintentional lameness, ""The Lone Ranger"" isn't the pathetic movie many imagine it to be, but at the same time it won't garner the same interest as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", simply due to the outdated egos of the protagonists. Johnny Depp once again molds out an eccentric character, but nothing as memorable as in many of his other portrayals and vastly inferior to Jack Sparrow in stature and significance. Tonto does have his moments, and as such proves the strongest comedic presence, even if a slightly faulty dramatic one. Depp seems to have hit a wall with this movie, increasingly becoming an amalgamate of his previous characters and struggling to find freshness. Depp's comedic timing is spot on, but it would serve him better to take a small break and focus on less flamboyant characters (maybe a couple of dramatic roles or a straight serving comedy?).William Fichtner works best in this movie with his despicably disgusting schwarz-character, who provides for a good object of hate throughout. Nonetheless the overriding fickleness of the dramaturgy, mainly due to John and Tonto lapsing in and out of being Laurel and Hardy make the movie disposable fun with limited enjoyment.",The Lone Ranger
83,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Hammer/ Depp in a bizarre mix of genres,4,14 January 2017,"A painfully unfunny wraparound story of Tonto, in the 1930s, maybe, narrating this story, his memoir, basically bookending this preposterously overlong, overcomplicated to the point of absurdity western/ comedy/ SciFi, taking place decades earlier...I can barely think clearly after this one.I like Armie Hammer, I have ever since I saw him in The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and I (usually) like Johnny Depp as well, but they are given the most oddball screenplay to work with here, as the film veers wildly from western genre, to zany slapstick, and I kept getting a science fiction vibe in a lot of the scenes, as there was so much of an overuse of CGI.The comedy elements are silly and juvenile, and occasionally tasteless (why do we see a horse taking a dump, only to see Hammer dragged through it?) and the action never looks real, the story lacks any sense of adventure, and I couldn't help wonder why we, as an audience, should care about any of this?I give it a 4/ 10, again, just because I like Hammer and Depp, and because the film does have some impressive looking cinematography in desert southwest, when it isn't drowning in CGI.",The Lone Ranger
84,brando647,Why All the Hate for THE LONE RANGER?,7,19 April 2014,"Man, this movie bombed big time. With a bloated budget of over $200 million, the movie never came close to earning its money back at the box office. It's sad too because I actually enjoyed THE LONE RANGER. What was with all the hate? I mean, I could understand a lot of the reasoning behind some of the venom spewed at some of the films this year. But THE LONE RANGER is nowhere near the level of garbage that was A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD. And a Razzie nomination? Come on, this movie wasn't that bad. The movie is based on the classic character that has spanned radio, movie, and television for decades. John Reid (Armie Hammer) is a lawyer who's traveling to Texas to join his lawman brother and bring a little law and order to the wild west. His arrival is interrupted when infamous outlaw and rumored cannibal Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) escapes custody and runs for the hills. John and his brother, Dan, form a posse and go after him but Butch sets an ambush, murdering the lawmen and leaving John for dead. But John's time isn't over and he recovers with the help of rogue Comanche warrior Tonto (Johnny Depp). John adopts the masked persona of the Lone Ranger, and he and Tonto embark on a mission to bring Butch to justice. But Butch isn't acting alone. He's following orders from a more sinister individual who plans on using the new railroad system to gain financial control and power over the burgeoning frontier.For starters, I'm a big fan of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchise and this movie shared the same writers and director as the first three films in that series. So, if you're a fan of the PIRATES movies, you should find that the storytelling style is pretty similar. A lot of grandiose set pieces and insane action with larger-than-life stunts and a bit of humor thrown in. It also shares the same unwieldy length of the PIRATES movies. THE LONE RANGER clocks in at nearly two and a half hours and, though I enjoyed it, I can see how that's enough to turn people off. That's a pretty long movie for a series that hasn't seen popularity in decades and is trying to find a new audience. It can be a lot to sit through and the movie does feel its length at times, particular in the midsection where it's cramming in loads of exposition about the evil men and their plan, as well as constantly building upon Tonto's history. Yeah, Tonto's not just a sidekick in this movie. He's a fully developed character and just as important as the Ranger himself, and he's actually more tied into the overall plot of the film than John Reid. I suppose it helps justify giving Tonto top-billing over the actual Lone Ranger in all the promotional materials (though it's actually because Depp is more likely to put butts in theater seats than Hammer). Depp as Tonto definitely has some Jack Sparrow flavor thrown in (or maybe that's just the usual Depp quirkiness) and some could argue that he's an odd choice to play a Native American. I mean, why not just cast an actual Native American? I admit it comes across as bit racially insensitive, and he spends the movie hidden behind face paint and a dead bird pinned to his head. But Depp's a fun actor and, even though he wouldn't be my first choice for a character like Tonto, he grows on you in the role.I suppose what I really enjoyed most about THE LONE RANGER was that it didn't treat itself as a joke. It's very much a western but it's got a contemporary feel that makes it a little easier for a non-western fan (like me) to enjoy. It's got a fun tone and, actually, a pretty engaging story. I'll be honest; I wasn't expecting much here. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a complex plot. I sat down expecting some generic, white hat vs. black hat cowboy shtick but the movie's actually got quite a bit going on. We've got Tonto's story (which ties heavily into the main plot) and railroad schemes with a handful of baddies coming at the Ranger from every direction, as well as a limp romantic subplot and wraparound segments featuring an aged Tonto telling the Ranger's story to some young kid at the fair. Which leads to my only real complaint with THE LONE RANGER. First, the love interest stuff just doesn't do much for me here. The woman is Rebecca Reid (Ruth Wilson), the recently widowed wife to the John's brother, and she's got a young son. Her character doesn't have much to do other than give John his motivation to rise against the railroad corruption. The movie feels it's length a quite a bit in the middle where we get the most Rebecca Reid plot filler. Cutting all of that or even just handling it better could've trimmed the movie by a solid half hour.I really don't understand all of the hardcore negative buzz around this movie. I know westerns don't really click with the modern generation but this one's got a strong cast and plenty of off-the-wall action to make it a fun time. It's got flaws but none worse than some of the other garbage in theaters. It's actually sort of disappointing because I wouldn't mind another adventure with the Lone Ranger and Tonto but the massive box office failure pretty much ensures that isn't going to happen.",The Lone Ranger
85,bob-rutzel-1,Who was that Indian with the Masked Man?,9,26 December 2013,"John Reid's (Armie Hammer) Texas Ranger brother, Dan, is ambushed and killed. John is badly wounded. and Tonto (Johnny Depp) tends to his wounds. John Reid takes on a mask – cut from his dead brother's shirt - to hunt down his brother's killers and he would be known as The Lone Ranger.Maybe the title should have been: Tonto and his friend the Lone Ranger. Folks, this is the Johnny Depp as Tonto show - make no mistake about that - with painted face and that bird on his head. We grew up with the Lone Ranger and we liked Tonto, but we didn't rush home from our play to listen (radio, folks, radio) to Tonto and his friend the Lone Ranger. We rushed home to listen to the Lone Ranger and we never saw Tonto with a painted face and a bird on his head until now. Creepy? Indeed. The REBOOT aspect of this is the relationship between Tonto and The Lone Ranger, who is treated like a dufus most of the time. Okay, all of the time. Now, The Lone Ranger is the side-kick. Not good. BUT, LET's GET REAL: The new younger audiences will only know THIS Lone Ranger and Tonto..um THIS Tonto and his friend, the Lone Ranger. This will become part of their ""good old days"" with more to come, I am sure. And, they will grow up and get weepy when they hear the question: who was that Indian with the Masked Man? No more will we hear: who was that Masked Man? We old-timers are being booted out! Such is life on this planet. Bummer !Still this is a very enjoyable, highly entertaining - with lots of action - movie despite differences with Tonto and that bird and painted face. The stunts and CGI were all terrific. I liked the way this started with the little boy in the western museum and elderly Tonto being a living character near a tepee in a desert setting and telling his version of The Lone Ranger story. This was reminiscent of the opening of LITTLE BIG MAN. Pretty good. A special shout-out must go to highly under-rated actor William Fichtner who was very good as bad-guy Butch Cavendish. Yes, he ate a human heart, but we didn't see it and that was a good thing. Also, we saw that Silver was probably smarter than all the characters in this movie. You will delight in seeing what this horse does from time to time. Very good. If he could only talk..Still, the real winner in here is the William Tell Overture. Nothing beats it. Nothing. But, we only heard it when the last hurrah was in process at the last battle. Always exciting. I don't know how much CGI was used when the action scenes with the trains were shown, but they were nothing short of fantastic. Hey, I had to duck many times. Also, the cinematography was excellent with beautiful photography of many desert landscapes. Yes, in many ways, this was disappointing, but if truth be told, I did chuckle at many of Tonto's quips. All we can hope for now is someone to come along and resurrect the classic Lone Ranger story as we – as kids – once knew it. We can only hope. Hi Yo Silver. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",The Lone Ranger
86,moviexclusive,"Bringing their 'Pirates' sensibilities to the Wild West, this is a rollicking action adventure full of eccentric charm, quirky humour, and big-action spectacle",8,1 July 2013,"If not for Johnny Depp, this big-budget revisionist interpretation of the classic 'Lone Ranger' character would probably never have happened. Sure, the baby-boomer generation of the 1950s might remember the popular TV show in which Clayton Moore was the titular character, but there is scarcely any trace left of the masked ex-Texas Ranger in popular culture half a century later. That reality isn't lost on Depp nor his 'Pirates of the Caribbean' director Gore Verbinski; rather than keep to the spirit of previous incarnations, their reboot essentially applies the sensibilities of their previous franchise-spawning 'Pirates' venture to the story of two outlaws in the Wild West. Notwithstanding the title, it is the Lone Ranger's sidekick Tonto who takes centre-stage here. His trademark eccentricity in glorious display, Depp's Tonto has a face painted white with four vertical black streaks and most distinctively, a dead crow perched atop his forehead which he obsessively feeds. Suffice to say that this is not the Tonto that Jay Silverheels used to play in the TV series; instead, this is a distinctively Depp creation, one that immediately recalls his Jack Sparrow kookiness but is yet more grounded and complex and in our opinion his most intriguing character part yet.Even though his behaviour and mannerisms are signature Depp, this Tonto retains the reticence of the original character and therefore speaks little and with much brevity. That characteristic isn't in any way a handicap though; instead, the witty script concocted by the 'Pirates' team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio along with Justin Haythe reserve the best punchlines for Tonto, which Depp delivers with sheer aplomb. In particular, Depp's deadpanning makes for great humour in the middle section of the film, which deliberately lets the action take a back seat in favour of some wry character bonding between Tonto and the Lone Ranger.Yet for the scene-stealer (or show-stopper even) that Depp is, one would not be able to do the film justice without due mention of the Lone Ranger himself. Setting aside his dramatic chops from 'The Social Network' and 'J. Edgar', Armie Hammer gives a straight-up performance as the clean-cut prosecutor turned Texas Ranger John Reid whose staunch belief in the code of law is tested by the wonton corruption that he witnesses. Reid's transformation from a lawman to an outlaw is the origins story that Elliott and Rossio want to tell, which along the way includes how the mask came to be as well as why his ""spirit horse"" is named Silver.Though Reid's quest for justice propels the story, Hammer knows better than to try to steal the thunder from Depp. Aptly therefore, he contends with being Depp's foil, as straight-arrow orthodox as Depp is idiosyncratically unorthodox. By being Depp's opposite, Hammer finds a sweet spot completing the odd couple-pairing that manifests itself both in their snappy repartee as well as some truly amusing physical moments. In particular, the latter forms a nice segue into the big-action climax, especially since that marks the first time our two heroes work side by side to stop what they finally realise is their common enemy.That enemy is none other than the sadistic criminal Butch Cavendish (played with dastardly menace by William Fitchner). Butch isn't alone as the villain here though; to up the stakes, the writers also throw in a railroad tycoon named Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) as well as a cavalry leader General Fuller (Barry Pepper) whom Latham enlists in his feigned war against the Red Indians in a bid to control the railroad and the riches to be found deep in Indian territory. That is a fair bit to set up, which explains the seemingly indulgent two-and-half-hour running time that in reality coasts by surprisingly swiftly.Besides the sheer charisma of Depp's character as well as to a lesser if no less significant extent Hammer's, the film manages to be consistently entertaining thanks in no small part to Verbinski. No stranger to the Western genre after successfully directing Depp in voice only in ""Rango"", Verbinski makes an effortless transition to live-action with the same derring-do that he amply demonstrated at the helm of the first three 'Pirates' movies. As with 'Pirates', he shows a deftness in navigating Elliott and Rossio's intentionally convoluted screenplay, which actually succeeds in giving Depp and Hammer the space for their characters to develop alongside each other while creating the right excuses for major action setpieces.Verbinski is of course no stranger to the kind of spectacle summer audiences want to see. Trading pirate ships for old-school coal trains, he begins with a literal bang as Tonto and Reid first make their acquaintance on board a hijacked train transporting Butch Cavendish to a New Mexico town to face punishment for his crimes. It is a jaw-dropping setpiece to say the least, even more so for the fact that it was shot for real instead of by CGI. But Verbinski sets aside the bulk of the coin for the climax, which can only be described as a glorious triumph in action choreography that pits good and bad in breathtaking fashion aboard two criss-crossing locomotives. Thrilling doesn't even begin to describe how exciting it is, given an elegant balletic touch by Hans Zimmer's rendition of Rossini's 'William Tell Overture'.And on that exuberant note, Verbinski more than convinces that his 'Pirates' treatment of the Lone Ranger classic is a resounding success. Not only does it pack the same level of exhilaration, it allows Depp an opportunity to yet again tap on his considerable pool of acting quirks to create a familiar yet wholly refreshing character. His Tonto is like no other Tonto yet seen, nor is it simply just a Jack Sparrow in the desert; therein lies the beauty of Depp's creation and even if it isn't Tonto's name you see on the title, it will be his that you will remember and reminisce fondly long after the credits are over.",The Lone Ranger

Tongue-in-check but definitely rated PG-13. It should have been more successful, but it got a very bad audience ""word of mouth"". Another ""John Carter-like"" misfire. Basically a good film that didn't find a big enough audience to make a profit. Over budget! Was it ""Tonto's"" pasty-white makeup, the critic's reviews, or the fact that ""The Lone Ranger's legend"" was unknown to most teenagers? An odd ending, as the Lone Ranger blows up the huge railroad bridge, yet gets a hero's welcome anyway for stopping the Comanche War? I love the use of the 1812 Overture and a hearty ""Hi-Ho Silver"".

88,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Muddled and misguided, but not a disaster.",5,25 January 2014,"Now the dust has settled and we can reserve prejudice of its infamous production, I hope the cast and crew are sighing with relief at those Oscar nominations. It's certainly a surprise after it got such a ferocious lashing at the box office and critics section. You'd think this was the antichrist. I never watched the original series of The Lone Ranger and I sincerely doubt that the rest of my generation have either. It was a bizarre choice to reboot with a budget this high but I guess a justifiable one if in the right hands. I quite like Gore Verbinski, particularly The Weather Man, the first two Pirates and Rango. He has a cinematic and playful style. His only severe misstep is the third Pirates which bloated way out of control and lost all sense of reality. Now his The Lone Ranger is definitely bloated too, but it's at a bearable Dead Man's Chest level rather than At World's End. It juggles three tones, soap opera melodrama, action-packed adventure and slapstick. Unfortunately with all these extremities, it can never find a way to blend them and it comes off as awkward and inconsistent.The film only relatively succeeds at its action segments though it's at the expense of the story. Even if its general image is unpleasant and too bleak; the dynamic cinematography, set design and visual effects are a blast without merely being an explosions-fest. Aside from the problematic script, the root of the reason this was never going to be a hit is Armie Hammer. I think he has potential, he was great in The Social Network especially. But there's something about him in The Lone Ranger that feels so bland and out of place that he comes off as whiny rather than empathetic. Perhaps it's simply because he's not strong enough to work off of Johnny Depp. That said, the amount of years since Depp has been compelling to watch is starting to fall onto the second set of fingers. I hope he can redeem himself soon, next chance is Pfister's Transcendence. Tonto is an odd role for him to choose, one that can easily be met with criticism at the mere combination, though I do appreciate references to one of my top ten favourite films Dead Man. Fortunately, he's not as bad as I expected, although there are hints of his eccentricities that are certainly the weak points in the performance.However, the film has the misfortune of casting Saving Mr. Bank's wife Ruth Wilson as the love interest, and I have a certain tolerance for looking at her miserable scowl that the film abuses. Let alone the weirdness of the main romantic subplot being a sister-in-law, I simply could not invest in the 'emotional' storyline. That's where the film's messages feel very uncomfortable in where its moral stances are - take your brother's wife, it's fine if he says so, don't worry? Is revenge almost definitely better than the justice system? I don't know if that's what it set out to do. It definitely wanted to take advantage of the western genre iconography in a half-assed study of binary oppositions with nature and man, technology and the past, but its observations are forced and far too on-the-nose. I guess we'll have to leave The Lone Ranger in the past for now, a film misguided due to Verbinski and Bruckheimer's bad habits. It seemed like it was the right hands but I guess we've been proved wrong. The film may be muddled, but not quite the disaster it's supposed to have been. Try again next generation.5/10",The Lone Ranger
89,michaeltrivedi,"Forget The Critics, This is Good",7,13 November 2019,"I really liked The Lone Ranger. It's an epic action adventure movie, though it did have a lot of slow parts.

90,Screen_Blitz,Overlong and bloated western action extravaganza offers little to satisfy,4,1 December 2016,"It's been nearly six decades since the iconic Texas Ranger met his debut on television fighting outlaws of the Old West with his trusted sidekick Tonto. Very few fans could get the famous television iconic would ever to make his appearance on his big screen. That is when visionary director Gore Verbinski, the incredible mind behind the 'Pirates of The Caribbean' trilogy comes into the scene to revive the titular hero along with his faithful sidekick Tonto. While his reimagining of the television series has the capacity of triggering nostalgia among those who grew up watching the series (or possible listening to the series on the radio back in the 30s), it's too often bloated and charmless in its execution leaving the entertainment factor have little to be desired. With Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp taking the spotlight, and a sweet six-digit budget; it should have been a whole lot of fun. Unfortunately, it's a hot mess. This film opens up in 1933 San Francisco where a young boy meets an aged Native American warrior Tonto (played by Johnny Depp) who tells him the long story of his adventures with the titular hero. Flashing back to the 1800s in the Old West, John Reid (played by Armie Hammer) is a Texas Ranger who travels across state with his brother Dan (played by James Badge Dale) to hunt down vicious outlaw Butch Cavendish (played by William Fichtner). When Cavendish's suddenly ambushes them and Dan is subsequently killed, Reid saddles up with Tonto who has escaped from jail to hunt down Cavendish and seek for justice.Gore Verbinski fetched his ingenious visionary to the 'Pirates of The Caribbean' trilogy as well as surprisingly successful animated film 'Rango' in 2011. Unfortunately, his attempts on revitalizing the iconic Texas Ranger come with less than stellar results that amount to an overlong western extravaganza that lacks excitement and heart until its final twenty minutes. The first big action scene takes place on a train where our titular hero is introduced. With guns blazing and train cars crashing and blowing to smithereens, there is enough adrenaline to pump up the excitement. But it's not before we're left in endure over two hours with our lead characters on a sluggishly paced trek through the Old West that goes tedious before halfway point, and constant tone shifts between it's light-hearted atmosphere and gritty somberness only make the already convoluted story more difficult to take seriously. In one scene, our heroes are cracking silly jokes, next scene they are engaging in some heavy action, another scene later a character viciously has his heart cut out. Though the actual act is not directly shown, doesn't that sound awfully gruesome for a Disney movie. In terms of the performances, Armie Hammer is not bad as the Lone Ranger nor is Johnny Depp as the Indian Tonto, especially with the stylish makeup done his face and his vintage Indian costume design. But their lack of charisma sadly render them into sorely forgettable protagonists. The main villain Butch Cavendish played by William Fichtner is also a bit of a one-dimensional letdown.The film doesn't quite reach much excitement nor does it incorporate much of the spirit of the titular hero until the final scene when our hero and his sidekick Tonto compete in an adrenaline-fueled showdown against Butch Cavendish and his gang. Not only does it take place on not one but two train racing by side by side, but we are blessed with the arrival of Giachino Rossini's classic score 'William Tell Overture' which if you remember was largely prevalent throughout the television series. There is plenty of fun to be handed as we watch our heroes pull off with eye-popping stunts with John Reid (now the Lone Ranger) racing on his horse aside the train and Tonto fending both against Cavendish's bandits in a tense, occasionally humorous close combat inside the train. It is just too bad that this climax couldn't have come sooner as we are forced to sustain through a long tensionless stretch of action-free mediocrity. Fortunately, this climatic scene along with the early train sequence is just enough to save the film from being too much of a bloated mess, especially for one running 149 minutes.The Lone Ranger is a bloated western action extravaganza piece that has little to offer beyond it's dazzling special effects and surface level performances. Though it may shine some light on its artistic production design and of course the near-inevitable nostalgia of its timeless source material, the overall execution makes it a difficult choice for replay value.",The Lone Ranger
91,cricket30,This flick has the geography of Texas all wrong . . .,7,3 September 2013,". . . as we do not have all those useless, ugly, unnecessary, unsightly pointy rocky things sticking up everywhere to interfere with our oil wells and longhorn cattle. Unneeded states such as New Mexico and Utah are bestrewn with fatuous phallic symbols such as those. Is it any coincidence that the film makers for LONE RANGER: THE MOVIE were afraid to undertake their less than truthful rendition of Texas history where it ACTUALLY HAPPENED, and fled to Utah and New Mexico to perpetrate their web of deceit? Furthermore, did anyone else notice that the parallel trains scene looks exactly like a Disneyland ride? Or that it is based on the cartoon DELGO? Or that it smacks of an Indiana Jones offering? Or that it passed right by a trainload of goblins on their way to the vault at Gringotts? Or that Johnny Depp would have been mistaken for Captain Jack Sparrow during this movie IF he had ever stepped next to any kind of an ocean-going boat? Or that about 200 of our finest boys in gray (or was it blue?) were massacred by these unpatriotic (is that a synonym for idiotic, or just a sound-alive?) film crew?",The Lone Ranger
92,RNMorton,Excellent,9,3 July 2013,"Hammer and Depp play well together in retelling of classic early television western. Hammer is district attorney sent back to his boyhood frontier town in the midst of ""progress"" - the linkage of continental rail service, dealing with the local Comanche tribe, and exploitation of silver deposits. Hammer is deputized when his brother, a Texas Ranger, needs a posse to chase the evil Butch Cavendish gang. Depp is solo Comanche shunned by his own tribe who is entangled in the various doings. Having Wilkinson as the local authority is worth at least one additional star, Depp is worth one or two extra stars himself for his very amusing if mildly predictable playing of Tonto. Some of the location scenery is spectacular. The movie doesn't quite make a 10 because it's a tad too long and the special effects are just a tad too unbelievable. But well done, and the telling of the story from Tonto's point of view is a bonus. There's nothing groundbreaking here but it's a fun ride.",The Lone Ranger
93,brchthethird,Unfairly maligned - it's actually pretty good despite being overlong,7,14 November 2014,"Despite the bloated running time and some unnecessary back story, Gore Verbinski and company manage to deliver an epic and fun Western with fascinating characters, incredible action set-pieces, beautiful cinematography and a rousing score by Hans Zimmer. First, I should say that anyone going in expecting a straight ""Lone Ranger"" movie will surely be disappointed. However, that kind of stoic ""good guy"" has long been out of fashion (as has the Western in terms of being a box office draw). What has been done here is framing the origin story of the Lone Ranger (and Tonto) as the recollections/ramblings of an aging (more like ancient) Tonto. Having Tonto be a (potentially) unreliable narrator lends a sort of fantastical realism to the proceedings and squarely positions the story as a fable or a legend, which works for the material. For the most part, the performances are good, but Johnny Depp stands out in particular. He brings his usual quirkiness, but also does some great physical comedy and deadpan humor. Armie Hammer is serviceable as the titular character, but this is proof (as if you needed any other) that he doesn't really cut it as a leading man. This is also evidenced by Johnny Depp getting the top billing. I also enjoyed a nearly unrecognizable William Fichtner as the fiendish Butch Cavendish. Other positives include some really cool action set-pieces involving trains, although they might have a gone a little overboard with the action. It was an exciting movie, nonetheless. On the downside, the script could have used some trimming/reworking. The major issue that most people will probably come away with is that Tonto is the main draw here instead of the Lone Ranger. So much so, that Tonto is actually given some back story, while the Lone Ranger is just presented as is. There is also some muddling when it comes to who the real villains are and what the ultimate goal is. You start off thinking that it might be some simple revenge story, but it (inevitably) ends up being much bigger, as studio blockbusters are wont to do. However, despite all of these shortcomings the movie is damned fun to watch. Just give it some time, and it's sure to be a classic of the Western genre. Imperfect, but earnest.",The Lone Ranger
94,maurice_yacowar,Great funhouse modern take on classic western fable.,9,5 July 2013,"First off, Johnny Depp doesn't play Tonto. Johnny Depp plays Dustin Hoffman's Jack Crabbe (Little Big Man, director Arthur Penn, Irving's younger brother, but that's another story) playing Tonto. That's Gore Verbinski's new take on The Lone Ranger in a nutshell -- where apparently most reviewers think it belongs. But as Sam Goldwyn would say, include me out. (Ever notice how contagious tangents and allusiveness can be?) In other words, Verbinski uses the old Lone Ranger story as a prism through which to survey the whole range of themes and conventions that made the perennially defunct classic Western not just America's most popular genre (on screens large and small) but (in part as a consequence) the outside world's favourite metaphor for America. This encyclopedia of the genre, with its trenchant socio-political analysis, still manages to be a constantly entertaining and exciting film. It provides the pleasures of the genre conventions even while anatomizing them. In short, I think this film is one of the all time great westerns. The scene with the two heroes talking, buried up to their heads, reminds us that this popular genre could rise to high art, as high as Beckett.

""Dark Shadows"" (2012) was a complete and total disaster. His ""Public Enemy"" (2009) would make Jimmy Cagney roll over in his grave. Now comes his very worst effort, ""The Lone Ranger"", which has no redeeming qualities at all. Like the dead crow that sits on his head, this film would lay an enormous egg if it had any life at all. The comedy is lame, the action is non-existent, and the story is just down right stupid. Even the music is outrageously awful.

97,rupie,skillfully executed leftist screed,2,30 June 2019,"I was intrigued by catching a few amusing glimpses as I channel surfed, so I recorded it and watched it later.I was drawn in at first by the tongue-in-cheek tone of the film, which seemed to promise a lot of fun with the moth-eaten Lone Ranger / Tonto shtick. And fun there was, with so many over-the-top special effects and deus-ex-machinas as to provide a lot of amusement, along with lots of wittily snappy dialog.However, as many, many viewers have said, the film can't make up its mind what it wants to be. We seesaw from moments of hilarious parody to scenes seemingly being played straight for suspense and terror. I would have opted for playing the humor flat out.Also largely unmentioned in the reviews I have read is that the whole flick is a cleverly and amusingly packaged compendium of all the au courant leftist agenda items. Anti-capitalist: check. Anti-development: check. Evil white oppressors: check. Noble savage: check. Greedy railroad barons: check. The not very subtle giveaway to all this is when, at the prospective moment of victory of all the nasty, top-hatted industrialists, the Star-Spangled Banner is played.I will give credit to the filmakers for, especially in the culminating scenes, coming up with a string of the funniest, most enjoyably ridiculous and over-the-top adventure sequences I gave seen on celluloid.

98,PartialMovieViewer,The Wrong Ranger,3,22 July 2013,"No more sequels - please. It is time to put this legend to rest. In the beginning it was a lot of fun; in the middle there was only despair and in the end there were very weak heroics. Johnny Depp, as always, is brilliant, the consummate comedic actor. It does not matter who or what he plays, I can't help but grin every time his face hits the screen. With that being said – he probably would not have been my first choice as Tonto – unless – of course - the movie was called, ""Tonto Ranger."" Armie Hammer – I am not familiar with him – but after seeing him – he should have gotten the roll as Superman in, 'Man of Steal.' He would have nailed the 'Superman' character and that Mild Mannered Clark Kent persona – he was too good at that. As far as, 'The Lone Ranger', he was way too wimpy and almost demanded being upstaged by 'Tonto.' William Fletcher, Ruth Wilson and Tom Wilkinson were all very good. Helena Bonham Carter is always brilliant – and was in this movie as well. It seems all the chemistry was present – but all the beakers and petri dishes were broken – and the end-result concoction was mediocre (with a few splashes of brilliance.) Talk about having the opportunity to make something great and then flushing it down the toilet. Granted – I found some parts to be totally hysterical (thanks to Depp and the rest of the cast.) Those mad bunny eating bunnies – I about rolled out of my seat laughing. But having such a talent as Armie Hammer, sitting on the sideline as the wimpiest cowboy (hero?)ever - was horrible. I think he is a very gifted actorbut for some reason, his character wasn't neededand I do not care what the name of the movie is. Wait. Ranting is not over. Please - either make a good comedy or a preachy, moralistic film – don't mix the two. Stop trick-fornicating your audiences – many of us can actually think as individuals. Movies are way too expensive to witness self aggrandizement from those 'on high.' I don't care about your guilt. OK – now I am done. Overall – the movie was pretty good – not worthy of a sequel. Sadly, the writing and/or directing was all over the place. Stay on track. The cast was brilliant – too bad some members were over-used, while some – almost ignored.",The Lone Ranger
99,TOMASBBloodhound,Impressive production design. Poor script.,5,4 July 2014,"This critic was not about to be swayed by all the negative buzz that helped sink this film last summer. Having been a fan of the Pirates franchise, I just could not believe this creative team could give us a film that would tank so badly..... and then I started watching it. True, a tidal wave of bad publicity can kill a film even before its released, as its makers claim. But Bruckheimer and Co. did not do themselves a favor with this rambling script devoid of humor. Where was all the snappy dialog that made me chuckle through the Pirates movies? Why give us such a wimpy lead as Armie Hammer? He looks the part, but there is nothing terribly dashing or heroic about the character they gave him to play. Depp seems too downbeat, almost as if he's trying too hard NOT to be Jack Sparrow. Hiding under all that make-up only serves to mute his personality and trivialize his Tonto character.The film's strengths are obvious from the get-go. The production design is outstanding, and the film looks wonderful. The stunt-work and special effects are terrific, too. With such a budget, they almost have to be by default. But what is missing? Why do we the audience not care about this story? First off, this is a very poorly-paced film. It takes its time getting everywhere. There is no reason this thing had to be longer than two hours. The villains are genuinely interesting, but somehow too obvious. Why do we have to travel through so much back story before we get any meaningful confrontations between the good guys and the bad guys? The Lone Ranger's brother seems like a far more interesting character than the Ranger himself, but he isn't around long enough for us to get to know him. Since nothing eventually comes of the implied relationship between the Ranger and his brother's widow, why is her character even needed? I know, I know... demographics.This film even pauses to revisit some of the oldest Hollywood clichés. The railroad and the U.S. Cavalry are always the bad guys. Indians are always the victim of white man's greed... yadda, yadda, yadda,... there is nothing new here. True or not, these themes have been driven into the ground so long, they are starting to push through the soil in China. At the end of the day, what are we left with? A huge box office flop, for one thing. I haven't noticed as many big budget movies released yet this summer. Perhaps these last two years with so many big-budget bombs has started the industry trending back towards original thought. I'm hopeful that new ideas may one day be allowed to craft themselves into major Hollywood productions like they once did in decades past.... but then I open the entertainment section of my local newspaper and see they have released ANOTHER FREAKING TRANSFORMERS MOVIE. Another Planet of the Apes. Another Godzilla.... another summer of crap. Oh, well. At least Klinton Spilsbury isn't making movies anymore! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Lone Ranger
100,Hollywood_Yoda,A Worthy Trip to Theaters,7,13 July 2013,"I hear people saying this movie did poorly. Well, let me tell you why it did poorly: first of all, its rated PG-13, which means parents are afraid to take their children to see it; secondly, it was up against a franchise from Dream Works Pictures (Despicable Me 2).Other than those reasons, the film is a success in the age range 18-39. If the film had been a PG rating, you could have seen the numbers soar closer to that of ""Despicable Me 2"". However, I am glad to see that Disney films have become edgier since the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was released a decade ago.Johnny Depp is okay in this film, not the greatest, not the worst (his voice is like Nicolas Cage's, it never changes no matter what movie or setting he's in).

102,petra_ste,Verbinski = worth watching,6,28 July 2013,"Gore Verbinski is one of those directors whose movies I never miss. Whatever flaws they might have, they all show craft and a genuine love for the medium.The Lone Ranger, like the second and third Pirates movies, is overlong, unevenly paced and often tonally inconsistent. It's also an entertaining western with some fine set-pieces - see the crackling last fifteen minutes - and a few poignant moments.Hammer and Depp complement each other well as, respectively, the titular goody-two-shoes hero and his zany Comanche companion, working together to stop a cannibal bandit, a railroad baron and an ambitious army officer. The cast is rounded up by veterans like Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter, the latter in a largely unnecessary role.Screenplay is often clunky. Much like in the Pirates movies, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have neat ideas but assemble them with much bloat and repetition. So we have three major set-pieces involving trains; two scenes where the Ranger stops Tonto from killing the villain; two scenes where the heroine attempts to escape... it feels like a still unpolished draft. Then again, Dead Man's Chest had two Kraken attacks, two set-pieces involving giant rolling objects, two martyred father figures... for Elliott and Rossio, if something is worth doing, it's also worth repeating.The many homages and nods to classic westerns - like the sound of cicadas chirping suddenly stopping as a sign of approaching threat, straight out of Once Upon a Time in the West - do not go unappreciated. And, although I usually detest framing devices, this time it actually serves a purpose and contributes to the bittersweet atmosphere of the ending.6/10",The Lone Ranger

Although its story tends to be and the evil doers certainly are, the main characters manage to be very funny in their quest which will prove to be quite unexpected at times. The special effects are really great as well as the action sequences, in compensation for a not so complex story which doesn't involve the amount of drama which I hoped for. The lone ranger, at least in the beginning is a complete idiot which ruins everything but will eventually become the much needed hero while the Indian maintains the atmosphere.

104,bryank-04844,'The Lone Ranger' suffers from not knowing what type of movie it ultimately wants to be.,2,23 August 2015,"Director Gore Verbinski borrows heavily from his animated Western 'Rango' and some other choice films for his latest mega-budget action adventure, 'The Lone Ranger'. In what seems to be a project greenlit only because Johnny Depp was willing to get into costume and makeup again, this remake is deeply flawed and way too long. Running two-and-a-half hours, the adventure flick could have been loads better with a full hour knocked off its running time.In addition to its length, 'The Lone Ranger' never realizes what type of movie it wants to be. It goes from over-the-top silly comedy to brutal violence all too often. The film stumbles all over the place tonally and never keeps an even pace. I know Verbinski, Depp and producer Jerry Bruckheimer want another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' type of franchise that will gross billions of dollars in film after film, but despite moments of thrilling entertainment, this movie may not make enough money to justify sequels.We've all seen or heard in some form about the Lone Ranger, his Indian partner Tonto and his majestic horse Silver. Almost 3,000 radio shows depicted the masked vigilante, plus an eight-year-long TV series and a couple of other movies that came before this $200 million project that's been scripted by the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' writing team.The film starts out in 1933 San Francisco, where a young boy dressed as a cowboy (complete with eye mask) enters a carnival overlooking the in-progress construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. He immediately goes to the Wild West tent and looks at the stuffed buffalos and giant bears that once ruled the plains. He ends up at a diorama titled ""Noble Savage"" that depicts a very old Comanche Indian with a dead black bird on his head. Take a closer look, and we see that it's a very heavily made- up Depp, who for some reason comes alive to talk with the boy about his past. This sets the scene for our story, as we flash back to 1869 where a younger Tonto first meets John Reid.I'm not sure why Verbinski and his writers decided to tell the story this way, but no reason is ever mentioned or hinted as to why the geriatric Tonto would suddenly come alive and spill his guts to a complete stranger, much less a kid. That aside, we first meet the District Attorney prosecutor John Reid (Armie Hammer) in a train full of churchgoers. In a separate car is the evil outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), who Reid is taking into town for justice. Sitting next to Cavendish is Tonto. When Cavendish's band of outlaws shows up and destroys the train to free their gang boss, Reid and Tonto finally meet.Now in Colby, Texas, John is reunited with his Texas Ranger brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and his wife Rebeccca (Ruth Wilson). The railroad owner Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) has taken a liking to the Reid family. Cole insists that Dan and his team of deputies head out to track down Cavendish and his outlaws and bring them back to town for hanging. Only after an hour into the film, after Cavendish guns down Dan and his men, does John put on the black mask and white hat, meets his horse, and teams up with Tonto to start their adventure.The next hour is chock full of scenarios seen in the TV series or heard on the radio show, including Tonto's origin story about being kicked out of his tribe, an evil scheme by Cavendish to steal Silver and build more railways, and a battle between the evil white men and the Indians (which mimics a climactic scene in one of the 'Lord of the Rings' movies). This all leads up to the last half hour, which is by far the best part and has the best action sequence in the movie (and is where we finally hear the famous ""William Tell Overture""). Unfortunately, by then, we're worn out and ready to go home.One thing I liked is that Verbinski spent a big chunk of the budget on building over six miles of actual train track and two actual trains to use while filming, instead of going the CGI route. The results look amazing. We haven't had a decent train adventure movie in a long time, and 'Lone Ranger' remedies that for train enthusiasts.Depp is great in the role as Tonto, but when isn't he ever great in anything he does? His performance is at times very dramatic as well as subtly comedic, and we never know what angle he's coming from. Armie Hammer isn't quite what I wanted the Lone Ranger to be. I usually love Hammer's work, but here, while he pulls of the straight-laced professional guy, he doesn't quite command the hero role so well, and the character gets lost in the other elements of the film. Fichtner pulls off the evil villain very well and is quite disgusting to look at throughout the entire movie. Wilkinson turns in a solid performance, and we get a brilliant cameo by Stephen Root. Of course, this having Johnny Depp in the film, Helena Bonham Carter has to show up playing a prostitute with a shotgun peg leg.'The Lone Ranger' suffers from not knowing what type of movie it ultimately wants to be. You can't have a brutal battle where thousands of Indians get slaughtered, then cut to a joke about a horse and killer rabbits. It doesn't work, and it throws the audience out of the dramatic moment. If you love Depp and don't mind sitting through a two-and-a-half hour movie that jumps around all over the place, go ahead and see this. If not, you might want to wait for video.On an end note, the kill-count in this Disney film might be larger than all of the Rambo movies combined.",The Lone Ranger

The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Johnny Depp stole the show for his portrayal of Tonto, I thought. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast.",The Lone Ranger
106,jdkraus,Generic and fun...take it what its worth,7,19 July 2013,"It is a treat when Hollywood decides to remake an icon that has been in society's core for decades. The Lone Ranger has been seen both in TV and in books for children. From memory, the legend of the Lone Ranger was about a masked outlaw who was a heroic idol against crime and corruption in the Wild West, aided by his Indian sidekick Tonto. Gore Verbinski's take on such a figure seems more or less inclined to flip the coin. This is hardly surprising, Johnny Depp, in a supporting role? Horsehockey! The man can immerse himself into any role. He very well could have played the Lone Ranger (despite his age), but appears more suited in out of the ordinary characters like Tonto. I am sure some people will find it offensive that a white man portrays an Indian (it has been done before). Even so, Depp brings a fresh breath in his performance as Tonto. He is matter-of-fact, the voice of reason in the movie, and yet funny with his dead pet bird and deadpan delivery of one-liners. Armie Hammer as John Reid, later dubbed the Lone Ranger kind of blends into the background. He is not a bad actor (just watch him in The Social Network), but he feels out of place here. This is most likely because Depp has such a strong screen presence that Hammer lacks. Armie needs more time before he can make it to the caliber of Depp. It is also because of how his character was written for the film. Instead of the gallant vigilante American citizens have come to see the Lone Ranger as, he performs as a clumsy, inexperienced, die hard, pacifist law man. Some of his unexpected incidents at times can rival the nature of the naive and clueless Dudley Do-Right. I should give the writers and his character some credit though, every hero starts out somewhere. His just happens to be a lucky and unlucky fool. Two hours later into the movie though, he finally gets his act together as he takes on an army of bad guys on two separate moving trains heading towards destruction.The supporting cast is pretty good. William Fitchner plays a great villain who has a hard-on for killing men and eating hearts (yes his character is that vile). Tom Wilkinson meshes in as a decent, crooked businessman, Ruth Wilson is a fine-looking damsel in distress, and the clever quirks of Helena Bonham Carter as a one-legged prostitute in an outrageous wig and costume plays out nicely. I just wished they have Carter more screen time. Her character is just that much fun. The plot itself is quite generic. Good versus bad, justice vs. corruption, greed vs love, good narrative versus clichés, twists vs. predictability, etcetera, etcetera. But for its 149 minutes, it drags. I wouldn't quite say it was boring, it just felt long, which is quite shocking for a Gore Verbinski film-his movies no matter their length always fly by. The interludes of fantastic, CGI-laden action sequences help break the slowness without being overbearing like so many action flicks today. The production qualities really help this film. The cinematography is absolutely stunning; the master shots of Monument Valley is awe-inspiring, no doubt bringing back memories of the old John Ford films. The music score has a slight mix of Spaghetti Western meets ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". But most of it feels original and echoes both the bombastic heroism and emptiness of the violent, barren landscapes. On a side note, the William Tell Orchestra is cued for the final action sequence. Old fans of the TV show will certainly get a kick out of this. The set pieces and costumes are exquisite and the make-up design for all the characters is phenomenal. I can only imagine how many hours Depp had to spend in the make-up chair for old Tonto. Overall, ""The Lone Ranger"" is all not that terrible. It probably received bad ratings because it did not old up to their high standards of originality and a great actor playing the Lone Ranger. Instead, this is a fun, generic, action flick with Johnny Depp at a masterful level. I am pretty biased. I will see Mr. Depp in any movie, no matter what make up or costume he wears. 7/10",The Lone Ranger
107,Prichards12345,"I quite enjoyed this - overlong but pretty good,",6,3 January 2014,"Got this on blue-ray for my better half for Christmas - she's a fan of all things Depp and I thought she'd enjoy it. After watching the cgi-infested trailer at the cinema I thought I'd be in for yet another brainless Hollywood action romp. Happy to admit The Lone Ranger is far better than that.For one thing, there are plenty of quieter moments and the action scenes are carefully built up to. The relationship between John Reid (A likable Armie Hammer) and Tonto (Depp, as enjoyably batty as ever) is well developed and played for comedy. The movie does have some serious beats, too, as Reid, a lawyer who refuses to initially carry a gun in Texas, (about the only guy who didn't, then!) sees his brother killed and sister-in-law and nephew kidnapped.Largely this is a nicely told tale. Some of the action is ridiculous, but some of it is also splendidly done. Silver, the Lone Ranger's horse, displays an over-fondness for alcohol along the way and a penchant for getting into a lot of places no ordinary horse would go! It's broad but fun.The film's a bit too long, but Gore Verbinski seems to have learned from His Pirates Of The Caribbean movies and not made it over-busy. In short better than I expected and nowhere near as bad as the critics say.",The Lone Ranger
108,jessegehrig,"Studio heads should let writers write movies, instead of writing it themselves",4,31 July 2014,"Entertaining. Has major first and second act trouble. The third act seems to be the movie's strongest part. From what I would read about this movie before it's release, the date kept getting pushed back and pushed back. Also they changed directors, maybe, certainly there were issues the studio had with the movie's tone so I think the movie got more than just one final edit, which is rarely a good sign. I could be wrong on all of that, but what I do know is that what I saw was an uneven movie. Whatever behind the scenes troubles this movie may or may not have had, on the screen I saw a movie that felt very pieced and stitched together rather than some fluid thing. The third act though works, so there you have it, that's the movie, act 1 off act 2 off act 3 works.",The Lone Ranger
109,ersinkdotcom,"""The Lone Ranger"" rides into theaters and gives audiences an action-packed, but slightly flawed, good time",8,2 July 2013,"Disney certainly has their hands full these days. It seems like the Mouse House owns the rights to almost every successful franchise on the planet. You've got Marvel Comics characters, the world of Oz, the Muppets, ""Star Wars,"" and now ""The Lone Ranger.""Most Disney films do quite well at the box office, but every now and then a flop comes along. Even though I loved the movie myself, the studio considers ""John Carter"" to be a miserable failure. Westerns don't do very well in the theater these days. One would think a producer investing in a movie about a masked outlaw and his Indian companion in the Old West would work out about as well as putting the money in a few bags and throwing it into a fiery furnace. Apparently, not if the Indian happens to be Johnny Depp and the director is ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" helmsman Gore Verbinski.John Reid rides along with his Texas Ranger brother to track down a ruthless bandit. After the group of lawmen is killed in an ambush, Reid is left for dead. Native American Tonto finds the injured Reid and nurses him back to health. It's now left up to the unlikely union of these two very different men to track down the killer of Reid's brother and bring him to justice.Are American audiences ready to accept an old-fashioned Western? I think they are. Especially if it's disguised as a summer action / adventure blockbuster from explosive producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Johnny Depp is leading the way. And let's be honest, Johnny Depp IS leading the way. He commands every scene he is in and his presence overshadows Armie Hammer's.The movie might be called ""The Lone Ranger,"" but its Tonto telling the tale and he basically guides the title character throughout. The hero's Indian friend saves his life countless times and even creates the masked alter ego. The Lone Ranger just sort of eeks his way through all the trials and tribulations thrown in front of him.By no means am I saying I didn't like ""The Lone Ranger."" It's packed full of great action sequences and delivers all sorts of thrills. Armie Hammer does a great job showing the difficulty his character of John Reid has taking on the role of the Lone Ranger. It's a true origin story, showing a man's burdensome transformation from proper lawyer to gun slinging servant of justice.I enjoyed how ""The Lone Ranger"" felt like a true Western. Every character was dirty throughout the entire film. There were no fashion cowboys to be seen anywhere. All the sets looked genuine and what CGI there was blended well with the actors and props. It was a well-made and believable period piece that will age gracefully. I was surprised by the amount of violence in the film. The movie wasn't overly gory, but was graphic. There's a lot of deaths portrayed on screen. Parents should definitely heed the PG-13 rating.One thing that bothered me in the movie was when a lady asks John Reid if he wants to sing church hymns with her and he replies that his book of the law is his Bible. He insinuates he doesn't believe in God. That goes against the moral code laid out by ""Lone Ranger"" creators Fran Striker and George W. Trendle. One of the masked hero's creeds reads, ""I believe in my Creator, my country, my fellow man."" Of course this happens before he turns into the Lone Ranger and realizes that his idea of serving justice doesn't always work. Maybe he has a change of heart when he accepts his destiny.""The Lone Ranger"" delivers plenty of action and a solid storyline which, though predictable, will hold the viewer's attention. I just hope that if there is a sequel, we'll get more of the Lone Ranger with our Tonto. Next time, let's have a fully trained and action-ready masked avenger who can hold his own. I understand there had to be some character development in this origin film, but let's move on now that we have all that established.",The Lone Ranger
110,Likes_Ninjas90,Something as mindless and overblown as The Lone Ranger manages to resurface a lot of the same questions about political correctness,3,1 July 2013,"There was a time when Hollywood didn't use Native American actors to play Indians in their films. White actors, only some of which had Indian heritage, were cast to play the natives. When Elvis Presley was cast as an Indian he at least had some Native American blood in his family. Actors like Elvis were cast because of their star power as no one at the time wanted to see Indians playing Indians. Undeniably worse than the 'redface' phase was the way that Indians were vilified as the original baddies of America - primitive savages who would stop the country from striving closer to modernity and civility. As early as John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), Indians were great cannon fodder for the heroic cowboy to shoot down in the Western. Since the birth of the Western genre, Indians have been either viewed as savages or having a mystical connection to the land. We've grown to know more a lot more about their culture, the inaccuracies of Hollywood dressing them in feathers for one, but something as mindless and overblown as The Lone Ranger manages to resurface a lot of the same questions about political correctness - unintentionally of course. The character of the Lone Ranger is taken from a 1930s radio serial, which eventually spawned a TV show and several movies. The first Ranger movie since the 1980s also marks the fifth teaming of Johnny Depp and the director Gore Verbinski, whose attitude to filmmaking is that more is always more. Pirates of the Caribbean is his most popular franchise, but also his most gratuitous. The animated film Rango is arguably the cleverest and best film he's directed recently because the lunacy didn't prevent the script from telling a funny, layered and cohesive story. The Long Ranger is more like Pirates than Rango and from all accounts Verbinski's lack of restraint finally caught up with him. The budget for the film was said to have blown out to $250 million dollars and it was rumoured to have taken close to 150 days to shoot the film. Depp also had to prove that he was partly Native American. It's in his blood apparently as he says that his grandmother grew up as either a Cherokee or Creek Indian. He also said that he wanted to right the wrongs of the past by making Tonto more than just the sidekick, which accounts for why he was a producer on the film. However, many of the production's issues converge together in the final cut, which is every bit a product. Tonto (Depp) is an old Indian telling a young boy a story through a framing device recalling the movie Little Big Man (1970). The idea is that the film is meant to be his crazy recollections of his partnership with John Reid (The Social Network's Armie Hammer), who is a lawyer turned masked avenger, hunting down the outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). The storytelling device is meant to show the inaccuracies and exaggerations in the story, but I doubt that without this the film would be more restrained and less ridiculous.At a glacial running time of 150 minutes, the chase sequences in the film drag on forever and make no accountability for spatiality and physics. Spare a thought for the poor horse that had to run up and down the top of the speeding train. A muddled plot is structured around long setpieces and estranged episodes, including Helena Bonham Carter as a brothel owner with a gun in her boot, Tom Wilkinson as a suspicious railroad tycoon and a tragic backstory for Tonto. Yet no care is taken to make a cohesive whole out of these elements. The story is so convoluted that I lost engagement between trying to decrypt the conspiracy and hearing the dialogue over the muffled accents. Verbinski doesn't grasp a steady tone either. The film spirals purposelessly from a screwball buddy comedy to outright slapstick, and then into a violent Western. Depp has made a career from playing kooky oddball characters, his multiple personalities are often extraordinary, but this character borders on being culturally insensitive and lacks charm. Despite his Indian blood he still has to play the act for laughs as the crazy Indian, not with feathers, but a bird stuck on his head. One of the few impressions made by Armie Hammer's Ranger is that he prefers a non- violent approach and is reading John Locke's Two Treaties of Government. It's a philosophical publication about liberty, equality and the assigned roles of government. Fittingly though, there's only one character allowed to read it here.",The Lone Ranger
111,Christian_Dimartino,"It's dumb, predictable, loud,long, and familiar... but it's still not that bad.",6,15 July 2013,"I will go see Johnny Depp in anything. But when I heard that The Lone Ranger was terrible, I am sad to say that I wasn't exactly surprised. Lately, it seems as if he has been doing too much of the same thing, and since he's so good at it, he probably feels like America will accept it. Since Alice in Wonderland, he has done nothing but these wacky characters, and he's good at it, so we watch it. But I think it's time he tries something new.The Lone Ranger, which is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Gore Verbinski (the team behind the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy) have brought us something new. But is it? The Lone Ranger is pretty much Pirates of the Caribbean, set in the Old West. Some of the jokes are similar, some of the settings are similar, some of the characters are similar, some of the scenes are similar. But yet, I still didn't think it was that bad.Armie Hammer, somewhat out of place here, plays the title role. His name is John Reid, a lawyer who is promoted a Texas Ranger by his brother, and with the help of a Native American named Tonto (who do you think? Johnny Depp, of course, doing his thing), he must track down an vicious, and somewhat cannibalistic, outlaw named Butch Candevar (William Fichtner).As I said, it does have that sort of Pirates of the Caribbean-ness. It's even from the same writers. And I'm not saying that it doesn't work (everyone else begs to differ), but it isn't exactly inspired. The same goes for Depp performance. Depp does save the movie, though we've seen him do this before. Depp is one of the greatest actors alive, and we never get tired of him. I did laugh at during this movie, but it is the loudest movie since Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Also, it is about a half an hour too long, and it is sort of dumb. But I still recommend it. Well, I think it's worth a rent. It's fun. Yes, all of the flaws mentioned apply, and it is also very predictable. But I had fun, and clearly the cast has fun too. But hopefully Depp's next movie doesn't require him to wear any makeup. Then we will know it's a serious performance. His next movie is Transcendence, a sci-fi from first time director Wally Pfister (Christopher Nolan's cinematographer). Then after that he's doing Pirates of the Caribbean 5. I understand Verbinski and crew are just trying to give the audience what they want... but if we want Pirates of the Old West, then call it so.B-",The Lone Ranger
112,Shopaholic35,Give it a chance.,7,20 February 2015,"The Lone Ranger has heavy influences from ""Wild Wild West"", ""Back To The Future Part III"" and the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"". As you can imagine it is jam-packed with plenty of action and kooky characters. Forget the bad rep this movie got as it's actually very entertaining. I wouldn't say there were heaps of funny moments but I don't believe it was actually supposed to be a comedy.Johnny Depp certainly loves his headscarf and hair beads combo. If he wasn't an Indian then he would look like an idiot. I kinda feel like he recycled his Jack Sparrow character but it works. Besides he is a fantastic character actor so I won't hold this against him.This is a somewhat lighthearted movie and shouldn't be overanalysed.

114,Antagonisten,Why the long film?,6,17 July 2014,"I often wonder these days why Hollywood persists in making films that are over two hours long, regardless of the subject or genre. This is a prime example of this problem. An adventure movie needs speed, comedy, action and the drive to keep things interesting despite a usually thin script. This movie is passable as far as adventure movies go, but you could easily trim 45 minutes from it without really removing anything of note.Acting is OK without being anything special, Johnny Depp is his usual self, lazy and not really interested any more. Armie Hammer is as stiff as the part demands. Tom Wilkinson has the kind of bad-guy role he could excel at in his sleep, Helena Bonham Carter is...well, Helena Bonham Carter. The script is wafer-thin, special-effects and production values are above par. There is not really much left of the original Lone Ranger-stuff, you don't even get the famous theme-music until quite close to the end. But all in all, the movie is fairly enjoyable as long as it lasts, but easily forgotten once it's over.If they had just trimmed those 45 minutes away, this could have been really enjoyable.",The Lone Ranger

It's got everything you'd want from a summer movie, including lots of humour, lots of action and adventure (especially on fast moving trains), great scenery, stirring music, ornery villains, taciturn rangers, a dashing hero, a strange horse, and, er, a crazy Injun.Admittedly, the movie is a little too long. Hence the 7 rather than an 8. Perhaps it could have been tightened up a bit. The last half hour of the movie is the best.Depp and Hammer made a great team. Depp is one of the most interesting and talented actors of our generation. However, even if you don't particularly like Depp, you'll enjoy this film.Also, you don't have to know anything about the Lone Ranger to enjoy the film.The portrayal of native Americans is sensitive, in my view.

There are some pretty violent and dark elements to the film yet it tries to be funny, I say try because it is not in the slightest bit funny. Towards the end I just wanted it to finish and didn't care how. The film reminds me of Wild, wild west as that could have also been a good film but got carried away with silly special effects thinking that it could mask an awful plot.I will never get back the almost two hours I wasted on this tripe!",The Lone Ranger

118,Rickting,Leave the film alone,7,12 February 2014,"Disney's latest live action blockbuster flop is Pirates Of The Caribbean in the wild west. This movie has tanked at the domestic box office and critics were trashing it. The Lone Ranger is about a man becoming a legend as he pursues an outlaw across the wild west. The Lone Ranger is an interesting case. 2013 was a bad summer for films, with the best of the summer (The Conjuring) not even being a blockbuster. This was also released, and is quite likely the best summer blockbuster of last summer, yet critics, just because it had an inflated running time and big budget, decided to trash it. Don't listen to all of those who can't handle an inflated budget. The Lone Ranger, while overlong and bloated, is a fun, insane and gleefully unrestrained movie with plenty of humour, dazzle and stunning visuals. It isn't a great film. The running time of 150 minutes is unnecessary, and the film can feel crowded with the various elements, plot lines and what feels like 3 separate finales fighting for attention. Arnie Hammer is too understated, while Johnny Deep acts like a clown throughout and is pretty much Jack Sparrow in white face paint.However, what critics failed to acknowledge is that the cinematography is excellent, and the action sequences are genuinely spectacular. The film nails the right tone, with plenty of genuinely fun jokes, a sense of escapism and even some more serious emotion in it, and it's not so much an adventure movie as a full throttle train smashing through the blockbuster garbage of 2013 to deliver an exciting thrill ride which provides genuine entertainment and has a strong sense of fun. This is one of those fairly rare occasions where you should ignore the critics completely, as they were reviewing the budget- not the movie. Despite the fairly weak performances and excess of ambition, TLR is certainly better than the POTC sequels and while most don't realize, is actually a relative triumph for Disney. Just watch with an open mind and you'll find yourself having fun in no time.7/10",The Lone Ranger
119,TheSquiss,"Messy, confused & reasonable fun. Wild Wild West for the 21st century.",6,23 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger arrives with huge expectation. Director Gore Verbinski's trilogy of Pirates of the Caribbean films (the fourth installment was directed by Rob Marshall) have generated a couple of billion dollars at the box office (and the first one was even pretty good), and having raked in the cash four times he previously worked with principal star, Johnny Depp, what could possibly go wrong? Much the same was said about Barry Sonnenfeld's second film with Will Smith, Wild Wild West. I'm going to leave that comparison with you. Think about it for a while.The Lone Ranger opens with attractive, sweeping greenscreen shots before settling on a boy wandering through a Wild West exhibition. Said boy is entranced by an exhibit of a wrinkled man with a dead crow on his head. The old man's eyes move and suddenly we are transported back in time to 2006 and Night at the Museum. The man in question is an aged Tonto (an unrecognizable Depp swathed in latex) and he proceeds to tell the boy about his adventures with John Reid aka The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer). It works as a device to kick-start the film but rankles as he becomes a frequent narrator when Verbinski is unsure how to link scenes.Reid returns to his hometown with a suit and a law degree, very much out of place in a town of chaps, spurs and Stetsons. His lawman brother, Dan (James Badge Reid) realizes there is still an attraction between his wife, Rebecca (Ruth Wilson), and John, and promptly removes temptation by deputizing him. The posse sets off in pursuit of outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and one shootout later they inhabit seven graves dug by the young Tonto. However, Tonto doesn't reckon on the interference of the white spirit horse.The scenery is a perfect backdrop to what should be a fantastic film and though Verbinski can take no credit for the mountains and plains, he does utilize them beautifully. Furthermore, Verbinski has also recruited some fine actors to propel his film along. Fichtner is deliciously villainous as Cavendish and one silently boos with relish every time he appears.Equally, Helen Bonham Carter is feisty, sexy and lots of fun as Red Harington, the mistress of the house of ill repute. What a pity she plays so little part in proceedings. With a hefty pair of scissors at least 30 minutes and various minor characters could have been excised from The Lone Ranger and more time given to characters with real bite and who have more to say and a far more entertaining way of saying it.Despite being far, far too long (it's not about minutes; it's about 90% of the audience fidgeting because their minds have wandered home without their bodies), the biggest issue with The Lone Ranger is that nobody seems quite certain what type of film it is. Depp tries hard to deliver an off-kilter character that doesn't resemble Jack Sparrow too closely but looks uncomfortable, while the direction is inconsistent in its variation of action, thriller and Wild West pantomime. My overriding thought was that somebody had spliced together Wild Wild West and 3:10 to Yuma and ended up with this mess.Hammer looks good as the titular character but he, too, wavers between chiseled hero, bumbling foil and slapstick sidekick. Besides, this is very obviously the Johnny Depp show.The finale, when at last it trundles along the rails into sight, is almost thrilling and gives the William Tell Overture an extremely good workout but the same problems persist: it lacks a brave editor and the tone is mixed up. Much of the action is exciting but nowhere near sharp enough and the humour occasionally raises a smile but mostly falls flat. It's such a wasted opportunity.It certainly helps to enter the cinema with very low expectations though, rest assured, The Lone Ranger isn't the dire flop some would have you believe. However, I'd advise you to have Wild Wild West in mind before you approach it.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",The Lone Ranger

Granted, it had its issues but I didn't think it killed any entertainment I was getting out of it.While it took awhile for me to get behind the guy, I thought Armie Hammer was really entertaining as The Lone Ranger. For a majority of the film, I thought he was a little annoying as the character was a bumbling fool and I think the development of turning him from a coward to a legend wasn't handled the best but, by the end of the movie, I was fully invested with Hammer as the fabled hero of the West. He was backed up tremendously by Johnny Depp as Tonto and William Fichtner as the villain Butch Cavendish.The story, at times, started to get too long and the movie ended up dragging but thanks to very exciting action sequences, I quickly forgot about the dragging parts and I, ultimately, just had a great time watching the film and really hope a sequel gets made (even thought, realistically, it's not happening).Hi!

If it was meant to be a family film (Disney specialties) then it was far too violent and the villains were not the usual semi-comic type but psychopathic monsters. Johnny Depp cannot base his entire career on being an oddball character if he is to be respected as an actor and Armie Hammer is just not talented enough to carry a movie .

123,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Limited Western Comedy w/ Epic Runtime,4,4 July 2013,"Anyone familiar with the Comedy/Western LITTLE BIG MAN will recognize the first ten minutes of THE LONE RANGER... The main character, noticeably aged, tells the story we're all about to see: It's Tonto spinning a yarn to a gullible young tyke – and yes, the quirky Native American's even more important than John Reid, played by Armie Hammer, a young lawyer so honest you'll want to knock his block off. Well Tonto sure does... And we don't have to wait long for the best sequence: an action-packed train escape where the duo, chained together at the wrists, survive the impossible... and then some. Here Director Gore Verbinski moves the action along with sublime finesse – but there's a long two hours to go.Johnny Depp's Tonto is a little like his PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN Captain Jack Sparrow. During any situation he can be relied on for dry wit – but here he plays it a bit too dry. Seeming like an intentional imitation of those old school ""Indian"" characters, with halting speech trying to over-pronounce each word, Depp gets stuck with a one-note expression: balancing dimwitted surprise and world-weary agile. Like the film itself it's never clear if he's silly or serious; brave or banal. And with a caked white face striped with black streaks, resembling a chocolate swirl cookie, and a dead crow strapped to a grungy turban, the preposterous costume, attempting to define his character, ultimately hinders the performance.Meanwhile a square-jawed Hammer plays Reid – the miraculous ""survivor"" of a massacre brought to life to fulfill destiny – like a naive dork with such stubborn idealism he's begging to come around to a more primitive, vengeful outlook. Up against William Fichtner's cutthroat Butch Cavendish and another unnamed villain (whose nefarious intentions shouldn't be spoiled), with Tonto's help he eventually morphs into a bonafide superhero, mask and all.With a two-and-a-half hour run time, including a bloated midsection replete with far-fetched mysticism, tedious bouts of backstory/dialogue, and a preachy message against ""progression,"" perhaps a leaner, tighter pace would make this a lot more involving and less of a chore. Thankfully, during the William Tell blaring climax, we get another cool train sequence to make one forget (and partially forgive) all the downtime in-between.",The Lone Ranger
124,The_Light_Triton,Anyone hoping this will be loyal to the original will be disappointed.,7,20 August 2013,"The story of the lone ranger dates back to the 30's when the days of the wild west had ended and the days of world war 2 were to begin. around this time, people would listen to the radio for entertainment. but the one program that everyone seems to remember and won't ever let die, is ""The Lone Ranger."" It was in 1949 that the lone ranger was adapted into a TV show. for years it was on TV, telling the stories of the masked ranger and his Indian friend, Tonto, and how they brought justice to criminals in the days of the lawless west. 12 episodes fall into public domain and are readily available to be seen on youtube, although other episodes air sporadically on the Memorable Entertainment Television network.Then in 1991, the lone ranger was adapted into a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. To this day, the game is highly sought after but not rare.Now, skip to 2013. This is Disney's attempt at telling the story of the lone ranger. and it's one of those movies that totally separates fans. there are fans that enjoy the comic relief the movie has to offer, other fans are happy Disney spent a quarter of a billion dollars to only make back a fraction of that, because the film itself is like a big middle finger to the original programs.The story is told by Tonto, who is still alive in 1933 as a frail Indian man who works for a travelling circus as part of their ""Wild west"" display. When a young boy dressed in a cowboy hat and mask walks in and sees Tonto on display, Tonto immediately recalls his glory days as the lone ranger's companion, as they tracked down the outlaw Butch Cavendish.First, i'll state the obvious. the original Lone Ranger was more serious and wasn't meant to make people laugh. This one has a lot of comical moments, but i'd much rather see that in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. And by the way, this movie was made by the same guys.Second, The original plot of how the ranger came to be was about 50% different from how this movie told it. For one, there were 6 rangers who rode into the canyon instead of 7 and John Reid was not a lawyer. Tonto knew John from long before and he and him were friends.Third, and this one really irritates me - the true meaning of the phrase ""Kemo Sabe."" According to the original 1949 TV series, It means ""Trusty Scout."" However, in this movie, Kemo sabe apparently means ""Wrong Brother"" but this is probably a sarcastic joke by Tonto.So to sum up this movie, If you like the dream team of Jerry Bruckheimer (Director) Hans Zimmer (Musical Composer) and Johnny Depp (Actor) then maybe you'll enjoy this. If you love the original TV show starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, Then you'll probably hate it.I give it a 7/10.",The Lone Ranger
125,osj2507,"I haven't seen the original, so this introduction was very nice",6,20 July 2015,"I like the characters and the scenery, I like that the story is told by the Indian to a child and that everything can be interpreted as either an old mans story or fairy tale or the young kids imagination running wild.I think it for most of the time was a very entertaining film, but it didn't have to be two and a half hours, they could have cut it down a notch and spared some of the slow scenes. But it is a good one with many great scenes and good fighting, not that much western shooting thought :)Tonto is a special character and the characteristic is based on his own story and the imagination of the kid, so this makes for an interesting yet a bit crazy part for Johnny Depp (I'm sure that is how we wanted it :D). Arnie Hammer also does a great job at being the scared law man and the more confident Lone Ranger, but his character is a bit more grounded and that makes them a rather odd but also funny team. The performance of William Fichnter is great, he is a bad-ass and doesn't care about others then himself, he looks and feels pretty much as a western outlaw and I am sure he smells that way too :)Entertaining and fun, a bit to long and missing some elements to really make it a block buster, but I had fun and it fitted nicely for a quit evening.",The Lone Ranger
126,richieandsam,Not bad but not great.,6,27 March 2014,"THE LONE RANGERI know this was slated by almost everyone when it first came out, but I like to make my own mind up on a film.The movie is about a solicitor in the Wild West who moves to a new town where his brother is the deputy. They are all trying to catch a criminal who is going around killing everyone in his path. When the solicitor gets saved by a white horse and an Indian, he hides his identity to get revenge on the criminal.It's not as bad as I was expecting, but it was not a great film. The movie is made by Disney so was thinking it will be a childish film, but it actually wasn't that much. There were a few scenes which I thought were a bit too much for young children one of which a guy eats the heart of one of his victims. You don't actually see him eating it, but it was obvious enough to scare little children.The story was OK really, but nothing original. The action scenes were quite good and a lot of fun to watch and the comedy was very average.The movie stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer. Armie did a pretty good job. He was funny in places and performed his role really well. Johnny Depp played Tonto. I was fully expecting this to be another Jack Sparrow role, but it wasn't really. I thought he did really well. I like the way he can play pretty much any kind of character. William Fichtner was also in the movie. He does a great job in everything I have seen him in. He is a very good actor.The soundtrack was a lot of fun. It had the classic theme tune playing towards the end of the movie and I was also waiting for The Lone Rangers classic line, ""Hi ho Silver Away!"". I loved the way Tonto reacted to this.The main thing I would say about this is it is very very unrealistic. I know it is a Disney film and it is not meant to be realistic but there were moments when I thought it was a bit too much.The effects were pretty good and it is entertaining to watch, but it is nothing classic.I will give this film 6 out of 10.""Never do that again!""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",The Lone Ranger
127,Al_The_Strange,"""There come a time, when good man must wear mask.""",9,5 July 2013,"I am not a fan of westerns, not by a long shot. What few I like are a very specific few, but most strike me as being long, dry, and boring. I certainly never gave a flying rip about The Lone Ranger. Sure, I recognize the references that have permeated in modern pop culture over the decades; we all know of the mask, the horse named Silver, the Indian dude, and the William Tell overture. For whatever reason, I never had an interest in the franchise, until now.As it stands, 2013's The Lone Ranger is easily one of the most exciting and evenly-entertaining westerns I've seen. It has big action, often venturing into realms of big-scale absurdity that's become commonplace in modern blockbusters. It has comedy; the interplay between the Ranger and Tanto is often amusing, and fills up the spaces between the action really well. Despite the comedy, the film is also pretty gritty and rough: there is a fairly high body count in this film, and it often pushes the boundaries of its PG-13 rating. Overall, it's a long feature, but I was engrossed in it the whole time.I was equally engrossed in the story. It gets a little wonky, given the unique narrative structure; this is one of those stories that's bookended by a character telling a story, with asides, flashbacks, and flashforwards at key moments. A few scenes are made a little sloppy this way, and a few pressing questions remain unanswered (how did Tanto get out of jail?). The film also gets predictable at times, and the standard western elements are dispensed liberally throughout. However, I still felt that this was a dense and well-built plot. I'm especially pleased with the characters; they are colorful and fun, but also show enough depth and emotion to make them memorable and relevant. The standard western themes of justice and civility pop up on occasion.This film uses some fantastic photography. Editing is okay, but a few scenes seem to be slapped together lazily. Acting is good: I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of Armie Hammer (who does his best to embody the look and mannerisms of the title character), Johnny Depp (who channels the same deadpan lunacy that made Jack Sparrow so fun), and everybody else. Writing is pretty decent. This production has great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is generally good, and toward the end, the William Tell overture is utilized liberally.A lot of viewers and critics don't seem to like this film, but I really don't see that much wrong with it. I feel it does to westerns what Pirates of the Caribbean did to pirate movies; it's an exciting, refreshing piece of tall-tale escapism. For a western, I am especially pleased.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",The Lone Ranger
128,Offworld_Colony,"Despite being overly-long and saturated with bonkers wonky ideas, bad editing, and a dodgy start...",7,7 February 2020,"Despite being overly-long and saturated with bonkers wonky ideas, bad editing, and a dodgy start, saddled with the politics and bad press of its budget and casting, Lone Ranger is a magnetic and watchable movie. Verbinski always manages to direct an interesting, different and handsome picture with a lot of practical sets and in-camera effects and great design with all the money on screen. It's a shame that he has no reigning in ability and his scripts are often bloated and nonsensical. But as a Western, the movie is lively and appropriately ugly. Johnny Depp is still in the phase of his career where he gives a damn about acting and his character is interesting in that he's not quite the 'noble savage' cliche and is instead a bit more nuanced. Once I knew what to expect with this movie (ie a much darker, much weirder film than any Pirates entry) then I was able to look on it more favourably as the years went on. Great cast and some solid, invigorating action set-pieces elevate a film that, while not entirely good, I still feel drawn to in some way.",The Lone Ranger

Native American spirit warrior Tonto (Johnny Depp) recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid (Armie Hammer), a man of the law, into a legend of justice- taking the audience on a runaway train of epic surprises and humorous friction as the two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption",The Lone Ranger

132,michaelarmer,Tonto meets Jack Sparrow,8,16 January 2020,"That is because the characters are very similar, not too surprising since they are performed by the same actor, with the same director. In fact almost all of this film is similar in dialogue, style and action to that series, but that is not so bad.This movie was panned by the critics and did poorly at the box office, probably because of the panning, but they are in error, as it is very good, I have not read the Lone Ranger stories, nor seen the TV series, so cannot compare, but from what I gather from the reviews it is nothing like them, why bother about that, after all it is fiction, what Disney have done is their own story using the original characters, nothing wrong in that, and it does not matter, as it is a good story and screenplay and well done.It is acted well, Johnny Depp is as usual excellent, well supported by Arnie Hammer, and the support are also very good, particularly William Fichtner who is excellent as Butch Cavendish, the very very nasty bad guy. It is well paced, with beautiful photography, good music and is well directed.My only reservations are, the far fetched 2 train chase at the end which is well over the top, and the inclusion of the music used in the TV series as the Lone Ranger theme (for some reason it does not seem to fit this film to me), but the western scenes are great.So all those critics and many reveiwers on here are talking rubbish, they are obviously sycophants to the nasties that wanted to harm the chances of this doing well.It looks like they set it up for a sequel, I dont suppose that will happen now, but I hope that they do, you never know.This is a very good movie, very entertaining, funny and exciting, ignore the critics and enjoy.",The Lone Ranger
133,diac228,"Not a masterpiece, not a disaster, but a good Western that rewards you for having patience",8,2 August 2013,"So if it looks like a Western, feels like a Western, sounds like a Western, and paces like a Western.....Then it must be a Western, right? So why is it getting so much slack for being a new-age spaghetti western? Yes The Lone Ranger is a mess. Yes it has an extremely poor script. And yes, it definitely has some jarring tonal shifts. However this movie is still entertaining, still beautifully and skillfully directed by mild-indie-at-heart Gore Verbinski, and still has some great performances that add life to a script that has no clue where it wants to go. In the midst of the bloated budget and issues lies a decent movie that will indeed keep you on your toes.There are many theories I have towards why everyone is panning this film: it could be the Johnny Depp/Disney overkill we have seen this past decade, it could be that Westerns don't have the appeal that they used to, and lastly it might be the anti-American taint that viewers might get out of the movie. Whatever the reason, The Lone Ranger might be a film that will be dissected for years to come simply because it is a breathing contradiction in so many ways.It runs as both a homage to Westerns (There are nods to John Ford and Sergio Leone classics) while also becoming an anti-Western that disassembles the stereotypes and misconceptions of the Wild West (Similar to what Unforgiven did in the 90s). The movie can be quite comical, but also deathly serious not too long before and not too long after. The movie poses as a pure Western at times, while at other times throwing some major supernatural elements for good measure. And lastly it can play like a kid's fantasy, while at the same time it throws some heavy undertones about race, class, and Manifest Destiny.The biggest reason for the quality of this origin story is the incredible direction by Gore Verbinski. Verbinski, whether you love him or hate him, can take any terrible script and can craft some magic out of it. The Mexican, At World's End, and The Lone Ranger are great examples of terrible scripts being saved because of Verbinski's attention to detail, ability to carve a great action sequence, and ability to always have a slight indie edge over the typical Hollywood director. Love or hate Johnny Depp, he still breathes layers of life and personality to the usually one-note partner Tonto. Artie Hammer, despite awkwardly being second banana despite being the main character, excels as the famed hero with the smaller dosage of material given.Just like your average blockbuster, if you can stomach some of the setbacks then you will have a good time. With the Lone Ranger it takes longer for the movie to take off, but once it does you will marvel at the cinematography, laugh at Depp and Hammer's chemistry (and hidden visual humor), and get blown away by the final action sequence that will stand as the most creative you'll see all summer.The Lone Ranger is what happens when you try to mix a Western with a blockbuster personality—it's a tough oil/water mix but it still works thanks to the creative and potentially bizarre Western-loving mind of Gore Verbinski.",The Lone Ranger
134,daniel-mannouch,"$215,000,000 worth of OK",3,24 February 2020,"The Lone Ranger is one of Disney Studio's biggest flops, part of a double whammy with John Carter from the previous year. The Lone Ranger is reported to have lost Disney around $94-$119 million and probably played a part in Disney's current ultra conservative selection process, I.E, not green-lighting any projects that are not already part of a successful franchise and as a result, making modern cinema all that more creatively impoverished. Add to that several re-writes, extreme shooting conditions, a chickenpox outbreak, Johnny Depp playing an Indian and the accidental drowning of a crew member, and you have what seems to be a cursed production leading to a underwhelming product.However, The Lone Ranger, separated from all that awfulness, as much as you can when someone dies on a film set, is an ok blockbuster really. It's highly likely that we won't see a western with a nine figure budget for a good long while, so The Lone Ranger has that going for it i guess. There is some wit, there are some fantastic action sequences, particularly within its climax. But the narrative is a mess and the film overall reeks of studio interference. The story is a migraine inducing clash of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Once Upon a Time in the West and director Gore Verbinski's own western inspired Rango. Scenes do not connect with one another. Individually they are impressive, but for $215 million they should be, otherwise accusations of embezzlement might be in order.The budget is the reason why this film is good. The stunt work, the art direction. There was money to spare to make all of that look good, but thanks to too many cooks with cold feet on Mars, the hope for a coherent film and a potential franchise got shot out the saloon window from the word go really because who in their right mind in 2013 wanted to see a Lone Ranger film.The problem is too much money. The problem is also too much competition. The film studios are rightfully scared in the 21st century with television and video games eating away at their audience share and like they always have done, they have listened to accountants when they should have been listening to creatives because late capitalism, or mercantilism as it used to be known as, as it appears there is a finite amount of options to break even, like remakes or reboots or star vehicles and of course nothing else.In conclusion, The Lone Ranger is a bad to mediocre western that just so happens to have been made with the discretionary budget of a small European nation. You might have a two hour time waster here, but for me, it's a painful reminder of what Hollywood does and why Hollywood is.... crap.",The Lone Ranger
135,p-jonsson,Lone Ranger it is NOT!,3,15 December 2013,"If this film would not have been called Lone Ranger and would not have pretended to tell the story the Lone Ranger then I would probably have considered it to be an okay movie. Maybe even a good one. However, this was supposed to be a Lone Ranger movie and that it is not! I put this movie in the same category as the very disappointing Green Hornet movie. It is a typical case of some dumbass Hollywood producer/director taking a known name and thinks he can do what the heck he wants with it. The Lone Ranger is supposed to be the only survivor of a group of rangers, a hero as well as intelligent and so is Tonto. In this movie the Lone Ranger is a bloody lawyer, he is naïve and generally a screw up. Tonto is, well, as looney as one could expect with Jonny Depp in the role.It is really said when you feel the best characters in the movie are the bad guys. I think Butch Cavendish is quite nicely portrayed by William Fichtner. Okay, the movie have its fun moments, a few laughs, some nice special effects and is not really poorly done as such. Unfortunately a lot of the time I phrases like ""what and idiot"", ""what the f"", ""this is not Lone Ranger"" and so on, went through my head while watching it.If this is the first time you have heard about the Lone Ranger, or you do not really care if the movie has anything to do with the original Lone Ranger then you probably will find this an entertaining movie.

In addition to being a prequel to the boring, tedious, and deservedly mocked TV series, the Lone Ranger gets some Robin Hood and V for Vendetta in him and Tonto. Combined with realistic video FX and outstanding sound that will keep the theme song in your head long after the film, this is far more than a ""reboot"". It's what the original should have been.There are some unfortunate Disney extravagance and story over-telling quirks that do lead to the film being a little too ambiguous and about 10 minutes longer than it needs to be. It's an experience and mostly a well-developed story, however, and deserves to be over 2 hours.No sequels, please. This is a film that's best left standing on its own. It turns a white-washed Western into a potential classic depiction of the Wild West.",The Lone Ranger
137,dvc5159,Riding the high country,7,7 July 2013,"Gore Verbinski's ""The Lone Ranger"" is a pure summer blockbuster, head to toe, filled with sensational action sequences and oddly hilarious and zany moments, though sufficient enough for character development. And yet, it feels like an old-fashioned campfire tale, told by an (unreliable) narrator as shown in the opening scene, setting things up for the main plot to come. It doesn't feel overbearing and rushed, takes its time with the pacing and characters, building momentum and excitement for the grand finale, but more on that later.Verbinski is no doubt a fan of Western films (check out his animated ""Rango"") and how he manages to take a $250 million budget and turn it into a personal love letter for the Western genre is that one-in-a- million Hollywood tale where a director uses a large amount of the studio's money to make a movie that he or she wants. Verbinski, reuniting with most of his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" writers and crew, just puts his whole into entertaining the audience as much as he can whilst not insulting them.Verbinski sure knows how and where to place the camera. The great cinematography which shows off the vistas of the American West while combined with Hans Zimmer's throbbing score which echoes that of the great Ennio Morricone's effort, makes for an odd but arresting visual and aural experience, and certainly shows Verbinski has made his film self-aware that it is made in a different time than those classic Westerns of yesteryear. The film owes more to Leone for its villains and the clean cut Golden years for its hero, obviously. In fact, the villains are pretty much the most depraved and violent in a Disney- certified film thus far.Armie Hammer, in his first lead role, provides enough charm to go along with his character's earnestness and steadfastness, but he thankfully doesn't mug for the camera as most young stars nowadays. He looks, sounds, and acts about right for the part of the Lone Ranger, and his naivety is matched only by the kookiness of his trusty companion Tonto (Johnny Depp who is top-billed). To be honest, Tonto is basically Jack Sparrow 2.0, what with Depp's usual buffoonery and oddball antics throughout, but where Sparrow doesn't seem to care about his predicament and relies on dumb luck, Tonto shows concern and purpose in his actions. I would say the chemistry between the two is good, and far from being mechanical as I expected. And the horse is always fun to watch. I would also like to point out William Fichtner for portraying such a slimy, reprehensible and yet ultimately old-fashioned-at-heart villain very well.Verbinski was wise enough to make the film stretch out to be a whopping 149 minutes, but I feel that it was sufficient for establishing the supporting characters. Lest we remind ourselves of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" with all those character moments cut short in favor of action. Oh dear.So far, so good. Within the first 2 hours it became clear to me, that Verbinski, Hammer, Depp and co. were having a blast making this movie, and that they didn't really think of the box-office or studio gossip that might hurt the movie. Or maybe, they were, and decided to use every penny of the budget as heartily as they can.Then came the climactic action sequence. I cheered.Not just because I was rooting for the Ranger and Tonto to save the day, but also because of how extremely thrilling yet entertaining the sequence was. It involves two trains, on parallel tracks, chasing each other. Any big budget studio would normally film it on a green screen, but Verbinski thought otherwise. Most of the scenes were shot for real with CGI only touching up certain scenes. The mere sight of seeing real train stunts and practical effects on the big screen again was something I thought I would never see. Verbinski's direction in this scene has a certain Spielbergian/Indy zeal to it that makes it all the more enjoyable to watch, and he takes pride in it.And all of this accompanied by a terrifically rousing extended arrangement of the William Tell Overture, giving an old-school heroic vibe, but never overwhelming the action, rather complementing it perfectly. This finale is worth the price of admission alone, although there are plenty other action sequences before this one, and lots of them involving real stuntmen rather than CGI-ed ones. These are throwbacks to those silent-era Westerns, probably ""The Great Train Robbery"" and more obviously, Buster Keaton's ""The General"", in which the train stunts have to be seen to be believed. This one, too, showing perfectly how stunts and CGI can co-exist in harmony.Bottom line, this is an exhilarating and really fun joy to watch, perfect old-fashioned escapist entertainment, lovingly crafted by a director who has an eye for camera work and thrills. This might be the first and last big-budget western you'll see in cinemas (judging from the poor box-office, unfortunately), it's a pity as Verbinski, Hammer, Depp and co. show you, in this film, how the Western was won.",The Lone Ranger

It was very entertaining and funny and the acting was great although Johnny Depp gave the best performance as Tonto Probably because no beats Johnny Depp at being weird.My only complaint about this film is the pacing. During the first act the pace is slow and progressive but in the middle it almost feels like the film is about to stand still like it's starting to drag before it picks up again close to the final act. Otherwise it didn't hurt the film too much.Overall, THE LONE RANGER is highly entertaining despite being a little slow halfway through and features great acting from all the cast members although Johnny Depp gives the better performance.",The Lone Ranger
139,rollernerd,Kemosabe,6,24 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the western action adventure movie The Lone Ranger (2013) which is based on the radio and television show about how a Texas Ranger who fought outlaws in the Old West with his Native American friend - these characters and the story is something most younger viewers would not know about. This time around from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski, the team behind the blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise comes this new revamped version of the famed masked hero fighting for injustice alongside Tonto, a Native American spirit warrior played by the ever versatile Johnny Depp.The film begins with recounting the first meeting between the masked lone ranger and Tonto to a young child who is not aware of the man of the law and the legendary tales. The film takes us through a runaway train of epic surprises and humorous banter as the two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption. The funny scenes are due to the chemistry between Depp and Armie Hammer who plays the Long Ranger. In particular the title which Tonto mentions throughout the film to the Long Ranger as ""wendigo"", or ""life out of balance"" which fits with the whole ""Koyaanisqatsi"" notion. Add this with Tonto's dead bird ontop of his head dress and his one -liners, the film does have its moments. However that's all there is with this flick just moments.Now the cinematography of this film is beautiful however what drags it down is the overdose of action and a very very long act which details the backgrounds of each character. Some scenes should have been edited or cut and made available for the directors cut. If this film was shortened by about 20 minutes this would have been a much leaner film. The film also fails on finding the right tone between its fun childish humour similar to POTC and the overdose of CGI action.The fun showdown redeems some of that. If only the film had more of that over the top comic action. Depp's performance is good but nothing new comparing it to his well-known performance of Jack Sparrow. It is mannered and modest but nothing new. The film overall loses its pacing in the second arc and I literally lost track of how many times the heroes are captured and escaped and vice versa. It kind of goes round and round like that which might appeal to younger audiences, which is the issue the producers have. Rather than focusing on providing an entertaining story they wanted to build another franchise. Disappointing but hopefully we do not hear the end of this legendary cowboy ranger - 6.1/10",The Lone Ranger

144,badajoz-1,Simply not good enough!,3,20 August 2013,"For $250M this film is simply not up to snuff. It is so derivative as to be liable to be sued for plagiarism! It is so variable in tone, comic red Indians get to be slaughtered by Gatling Gun and pantomime villains do a 'Last of the Mohicans' and cut out hearts to eat - there was a toddler in arms in the audience! Only Johnny Depp with some decent one liners makes it tolerable for an overlong 2 and a quarter hours!!!!!!!!!!!! The story is well known - Tonto (Depp redding up, which means presumably that white actors can now black up to play 'Othello!') tells the story of 'The Lone Ranger' in 1933 to a small child ('Little Big Man'). So we get a convoluted back story that goes on for ages as the Rangers are ambushed by a panto villain ('Cat Ballou') and the survivor is rescued by Tonto and given a mask. The tone goes up and down all over the place - yuck! Revenge is in order but not by the gun!! The golden spike to complete the Transcontinental Railway is driven in in Texas not Utah!!! US capitalism is mercilessly satirised as is the treatment of the Red Indian (of course, the industrialist villain is played by UK actor Tom Wilkinson) - no wonder this film was not a success in US. Locations are nice but obviously ruined by CGI imprints, eg Monument Valley and the Durango railway, while the so-called big finish is way too long and totally copied from 'Zorro' with Antonio Banderas except the motivation is silver not gold ( complete with corrupt US Cavalry captain). Really Jerry, Gore et al, could you not get a decent original script for the money????????????????????? The acting is OK, but Arnie Hammer is straight out of the Brendan Frazer School of Acting - I'd sue, if I were you, Brendan! The script is a real cheat and disgrace, apart from a couple of jokes (Clement and Le Frenais possibly?), while the overblown direction is appalling. One minute Verbinski is trying to be John Ford ( cue religious singing, long widescapes of Monument Valley, and a brother in love with his brother's wife - oh dear, Mr Ford , you did not deserve such self-serving boring tribute/plagiarism), and the next, a misfiring comic romp.

Pirates also had a great (British) ensemble cast, here we have the Depp-Hammer duo, but Hammer can't really match Depp and maybe it was too soon for him. He played some minor roles left and right, but who remembered that? The film is generally very entertaining but at 150 mins it's too long, 20 mins less could have made it more streamlined. So enjoy it coz this was the first and at the same time the last one there will ever be in the series.",The Lone Ranger
146,Aly200,A bold and creative misfire,5,2 August 2018,"When it was announced that the Mouse House would adapt this classic radio drama, it was a strange but possibly compelling project. After all, Armie Hammer from ""The Social Network"" was tapped for the title role and Johnny Depp would costar alongside him with Gore Verbinski in the director's chair. However when production issues becoming making the headlines, this was a warning sign of potential failure but we continued to hold out hope till the release. Ultimately the skeptics weren't entirely wrong to be worried as the film became a massive bomb following the train wreck known as ""John Carter"". The story is definitely an origin story about how John Reid became the title hero. I won't spoil the main plot as the radio drama delivers a vastly superior tale that is the actual origin and not what Disney's film shows. While the filmmakers do somewhat actually show how John and Tonto meet later in the film's first act, the overall execution is sloppy beyond measure to faithful devotees of the TV series or radio drama.
 
In the lead role of the Lone Ranger, Armie Hammer's compelling talent from his earlier success in David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" is severely thrown to the wayside. I doubt this is the actor's fault completely because Hammer is one of the finest actors of the new millennium and is more the fault of the writers. The Ranger's legendary bravery is woefully left in the dirt and replaced with ridiculous scenarios that paint him as hapless or needing to rescued unlike his previous incarnates who held their own. While nailing the action sequences and attempting to have chemistry with Depp, the delivery of lines and charm are sorely wasted and is more laughable than engaging.Creating controversy for the film was the decision to cast Johnny Depp as the Native American sidekick, Tonto. The Oscar nominee has claimed he might have Cherokee ancestry, but whether its true or not there is an issue with casting a Caucasian in non-white roles. From Scarlett Johannsson in ""Ghost in the Shell"" from 2017 to early examples like Mickey Rooney in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's (playing an Asian man)"" to blackface, this is a casting notice that needs to be addressed in Hollywood. While Depp tries to be sensitive, the portrayal by the eccentric actor comes across as cringe-worthy and horribly embarrassing. The writers, like writing the title character, seems to forget the true origins of Tonto from the original programs. As already mentioned, the chemistry between Armie Hammer and Depp is virtually absent unlike Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheel in the original TV show. It's also clear that Disney decided to make it more of the ""Johnny Depp movie with the Winklevi twins guy"" which misses who the movie should actually be about.The film's sole highlights would have to be its creepy villain played by character actor William Fichtner, the action sequences (obvious where most of the budget went aside from Johnny Depp's salary), stunt work (Armie Hammer learned to ride a horse while shooting a gun on a moving train which is pretty impressive) and the driving score by Oscar winning composer Han Zimmer which includes a great revamp of the original radio and TV show theme (the final movement from the ""William Tell Overture""). If only the rest of the film could've been on the same level.",The Lone Ranger
147,nesfilmreviews,Too much that goes on far too long.,4,3 July 2013,"""The Lone Ranger"" suffers from the same problems as the ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" franchise. The film has an encouraging start, but ends as an overblown mess that goes on far too long with elaborate set pieces that ultimately feel meaningless and without purpose. The film reunites the original ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski, with its main star Johnny Depp, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a price tag hovering around the $250 million dollar mark.The year is 1869 and the first transcontinental railroad is nearing completion. As Texas-born attorney John Reid (Armie Hammer) travels home from college, his train is attacked by a band of outlaws who have come to break their cannibalistic leader Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) out of custody. John joins his brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and the rest of the Texas Rangers to track him down, only to be ambushed by Cavendish in the desert to be slaughtered like cattle. Left for dead, John is nursed back to life by a Comanche Indian named Tonto (Depp) – whose life he saved earlier on the train – at the behest of a white spirit horse. Both men want to bring Cavendish to justice for their own reasons, so they decide to team up, with John donning a mask to hide his identity. But on their quest to take down Cavendish and his men, the pair uncovers a larger plot involving railroad tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) that could spell trouble for the native tribes.The erratic nature of the storytelling really hurts the overall result, especially when the film already feels cluttered and overblown. While the movie has some enjoyable, entertaining moments, the second act of the film loses steam, feeling lifeless and dull when it to takes itself far too seriously. Additionally confusing is the handful of dark and violent moments that are present in what is supposed to be a summer blockbuster family-friendly movie. Another significant issue is the runtime, which clocks in at 149 minutes, which feels much longer than that. A mixed bag of conflicting films all in one, ""The Lone Ranger"" is occasionally entertaining, yet ultimately disappointing. Deviating between violence, gruesome villains, and silly humor, the film never quite figures out what it wants to be and when to call it quits.",The Lone Ranger
148,masercot,Not as Bad as they Say,7,18 August 2014,"I turned this movie on, last night, expecting to turn it off pretty quickly; however, it never got bad. It never got brilliant, either.Telling the story of the Lone Ranger through an elderly Tonto seemed inspired... by Little Big Man. Depp mostly mugs through his performance of Tonto; but, changing his character to what is essentially a shaman type character made his partnership with the Lone Ranger more understandable.The action is pretty good and, excluding the big train chase at the end, didn't seem excessive in the special effects department.Definitely a good evening's entertainment... worth a watch, but not two.

Several dead animals and a tragically maimed woman are not my vision of a fun movie, And still I rated it 9 out of ten, and this is why: the movie, while not being a funny story, tells an important story. It's good to see Hollywood tackle their own history. After obsessively and incessantly bashing Germany for the Nazis killing and exploiting Jews, it is much more appropriate and welcome and right that Hollywood now and then sees/shows that the US did nothing else than the Nazis by exploiting/defrauding/killing the native Americans (the US is build on the blood of the native inhabitants, on a land stolen from others) and later on the Africans. I wouldn't stress this so much, if the US would stop pointing fingers at others all the time instead of looking at their own mistakes - at least once in a while. Everybody tackle their own responsibilities. Important stuff, well told, just not a fun movie - in no respect.",The Lone Ranger
150,quaseprovisorio,"it's actually a good, funny and smart blockbuster!",7,10 February 2016,"The Lone Ranger. Oh no, Johnny Depp again doing some weirdo in overacting. Now about a genre not in his best days (nor the pirates were actually), with a hero lots of people outside US only recognize with the music, with budget and production problems....and for my surprise i enjoyed it.I think it came in a time where we we're all tired of depp's weirdness. So people were less curious to see it. Speaking the truth, depp is way more contained on this one. Not much dialoge, some physical humor yes, but nothing too over the top. Armie hammer is the main character, and actually i liked him: a man that wants justice to be served, but understands in his journey that man care way less than him, about following the rules. This is the story of a man that gets disenchanted with the system as the movie goes.The movie talks about the illusion of justice, the Indian slaughter, lots of times not for ""progress"" but money - with the excuse of progress-, how in a way capitalism is subverted because it follows the rules of the ones that have the money and the power. It's actually more layer developed than most blockbusters usually are. mostly one that cost A TON of money.True, it could have been shorter, the rhythm is not very good here and there, but it has some really good action sequences, i liked all the performances, main and supporting roles, it's not the most balanced ride, but it works! it's really underrated i would say. I'm gonna guess: it's gonna be one of these movies, 10 years from now, people will write tons of things on why it failed. I do think we have some cult following around here. I would love a (lower lower lower) budget sequel on it. Shame it probably would never happen.forger what you heard about this, go and check it. You might be pretty surprised!",The Lone Ranger
151,rgblakey,Tonto and the Lone Ranger ride again,5,2 July 2013,"For years the Lone Ranger has been a main stay in popular culture even when the western slowly seemed to phase off the radar. Beyond the radio dramas and popular TV series there was little else for fans to enjoy until the dismal 1981s The Legend of The Lone Ranger that did so bad that it seemed he would never ride onto the big screen again, until now. When the announcement came of Disney's The Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp attached the speculation started flying on how it would work, but now the time has some and the Lone Ranger is riding again, but can he stay on the horse? The Lone Ranger follows Tonto, an American Indian spirit warrior, as he recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice and how these two unlikely heroes learned to work together and fight against greed and corruption. First it needs to be clear that this is more of a reimagining of the Lone Ranger mythology and seemingly tries to tell the story more from Tonto's point of view. There are a lot of things here that are both good and bad depending on what you expect from this movie. The hardcore Lone Ranger fans will be the first to rip it apart likely not liking the changes or the more light hearted sometimes comedic approach to the film. This is pretty much Pirates of the Caribbean in the west, which isn't always a bad thing, but not quite the Lone Ranger movie everyone has been waiting for. With that being said, the movie is still a lot of fun on a lot of levels. The first half of the film tells the legend of the Ranger with some alterations here and there on both characters and is pretty interesting. There is a point in the middle where the film slows down a bit as you eagerly await that moment to finally get the Ranger in action. The cast do a fine job with Hammer carrying the Lone Ranger decent enough, but never really gets to deliver that hardcore hero aspect until the end. Depp is clearly channeling his Jack Sparrow a bit for this more crazed version of Tonto, but does a decent job carrying the movie. The real treat of them all comes with the always awesome William Fitchner's villain who is just the ultimate western badass and great to watch. The film sports tons of over the top action that isn't always all that believable but is well executed and a lot of fun.There is an entire aspect of the film that could have been ditched involving Tonto telling the legend to a small boy that is meant to move the film along, but is the weakest aspect of the whole film. They could have taken that out and still delivered the exact same film. While this isn't the Lone Ranger fans have been wanting, it is one that is clearly meant to try and please everyone and get some interest in the western genre, because let's be honest they aren't tearing up the box office these days. Whatever your thoughts all will be forgotten when the William Tell Overture kicks on and the Lone Ranger rides taking those old school fans back to their childhood making it all worth it. It's far from perfect but still some fun and it could always be worse, anyone remember Wild, Wild, West?",The Lone Ranger
152,CleveMan66,"""The Lone Ranger"" offers an unwelcomed modern version of classic characters.",4,4 February 2015,"Origin stories of classic characters are very popular right now and ""The Lone Ranger"" is just the latest major motion picture to follow that trend. But with this film, you get two origin stories for the price of one. ""The Lone Ranger"" is as much an origin story of Tonto as of the title character himself.The movie follows the story of the man behind the mask as he transitions from naïve, clean-cut lawman to a kind of Robin Hood of the old West. Armie Hammer makes a fine modern version of the Lone Ranger. Sadly, the same cannot be said for Johnny Depp's version of Tonto. In this film, Tonto becomes more than just the Lone Ranger's faithful Indian friend. He has pride, smarts, and a past - one that portrays him as an outcast, teetering on the edge of sanity. Creating an eccentric character worked wonderfully well when Johnny Depp turned Captain Jack Sparrow into a household name, but doesn't work nearly as well when he fiddles with a character with a history in recent American culture and who carries with him certain expectations from the audience. Updating classic characters is all well and good, as long as you maintain the spirit of that character. That's the reason audiences turn out to see the movie in the first place. If you want to create a brand new character, just don't pretend that it's the same character fans have grown to know and love. This is the mistake that Johnny Depp makes in his portrayal of Tonto - a slightly less manic (but equally loopy) Jack Sparrow with war paint, a deeper voice and speaking in broken English. It just didn't work for me.Unfortunately, I have similar criticisms of the film as a whole. While the story is engaging enough, the modern take is too different from the spirit of the original (the same mistake ""Man of Steel"" makes with Superman) and I only really enjoyed a 10-minute section late in the movie which gave me just enough of the spirit of the original story to make me fully appreciate what I was missing. If the entire film had been more like the climactic scene (and Johnny Depp had used his considerable talents to play Tonto with the gravitas that he is fully capable of), I would have enjoyed this movie much more than I did. As it stands, the most I can muster for ""The Lone Ranger"" is a C+. And if you do decide to see the movie, do yourself a favor and do not stay until the end of the closing credits. As you see the credits roll and you see the final scene developing, know that it will not change. You can leave the theater at that point and avoid wasting another five minutes of your life.",The Lone Ranger
153,JaydoDre,Fun but a bit stupid and messy,6,21 April 2014,"Do you remember, back when you were in school, your language teacher taught you that if you can remove a part of the text you are writing, and nothing is lost contextually, then you should keep that part of the text removed? Yeah, someone forgot to proofread this otherwise promising movie.Let's start with the elephant standing in the corner over there, the one with its face painted. If you have a problem that the Indian Tonto is portrayed ridiculously by a white dude then you would of course not watch this movie or read this review, for you know from the trailer or the posters of the movie that this is the case and if you then still proceed to watch the movie then you are not very intelligent or nice for complaining about it.Now, for those who do not have their head stuck in their politically correct rear ends, the film is really not as bad as the critics made it out to be. For one, the cinematography and music in this film are great. The desaturated sun rays piercing through the cracks in the wood, the dust and the texture of the withered faces make for great Western atmosphere. Nothing wrong with the camera work either.There IS some really good acting in this movie. William Fitchner makes for a scary bad guy and James Badge is really good as the Lone Ranger's brother. Quite frankly if they took the two main characters, Lone Ranger and Tonto, out of this movie then it would have been much better, because if there is one character who is not very interesting it is the Lone Ranger himself, and if there is one character who is too ridiculous and ultimately flopped, it is Tonto.I do not think it is the actors' fault. For the Lone Ranger, nothing of what he is given to say grants him any depth of character, besides his love of justice. He is supposed to be a morally straight gentleman, but this also makes him really bland. The fact that he doesn't speak as much as the other characters only makes that blandness worse. As for Tonto, Depp's delivery is odd. Sometimes it works and sometimes he is like a forced parody of himself. It is as if Tonto was a real guy and Depp was making fun of that person for a comedy sketch. The slapstick he does goes too far. It crosses the line from stupid fun to just stupid. But someone had to write and direct the stupid, so I would blame them for it and not the actors.There is however a certain Helena Carter. I don't like her character. I don't really get why she plays the same weird character in every movie. So I feel like anything else I say about her performance here will be tainted by my bias about the actress so I will leave it at that.The critics have spilled their criticism all over this film because it is not intelligent or original enough. It's Pirates of the Caribbean in the Wild West. Now, they are mostly right. There are scenes and characters that appear to have been taken straight out of the Pirates of the Caribbean. And at its heart, The Lone Ranger is about people doing slapstick comedy. However, I do not see a problem with that concept, unless you are so stuck up that you forgot what fun is. The problem is not with the concept but with the execution of that concept.While the slapstick in the Pirates of the Caribbean was smart, funny and reserved, in the Lone Ranger they botched it up. The silliness goes over the top, crossing the line from silly to stupid over and over again. It often feels like a Charlie Chaplin filmcrossed with Looney Toonson steroids. The action goes completely off the rails towards the end. The laws of physics need not apply.The mood is also all over the place. It goes from really serious and gruesome moments to silly jokes and back to gruesome again. Now look, I like me some dark comedy but in this case it feels more like 2 or 3 different movies stuffed into one; like 3 different people worked separately on the script and then 3 different people directed the film.Botched humor aside, I think the anger about this movie is not about it being a bad film, but rather about it not being what it could or should have been. And because certain actors and the cinematography are so good, it makes the stupid stand out so much more by contrast.But at the end of the day, The Lone Ranger is most certainly not an abomination; it is not the end of the world. It is just a silly movie with its fair share of stupid moments and misfired jokes. You can do much worse.",The Lone Ranger
154,michael_the_nermal,Much Darker Than I'd Expect From a Movie From the Mouse,5,7 July 2013,"Warning! Major plot and thematic spoilers ahead!To start, Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski already made a wonderful and highly entertaining Western movie: ""Rango."" ""Rango"" was a clever, creative and whimsical spoof of the Western genre that also payed homage to the genre as a whole and addressed in a not-so-subtle fashion historical and present-day problems in the American West. In contrast, ""The Lone Ranger"" is an attempt to recreate the overdone CGI, fantastic action and quirky comedy of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise in a Western setting. The result is ultimately unsatisfactory.My main problem with ""The Lone Ranger"" is the amount of violence and swearing in what has been marketed ostensibly as a family movie distributed by the Walt Disney Company. If this film were marketed towards an older audience (those 13 and up) under the Touchstone label, perhaps I wouldn't be making this complaint. The violence was especially gruesome (though not extraordinarily graphic), and the language inappropriate for an audience of children. I am not exaggerating when I say that the level of violence is only a few steps below the grisly carnage one could see on ""Game of Thrones"" on a Sunday night. People have criticized ""Game of Thrones"" for its graphic violence (particularly that of the third season; I'll say no more on that), yet a Disney film featuring an army of Indians getting mowed down by machine gun fire and a Texas Ranger getting his chest stabbed by a Bowie knife (with the killer raising a bloody palm after committing the foul deed) hardly raises a peep from critics or the news media. This film also features a scene taking place in a gaudy brothel, wherein a madam shoots at a would-be John for getting a little too frisky with one of the prostitutes. To the film's credit, prostitutes, brothels, and madams are not identified as such, but older viewers--even those not familiar with the Western genre--will know exactly what's being shown. Parents should be strongly cautioned if they consider taking any children under 13 to watch this movie.The content is especially troubling given the subjects: the iconic radio and TV characters of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. These iconic heroes were, since their inception over eighty years ago, targeted towards an audience of children. Moreover, the Lone Ranger and Tonto traditionally represented traditional values of honesty, justice and virtue, all within *the official confines of the recognized law and order;* in other words, the Lone Ranger was never an antihero or cynical vigilante, but always tried to uphold the law and obey the officially recognized authorities. In a post-1960's society, the Lone Ranger's moral certainty and respect for official law and order seems old-fashioned and archaic. Today's action movies, and the heroes portrayed in them, need a dose of cynicism and doubt with regards to ""official"" law and order in order to be marketable to a more jaded 21st-century audience; in this film, the Lone Ranger has an important moment where he questions the way the world works after realizing that officialdom is corrupt and in league with the ""bad guys,"" and wrestles with the idea that *killing* your enemies is acceptable if it is done for the greater good. These themes are awfully dark for a Disney film targeted towards a young audience; hell, they're dark even for a show as morally ambiguous and grim as ""Game of Thrones!"" These themes, moreover, go *against* the typically straight-laced morality of the old ""Lone Ranger"" TV show. The Western genre is not so much spoofed, as it was in ""Rango,"" so much as exaggerated to a silly degree and infused with prolonged action and spectacular special effects typical of the ""Pirates"" films. Like ""Pirates,"" the film's running time is overly bloated, but the film's climactic action scenes are so fantastical as to be entertaining. The flashy action scenes are this film's saving grace--that, and the equine actor who played Silver. Like many other posters, I thought the horse was exceptionally well- trained and was more entertaining and funny than the human actors. Silver was amusing, intelligent, and a delight to watch on the screen. The Western stock characters and plot line are blatantly predictable to anyone who's familiar with the Western genre: we have the badman (""black hat""), good guy (literally, he wears a ""white hat""), the feisty brothel madam, the corrupt politician/railroad baron, and the lascivious old drunkard with a heart of gold. Actual history (the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, the discovery of silver in the mountains, and, more disrespectfully, the dispossession of the American Indians) is transformed into fantasy. I'd hope Disney would tread carefully when showing conflict between American Indians and the whites; sadly, they are not careful when showing such a controversial and sensitive issue, and reduces such a crucial event in human history into a plot device involving Tonto and the corrupt politician. Yes, the white railroad man is shown as the villain and the Indians are the good guys, but I thought Disney's handling of white-Indian conflict was sloppy at best, disrespectful at worst.In short, ""The Lone Ranger"" is a mess of a movie. It's too violent and cynical to be a good family film, and too silly and simpleminded to be a film for grown-ups. The Western genre is not really portrayed well here, either as parody or homage. I recommend you watch ""Rango"" instead, and then can say safely that Verbinsky and Depp *did* make a good Western film.",The Lone Ranger

157,CMTiago,Enjoyable but too long,6,10 February 2014,"Last year part of me didn't find it surprising that this movie failed at the box office having opened in the same of weekend of the very strong Despicable Me 2. That combined with some poor reviews toned down my expectations for this which were medium at that time. Out of nowhere it scored two Oscar nominations which forced me to watch it sooner than I thought I would. With a running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, I thought for sure that this was going to be a tough viewing and therefore I tried to make the most of it. Thorughout the film there were some exciting parts but overall there were some very dull moments which kind kills your enthusiasm a bit. In the end though the filmmakers managed to make up for this with an entertaining final showdown. As far as performances go Johnny Depp works fine with is given to him. Tonto is a silly character and the necessary sidekick to our hero, who is still taking is first steps into becoming The Lone Ranger. Having seen Armie Hammer in The Social Network I wasn't quite sure he would fill the leading man shoes well. After the movie I felt it was done well enough for the movie. All other cast members do their part well and with all other aspects of the movie make for an enjoyable experience. My only real problem was the running time which stretched unnecessarily. A better job from editing and I might have enjoyed more. If there is a sequel I hope they make a better job, although I am not saying this one was bad, it just means that it needs a little improvement.Rating 6,5/10",The Lone Ranger
158,C22Man,This is the film that everybody hated?!?,9,19 January 2016,"When The Lone Ranger was first released the critics absolutely hated it. They said it was inconsistent, strange, not much fun and that Johnny Depp had no right to be playing a Native American. In response to that I simply have to question what people were expecting from this film. It is clearly made to be an offbeat adventure with plenty of comedy and big action set pieces. I don't think it was ever meant to be anything more than that, just some good escapist fun, yet people love to give it a hard time when it did what it set out to excellently. Yes it is tonally all over the place and it does get very weird at times, but in a way that adds to this bizarre world that the film creates and the things it gets right are truly outstanding.The story of the Lone Ranger is fairly straight-forward, told in flashbacks by Native Indian Tonto. Law man John Reid is ambushed and left for dead by outlaw Butch Cavendish, but is rescued by Tonto at the insistence of a spirit animal as both set off to bring Cavendish to justice for very different reasons and uncover a wider conspiracy. The story is pretty simple on the surface and isn't that difficult to follow, it just have Reid and Tonto travelling to various locations and the escapades they get up to. There is a larger story at working involving the railroad that is quite predictable, but the focus is kept where it should be and that is on the main characters. They are an odd couple yet the film does flesh them out so that you care about their predicament and allows for their partnership to grow during the film in a way that is surprisingly naturalistic.On to the two leads, people really disliked Johnny Depp here and said he was just doing Jack Sparrow as an Indian. In a way that is true as he does do a lot of exaggerated expression and carries a nonchalant approach, but he is still very enjoyable. His Tonto is an oddball and difficult to follow at times, but that does add to his mystery and he does have a solid backstory. Depp is also excellent with the physical comedy here, he can make you laugh by his body movement or facial expressions alone. Armie Hammer puts in an accomplished performance as our title hero. He's not as enigmatic as Tonto, but he is a likable lead and easy to root for which is just what you want. Hammer not only looks the part, but handles the serious scenes with subtlety and the comedy with a cool wit. The action sequences are amongst the film's most impressive features. It is very stylised most of the time and can verge on the unbelievable, but it is always engrossing and shot superbly well with most of it involving trains. The opening sequence is exciting and is a great introduction to our main characters, though the climax is where it really shines. It is pretty much one big chase involving two trains and it is fantastic, featuring plenty of intense moments and old- fashioned action that works perfectly. With all that said the violence can be quite brutal and the film doesn't shy away from blood or gore. The villain Cavendish is a little too bland. His is a believable threat and William Fichtner makes him menacing, but he just doesn't get much to do or have much character. Ruth Wilson did impress as Reid's old love and gave likability to what could have been a forgettable love interest. Both Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter are solid as ever in their supporting roles.As a result of the odd pairing the film is a lot funnier than you'd initially expect. Both slapstick and verbal humour are used to full effect, most of it in the interactions between our two heroes as a result of their misadventures or conflicting views, and there are also plenty of surreal moments such as the white horse appearing in high places out of nowhere. This might put some people off, but for me the comedic and stranger aspects added to this styled Wild West that the film has crafted. It is shot fantastically too as Verbinski has a real eye for images that can be both striking and disturbing, while the scenery is particularly beautiful here and there is a very authentic feel of the West present. Hans Zimmer adds another great score to his collection, one that has a smart balance of being both rousing and action orientated.For me The Lone Ranger is an unfairly shunned film. For some reason people were expecting this to be a big epic and cared more about its budget than the actual content, forgetting to view it as the light- hearted adventure romp that it was intended to be. It does have tonal issues and is maybe a touch too long, but they don't detract from its glowing positives. As I've said I think the strange undertones give the film personality, the action is spectacular, there's a wide variety of comedy and the two leads are good fun. People have noted that it is like Pirates of the Caribbean as a Western which isn't far off. It takes a straight-forward premise and makes it feel big whilst adding plenty of comedy and action. Effectively, if you want some old-fashioned escapist adventure then I can't think of many films more suited for it than this.",The Lone Ranger
159,flapdoodle64,Whipping Boy for the Summer Movie Critics,8,5 September 2013,"The world needed a Lone Ranger movie, and while this one is not perfect, it's a lot better than many so-called 'summer blockbusters' of 2013.It would be nearly impossible, in our post-modern, ironic, cynical world, to do the Lone Ranger with the same earnestness as the classic Clayton Moore/Jay Silverheels version. Rather than try to do something nearly impossible, the director of this film elected to give us two earnest characters, who inhabit an Old West that, because it contains the irony and cynicism usually whitewashed from our history books, feels post-modern. I enjoyed both Armie Hammer's and Johnny Depp's respective performances in this film, and I was amenable to the Masked Man and Tonto being rebooted in a somewhat Quixotic vein. (I am still troubled, however, that the producers did not find a real Commanche or least First Nations actor to play Tonto, however.) I especially appreciate this film's deconstruction of US mythology, especially the now-metastatic Cult of the Military. This is an action-comedy with wonderful western scenery, interesting characters, good acting, that challenges one's political assumptions. There are plenty of excellent action sequences, and of course, the climactic sequence does play the William Tell Overture in the background. There are also some moments of genuine heart and soul. If you like the Lone Ranger, there is no substitute for watching the Masked Man and Tonto in action while this music plays in the background. Any movie featuring Batman or 007 is guaranteed to sell a certain number of tickets based on name recognition alone. But the Lone Ranger hasn't had that kind of name recognition since at least the 1960's...why Disney decided to spend astronomical sums on a mostly forgotten action hero franchise is a mystery, but they did it 2 years ago with John Carter, so there you go. The point is, if Disney had set a reasonable budget for this film, a lot of things would have been different. Why critics panned this film is an interesting question. It may be that they sensed that TLR would flop, for the reasons cited in the previous paragraph, so they just decided to make this film a whipping boy for the excesses of summer movie goers. It's a fact that in this day of media hyper-consolidation and uber-budget summer blockbusters, critics who want to keep their jobs are routinely pressured into giving favorable reviews of certain movies...emotionally, they need to take out their anger somewhere, and in 2013, The Lone Ranger was their target. It may even be that the US govt., not liking the way its military is portrayed here, exerted pressure. (The US govt. approved the script for this year's Superman movie, and helped promote the film). But the point is, the critics were wrong. This is a very fine action/escapist film. It's not the perfect Lone Ranger and Tonto...no one will ever replace Moore and Silverheels...but this is the only Lone Ranger we've got, and it was good enough for me.",The Lone Ranger
160,toqtaqiya2,Though formulaic The Lone Ranger is still a thrilling Western.,5,6 September 2013,"After the Pirates Of The Caribbean film series director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer decided to bring a different genre movie to the big screen. The Lone Ranger is a big budget action-packed Western with a cast of talented actors, including a number of Brits. Johnny Depp's Tonto is another original comedic creation by the actor. Depp is often funny in the role and Tonto is easily the most memorable character in the film. Armie Hammer plays Tonto's partner John Reid, a masked vigilante who seeks the perpetrators responsible for his brother's death. Hammer is fine in the role but I found his interpretation to be somewhat stiff. It's not entirely his fault because the screenplay by Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is clearly weak sometimes. This hurts the film too because it takes a long time to reveal the back story of the characters. William Fichtner, playing the ruthless and cannibalistic outlaw Butch Cavendish, is excellent as one of the villains in the film. Tom Wilkinson as Latham Cole and Ruth Wilson as Rebecca Reid also deliver good performances. Hans Zimmer composed a memorable score. I like Zimmer's atmospheric, eerie score for The Dark Knight Rises (2012) very much. He composed a rousing score for Man Of Steel (2013), and he again aids The Lone Ranger with a set of music themes that may compel some viewers to get the soundtrack. In the action department Verbinski delivers a number of enjoyable, cartoonish action sequences. They're lengthy but they're something that viewers have never seen before. I found The Lone Ranger to be an entertaining blockbuster. One can say that it lacks originality, that it's ponderously plotted, and that it's made according to the Pirates Of The Caribbean formula. Still, there are enjoyable bits throughout the film. More time should have been spent on developing the characters though. Like John Carter (2012) before it The Lone Ranger is another Walt Disney Studios release that underperformed at the box office. This may be because it's a high-concept Western or because, as Armie Hammer said, many critics unjustly bashed it. The film earned $239 million on a budget of $225 million. In the end, however, The Lone Ranger is an adventure comedy that's well worth seeing. I recommend it.",The Lone Ranger
161,Genti23,Amazing movie forget what the critics are saying !,10,18 July 2014,"This movie is really good Johnny Depp as always kills it what an amazing actor he is also Armie Hammer is pretty good actually and the visual effects,make-up and hairstyle are beyond prefect. The action sequences are also so awesome that makes you want more and more this is in fact one of the best movies of 2013 I really don't see how people can dislike this. The 6.6 rating here is absurd this should have been at least 7.5 but for me at least is definitely a 10.I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it go and see it , if you have seen it go and re-see it.And even though I am not a fan of western movies this is just that good that made me wanna start seeing western in a different eye ! 10/10 no doubt!",The Lone Ranger
162,JPfanatic93,It's pretty average but it didn't deserve to flop that hard,6,23 September 2013,"Big budget remake of the classic radio play and television series appropriates the success formula formerly applied to the Pirates of the Caribbean films, which is not surprising considering the same people and studio that made those swashbucklers are behind this project. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer for Disney and directed by Gore Verbinski, The Lone Ranger once again makes ample use of Johnny Depp's uncanny talent for playing weird, seemingly mentally unbalanced outcasts, considered a main audience draw for which Depp as usual received top billing, even though he does not play the titular character (in that regard it's Alice in Wonderland all over again). This time Depp assumes the mantle of the Lone Ranger's iconic Indian sidekick, Tonto, who recalls his adventures with the movie's actual hero at extreme old age, stuck in a sideshow tour as a noble savage. This framing of a tale within a tale is rather annoying as the movie tends to swivel from one version of Tonto to the other at moments where such distraction is not at all warranted and takes the pace out of the piece. Armie Hammer (The Social Network) plays John Reid, an overly morally righteous lawyer who must cope with the fact that the rules of law simply don't apply in the Wild West, especially when those in power make their own law. As a result, his valiant brother is killed and he himself is left for dead, until Tonto ""resurrects"" him and helps him get in shape as a masked Ranger who fights for justice and protects the weak from those who would corrupt the law for their own nefarious purposes. Enter an unscrupulous railroad tycoon and his sinister henchman with a taste for excessive violence (the ever eerie William Fichtner), who mean to instigate a war with the Indians in order to move in on their territory that contains huge silver deposits. Reid and Tonto, who is also an outcast amongst his own tribe for being a supposed nutcase, must find a way to expose the plot as well as save Reid's sweet sister-in-law and her young son.This results in the usual action driven plot, moving from setpiece to setpiece through all the old Western locales, including a whorehouse run by Helena Bonham Carter (equipped with an ivory faux leg of large calibre), Native American teepee villages and the indispensable classic Fordian landscapes of canyons and unusual rock formations no Western ought to do without. Except from the climactic train chase, which admittedly is one of the finest and funniest ever put on film, most action scenes cannot escape a sense of staleness. Depp does his usual thing on autopilot, playing Tonto as a psychologically ambiguous character that gets into trouble regularly but always manages to pull himself out, more with luck than through his wits as he stumbles into one Keaton-esque gag after the other, while the naive but handsome Reid follows the predictable path from idealistic city boy to genuine Western hero. As was the case with the Pirates movies, there is a distinct supernatural flavor to the story which both feels confusing and often out of place, though adding to Tonto's mystique but also to his establishment as a totally silly character. And what's the deal with having Fichtner cut out and consume the hearts of his adversaries while he's clearly a stupendously terrifying character already? Despite Depp's presence, The Lone Ranger couldn't connect with American audiences and ended up a domestic flop, though at the moment of writing it's too early to tell whether the same is true from an international perspective. For this failure producers and actors, in an odd moment of anger made public, blamed the critics who according to them panned the movie for its numerous production troubles, but that's a wholly nonsensical notion since due to the ever growing advent of opinionated online writing about movies critics just aren't heeded to as they once used to be: also, many movies critics regard as bad continue to do well regardless (Transformers, Scary Movie, etc.). Apparently the people that made this movie just didn't see both the lack of creative quality in their own project – though it's not as bad as some would have you believe, it's definitely not a grand and memorable blockbuster flick either – and the overuse of Disney's formulaic line of thinking that already started to backfire on the Pirates movies. Incidentally, those that follow the current TV-series Hell on Wheels, that largely delves into the same historic and thematic material as this film, will find little in here that that show didn't do before (and better). Except for the train chase of course.",The Lone Ranger
163,FilmMuscle,Pirates of the Caribbean in the West!,7,22 July 2013,"Coming off of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and the delightful Rango, Gore Verbinski has chosen the high path by starting on a new story instead of milking his successful franchise dry (leave it to Rob Marshall to ruin). Anyways, I was quite skeptical about The Lone Ranger, judging from the trailers. It looked rather bizarre and none too appealing the way a summer movie usually should be. Well, entering with fairly low expectations, I left thoroughly surprised. You have Johnny Depp playing a Native American named Tonto and Armie Hammer playing an adventurous lawyer named John Reid, and as they come to a confrontation, their journey begins. Again, I'd rather leave out the plot details and all that jazz in my reviews because I hate having to present readers with the story of the film. First of all, I'm not good at it, and second of all, it's so pointless, considering that there are probably people like me who want to experience films without too much information. Going forward, the film is actually pretty similar to the PotC movies in that both of their main characters proceed on a lengthy, action-packed adventure throughout various lands for basically the entire film. In addition, you have the exact same humor, which is again provided by Johnny Depp, and this is where I unfortunately name one of my major gripes with the movie. It's that Johnny Depp plays an incredibly similar character to Jack Sparrow; the only difference being is that Tonto is a Native American, not a swash-buckling pirate. They provide the same amount of comic relief throughout their respective films, and I was not in the least bit convinced of Johnny Depp as a ""fighting-for-his-land"" Native American. He never brings that seriousness to his character even though the film begs for it as it primarily deals with the theme of the white men taking the land of America from its original inhabitants. Instead of aggressively plotting against the villainous characters of the film to proclaim his land that's unjustly stolen, he takes his time with goofiness and outlandishness. Other than that, the film itself is actually enjoyable with the humor occasionally delivering and the adventure being wholly entertaining from start to finish. Now, this is where the audiences have to expect what they're really getting from the film, meaning if you view it with the right expectations, it'll be a blast. The pacing is surprisingly decent for an approximately two-and-a-half-hour movie with little to no scenes being dragged out or completely vapid. There are a few twists and turns along the way, and as the story progresses, you buy into the chemistry between Tonto and John Reid. The development of their relationship feels interesting as they're not the typical giddy best friends nor do you ever feel like they particularly like one another, which makes the film that much more captivating- how will they be able to finally reach their goal when they're constantly fighting and arguing with each other? Then comes the set design which is utterly believable, placing you into the perilous West where outlaws dueling it out left and right. To put it simply, everything feels in place in terms of the look. Noticeably, critics have been discussing the numerous tone shifts throughout the movie, and I found one tragic action scene later in the film a little out of place as the rest of the film felt more lighthearted than anything, but I didn't exactly see anything that bothered me elsewhere. In the end, The Lone Ranger has its fair share of flaws but not nearly as many as critics are whining about. If you're looking for a popcorn flick, The Lone Ranger will be one of the few movies at the local theater that can satisfy you in that department. Otherwise, there's nothing else to it, and as most blockbusters in recent years, there's no knowing if this film will be remembered in a couple of years down the road, but in the meantime- if you've got the money- why not? If you don't, save it for something more memorable and unique, which means ""save it for the fall!""",The Lone Ranger
164,tinovalkki,Wild Wild Mess,3,4 July 2013,"There seems to be everything you need for a good adventure movie in Lone Ranger. Beautiful scenery, great action scenes, handsome hero, good director, fine producer and Johnny Depp. A kind of collection of everything that you can't loose. You have every element to make rapid and entertaining action and adventure movie, the one like Pirates of the Caribbean (the first one), but no. With the length of two and half an hours and massive 250 million dollar budget, Lone Ranger is boring and predictable movie. Johnny Depp is great as a role of Tonto, but even he can't carry the whole movie. There is everything dump to this movie, action, adventure, hopeful romance, politics, bad guys, indians and heroes growth story, but nothing seems to carry enough. Maybye if you are a 10 year old boy, who like indians and western heroes, you might like this, but if you have even a little sense of wisdom this is just too much and lame. This brings flashbacks from Wild Wild West, which tried to brig back the lost glory of old western stories without any success. This is just another Wild Wild Mess. Somehow I think that even the producers of this movie has noticed it. Same day world wide distribution is just a try to minimize the loss and collect as much money that is possible with its first weekend release. Maybe it will hold it's first weekend with it's director, producer and johnny Depp, but somehow I feel that we won't see any bigger success. We'll have to wait and see what happens. If you like P.O.T.C. movies, you might like this. But if you try to find something new, don't bother. Two stars to Johnny Depp, half star to the movie. Thats all.",The Lone Ranger

You know what I think? A couple of 'critics' give an opinion that something isn't good and you will have the sheep effect'critics' all lining up for their chance to turn thumbs down on it. Well, in this case, they were just wrong. Is it too long? Sure. There are a few parts where you think, ""If they'd have grabbed this chunk and hauled it out.left out this chunk."" But, tell the truth, how many movies have you seen lately that aren't too long? It seems to be the way film makers are creating today's pictures. The longer the better. And in actuality, they aren't betterthey're just longer. Johnny Depp is great in this movie – and I was pleasantly surprised by Armie Hammer. In fact, the entire cast was good and there were plenty of laugh out loud moments. Forget listening to the lemmings who feel they have to jump over the negative cliff on this one. Go see it.

167,bravesfanc,Just OK,5,24 September 2013,"Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. But even his performance couldn't get me to really get into this action film. However, he does make it a lot better than what it would've been had he not been in the film.My first problem was Armie Hammer. He was great in ""The Social Network"" playing twins, but watching him as the lead in the movie along side Johnny Depp was just OK. But you do care of the character which to me is a very important factor in enjoying a movie, because when you don't care about a character who's a key part of the film, you lose interest.But regardless of getting technical, you don't go to watch this film for the acting, you go because it was sold as a fun family film with action packed scenes and decent one liners. And from that aspect, it succeeds. I laughed quite a bit at Depp's portrayal of ""Tonto"". His facial expressions and one liners were the best part of the movie.I give it a 5/10 because its an average movie. It won't blow people away, but it also might bore some people. I found it a bit too long as well which factored in to my score. But if you like Johnny Depp, give it a shot.",The Lone Ranger
168,jackjack-2,Big disappointment TWO thumbs down,1,9 July 2013,"My granddaughter wanted to go to the movies. Despicable 2 was sold out so we went to watch the Lone Ranger, who always was a favorite of mine. What a waste of money. It had none of the charisma that the original series had. Those who like it probably never grew up with the Lone Ranger.Casting Johnny Depp as Tonto was the biggest mistake the producers made. Everyone knows he ain't no Indian. And he is not built like the traditional Tonto. The only role that Depp could play in this movie would be that of a villain.The movie got away from what made the Lone Ranger successful. But the producers probably afraid that if Tonto played the traditional role, some of my Indian brethren would be offended so they tried to make him the hero instead of Lone Ranger's buddy. Hey, I always loved the fact that Tonto was the Lone Ranger's sidekick. He was playing a hero. Movie just proves that when a successful formula is abandoned, it is usually a disaster. Silversrone might have pulled it off but Depp never had a chance.It was one of the worst Westerns I ever watched. I made a mistake in not reading the reviews before I went but that is what you get when you go on the spur of the moment. This movie deserves a razz berry.",The Lone Ranger
169,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,6,6 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger is Disney's newest box office flop. Based on the classic radio series of the same name, The Lone Ranger features Johnny Depp – who obviously isn't a Native American – playing a Native American character named Tonto. This weird, somewhat racist casting choice is overshadowed only by the sheer anonymity of Armie Hammer, the actor who plays the title character. Directed by Gore Verbinski (the man who directed the first three Pirates movies and Rango), The Lone Ranger marks the fifth, and hopefully last, Depp-Verbinski collaboration. The Lone Ranger also marks the millionth collaboration between Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.The movie is told through the eyes of old Tonto who, while being visited by a young boy in the amusement park, remembers the story of the Lone Ranger aka John Reid and him. This narrative device makes little to no sense since the movie shows many scenes that don't contain Tonto. I mean, if he didn't witness certain events, how could he possibly have re-told them? Anyway, the main plot of the movie is that Tonto and Reid form an unlikely friendship and try to catch a dangerous bandit named Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) who killed Reid's brother and left Reid for dead. The whole plot is rather simple and predictable so I wouldn't spend much time on it.In spite of what it may seem, I don't consider The Lone Ranger to be particularly bad. Nor do I consider it to be particularly good. The term I would go with to explain this movie is watchable. But the question remains – who would watch this movie? Who is its target audience? The Lone Ranger, just like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, has a distinguishable overall adventurous tone to it and is filled with lighthearted humor; which is perfect for the younger audiences. However, the movie is almost 2 and a half hours long and does get thematically dark from time to time; which isn't all that perfect for the younger audiences. Although the movie sometimes does seem thematically bipolar, The Lone Ranger, with its astonishingly impressive action scenes and the always charming Johnny Depp, will make your money worthwhile if you decide to see it on the big screen. If you don't fall asleep because of its length.While reading some comments in the internet, I noticed that people have a problem with the movie's redundant length. I, myself, wasn't bored while watching but I do agree that some scenes and subplots weren't really required. You simply don't need to spend over 2 hours developing the most straightforward story ever – thus the movie would have definitely benefited from being shorter. I personally had some trouble with the humor which was hit or miss and some jokes were really juvenile. However, my biggest problem with the movie was something else – it was the CGI animals. I know this sounds nitpicky, but all the animals in the movie that were CGI-ed (the buffaloes, the rabbits, the scorpions) looked horrible. This movie had a $ 250 million budget. How can you have a $ 250 million budget, be able to create amazing action scenes but not be able to CGI one freaking rabbit? No wonder this movie flopped.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",The Lone Ranger
170,moviemattb,An Okay Movie,5,1 January 2015,"I am not one of the critic's that points out about the movie's budget instead of the plot; the characters; etc. So, here is my honest opinion for this movie. ""The Lone Ranger"" is based on a radio series as the movie tells about an Indian named Tonto as he teams up with John Reid as they both go on a journey to take down some of the meanest and nastiest cowboys in the west. I won't go into more detail about what the plot is because I know most of you have already know about this movie, and it has already been talked about. First I'll admit, when I first saw previews of this movie I thought it looked like a waste of money because all they do is show that this movie is going to be epic where there are train crashes, cowboys shooting with there guns, and the action scenes are over the top; that to me was poorly marketed and it doesn't give enough audience's attention in order to see this movie. So, with that said, what are my thoughts on ""The Lone Ranger?"" I thought the movie isn't as bad as what everyone is saying, but I do not think its a great movie. I just thought it was an okay movie. Half is good and half is bad. So the good thing about this movie is that I thought the cinematography is beautifully well shot, and I love the grittiness of it as it makes you feel that you are watching a spaghetti western movie or something like that. Hans Zimmer's music is actually pretty darn good, but nowhere near as awesome as he did in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies and his work on ""Man of Steel,"" which it came out the same year as this movie did. The action is of course over the top, but at the same time I was already enjoying it. Also, the acting in this movie was fine but nothing to run home about. Now the bad thing is that while the movie does have some fine humor, but I don't think the movie needs to have the same tongue and cheek quality like what the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies have done. Of course, the movie is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and it was also directed by Gore Verbinski, but I think Verbinski was the wrong choice to direct this movie because he offers nothing new to the table except do the same thing like again in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. Also, the movie starts to drag in the second act and I wish if they had cut some things out, and just get to the point. However, the first and third act are only the good parts. The characterization are developed too much, and no I don't mean I want them to be one dimensional; you do need to develop these characters but it doesn't have to be that much. Lastly, I don't think Johnny Depp is really good as Tonto. Don't get me wrong, I love Johnny Depp and I seen him in much better movies than what he did here as I am reviewing. His performance is very much the same as his other role Jack Sparrow, and I do not think he was rightfully cast in this particular kind of a role. Although he does make me laugh for sometime, but I think he should have let someone to play Tonto. Does that mean Depp is terrible? No, I thought he was just okay, but its just that he is not right for the part. So that is all I got to say about this movie. ""The Lone Ranger"" was okay, but not really the worst movie that I've ever seen. I give it a 5 out of 10.",The Lone Ranger
171,CountVladDracula,It's not that people don't like Westerns... It's that this is a bad one,1,10 January 2014,"First let me begin by saying it is NOT (contrary to popular belief) that modern audiences don't like Westerns or cannot appreciate The Lone Ranger. It's just that this is a really, really bad movie.Tonto is insane. He is a caricature here that deeply disrespects Native Americans. He was driven insane and now he ""trades"" taking valuable things and swapping them for garbage when the owner is not looking. He keeps his dead pet bird mounted on his head and periodically tries to feed it. That's not funny. It's just sad. He's not likable. He's mean and it's disrespectful to the original Lone Ranger story. Tonto was useful, intelligent, and ...even kind in the original Lone Ranger. This Tonto is heartless.Also the ""new"" meaning for Ke-mo sah-bee is just cruel. ""Wrong brother"" is constantly telling him ""Your brother should have lived and not you"" even after they become friends. That's not funny. That's mean spirited.Tonto's behavior through the whole thing, insane or not, did not sit right for me. He bashed the hero's head with a shovel when he started to wake up after the deaths of the rangers and had no qualms about burying a man a live. And then after a horse (yes, a horse) persuades him to help the lone ranger he drags the man's body, deliberately through horse droppings. (Ha freakin' ha.) And the joke is addressed later when the hero smells his own stinky hair.Tonto calls the villain a Windigo which isn't even from the Right native American tribal folk belief. Windigo is of the North East folk belief, the complete opposite side of the continent! Skin walker would have been more acceptable. Someone mixed up Skin walker (yee naaldlooshii) and didn't think anyone would notice. Whatever happened to the promise that this version would be more respectful of Native American culture? Helena Bonham Carter shows up as a madam with an artificial leg that is actually a gun. Did I mention the villain likes to mutilate people and or eat human body parts? Because... You totally need that in a Disney film.It's like watching Tim Burton's spouses run a muck.There's a ridiculous scene where a boy throws The Lone Ranger a silver bullet from the speeding train and he catches it, one handed, while on horse back. And they never properly explain that those silver bullets are used to represent how valuable life is and The Lone Ranger's promise not to kill but only wound and only in self-defense from the original stories. He also never drank or smoked either. Oh, yes, and he also ends up the love interest of his dead brother's widow here, only days after his brother's death...So you see, those that think The Lone Ranger failed because people don't like Westerns anymore have it wrong. It's not that we can't like Westerns. It's just that this is a bad, bad movie. Watch the old black and white ones, they're free on Hulu and surprisingly more respectful to Native Americans...",The Lone Ranger
172,bjones,Disappointing,5,11 July 2013,"This movie was certainly different. It is a well made production for sure with a lot of very well staged action. However, the action did get a bit ridiculous and overblown. To compensate for this it seems that Johnny Depp played kind of a clown version of Tonto, in the same way he was a clownish pirate in Pirates of the Carribbean. That's not too surprising considering that some of the people involved with Pirates made this movie. They were obviously trying to duplicate the success of the pirate films. In doing so here they made one huge error. The error was in using such an iconic story without considering that too many people would be disappointed. By contrast, in the pirate films they invented a new icon, so to speak, while it could be said here that they are trying to destroy one. The rest of the cast did a good job with what they were given. Ruth Wilson played a mildly insipid love interest for the Lobe Ranger and his brother (yes, one of those). The only performance I really liked much was by James Badge Dale who played a Texas Ranger brother to the Lone Ranger. His character felt more real. Barry Pepper played an interesting Custeresque soldier that at least entertained. Traditionally great performances were turned in by Tom Wilkenson and William Fichtner; both villains. But the villains were all so stereotyped it was boring. Much of the rest of the cast just seemed to disappear under endless grime. Most disappointingly, Armie Hammer played the Lone Ranger part as a Dudly Do-Right of the Mounties kind of thing. I just have never liked actors playing parts that depict what are supposed to be normal men in such a negative way, like stupid and clueless. He was both. It's insulting and demeaning.As a result of all this the filmmakers delivered something that bears no resemblance to the regular Lone Ranger we all remember. I guess only Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels can be the real ones. The film was more in the way of a spoof of westerns. I usually think of such things as made by pseudo-intellectuals who can't bear to take themselves too seriously and/or who don't want to take any kind of American icon seriously; as though they just can't believe anything good can actually exist. They have to make fun of it, which just shows a complete lack of respect for mainstream Americans. In short, they're insulting their audience. Almost unforgivably, the overlong final action scene just got boring in its predictability. It's too bad they couldn't come up with something more original than the Keystone Cops. In fact, the entire movie was way too long. They could have easily cut it to about ninety minutes and probably would have had a better film as a result. In the end, the most enjoyably consistent thing in this jumble are the two young boys who played Danny Reid and Will; played respectively by Bryant Prince and Mason Elston Cook. I also noticed they played their parts straight. They were both good, especially Cook.",The Lone Ranger

Then at the 3/4 point there is a sequence which occurs where the characters behave inexplicably, almost forcefully acting against previously established character in order to further the plot and it REALLY stands out. The finale was almost too choreographed, and a lot of Tonto's stuff seemed a bit forced, as did the double train stuff, but it's hard to argue that the William Tell overture wasn't darned fun to hear..Overall i have to give this a 7 out of 10.

175,Simon_J_Rodgers,Totally exceeded my expectations,10,5 August 2013,"I saw this film at a preview showing on 4th August 2013 and I had never really bothered with the Lone Ranger in the past at all. As a result, I did not know a great deal about the programmes and films which were made in the past. Therefore I went to see this film with a total open unbiased mind. Despite this, it was clear to see that this film benefited from special effects which were just not possible back in the days of previous adaptations.As a rule I don't tend to like films which centre on flashbacks but this film uses these to good effect. I also don't really like films where events are deliberately left out of chronological order however again this film does that a little (not too much, but a little) and again this does not cause any difficulties with the flow of the film.I was also a little wary of watching a film which was 149 minutes long (just under two and a half hours) as there would most likely be some ""filler"" in to stretch it out. Again there was very little. I was also surprised at the issues which were raised with regards to parental advisory. Some are very well justified but some are barely noticeable. This is definitely not a family film. I would say it would be suitable for teen children onwards. I'm glad my seven year old son didn't come with me to see this as some parts may have played on his mind afterwards.The acting was very well done and there are some character twists towards the end which I was not expecting. The special effects as I mentioned were certainly special (and it was only a 2D showing) and each scene keeps the viewer watching and interested. I sometimes have trouble keeping awake during long films but not this time! This film really did keep me going, which is saying a great deal! Each scene got more intense than the previous one, with the all massive finale towards the end. I thought the use of the William Tell Overture during the final scene would have been banal and old fashioned due to overuse in the past but I was wrong! It would be very safe and fair to say that nothing you may have seen before will prepare you for this film, it would have to be seen to be believed.There were some interesting moral issues such as the Lone Ranger himself breaking away from the law to try to provide justice himself, he then refused his new legal honour afterwards because it conflicted with his new beliefs. It also shows how despite his arguments with Tonto, they were still good friends. There is proof that quite often, some people are not exactly as you may expect them to be.All in all, the film totally exceeded my expectations and it really went to show me what a good film is made of.",The Lone Ranger
176,he88,Nothing To See Here Folks,3,15 April 2014,"First off I need to point out that I saw this on my TV and not in a theater so I didn't have the over all visual effect that apparently made a huge difference for those who really liked this movie. Having said that though...The movie on its own accord was a real stinker. I just got fed up with it a little more than half way through (Close to an hour and a half for this movie) and erased it from my DVR.I'm old enough to remember the original when I was a little kid, but even more so I remember the Lone Ranger comics. In the comics the Lone Ranger was basically Batman and Robin of the old west. The lone Ranger was a sharp shooter who could fight really well (And somehow still kept his clothes clean most of the time) and Tonto basically was a tracker who was also great with a bow, knife, and tomahawk. These guys like Batman and Robin also did a lot of acrobatics during their going after the bad guys. This movie basically avoided all that and made a bumbling Lone Ranger with a half nuts Tonto as a side kick. Instead of making it a serious crime fighting adventure they dumbed it down with comedy that was very hit and miss, and bad guys who were also very hit and miss for their extreme dumb and dumber routines.One of the big problems Hollywood has with trying to remake classics (Especially classics that ran as TV series) is that they seldom understand what made them work in the first place. Quite often what played a big part was the times they were shot in. When the Lone Ranger was big it was in a time when John Wayne was king of cowboy movies and for the most part action adventures were either westerns or war movies. So to take a series from that era and try to make it this comic relief addition just misses the whole point. So once you lose the big screen special effects and have just the stories merit to go on....Well folks....There's nothing to see here",The Lone Ranger
177,joseesrocha,I liked it!!!,8,22 August 2020,"This movie is not as bad as they say !!! THE LONE RANGER is an ""explosive"" film, the performances, the soundtrack and cinematography are good, the action scenes involving trains are breathtaking, the only problem with the film for me is the exaggerated comedy in a film of this kind, but I advise you to watch this movie !!!",The Lone Ranger
178,walsh-22,Not as bad as I had heard,7,4 May 2014,"The Lone Ranger is about an idealistic lawyer John Reid played by Armie Hammer who with his brother, a ranger and posse of men are ambushed while trying to bring in notorious Butch Cavendish.John is left for dead but Tonto, a renegade Comanche played by Johnny Depp saves him and offers to help him get justice for his dead brother.I had heard reviews from the film critics who really slagged this film off so with trepidation I watched the film but to be honest, I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would.I will admit that I found the film too long that is why I didn't score it 10 out of 10. The John Reid character is very annoying at the beginning but when it comes to the end of the film and he's riding his horse on top of a train while shooting and the Lone Ranger theme song playing you can't help cheering him on.There are some amazing action sequences and very funny scenes particularly concerning the spirit horse. I enjoyed the interaction between Reid and Tonto and liked that there was the side story to what makes Tonto the man he is.On the whole, not a bad film at all.",The Lone Ranger
179,valen060,Disney Western-Action Film that Delivers,9,7 July 2013,"After hearing so much negative word-of-mouth over ""The Lone Ranger,"" I had to see for myself if it lived up to those criticisms. Not surprisingly, ""disappointment"" does NOT exist in my vocabulary to describe this movie. Stars Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp actually had good chemistry as comrades John Reid (aka Lone Ranger) and Tonto respectively. Based on what I had observed about the movie, it has similar elements used in past films like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies (the unusual action quirks and mannerisms delivered by Depp as he did as Captain Jack Sparrow) and ""John Carter"" (the titular character tries to fit in with his new surroundings after losing the life he's been once accustomed to), however it's a western-action film that kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to make sense of the entire plot.So, the story is about an ex-lawman who seeks vengeance over the death of his brother and then comes across a seemingly eccentric Native American named Tonto, who teaches him the ways of bringing proper justice under a new identity as a vigilante.The reunion of Director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and actor Johnny Depp proved that with these three names involved in one movie, it reassured me that all would turn out fine. With Hammer's image as those Winklevoss characters from the 2010 film ""The Social Network"" still fresh in mind, him now portraying a scruffy-looking western figure looks as if he can actually step up as the lead. Although I'll admit Depp's Tonto does tend to steal the spotlight from him on several good portions of the movie, the elaborate and complex action scenes involving destruction and moments of quick-witted humor with the duo nonetheless keep the story from being de-railed. Verbinski's/Depp's last outing ""Rango"" had a similar take of the Old West as this movie, but this is the same impression I felt on Verbinski's first 'Pirates' film back in 2003: An unlikely hero who decides to define ""justice"" in his own right (whether intentional or not).",The Lone Ranger
180,scott-sw,All style with no substance,3,3 July 2013,"""Something wrong with that horse,"" said Tonto. No, there's a lot of things wrong with Jerry Bruckheimer's and Gore Vebrenski's re-imagining of the Lone Ranger. John Reid is a Texan who comes home to civilize the west through his law degree. On the train ride into his hometown, where he hopes to meet his brother again, Butch Cavendish is being transported for a hanging for all his crimes. Also being taken there is Tonto. Of course, Cavendish escapes. He then starts making raids to frame the Comanche in order to start a war with the whites. This takes place with the backdrop of the completion of the Trans-Continental Railroad in 1869. One of those railroad barons (played by the dapper Tom Wilkinson) is not the great guy he seems to be. He is hatching something. We also learn of Tonto's sin, as to why he is cast out of the Comanche tribe and his attempt for redemption. Well, all the Texas Rangers got killed, John Reid survives and becomes the masked man with a white spirit horse. You should know the rest of the story. Is it funny? Yes. Is it a fun time at the movies? A little bit. Those two positives - along with Johnny Depp aren't enough to save this mess. First, Johnny Depp, while very talented is the lead and makes the Lone Ranger (John Reid) a side-kick. Depp is funny, off the wall, and the leader to help Armie Hammer's Reid get on track. But that is a major detractor from the ongoing story line. Also, the movie goes campy - too campy. As seen in the trailers, you see the Lone Ranger riding Silver atop rooftops of the town and the train. At one point, Silver is galloping inside the train. And the stunts with the trains get downright silly. And while I'm no fan of political correctness, Tonto's Native American make-up and manners is troublesome at best and irritable at worst. Then there is the story's historical flaws. I know it's a movie - but the Trans-Continental Railroad was nowhere near Texas at any point. Then there are multiple tracks that were built as well. In the end, you have a movie that makes the 1981 motion picture look like an Oscar winner. Save your money ... and your sanity.",The Lone Ranger
181,s_campanale,Once upon a time in the West there was a Little Big Man - Classics Loan Ranger gravitas but steal Summer fun,7,13 August 2013,"This film has become the latest high profile casualty of the multiplex wars, with a savaging in the States months before it arrived here in Europe and an odd marketing campaign. A surprise therefore that the movie itself (all 2 & half hours) proves to be a good western, but a poor summer film.The film's main problem, as many have pointed out, is the jarring clash of tones and moods. It seems as if Verbinski, Haythe, and the others set out to make a serious adult Western, inspired directly by both the Spaghetti Westerns and the US revisionist Westerns that followed in the 60s and 70s, yet also tried to make it a fun, rollicking old West adventure for all the family. Understandably, such an enterprise seems doomed to fail at some point or another, if only because one would cancel the other out, or make it look like watching two separate films spliced together as greedy old B-movie producers used to do. So it has proved alas to be.The film's most obvious inspirations are 1969's ""Little Big Man"", complete with an aged, shambling Tonto retelling his story to a latter day audience as framing device and an end of the Indian nation narrative, and Sergio Leone's ""Once upon a time in the West"" (whose classic Morricone score is openly quoted in Zimmer's music) complete with the power-mad railway man with a vision of the future at any cost in an uneasy relationship with the psychopathic outlaw killer, fought by a vengeance seeking gunslinger and a feisty widow. There's also a pinch of ""The Man who shot Liberty Vallance"" in there with the naive city lawyer discovering that his fine words and books of law count for nothing in the violent West. Into this dour blend are introduced The Lone Ranger and Tonto, though almost nothing of the original incarnation's remains (it's an origins story) There is some comedy in the film, as there was in the 2 main inspirations, mainly in the interplay between Tonto and Reid/Ranger in a ""mismatched buddy"" partnership. There are a few exciting Western set pieces scattered around, the most spectacular being the two train chase- crash scenes, one at the start marking the pairs unlikely meeting, and the final one which sees the villains and their silver hoarding-selling- railway domination scheme undone in a confusing yet exhilarating train chase where combatants jump from carriage to carriage and train to train dodging obstacles and fighting it out with whatever weapon comes to hand, all to the tune of a cleverly reworked version of the Rangers signature tune ""The William Tell overture"" done to the beat of a train engine to match the action.The actors all do a good job with their parts. Depp basically plays himself again as the rouge Comanche Tonto complete with ""Crow"" like face paint and an actual Crow on his head, so no change there. Armie Hammer plays the supposed name hero John Reid/""The Lone Ranger"" as a bungling, well-meaning fool who has greatness thrust upon him and sort of lives up to the job eventually. Helena Bonham Carter, seemingly in the film only for a name match with Depp (Burton owed Verbinski a favour?) does well as the whorehouse madam with a lethal ivory leg, but she is a cameo at best despite what the marketing tells you (5 minutes tops). The increasingly ubiquitous James Badge Dale appears in his 3rd summer blockbuster as Reid's ill-fated brother, while Ruth Wilson plays his feisty widow and Reid's true love Rebecca. On the villain side, William Fitchner is suitably sick and menacing as the cannibal outlaw Butch Cavendish, Barry Pepper manages to draw sympathy from the conflicted Cavalry captain who finds he is committing genocide on a lie, while Tom Wilkinson has the blend of vision and ruthlessness needed for ""Mr Choo- Choo"" Cole (John Reid was revealed to be the great grandfather of Britt Reed ""The Green Hornet"". In the 2011 movie Wilkinson played Britt's father, meaning that he would be his own adversary's grandson? Well he spent a long time with Rebecca on that train!)In keeping with the Spaghetti/Revisionist inspiration, the film is also quite violent and brutal, with none of the romance and innocence the LR represented. Bullets rip into their victims with sickening thuds and sprays of blood, sending their bodies flying in slow motion. Arrows hew into victims' bodies without mercy, and Texas Rangers, Comanche Indians and US Cavalrymen are cut down in waves. Also outlaw Butch Cavendish is a cannibal, who eats parts of his victims Indian-style as trophies. Kudos to Verbinski for showing his cutting out Dan Reid's still beating heart and eating it in front of him in such a disguised way that it can still pass PG13 regulations. This, complete with other more cartoony violence (decapitation by beam) and the sleaziness of Red's whorehouse make the film decidedly family-unfriendly, but then the film does not really seem made for children. It is dark and dour most of the time, with a complicated storyline and a melancholy air that stays to the end with a long behind the credits sequence of the aged Tonto walking back into the desert over a mournful musical lament.Therein lies the film's main mystery, a tough adult film sold as a huge tent pole Summer family draw! Respect should be given to Verbinski and co for making a serious ""Lone Ranger"" movie when a cartoon or a parody would have been the most obvious direction, and as with recent flops like ""John Carter of Mars"" and ""Tron Legacy"", it is a film that is ripe for rediscovery and reappraisal in years to come. For now it has to suffer the same indignity that so many other ""greats"" did at the time of their release",The Lone Ranger

184,daviddaphneredding,What kind of movie was it?,7,3 July 2013,"Ever since growing up with ""The Lone Ranger"" in the 50's and having been an avid western fan, I've always liked the story, seeing it on TV every Saturday (and sometimes Sundays)in, again, my boyhood days. And this movie was exciting. But I will have to be frank and say that there were times when the corny one-liners simply did get on my nerves. There was plenty of exciting action, and I liked it, but after hearing the script after the first few minutes, I did wonder what kind of movie it was supposed to be. Was it supposed to be a western comedy or a comedic western? If there was to be present the ancient characteristic of drama known as comic relief, they overdid that. The corny lines caused me to wonder, again, what type of movie it was intended to be. I've read some of the critics' reviews, and I thought they were maybe too hard in places. But the critics were right to be harsh about the allegedly funny lines; they were untimely groaners. In all fairness I will have to say that Johnny Depp was good as Tonto, and Armie Hammer was good as the Lone Ranger; Ruth Wilson was an attractive addition to the cast. And too, I liked the rustic Old West beauty of the sets of New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Also, I liked the music, especially the William Tell Overture. And, Depp and Gore Verbinski showed good capability. But, to reiterate, don't overdo the comic relief. Though the movie was one I liked, keep a western a western and a comedy a comedy.",The Lone Ranger

186,JamesIan2021,"20 Minutes Too Long, Still Awesome Though",5,16 May 2015,"This is the most unfairly reviewed movie of 2013, I get the feeling critics jumped on the bandwagon of ""it went through production hell so it must be bad"". Yes it did go through hell from budget issues and shooting problems, but the end product is a long train ride of big laughs and whopping action! The enormous budget shows, the sets are beautiful from long train roads, lavishly designed carriages and huge western towns, the whole 1930's vibe and look is near perfect. Armie Hammer is really good, he does the slapstick jokes justice and emphasises his heroic nature of John Reid, plus Johnny Depp is unrecognisable on fine quirky form as Tonto. Tom Wilkinson and William Fichtner are two very dark bad guys, it's refreshing to see baddies that show no mercy. Ruth Wilson is strong British talent, she nails her accent and I'm glad she was featured in the action scenes, plus Helena Bonham Carter is a blast, literally, with her gun toting plastic leg. Whilst Lone Ranger has some slow patches and the run time is unnecessarily longer than needed, throughout this adventure are wild bloody shootouts, scenes of peril for the crazy duo and undoubtedly one of the best action sequences of the year which sees all the main cast fight on-board a runaway train alongside a treacherously steep canyon. The scale is insanely impressive with flawless visuals and a rocketing pace, the momentum is dizzyingly entertaining and I loved the famous music played over the top, it will leave a big smile on your face. Gore Verbinski's latest movie shouts scale and it shows, this is a blast, ideal for a movie night and a guaranteed good time.",The Lone Ranger

Even the two undeserved Oscar nominations it has received should not deceive you...the writing, the acting, the length of the film, just all horrible. Watching this was truly a painful experience.

188,McFrogg,The Legend of the Wrong Ranger and Chief Jack Sparrow,1,20 April 2017,"Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be tied to a horse and dragged through a mountain of cow dung. Who is this even made for? Not Lone Ranger fans. People complained about Batman & Robin, but at least they didn't portray Batman as a clown in that movie. Imagine if they made a version where Bruce Wayne was a scrawny and ineffective wimp who had to be saved by Robin all the time. Is it made for kids? Not at all. Butch Cavendish cuts out human hearts and eats them. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. Imagine if The Joker killed a guy in the upcoming Batman, took out his intestines and used them as suspenders. There's a strange scene with scary-looking, meat eating rabbits. Why? I don't know. Something tells me the director and Johnny Depp used most of the movie's budget on drugs. Then, a bunch of Indians are brutally slaughtered, but don't worry, the scene ends with a hilarious scene involving Lone Ranger's horse Silver, so everything's alright! And as usual, the stupid and evil Christians are the villains. I wonder what would happen if someone portrayed Jews or Buddhists in the same fashion? Most people would be offended by it, and rightly so. I can't remember how long the movie was, but it felt like seven hours. I don't know how they managed to make a movie about the Lone Ranger so boring. They robbed us when we bought the ticket/DVD, and then they decided to torture us as well. It's clearly made by a sadist.The real action starts near the very end of the movie, with the William Tell overture and all. The director almost manipulated me into believing his movie was great for a second or two. He's the real villain in this. The sound of hooves beating the ground during the action scene was probably just an edited sound recording of Clayton Moore and Walt Disney turning in their graves.Filmmakers today don't give a darn about heroes like The Lone Ranger, and what they stand for. They just want to ridicule them or change them into something unrecognizable or politically correct. Please, just leave The Lone Ranger alone. Let him rest in peace.",The Lone Ranger
189,BibChr,"Reluctantly: this time, listen to the critics",3,11 January 2014,"I watched The Lone Ranger both prepared and expecting to differ with the critics. I know how awful they can be, how wrong they can be, how hyena-pack-like they (and all media) can be. I've loved movies they hated. The trailers for TLR were great. Sometimes, critics hate movies just for being fun, and I figured this was another such case.Yeah, well: wrong.This is not a good movie. This is pieces of a good movie, sadly not sewn together into a good movie. There are a few good sequences, but a few good sequences doth not a coherent fun film make.Here's the heart of it: it's awfully hard to like a movie titled The Lone Ranger if you just can't like the Lone Ranger. And I didn't.His character is obnoxious, and has no arc. He starts off dumb and clueless, and he ends up dumb and clueless. His main function is to prevent good resolutions from occurring, and to provide a straight man for Tonto.There's the second heart of it. A more accurate title would have been ""Tonto."" The movie belongs to Depp, who is a lot of fun to watch and provides most of the interest and chuckles.But even he is a puzzler. We're told, for instance, that TLR died. Really? What I see is that he's NOT dead. He grabs Tonto's hand... and then Tonto conks him with a rock! It brings a chuckle, until your brain kicks into fire and you think, ""So then, the hero — Tonto — is the sort of guy who assaults nearly-dead INNOCENT GOOD GUYS so he can have a corpse to rob and bury?"" That's never resolved.A lot is never resolved. As I say, TLR himself has no real arc. He's just an irritant. But one of the emotional foci of the movie is this really, really despicable bad guy who eats others' body-parts — indeed, cuts out and eats the heart from TLR's brother. He's a loathsome beast (Butch, played by William Fichtner).So what is Butch's satisfying resolution? Big showdown where TLR kills him? or where Tonto kills him? or where he's even locked up?Nope. Maybe Verbinski was counting on people not watching closely, but we saw Big Bad Guy jump off the train before it crashed. So he presumably survived... and disappeared from the film. Unresolved. We're supposed to transfer our hate to Tom Wilkinson, who just isn't as hateful as Big Bad Guy.I could go on and on, but the point is: there are good actors here, wasted; good scenery, wasted; and good sequences, afloat in a failure of a movie.Dang, I hate agreeing with the critics. But this time they were right.",The Lone Ranger
190,jackbanister16,Why was this panned?,7,16 January 2014,"I'm actually surprised that this was panned by the critics. It was a decent movie, maybe even slightly better than I was expecting! I had read articles which stated that it was a box office disaster and after scanning Wikipedia also saw that it was almost universally panned by the critics. I just don't get it.THE GOOD:I just had fun watching it. Isn't that why we go to the movies? To be entertained?? Well paced film. I never felt bored or uninterested in the movie.Superb cinematography! The film was so beautifully shot. Really captured the essence of the Wild Wild West! Kudos to the DP.Great performances. I was fully expecting another Captain Jack Sparrow esque performance from Johnny Depp, but he played Tonto so well! Funny and deep character! Unfortunately I never watched the Lone Ranger of old so I can't compare, but I was pretty interested in the plot.Good score. I'd recognize that fanfare from anywhere!THE BAD:Why was the sub plot with Helena Bonham Carter necessary? It kind of took away from the film about for me. Does she actually act or does she just make cameos.I didn't overly care for the actor who played the Lone Ranger. He didn't do a bad job by any means, but he wasn't overly memorable. He had the look down but just didn't add much personality to the character. Maybe that's a scripting issue.Dialogue wasn't as sharp and funny as I was hoping for, the humor was mostly situational. I agree with the cast and those involved with the film, I think the ""critics"" made up their mind on this film long before it came out as well. They saw that it had a delayed production schedule and that it was a Western, not to mention a ""reboot"" of sorts and instantly thought, BAD! While it's not the most amazing movie shot on film, it's definitely better than about 80% of what was out this summer and deserved more recognition than it got. I think this movie probably got hammered for a few reasons:1.) It came out against a children's movie (Despicable Me 2). 2.) Westerns aren't as bankable as they used to be (sadly). 3.) Johnny Depp's last couple movies haven't done well. 4.) The critics made up their mind on the movie leading people to avoid.All these factors combined to give it poor circulation which is a shame.

This year just about every movie looked bad to me. Out of desperation I tried this movie. I thought ""It's Disney how bad can it be? At the very least it will be quality entertainment. It has great actors in it.""Well it turned out exactly how I expected. It's Disney so it's quality. It's fun to watch. But make no mistake this is a box office bomb.

You could not afford to take the green out? Really? In a DESERT WHERE is there GREEN? Really? Did the lazy CGI people just think 'it will just blend in with the grass' there is no grass!The action was fun to watch, hard to believe, but what do you want? That is all this movie has going for it. That and the good acting. The best parts were Helena Bonham Carter's scenes. To me she was the BEST thing in the movie! She was terribly underused. Omg the part where the guy introduced Tonto and Reid as ""Two freaks here to see you"" was laugh out loud funny! Also memorable was the scene where she distracts the bad guys. It was truly delicious to watch her performance. Shame it was so little. Depp delivers as usual. But there is nothing there. Also the so called chemistry between Reid and Rebecca is pretty non existent. Heck there was more chemistry between Butch & Rebecca! That one scene where he leans in close to her, too hot! The scene where she slaps Reid (for no reason) then kisses him was passionless.Not much else to say, since there was not much else to the movie. It was a bit gory, I was surprised a mainstream Disney movie 'went there.' I mean they said this Butch person would eat people's organs, wow....not sure what the point of that was. Along with many other things that were simply loose ends. Like how the animals were violent, and why all those people needed to be killed. Really brutal if you ask me. The whole Lone Ranger's stance on guns, not sure if this was in the original. But if not seems like it's a statement about all the shootings that have been happening recently.

It's not because it didn't have a ton of adventure and great cinematography, but because the story was on the weak side and the acting went far over ""funny"" into the world of ""campy"". So many items were wrong with the period aspect (terminology and expressions that were much more 20th century than 19th century) and, though I think Johnny Depp is an incredible actor, his Tonto was so overplayed that I just couldn't get into it. In my opinion, the ""star"" of the movie was probably ""Silver"" (the white horse of The Lone Ranger) who was a beautiful, well-trained creature. I really hate to not give this movie a higher rating as I could certainly appreciate the incredible hard work it must have taken to make this, but it was just ""goofy"" as opposed to funny and adventurous.

195,billteller,It's a comedy,7,1 August 2021,"When this first came out, I thought it was horrible. They messed up William Tell Overture, which kinda pissed me off. (Long story. Don't ask.) The movie was more The Tonto Show which was also rather frustrating.A few years pass and I watch it again because nothing else worthwhile was on tv. I realized it was not a drama, it was a comedy. Whatever you want to call it, it was funny. I would recommend giving this movie a second chance, keeping in mind it should not be taken too seriously. Ignore the mistakes and just try to enjoy it.",The Lone Ranger
196,slicedbread117,An uninspired and disappointing film.,6,27 August 2013,"If someone asked me to describe The Lone Ranger in one word, I would say uninspiring. Before release, The Lone Ranger looked like it could be Disney's next big thing like Pirates of the Caribbean was back a decade ago, but it failed to meet expectations. For me, The Lone Ranger will forever be a movie that I think of what could've been.I'm going to start by talking about what killed the movie the most for me. The answer is Armie Hammer, playing the lead character John Reid/The Lone Ranger. While the movie tries to create an action hero that fights for justice in the Lone Ranger, any attempts at making the Lone Ranger the next big marketable hero failed. Never once during the movie did I ever feel like the Lone Ranger was a true action hero that I could stand up and scream at for being a total bad ass. Armie Hammer's portrayal of the title character was weak, and the script didn't help either, full of clichéd action moments that just didn't make me feel any sort of rush. For example, at one point in the beginning of the film, John Reid accidentally lets a little girl's doll fly out the window of a moving train and we see the doll soar back in the wind. Later on during an action scene, John is riding a horse next to a high speed train, and his nephew throws him a bullet from inside of the train landing perfectly in John's hand. You're telling me that a doll will fly back in the wind but not a bullet? It's just action clichés like those that didn't have any of that awesomeness behind it. The Lone Ranger himself was simply an uninspired and incomplete character, never giving you any reason to care about him or his story.The story of the movie is told through the eyes and memories of Tonto, played by the legendary Johnny Depp. While the story and the movie seemed to drag at certain times, I'm happy to report that Johnny Depp was far and away the best part about the movie. Depp provided all of the comedic relief for the film, and at times I was wishing that he would've played both Tonto and the Lone Ranger. Overall, the story was not great but not awful. Despite the overly long run time of the movie, the story kept me interested enough to keep watching. Another solid part of the movie was William Fichtner's role as antagonist Butch Cavendish. While he wasn't a fantastic villain, Cavendish was nasty enough to make for an enjoyable villain that provided a gritty tone for parts of the movie.So, is The Lone Ranger worth a view? To some, fans of Johnny Depp and old-school westerns, yes. Despite all of the clichés, the action still has it's strong moments. Besides the occasional, tolerable action scenes and the performances of Johnny Depp and William Fitcher, the movie as a whole falls short. The very poor and disappointing lead character, dragging moments (due to an upward of a 3 hour film), less than OK story and uninspired, clichéd action moments plunged any hope of creating a new Disney classic into a soon to be forgotten film.6/10",The Lone Ranger
197,pressboard,Great performances and ever better humor,7,5 July 2013,"I read some of the Hated it reviews and have been hearing bad word of mouth but went to see this anyway and was very pleased. My wife and I, both in the ""saw this series when we were kids"" category, thought it was really funny and had a good balance of the serious and humorous, with most performances falling on the humorous side. The villains were nasty but not in a really serious way. Depp carries much of this as the mystical Tonto and Armie Hammer does a good bumbling Lone Ranger. This movie was never intended to be even as serious as the television series and it succeeds very well with that approach. Each of the actors does their character turns as expected and with some panache. My wife and I laughed through the entire movie at moments of very well placed lines and were very satisfied as the credits rolled up. As an aside, we may have been the only people in the theater laughing like this. I would recommend the movie to anyone who does not hold strong preconceived ideas of how the remake should have been done and is ready for the something funny and engaging. Definitely does not deserve the Hate reviews it has received. I went with some prejudice after seeing the poorly done trailers but the well done production overcame my criticisms.",The Lone Ranger
198,holyspiritdriven,Hollywood Remakes Another Hero by Deflating Him,7,5 July 2013,"I have to separate myself from my tiny little involvement as an extra in this film to write a fair review. Let's start with the bad: After having been a part of the Moab, Utah shoot I decided I had better brush up on my Lone Ranger knowledge and so I bought a DVD of the first few black & white episodes and watched them all. The Lone Ranger was an epic character. He was a courageous, fearless good guy who, with his horse silver and his signature silver bullets, became a legend in the old west. In this 2013 rendition, he is reduced to a cowardly wimp who is scared of guns. When you cut away all the action sequences, he really didn't bring anyone to justice, little lone Cavendish. I am so tired of our modern cinema's reliance on special effects rather than plot lines to tell stories. There were plenty of my pet peeve moments when I'm left rolling my eyes going ""yeah right!"", like when Tonto jumps from one train 40 or 50 feet down to another movie train & it doesn't break both of his legs. Though I think Johnny Depp is great actor, I think his personality & his version of Tonto made this into a huge Depp-fest whereas they could have given the role to a full-blooded Native American to give them honor & stay true to the story. Another bone I have to pick is the senseless deprecation of Christians or, I guess, ""church folk"" in this movie. They are made to look like a bunch of backwoods, nerdy, half brained dogmatists preaching hellfire & brimstone. What was the point in that? Also John Reid makes it a point to show that his ""Bible"" is a law book, rather than the Bible. The original Lone Ranger could actual be seen quoting the Bible in the old black & white episodes! OK, now for the good: This movie is a high-budget non-stop adventure. It's fun to watch & is has a good amount of humor dispersed throughout. I enjoyed the aspects where they stayed true to the original story. The look & feel of the film seems authentic and is overall visually exciting, not to mention filmed in beautiful locations. If you really liked movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, then you will probably like The Lone Ranger.",The Lone Ranger
199,MajorBaleegh,The Lone Ranger,9,27 October 2013,"The movie about an American Ranger and his partner an Indian Comanche; both of them fight for justice to be ensured but in their own native styles. The ranger want to ensure justice through law where as the Comanche wants to ensure justice as per his own personal wish. The action scenes were pretty good and the cinematography was excellent and as I happened to watch on a 14 GB size 1080p, it looked pretty well. The comedy part of the movie was extra-ordinary as Johnny Depp has something very special which you won't find in other actors and he has mastery in this field that during a comedy scene his expressions are worth watching. The greed for the silver by the bad guys was shown in the perfect way and the Indian's attack was very deliberate with all possible details and it was well coordinated with reality and perfection. Overall I will rate this movie 9 out of 10 as this movie has all the necessary ingredients like action, fighting scenes, little romance, comedy and resemblance to the Indian culture. The mistake done by the Comanche in the childhood was cleared up in a fashion that he corrected his fault and left the bad guys buried under their own silver deep in the river. It's a good movie that will really make your money worth its price.",The Lone Ranger

NO. 2) Do I think this is the best film of 2013? NO. 3) Do I even think this is the best film of the 2013 summer? Well, no.However, I still really enjoyed what Disney's mega western had to offer. I found it to be a very fun and manic ride, and I do believe the film has a sense of worth and genuine merit that has been glossed over or just straight up ignored due to the meat grinder that was its critical reception. It is flawed, don't get me wrong, but I believe there is more going on with 'Lone Ranger' beyond what you might think.In this analysis, I will endeavour to explain my reasons as best as I can and perhaps clarify things for those who have seen it and are still on the fence about their sentiments, or for those who haven't seen it and are curious. I will be evaluating the whole affair, and discussing what I felt went wrong with the lead up to and the subsequent marketing of the film to a mass audience, and even my own issues with the film.

203,coastdaze,Hi Ho Silver and away!!!,10,4 July 2013,"IGNORE any bad reviews of this movie. Here's another great summer comedy (also see The Heat) but without the R rating so it's a good family movie. I laughed and laughed at this movie. I was thinking it was going to be a serious take on the Lone Ranger (yeah, yeah I know...even with Johnny Depp). But very quickly as the movie progressed I was laughing and having a great time watching these two.Johnny Depp is a master at facial expressions and this type of comedic timing. Sort of like Jack Sparrow but without the flamboyance. I was totally entertained the whole time he was in a scene in this ""long"" movie which went by very fast. The other actors also did a good supporting job with just enough drama to add to this movie rather than distract.The scenery is awesome and the action scenes are beautifully photographed or green screened, CGI'd or real...whatever. I have nothing negative to say about this one...funny, no gratuitous sex, violence or language, imo. Just fun. What a nice break...I do believe I'm going to see it again!",The Lone Ranger
204,H_Spengler,I paid money to see this,2,17 June 2014,"I saw this movie with my two cousins. We sat slack jawed for nearly 2 hours while we waited for the Lone Ranger to show up. I don't always agree with critics, sometimes they won't like movies that I do, and vice versa, so I thought give it a shot in case this was one of them. Nope. This movie would've been great if it has been the first half hour, and the last half hour. Instead, it was needlessly over complicated with as many characters shoe horned in a possible. the bad and how to fix it: Tonto. I know some people didn't like Depp. I didn't mind Depp. But there was absolutely no reason to elaborate into his character as much as they did. He's the sidekick, the helper, perhaps give him a few minutes of story exposition so he has a motivation, but no longer than that. And enough of the quirkiness...Tonto doesn't need to be quirky, or really humorous. I just sat there rolling my eyes after a while saying ""let's get on with it.""Nix the wife and kid. Yeah. Nothing to throw the emotional undertone more off than being in love with your dead brother's wife, especially all while trying to avenge his death, throw in annoying kid to boot, and this storyline becomes even worse. I would've thought becoming the ranger and avenging your brother's death would have been sufficient motivation. They should've never been in this film, any generic damsel in distress would've done fine if you insist.The kidnapping of said wife and kid. Once again, catching the bad guy should've been enough, this was a big stupid add on.Too busy. There's too much going on, and none of it interesting enough for me to recall almost a year later. Some crap about a hostile takeover? A third layer of villains? Corrupt and immoral confederate soldiers? (are they confederate or just army, I don't know, it doesn't matter really, it was completely unnecessary.)A waste of Barry Pepper, and his time. You could've just had a movie about the bad guy killing the brother (and other lawmen) AND stealing silver, and the ranger stopping both, that would have been sufficient. The Horse: Really, Enough about it being an unusual horse, or doing weird things, Why all this attention on the horse. Removal of the whole museum subplot and scenes...depressing.And why all the non-sense about the Ranger's reluctance to impart some justice...the first or second time fine....the 15th or 16th...starting to draw thin. Obviously by the book isn't working.The Good: The last half hour. When the Lone Ranger music started playing, I finally felt like I was in a Lone Ranger movie. I had no problem with the entire ensuing train chase scene, I found it refreshing, tense, and well done, (especially after the butt numbing boring 2 hours preceding it.Armie Hammer. I Liked him as the Ranger. I liked his acting, handsome guy and has the look of the Ranger, he tried, he really did, it's not his fault the script sucked, and he was forced to cough out some of the worst dialog ever written. William Fichtner. Great villain, great actor. Why needlessly over-complicate his role? And why the cannibalism? Shock Value? I never was able to figure it out unless the writers figured it would make for a great ""heart"" related line later on in the movie. The scenery and sets/costumes are amazing and the cinematography is well done. The West is Gorgeous.Here's a good Lone Ranger movie plot: Ranger's brother, a good man, killed, possibly in group ambush that includes other brother. Tonto finds, other brother barely alive, nurses him to health, brother vows to bring evildoers to justice, but is reluctant to stoop to the same level to do so...all the while training to be ranger with Tonto...they become close, maybe even save each other's lives a few times, etc. Maybe they even have a few smaller encounters like saving a family from a burning house, or thwarting a robbery, this spreading this undercurrent around the land of a masked man of justice and his mysterious sidekick, all leading up to the embracing of the Ranger, a little Texas justice, and avenging the dead brother.

No kidding, ""The Long Ranger"" probably has the most exciting 15 minutes of film since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and it doesn't pretend to be an art film--it's just entertainment. Johnny Depp was absolutely hilarious as Tonto: he should have gotten an Academy Award. And Armie Hammer's take on the Lone Ranger was spot on--just the right amount of naivete mixed with derring-do. I've watched this film three times and after watching it today (got sucked in--didn't intend to, but I was going through my DVD collection and thought, ""Hmmmm"") I'm convinced that critics are insane. Toward the end, when the William Tell Overture starts--to let you know that something big is about to happen--something big HAPPENS. I don't know... Maybe because I grew up watching the old Lone Ranger TV show (which sucked)... but this is one of the best Action films I've seen in quite a while.

Armie Hammer was excellent as The Lone Ranger - the seemingly only bastion of decency and honesty in the Old West. Filmed in magnificent John Ford country - no totally indoor sets for this movie!! Which this story really could not have been told well without it being on location. The little spoiler comes next so stop reading if you don't want to read it. Excellent decision by Verbinski to really racket the action up at the exact point the audience hears ""The Lone Ranger"" song for the first time in the movie. From there on out it's a wild ride!!

209,Amadio,The too long ranger,4,21 August 2013,"Any movie (or other media) that relies on prior knowledge for full enjoyment obviously lacks originality. So is this a 'tribute movie', a TV-screen-to-big-screen adaptation, or a film by a bunch of guys in their 60s who had nothing better to do? For me, it certainly seems like the last option. The whole film is too long, and the basic plot is so transparent that it becomes obvious from close to the beginning what the film is all about. Add to that the hero cannot die, bad guys are bound to get their comeuppance eventually, and painfully slow dialogue masquerading (see what I did there?) as meaningful you are presented with 2 hours and 20 minutes of yawn interspersed with mildly amusing moments. This is not a kid's film, the violence is rather nasty in places. This is not an adult film as the story is predictable and dull. I guess it is aimed at 14-18-year-olds, which is a somewhat narrow demographic. Hence the lack of box-office success? With Depp as a main character, the movie often came across as Pirates of the Nevada. Alright, but rather past its day now. Hammer as the eponymous ranger was fine - for the limited character he was allowed to play. The others? Simple caricatures; scheming railroad baron, evil baddie, feisty yet attractive and vulnerable love interest girl. And H B Carter? What was she doing in that film? Just shoehorned in for another bit of 'authenticity'. This film does not even feel like a Western, it feels like every other Hollywood movie these days. Good guy, faces difficulties, has setbacks, overcomes them, rides off into the sunset for as many sequels as we can squeeze out. When the 'Lone Ranger Rides Again' comes out, save your pennies and read a book instead. For this iteration of Hollywood 'inventiveness' only watch it if you are trapped in a log-cabin all winter.",The Lone Ranger

Of course much is unbelievable, but in the same way the Indiana Jones movies were, and we loved them.At the same time, we get a little education about how Native Americans and the Chinese were used and abused by our ancestors as they carved out the West.Depp and Hammer make a great team.

The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a man named John Reid becomes the Lone Ranger who is brilliantly played by Armie Hammer. Johnny Depp obviously stole the show for his portrayal of Tonto; I thought it was one of his best characters he's ever played. The highlight here is the two's chemistry throughout the film, these are two very different people who both have different perspectives on life and they were just hilarious together. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, I thought some characters were a little under developed and not as enjoyable as the leads. I wished the villain were just as enjoyable like how Geoffrey Rush was for Curse of the Black Pearl. So in other terms the film is not as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but more superior then the Prate sequels.

212,GeorgeSickler,Tonto should have worn a turkey on his head,5,25 August 2013,"I'm afraid I gave up on this one early. I grew up in Texas in the 1950s, with a Roy Rogers bedspread, a Hopalong Cassidy cowboy outfit, a Mattel ""Fanner Fifty"" cap gun six-shooter, the works. Plus watching the Lone Ranger on TV every week, and reading just about every Lone Ranger kid book.So, of course, comparisons are to be made.Without even commenting on the grossly overuse of special effects just for the sake of special effects, I don't think the following are really spoilers because they're in the promos shown on TV. But I checked the warning, anyway.As a kid, I can't recall how many times the TV Lone Ranger sat at a campfire (having coffee) outside of town in the daytime, while Tonto got the lay of the land and reported back.Seems to me if this Tonto did the same thing and entered town with a dead bird on his head and wearing war paint, even the cute new school ma'rm would get a gun and shoot him on sight -- for the safety of the children. So would the town drunk, the mayor, the saloon keeper, etc.And here's the Lone Ranger, wearing a mask and a white hat and outfit, going around the countryside -- but he's wearing a Texas Ranger badge! But he's supposed to be dead. If I were the colonel of the Texas Rangers and knew the headcount, this guy is one Ranger too many. This guy is wearing a mask and impersonating a Texas Ranger! If I were the colonel, I'd put this masked man on my ""most wanted list"" and order the Rangers to hunt him down, dead or alive -- as they really did back then.I don't have a clue what the writers, producers, director were thinking of, but I think they all had one tequila too many.",The Lone Ranger
213,LordJiggy,It's a Master's Thesis,4,4 October 2013,"In how to really screw up a fun movie with padding and really tired, clichéd, and just lazy PC nonsense.The first 40 minutes or so my wife and were really enjoying the film. Yeah, Depp was goofy and they made Armie Hammer kind of a doofus. Fine, they were going for a more light-hearted presentation, in some places almost Looney Tunes kind of experience with gravity and defying the laws of physics (especially with the horse...he and Depp had some great scenes together).But then about an hour in, things began to grind to a halt. It started small, with the Christians in the town drumming up a torch-lit raid on the brothel. Then we get the railroad folks who are exploiting (quelle surprise!) the working people and who (extra shocking surprise!) are actually trying to chase the peaceful Indians off their land. The shock and awe was complete with the appearance of George Armstrong Custer look-alike, and we all know where that leads.After that, it was a painful slog through one absolutely unexpected cliché after another. There were occasional bright moments from Depp, but Hammer's Lone Ranger character was just an idiot. Hard to root for an idiot, although he must have something going on, because the Lone Ranger was magically able to use his whip and shoot with great accuracy, when he had been basically a doofus the entire film.Sigh. This is a more disappointing film than something clearly inept and made by drunken lemurs. With a garbage film, you know what you're getting. The Lone Ranger had a pedigree, it had a heritage and a history (both in terms of the current filmmakers and the mythos of the story itself), but somehow the drunken lemurs took over and turned this movie into garbage, too.",The Lone Ranger
214,Brownsbros3,The critics were right this time,1,22 December 2013,"Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels are rolling over in their graves after this awful modern re-telling of their classic TV series. Normally, I don't agree very much with movie critics on what is good and what is bad, but this time they got it right. This movie stunk from start to finish. Let's start with the casting. Johnny Depp was the wrong guy for Tonto, and nobody knows who Armie Hammer is. In this movie, that had Hammer play John Reid/the Lone Ranger as a buffoon, and very naive about the ways of the west. Tonto has to show him how to do everything. The Lone Ranger should be the lead guy not Tonto. However, by casting Depp as Tonto, you know he's not doing a movie these days to be a supporting player.Also when they created the series for radio and TV back in the 40's and 50's, they had a set code of things that the Lone Ranger and Tonto wouldn't do. As a fan of the original series, I think they should have honored that. This includes no killing, no drinking, the Lone Ranger is never seen without his mask, and they are always on the side of the law. Here Tonto drinks, hangs out at a brothel, and attempts to steal items off of the dead Texas Rangers. They also have different times where they are fighting each other more than the bad guys, and the Lone Ranger and Tonto should never fight each other. They were best friends. Other characters were also constantly making fun of him for wearing the mask. Plus there were too many attempts at lame comedy. They also said about being outlaws, but the Lone Ranger and Tonto were never outlaws. They would sometimes be mistaken for outlaws, but they were always on the side of law and order. I can definitely see why this movie will go down as one of the all time biggest box office bombs.",The Lone Ranger
215,JamesMitchell451,Disney tries to recreate Pirates of the Caribbean's success... to no avail,5,12 August 2013,"This just proves that Disney will stop at nothing when it comes to trying to recreate that Pirates of the Caribbean box office success. Problem is: They keep failing. From producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski, the filmmaking team behind the blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, comes Disney/ Jerry Bruckheimer Films' ""The Lone Ranger,"" a thrilling adventure infused with action and humor, in which the famed masked hero is brought to life through new eyes. Native American spirit warrior Tonto (Johnny Depp) recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid (Armie Hammer), a man of the law, into a legend of justice- taking the audience on a runaway train of epic surprises and humorous friction as the two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption. (Disney) The Lone Ranger has some fun action scenes: mainly in the beginning and the end. The action for the most part is well done. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp do good in their roles, and that's about it. There are many problems with the Lone Ranger, but here is the quick version: The script is awful, truly awful. I'm talking ""Transformers- esqe"" level of sloppy writing. They bring up about 10 different side- plots, and those all lead to nowhere. And the editor should be fired: 2 and a half hours!!!! TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!!!!! Jesus Christ. And about 1 hour and 50 minutes of it are so boring, I'm shocked I didn't fall asleep. The jokes are unfunny, and come in at awkward times. And the acting from everyone else other than the main leads are awful deadpan performances. The Lone Ranger tries to be Pirates of the Caribbean for Westerns. Yet it fails in every regard. Now to be clear: I didn't hate the movie (Though the rest of the world apparently does), and there are far worse movies I have seen this summer (Grown Ups 2, After Earth). But guys let's honest: Who was this movie made for? Not for kids, they have no clue who the Lone Ranger is. Not for older people since they are supposed to have higher standards and since it is so boring. Is it for monkeys? Seems like the Lone Ranger is doomed to fail when it comes to films. There were two Lone Ranger movies before I think. Never heard of them? There is a reason for that. I do enjoy how bad this movie is performing at the box office however, it is hysterical.I also love it that the cast is blaming the critics for this flopping, which is incredibly stupid and immature.",The Lone Ranger
216,janus-20,"Disney may have lost some money, but the critics have lost all credibility.",8,11 August 2013,"I will start by saying that I do not like the Pirates films and I find Johnny Depp's character in those movies deeply disagreeable, just a personal opinion.It probably and understandably seems strange then that I would be moved this past Sunday morn to go and watch the same star and director responsible for those other projects, tackle the Lone Ranger.Considering, as well, the film has flopped stateside and the critics have lassoed it and dragged it through a cactus patch. But I am a fan of the Lone Ranger, have been since I was little, so I thought I'd give it a go.Well I'm glad I did, this was a fantastic film, exciting, well paced (maybe dips a little in the centre), funny, warm and is gorgeous to look at. The scenery (some of which was Utah I believe) was beautiful, featuring fantastic, real world locations, that genuinely brought the film to life.Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp have a good on screen chemistry and Depp's Tonto was amusing, without overkill.Absolute Ranger purists could probably find niggles, but this is entertainment, not historical documentation. They could probably stand to lose the Horse up the tree, in the hat, but I digress. Best of all, I thought, they crank up the William Tell overture, at just the right bit, I left the cinema whistling that tune and feeling that my seven pounds and eighty pence had been judiciously invested.The only cloud on the horizon, was the sudden realisation that most of the negative reviews I had read, by the aforementioned ""critics"", were clearly falderal. Pompous zealots, with axes to grind, so large, that not even Tonto could hurl them. I don't believe that critics opinions, positive or negative, can ultimately hurt the financial performance of a movie.But the real shame here, is that there will be, some good people, somewhere, who will have been dissuaded from catching this film, by that ill-deserved, myopic, rhetoric and their loss, is part of someone else's agenda.So you know what I say, stuff em, go and watch this, if for no other reason, than just to spite our friends the ""critics"" and with that said, its hi yo Silver..AWAY!",The Lone Ranger
217,haosstoposto,Could have been better,5,23 January 2014,"It is a solid movie entertainment marred by obvious influence of Jerry Bruckheimer, who was the producer. He could not bring himself to make a movie without action-superhero-sequences. The story itself is well known, so I will not elaborate it in detail, but there are some illogical moments in the movie which spoiled – at least for me – the viewing. For example when our heroes jump from extreme heights without being hurt. It happen in the beginning when we have John and Tonto on the roof of a derailed train. I wondered how will they save themselves and the solution was appalling, they just waited the train to crash and fling them into the air dozens of meter. They landed without a scratch. Then, near the of the movie we see Tonto jump from a moving train onto another moving train whereby he lands on heap of silver ore, again without being hurt. Another stupid battle was with a soldier firing his Gatling gun. Lone ranger uses his lasso to divert the gun and the poor soldier just keeps on turning the winch of the gun and keeps firing all around, although he could just stop anytime. What happened? Simple enough, bad script writing. All in all, probably a missed chance, but who cares nowadays?",The Lone Ranger
218,uroshnor54,Pretty Good,7,16 August 2014,"I saw The Lone Ranger last year when it was in theaters. I think I would have given it a 9 or maybe even a 10 then. But I recently watched it on Blu-ray and I didn't think it was as good as I thought it was back then. I think I should say that I have not listened to any episodes of The Lone Ranger radio program and I only watched a few episodes of the T.V. show a while before watching the movie on Blu-ray.I thought the framing story was unnecessary back then and I still do. The Lone Ranger is also too long and not very well-paced. The action takes a while to get started. There are also some moments that are so strange that they're kind of distracting, like the carnivorous rabbits (and yes, I know that there are some species of rabbits that are carnivorous but they were still weird) and the part where John Reid wakes up on a wooden structure on a cliff, a scene which seemed to be shot just so it could be included in the trailer. I also didn't like how the Lone Ranger's catchphrase (""Hi-Yo Silver! Away!"") was said just to be made fun of.The Lone Ranger was still a fun movie, though. The story is engaging. I cared about the protagonists and I did want to see the villains defeated. The action, when it happens, is good. The finale is great. Hans Zimmer's score is also pretty good. It kind of reminded me of Ennio Morricone's score for Once Upon a Time in the West.So The Lone Ranger was an enjoyable, if not perfect, movie. It's too bad it didn't do very well at the box office. I'd much rather see a sequel to The Lone Ranger than any of those superhero movies that are all the rage these days.",The Lone Ranger
219,jjgooner,A Fun Thrill-Ride,7,16 August 2013,"The Lone Ranger***(out of 4)149 mins/ 12Cast: Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer, William Fichtner, Tom Wilkinson, Ruth Wilson, Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale, Bryant Prince, Leon RippyDirector: Gore VerbinskiPlot: Native American Tonto, tells the legend of John Reid – the lone ranger. JJ's Verdict: From the producers, director, writer and star of Pirates of the Caribbean, it's impossible to avoid comparing it to the Lone Ranger. And, given that it is one of the most successful franchises ever, this film retains three things that audiences loved about Pirates. It looks good (like Pirates it is sometimes hard to see the CGI even if you know it is there), boasts Johnny Depp as its standout performer, and keeps that over-the-top fun that audiences love and welcome with open arms. It is just a shame then, that it's characters are undeveloped and underwritten and its plot is uneven and predictable. The Lone Ranger is told in flashback by Native American Tonto while he is working at a Wild West funfair in 1933. His story dates back to 1869 where he teams up with John Reid, a mysterious lawman turned outlaw who 'has been to the other side' (i.e. escaped death.) The story follows the pair as Reid seeks justice for his brother's death and Tonto for the destruction of his home village. They then get mixed up in the corruptness of local businessman Cale and notorious fugitive Butch Cavendish as a railway track is being built through the whole of America – but not always fairly.On its release in America, The Lone Ranger bombed at the box office and was mauled by most critics. Many have put this down to a poor marketing campaign and many critics giving negative reviews on the film's production disaster and big budget rather than the film itself. What I like about The Lone Ranger is that at no time does it feel a cheap cash-in on an old legend told many times before. The story although, I must confess, is very predictable seems like it has been well thought through and is full of twists and turns that almost, but not quite, work. There is no cheap CGI at work either, and the whole film looks rather stunning. The cinematography is beautiful and the CGI looks real and it is never obvious whether it is real or not which is something modern cinema sometimes lacks.Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer make a brilliant partnership in this film and seem to have superb chemistry. Depp's slapstick comedy is some of the best that cinema boasts and his ability to take any character and make it his own is just outstanding. Although his bumbling and never too confident take on the character is an entirely new one, Armie Hammer still does a good job of trying to compete with Depp but really he doesn't have a chance. Helena Bonham Carter turns up for a few fun scenes, James Badge Dale gives a bold performance as John's brother and Tom Wilkinson and William Fichtner make one-dimensional but still excellent villains. The film is full of brilliantly over-the-top and fun action pieces with the best taking place on two trains running side by side. In Pirates of the Caribbean, they did have these big set-pieces but always finished on the best and biggest which is something The Lone Ranger lacks. Its finale has a lot of build-up but is resolved all too quickly and has to receive my award for anti-climax of the summer. It's a shame because a big finale really could have made this something special.It is uneven and poorly written but the brilliance of Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski manage to make The Lone Ranger a fun, if slightly halted, thrill-ride.",The Lone Ranger
220,TimMeade,Fails to Match Production Values,5,9 July 2013,"It is now well over 20 years since Kevin Costner reinvigorated the western when he produced and starred in the highly successful Dances with Wolves – it was a major commercial and critical success winning seven Oscars, including Best Picture.One of the main innovations of this film was the portrayal of Native Americans byNative Americans. Many might be surprised that this should ever have been considered so ground-breaking. Following on from this film, it was the received wisdom that never again could Hollywood revert to having Native Americans played by Caucasians. But there are exceptions to most scenarios and when you have the star power of Johnny Depp, such rules can, and will be, cavalierly ignored - though Mr Depp believes he has some Native Americam ancestry somewhere in his past.Unfortunately, Depp follows a distinguished line of actors who come a little unstuck when playing outside their own ethnicity – even Marlon Brando stumbled when playing a Japanese in The Teahouse of the August Moon. (And let's not mention Mickey Rooney as Mr Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany's).Under his heavy face make up and dead crow headpiece, the usually charismatic Depp gives an ambiguous performance as Tonto, the outcast Comanche. At times he is sagacious and taciturn as he evokes the deep spirituality perceived of the Native American. But all too often the characterisation drops and he drifts into the anachronism of present day irony with facetious one-liners and facial expressions to match.The film itself is as equally confused as Depp's ambiguous performance. Its central thrust deals with corrupt and duplicitous railroad executives driving their project through Comanche country, inciting murder and tearing up contracts agreed by the trusting 'Injuns'. However, its mix of light humour juxtaposed with scenes of mass murder, bordering on genocide, sits uncomfortably together – it was never going to mesh. Expecting an audience to laugh at a visual joke immediately after the wiping out of a settlement was always a big ask, though some in the theatre didn't have a problem with it. But for me it jarred. Other jokes simply fell flat, others raised a smile. And this from the team of Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski who collaborated, again with Depp, on the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. This was a film that knew its niche – humorous, tongue in cheek and easy to like.A further distraction is the film being set among the wonderful sandstone buttes of Monument Valley, inviting unfavourable comparison with the superior westerns of John Ford. But as a backdrop, it's just about unbeatable.The titular role of The Lone Ranger (aka John Reid) was always going to be a difficult task, awkward not to be eclipsed by Depp who was both co-producer and top billed. But Depp has generously given Armie Hammer a role larger than I thought may be the case. Sadly, this is not for the better as for the vast majority of the film he plays The Lone Ranger as a sanctimonious prig. When his inevitable transformation comes, it is far too late and equally unconvincing.On the plus side, veteran character actor Tom Wilkinson was value for money playing the Machiavellian railroad boss Latham Cole – Tom knows how to play a villain. And little known British actor Ruth Wilson was outstanding as The Lone Ranger's sister in law, Rebecca, playing a frontierswoman with a stoic feistiness – I hope Amy Adams was watching and takes notes for when she reprises the role of Lois Lane in the next Superman movie.The film is an unashamed blockbuster and it has some great set-piece action pieces with probably the best 'train falling off a bridge' scene since The Bridge on the River Kwai. But at nearly two and a half hours duration, it is rather slow in places; much judicious editing was required.The production values of the film can't be faulted and the sets are wonderful. It's just a shame that they're wasted on such an indifferent film.",The Lone Ranger
221,i_ianchev,Pirates of the Caribbean in the Wild west,7,11 July 2013,"As I think of it now we were expecting exactly that - a humorous wild west epic adventure with fantastic elements. And still I wasn't expecting so much entertaining film. Although this kind of a movie is not my taste, I must admit - it is fulfilling almost every aspect of a modern movie. The story might be noting special, some key moments might be taken from classic western movies, we've seen Depp as a comic hero with lots of make-up, and we know that there will be lots of special effects and good music. But still at the movie theater I was entertained very much. There was almost not plot hole and no cinematographic mistake. Well, maybe the main hero Kemosabe was a bit too indecisive and some of the second-hand characters didn't have depth, but what the hell - this is a Disney movie targeted at the wide audience. Maybe I needed a fresh story from the Wild west (although the origin of The Lone Ranger dates way back to the 1930s), or maybe the movie is really good, but I think that this is one of the best Johnny Depp films I've watched. And the funny catchphrases, silver bullets and the William Tell Overture are only spices which enhance the great visual content created by Disney. I may not be a fan of The Lone Ranger or its sort, but I recommend it without a doubt in my mind. It is a 2 and half an hour piece of movie magic, created with money and some imagination taken out of the American showbiz sleeve. And that's a compliment considering that in the recent years the masses spend their money to films which are much less creative in so many ways.",The Lone Ranger
222,pinkled5,Opening scene a metaphor for rest of movie,2,18 July 2013,"This movie opens with a colossal train wreck which serves as a metaphor for the rest of the film. I actually had no intention of seeing this but a family member told me it was great. So I rushed to the theater after work, spent $17 on tickets and concessions and then sat there bored out of my mind. Nothing in this movie worked. The action scenes were ridiculous, the humor was lame, the characters were flat and the plot was uninteresting.In addition to that, I felt the movie was too violent for younger children so it disenfranchises a large swath of its target audience as a result.Do yourself a favor and plan on missing this one.",The Lone Ranger
223,dreamdemon-1,It's a fun ride with low expectations,10,8 July 2013,"The movie is exactly what it sets out to be: an outrageous comedy that lampoons the Wild West myths. It's an all around parody that doesn't have the slightest intention to revive Westerns and it's an outstanding one at that, mostly because there aren't really that many around.For a long time I felt that the Western genre has been placed on an honor pedestal, like some intangible (even taboo) that lived its life on the screen and then was allowed to rest in peace.Well, ""The Lone Ranger"" picks up every stereotype, wraps it in slapstick comedy, sticks it on an outrageous story where the cherry on top is represented by the iconic characters of Tonto and The Lone Ranger.Everything is in there: the noble Indians decimated by the greedy railway builders who exploit Chinese immigrants while dealing with outlaws to do their bidding and, when time allows, raping the mountains of their riches while the natives have no chance against modern weapons.There are no surprises here, the parody is formulaic and Johnny Depp is his quirky self, making his character work.This is no Academy Award movie, just a light comedy that is sure to draw plenty of laughs as long as you take it lightly in a lazy week-end afternoon.",The Lone Ranger
224,jmoney-2,Schizophrenic yet entertaining,6,6 July 2013,"Disney's ""The Lone Ranger"" begins with a train wreck, and the movie miraculously avoids becoming one itself. The big budget update of the Western hero's tale is schizophrenic yet entertaining.Movie screens this summer have been filled with new renditions of iconic characters from classic TV shows. First came Captain Kirk, then Superman. But the latest rebooted figure is far less familiar to moviegoers under the age of 70. The Lone Ranger hasn't saddled-up since a disastrous film adaptation bombed at the box office in 1981. (That movie's star, Klinton Spilsbury, was literally never heard from again.) So, the character's mythology is less familiar, and thus moviegoers will be less bothered by some of the major tweaks to the masked man's origin story.The filmmakers tip us off early that this isn't your father's Lone Ranger by creating a ""Princess Bride""-style frame story: A young Lone Ranger fan in 1933 encounters an elderly Tonto at a carnival (Johnny Depp in remarkable old age makeup) and the Native American purports to tell the child the real story of how he and the Lone Ranger met.The most prominent (and sociologically welcome) change is Tonto himself. Depp's version is no subordinate sidekick. He's a bad-ass warrior who would have no trouble taking care of the bad guys single-handedly.In this version, John Reid (played by Armie Hammer) does not start out as a Texas Ranger. Instead, when we first meet him, he's an idealistic big city lawyer. It's a notable change, but one that explains his inherent sense of justice and instantly makes him much more relatable. He's a regular guy who answers the call to become a hero.Reid travels west to take a job as a prosecutor, but when nefarious outlaw Butch Cavendish escapes a date with the hangman, Reid is deputized and rides with a posse of Rangers – including his brother -- to hunt Cavendish down. When Cavendish's gang ambushes the Reid brothers, John Reid is the sole survivor. Tonto – who has his own history with Cavendish -- finds Reid and suggests he take on the persona of a masked vigilante as the pair reluctantly team-up to go after the baddie. In this telling, Tonto is the alpha male and the Lone Ranger is (at least in the beginning) his bumbling, naive acolyte. At times, even the Ranger's white horse, Silver, seems smarter than the man in the white hat.There are some clever winks and nods to the more hokey elements of the Lone Ranger Legend. This time around, no one asks, ""Who was that masked man?"" Instead, the constant query is, ""What's with the mask?"" But Director Gore Verbinski and his triumvirate of screenwriters can't seem to decide if they're making a tongue-in-cheek parody or a straightforward Western. The film alternates between scenes of gruesome (albeit not visually gory) cannibalism and silly poop jokes. Most of the comedy involves Depp and at times it seems like the star is acting in an entirely different movie. Given the inherent ludicrousness of the concept, making a full-on action comedy would have been wiser. But the funny parts are funny enough that I forgave the movie's split personality.The script uses a sprinkling of non-linear storytelling to try and fake out the audience here and there. For the most part, however, the movie telegraphs its punches. Fortunately those punches make a pretty good impact when they land. The set pieces are great and the William Tell Overture plays on the soundtrack at just the right time. The finale is enormously satisfying and, best of all, the movie remains true to the spirit of the Lone Ranger. If you can forgive inconsistencies in tone, you'll have a good time.",The Lone Ranger
225,cornflakeboy20,200 million dollar boondoggle,4,13 July 2014,"Like many of Disney's recent megaflops, this is creakily old fashioned in the worst possible way. The tone - varying between screwball comedy and high body count violence - is so uneven it's bipolar. Johnny Depp is phoning it in with a Willie Wonka-esque performance, all funny faces and gestures like a talking mime. Armie Hammer looks homely and ten years older than he is; they may as well have cast Cary Elwes. The only thing possible that I think the producers/director were going for was along the lines of the more current Indiana Jones films. They didn't even hit the artistry of Crystal Skull. Some of the effects, shots and scenery are great, which is a shame because if they'd told a good story, they could have halved the budget and doubled the gross.",The Lone Ranger

Because of work and travel I had t watch it over a few attempts so I guess the good thing about it is that it's not a complicated story line that couldn't be followed even over a few sittings.Not sure about the genre- it had its funny moments, it had good action scenes. Probably a good mix overall which kept it interesting.The special effects were great.However the realism of some of the scenes was out of whack. I mean who can survive being thrown from a high speed train, onto gravel and rocks and then get pelted with debris and have nothing more that a few cuts and marks? No gravel rash, no broken bones, no skin peeled off! Seriously?Still a good movie though, I think....",The Lone Ranger
227,davish_wulf-1,Coul be so much better,6,23 February 2019,"The Lone Ranger is the equivalent of Zorro, but on western style.
It's a mystic character, upholding justice at all times, always followed by his loyal companion Tonto.
Now I understand that Verbinski has a thing for Depp since the Pirates series, the humor is there, the action scenes, silliness and this is almost like a Pirates of the Caribbean in western style.
What I don't understand is how the Lone Ranger character is so limited in action an will, a clumsy almost secondary character without charisma, lacking courage and playing the clown the whole moving along.
Before his unfortunate incident, I could buy that he would be a normal man, with fears, not believing in violence, shy, clumsy and all of that. But after he is reborn, after he's the chosen one, why the hell is he so clumsy, shy and lacking charisma at all, not even evolving towards that?
It's like Tonto got all the credit and Tonto shouldn't even be the main character here, instead of the Ranger.
Is the Lone Ranger the equivalent of a drunken Jack on the Pirates series? But without his charisma? Or is Tonto the equivalent of Jack?
The comparison is unavoidable with Verbinski past works.
By no means it's a bad movie, it is fun, action paced, beautiful landscapes and filmography, but could be much better if more importance was given to the Lone Ranger, if the focus of the main character was him instead of Tonto (or balanced at least) and cleverly juggling from comic moments and acts of bravery.
Perhaps Gore had intended it to have a sequel, as it is, this was not worth a sequel, but is a good comic movie overall, with some strong moments to be reviewed, not to be taken too seriously.
Good movie, worth a watch, but could have been so much better.",The Lone Ranger
228,stephenrtod,"Send-up, parody, non-kids movie, way too long, with way too many plot threads",4,7 July 2013,"I enjoyed listening to Brace Beemer create The Lone Ranger with his voice alone on the radio, and our entire family gathered around the television in the 1950s to relish the attributes of a masked man who was extremely humble and modest as well as very restrained, deploring any semblance of ungentlemanly behavior.Both those artistic ventures were totally family-friendly: no off color language, nudity, sex or much more violence than a very tacit gun shot or sock in the chin.Gore Verbinksi's new ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto"" is an important document, because it revives a mythical American icon that many generations are unfamiliar with, but this is not a movie one could take the wife and kiddies to see.Verbinski was at the directorial helm in all four of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, and I must confess I cannot watch much of that cinematic footage, which seems to presuppose that most audiences demand incessant sensory stimulation. ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto"" is cut right out of the type of story called ODTAA (One darned thing after another). The film is too long and too cluttered.It took far too long to establish the working team of Tonto and Lone Ranger, perhaps because a slew of extraneous nuances and devices, not in the original tale, had to be tucked neatly into celluloid first.The framing device of a 1933 waxed version of Tonto repeatedly coming alive as a sort of theatrical hustle was diverting the first time, but used over and over again, it became tiresome, annoying and ineffective.Armie Hammer has Clayton Moore's demeanor, his enunciation and cadence down pat. Lightly lampooning the classic image of The Lone Ranger was probably long overdue although Mad Magazine did it decades ago perfectly.Like ""Man of Steel,"" another fascinating but flawed film of summer 2012, this film deserves a sequel if only to rectify its mistakes, but that venture should not exceed, say, one hour and forty-one minutes. Tight. No loose ends. Every element contributing to a single effect.This movie tried to be too many things: (a) both a send-up and a a parody of a great western legend (b) an over-the-top rollicking comedy (c) at times, very close to straight drama (d) farce mixed with outlandish comedy (3) tragedy (when the Native Americans are being slaughtered.I'm trying to think of the sort of audience the director, the producer and the cast had aimed this movie. Definitely not a kids movie. We started watching with a nine year old, a 12 year old and a 17 year old. All of them quickly lost interest. Maybe very jaded or drunken or high 18-35 year olds if they are extremely immature.Yet, this movie was very carefully choreographed. Were I an instructor of film technique, I would use this vehicle as an illustration of what not to do. Definitely jettison the carnivorous rabbits. Shorten it to an hour and forty minutes, maximum, or a two parter, or maybe a made-for-television-two part movie.Tom Wilkinson, one of the most talented character actors in Hollywood alive today, an artist who can enliven even a mediocre movie, was wasted in this movie.I thought that everyone in the world agreed after watching ""Temple of Doom"" that eating someone's heart on screen was not enthralling theatrically. And lose the carnivorous rabbits.",The Lone Ranger
229,jan_kalina,A lawyer and a crazy Indian!,10,31 December 2013,"Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer present the unlikeliest duo ever to hit the big screen. And they couldn't have done it better. Verbinski being my favorite director of all time, hasn't disappointed me yet. What I admire about his films is the way he can transform all these absurdities that take place in his films but in his films they don't seem odd or strange, you naturally take them as a part of the world the films takes place.The Lone Ranger is a film for every western fan out there. This films is like the best of the western films. It blends all the particular types of the western genre into one. It doesn't pull any punches though, it is the dirty and gritty western I have asked for but is is also the action/adventure film I have come to expect from Verbinski. I understand some issues why this film has not been accepted by the American audience very well. It was released into theaters on the Independence Day and during this holiday Americans expect a patriotic film. This is probably the least patriotic film I have seen to be released on the Independence Day. It shows the true side of the history USA has been built upon (the Indian massacre, slaves building the railroad) and sometimes this fact has to be bashed into their heads so they would remember it. Another issue people address about this film is that it is starring Johnny Depp, an actor who is repeating his tricks, who does the same routine - according to the audiences worldwide. They also claim that he repeats his Jack Sparrow persona in this film. This could not be further from truth. Depp creates a whole new character, who is in no way a disgrace to the Indians. His character Tonto also serves as the narrator of this story and because he's an old man when he is telling this story, he can't remember all the details which makes this unreliable narrator an excuse for some plot points or some logical flaws such as the horse who can fly, how did some characters escaped form jail etc. Since Tonto is an Indian his English is very broken, therefore he stays silent in some scenes even giving the impression of an Buster Keaton like character. Armie Hammer has surprisingly proved himself as an excellent leading man. Hs character is charming, but also goofy. He is the perfect naive lawyer who sees that sometimes justice can't be done at a court, sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. William Fichtner is clearly enjoying his role of Butch Cavendish, the sleazy merciless villain of this film, thus proving himself once again as an great actor of small roles.The Walt Disney Stuios have a problem with marketing their live-action films. It started with Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, continued with Tron:Legacy and escalated with John Carter and now with the Lone Ranger. These films didn't attract enough people to go and pay to see these films because the trailers weren't showing the true nature of the film. The Lone ranger was presented as an CGI mess and an heavy Depp/Bonham Carter collaboration which it isn't. Most of the film's effects was made with practical effects with a minimal help of computer effects and Helena Bonham Carter appears in the film in two scenes only. I also don't understand why the William Tell Overture which is being considered as The Lone Ranger Theme wasn't used in the marketing. In the film when the William Tell Overture starts to play, you know that is the most fun you'll have this summer in the cinema. The train chase in this film is the craziest chase since the Wrong Trousers with Wallace and Gromit.Is this an Disney film you ask? Yes, it is, but in a similar way as The Pirates of the Caribbean became darker, more absurd and more morbid in humor this is the same case because this is Gore Verbinski's style. The Lone Ranger is in tone closer to his previous feature Rango, which also was an tribute to westerns. So in my opinion this is an amazingly fun action/adventure western film but it is not forgetting its western roots therefore being too dark film for a Disney family audience, which might have taken some people by surprise. The Lone Ranger is an under-appreciated masterpiece just as any other film from Gore Verbinski. Just as Jerry Bruckheimer predicts this film will be rediscovered as a masterpiece just as other classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey or The Wizard of OZ. I for sure will be first in line to support the greatness of this film.",The Lone Ranger

It was a bit too long at 149 minutes, but I can't think of where it could be cut. Every scene advanced the plot and choppiness would have been introduced if the film was shorter. The Lone Ranger is full of action scenes that are superbly crafted, though a few seemed a bit contrived or campy. The dialog has plenty of witticisms, most by Depp and many about Silver, the horse. The trailers would lead you to believe that Depp's Tonto is the main character, but Hammer gives a fine performance and the movie is well balanced in presenting the two main characters. William Fitchner (The Perfect Storm) gives a good performance as a very hatable villain. This is a popcorn and candy move well suited for the summer. Give it a try.",The Lone Ranger
231,politicidal,POTC this ain't. Disney's blockbuster formula has run its course with TLR and the results are disappointing..,5,1 January 2015,"The Lone Ranger is nowhere near as terrible as some reviews implied it being but it is also nowhere CLOSE as good as it SHOULD be. This film had the same director from POTC, the same producer from POTC, the same writing duo from POTC, and yes the same exact A-list actor from the POTC franchise. They even kept the same bloody composer for the musical score. Yet this movie is an absolute disappointment as both a western and a blockbuster which I'm sure Disney hoped it'd be. I'll admit that the trailers made this movie look better than I thought it would be. So naturally I was amazed by the bad reviews it got from critics. Are they too harsh? Yes but they're correct in stating it's not a good film. It's not bad either but it is simply mediocre which is in some respects more insulting to viewers curious enough to watch it. The production values look fantastic which is no surprise. This movie cost 215 million dollars and better look like it so it does. The 30 minute climax on two (not one TWO) runaway trains is admittedly among the most flat-out entertaining finales I've seen in a blockbuster. But it takes you two whole hours to get to this point and it's not worth it. The character development is slow to non-existent, the jokes range from slapstick to poop jokes and mostly fall flat. What is so strange about this movie is the massively uneven tone. It has comedy in it but so many dark elements. The violence is even stronger than in POTC and some R-rated movies. There's two brutal massacre scenes of Indians and a part where someone's heart is ripped out and eaten. This is a Disney film meant for families with kids? And the acting is not much to keep your interest. Johnny Depp is channeling Jack Sparrow AGAIN and poor Armie Hammer is given a poorly written protagonist that's a bumbling fool. So this is what 215 million dollars is spent at Disney these days? I'm not impressed.",The Lone Ranger

233,amit_imt2002,A big boring film!,4,5 July 2013,"Johnny Depp directed a film once.It was called The Brave and co-starred Marlon Brando along with Depp who played an impoverished American Indian, who agrees to make a snuff movie in exchange for money which will help his family.The film was never theatrically released but showed Mr. Depps commitment and love for the native American.He also claims some Cherokee roots on his great-grandmother side and its not difficult to imagine him gleefully take up the offer to play Tonto for his long-term Pirates franchise collaborator Gore Verbinksi. What Mr Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer were thinking is more intriguing though. As they plod along with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise they are in search of a new one for Disney.The Masked Man is the property they dug up, one that few cares about, which of course they planned to change.Since they have made big films which have mountains of money they could get the green light and 250 million USD for this project.What we have is a full-fledged assault of special effects and elaborate set pieces that are only faintly amusing and that too fleetingly.I admit to being a Depp fan, he has built up a solid repertoire of off beat and sometimes downright quirky roles and his work with Tim Burton has always been a refreshing ride of wild creativity.Speaking of creativity this very director was positively brilliant in his last outing with Rango which was a near perfect animated film.Here Armie Hammer plays John Reid, a very idealistic county prosecutor who in the outlandish but breathtaking opening sequence on a train, gets caught up in a jailbreak by gunslinger Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and rogue Comanche Indian Tonto (Johnny Depp) while returning from the city. Tonto and Reid team up to hunt down Butch and his gang through the desert with Tonto having his own agenda of avenging the wrongs done to his tribe.The film uses a 1933 carnival exhibition in San Francisco as its framing device, where a young Lone Ranger fan encounters an ancient, nearly 100-year-old Tonto, now reduced to a sideshow freak.As Tonto recounts his tale to the boy, the film cuts back to his narration every 30 minutes or so, which does not help its comic action adventure tone or pacing at all.That Tonto is quite an eccentric should be a good thing and excuse for some really charming comedy but his antics with the dead bird on his head only make this movie more preposterous.At times, The Lone Ranger wants to be a tongue in cheek spoof on of the old TV series but muddies the waters with very macabre scenes (testing the limits of its PG13 rating) where Butch carves out and eats the heart of a victim or when Indians are massacred by U.S. soldiers brutally with a machine gun.Arnie Hammer has the right look and charisma to play The Lone Ranger but by the time he makes up his mind to become the title character our interest in the film has been long dead .When he arrives at the ""Hi -yo Silver"" moment near the end of the film its a bit too late.Mr Depps performance as a very sober and mellow version of captain Jack Sparrow with an oversized burnt bird for headgear, which he keeps trying to feed seeds he digs up, is a bundle of contradictions.Surely the incoherence of his character owes more to the screenplay than to his acting skills.Sitting through this movie you can quietly contemplate all the existential questions that may be haunting you or you can down a few thousand calories worth of popcorn and soda but all that glucose will not set your pulse racing.This film proves how big paychecks are creating films that force very talented people to make films like this which reduce movie watching to a chore.Some movie messes are tasty like chop suey but this one is concocted from very expensive but stale ingredients.I am betting grossing 500 million USD which this film needs to just break even will be a very uphill task.Published on mostlycinema.com",The Lone Ranger
234,interestingfunstuff,We Get To See A Nation of Thieves At Work!,10,6 July 2013,"While the Lone Ranger succeeds in maintaining a great sense of humor throughout, and never takes it's self too seriously, this film is still able to convey some incredibly powerful messages that need to resonate with more people.This brilliant story makes it clear as crystal: the Crimes Against Humanity, otherwise known as acts of genocide, committed in the 19th century in the name of ""Progress"" and ""Greed and/or Capitalism"" continues to benefit all non-American Indians to this very day! It was a shocking revelation! I never thought of this legacy of undeserved benefit at the cost of countless innocent lives had anything to do with me! Our ancestors were a nation of thieves! Hello! Most Americans are descended From European cultures that practically worship property rights and most of us still do! Yet our ancestors would kill entire villages of native people without a second thought in order to steal their land and/or their natural resources! All because they knew they could get away with their crimes without ever being held the least bit accountable by anyone! There's several episodes of intense violence in the Lone Ranger that made me feel like bolting out the theater door! I have extensive knowledge of American history and the historically accurate violence shown in this film caught me totally off-guard! (See: North American Indian Timeline, 1492-1999 from thelatinlibraryorg) What makes matters even more painful is that in various parts of the world the killing of native peoples in order to steal their land and/or natural resources is still going on today! Yes! Today! (Visit: Survival International, headquartered in London, England with a chapter in San Fransisco; and Cultural Survival located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.)This story is really about Tonto and his people the Comanche, not the Lone Ranger! Without Tonto, the Lone Ranger would have remained an easily deceived, bumbling fool!

235,cliffvose,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,2,11 August 2013,"It is difficult to discern whether the sets where actually built for this film or whether the director just took his crew out into the streets of a provincial town for the day. With hardly any coherent plot other than the same old 'truth, justice and the American way' scenario it is not difficult to understand why this film bombed at the box- office. Johnny Depp turns in his tried and trusted weirdo/rock star performance rolls his eyes a lot and does fair impersonations of past film actors including a remarkable Edward Fox impersonation, as the unlikely duo await entrance to the 'house of sin' presided over by Helena Bonham Carter who is indistinguishable from most of her other roles (and who obviously retains the same wardrobe company and hairdresser) except for the ivory leg and push-up bra and whisky voice-trained basso profondo growl. Quite why she keeps her gun inside her ivory leg is never explained.Johnny Depp is not bad as an actor but perhaps he could occasionally view his own performances so as to modify his stereotypical performances and save his public from the tedium of trying to remember in what film we last saw his current caricature.The humour in the film largely derives from a mix of contemporary frustrations (health and safety and gay stereotypes) overlaid on the 1880's American 'Wild' West era. The 'feisty lady/widow' character is played by Helen Wilson on a day off from the beauty salon in downtown L.A. Who along with her faithful 'ranch hand' (the actor's name doesn't appear on IMDb unless you click on 'full cast') and annoyingly tousled-haired son (who doesn't QUITE get to say: ''Shane ...I love you.'') hold off a gang of murdering perverts until help arrives in the form of Armie Hammer (?).

236,avik-kumar-si,Depp saves the day,5,14 October 2013,"I watched The Lone Ranger on a flight entertainment system on a long flight back home. It is an ideal film for such purposes: passing time and having a few laughs on the way. Some have described the film as ""Jack Sparrow in a Western"". The lazy description, while not inaccurate, does not tell the entire story. No doubt, The Lone Ranger evokes images, situations and the central character of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. However, in its Western setting, Johnny Depp's Tonto is a new character, with a new sidekick. For one, the ""sidekick"" of this story, a lawyer played by Armie Hammer, is a man more self-assured and stronger than Orlando Bloom's Will Turner.The highlights of the film are the comedy-action set pieces with Depp cracking his one-liners on the go and doing his thing. Watching Jack Sparrow reincarnated isn't bad after all, and maybe that is what the commercial think tank had counted upon. The characterization of the anti-hero could use a bit more thinking, but the minor characters – both human and beast – make up partly for the void.To conclude, The Lone Ranger is good entertainment if you have some time to kill. Having said that, it is an unlikely candidate to enter the list of must-watches of this genre.",The Lone Ranger

239,angelicseven,Lead stealer Tonto,4,5 February 2014,"First of all I would not recommend this movie for any Lone Ranger fans as it doesn't compliment it at all. Right off I recognized it as like The Green Hornet (2011) where the lead man is stupid and his side-kick has all the brains & daring guts. It's nothing like the way the original Lone Ranger and Tonto was like. The creators behind it made it into something funny, with ridiculous special effects stunts and so much of what happens doesn't make no sense at all. It also seems like Johnny Depp pretending to be Jackie Chan. About in the middle of the show it felt like a 3 hour movie and finally couldn't wait for it to end. I honestly don't know where people get it was better than the Man Of Steel movie when that has to be better than this. I'm glad I didn't waste going to the theaters to see it.",The Lone Ranger
240,bebop63-1,The Groan Ranger or the Lone Deranger,5,4 September 2013,"Either of the aforementioned titles would have been more appropriate than just The Lone Ranger. Armie Hammer as the titular character does little more than whinge and complain and question about every sticky situation he gets himself into, in conjunction with Tonto (the ""Deranger""), who true to his name, is more loco than an ancient Nordic berserker in his quest to avenge the massacre of his tribe by hunting down the men responsible. In truth, Tonto is the real protagonist, as he does most of the fighting and killing and talking, leaving the real LR little more than a bumbling sidekick. And what's with the dead crow on his head - shouldn't he be affiliated with the Crow tribe in that case instead of Comanche? - at any rate, as far as I can recall from reading countless Western novels, the native tribes usually adorned themselves with the feathers and not the entire bird. I'd like to know what today's Comanche think of about Johnny Depp's portrayal. Wouldn't be surprised if they decided to unite and go on the warpath.Clearly the target audience are the gen-Yers and Z-ers, many of whom will have never heard of nor seen the original TV serial starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. But even the, why distort the original storyline and throw in incongruous special effects that will be disproven by Mythbusters - like a horse leaping from a rooftop to a train over a ten foot distance, and then dropping perfectly straight into a train carriage just before it goes through a tunnel. Not to mention numerous anachronisms in time and history - Sears Roebuck wasn't formed till the early 20th century? And what's with the scorpion-munching rabid rabbits? That said I did have a good laugh throughout the film only because I found 250 million ways to turn a classic Western icon into a comedic travesty.Who was that masked man? Who cares?!",The Lone Ranger
241,CSHaviland,$215 million just doesn't buy what it used to...,6,12 August 2013,"While there has been a lot of hype around The Lone Ranger being a major box office bomb, let's set the facts straight. As of the date of this review, it's made over $87 million. What we saw on screen couldn't have been worth more than $50 million at best, and I'm being polite. Deserts, cowboys on horseback, some trains... We've seen it all before. And it made $87 million. Not bad considering the plotting wasn't great and Tonto being over-baked to a crisp.So why all the hype about it being a bomb? Because the studio proudly reported that they spent $215 million to make this movie.WHAT??? Did they cut a massive special effects extravaganza out of the movie somewhere? How did they manage to spend $215 million on this? Where's the production value? They put a lot of work into the train SFX, especially train crash SFX, but I'm still not seeing $215 million worth. I'm not even seeing $100 million worth. I'm not even seeing $50 million worth.But let's get back to the story.There are two problems with the plotting and characterization of this movie. 1) Tonto is mentally unstable, rather than a loyal and brave guide for The Lone Ranger as he was intended to be. 2) The Lone Ranger didn't seem to have any outstanding skills, and wasn't even very sure of himself or what he should do. I expected them to dial up The Lone Ranger into an Indiana Jones type of character. I wanted to see him as a sharp-shooter who gets knocked down over and over but keeps coming back until he achieves his goal. 3) Silver, the horse, was turned into a sort of semi-mystical spirit creature, apparently capable of doing a few things horses normally can't do. I didn't much like introducing magic into world of The Lone Ranger. Why not throw some aliens in while we're at it? The movie wasn't completely without merit, but all in all, ho hum.And $215 million dollars??",The Lone Ranger

243,sunshinebeachcinema,"A highlight of the summer, capturing the spirit of old Hollywood, and offering fresh interpretation of the characters.",8,1 September 2013,"Ahead of The Lone Ranger as it made its way across the pond was a cloud of overwhelming negativity from American critics, souring the film's UK opening. Stars Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp have defended the film against this tirade, arguing that these reviews were written months before the film was released, and focused on condemning the large budget length. This side of the Atlantic, critical reception has been elevated to ""mixed"". Bracing ourselves for the worst, the revelation is that The Lone Ranger is actually a cracking film, that does not deserve its fate as the latest high profile flop.Yes, the $250 million dollar budget screams extravagance, and the two-and-a-half- hour runtime seems bloated. This is typical of a Hollywood bubble that seems in danger of bursting, as studios continue to green light expensive sequels and reboots that absorb money and frequently fail to make a significant return. The length is not a problem; it remains interesting throughout, and the last sequence is almost a little too action packed.Traditionally, westerns ranked among the cheapest entertainment. This was true during the Lone Ranger's heyday of the 1950s, especially for television. The bare minimum merely required a twenty minute drive to the deserts outside Los Angeles, or if you were willing to spend a few more days on the thing, Arizona's Monument Valley, which appears here in all its cinematic glory.What sets The Lone Ranger apart is that it is seriously old school cinema. The Lone Ranger himself, with his white Stetson, domino mask and strict moral code, is an iconic American character, first appearing in 1930s radio serials, and more famously in the 1950s television series. The latest incarnation is directed by Gore Verbinski, who knows a thing or two about working with Johnny Depp. The man who brought swashbuckling sagas back to our screens is an appropriate choice to resurrect one of the earliest Western heroes.Trailers featured behind the scenes footage, seeking to make us aware that this film eschews total reliance on CGI, instead opting to perform many of the most impressive stunts for real. There are some particularly breathtaking sequences involving trains; the story is set against the backdrop of the transcontinental railway, the completion of which is relocated to reconstruction-era Texas.The film provides compelling back stories and character arcs for both the Lone Ranger and Tonto. From the character's inception, The Lone Ranger was instilled with a strong set of principles, and this is how John Reid, the man who will become the Ranger, starts his journey: as a man of virtue but naivety, who believes in the law, and more importantly, a powerful sense of justice. This is challenged powerfully over the course of the film; Reid must carve himself a new justice as he comes to term with the faults in the system, and its ineffectuality in the lawless West. After years away in the East, building his respect for the law, he returns to his home town as the new District Attorney, on the same train that is carrying the outlaw Butch Cavendish, and an imprisoned Tonto. Cavendish escapes, and Reid is swiftly deputised by his Texas Ranger brother, setting out to aid in the recapture.Tonto's after Cavendish for different reasons, seeking atonement for the mistakes of his past. There's silver in them there hills, and the location of a rich vein was unwittingly revealed to Cavendish by a young Tonto. This folly cost the boy dearly: Cavendish murdered Tonto's entire village to keep the location a secret. Unable to come to terms with this act of brutality, Tonto convinced himself that the outlaw is a wendigo, a cannibal demon.Much like other films that revive a beloved franchise, The Lone Ranger spends its time with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and is packed full of tip-of-the-hat homage. This nostalgia trip rubs off the generation that grew up with the classic incarnations, who are waiting for a cry of ""Hi-yo Silver, away!"" or a rousing rendition of Rossini's William Tell Overture, both of which are delivered, and wisely held back until the finale. For the uninitiated, the film provides a welcome introduction to some great characters, and the osmosis of popular culture ensures the atmosphere feels familiar nonetheless.The choice of the relatively unknown Hammer to play the Lone Ranger preserves some of the mystery of the character that might have been difficult with a familiar Hollywood face. Hammer handles the role with the good natured comic charm of Brendan Fraser in The Mummy (1999). As this is a Lone Ranger who is still learning the ropes of heroism, the casting allows Tonto to step into the limelight and spend more time driving the story. The framing device is that of an elderly Tonto circa 1933, the date of the first radio serial, who regales a young fan with his tall tales of old west adventure.Johnny Depp gives a typically quirky performance as Tonto. There's plainly something of a certain pirate captain coming through in the character's mannerisms, but Tonto's spirituality and raison d'être are different enough from Jack Sparrow's love of mammon and the bottle to keep the interpretation original.With focus on the relationship between the two leads, secondary characters have limited screen time, and are underdeveloped. But the cast is rounded out nicely. An unrecognisable William Fichtner is suitably despicable as the cannibalistic Butch Cavendish, his harelip revealing a gold tooth. Helena Bonham Carter shows up, as a brothel madam who gives the heroes their next clue. There's even a Custer-esque Cavalry Officer who attempts his own Little Big Horn against the Comanche.The Lone Ranger has truly been a highlight of the summer film calendar. It manages to be both a traditional western that captures the spirit of old Hollywood, and revisionist in its interpretation of the characters.

Perhaps that's right but I am writing this several years after the release and I still think they screwed up this movie. Others have written about this movie's faults so I won't rehash them other than to say that this is not a bad action movie but it is a bad Lone Ranger movie. It's a shame because after the 1981 film (which bombed) and this one (one of Disney's biggest money-pits), plus the overall decline of westerns I doubt if The Lone Ranger will ever be remade.

247,tyreeewebster,Retro Reviews- The Lone Ranger (2013),8,16 October 2013,"After 32 years off of the screen, The Lone Ranger and Tonto are back with a bang in one of the years' most explosive releases! The film is about District Attorney, John Reid (Armie Hammer) and his strange Native American friend, Tonto's (Johnny Depp) earliest effort to put corruption to an end, and bring justice to the Wild West! Now, I'm just going to say that this is in no way a perfect movie. It's bloated, it's very long and the story isn't all that clear. However, it is a really, really, fantastically entertaining movie, and it's also hysterically funny.The first thing to talk about are the performances, so let's start with our lead character, John Reid or 'The Lone Ranger'; now, seeing that this is actor, Armie Hammer's first lead role in a motion picture, I won't criticize him too harshly. Armie did just fine as the Ranger, he wasn't the most charismatic hero I've ever seen, nor was he the most entertaining part of the film, but he was a fun, bumbling hero who has his own epic scenes in the film, too. To be fair, though, Armie does have a lot to give to us as an audience when he is acting alongside the always charismatic and charming, Johnny Depp. Which brings me to my next point, Johnny Depp's performance as Tonto is what you would expect, it's Johnny Depp shtick, it's his usual prancing around in a funny costume with a silly voice, giving us an entertaining performance, it's worked for him for the last 10 years and I don't see it going anywhere. The strange thing is, though, Tonto is very over the top and their for comedic purposes, but he's also rather endearing, and this is shown in his very tragic back story that is seen during the middle of the film. If anything, Johnny Depp's Tonto carries the movie, but I'm not saying that Armie Hammer didn't do a good job, as I am looking forward to seeing him in future films.The rest of the cast did a decent job, but the absolute best in this movie was William Fichter as the nasty, evil Butch Cavendish; Fichter just plays him so well and has always been excellent in dark or antagonistic roles. He just embodies the character to a near perfect level, being one of the few characters that I wasn't laughing at.The story, like I said, isn't bad, but not clear, either. The greatest advantage this movie has is the humour and the crazy action scenes. All of the action scenes are done to such a grand scale, with the large budget definitely showing up in these areas, everything is done with an old fashioned Western feel to it, and the film features some amazing Buster Keaton- style stunt work, most of it performed by Depp, himself. These scenes were definitely highlights of the film, not counting the two leads who were going to be entertaining characters anyway.Overall, 'The Lone Ranger' is a very flawed, but entertaining film. If you're into explosive Westerns, or something different, or just want to kill some time and have some fun, then give this a watch, because this is one of the most entertaining films ever made, and I really think that the critics need to see that.Directed by: Gore Verbinski Produced by: Jerry Bruckheimer & Gore Verbinski Written by: Ted Elliott, Justin Haythe & Terry RossioStarring: Armie Hammer, Johnny Depp, Ruth Wilson, William Fichter, Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, James Badge Dale & Helena Bonham Carter",The Lone Ranger

249,vampiri,jack sparrow incarnated,4,3 July 2013,"In one of my Reviews I wrote that most Movies are rehashes of previously produced ones in various degrees. The Lone Ranger is a major rehash of Pirates of the Caribbean.You have the hero and his companion: the ranger and Tonto/Will Turner and Jack Sparrow; the crooks: Butch Cavendish/Barbossa; and secondary crook: Fuller/Norrington. Both deals with vengeance of sorts; there's a girl to save and so on. The only difference is the period in time where the Movies are set.Plot: Attorney (Hammer) is on his way back home to start off his career. On the train he encounters Tonto (Depp) and a gang of thugs. After the escape of a convict (Fichtner) he decides to join his brother, a Texas Ranger, on a mission to recapture the convict. During his mission he encounters Railway men and various crooks who are not what they appear to be.The Movie does not entice you, it is not involving, you don't really care about the main characters and above all, it does not get the slightest bit exiting. It also lacks the Comedy and charm of Pirates of the Caribbean. I am a great fan of Johnny Depp. Unfortunately his acting style has gotten stuck in Sparrow/Charles and the Chocolate Factory/Alice in Wonderland style. All these Movies are fantastic, but Depp's acting has become boring. What he needs is a ""regular"" Movie, i.e. a cop Movie or thriller preferably in a bad guy role.Armie Hammer does his job, not more.What saves the Movie from total disaster is the supporting cast of sir Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper and William Fichtner who all make solid performances and totally outshine Depp and Hammer.There will probably be, GOD FORBIDD, a sequel or two.I will give it 4 out of 10, a nice father and son-Movie night with popcorn kind of Movie, but, however, not Worth its weight in silver.",The Lone Ranger
250,thefadingcam,Entertainment with some identity issues,6,23 August 2013,"Gore Verbinski, for this matter director of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy and Rango, returns with Disney and Johnny Depp reviving the old school cartoon ""The Lone Ranger"". The Lone Ranger has many pros and many cons as it will divide its audience. It is as highly entertaining movie, very fun to watch, gripping and funny, a very good time to be spent. However, if you dissect it, The Lone Ranger has some identity issues. Johnny Depp's character Tonto is too similar to the Pirate's Jack Sparrow and in Lone Ranger he should not be presented as almost the main character. It just sounds fake and easy. The movie sometimes tries to reach some depth, trying to be more than just entertainment, just as Verbinski did on Rango, but it shouldn't and it misguides its intentions, completely spoiling that depth as the old Tonto tells the story of the Lone Ranger to a kid (was that presentation really necessary?). At the end, a good, yet confusing, entertaining high budget movie with Johnny Depp as another (perhaps too much) iconic character. Maybe its time for him to stop disguising himself and putting make-up. At least, even tough Helen Bonham Carter is here, this is not a Tim Burton movie...

251,homdeb1058,I Was Robbed,1,14 July 2013,"I went into this movie cold, without reading any critics or viewer reviews, thinking I was going to see a serious Action, Adventure, Western about the brave, decisive, heroic, competent, masked vigilante ex-Texas Ranger, John Reid, with Johnny Depp, as loyal sidekick Tonto, providing a little comic relief. Instead, the Lone Ranger is portrayed as a bumbling, inept, idealistic lawyer who refuses for the whole show to pick up a gun while people around him are being brutally murdered. Johnny Depp plays a fairly clever, competent Native American, newly met acquaintance Tonto, who is reduced to doing bad slapstick comedy and one-liners, while saving poor John Reid repeatedly and grudgingly from terminal situations. The movie bounces from deadly serious butchery in one scene to stupid comedy in the next, back and forth. And between these two extremes were long scenes that I found incredibly boring--so much so that I seriously considered waling out.Perhaps it was time to upgrade Tonto from whiteman's helper/sidekick to a more equal status? Then why not make Tonto a Harvard Law school graduate, equal in intelligence and education to John Reid, instead of making Reid a bumbling incompetent, so Tonto would look smarter? Apparently the boys in charge don't really believe that ""savages"" can be equals, they just want you to think they do.I imagine if you go see this movie expecting to see a serious epic adventure of your childhood hero, The Lone Ranger, you will be hugely disappointed. If you don't care if the Lone Ranger is a bumbling idiot, saved by the reluctant efforts of a tired and disgusted Tonto, you might enjoy it.I note that this ""huge summer blockbuster"" was showing, opening week, in the smallest theater in a 12 screen Ceneplex-- the larger theaters being reserved for the more realistic and lucrative movies like The Heat and Monsters Inc. Guess the theater manager didn't have much hope for TLR either.",The Lone Ranger
252,ankitbbd,Disappointing,4,26 May 2016,"When I first saw the trailer of this movie,it really looked good having good action scenes and some comedy.But there was nothing new to show in the movie which wasn't shown in trailers.There were so many illogical scenes in the movie which doesn't make any sense.Johnny Depp's character was similar to his most lovable character of Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of The Caribbean,but somehow not up to the marks.Movie could have been much better if director would have focused more on screenplay and action scenes.Don't watch this movie with higher expectations.Even you can skip this.Maybe Johnny Depp fans may enjoy this movie.Overall I give it 4/10.",The Lone Ranger

Needless to say i think the movie was pretty good overall. Some people didn't like the music in the movie just cause it wasn't jazz music and so forth. Well it is a modern redention of the movie; so that explains why. I really enjoyed the characters, the plot and especially the character Gatsby, it made me feel like i was in 1922 Long Island New York in the summer. I'd be willing to see it again just to see it again. it is a little long; and the party scene or one of them went on and on it wondered how long the party would be. I will always remember that little green lighthouse across the harbor in my mind.",The Lone Ranger
254,Junreviews,"It is quite gimmicky, but also quite exciting",7,18 July 2013,"Watching Johnny Depp hopping on the train as a mischievous Native warrior, Tonto whose mug gives a similar impression of one of the most distinctive and unique characters, Jack Sparrow make me think of ""The Lone Ranger"" as just a sloppy Western movie that is made merely to take advantage of Pirates of the Caribbean or Rango fame.However, as judging the movie based on trailers is just as risky as judging the book by its cover, I unexpectedly say it is enjoyable as the majority of scenes are filled with detailed traditional 1930's accouterments and historically well-depicted environments along with epic train battles, timely boosted by the perfect theme music, ""William Tell Overture."" The main concern with this film is Tonto's image being overlapped with the image of Jack Sparrow (Since both characters belong to Disney), but I am wrong as I underestimate the talent of Johnny Depp who is a master of disguise. Not only does Johnny execute the role of Tonto in both comical and serious ways but the rest of the cast does their best to meet the standards of old western style by unleashing nifty movements with pistols and garters, including the wicked white horse that behaves in the exact opposite way to its serene and sacred image. The highlight of the movie, the maneuvering trains in various ways with a help of Visual effects is beyond my expectations. By utilizing and capitalizing as much equipment and surroundings as possible, everyone is able to show their personalities and capabilities in a short period of time without inducing confusions or boredom. To jump on the gimmicky parts, a statue of Tonto displayed in the museum coming to life to tell his story to a little boy look rather typical as Disney uses this type of method. I feel bemused about the group of Texas Rangers getting killed by a couple of shots from enemies who stake out on top of the hill when the protagonist, Reid aka Lone Ranger who seems more vulnerable and inexperienced survives right in front of enemies. I guess once bitten, twice shy.Overall, it is a fun movie with lots of vigor. Some of those scenes are overly exaggerated as I discover a person missing the perfect chance to shoot an enemy by hesitating and delaying by tinkering intentionally which has been pointed out in Pirates of Caribbean as well.",The Lone Ranger
255,mclong2009,Not a home run. but a solid double,7,25 September 2016,"Well, obviously I saw this movie on video, since it's been 3 years since it's release in the theaters. Due to all the negative reviews at the time, I decided to skip ""The Lone Ranger"". But I enjoyed all the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, and I really liked Mr. Verbinski's ""Rango"", so I decided to give this film a shot. I am glad I saw it on video, it gave me a chance to pause it off after 30-45 minutes. If I had seen it in the theaters, I would have been fidgeting. But it's a entertaining movie. It goes off on tangents like the Pirates movies, but for some reason those movies managed to hit it out of the park, while ""The Lone Ranger"" only manages a heads-first slide in double. Mr. Depp is interesting to watch, as usual. Mr. Wilkinson plays his usual alpha-evil white male. Mr. Hammer is certainly a fresh face. The white horse steals a scene or two. All in all, certainly worth a 2.99 rental.",The Lone Ranger
256,jwbeller,Thoroughly Enjoyable. The Critics Got It Wrong Again.,6,13 July 2013,"My wife and I go to see two movies a week, many independent films and some movie blockbusters. Most of the action blockbusters like The Man Of Steel and Iron Man 3 are complete disappointments. Some like World War Z are decent. Until yesterday, I hadn't seen an action blockbuster that was worth more than a 7 since the original Iron Man. (Well the Amazing Spiderman was pretty darn good, but the younger crowd claimed it didn't have enough action.) Because of the overwhelming negative reviews by the critics, we were buying a ticket to The Lone Ranger with very low expectations, and were we wrong. To my wife and I, the movie is a western masterpiece, albeit with a lot of tongue in cheek humor. It has a good story that is easy to follow, and top quality action sequences (unlike Man of Steel where we were praying that the last 45 minutes of over the top, meaningless action would stop). We particularly enjoyed the last 15 minutes, with the William Tell Overture score by Hans Zimmer playing in the background. The performance by Johnny Depp's with his goofy facial expressions was worth the price of admission. He was the star, but Armie Hammer did a really good job too. The rest of the supporting cast was generally very good. My wife and I highly recommend that you go to see this movie. The critics, obviously in my opinion, don't always get it right; and most of them certainly didn't here. I whole heartily agree with critic Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer who wrote, ""A wild, wacky, wide- screen reimagining of the vintage radio serial and TV series, the film - with Armie Hammer in the hat and mask, galloping across Texas righting wrongs, and Depp as his trusty Indian sidekick, Tonto - is an epic good time.""",The Lone Ranger

It's beautifully and joyously subversive at every turn.The comic timing between the two leads is perfect. The supporting cast is great.I think these may be Johnny Depp's finest moments on film so far.Great plot, script, performances, superb editing and score.I want sequels!

It is more of a tongue and cheek spoof that barely reflects even a glimmer of the original legendary character. It isn't even good enough to be called a western.Why do the folks in Hollywood insist on destroying history with these remakes and then changing them into comedic flops? I can't say, but I for one am very disappointed with most every remake since the early 2000's, most especially this one.The story of the Lone Ranger and the programs entailed are classic art history. You wouldn't repaint the Mona Lisa and call it a new masterpiece. Don't trash the history that so many of us have lived and grown up with. But that's exactly what Hollywood has done here with this film and so many others of recent.I don't even see how newcomers can find this appealing. Perhaps they just love Johnny Depp so much that anything he does seems great. I really don't know and can't explain the reviews that give high praise to this film. It is undeserving no matter how you slice it. Even the professional critics shot this one down. Many say don't believe the critics. I say do!

259,generationfilm,The Lone Ranger- A Schizoprenically Toned Continuation of the Pirates Franchise Template that Results in Messy Chaos and an Overall Charmless Experience,4,3 July 2013,"Not many characters are as recognizable in designated look, familiar western setting, and even theme music as the ""Lone Ranger"" who started out his adventures on a campy yet endearing radio serial in 1933, with 2,956 episodes spanning over 21 years, and even continued on to an equally charming television run of eight years that can also be described as entertaining camp. Unfortunately one of those chosen words, specifically entertaining, can't be used to describe Gore Verbinski's latest interpretation of the iconic character that ends up being a tonally schizophrenic and exhaustingly unexceptional trek through the terrain of mediocrity. In the attempt to modernize the story there just feels to be an odd sense of denial as to what the character was and what it needs to be for any screen interpretation leading to an often times disrespectful and entirely mixed presentation from the very beginning to the tiresome end. The trouble with The Lone Ranger is that it has the stench of hubris coupled with blatant historic revisionism packed into a disastrously bland story that inevitably never embodies any of its desired influences, including the western and the brainless action summer blockbuster. No amount of eccentric jokiness, passionless homage to previous westerns, or Johnny Depp were able to save this lazy continuation of the Pirates of the Caribbean formula which has brought everything along including the overly lighthearted tone, the strange characters, and the bloated stunts and yet has refused to keep that initial sense of fun that made the first Pirates so guiltily entertaining. The claim from producer Jerry Bruckheimer that he would introduce the character in ""a fresh and exciting way"" becomes the best delivered joke of the existing film because there is absolutely nothing exciting or even fresh about Gore Verbinski's insanely expensive ($250 million), inconsistently toned, uncomfortably long, and implausibly messy Lone Ranger. When the best possible comparison to your lighthearted western can only be Barry Sonenfeld's Wild Wild West then you know the Lone Ranger has taken the more-is-better philosophy on action and inevitably becomes too loud, too tedious, and too pointless. The crux of the issue with Verbinski's chaotic tiptoeing around what is deemed a sacred cow, an interpretation that doesn't enter parody nor does it accept the subtlety of homage, is that he has delivered a neutered protagonist in a story where the stakes are never felt which gives us exactly what the ""Lone Ranger"" was not, charmless and unadventurous.Read more on this title: http://wp.me/py8op-Ai; Read more reviews: Generationfilm.net",The Lone Ranger
260,jeffreyjets,"Great Western, critics are useless as Usuall!",10,8 July 2013,"As a Western, it was a 10. It is so much better than what any Critic ever wrote anything about it. It seem to me that critics are a part of the media and the media likes to shape public opinion if they can. Critics fail so often when it comes to movies, because moviegoers know what's good, that they periodically like a good and decent movie just to prove they have a normal bone in their body. The critics love to praise warped and twisted movies. If the critics have praised a movies, 9 times out of 10 it is warped and twisted in someway. Anyways, off the soapbox...The movie itself is a good traditional Western with some good smirks and laughs in it. I do like that they went in to the past and Tonto had a good reason for being off. I like the story telling, but not narrating. Armie Hammer did well as the Lone Ranger, but I do wish they would have given him a bit more oomph! but his character was interesting had some depth...(and I just realized why the media hated it...when you 1st met him, he did not believe in guns.)The acting was fine, the sub-plots were good, writing was fine and the jokes hit well for the most part.

I thought Cowboys and Aliens was horrible. At least that was a original though incredibly stupid movie. Hollywood has forgotten how to make a western. Mr. Depp , really ? How many more movies do you need to wear eyeliner in ? They ruined Dark Shadows. They ruined Wild WIld West.They ruined Green Lantern and Burton's Batman movies all stunk except for about 50% of the first movie. The reboot of Superman before Man of Steel . . . O M G. Where is that poor Brandon Rauch or whoever he was. What's next ? Casablanca where Ilsa is a lesbian - oh no wait - they did that to PSYCHO !!! Whaaaatt? Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves ... uhhh telescopes and explosions and Kevin (Why even attempt and English accent ) Costner paired up with the great Morgan Freeman amazingly cast as his ""Moorish"" best friend ? Oh really ? Well maybe we should appease white America and remake Malcom X except insert ""his"" secret best white friend? Or we could do Ali and make him bisexual.WHat about the horrifying versions of Tarzan ? Where is Miles O'Keefe or Chris Lambert these days? I wish I was younger because Hollywood has destroyed so so many great old stories and I know I could do a better job if I ever had the ability to be a movie producer. And worst of all . . . hey got about 75% of John Carter right but if you never read the books you have NO idea what they are talking about so maybe you got 10 % of what the heck was going on.Now they will never do the right thing with John Carter which a kick ass story as is Tarzan which they get small pieces of correct but always fail.",The Lone Ranger
264,Frogfisher,A big entertaining western flick but maybe too big,8,3 September 2013,"The Lone Ranger is an iconic character. So iconic that he has inspired other masked heroes. You need something special for a character like that. At least thats was the thought behind this years film. The story is almost identical to the classic story of The Lone Ranger. 6 Texas Rangers ride in to Byrant's Gap chasing Butch Cavendish. Only one of them survives the younger brother of the captain. Set on capturing his brothers killer he puts on a mask made from his brothers vest and sets out assisted by Tonto, his native American sidekick and Silver his white horse.Certain aspects have been changed with all characters now being connected through their past in some way as is the custom in modern adaptions. A few bizarre and dark items have been added. But a load of humour has been added as well. The whole thing is intended as a story told to a young fan by a much older Tonto. It is a quick story that still manages to feel a but drawn out towards the end. It is broken up in a quirky way once in a while as the kid Tonto is narrating to interrupts in disbelief. And understandable feeling as the film becomes more and more incredible in its action and certainly some elements concerning Tonto. It is hard to tell how serious we are supposed to take the film with its mix of genuine drama, dark elements, dark humour, slapstick humour and fantasy action. It becomes a bit much.Armie Hammer is better here than most of his previous work, but with the same demeanour and the same comedic touch. It is a mostly dislikable character those very typical for Hollywood. But Hammer manages to carry being the title character reasonably well with a mix of overacting and charms. Johnny Depp who is supposed to be the side kick pretty much pushes the ranger forward the whole time. And of course manages to steal pretty much every scene. It is a miracle Hammer manages to remain the main character throughout playing up against Depp. Depp is okay in the role channeling only partly his typical quirky characters and managing to find new ground. However why they gave him a fake nose which is only really noticeable in a few scenes is a bit odd. William Fichtner is alright as a dark villain playing it balanced enough not to make him too macabre despite his actions in the film. James Badge Dale has the probably most likable character in the film and he makes him more so. You feel like you want to see more of him. Tom Wilkinson is one of his sort of generic baddies and could he be replaced with any other generic baddie actor. Ruth Wilson is a bit confusing. A times acting like a tough damsel in distress who goes chasing the baddies on the side of train in a big dress for no significant reason... but she never really conveys that she can take care of herself she just acts determined. The film does know it is a bit of hot pot of things. Tonto keeps saying ""nature is out of balance"" which allows for a lot of craziness but is only used in a couple of humorous situations and a single ""wtf""-moment. The rest plays a long as a typical (maybe even stereotypical) western with a bit of jokes thrown in and Jack Sparrows Indian cousin running along. Until the end when the film realises the action is going to be silly and they change pace, music and location to allow for some truly grand action in the vein of Buster Keaton and co. This confuses one while watching.The effects are great. They come off very real and match the atmosphere incredibly well. And it is very beautifully made with great shots of the landscape and toned down colours. The action pieces are a mix of CGI and stunt work. It is all seamless woven together and very atmospheric. There is no complaints about the visual side of the film to be found. Unless one counts the visual gags.The film is a hard sell because of the label Western. It has been like that for years. But Disney probably thought that since Pirates had been a tough sell before their Pirates of the Carribbean franchise they could pull this off if they added enough Depp and effects. Adding Bruckheimer and Verbinski seems like a safe choice as well. And to be honest I can it see work without all of this... and with. It is gamble to throw money after the film to make it work. And you can feel they did. It feels and look expensive. It feels too big.The film is a grand entertaining western probably the biggest western I have seen that actually feels like a western. But it is confused what it wants to be none the less. It is a well done film with a visually strong and talented director. But it is a bit bland story and character wise and it feel a bit long. Had the director been someone else the film might have come out worse. It is very easy to imagine so.As my wife said: ""I normally wouldn't have paid to see this film"". I agree. I like it and it is entertaining. But I could easily have waited until the DVD release. However I do still want to see the sequel!",The Lone Ranger
265,t-hf,"Excellent, Don't believe a word from the critics.",10,15 January 2014,"Something makes me think that the critics are either all taking crazy pills or are an alien armada that have a grudge against a member of the crew. The film is brilliant and is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the best films in Disney's cannon. However, as with any film, it is not without it's faults.The film is basically a reinterpretation of The Lone Ranger, the famous American hero. His sidekick is native American warrior Tonto (played by Johnny Depp, with all of his expected quirks and mannerisms). Long story short, The Lone Ranger and Tonto team up and set off on a journey to exact revenge on the criminals that did them wrong. What follows is an hour and a half of humour, exciting adventure and unforgettable characters. The Lone Ranger role was tailor-made for Armie Hammer, who is perfect as the lawman turned outlaw with a strict sense of morals and I don't think anyone else could have played Tonto but Johnny Depp, who brings all his typical quirks to role, ultimately turning him into a native American Jack Sparrow. The action is great, boasting one of the greatest climaxes I have seen in recent times, and the film is ultimately an exciting ride that you will want to tag along for.However, as I said earlier, no film is without fault. At times during the first hour, you will find yourself asking ""where is The Lone Ranger"", some scenes are surprisingly violent (tip for parents showing this film to kids), and the film is very long (also a tip for anyone watching the film at night). But rest assured, go along with whatever the film has to offer and you will be in for a treat.",The Lone Ranger
266,ihatespike,"An ugly, poorly sewn quilt, made with stolen material.",1,24 January 2014,"This film is living proof that imitation is not necessarily flattering, as it is nothing but a lumbering Frankenstein's Monster composed of things that worked for other movies. The music is Hans Zimmer ripping off his score from Sherlock Holmes, but with an irritating western twang. The plot is ripped from both Zorro movies, Sherlock Holmes, Shanghai Noon, and maybe even Wild Wild West. Johnny Depp plays a Lady Gaga-ified Tonto/Captain Jack Sparrow with strep throat. Helena Bonham Carter rips off the girl from Planet Terror of all things. The only thing this movie DIDN'T rip off was the original Lone Ranger! The tone of the movie was MIND-NUMBINGLY BI-polar as it was both disturbingly violent at times and then childishly stupid, the camaraderie between Tonto and the Lone Ranger was nonexistent and replaced with a lackluster antagonistic partnership (a sad attempt at the Holmes/Watson dynamic), Armie Hammer was a passable Lone Ranger, but the character was so indecisive, absurdly and counterproductively principled and bumbling it created an agitating atmosphere of incompetence, the love interest was dull, and as she was the Lone Ranger's recently dead (REALLY RECENTLY) brother's wife, even if there HAD been chemistry, rooting for them would have felt weird and dirty. The action felt Acme level silly, the CGI was overused and tiresome, and the obvious refusal to decide on gritty realism or campy action left bizarre unexplained plot threads scattered across the film, and last but not least, the intro to the story by an aged Tonto made the tale feel like the depressing reminiscence of a dying, delusional old has-been. Normally I give a few points for style, but considering how they only go to highlight how much money was wasted on this disappointment, my rating is 1. Avoid.",The Lone Ranger

269,atk92,Sensory Overload,4,8 September 2013,"I took my little brother and his friend to see this movie because it was a midnight premiere and no one else was willing to stay up until 3am to watch a movie with them. They both liked it, so obviously this movie isn't for me, and I get that. However, that doesn't mean that I don't like a good shut-off your brain and watch experience. This movie just rubbed me the wrong way in almost every possible manner. From a storytelling standpoint I absolutely hated the constant interruptions by the kid. It ruined pacing and brought each scene to a dead stop. The plot was predictable to the point of being painful. I literally predicted who the villain was the first time I saw him on screen. These are just two minor complaints. The two major complaints I have are tonal issues, and Gore Verbinski's predictable sensory overload finale.The tone of this movie is all over the map from scene to scene. It is so obvious for most of the film that this is meant to be a comedy, but then they randomly throw in incredibly dark moments of cannibalism and genocide. One scene, I kid you not, has one of the antagonists massacring Indians, and effectively his garrison wipes out an entire tribe. The very next scene is a slapstick moment of comedy with a blindfolded Lone Ranger hilariously escaping a death squad. That may be unnoticed by most movie-goers, but it is just something that bothered me.Of course there must be a mention of the finale. I could include the intro train scene of the movie in this category as well, but I'll just stick with the ending sequence. Gore Verbinski has had a tendency to create a ridiculously stylized and over the top finish to all of his movies, just look at the second and third pirates movies. Apparently this is a hit with the audiences, and it hasn't ever seemed to really bother me before, but this time was different. I was subjected to a 10 minute extended version of the William Tell Overture Finale while an action scene that was fast-paced, CGI-filled, insanely-edited, and emotionless went on the the background. My brain just wanted to stop watching because it simply did not care anymore.Little kids may have a lot of fun with this movie, but at a running time of two and a half hours it stretches to the point of unbearable. There was absolutely no charm to this movie whatsoever for me, and I would call it the worst movie I saw at the theaters over the summer.",The Lone Ranger
270,dbryn,Hollywood Is Afraid To Make Something Original!,5,9 July 2013,"I was so excited to see the new Lone Ranger. Even though the movie's been done a number of times before, I think it's somewhat fairgame since it's been 30yrs? Then I saw the trailers for it and was immediately turned off. Instead of simply writing the movie off, I explored what turned me off on the trailer. It looked funny, not necessarily funny 'ha ha', but funny/ridiculous. Secondly, the action looked over the top and borderline ridiculous. Thirdly, the Tonto character looked extremely similar to Jack Sparrow. I picked this all up from just the trailer, this is what turned me off before I had even read a review. Then, the reviews poured in. 25% on Rotten Tomatoes... critics calling it the worst movie of the year. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see it.There are certain things that a western MUST have in order to be good, in my opinion... and if you look back at any successful western, they all have these features: 1. Good vs Evil is the spine of the story. 2. It's got to be realistic, especially if you are dealing with western legends. 3. PEOPLE see westerns to see an active protagonist that they admire. A cowboy that will take us back into time and let us imagine what it would be like to be a bada$$ gunslinger. 4. The story has to be gritty with violence and our hero has to be put in jeopardy. **This holds true for True Grit, Tombstone, Young Guns, Unforgiven, pretty much any Eastwood or spaghetti western. Note: I wouldn't say Django Unchained was a western, it was a Tarantino flick (and I personally hated it).I figure there are four key reasons why this movie is a flop and I'm dumbfounded why Disney couldn't spot this in the script, before they sunk $250MM into this picture. 1. The Lone Ranger bumbled through most of two hours without doing ANYTHING... it was Dumb & Dumber and Dumb was being dragged through the story by Dumber the entire way. The Lone Ranger didn't fire a single shot until the final 35mins of a 2.5hr flick? So, who cares about this guy fighting for Justice... because he didn't fight for anything the entire movie. He was talking the talk without walking the walk. 2. John Reid's brother has just been shot and your cracking jokes 5mins later? The Comanche have just been slaughtered and Tonto is cracking jokes 5mins later, at least it seemed as such. You couldn't take anything seriously throughout the entire movie. The worse predicament the duo got into was they were buried up to their necks with small scorpions crawling over them while they cracked jokes at one another. Why should we invest any empathy in these clowns? 3. We want to see something original, not the high priced JACK SPARROW thrust into a bad western, and that's exactly what it was. Take the dead bird and makeup off of Tonto, give him an accent, a sash, and a sword and you have the exact same character. Even their mannerisms were the same. This is great for Jack Sparrow who is original to Pirates of the Caribbean, but Jack Sparrow is not Tonto in anyone's mind. 4. Unfortunately, westerns are a hard sell and thanks to this catastrophe of a movie, it will be an even tougher sell going forward for the good westerns. Knowing that westerns are a hard sell, why would anyone sink $250MM into it? Are the train scenes and sfx really worth the price tag? Which brings me to my other point, we want something realistic... not horses standing on trees, horses getting drunk, horses climbing onto the roof of a barn, horses leaping off the roof of a 2.5 story barn, horses diving from a train car the second the train is going through a tunnel.As I watched the movie, I had a couple of story logic questions... how did Tonto get out of prison, for one. The movie immediately addresses this when the kid at the fair asks the same question, as if pointing directly to the fact that they don't even know or care to tell us how.For those who haven't seen the movie and are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard... the new Lone Ranger movie is like the recent Dukes of Hazzard movie in comparison to the original TV series... except worse.Overall, I'd give the movie a 5 (watchable) and it would score higher if it didn't have a masked man named the Lone Ranger. If this was titled anything else that made us believe this was more comedy than western... the movie would have scored higher but still would've flopped, because who in their right mind would sink $250MM into this... and I'm curious what cost $250MM? Surely it wasn't all Johnny?Seriously Disney, you can't advertise a historic classic like The Lone Ranger and give us slapstick comedy that is Dumb & Dumber on horses. What a shame.",The Lone Ranger
271,flatrich,Hi-ho!,10,11 July 2013,"I really don't get what happened to Westerns. When I was a tyke, I found them irresistible - Hoppy was my first hero. The Lone Ranger was up there too. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels riding away into the hills of Burbank while some townsperson asked the inevitable: ""Who was that masked man?"" When I first learned that Johnny Depp was doing The Lone Ranger as a feature, and playing Tonto no less, I had no doubt Depp would pull it off. Even with the concerns raised by Native Americans - and I have read pros and cons in Indian Country Today and elsewhere - I just couldn't be dissuaded. I figured after all those great pictures, Depp knew what he was doing.If you like Westerns, especially mixed with nonstop action and comedy, you will love The Lone Ranger. Depp is brilliant, as expected, and so are Armie Hammer (as The Lone Ranger) and William Fichtner (as Butch Cavendish) and everyone else. Gore Verbinski has a real feeling for The Old West of Hollywood Past (Rango was animated, but he gave us the same Western fun in that one) and even though a lot of Indians get killed in The Lone Ranger, so do plenty of them bad guy white people.Much gunplay and other violence - too much bloodshed for little kids, although the two sitting in front of me didn't seem to mind.

272,Cs_The_Moment,Enjoyable Western Adventure That is Unfairly Criticised,9,27 May 2014,"The Lone Ranger tells the exciting tale of the Lone Ranger, John Reid (Armie Hammer), from the perspective of Native American warrior Tonto (Johnny Depp), who rescues him and offers his help in bringing the notorious Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) to justice, which throws the pair into many adventures along the way.I was surprised to see that many critics had dismissed this film and it has actually been a flop at the box office. Even from the very beginning I felt caught up in the adventure and found it to be very thrilling. It has a lovely Western setting and lots of brawls and gunfights (although reasonably tame as this is a family film). I think part of the charm of the film is that the tale is being recounted from the perspective of Tonto, now an elderly man, to a young boy full of excitement and amazement for the story, eager to learn more. It resonates those childhood memories of being enchanted by a bold story such as this, that lingers in the mind and fuels the imagination, something that we eventually grow out of a little, and I liked the reminiscent touch that this offered. Even as an adult the plot is still thrilling and it's something of a different offering from Disney, more along a Pirates of the Caribbean feel in terms of adult themes and action sequences. Johnny Depp is outstanding in this, really embracing the role of the Native American warrior and bringing his own brand of quirkiness to it that brings a few laughs. Armie Hammer, an unknown actor to me until now, also impressed me in this film, as the somewhat reluctant but heroic Lone Ranger. The more minor characters were also relative unknowns to me, besides Helena Bonham Carter, but I didn't feel there was a particularly weak link in the casting. The Lone Ranger is an enjoyable Western adventure that is family friendly and exciting. Don't be put off by the negative reviews, I think it's sadly underrated and unfairly criticised – if you're looking for a fun, quirky adventure then give this a shot.",The Lone Ranger

274,B RUBBLE,"Fair, but not great movie",5,10 July 2013,"Perhaps it is because I grew up watching Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels on TV, but I am not all that satisfied with this version. The scenery was good and some of the action was great, but the storyline was a flop. I think Gore Verbinski went over the top trying to make a different and somewhat confrontational link between Hammer and Depp in their characters. Give me the traditional version where The Lone Ranger and Tonto worked together better than portrayed in this movie. I also preferred the ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" with Klinton Spilsbury better than this version. It developed the character of the Lone Ranger better with his mask, silver bullet and his horse ""Silver"".At least they did include the Lone Ranger Theme music in part of the movie, otherwise, did not find the soundtrack all that interesting either. Also interesting although perhaps could have been used more was the character portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter.In short another version of a classic comic hero that falls short, similar to the new ""Man of Steel"" movie.I wonder what Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert would have said about this film.",The Lone Ranger
275,Lunaroseice,"I don't blame the actors, I blame the writers.",5,20 April 2019,I always thought part of the reason the 2013 Lone Ranger movie got bad reviews was largely influenced by the fact that Depp was playing Tonto instead of a Native American actor. I myself wasn't as upset by that as I was confused why they made Tonto look like a Crow Indian Shaman instead of a Comanche Indian. I just watched it. It is a bad movie. Tonto is a bit of an idiot. I don't think a Native American would have wanted to play the part if they had read the script. And the Lone Ranger was a stumbling fool. The basic plot could have been a great movie if they hadn't tried to be so goofy with it. The actors actually did a fantastic job with the script they were given. I don't blame the actors. I blame the writers.,The Lone Ranger
276,armin-durakovic,Spectacular entertainment,8,28 August 2014,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. Johnny Depp was hilarious with his eccentric role as the Indian. He made me to laugh a lot of times with his weird, sarcastic dialogs and scenes. Despite the story is set in wild west, the movie reminds a lot to Pirates of the Caribbean movies. It has a lot of unrealistic moments, but I don't mind, I watched it very open minded as it is a Disney movie, after all. I am aware that the movie is made for kids and it is watchable as pure Hollywood entertainment that drives you through 2:30 hours. A lot of action was put in it and the special effects were great as well as the music from Hans Zimmer. Every movie he makes music for, it gives you a lot more drama and improves greatly the atmosphere in the movie, even if the movie itself is of an average quality. I didn't knew about the Lone Ranger story before I watched the movie. I remember it partly from my childhood, and maybe if I did knew it, it would affect my joy by watching this movie, but for now, I had a great time by watching it.",The Lone Ranger
277,bradencn,Laughed the whole time!,10,7 July 2013,"The Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer combo was fantastic. You know, this PG-13 Disney film is meant to be goofy, funny, and just one where you leave the theater having been able to laugh with the creative writers and actors of this film. The final major scene is built up to so well and ridiculously funny. This is not a movie out there trying to compete with westerns like True Grit (an amazing film for sure), but more along the goofy lines of Pirates of the Caribbean and Shanghai Noon. The film blew my expectations, especially after, in my opinion, a poorly directed trailer. I was engaged the entire time of the film...loved it. Is it completely historically accurate? Haha, no. Is the action a bit unrealistic? Of course. Just have fun.",The Lone Ranger
278,theflixerdotcom,Great film - see it for yourself,8,6 October 2013,"Depp plays Tonto, a wandering Comanche Native American who is hunting an evil spirit and also the man he believe can help him kill that evil spirit. Hammer plays The Lone Ranger, a recent law school graduate looking to bring his sense of fair justice to the town of . A change in events makes him rethink the way he views justice and the law, and along with Tonto, he engages on an adventure to deliver justice as The Lone Ranger. This is a movie that was a whole lot of fun. I really think this movie was killed by bad press and hopefully it makes somewhat of a comeback on retail DVD/bluray sales and digital downloads. I think many people who read about it online and formed an opinion should see it for themselves before jumping to conclusions.The tweaked story was great (Tonto being an equal partner rather than a sidekick), Depp was in his eccentric weirdo element and Hammer did a good job of playing the squeaky clean good guy Ranger. The action and effects were fantastic, the acting was excellent from all involved, and the story was lots of fun.There were some parts where I got a Pirates of the Caribbean vibe which, combined with Depp playing an eccentric Tonto, likely lead to much of the negative press. I get why a critic might find this to be a negative, but my kids ate it up. This movie was very obviously made for families and children and not for professional movie critics who frankly just didn't get it. This was a fun tongue in cheek movie and I'll address the elephant in the room. I didn't find it derogatory to Native Americans. I felt like they were portrayed as heroes and victims here and it was made quite clear that Tonto was a little bit loopy and on his own path. The US military and government were the baddies.The only negative in this movie for me was the run time. It's around 2 hours and 30 mins. I think 30 mins of filler could have easily been cut out and it slows down in the middle a little bit. I don't think the slowdown would have been bad in all movies, but in the case of this movie it kind of kills the momentum a little bit. This is an action packed movie and the slowdown feels a little weird.That said, I highly recommend you watch this movie for yourself and form your own opinion, but I for one loved it and regret it didn't do better.",The Lone Ranger
279,funnygy,Another embarrassment to a legendary hero,4,7 July 2013,"Ever since the Clayton Moore/Jay Silverheels TV series went out of production, Hollywood just doesn't seem able to figure out what to do with The Lone Ranger. First we had the snooze- inducing dud ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger,"" widely considered to be one of the biggest flops of all time. Then there was the god-awful TV movie that aired on The WB in 2003, which attempted to turn the character into a cross between James Bond and Jackie Chan. And now this.Seriously, this version of ""The Lone Ranger"" comes across as two different movies thrown together. There's the semi-serious story of the wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who wants to bring civilized law to the wild frontier, only to find a very harsh reality ruled by big money and the point of a gun. And then there's the utter farce built around Johnny Depp's portrayal of Tonto, which has all the cinematic integrity of a ""Police Academy"" sequel. Unfortunately, this latter movie has far more influence on the final product. I'll admit, it's the 21st century, and today's moviegoers are jaded and cynical. If the character were portrayed as he was originally created, straight as an arrow and stiff as a board, the movie would bomb. But this movie goes way too far in the opposite direction, turning the character into a perpetually flustered pansy. Just when you think you can actually like him, we get another shot of Depp's Tonto making some stupid one-liner or some other cheap attempt at humor that ruins the moment. As if all that weren't bad enough, the script is hopelessly disjointed, jumping all over the place; leaving plot holes big enough to drive a freight train through.I will grudgingly admit that I enjoyed the movie overall, if only because of the great action pieces and the occasional piece of true Western flavor that survived the script revisions and the obviously studio-supervised editing. But at the end of the day, this was yet another embarrassment to a great American hero, one I fear is doomed to never be properly portrayed again.",The Lone Ranger
280,AJSteele,Ruined Ranger,1,2 August 2014,"""The Lone Ranger"" is easily a one star film. No matter what you've heard this movie is regretfully a ""comedy"". I think that if you liked a film like ""The Green Hornet"", this poorly written and acted mess is your kind of entertainment.Like many I'm sure, I was hoping for a straight, no nonsense take on the Lone Ranger, giving this long repressed character the resurgence he needed. This was not to be. It seemed every few seconds you could see a purposeful setup for an intended laugh, but what came instead was a mockery of the characters, forcing an under the breath,"" oh geez"".Why filmmakers would destroy such rich material is beyond comprehension . The start of the movie was a clear giveaway that I was about to witness a bomb. What a horrible segway, and absolutely childish as well. Depp actually had a good voice for Tonto but nothing could save his vaudeville style portrayal of an American Indian.The actor that attempted an embodiment of the Lone Ranger himself is hardly worth mentioning. The only adjective coming to mind is ""pathetic"". What a waste of energy , costumes and sets. It's hard these days when there is so much ability to produce fine films about characters as classic as the Lone Ranger, only to be given shear garbage. Very disappointing.",The Lone Ranger
281,pioneerlythere37,Verbinski and Depp Are Back For Another Exciting Action Movie,9,28 September 2015,"After Rango, one of the best kids movies ever (although it was more for adults), Depp and Verbinski reunite once again for another good film. While Depp does good acting as Tonto, the lunatic Indian that wears a dead bird as a hat, Verbinski is the real winner for his amazing directing, crafting the action scenes with such grace and beauty, resulting in some of the best action scenes in a while. The Lone Ranger is a sort of slapstick western, but doesn't do as well as Rango, which was less slapstick, more real comedy. Sometimes The Lone Ranger can be monstrously funny; then there are the moments where the jokes fall so flat, one has to wonder if an actual joke was being told. Especially in the moments where Verbinski tries to go from dark, disturbing moments, straight to un-amusing humor.A miraculously aged Tonto is on display at a museum in 1933 and comes to life to tell a young boy dressed as the Lone Ranger the story of the Lone Ranger. The story is an exciting one, starting out almost immediately with a miraculous train-fight scene. The movie also ends with an even better, albeit longer train scene. Bandits invade the train, full of Protestants, to free the cannibalistic Butch Cavendish, who is on his way to a public hanging in another car. A fight ensues: Tonto and John Reid against two of Cavendish's thugs. Cavendish gets free, John Reid arrives in his childhood home of Texas, and his brother, the head ranger, recruits him and takes his team to pursue Butch Cavendish. They're ambushed, and the mission is a fateful one. After the ambush, Tonto thinks that John Reid died, so he puts him in a grave and brushes some dirt over him. To Tonto's horror, John Reid suddenly wakes up, and panicked, Tonto knocks him back to unconsciousness with a rock. That's some of the better comedy the film manages to pull off.Then a white spirit horse comes and stands by John Reid's grave, apparently signifying that John Reid is the chosen one, of sorts, and he cannot be killed in battle. Tonto is appalled at the horse's choice, and tries to get the horse to select Dan Reid, but the horse has made up his mind. Apparently the horse is omniscient, and can fly, and teleport, and who knows what else. He appears on roofs to rescue them, stands on a tree limb to eat the leaves...how did he get on that tree? As Tonto says, ""Something very wrong with that horse."" That's probably understating it a little, but at least Tonto did the best he could with his limited vocabulary.Tom Wilkinson as the scheming Latham Cole and William Fichtner as the deformed Butch Cavendish do exceptionally well, along with Helena Bonham Carter as Red, a lady with an ivory leg that shoots bullets out of the heel. The Lone Ranger is a wonderfully made western, and although it falls short at moments, it succeeds in being a gripping, gritty tale that is sure to go down as a classic.92/100",The Lone Ranger

I also heard it repeated on the radio. This ain't that Lone Ranger.Still, if you can allow yourself to enjoy it, it's a fairly enjoyable film. There's action, romance (sort of), humor, and Johnny Depp.The score is fine, as is the cinematography. The action is somewhat over the top, but that's Director Verbinski's stock in trade, isn't it.The acting is adequate and the storyline, although somewhat silly, is entertaining nonetheless.Don't try to compare it to the source materials. It's not worth the aggravation.

283,davidsawyer-me,Simply terrible movie,1,10 August 2013,"Depp is ruining a lot of remakes with his horrible charactures of popular roles. I understand like everybody else that he is just trying to make the role his own and not trying to copy the original character but this stiff robot act is boring. Every remake he's been in he pretty much as the same persona. This movie is getting a lot of great reviews on some sites while on others it's getting really bad reviews. I tend to think that a lot of people that actually worked on this film are simply posting as random people in order to make this terrible boring movie look better than it really is. I mean this movie was so dull at parts and then after a while you get real sick of the constant action scenes. Hollywood seems to be running out of ideas and just leans on CGI explosions and special effects as a crutch. Anyway I think Johnny Depp version of the Native American (Indian) Tonto was also racist and is akin to the same thing as Black Facing when people make fun of African-Americans (Black people). And like I said this robot stiff acting he does is getting so boring. It's like when he totally and utterly ruined Willy Wonka by playing a dull souless automaton. And again like I said before I do understand that Depp is just trying to make these roles his own and most of us understand not to expect him to try to re-create the same exact characters we know and love BUT the real issue here is that he is NOT very good at it. In fact he's not good at all. He is the worst actor in the world when it comes to performing in remakes. Even if he is trying to tweak the characters and make them his own he simply destroys any role he touches. He really only has 2 personas if you think about it. One being the stiff but mousy Edward Scissor Hands and the second being a drunk Capn' Jack who acts like he's having a stroke. Then any role Depp does he tries to do variations on these two cliché' personalities he has but it's basically the same boring roles he uses in all his movies. I would like to see him star in something brand new without it being a remake only if he at least tries to work on a brand new 3rd way of acting. Anyway as far as the movie itself is concerned like I said it was boring at parts and the parts that were full of action was all just your run of the mill CGI movie magic of run of the mill explosions and defying gravity. Which is basically getting boring. And I'm someone who loves a good explosion, chase scene, or special effects in a movie but without any real substance this movie just falls flat. The dialog is terrible, the acting is terrible, you can't relate at all to the Lone Ranger because he himself is a colorless hack who doesn't really pop so much as blend into the background and is upstaged by the CGI special effects. And like I said Tonto seems more like a stiff robot and not the stoic character that Depp intended him to be. Tonto seems more like a stiff Disney robot you'd see on some ride and a rather racist looking one at that. I seriously believe that Depp has over stayed his welcome in Hollywood and that the executives are so out of touch with audiences they keep propping Depp up in front of the camera. I think once his Pirates of the Caribbean fame starts to fade they will clearly see Depp has nothing to go on. Edward Scissor hands propelled him into stardom and Captain Jack kept the momentum going but other than that he has nothing, he is nothing, and he offers nothing. He simply ruins remakes. He's a ""Remake Killer"".",The Lone Ranger
284,dmurilloroman,The Mildly Wild West,6,2 July 2013,"I was really expecting this film to revamp the Westerm genre but it was really toned down. It was very innovative by making Tonto (Johnny Depp) top billed due to the fact that I believed Armie Hammer couldn't have held this film together himself, surprisingly the Lone Ranger doesn't have any unique quality compared to Tonto, Depp's wacky persona is really taken advantage off. Comedically, there were too many cheap laughs with a lot of dumb slapstick humor, at first it was funny but at 2 1/2 hours the laughs quickly dampen. The movie is extremely prolonged and could have been cut shorter by at least a half hour, it's a huge no-no when watching a movie ends up being a chore. There is still a lot of stuff going for this film though, the productions/environments will blow you away and the hard work shows whenever there is any action sequence, these scenes is where the real fun is. The detailed environments bring the wild west alive in this movie but when the story actually goes underway, it ends up settling it down rather than bringing it to life. There are numerous stories going on at once that it doesn't allow you to be effectively involved each story. Like most people, I have high expectations for a Gore Verbinski film, I expected more creativity and it took itself too seriously at times but as always, Verbinski and Depp are still able to have fun.",The Lone Ranger

Amazingly well filmed with stunning action sequences but also a great back story to keep you interested. Johnny Depp was excellent, bringing his trademark droll humour to the part of Tonto. Not quite as sure about Arnie Hammer, who was a bit wimpy, but I warmed to him by the end.Ruth Wilson was winsome as the love interest (and she's a Kentish gal:)while Helena Bonham Carter played the Madam for fun.The only surprise I found was the level of violence, which I wasn't expecting in a Disney film. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for young children and think a 15 rating more suitable than the 12 it was given. I don't think the violence added to it and given that the Lone Ranger was originally very much for children something of a pity.That aside it was very well done and the plot and story improved as the film went on.

This is not an Oscar contender, nor was it ever intended to be, but it is a great popcorn flick. It is violent in certain scenes and may not be suitable for smaller children, but for adults and tweens, it is about right. I did think that the first 10-15 mins or so were a little too slap-sticky for me, but once it gets going, it gets good. To all of the naysayers out there, what did you think you were going to see?

But this time they are flat-out wrong.It's GENUINELY FUNNY; it had me laughing out loud at points (John's intro on the train), and Depp's delivery of the final line of the movie had me in stitches.The story is fantastic (and clichéd), the script is solid. Sadly, the movie does drag slightly in the middle, and so feels like 30 minutes could have been cut, which would help it flow better.The stunts are great, the effects are generally stellar. However, some dodgy CGI and (too) over-the-top bits spoiled it occasionally.There have been too many movies as of late that just haven't been up to scratch, but this isn't one of them.

But if there is such a thing, I'd call it a hard PG-13. You see bullets hit. You practically see someones heart get eaten and so now. Now that we have that out of the way. My only problem with the movie is the pacing. It's sometimes really a little slow, I really takes a long while for the city boy to become ""The Lone Ranger"" which he finally does at the end. It takes about 2 hours or so. While they aren't boring they aren't that exciting either. You have one big action set piece at the end but that's about it.

Even so it does not shrink from depicting the racism and violence directed against the Native Americans in the real West and the fate of two entire tribes is depicted with genuine pity. Like most such retreads it's an origin story which makes a lot of sense because I'm pretty sure we never asked for or needed one on a 30 minute kid's programme, so we never knew how this team-up came to be. Everything from the mask to the silver bullets is neatly explained and actually links to the main plot. What more can you ask? Armin Hammer is a handsome, charming yet believable good guy and Johnny Depp manages to keep his face deadpan for a whole film and is all the better for it. It's a knowing film which still manages to have a lot of love for the genre it's (very gently) ribbing. It's from the producers of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN and that's how you should think of it. It mixes a classic form with a modern taste for the occult and if you call it PIRATES OF THE WILD WEST you're not far off the mark. It's so spot-on it even gets the William Tell Overture into the climax and still makes it thrilling rather than extremely silly. Go and see it but only when you have loads of spare time and are in a mellow laid- back, no-hurry kind of mood. You won't be disappointed.",The Lone Ranger
298,pp312,"I think I get it now...no, wait, I don't!",2,19 April 2014,"This movie made absolutely no sense to me. I began to think dementia must be setting in as I seemed to have lost track of reality--or bad movie reality anyway. But then I remembered that the story was being told to a child by an old Indian and thought, Hey, that's it, all the stupid, unbelievable bits--which is like most of the movie--must be just fantasy the Indian was putting in to amuse the kid--stuff like the savage rabbits and the cavalry riding over Ranger's and Tonto's heads without touching them. Yeah, that's it, because the only other explanation was that the scriptwriter (and everyone who approved his work) was totally deranged, and that couldn't be, surely. So that was okay for a while, but than I thought, Hang on, if it's partly fantasy told from an old Indian's point of view, with the old Indian all wise and stuff and the Lone Ranger, the hero, a snivelling coward, how do we know it isn't ALL fantasy, that the old Indian's just totally demented and making it all up, in which case what's the point? I mean, attack rabbits? How many of those were there in the old west anyway? And cutting people's hearts out and eating them? Was that standard culinary fare back then? And wow, I haven't even come to the most confusing part of this movie yet: the weird mix of moods. One minute you're laughing, or just sort of chuckling unwillingly, and the next a big slurp of realistic violence wipes the smile right off your dial. Most of the time I couldn't figure how I was supposed to react, what the filmmakers' intentions were or if they even cared what the audience reaction would be (but wait! Didn't this movie cost hundreds of millions? They must have cared!).So there you go. I'm just glad to see so many negative reviews. In fact, switching to ""Hated It"" these days, with so many crap ""blockbusters"" coming out (Prometheus anyone?), is like a breath of fresh air, a calming reassurance that my faculties haven't entirely deserted me.",The Lone Ranger
299,annyard1960,what a wonderful surprise,10,17 March 2014,"What a wonderful surprise! Even better upon repeated viewings.It took an hour to lose my initial impressions, created by the poster, previews and reviews. Only later in the movie do we learn what we need to understand the characters and the movie itself.To illustrate, consider Tonto. Some of his actions seemed too cavalier, even offensive early on. Example: Remember how he treated Kemosabe at first. After he digs shallow graves and dumps in the Rangers, Tonto notices one is not dead, grabs a rock and hits him on the head. Ouch!Several events early in this movie were uncomfortable and awkward on first viewing. Only later do we learn why Tonto is ""a bit nutty"". In addition, this movie is one of very few that manages to embody multiple genres and adopt multiple tones - yet somehow manage to make them all complementary.This is simultaneously a western, adventure, buddy film, comedy, historical drama, political statement, homage, moral/ethical/philosophical presentation, special-effects and stunt extravaganza, and more.A couple comments I don't see elsewhere.Many articles claimed the Tonto character was offensive to Native Americans. While I can understand why someone might have this initial reaction from poster, preview, or first hour of the movie, I cannot agree AT ALL in the context of the entire movie. To explain:Tonto suffered a horrific personal disaster. When Tonto is ~10 years old, he saves the lives of two gringos, then helps them recover. Then he gives the gringos an enormous value (the secret location of silver worth billions of dollars in some remote mountains) more-or-less just to be kind. But their tribal custom is to trade, so Tonto accepts a cheap pocket watch for taking them to the silver, which the gringos find is indeed the mother-load of all mother-loads. To assure nobody else learns of this location (which the tribe knew about for generations), the gringos kill EVERYONE in his tribe. When Tonto arrives back home, everyone is dead, including his pet bird.This experience is PLENTY to make anyone a bit nutty. What a burden to bear at age 10, with nobody left to help him cope. This explains why Tonto is a bit odd, and explains why he wears that stupid looking bird on his head --- the bird was his personal pet when the tragedy occurred.I read dozens of articles that claim this movie disrespects Native Americans, and zero who disagree. The reason they give is always the portrayal of Tonto.The overwhelming one-sided nature of this opinion is totally disingenuous and misguided. My first point is... what does anyone expect? The main characters in ALL movies are extraordinary in some ways. If they weren't, they wouldn't be interesting characters. For the first 2/3 of the movie I thought Kemosabe was nuttier, stupider and much less wise than Tonto. Does that mean the movie was an insult to gringos? I mean seriously... give me a break!What would be racist? Make every character of a specific race essentially similar in some negative respect (all stupid, all predators, all killers, all cheaters, etc).So, let's look at this movie. Most of the gringos were extremely nasty bastards. In fact, three of the four main gringo characters were extreme scum of the earth (the exception being the terminally clueless, stupid, naive Lone Ranger, who at least was a ""nice guy""). Most of the other gringos were jerks (including an entire gang of very bad guys, including the entire freaking cavalry by the end of the movie). So what? We should complain about the portrayal of gringos?NO WE SHOULD NOT.To converge on an understanding of this issue, note that ALL the other Native Americans were portrayed as good, kind, gentle, decent folks who minded their own business on the continent they occupied for 100,000 years before endless gringos arrived, laughed at them, mistreated them, and arbitrarily ordered them to stay in certain portions of their own native continent. The Native Americans were overwhelmingly portrayed as good people and VICTIMS who were massively screwed over. This is a reasonably accurate portrayal (albeit not complete), and not the least bit derogatory.Therefore, the only possible reason anyone could complain about portrayal of Native Americans is the Tonto character. But as I explained above, this complaint is without merit.Furthermore, even with his peculiarities, Tonto is portrayed as a wise, talented, lovable fellow. He saves many lives, including Kemosabe several times. And he took incredible personal risks, especially during the amazing chase scene at the end. Who else would even attempt that train-ladder trick, much less pull it off with such hilarious style and timing? On my third viewing I counted the number of times Tonto was insightful, correct and wise, and Kemosabe was wrong - and the result was ""many times"".This movie was GANG RAPED by reviewers, and by everyone who claimed this movie was offensive to Native Americans.",The Lone Ranger
300,in_shahieras_prince,It was fun!,7,7 July 2013,"It was two hours and a half when every scenes were captured with such good drama, action and humors. It was certainly a Johnny Depp's kind of movie. The storyline was kept simple but amazingly entertaining. It wasn't really filled with actions and shooting scenes but I found it really entertaining and worth-watching. It definitely another Pirates of Caribbean's sort of movie. In fact, Tonto really looked like Captain Jack Sparrow. Mr. Depp is a very talented actor and for that, this is a really good movie to be watched. Do not forget the Lone Ranger, John Reid played by Armie Hammer. This prince of Mirror Mirror certainly a good mix with Tonto. It was hilarious yet full of entertaining shooting actions. Even the drama was great on screen. I guess it was a great legend to be told of the Lone Ranger. Of course, the best reason to be reviewed was the fun parts. I would say it was average, especially when it cost almost 150minutes of watching. But I can assure you that it was indeed fun and entertaining. You know how Mr Depp's movie always is, right?",The Lone Ranger

There was a good story line which could interest people of all ages and it wasn't too complicated.There was some great actions scenes throughout, the kinds of which you wouldn't see in any other recent films so in that respect it was quite unique. Johnny Depp's character was well suited to him and the way the friendship develops with the Lone Ranger was good.The setting of the whole film was beautiful and all the costumes from the era were authentic. Visually the whole film was great and I thought the effects were brilliant. There were quite a lot of clichés in this one though and it did drag on for a bit longer than it needed to but I think it's worth a watch for the enjoyable action.",The Lone Ranger
302,eltsr-1,It's strange but VERY true. Also funny!,9,4 May 2016,"Filmed great. Looks great. Great direction. Great action. Johnny Depp as Tonto. Hammer as The reluctant Lone Ranger. It is historically true that Indians mined silver to make bullets. Likewise, US mounted cavalry massacred Indian villages and local settlers killed their own and accused the Indians: PA Wyoming Valley Massacre by Pierce's Militia replicated all the way to Yosemite by others. Railroads and mining operations were colonial advancing foreign economic trade interests. Maniac Civil War militias roamed The West selling directed mob, criminal violence against the public good. All of that fills an action packed movie. Depp is crazy funny against all of the above. Hammer grows into the iconic role. William Tell was as reluctant hero as well. Against the same Euro clown tyranny and terror. Silver lends a timely hand. More Hi! Ho! than you can know. God Bless the United States of America and Hollywood.",The Lone Ranger
303,iepw12,"Very Entertainingand uplifting,ignore unfair criticism",9,22 August 2013,"I have been a Lone Ranger fan for over fifty years ( I have an autographed photo of Clayton Moore and Silver on my mantle), so I was very excited at the prospect of a modern film about the character ever since it has been on the horizon, about a couple of years I guess.I even remember George Clooney's name being linked to the role along with JD as Tonto ,which I thought sounded very interesting. I was a bit disappointed when it finally emerged that a relatively unknown actor would have the role but still with JD as Tonto and I was even more disappointed when I saw the trailers a total of five times and saw JD in interview when he was very down beat about the whole thing making it that it was all about some kind of reversal of roles with Tonto being the instigator of all things rather than the LR. Well, I just returned from my first viewing of the film and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it in every respect.It owed a bit to Buster Keatons General, it definitely had elements of the first Banderas Zorro but for me this was all good cinema. It was entertaining on every level, with enough tributes to the original show to more than satisfy my need for the Lone Ranger effect.( ie good will conquer evil but it expects nor needs any thanks). JD was superb, of course he was but so were the rest of the cast, and as for idiotic behaviour I think all the characters seemed to suffer from that from time to time ,but so what, it all made excellent entertainment, the only one who didn't do anything stupid was probably the horse ,who was truly amazing even if it needed a lot of CGI help in places. I have the pilot of the original show and there was enough in this film to link with that to make it OK for me so I would suggest many critics probably don't have or haven't seen the original pilot or just didn't get all the references which I picked up on. For example Clayton Moore always spoke perfect grammatical English and as far as I could judge so did this LR. Tonto's original horse was piebald and at least by the time we get to the end of the film it had arrived.I did put a spoiler alert at the opening of this but anyone who is in any doubt about this LR being what he needs to be, be in no doubt, he doesn't kill anyone deliberately and his whole creed is about Justice.The final 20 minutes of the film with a lot of perfectly acceptable CGI help was absolutely superb and I will definitely be going back to see it all again and be ordering the blue ray as soon as possible. Ignore the critics and enjoy a highly entertaining movie.",The Lone Ranger
304,Sophoclaw,Fantastic work by Johnny Depp!,10,13 November 2018,"Format: Blu-ray
I have read and heard many bad reviews about this film, so I decided to see it for myself and give it a try. And I must say I don't regret it. It is not the usual western, it's funny! It's more like a comedy in a western costume because it has all the ingredients, bandits, native americans, chinese, silver mines, heroes, villains, beautiful women and of course The Lone Ranger and not to forget Tonto! whose presence makes the film with Johnny Depp playing the role in a most magnificent manner. One can wonder, there has been many films about these two caracters and no one has ever had this fantastic concept of Tonto.

305,tombiddy87,One fun filled train ride,7,18 August 2013,"People can be forgiven for feeling annoyed that the rebirth of The Lone Ranger is more a Tonto origins story where Jonny Depp steals the lime light from Armie Hammer who portrays the Lone Ranger himself but it is done well. The story is told by a elderly Tonto to a boy at a Western exhibition. The story starts off with Tonto who is traveling to Colby as a prisoner. John Reid (who will later become the Lone Ranger himself) is a young lawyer determined to bring justice to the world. John ends up befriending Tonto but their friendship is strained at times since they both have a different opinion on the meaning of justice. They must learn to work together if their to stop outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner).Johnny Depp is in his element as Tonto. He reminds you of other roles such as Jack Sparrow but with deeper meaning to his personality. Armie Hammer's performance is fine but he's always seems to be playing second fiddle to Depp. The rest of the casting was well placed. A couple of characters such as Madame (Bonham-Carter) served little purpose and were more a novelty but they brought entertainment all the same.This film brings a welcome change as many recent western attempts have fallen short, such as Cowboys and Aliens and it has the fun factor which all action movies should give. The return of the classic theme tune from the original TV series was a added bonus.The Lone Ranger may struggle to get a sequel since it is so different to anything the younger generation has seen before but studios have been know to give even movies which struggle in the box office a second chance so only time will tell.",The Lone Ranger
306,americanentertainmentrep,"The Lone Ranger Rides, but Tonto Steals the Show",8,7 July 2013,"Rating: 3 out of FordyceI knew going into ""The Lone Ranger"" that the only reason the studio made it was because Johnny Depp agreed to play Tonto, which was a wise move. The latest big screen adaptation of the legend of the outlaw lawman with a score to settle was quite a lot of fun. Armie Hammer is John Reid, the squeaky clean, back-East-educated district attorney who takes a post as prosecutor in his hometown in Texas. He rides out with a posse of rangers to get the bad guys. When the others, including his brother, are killed he becomes the Lone Ranger and discovers a plot of deception and greed. He stumbles onto Tonto and the adventures begin.Hammer is OK as the LR, but it is Johnny Depp as Tonto who steals the show. Depp, as usual, becomes the character and does it oh so well. The cool part of this movie, and what makes it different from the past adaptations, is that this time we hear the story from the Indian himself. This is done with Depp as an old Tonto flashing back as he tells the story. He should get an Oscar just for playing older Tonto alone, but deserves it for the rest of his performance, as well.The rest of the cast fits in nicely, and the end of the movie, although predictable, is lots of fun. Silver is there with his almost magical qualities as the great white horse, and we have the music that we expect as a spot-on arrangement of the ""William Tell Overture"" gets us to the end. This one gets a good 3 out of Fordyce, and I am not sure why it did not do better at the box office opening weekend. I recommend you go see it next weekend and enjoy some escapist fun. Credit Check:Although the film is set up for a sequel, and I will welcome a chance to see Depp as Tonto again, there is nothing after the credits, but stay for them.

307,harbingerofapocalypse,"Good, fun western. Bad Lone Ranger.",7,28 December 2013,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and not even due to lowered expectations. I honestly don't think I'd have felt cheated if I had paid to see it in the theater.I think most of the complaints about it were due to expectations around the mythology. This was really not a very good Lone Ranger film at all. If they had just called it something else and named the characters differently I think it would have done so much better and maybe they would have been able to create that second Depp/Verbinski franchise that will now never happen.It was silly in spots (Depp jumps from a moving train about 2 stories down onto another moving train into a car filled with silver ore nuggets, lands without breaking a bone and rolls over the rocks without a bruise or scratch), but I think the trailers made it plain that this wasn't going to be very serious. It did its job. Was it justifiable to spend over $200 mil on it? No. But it thoroughly satisfied the crowd at our post Christmas get-together.Give it a chance and forget that it's about the Lone Ranger (which isn't really hard) and you'll enjoy.",The Lone Ranger
308,Marco_AGJ,Worth watching,6,30 July 2013,"I'm not entirely sure if I remember this right, but the main difference between this plot and the Pirates of the Caribbean one is that this one seems a little too overdone, somewhat infantile at times, but solid nonetheless. Of course the Pirates movie also had that teen vibe attached to it during the whole ride, but this one seems to take it to a whole new level.I'm not one of those scum that try to find holes in movies, they're movies not documentaries, but something when something exceeded even what is entirely normal at movies the final result tends to suffer. Riding a horse on top of a train, I'm all up for that, but managing to avoid certain death by squeezing yourself and the horse through the train gap and safely end up inside the train is extreme.The part where the ranger hits a last single bullet on horseback directly at the pistol of some guy over the train is another example. This is fantasy taken too far.But overall the movie had its share of comedy and adventure that should suffice for anyone not too bugged by these extreme moments, moments of awkwardness I'm sure, but understandable. What is most impressive about it in the end are the settings and general production. I'm sure the budged wasn't that limited but still they did an amazing job, with solid performances all around.",The Lone Ranger

310,deetya,A good movie with tainted roots.,6,20 May 2014,"I am a fan of Depp and Verbinski, and their films have been very enjoyable, to say the least.However, I'm unable to enjoy this one fully. The story was good, the special effects decent, Depp's performance sterling as usual. But there was a feeling like a fly in the ointment, a pebble in the shoe, a pea under the mattress, a bug in the chili.I realized it's the casting a Depp, a Caucasian, in the role of the Native American.Imagine if Laurence Fishburne donned whiteface when playing Perry White in ""Man of Steel."" He would talk the stereotypical way a white man talks (at least according to him). When he talks, he would move his body a certain way, point his fingers as certain way, in a way that he says white people move. He walks or shuffles a certain way, and he says that's how white people walks.Or what if Tyler Perry applied white make up and played Thor. And he would speak the way Chris Hemsworth did, and imitated how Hemsworth moved, as he talked and fought and kissed Natalie Portman.That's what's wrong with this movie. It's the poison at the root of the tree, so to speak. That's the little thing that made the movie stumbled, the little thing that irritated the audience and prevented them from fully enjoying this movie. Are the filmmakers saying that non-Caucasian actors are so stupid and incompetent that they have to be subbed by a White actor? Because that's what the filmmaker are (maybe inadvertently) saying.The work-around is actually very simple. instead of a White actor playing a Native American, have the character Tonto be a John Dunbar-(Dances with Wolves) type character. In the past, he met, saved, and trusted two runaway soldiers who seemed to willing to go native too. Unfortunately they returned his trust by killing off Tonto's tribe, thus setting off his quest for revenge.By having the character be a reformed white person, it offsets the racism inherent in Depp's casting.I'm not a scriptwriter, a filmmaker, or even in the film industry. And I could think of a work-around while the filmmakers couldn't? Then the filmmakers were either very stupid or very full of White-privilege.Another problem is that John Reid was an idiot. He was a rigid, dogmatic, bumbling, stumbling idiot. His outright refusal of a gun, without stopping to consider the region and situation, was what helped Butch Cavendish to escape, who in turn killed John Reid's brother. His returning Red's pussycat enabled the mob to catch up to him. During the shootout at the barn, he was useless, even though he had a pistol and Tonto only had a knife.Yet the film is so very fawning of Reid. He was appointed to be the hero by the Powers That Be of the Hereafter, who sent the white horse specifically for him. Tonto tried to steer the white horse to his capable brother, yet the white horse insisted. Reid hits Tonto with a shovel to stop him from shooting a fellow White man, even if that White man is an evil one. Speaking of hitting with a shovel, Reid hits Tonto with a shovel, yet Tonto still comes back to save him. Why would a Native American character always help a Caucasian character, even when that Caucasian character commits violence against the Native American one? The film could've gone the standard way. After the valley ambush, Tonto was surprised by Reid suddenly coming to, and knocked him out with a rock. The filmmakers could've continued and have Reid be the sole survivor of the ambush who decided to avenge his brother. But then they brought in the white horse which specifically chose Reid to be ""resurrected""? Why? To show how special he is? And why is he so special? Because he has no tan to his skin? Reid could have been written as having capabilities similar to his brother, only he chooses to concentrate on law. Instead, in the film he's just a bumbling doofus who got to be a hero due to divine intervention. A special guy, especially appointed by a Higher Power, to be the hero. Not Tonto, who had knowledge and abilities of his own, but this paleface bumbler doofus Americanus Idioticus.A case of the filmmaker's white privilege spilling over onto the screen? Or perhaps is it a matter of Armie Hammer being a bad actor. The Wikipedia page said Reid is supposed to be a ""young Jimmy Steward character."" Jimmy Stewart's character(s) had earnestness, Reid was stiff, inflexible, dogmatic. Jimmy Stewart's characters was shucks, golly-gee, Reid was idiotic. Stewart's character(s) had dignity. Reid had none.Native Americans in the movie also got a lousy deal in this movie. Their role, in the film, is nothing else but to be the victims of slaughter. Tonto's tribe? Slaughtered. Tonto's other tribe? Slaughtered too.The filmmakers could've ameliorated the destiny of the Native Americans. For example, instead of having the Charge of the Lightly-Armed Indians be a desperate, no-options-left, futile gesture, it could've been a tactical diversion to draw the Cavalry away from the rest of the tribe, to enable the women, children and rear-guard warriors to slip away to safety. Of course, at the end, as the silver crushes Cavendish, the surviving members of the tribe could be shown enjoying Tonto's revenge.Like I said, I've always enjoyed Depp and Verbinski's works. However, in this case, it may be that their overblown sense of privilege poisoned this movie from the get-go.",The Lone Ranger

A Disney movie, high production, and actors weight like Johnny Depp? I'm not a fanatical fan of Johnny Depp but I generally like his movies. So, ""what could go wrong?"" I thought.My Jesus, I really hate this movie! I mean, the film tries to be everything - tries to be funny, epic, dramatic, tries to outline a novel, but it does not seem to be a genuine western movie. Worse than that, it does not remember anything the characters Lone Ranger and Tonto. It's as if they had created two totally different characters, but with the same names.Lone Ranger here is a complete moron, made a fool all the time and an annoyingly politically-correct character. The film was supposed to be about him, but he did not have charisma enough to be the protagonist, and is fully eclipsed by Johnny Depp.But if Johnny Depp steals every scene as Tonto, even your character annoyed me. What the heck they did with Tonto in this film? What the heck was that stuffed bird? True Tonto was not a lunatic or a madman. He was not dressed in flashy clothes.In this film, Tonto is not a real Native American, he is literally Jack Sparrow tired of the pirate life that moved to the West and changed its name to Tonto.And what about the villains? All, without exception, seem pirates of the caribbean dressed in cowboy clothes, which fell parachutes in the west. The unique character of this film that seems to have brain is the Horse, and if the most intelligent character in a western story is an animal, this mean there are problems.The plot is a spectacular mess, jumping from action scenes, to violent and heavy scenes, for children's jokes, for really trash moments. What the heck was the scene with the rabbits? And what was that scene with the character of Helena B. Carter shoots with a gun inside the boot? Worthy scenes to appear in any show or film of Seth MacFarlane no doubt.I mean, really? What this film aims to be? An epic western for adults, an Disney movie for kids or a parody trash like ""A Million Ways to Die in the West""? They should have chosen only one of these alternatives, because join all this in a quilt does not work.This film is a complete bullshit. I lost almost three hours of my life that no longer return.

Sweeney Todd, Willy Wonka, The Mad Hatter, even the return of him as Hunter S Thompson.. taking into account his first rendition made it one of my favourite films... but nope.I didn't even like Jack Sparrow past the second film.So I went against my gut to see this movie after the advert just looked like he's playing the same old ""aren't I so weird and silly"" character in new scenery... And he is! Seems like he's under contractual obligation by Disney and Burton to always remain the same.But it isn't as bad as I expected...It is Pirates of the Caribbean in the wild West. The characters and plot are very similar, with smelly ugly rotten meanies and shiny toothed American do-gooder who teams up with convict to bring justice and save the girl he fancies from the clutches of previously mentioned meanies... Yes, quite quite similar.Not a quarter as good as Pirates of the Caribbean, which I saw as a teen four times in the cinema. It's certainly not worth writing off, though... I can't see why there's so much animosity towards this movie.It is a bit long and a bit depressing. Not a single Native American we meet lives apart from Tonto. It is pretty brutal in that respect and maybe there aren't enough good laughs to lighten it. Some of the silly Depp moments are cringe-worthy as I expected, like when he puts the bird cage on his head... eeuugh Still, no need to condemn it.

The sad part is that it takes down what could have been its saving grace – a subversively funny Johnny Depp who plays Tonto, the Ranger's Indian sidekick turned mentor, as a means to explode every cliché of the American Indian ever cooked up by racist, ""me scalp-em-white man"" Hollywood.Unfortunately, this two-and-a-half hour obstacle course of cinematic horse turds resists redemption even from Depp. Harsh critics insist it's the film's tonal shifts that destroy it. Ha! Can you imagine a group of nine-year-olds bitching about ""tonal shifts""? The fatal flaw in Jerry Bruckheimer's monumentally monotonous production is that it forgets it's duty to entertain. Director Gore Verbinski, working from a DOA script by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio and Justin Haythe, keeps trying to show how much smarter he is than a filmmaker who would simply wallow in tradition. He and Depp did a better job of that in the animated Rango. Here they're just putting Pirates of the Caribbean in a saddle and pretending we won't notice. Burn.There's a big action scene involving a train. Then another one. Then a ton more of exposition, about how Tonto and the masked man buddy up. But, in truth, they hardly do. Hammer and Depp never develop a rapport. This is Tonto's show. But when you've seen one scene of a Native American conning a dumb white dude, you've seen them all. When the rousing William Tell Overture (the Lone Ranger theme on radio and TV) finally thunders on the soundtrack, you're too pummeled to care. Captain Jack Sparrow would have swanned away from this dullness the first chance he got. But Tonto, the noble savage, has to stay and represent. Don't make the same mistake.",The Lone Ranger
316,Whiskey-Jack,"The critics got this one right. In a word, this movie stinks.",1,19 December 2013,"I rented this on my cable channel last night after missing it in the theatres. The good thing about that is I didn't waste as much on the rental fee as I would have on a theatre ticket. For all of its hype, this movie is a prime example of silliness. The weak screenplay, terrible dialogue and cheap directing are exceeded only by sophomoric attempts at humour. This movie can't make up its mind whether it wants to be deadly serious - a man is gutted with a knife and his heart torn out - or childishly amusing as in fearsome carnivorous cartoon rabbits. Please. This is a poor attempt at copying the much better made and better acted Antonio Banderas/Anthony Hopkins ""Zorro"" format; evil landowner exploiting the peasants for a treasure, the hero coming to the aid of the oppressed, comedy relief interspersed with heavy drama with the exception that in the Lone Ranger the comedy relief is embarrassingly juvenile and made at the expense of the main character's credibility. Verbinsnki has reduced the Lone Ranger's character to a dandified, overly-naive idealist better suited for the tastes of immature fans of animation film. The action shots are ludicrous. One of the most absurd is our hero at full gallop catching a silver bullet tossed to him from a speeding train. Better yet, he gallops his horse through the train cars while chasing down the villain. Verbinski's pièce de resistance is the Lone Ranger riding Silver on top of the moving train. Verbinski's interpretation and mistreatment of a classic tale falls into the category criminally negligent. Depp, obviously in need, took the money and ran. So did my cable company.",The Lone Ranger
317,PedroRosRod,Highly recommended for all audiences,9,21 July 2013,"""The Lone Ranger"" highly met my expectations being a Jhonny Depp adventure movie.Having that in mind, I went to the theater not wanting to have Academy awards performances but lots of fun. All the main characters delivered what the movie was demanding: Most of the actors did a decent characterization of their roles, though the kid underperformed a little bit. Lots of funny moments coming from either the clumsy Armie Hammer's character or Tonto's sarcastic comments. It definitely has a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" feel in the way Jhonny Depp delivers his jokes, but it manages to keep you on your seat during the entire 149 minutes it lasts. It's highly watchable.",The Lone Ranger
318,scherfcom,Disappointing and boring,5,6 July 2013,"Well, based on the trailer and with Johnny Depp in it I had somewhat great expectations. After the letdown of ""The Great Gatsby"" several weeks ago, I was hoping that ""The Lone Ranger"" would be a pleasant surprise. Sadly, it was yet another letdown, and in fact after about an hour and ten minutes I walked out of the theater, ... I didn't want to waste more time for this. So it was a disappointment and basically this flick was boring. Also the beginning was a bit uncoordinated and somewhat just scenes put together with either over thinking it or without putting too much thought into it, ... meaning the editing wasn't very good.And about the laughs? Hmmmmmm, ... other than a smile here or there, nothing really witty or really funny, ... let's say most of the stuff was contrived.Seems like that for years now Hollywood isn't able to produce anything worth watching. While I used to go to the movies every week, I'm now down to maybe one or two flicks a year, ... nothing is really worth my time anymore as much as I want to enjoy a movie at least once in a while.",The Lone Ranger

Of course, the movie presents the same revenge background common to this sort of film but it's so much more than that: - Great visuals, lots of thrilling scenes, chases, cowboys and all that.Johny Depp is great, a bit ""Sparrowy"" as Tonto and his lines sometimes serve as the entry points for what I thought the best thing in this movie - the widely surreal feel brought by the mighty horse cameos.

320,gvzfs,No No No,2,7 October 2013,"Even as a fantasy western this goes way beyond the point of good consistent entertainment. It isn't funny to have a massacre one moment then a comic relief over the top two train chase. Too much spirit walk and talk and frankly uninteresting plot leading in. Yes it's full of references, and for that you at least get to go ah once in a while, but the over all experience is that of tired re-usage of plot characters well established elsewhere and a few moments of oh that is just plain silly. I do love westerns and for me they are the ultimate in road movie meets the use of straight and true narrative build up with slow strong scenes that build on the rough and unforgiving nature of the first settlers and their encounter with nature the competing rivalry from old and new. Here the rivalry is between keeping it comedy or action.",The Lone Ranger

Rewatch it, but ask yourself why is Tonto in the ""museum"" - there were no actual museums in 1930, but circuses and freakshows - that did exist. As well as reservations. While freakshows are not anymore a thing, if you ignore the social media - that is, reservations and racism are. And the kid and his last scene symbolizes hope that we will overcome that ugly stain on humanity. That's what the kid (new generation) should kill with that bullet, as a figure of speech. This movie is deep. This movie has scenes that will make you cry, if you think about them. But it will make you laugh as well.Do yourself a favor and watch it with your brain ON.

322,woodiphora,Good fun with a sound cast,7,17 October 2013,"I don't know what people expect from a movie to give it such a mediocre score. This is plain good fun. My wife and I laughed a lot. Somewhere along the lines of the original Lone Ranger, but with a lot more humour, and increasingly outrageous set pieces. Some of the horse stunts later in the movie were quite ridiculous, but by that stage one just didn't worry about it too much.Depp's Tonto is a thinly veiled Jack Sparrow, just older and grumpier, and a pleasure to watch. The Ranger himself was nicely played, and the horse deserves an Oscar.Criticisms: (1) Too much over the top action in the opening scenes. I thought, 'oh no' at that point, and was expecting a poorly scripted and dull action flick, thankfully I was wrong, and things improved as things progressed. (2) The ending scene is a bit overworked, maybe. I felt the director should have had more faith his work and let it stand as it was. (3) So many people shot dead! OK, it's a movie, but this soured it a little for me. There's no harm in a good few 'air punches' and shot-in-the-shoulder-and-stooping-with-a-groan type of 'violence'. Why the need in modern movies to have so much casual violence? Lost a point here, otherwise 8/10. I'd have been uncomfortable taking a child to it.Can't see a sequel, but if there is one the appeal would be to see Depp going through his paces again. Good set pieces, please, less violence, please, please, please.",The Lone Ranger
323,starwolf,"An enjoyable movie, worth seeing - but there is a ""been there, seen that"" feel to it",7,11 November 2013,"I finally saw The Lone Ranger. I saw it on a airline flight - so not the best venue, I agree. On the other hand, there's nothing like a captive audience. It's not a bad movie at all. It's enjoyable to watch, and then quite forgettable afterward. My issue with the movie is that it plays like Pirates of the Caribbean in the Old West. It's by the same people, so perhaps you would expect the humor and the over the top stunts to be the same, and if so you'd be right. Well, when I say the same, I don't mean there is sword fighting on top of a giant wheel. But the big stunts could have been lifted from POTC, and the humor is played exactly the same. That in and of itself isn't bad, but it lends a ""been there, seen that"" feeling to the movie. Depp's Tonto isn't exactly Captain Jack Sparrow, but I don't think you can argue that it's completely unlike him either. Depp is a good actor - I just think he lets his love of dress up and heavy makeup do his acting for him, sometimes. That's the same issue I had with his Barnabus Collins in Dark Shadows. As a baseline, I loved the first POTC, the second one was ""okay,"" I really didn't like the third one and never saw the fourth one. Also, I am a huge Lone Ranger fan - I am from the generation where the Lone Ranger was Clayton Moore and Tonto was Jay Silverheels. I got to meet Jay Silverheels one time as a very young lad, and it was a highlight of my single-digit years. Having said that, I am willing to give someone else a chance behind the mask, and Armie isn't bad at all - although I don't entirely care for the wimpy characterization they started him off with. I know, I know, they did it to throw his heroic conversion into contrast. I think the best explanation of the movie is one proposed by another poster - it's a story told years later to a little kid by Tonto, exaggerated to make Tonto's role in the whole thing bigger and over the top. I was surprisingly okay with that. On the whole, not the best movie I have seen in a while, but better than almost any Michael Bay movie and worth seeing once.",The Lone Ranger
324,ishtapaz,Disappointing - Pair De,4,5 July 2013,"I saw this movie last might and my 12 year old son and my wife. We are Depp fans even before Disney made him big and very rich. But in spite of our rose tinted glasses from Depp love this film is disappointing, very...First of all what was the point of old Tonto and the boy dialogs, too much and lost its effect after the third scene. Also in the closing title scene, even though Armie may have been paid a pittance compared to Depp, credit him in the same line as Depp. Tonto means stupid in Spanish although Tonto in Potowami means wild one but the Potowamis are in Michigan/WisconsinNative American sensibilities. I have been reading a lot of blogs about this and first I though it was just bitterness from some very jealous people. Not really. The dead raven as a headgear is very insulting and the explanation came very much later. Comanches were mostly in Oklahoma, plains people not in Utah.In this globalized market where many films use a non English dialogue sometimes even not subtitled, why not let Depp monologues be in Comanche? Instead of the insulting pidgin English or be representative of how Native Americans speak English today.In the action and fantasy department this one even with a quarter billion budget fell short. If you are riding on the coattails of the Pirate franchise you need to deliver on that as well.Comedy --- okay Depp made me laugh, but many times it is on the expense of Native American stereotyping. Only two women with a maybe 10 lines max and Ruth Wilson lips had so much botox it looked hideous. Really botox in the 1800's?The Comanche back story really fell short. Either completely make something up or tell the truth. I think in this day and age, you cannot really tell of the native American Indian tragedies and whitewash the pain. The Lone Ranger character build up was also half-done and the self realization of who he was came very late in the movie. I mean the movie should show some Lone Ranger bad-ass.I think if you want to retell this then you have to do it beyond the confines of a summer blockbuster but maybe something in the R rating.",The Lone Ranger

Do NOT compare this to the original series, you'll be disappointed.What was good? I loved the scenery, the sets, the dirt, the photography, the soundtrack, the special effects, and the humour.

Telling the story in the form of a series of flashbacks between a small boy and an aged Tonto (who might be a spirit, or not) was extremely annoying, and completely unnecessary.

And this movie deserves a 4 just for one reason: captain Jack Sparrow is playing the role of Tonto, and he is again annoying as he ever was. Why on earth is he spoiling yet another movie? Did he not do enough harm in the other movies? And what's with the ridiculous crow on his head? Classic movies had ""Indians"" with feathers, and they wore them with pride. But no, a few feathers are not good enough, why not go completely over the top and wear a stuffed dead bird? Also annoying was the role of the Lone Ranger, it vaguely reminded me of the ""hero"" from the Green Lantern. But he was less cringeworthy than Tonto.

The museum scenes are a bit too much for me, but it is good for the kids. The out of sequence bits work, partly because they aren't emphasized too much. Depp, as Tonto, craftily plays this with a subtle humor, and that is just what is needed for this.There is the magic and mystique of the Ranger, but also an explanation given for it, as ""Nature out of balance"". We are dealing with a supernatural chain of events which do allow the Lone Ranger to ride a horse through and on top of railroad cars.Great blend of humor and adventure, and at the same time a crafty blend of Shakespeare and Indiana Jones.

The terrible characterization and portrayal of Native Americans in this adaptation is cliché at best and terrible at worst.

Great actor who's been getting his character portrayals muddled as of late. Armie Hammer's performance in this film is nothing to write home about. This film is too long and it's not even worth it. I can't believe Disney sunk so much money into this film. It's John Carter all over again. Shouldn't have let myself get dragged to this movie. I heard it was pretty bad from several critics and people I know. The hearsay is correct, in my opinion. The critics got it completely right on this one, and I often disagree with them.

My hubby and I both agreed on this one and we both rate it 3 out of 10 (just for some of the effects).Be under no illusion, this is NOT a light hearted children's film - despite the occasional (failed) attempts at childish comedy.It is a confusing mish-mash of styles that jump between some seriously nasty scenes and inane, annoying, stupid 'humour'. It is full of anomalies which leave you frustrated and asking too many questions. Throw in a bunch of cute looking but vicious, carnivorous bunnies in the desert just for the sake of it, plus the stars and stripes flag flying in 1869! just to add to the confusion.The style of the story (i.e. it being told to a latter day child in the 1930s), means it is constantly jumping back and forward between the story unfolding and the relating of it to this boy. It is annoying and frustrating and spoils the flow of the film greatly. It also slows the film down and adds to the length - yes it is a long film.Like I said, some of the action and effects were good and they deserved to be in a much better film.

Lightweight fun with famous actors and plenty of action scenes, with enough historical context, to say that we have learned something. It was supposed to get a reality is quite the opposite. Of the movie with a budget of over two hundred million dollars, I expected, that it will pay more attention to the explosive effects and ensure that the scene be the fastest and most exciting. Based on the series, ""The Lone Ranger"" is about the unusual ""duo"" Indian Tonto (Johnny Depp) and John Reid (Armie Hammer), stuffy lawyer with naive notions of justice. Linked by the desire for revenge against the outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner), through which they will have to overcome mutual cultural differences and realize mutual similarities - they are both men. In the background is a broad historical truth. Centuries of injustice and atrocities by the Indians, cruel progress of Western civilization, this time through the construction of railways, the desire to appropriate the natural resources and creating a growing addiction. In the center of it all stems from human greed, all the greater as time goes on. At times is extremely witty and funny, I'd be lying to claim that regret for the lost time.",The Lone Ranger

I went in expecting that type of flavor, but if you think of it as a chili, it was a chili that had its spices out of balance but it wasn't a bad chili and was still edible. The thing with the kid would have been good as book-ends, I'm not sure how I feel about it being interjected into the story line periodically, although I suppose it shows us that an over one-hundred- year-old (ghost?) man is not the most reliable narrator. Do I regret paying $7.50 to go see it? No. Did I learn stuff from it about writing? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. I just feel that it could have been better.

But nothing spectacular. I really think this movie had potential to be much better than it turned out to be if it didn't have so much of a 'cartoonish', too simple feel to it, the main character is a 'Pure Hearted' cliché Hero with a very basic set of principles, starts as a wimp, gains invincibility and then acts like a hero, surviving whatever and doing as he likes as things explode around him. The 'villian' in this is also a very simple character, a pure bad character that's just greedy, evil, does not act with any reason, and rather dumb. He even gives a speech a few times when he can just kill the hero.. earning time for things to happen, like classic cartoon villains showing off their brilliant plan thus letting the hero slip away, which I find really lame. And there's the damsel in distress that falls that is in love with the hero and Johnny Depp for some comedy.So .. in conclusion I think this isn't a bad movie and is worth a watch if you're bored, especially for children.

I had so much fun watching this film and the last 30 minutes are amazing entertainment. What surprised me about this film is how dark it got at some points. Cannibalism, massacres, scalpings, etc was very unexpected in a Disney blockbuster vehicle. Armie hammer is serviceable in the leading role if a little bland. This is firmly Depp's show through and through. The films running time is felt however and could've been trimmed by 30 minutes at least but it's not too bad. The films framing device of old Tonto could and should've been snipped entirely as it grinds everything to a screeching halt. But besides that, this is fun spectacle. It's a shame the excellent Ruth Wilson didn't appear more than she does. Absolutely beautiful and brilliant actress (watch The Affair and Mrs. Wilson for further proof of that).

337,southbase,Yes it's fun but too long and not your Grandpa's Lone Ranger,6,14 July 2013,"Grimy, gently clownish yet brazenly epic interpretation of the old 'Lone Ranger' radio/TV shows featuring Johnny Depp now as its central character Tonto is difficult to ridicule or take for granted, even when the film doesn't seem to be sure exactly whose story it's retelling. Even with the efforts of Depp to bring a pained, highly exotic mystery to his role as a 1933 stuffed Indian museum exhibit brought to life by a little boy wondering what happened to the actual Lone Ranger, the film's antic, myth-busting cruelty almost begins working against itself and doesn't very firmly place itself behind either him (as he first relates what seems to be a bogus bank robbery using our heroes) or the newly-arrived Old West attorney John Reid (Armie Hammer), originally recruited by his Texas Ranger brother Dan to help hunt down the dastardly Butch Cavendish and his gang but is instead double-crossed by one of their own men and mistakenly left for dead after the others are killed. The film up until this point is decently faithful to the original George Trendle-/Jack Wrather-created media treatments that--admittedly fired up by the post-WWII pro-U.S. bent imposed upon American comics and juvenile action characters--made for a rather stoic, multi-principled Western icon (almost a living civil constitution legal form wearing a fringed leather rider's outfit, although the character's best known screen interpreter, Clayton Moore, along with his own Tonto Jay Silverheels, made the character cool). Director Gore Verbinski's decisively widescreen & sturdy if unilluminating scene stagings (Sam Peckinpah and Anthony Mann proved the overall camera setup for a character-driven Western showdown is always a little harder to accomplish than it looks) appear to promise a much more ribald & earthy Ranger adventure (support actors here such as Helena Bonham Carter, Saginaw Grant, and the intentionally-repulsive yet uncampy William Fichtner as Cavendish get right into the spirit of it), and for a time during the film's episode-stuffed 70-minute midsection swerving between the plights of immigrants, Comanches, wounded pioneer women (Reid's topsy-turvy widowed love interest portrayed by Ruth Wilson has a real feminine decency that survives all the rather startling amount of economic and political subtexts the character is expected to react to, almost as if the relationship was undergoing constant rewrites all through shooting) and a seemingly corrupt railroad magnate (Tom Wilkinson)--it almost looks like the tersely-tempered Tonto will actually be able to make an iconic hero out of Reid. But the film's ultimately impersonal attempts at humor or John Ford-type sentiment seem to almost undercut the almost imperceptible attempts to recreate the revered, Arthurian-type bestowing of such gifts to the Ranger as resurrection, the discovery and taming of an almost mythic creature to assist in chasing criminals (there is not even a moment of Reid & Tonto riding their horses alongside each other at high-speed firing their pistols at a target; the characters instead generally clod into towns together on the same horse as if in some 1980s buddy comedy), or the use of the mask and silver bullets to frighten Cavendish and intimidate his backers. The trouble does not appear to stem from Mr. Hammer as the Lone Ranger exactly; his gently beefcake Ryan Reynolds-type looks, somewhat too-wiry build, sharpened character inner drive (he at least makes the increasingly Jerry Bruckheimer-level screen mayhem including train crashes and railroad car fights tense and exciting), and accepting comic trades against Mr. Depp are not light achievements in themselves. But since the Lone Ranger is basically a 19th century form of haunting law-enforcing zombie, and cannot ultimately deal with temporal issues such as sexual romance & monetary award, the part almost requires a quiet, Gary Cooper-type reversive approach, emphasizing historical probity, the dedication to restoring assurance in a community to live and prosper by startling self-honesty, and a type of gently mischievous but observable contempt for seams in the art of rule-breaking. In this--as the film finally hurdles towards its hugely financed and publicized railroad chase so that Reid & Tonto can more settle an overwrought private grievance against Cavendish (or with the rail magnate and a blindly-led U.S. military officer, it is a little hard to keep track of) instead of uniting an evolving and newly-gifted portion of frontier America (Hans Zimmer's climactic use here of the legendary William Tell/Lone Ranger-theme Overture does at least skillfully try to reinforce this almost abandoned story angle)--THE LONE RANGER is totally recommendable for giving a fictional Western hero a giant, silver-nitrate-tinted, raw stage to play out on; it just isn't more highly rateable in its final form here for making John Reid, Tonto, and many of its own characters too much of uneven, carnival-type CGI-action sideshow attractions together (like THE AVENGERS set in 1870) instead of something more simply feeling and determinedly emotional at the same time.",The Lone Ranger

There is good action, great scenery (Monument Valley) good characters and so many dead pan funny lines, just some of the subtle looks from Depp as Tonto, is all you need to make you laugh. I could describe it as a bit of Laurel & Hardy'ish humour.
I think it's very underrated & I've now seen it a few times & I love it more. A few times, I've known it to be on & switch over and think I'll just watch this bit, but each time I can't help but end up watching it all.
I recommend it, thoroughly enjoyable.",The Lone Ranger

All those aspects are in this The Lone Ranger movie. This movie is not bad, this movie is entertaining both to western movies genre lover and Johnny Depp's fans. Don't expect this movie to be really serious as Django Unchained. When there is a Johnny Depp in a movie, never expect that movie to be serious.Typical Johnny Depp movies (Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in Wonderland, etc.). Hilarious jokes, eccentric acting and appearance. What else can you expect from Johnny Depp? His acting is not so brilliant here but it's enough to make us burst laughing.The movie itself has a quite long duration, 2.5 hours. I think this movie will be really bored but I was wrong. All the scenes in this movie are amazing and the landscapes shots are awesome. So wild west.Conclusion, this movie is enjoyable. Great action, hilarious, funny Lone Ranger and Tonto's conversations, 2.5 hours will be nothing.",The Lone Ranger
341,superwomanproductions,Excellent Experience,9,25 June 2013,"Once again Disney, Bruckheimer and Depp make for an excellent movie experience. When you watch a television show in black and white growing up, you don't always know what to expect as an adult to see it as a feature length film. I enjoyed this movie tremendously. The storytelling and writing was excellent. The fact that Lone Ranger isn't a ""Disney character"" meant that I had no other reference but the television show to go on. This is one you have to pay attention to. Don't get up in the middle to get a refill on your popcorn because you may very well miss part of the story. Depp plays an older tormented Tonto sharing his experiences meeting the Lone Ranger with a young boy who attends the local carnival. And so the story begins. The element of greed in American history and what it can influence people to do is closely examined throughout the film. Therefore you get entertainment and a lesson and it's cleverly written so that even young adults will get it. No need to explain how dad and granddad use to watch it in black and white back in the day. This is one of the better ""reboots"" of the summer.",The Lone Ranger
342,raynaking0,It was actually really good!,9,10 August 2013,I read some reviews on it and wasn't too excited to see it (even after a year long wait!) I was so surprised! I thought the acting was good and the plot was excellent. It was really funny too. I wouldn't suggest bringing young children though! Its not really your run of the mill Disney movie. I don't usually watch movies about cowboys and Indians but this one was really good! Johnny Depp was amazing as always and Armie Hammer was fantastic too. I went with my brother and fiancé and they also thought it was really good. I thought the plot twist was really well played. I didn't even see it coming. I will definitely be buying this on DVD when it becomes available. Bravo Disney Bravo!:),The Lone Ranger
343,SaintedSons,Adding Ego To Insult,6,24 March 2018,"I was thrilled when I read there was actually going to be a new, big-budget Lone Ranger film, especially since the last attempt at this franchise failed so badly. However, I was a little reluctant when I also read that Johnny Depp was to portray Tonto. Don't get me wrong, he's an exceptional actor BUT, he's also very eccentric.Your first sign of trouble is when ""Tonto"" gets top billing over the lead, not good. If you are thinking about watching this movie-don't. I tried every which way to like this movie and just flat out couldn't. ""Tonto"" practically spends the entire movie making the ""Lone Ranger"" look like a complete idiot. There's nothing romantic about the movie or anything that made us love this classic hero and his faithful sidekick, which, by the way, this movie centers around. This was obviously ego-driven. Adding insult to injury, the movie lost millions. There are some good moments, the story has potential, but every time there seemed to be a chance the movie would get better throughout, it took a turn for the worse. It insulted the legacy of this beloved character(Lone Ranger), it also insulted my intelligence.",The Lone Ranger
344,ioannites,A good film with some weakness,7,16 September 2013,"Movies western left well their marks in the history of the cinema. Even if we are not any more in the 50s and 60, this genre continues to evolve and we find movies in our days which resume the style of the big movies or the others who try to modify them. The movie Lone Ranger, Birth of a hero of Gore Verbinski is a western movie nowadays which takes back American television series of the years 1949-1959 and by hinting at Zorro. If this movie is characterized by a number of weaknesses, it cannot prevent us from considering it as a good movie which carries a considerable valuable number in our time. Beginning with the positive points of this work, we intend to examine the structure of its argument. Following the example of some critics which blame the naivety of its story, we aim to be to underline the back flash of this story. The return thus of this story in the 20s allows on one hand the spectator to rest because the structure is very complex and on the other hand to comment on the events of this story. The latter and forward the corruption of the American society and here, we have to underline also the courage of the director, because the European movies often avoid criticizing historic facts of their societies. The presence of the Indian creates a poetic dimension in this movie because we do not have to ignore the mythological aspects which are expressed by this character. Besides this scenario makes us feel positive values such as the brotherhood, the solidarity, the justice, the friendship and others. Other positive elements which we have to evoke it are the beauty of the images with a dominant color: the yellow. The music also is rich and varied adapted well to the argument of the scenario. If this movie has a considerable number of positive points, our opinion would be incomplete if we did not underline its weak points. Thus let us begin with the irony which does not go with this whole story. It is about a caricature which destabilizes well the spectator who prevents him from understanding all the positive values. If the back flash of this movie is originality, however, the presence of the Indian in the fair is badly explained and maybe too naive for this work. The movie Lone Ranger, is a reference for movies western recent in spite of its weaknesses",The Lone Ranger
345,gmonger,The origin of the legend of the Lone Ranger,9,4 September 2014,"What exactly is so wrong with this movie? All I have heard is that it is bad, really bad. Well, I don't agree. It is a normal ""actioneer"", with all the fiction and fantastically , impossible, stunts that many , nearly all, of it's genre contain. Why hate this over any other modern movie? This is a comic book hero story , it is allowed to be be over the top.First and foremost, the movies of today in general are of excellent quality in terms of all the technical aspects. They are shot beautifully, great DPs , costumes, the actors are authentic, there isn't a category where they miss. Bad movies are bad from inception. Why did they do a story like this in the first place? It never should have gotten past the treatment phase. Or the script is bad or too preachy or agenda filled. That is the problem with modern films, not in the actual making of the movie. There is no problem here with The Lone Ranger. It is a nicely shot movie with some great faces, good script, and realistic looking backgrounds including all the western gear and accouterments. And a good storyline.In general, Depp is always worth it and this movie is no exception. He brings a great comic relief to the movie. It has a nice balance of action, humor and realistic, fairly gory ( for Disney esp. ) scenes of evil depravity. It is a worthy plot and story about the inception and introduction of the two main, mythical, legendary figures, the Lone Ranger and Tonto.The cast is quite established and carries the movie perfectly, Helena Bonham-Carter, through to Tom Wilkerson, Barry Pepper and Armie Hammer. Butch Cavendush, played by William Fichtner, is one of the best bad guys ever, a really great character, behaving and looking as evil as can be. He and Depp make the film worthy by themselves.It may have thrown the public off that the LR was a pacifist in the beginning and not really a hero type and perhaps for too long into the movie. It was not my favorite aspect of the interpretation of the LR's origins. That being said , the Lone Ranger is a classic actioneer of the comic book genre. Comics are hard to bring to the screen properly. There is a balance that must be struck, they are from, based, on comics, so they are going to be fantastic, maybe more so than the norm. But they have to be realistic, because that realism carries better , it can't be as silly as the real comics. Most do this well. From X-Men, to the Spider Man trilogy to Marvel's The Avengers, perfect examples of this. All excellent comic book movies.So is the Lone Ranger.",The Lone Ranger

Tedious, boring, unimaginative, silly, overcooked yet underdone, and acting and dialogue like something witnessed in a bad junior high school play with an $25,000 budget, not 250 million. Worst, most ridiculous scene which we are supposed to take seriuosly---when the train wrecks with Jack Sparrow and the Wimp Ranger being thrown off, both tumble and tumble and tumble at 40 mph, slam against whatever and not a scratch on either of them, no torn clothes, no sprained joints, and that stupid magpie is still on the Indian's, I mean, pirate's head.

Iove the villian and just how dastardly he is, I love the heroes and how mismatched they are yet how perfectly they work together. And when it comes down toward the final battle and that lone ranger theme kicks in and the action starts and we get all the cheesy one liners, bullets start flying, things exploding, I still get goosebumps.

348,stowner-479-360153,Disneys Pirates as cowboys - nothing like the original Lone Ranger,3,25 August 2013,"Given my fond memories of the original characters, actors and series I thought this film might have a chance of being entertaining. Sadly, I was bored after about fifteen minutes and very bored after 30. Johnny Depps humour is more cute than funny and I didn't hear any adults laugh out loud. The film's depiction of the Lone Ranger as a complete idiot and a wimp was odd. If I had my time again I would arrive in time to watch the train crash sequence and then leave. The rest of the film is a series of irritatingly predictable scenes and inane dialogue. The film is about two hours too long.Go and see it by all means if you like Depps' ""Pirates"" series, as you will probably think this film is great.",The Lone Ranger
349,mcalester66,Why?,1,9 July 2013,"Having nothing else to do this summer, I went to see ""The Lone Ranger"" with the thought that maybe it would be good. Wrong, apparently.While Johnny Depp was up to his usual antics, he played Tonto masculine - that's a shocker. He had a few funny moments, including at the end when the lone ranger says ""Hi, ho, Silver!"" and Johnny Depp replies ""Never do that again."" Unfortunately, I found the movie exceedingly boring, like they TRIED to make it an action film. There was a lot of violence and a slight anti-gun theme, how the Lone Ranger witnesses Butch kill his brother and still says ""I can't shoot him"" and proceeds to drag him into the town for miles and drag out the movie.Helena Bonham-Carter once again disappointed me. Her performance was too put-on and her wooden leg-foot-gun thing was more steampunk than western. What? The film had a weak story, and The lone ranger's nephew and sister-in-law keep appearing randomly. Popping up was the term I used to discuss the film with my family.It's a pity because the Lone Ranger was such a good TV show too...3/10",The Lone Ranger
350,frankdistefano,"A fiasco, plain and simple",1,3 July 2013,"Being one of only ten people attending the first show at the huge Ziegfeld Theatre in New York should have been an omen. After the first reasonably entertaining 20 minutes, the movie went straight-to-Hell. An incoherent script, disappointingly mediocre cinematography never taking full advantage of what could have been spectacular western vistas, insensitive editing, and a central performance by Hammer who seemed to be imitating Brendan Fraser but failing by a mile,the movie was bereft of consistency, tone and style, not to mention humor. The movie was an interminable mess. Infuriating that what could have been a swift, straight-forward classic western with an intelligent script,turned out so wrong. If anyone associated with this fiasco might be thinking of a franchise, think again. A bloated bore.",The Lone Ranger

This movie bore no resemblance to the Clayton Moore, Lone Ranger of my youth, and Johnny Depp was even less familiar as Tonto. It was, however, a fun movie & Depp, as always, was very good. Clearly, the writing and acting were better than the original TV show,but for those of us who have fond memories of the characters portrayed by Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels, it was certainly a disappointment. As you can probably tell, I feel a lot of ambivalence about this movie, as I am torn between the new version and the nostalgia of the old version.

The story is, predictably, somewhat clichéd in essence but it has been given a good treatment and the humour and great characters and structure of the story allows the film to get away with this.The critics seem to have been unbelievably harsh about this film. I should think this film will become a regular Christmas favourite on television in the future. It is a real shame that the film has not done better at the box office as everyone involved deserves better.Thoroughly recommend this film.

The action finale is really wonderful and quite original so it does build up steam at the end but overall it's quite a laid back pace.",The Lone Ranger
354,seawolfvii,"Okay film, a little exciting, a little humorous and a lot lacking.",5,12 July 2013,"The writing, directing and producing failed. The acting probably failed because of the writing. Too much lean on past successes.I was hoping for a more grown-up version of the Lone Ranger. More the Wolverine of ""Origins"" not the Wolverine of ""The X-men"". More like the Dark Knight series as opposed to the 90's Batman blunders. What I was hoping for was darker or serious perhaps, with a little more substance. What I got...an incompatible mix of Inspector Gadget, Wild Wild West, Deputy Dog and the Indian from Bugs Bunny cartoons (the doofus Indian not little Hiawatha).5 stars, 3 of which are for cinematography, 1 is for the horse and the actors, writers, producers and directors can share the last star.******* Spoiler Alert ******** Didn't like the narration, Princess Bride did it fairly well but Lone Ranger didn't. Too distracting.Anyone, if you want to reuse thematic ideas from other movies (the Jack Sparrow swinging from ropes) fine, but just clips! It took you 2 minutes of swinging from ropes to demonstrate your Pirates references that I got in 5 seconds. Overkill = under-enjoyed.I was hoping for a more grown-up version, not rated ""R"" but a darker, more serious Lone Ranger and Tonto. As it turns out the ""dark"" (PG-13) of Fitchner's character (and his goons) with the town and all the busty women mixed with the ""G"" rated Deputy Dog for the Lone Ranger and you fail. Yes I like Deputy Dog but not as the Lone Ranger. Epic Fail.Why not have the basics of the Lone Ranger theme song with modern variations? It's like they just cut-and-pasted the original theme into one part of the movie. I half-expected to hear the old scratch of a needle on vinyl...it was out of place and ineffective.And seriously with the horse jumps from buildings and trains? WTH? If I want magic flying horses I'll turn to Clash of the Titans (1981).Depp did fairly well I think. I liked the make-up though some movie-goers had a problem with it. My qualms were with too much Jack Sparrow in the Lone Ranger.Hammer did fairly well. If they were expecting him to be a bumbling buffoon then he nailed it, great acting! Otherwise they just destroyed the courageousness, nobility, and toughness which I think is the essence of the Lone Ranger.The Horse was probably the better actor. My expectations of the horse's acting skill was lower than what I got. And the horse wasn't listed in the credits poor Silver (his real and acting name). Said Bobby Lovgren (Silver's handler), ""...Silver is such a good, quiet horse with such a great attitude. He has real personality."" Maybe the movie should have been called, ""Silver Rides again"". :/",The Lone Ranger

I really enjoyed all 4 Pirates of the Caribbean films and thought that this would basically be a western film that shared many characteristics with the Pirates films. Man was I wrong. The only comparison between the two is that Johnny Depp kills it. This is a long, dull, bland film that has a mediocre story and a very bad twist with plot holes the size o craters on the moon. Unfortunately, many very good performances were thrown away with this film. As previously mentioned, Depp gives a great performance to add to strong performances given by Armie Hammer in the lead, William Fichtner as the villain, and Helena Bonham Carter in her strongest performance since The King's Speech. In contrast to the good performances, there were also bad and disappointing performances. Tom Wilkenson gives a poor performance as well as all the kids in the movie. Also to note, Barry Pepper gives a very disappointing and underwhelming performance. I don't blame the actors as much as I blame the writers, Justin Haythe, Ted Elliot, and Terry Rossio. The tell us a bland story with bad dialogue.

The main cast did their bit with the stunts, and the film was well written. I honestly don't know why it was a ""flop"" but I assure you, a ""flop"" means nothing.While the film was good, it seemed to lack something that Pirates of the Caribbean had.

359,julesrulesny,Excellent Film! (Shame on the Critics who tanked this film - and poorly executed release date),9,15 July 2013,"This movie was actually VERY good.. Good story telling, entertaining, had many great qualities. Good stunt scenes and action sequences were fun to watch.. Even some dark dramatic scenes. But for me, the scenery or cinematography nailed it as you can tell they scouted the film locations rather well in my opinion and tried to stay away from CGI.There were some bad parts of the film, like with any but not warranted to name, nor should it justify a poor performance in the box office.. So, in my opinion this movie tanked because of a poorly timed release. It was up against too many other potential blockbusters. This movie should have been released earlier in the year, perhaps around Memorial Day.. Or later in the year perhaps as a Thanksgiving release!! A movie to succeed like this also takes a nation that must be in the right mood. Making a movie obviously takes skill, but I also believe that in choosing the perfect Release Date can make or break a movie!!Independence Day comes to mind - if that movie were released today, I don't think it would do so well. But being it was released in 96, the time of the Xfiles, the resurgence and discussions of Area 51, all played a big role.. So, I'm just using that as an example, that timing can be everything!So, to me, this was more of a Holiday movie, than a summer Blockbuster.. Either way, poorly executed marketing and release - Combined with Critics destroying a well deserving movie is what did this movie in..I recommend all to see it. Its fun. Entertaining.

360,JRConsidine,Fooled again,5,6 July 2013,"I honestly felt that The Lone Ranger was going to deliver the critical acclaim and awards to that sparse mantle at Johnny Depp's house. I use the word felt because in my ""heart"" I felt it was time. Just because I wanted it to happen obviously did not convince the cosmos that the time had come. Johnny Depp who is beginning to resemble Middle America is not going to win any bling for his work in The Lone Ranger. He's not that good, plain and simple. Armie Hammer had me convinced that he was big enough for this iconic role following his acclaimed ""dual role"" performance in The Social Network. However, the director found it necessary to base this version of the Lone Ranger on the ""cartoon"" version so that the character played by Hammer is neither iconic nor comic. James Badge Dale added another notch in his resume of characters that he played with aplomb. Tom Wilkerson's character is hard to find in the early part of the movie due to the ""uber-beard"" that he sports. Who's to say why you would want to hide Tom Wilkerson. Helena Bonham Carter needs to stop playing prostitutes. Barry Pepper is another big name whose presence cannot stop the bleeding. Gore Verbinski's long-awaited summer blockbuster is a movie where tremendous amount of talent is wasted, along with a bunch of Disney dollars. The film leaves so much to be desired. You might pick at the basic conflict of whether we are watching a satire, a comedy, or a drama. It shifts gears so often that the audience is clutched with confusion. The pinnacle of the movie comes as the ubiquitous Hans Zimmer kicks the orchestra into high gear with the adrenaline producing, ""William Tell Overture"". The Lone Ranger atop Silver (played by a relative of Mister Ed) goes into high gear and then, KABOOM - the movie shift gears and goes off in another direction. The movie concludes with a hint that another chapter may be forthcoming. No one in the audience seemed to give a hoot after 2 hours and 29 minutes of watching a waste of talent and resources.",The Lone Ranger
361,peterdowning17,Critics were Dead Wrong! AND too much Leone!,7,10 January 2014,"Based on the reviews I didn't expect to make it through the first act let alone 149 min. What a pleasant surprise. Depp crushes it with a master class of facial expressions. It's possible that 3/4 of his screen time is spent silently channeling Buster Keaton. So much fun and way better than his Keith Richards Pirate schtick. That, along with the franchise, got old very quickly. Sorry Gore but those movies are nowhere near as good as this one. Armie is fine though I can't help but wonder if there was an actor better suited to the humor of the thing. I was put off by all the lifting from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". It's one of my all time faves and it seemed more like stealing than an homage.

362,thisglimpse-1,A Tale of the Deluded and Delirious,2,11 September 2013,"It seems like all Native America wanted to talk about this summer was ""The Lone Ranger"" and whether it honored or offended Native Americans. I've read articles from Native people on both sides, so I'll let my words be few on this topic. Frankly, I expected it to be worse. It makes some honest, if clumsy and possibly misguided, attempts to honor Native peoples. Its greatest sin is that it relegates Native Americans to the past. Tonto appears to be the last living Indian, and he's hardly more than a peanut-guzzling wax figure in a Wild West museum. The filmmakers might be surprised to find that there are vital and growing Native communities in the 21st century.""The Lone Ranger"" opens in a Wild West museum, where an extremely old Tonto is part of the display. This ancient Indian narrates the entire story to a young boy wearing a toy six-shooter and cowboy hat. About halfway through the film, we learn that Tonto (Johnny Depp), because of childhood trauma, has suffered a break with reality and is completely nuts. When you put these two scenes together - when you recognize that the whole movie is a story told by a man who has completely lost touch with reality - things start to make a little more sense.This is a schizophrenic film. The experience of watching it is similar to what I imagine a visit to a mental hospital would be like. It veers from ridiculous to campy, from fast-paced and breathless to terribly serious to suddenly, perhaps unintentionally, funny again. It's hard to keep up. It might be pointless to try. Like an amusement park ride, the way it moves, jerks, veers and swoops will either make you light-headed and woozy, or it will make you puke.Armie Hammer stars as a self-righteous lawyer who seems to believe that he can singlehandedly bring Justice and Order to the wild, wild West. This is the good guy, and also the film's first big problem: he's completely unlikable. From the beginning of the film to the end, he's stiff, and arrogant, and self-righteous. Even Tonto doesn't like him, but we'll get to that.Hammer quickly gets deputized and rides out into the desert, where the bad guy, who literally eats the heart of his enemy, slaughters everyone around him. Yep, this is a kid's movie. Depp shows up to bury the dead bodies, but discovers that this one's only mostly dead. Mostly dead means slightly alive, so he nurses the stranger with the big white hat back to health, convinced by a bird (or a hallucination of a bird, I'm not sure) that this man can't be killed.Depp and Hammer ride after the bad guys, only to discover that the good guys are actually the bad guys, and the original bad guys don't matter that much, and before long, the Army's involved, and we're all thoroughly confused as far as who's on which side and why.Actually, I'd like to pause and talk about the Army, because it might be the one place where ""The Lone Ranger"" actually has something interesting to say. Barry Pepper plays the Army commander, who is sent in by the government to fight the Comanches, who attacking and killing innocent folks along the frontier. Pepper is presented by the film as a good man sent to do a job, and only concerned with doing it well and completely. It's only after he and his army have slaughtered an entire Comanche war party that he discovers that it wasn't the Comanches killing the ranchers after all, but railroad workers dressed up as Comanches because the evil railroad baron (Tom Wilkinson) wants the Comanches out of the way. Fuller has been tricked and manipulated.Then, so quickly that you might miss it, Pepper comes to a watershed moment in his life -- will he admit that he has unwittingly done a terrible thing, slaughtering innocent people, then repent and try to make amends? Or will he continue down the road he's found himself on, buying the lie he's been told, a lie that justifies his own actions? In this all-too-brief moment, I think the makers of ""The Lone Ranger"" have hit upon the situation of most white Americans, and the tough choice in front of them -- to ignore/justify the past, or to go about the hard, soul-searching work of repentance and reconciliation, and seek a better future. Sadly, I'm afraid most people choose the same path Pepper chose.""The Lone Ranger"" was a big box office disappointment for Disney, and I can't say that you'll miss much if you decide to skip it when it comes out on DVD soon. I didn't find it as terribly offensive as some people did, but frankly, it just wasn't a very good movie. There are certainly better things you could do with your time.",The Lone Ranger

It's a heaving, straining, bursting-at-the-seams, over-plotted, over-special-effected, mediocre film instead.Johnny Depp is enjoyed himself, anyway, and his ratty grumbling ninja version of Tonto approximately works, in an unlikely place somewhere between Hawkeye from Last of the Mohicans and Baldrick; Cactus Jack Sparrow. Armie Hammer is an effective Lone Ranger next to him, straight man but not fool. The relationship just about works, and the ambiguity about who's the lead. And the plot's ok: bit of backstory to hint at depth, bit of bonding, some revenge and some perfidy-thwarting.And if you cut about half an hour, it'll be the right length and a satisfactory film. Lose one of the backstories, distracting and over-burdening. Lose the perfidy-by-committee bit, and stick to the core baddies. Lose the final elaboration of the train stunt, where the incredible becomes pure (and not very good) cartoon.Lose Helena Bonham-Carter. At this point she occupied a bizarre Orson Welles-like place in film, drifting around doing cameos for friends apparently using bits of costume stolen from whatever she'd done the previous week. Her grungy punk fallen woman thing is as enjoyable as ever, but irrelevant here. Sorry.Above all, lose the totally redundant and maddening framing bit in the museum. Because what the heck is it there for? Middle-aged actors in vaguely convincing ancient make-up stopped being a thing in the mid-80s. I was hanging on, teeth gritted, for the end, purely because there had to be some twist coming - some last-minute heart-warming reveal that would explain this otherwise pointless indulgence - obviously the kid's going to turn out to be the young JFK or Bruce Wayne or something... But then - spoiler alert! there's nothing to spoil. It's pointless. Enjoy your cup of tea.(more at thescripthack on wordpress)",The Lone Ranger

365,romrot-mechanikos,So Pirates of the Caribbean 5 was a decent film,7,10 July 2013,"This was not the most original plot I have ever seen in a movie, but the action scenes did mostly make up for it, even though they were super violent. I mean I've seen R rated movies with less violence than this movie. But I am not one to complain about violence in a movie if its warranted and hey this is the wild west, of coarse there will be blood drawn.The acting was quite frankly underwhelming I mean Jonny Depp gave his usual performance, which is good at times and sometimes not. by the way am I the only one who thought they forgot the makeup on Jonny sometimes? speaking of which for a movie titled the lone ranger we sure see a lot more about Tonto.All in all it was a fun flick, with awesome action and great special effects. just don't expect much originality in story.",The Lone Ranger
366,bugus92,It's actually better then you think,8,6 July 2013,"Now if you're reading this, you're probably looking for one good reason to watch this, unremarkable and quite honestly, average movie. Well, that's what I'm here for, and if you're reading this, you've come to the right place.I haven't got one reason why you should watch it. I've got several. I will also quash all the complaints that have been made along the way.Here's the first reason why you should watch this movie, there's Johnny Depp in it. He is without a doubt one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. If you liked him in Pirates of the Caribbean, you're gonna like him here. You'll even see him do the same 'one step' trick that he did at the introduction of the first Pirates movie. Brilliant.Another reason you should watch this is that it's a bloody cowboy movie, through and through. It has plenty of gunfights, Jackie Chan tricks (without Jackie Chan being involved)horses, outlaws, the whole package. Many people then make the mistake of comparing it to movies like ""The good, the bad the ugly"", ""3:10 to Yuma"" or, most importantly the original ""Lone Ranger"" series. You shouldn't compare it. Because Disney made this movie, and therefore, there will be less sense involved and a lot more comical scenes. So don't compare them.Also, if you have seen the movie, and you're wondering how did Tonto carry an unconscious John Reid all the way up that mountain unto that platform?And that stupid horse, how does it appear everywhere?And, why does a vast majority of everything that happens in this movie not make any proper sense?The answer is simple, you must always remind yourself that the entire movie is a story being told by Tonto to a little boy, and as such, anything can happen. People always exaggerate stories, so don't be too surprised.Also, always keep in mind that this is a Disney movie, so a certain level of nonsense is expected. Regardless, I enjoyed this movie. I found it very very entertaining. My only problem with it is that it is unreasonably long. I mean any movie that is more than 2 hours better be outstanding, and this movie was not outstanding. It was nice, but not outstanding. But I would still watch it again. I hope you're convinced now, because this movie is truly worth watching.",The Lone Ranger

This film shows reality as it really was back then and is now.Hollywood likes spewing out propaganda, this film doesn't spew out jingoistic revisionist rhetoric that you see in the films of Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg or George Lucas or the others like to brainwash the stupid masses with.Excellent writing, directing, and storytelling. Only problem that modern MTV generation might have with it, is the slow pace to the storytelling.If you can't stand to watch films, that do not to have an action scene, explosion or sex scene every 5minutes, then you probably won't like this film.

368,gedachtniskirche,The pirates of the Texas prairie,5,4 August 2013,"His incessant costumed screen transfiguration Johnny Depp explains with desire to amuse and interest his own children. But probably Johnny is cunning a little. He didn't play enough himself. This big kid, according as his physical and professional growing, bents for adventures, fairy stories and fantastic plots. As if clings to irrevocably gone childhood, excitedly vesting into an infinite number of variegated magically-fantasy characters. And between these characters, in the «pauses», for the sake of diversity, he embodies into more believable and brutal images of gangsters, writers, investigators, etc. The shy goody Edward «Scissorhands», brave and enterprising Ichabod Crane, controversial and charismatic Captain Jack Sparrow, reckless freethinker John Wilmot, cranky pedant Willy Wonka, vengeful killer Sweeney Todd, charming Mad Hatter, vampire on bonds Barnabas Collins and, finally, the poky Indian Tonto – impressive collection of the most memorable actor's images. Enthusiastic and fruitful cooperation with Tim Burton inexorably led to, that Johnny Depp hopelessly became poppy.But even such a predictable and caricatured image, which we used to watch Johnny Depp in, did not unexpectedly prevent him to oust to the second place the main character of «The Lone Ranger» - actually, the Lone Ranger, John Reid, performed by the young actor Armie Hammer.The tall, textured, fair-haired actor in the traditional Hollywood's view – Armie Hammer played his role inaudibly, mediocre and abstrusely, although he tried very hard. So hard, that I wanted him to leave a shot as soon as possible. Somehow there was a persistent feeling, that actor got to the movie because of someone's casual mistake, which he perfectly recognized, but in order to not to lose his face, tried as hard as he can to please the audience, demonstrating the full maximum of what he is capable of. Just like a girls, coming out, put on the best of their everything at once.The total impression of the film is the same: too much of everything. Very spectacular, very Texas, very stereotyped, very predictably, very stereotypically. If the main character should be a role model of decency and courage by the plot, that then he will be. He responsibly does his duty and reverences the law for the time being. Neither more nor less. And, of course, he is young and good-looking. He certainly has a companion, some extravagant character. The poky Indian - is the very thing. They oppose, of course, to perfidious and cruel villains. One of them most assuredly has a abominable disgusting appearance, another skillfully puts on a mask of a good and tender hearted bureaucrat. What a sad classic of the genre. And, to cap it all, the ladylove of a hero – pretty, desperate widow with bright sonny. That is a typical pattern for a high budget Hollywood adventure western. It is ridiculous for adults, and children don't manage to keep up with rapidity of a plot at all, stuffed with impressive and lightning tricks. Nothing new and unexpected, but it isn't boring and dreary at least.",The Lone Ranger
369,Mohamad_Asmar,10 Stars for the 60's of 2013.,10,7 December 2013,"Incredible, I have no words to say, just amazing, and a must see movie.I like Johnny Depp, one of my favorite actors, and Tonto here was a great character, plus he was so funny and given the film more comedy. Really, it's not what I was expected when I saw the film released, it was a great movie for me, and a 10 Star of the 60's in the developed world.Armie Hammer was good, having a big role. I would say that I prefer Antonio Banderas to be ""The Lone Ranger"" but I know that we can't see him here because of his ""Legend of Zoro"".

370,jaythejza,"Better than I expected, quite long, but very tongue in cheek.",6,29 August 2013,"I was quite surprised by this movie, as I was not expecting a lot from it, as it had received a few average reviews & lots of people saying it was a box office flop. While some of that may be true, this was still a movie I enjoyed for what it was.I'm pretty sure everyone will have an idea what this movie is about, being a movie based around the TV series. But for those who don't, Native American Tonto (Johnny Depp) retells the story of John Reid (Armie Hammer) and his journey to becoming the Lone Ranger. As a man of the law, his morals and judgement are tested as he continues on his journey to becoming a legend, along with the man who rescued him from near death, the erratic Tonto. The story follows their adventure to find outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and bring him to justice, which is an ideal that both have a very different outlook of and tests their relationship throughout the movie.It's difficult to escape comparisons to the likes of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" when you have Gore Verbinski directing a movie starring Johnny Depp, in a similar costume to Jack Sparrow. The movie does follow a similar adventure theme, with plenty of action & tongue in cheek humour & the relationship between the duo was entertaining, as they are both very different. I did enjoy Depp's Tonto, although when you stand that up against other characters he has played throughout his career, he may be glossed over. I thought Armie Hammer did well with the lead character, the chemistry between him & Depp was good, if a little basic & slow to start off, with Hammer setting up the pitch for Depp to knock them out of the ball park. I still can't help that some of the laughs didn't really make me change a smile into a laugh. I did find that a lot of the early action didn't grip me like it should of, I just felt like I didn't care for what was happening, like the excitement and suspense had passed me by, but this changed in the latter part of the movie, partly helped by the Lone Ranger theme being played though it! The latter part of the movie had a good build up to it & did feel like it paid off, but overall, as much as I can understand it was needed to fill out the back story, the movie did feel a little long.Overall, it was an enjoyable movie. It did feel like a family adventure movie, but compared to other offerings out there, it didn't quite grab me as much as I think was originally intended. Maybe it's the overuse of a tried & tested formula, but I can understand why people weren't raving about it, it just kinda felt... OK I guess. I'm not disappointed I saw it, far from it, but It's not the sort of movie I would watch over again & again. I wasn't the target audience, but I'm sure there are many kids & families out there that really enjoyed this movie.",The Lone Ranger
371,davidjemitus,Good but not that good,7,18 July 2017,"An interesting take on the Lone Ranger story with the lead character being Tonto played by Johnny Depp.Some of it has great humour and is fun to watch and some of it has great special effects and is stunning to watch.But much of it is just nasty - the film doesn't seem sure where to tread the line between being likable and just being horrible. Many films manage to make the bad guys bad but the film still fun but this one misses that target by a mile for a lot of scenes.The entire end section is fabulous - dramatic, special effects and stunts and a lot of fun. Wish the rest of the film had been as well made.A big let down on what it could have been",The Lone Ranger

Yes, it is a bit too long and yes, it deserves the PG-13 rating and I would not take little kids to see it, but it was much better than I expected. I don't know why the critics are being so hard on it. It's an entertaining summer movie and should be viewed as such. I know a lot of fans of the Moore/Silverheels version are bad mouthing it, but honestly, they weren't given a lock on the roles for eternity and people forget it was a radio show before they even started filming their version. Go see this version with an open mind, enjoy it for what it is, and enjoy yourself.

373,tsh85,Terrible Drivel,1,7 July 2013,"The Bruckheimer/Verbinski team is at it once again, and once again they have completely failed. This is so typical of the Disney Franchise....to take a legendary show, write a mediocre script (that has nothing to do with the actual Lone Ranger), and get a big name like Johnny Depp to star in it. Let's face it, with Johnny Depp starring, people are going to see the movie no matter how terrible it is, simply because he is in it. This is something that Disney does very well. They take a show that's more than 30 years old (1957 in this case) and they remake it into a movie because the majority of their fan base is under 30 years old, so they have no idea how accurate the movie actually is.First of all, the real Lone Ranger was one of the bravest men alive, not a sniveling little wimp (as depicted in this movie). The characters (including Tonto) looked nothing like the actual characters in the original Lone Ranger. What's up with the thick crumbling face paint, and the dead bird on his head? He looks more like a pygmy that just got off the first plane from the Congo in Africa. This movie is nothing but another 2 1/2 hour 'Pirates of the Caribbean' with characters dressed as cowboys and Indians. This is because Bruckheimer and Verbinski have one style and one style only. They are not talented enough to expand, so all of their movies have the exact same recipe (good guys, fighting the bad guys, for a damsel in distress). Let's face it, we all know that Disney has completely lowered the criteria for talent in this country with all of these ""so-called"" new Disney stars such as: Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Ashley Tisdale, Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, and Vanessa Hudgens. They can't sing, act, or dance their way out of a box if they wanted to.This movie is such a flop in the hugest way, it saddens me that they spent 250 million dollars to make it. I'm guessing most of this money went to pay the salaries of the actors. This is definitely one of those movies that you will spend the last hour looking at your watch every five minutes waiting for it to end. Don't get me wrong, I think Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor, but the fact that he keeps accepting roles in these mediocre Disney films simply says that he is a complete sell out. It's hard for me to discern exactly what stereotype he's tackling with this oddball incarnation of Tonto, which has all the eccentricity of Captain Jack Sparrow, but only half of the wit. Depp has become another sellout who will take any movie role for X amount of money; there is no artistic integrity involved. Armie Hammer, who I also enjoy, does not have the acting ability to pull off a lead role such as this. He is much better used in co-starring roles such as his role in J Edgar.The most important aspect of the original Lone Ranger was that it always had a lesson that each episode taught us, something of ethics and morality. This movie does nothing of the kind, it is simply a western with people blowing stuff up. If you're a typical Disney sheep, who will pay good money to see any movie that Disney throws at you, you will probably love this movie. This is what they count on, and is the reason they keep making these awful films. If you are a preteen, you will probably love this movie. If you're one of those people who worship Johnny Depp and will pay to see anything that he is in, you will probably love this movie. If you want to see a movie that has any artistic integrity, or a movie that has a great story and plot, you will hate this movie. If you grew up watching the original Lone Ranger, you will be sadly disappointed (once again) at the mockery that Disney has made of a pure classic. I can understand why Depp is in disguise and Hammer wears a mask...I would be embarrassed to be in this film as well. Hi Ho Silver Away!",The Lone Ranger

It's a great mix of spaghetti and classic western influences (see if you can spot For a Few Dollars More, Once Upon A Time in the West and Little Big Man references, not to mention True Grit, to name a few), Indiana Jones and, oh yes, the Lone Ranger! My one criticism is it's too long, but a rip roaring finale and the William Tell Overture more than make up for it! I hope Disney is not put off from doing a sequel, as the studio was with last year's equally under-rated John Carter of Mars effort. I say hi-ho, Silver, as far as a follow-up is concerned!

It haves it all, a not forced and very fun comedy (most of all coming from Johnny Depp & ""Spirit Horse""), a great action sequences that develops in a very unexpected and comic way, suspense, and a big background of drama as accurate, that almost its a ""based on real events"" story., great script, plot, direction, and actings. Also it's good to see that chemistry that Gore Verbinski & Mr. Depp brigs to the screen, plus the secondary but charismatic part of Helena Bonham Carter.And, if you see a review with a rate of 7 or less, it has to be a wrong review and you should skip it, 'cause this is a 8 or 9 over 10 movie.",The Lone Ranger
376,giorgiothesmurf,The Lone Ranger is TOTALLY AWESOME,8,3 July 2013,"THE GOOD: The Horses, it is always exciting watching John Reid ride a horse with high speed. Butch Cavendish was the villain to desire, he was epic. The trains, the train fights with horses and guns were eye popping. To the end, there was an epic train battle with the classical The Lone Ranger music we all love. The storyline of the movie was similar to the 1949 The Lone Ranger show. The special effects were very amusing in some scenes. The acting from Armie Hammer, Johnny Depp and William Fichtner was really good. The action was exciting and fun to watch. The silver bullet. The ''Hi Yo Silver'' at the end was good to see. Go watch this movie, you will love it!THE BAD: They made Tonto too serious, they should have just stayed to the normal 1949 version. The story was quite different to the 1949 version, but I do understand it's a new take on the iconic character. I hated the storytelling from Tonto to the little kid. I thought Red was useless, her wooden leg and gun coming from her boot was crap and cheesy. This movie was way to comedic. Tonto's look was horrifying and not original. Spirit walker and all that mystic stuff.OVERALL: I know this movie is a new take to The Lone Ranger, I like it for what it is.

After I watched this movie, I watched the original first episode. Clearly, the term ""legendary"" belongs only to the mind of a 7- 10 year old from the 50s. The original show was screened from 1949 to 1957. I grew up with it in the 60s, well after it's use-by date and I loved it. I hadn't rushed to see the movie because of the reviews. NO child would be satisfied the original show today - the acting and writing from the original (ACTUAL Lone Ranger) was atrocious. Best you negatives revisit the original series and your rose coloured glasses will be torn from your faces!I was delighted that the movie stuck loosely to the original story line. Same names, same concept but with modern and very entertaining twists. I truly felt like someone who loved the Lone Ranger had remade it with that integrity intact, improving on and surpassing anything I could have imagined possible. I'm with Quentin Tarantino on this one ... the movie started great, was a bit slow in the middle (what isn't?) and finished with a bang. I don't know what movie people are bagging out here with all these negative reviews. The Lone Ranger was always a kid's story. A simplistic kid's western.

That's the only reason I rated it a 9 instead of a 10.All the acting was top notch, great bad guys, wonderful hero, but I especially loved the character of Tonto as portrayed by Johnny Depp. Mystical, intelligent, a little crazy, and altogether wonderful.

Johnny Depp plays, as he has in most of his movies, Johnny Depp, and the more bizarre the better. A dead crow has more to say than he does, and the ""feeding"" of this bird on his head is such a silly affectation as to be an immediate turnoff. There actually could be a viable story, the elements are there; among these elements are corporate greed (certainly a timeless theme), maltreatment of a native population, misuse of our military, and so forth. Add in misogyny, bigotry, cruelty, insanity, murder, etc, and there's everything there to furnish the building blocks for a good movie. Too bad it was so stupid....literally. You know a movie is bad when you find yourself looking at your watch and wondering how much more you can take without walking out.Arnie Hammer is probably a good actor, but you wouldn't know that here. I hope he hasn't built any expectations of a series based on this experience. Helen Bonham Carter is in this too, not sure why except to show off an artificial limb, as her role is totally unnecessary. The villains actually have the best parts.

382,alanclarke714,A Fun Adventure,8,17 July 2013,"I can understand critics when it comes to certain movies (especially ones I love that get mixed responses), but this year, there have been two big blockbusters that have gotten some of the worst responses ever, and ones that are complete bull, one of them being the Lone Ranger.From director Gore Verbinski and the writers of the Pirates saga, The Lone Ranger is a retelling of the character from the early 30s. Told from the narration of an elderly Tonto at a San Francisco fair in 1933, the story revolves around John Reid, a lawyer who was raised with his brother on the frontier and is now returning. When he, his brother Dan, and five other US Rangers are killed by outlaw Butch Cavendish, Tonto recovers John. When he comes back to life, Tonto sees that he is a ""spirit walker"" or one who has been to the other side and returned. Now, John cannot die in battle, & teams with onto to save Dan's family and stop Cavendish from ruining life in the West.This movie is far from perfect, but it sure as hell is better than the latest Pirates film. The directing here is good, with some truly remarkable cinematography and great action sequences. The acting is good, with a lot of goofiness from John's character and Tonto, respectively. But Tonto is much different from Depp's Jack Sparrow, going from weird to very serious in a split-second. William Fichtner's Cavendish was just disturbing, being very violent and brutal for a PG-13 film, but adds to the atmosphere and danger greatly. The visuals were fantastic, but not the best of the year. The music was superb, with this being Hans Zimmer's fourth commitment to one of Gore's films, and the use of William Tell's Overture was just amazing.Overall, The Lone Ranger was not an award-winning picture or great, but it was good, ridiculous fun that the fourth Pirates film should have been.

However these good points could not prop up the ridiculous dialog of Tonto and the overall degradation of Striker's original story.

My entertainment dollars were well spent on this one.It does help to know something about the comic book genre or having seen some of the Lone Ranger TV shows; it helps you enjoy the inside jokes.",The Lone Ranger
387,valgreet,Very entertaining,8,21 July 2013,"I saw this last night, and I found it very entertaining. It was like an amusement park ride, with plenty of humor, and some truly spectacular action scenes that can't possibly be computer generated. Johnny Depp's Tonto is wonderful - he is a treasure. Armie Hammer does a great job as the masked man. I know that The Lone Ranger has received a great deal of negative critical attention, so I was surprised that when I entered the theater as the previews started, it was so crowded that there were few seats left. The rest of the audience enjoyed it as well - the two women sitting next to me laughed throughout the movie and there was applause when the film ended, something that I have not encountered for a long time. I would highly recommend it as a great film for families, but not small children as there are some intense scenes.",The Lone Ranger
388,MikaOznam,Better than you heard,7,13 February 2015,"the critics bashed this movie but to my surprise, this is one of the better movies I've seen Depp in quite sometime. I luv Depp but much of the output lately leaves me somewhat unfulfilled.In fact, it's Ruth Wilson that somewhat drew me in to watching this western otherwise i would have passed on it I was expecting a redux of Jack Sparrow character but far from that.Decent story line, characters are somewhat walking caricatures but still worth a few cups of popcorn. Much stereotyping but nothing with bad intentNot high art but a fun western with some well timed good chuckles.Good movie for a lazy Sunday or rainy day since it's a tad long at close to 3 hours.",The Lone Ranger
389,britto-charles,The Lone Ranger - Resurrection Of The Radio Hero,7,12 October 2013,"Director Gore Verbinski who's known for his ""Pirates of the Caribbean(POC)"" franchise has collaborated with most of his team from POC for The Lone Ranger. Initially conceived for a radio show The Lone Ranger made it to TV series and then into film starring Clayton Moore(Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels(Tonto), the 2013 reboot of the film has Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp reprising the characters respectively.The movie begins as a frame narrative, narrated by Tonto(Johnny Depp) to Will who visits a Wild West fair where Tonto is a live mannequin.As a non linear screenplay the story shifts between scenes filled with everything you'd see in a 'Western Movie'. Armie Hammer as in the titular role makes you realize why Clayton Moore is irreplaceable, instead of fighting for justice he could have done justice to his role. Being his first major role Armie seems to be out shadowed by the presence of Depp. Can you imagine Robin outperforming Batman(Already getting images of B slapping R), yes that's what lacks in The Lone Ranger. Tonto(Depp) is the USP for this movie, is it me who thinks that Tonto is just another variant of Captain Jack Sparrow? His voice vaguely reminds me of the English speaking Irrfan Khan in Hollywood movies. Where there's a Depp there's an Helena Bonham Carter(Red Harrington) who does a supporting role. William Fichtner as Bush Cavendish and Tom Wilkinson as Latham Cole are the other few notable characters.A major part of the technicians from POC have been used for The Lone Ranger, beginning from the Director we have the story writing duo of Terry Rossio and Tedd Elliott, Hans Zimmer has scored for this film. Just like the theme song for POC we have The Lone Ranger theme song which is from the finale of Willam Tells overture. listening to the finale orchestrated by Zimmer is literally music to the ears. Disney is another close associate of this team, they're known for their family audience will loose that status because of a considerable amount of gore(no 'm not mentioning the director) and violence in this movie.All is well that ends well, it fits right for ""The Lone Ranger"" , however long the movie maybe the final 20 minutes will make you forget everything. One of the best action sequences of this year otherwise its yet another Disney film. If you've decided to watch this movie watch it for Depp and the action sequence.",The Lone Ranger
390,sherilcox,"I'm a Chump, I Admit It.",4,8 July 2013,"For those people who like to mix contemporary vernacular with late 19th Century legends, Disney's Lone Ranger will be an epic entertainment. If you like gruesome images, unimaginative characters, grotesque massacres, and runaway trains, then this is the film for you. Hammer's lackluster Ranger, and Depp's unconvincing Tonto will amuse those people who don't know any better than the mostly adolescent male audience with whom I shared the viewing. They loved it, there is no mistaking that. Even my date, a respectable middle aged man who appreciates Disney and admires Depp, seemed mesmerized by the mayhem. (He owes me a good movie!) I used to believe I liked Depp, too. But frankly, after reviewing his last ten years of work, I only like the idea of Depp. I shouldn't have expected anything more from the Verbinski/Disney/Bruckheimer triumvirate. Blockbusters, franchises, and product tie-ins will make this a reliable profit recipe for the next ten years after ""Lone Ranger"" is followed-up with three or four obscene sequels. I'm the chump, though, because I knew better and went anyway.",The Lone Ranger
391,HarveyA2010,Good to look at!,7,15 August 2013,"The Lone Ranger is an enjoyable film but is also very tedious, The film is visually amazing to watch with its scenery, set pieces (the Bridge and the Comanche camps stick out to me) and action, but I felt there wasn't enough full on fighting or there was no big ass shoot out.I was expecting this film to be really funny as its from the team of Pirates of the Caribbean... but its not, there were a couple of little laughs but they weren't big or hilarious, and I felt a lot of the humour was heavily forced.Tonto (Johnny Depp) was another positive about this film I felt this was some of his best acting (that I have seen) and yes it has elements of Captain Jack Sparrow among others but its different and I liked it.But on the other hand I found The Lone Ranger Himself (Armie Hammer) quite dull and boring and I felt this just devalued the film a lot of the time it was Armie bringing the forced laughs (I know that Isn't his fault)The thing that annoyed most of all about this film for me was all the scenes and the whole concept of the little kid at a fair talking to a wax model of Tonto which is walking around, this annoyed me because it ruined the adventure of which Tonto and The Lone Ranger were going on and it kept cutting in and out of it.",The Lone Ranger
392,SergeMiles,Absolute garbage no matter how you spin it,2,4 July 2013,"With a massive budget, top class actors and a rock solid director, you'd think that would equal something remotely resembling a quality film. You'd be mistaken.From the get go Johnny Depp dissolves into a goofy take on the Indian Tonto. For starters I think JD is one of the great actors of our time and an exceptionally cool dude. However I wish he could take on some more serious roles and get out of this half wit phase of idiotic characters.Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger does a solid job with what he was given. Basically he gives a lack luster performance with no real edge. The Lone Ranger is a painful mess which is entirely to long. Sure there's an underlying meaning to the story but who cares if it is delivered in this pointless way. For an estimated $250,000,000 surely they could have sharpened up the production a bit and given it more depth.If the story fails then I often don't care if the action and visuals are good. Again this is not the case. We're put through literally a prolonged train wreck which will entertain simpletons. What a waste of talent and money.",The Lone Ranger
393,deanrowan585,The Lone Ranger.. What a bore-fest.,3,14 August 2014,"What an over-rated hype this film is. It's boring, repetitive and tedious. First of all the film is too long. The film runs for over two hours. Yes, two hours of boring Disney live action. Now to be fair, the film had some positive elements like the cinematography and the historical aspect of the film seems to be accurate. However, that doesn't make up for all of the horrible writing and premise of this horrible adaptation of the original Lone Ranger films. The acting in this film was god awful. Johnny Depp.. I have no idea what he was thinking when he agreed to take on the role of Tonto. This is also the first film I have seen with Armie Hammer. He also, is awful. Helena Bonham Carter plays somewhat of a sexy role in this film. However, little did I know.. she is in the film for like 15 minutes altogether. Then it cuts back to the same old tripe. I had no idea it was William Fichtner playing the outlaw of this film. That character also had 0% charisma. The music of this film is so repetitive. Didn't the film makers realise that they were just looping the same music for the final train scene. What a joke. It was just horrible. The music, the acting, the premise, the film! It's just the same old wasted material. I got bored of all of this 'live action' tripe since POTC 'On stranger Tides' Possibly even before that. Overall rating - 3/10",The Lone Ranger

I delayed watching it until this week and must say, what's with all the negativity? This was a great film. It's a whimsical, almost satirical look at the genre and the legend that is The Lone Ranger. It was true to the origin, well filmed by the way, and Tonto was a scene stealer. The film remained true to tales of the west with villains, saloons, brawls, treachery, heroes, and just a lot of fun. Who are these critics and what do they know? We, the fans, are the real critics anyway! Film kept my interest and had me squirming in my seat, laughing almost out loud, tension filled, inspiring, especially to the William Tell Overture towards the end. I wish there would be a sequel.

Tonto. That is ALL I can say. Tonto. I 100% believe that Johnny Depp is to credit for bringing Tonto to life and, as always, breathing life into the character. The story of Tonto is relatable and reflects a lot of us and our guilt as adult for things that happened in our childhood. Armie Hammer is great as well; him and Depp have a chemistry that is a match made in costar heaven. I'd love to see a sequel. 10/10",The Lone Ranger

A would be western made by someone who saw too many Italian spaghetti westerns and would have been better inspired watching John Ford, Delmer Daves, Howard Hawks, Robert Aldrich and so many others. These directors knew what action was all about and how to show it on screen. Mixing action and humor requires a kind of talent that is definitely lacking here and which is replaced by hysterical editing and cutting. A sure sign of poor directing. Whoever got the idea of turning The Lone Ranger character into a stupid mindless moron should be sentenced to watch this film over again. What can anyone say about Johnny Depp ?

The script is written by someone who does not know which target audience to reach (children? nostalgic mid lifers? tweens?) or what genre to be (western? super hero movie? comedy? action?). Basically it is bad on an epic level.And that's just the script. Let's not mention the ""acting"" of both leads. Armie Hammer has never been God's gift to acting but Depp also disappoints. It is simply not funny - it is simply not exciting - it is simply extremely boring and very loooooooooooooooooong.If we could filter IMDb on ""real"" reviews versus ""fake - aka sponsored by the producers"" there would be a more balanced review: 90% of the people who saw this movie (including the critics) think it is bad. 10% did enjoy it, and I am very happy for them.When you read the ""positive"" reviews it is so painstakingly easy to separate the genuine user reviews from the paid for reviews (i.e. the complete absence of spelling mistakes, the lack of use of slang or any emotive language, the continuous urging and pushing to go and see it, to 'check it out for yourself' ...) If this trend continues and IMDb does not filter these out (look at torrent sites, they are very good at distinguishing fake from real) I am afraid movie buffs will turn to a new provider shortly.For all the people out there who want a real review: it stinks.

Each of the characters is unique unto him/herself, the setting makes you feel as if you are there, feeling the heat of the desert, the cool of the shade, and the wind as the train careens out of control.The historical significance, I fear, may be what caused these 'intellectual' men to dislike the film.

403,wmcg001,One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen,10,29 October 2014,"This movie blew me away. Ironically I wasn't going to watch it. As a kid I wasn't a fan of the TV series, sometimes watching it because nothing else was on. I luckily fell into watching the cable movie for the same reason. During the political season I limit my favorite network & local news shows until after Tivo records them. The political commercials are disgusting. So misleading. They lack substance about what matters if you care about the human race. For example they often mention ""for stricter gun laws"" It's dumbfounding. I've been hearing that for over 20 years! I realize change takes time, but come on...The movie LONE RANGER was so well crafted. It's an entertaining work of art. The actors were right on. Tonto should of won an academy award. The movie ends up to be an exciting thrill ride and an emotional roller coaster with an extremely satisfying big finish. Visually it's breathtaking. Filmed in Utah with scenery that made me happy to be alive and see. This movie never disappoints.",The Lone Ranger
404,TheColonel1947,Depp misses by a mile,1,24 July 2013,"The movie is a mess. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Some scenes are extremely violent and then others have over-the-top comedy. There's no cohesion and a storyline that goes off piste way too often. Depp trivialises the Native American (God knows what their take is on this) whereas Jay Silverheels (the TV Tonto) was a campaigner for the rights of Native Americans in Hollywood. Some legacy. Armie Hammer could have been good but was directed to play the part as an incompetent fool, the opposite of Fran Striker's original. Incidentally, Striker - who created The Lone Ranger, doesn't even get a credit. It is sad when iconic heroes are trivialised. I'm amazed more Americans aren't up-in-arms. Anyway, it's no more than you should expect from the Disney Corporation, they sold their souls a long time ago.",The Lone Ranger
405,farmersrachel,Watch out for the violence if you have small children,3,4 July 2013,"I rarely write a review but I want to warn people about this movie. First off I am shocked at the amount of graphic violence in this movie. I went with my son, daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren between the ages of 5 and 11. These kids are familiar with PG13 and have watch movies with violence in them but this was way too much! Large numbers of Indians and settlers are ripped apart by Gatling guns, people are crushed, stabbed, even a graphic scene where a heart is cut out of a still living man. I was appalled that Disney would allow this kind of violence in a movie that I thought was aimed toward a family audience with children. I was disgusted and I watch some pretty violent movies, I am not a shrinking violet grandma. It was unnecessary to the plot which by the way was wandering and boring. The scenery was the only standout in the movie. Also, what is up with the upper lip on the lead actress? If that is botox she should stop now and get her lip reduced. Every time I looked at her I just thought of a duck! The movie was poorly edited, about 30 minutes could have been left on the floor. Johnny Depp just looked like Jack Sparrow had moved to the southwest, and Armie Hammer is just flat. The only interesting part of the movie is near the very end when they finally unleash the Lone Ranger music and pair it with a great action sequence. By then it was too late. There are many better movies to spend your money on this summer. Go see Fast & Furious, Star Trek, Ironman 3, and especially Despicable Me.",The Lone Ranger

407,admiraljoshhar,"I'm disappointed, but you may not be",4,15 July 2013,"I really wanted to like this movie. I grew up watching reruns of Lone Ranger with my parents, and I used to pretend I was the Ranger all the time, so I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the big-screen. I'd heard ahead of time that the William Tell Overture was well used (it was!) and that he does say ""Hi-Yo Silver, Away!"" So I was hopeful.Sadly, I was disappointed. In my opinion, this movie raped the character of the Lone Ranger, turning him into a wimpy lawyer with a mask (that he doesn't even put on until halfway through the movie, not counting the brief intro during Tonto's first flashback that had me saying ""The Lone Ranger doesn't rob banks!"" before the kid does, though to be fair there was a good reason for it as shown later on).I'll start off with my grievances with the movie, so I can end this review on a positive note.My biggest issue with this movie that had me practically frothing at the mouth in outrage was the change in what ""Kemosabe"" means. Now, from what I understand, ""Kemosabe"" is not a real Indian word, but that it actually translates to ""he-who-does-not-know."" So I suppose the writer's felt justified in changing the meaning for this reboot. BIG MISTAKE. ""Kemosabe"" does NOT mean ""Wrong Brother,"" it means ""Trusted Friend!""Another similar issue was near the end, when the Lone Ranger finally used his catchphrase...which was, to my disappointment and admittedly fan boy rage, immediately followed by Tonto saying ""Never do that again."" Most of the people at the Drive-in I was at laughed, and I must admit, without my personal bias, I might have also found it amusing. You see, I completely understand where they were coming from- ""Hi-Yo Silver,away!"" is an outdated catchphrase, a relic of the radio show. So my question is this: why include it at all? All it's presence did was bring a cheap laugh from the common movie goer and anger from fans like me who actually remember the original iconic feel of the Lone Ranger's battle cry! That would be like (if you'll excuse my genre slipping) Matt Smith's 11th Doctor saying that the Fourth Doctor's frequent and iconic ""Would you like a jelly baby?"" catchphrase was stupid!A few other problems I had with the movie was in the overly excessive use of CGI. This is especially evident in the admittedly amusing scene where Silver licks scorpions off of the Ranger's face (it makes sense in context). You go from an obviously real horse to an almost cartoonish tongue and snout! On a related note, what was with the carnivorous CGI rabbits? I know ""nature is out of balance!"" was Tonto's explanation, but couldn't there have been a better way of showing it than cartoon vampire rabbits fighting over a morsel of meat?Okay, I've covered MOST of the negative points (there's more, but it would take forever to list), but what worked in the movie? What brought it up from 1 star out of 10 to 4 stars out of 10?THE WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE, THAT'S WHAT!!!!!!!I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed Hans Zimmer's finale sequence, which added a bit of modern flare to the classic overture, and almost had me cheering for a character I had come to hate through the movie!But besides the soundtrack, there were other things that worked as well.The actors of the movie performed well, and their characters benefited from it. They (and, more specifically, the Ranger himself) only suffered from bland writing that turned an action hero into a wimpy lawyer with a mask and a gun he rarely uses.Tonto (as portrayed by Johnny Depp) especially worked in this movie. The backstory they gave the supposed sidekick would not have worked for Jay Silverheels' Tonto, but for Johnny Depp's it explains why he is the way he is better than Pirates of the Caribean explained Captain Jack Sparrow's quirkiness. Quite simply, he acts crazy because he IS crazy- his mind snaps when he realizes that he inadvertently betrayed his village, resulting in the deaths of his entire family. The frequent shots of the dead bird in the river accentuate his denial and mental escape from reality, and explains why he wears the bird (which in his mentally broken state still sees as real) and feeds it.Finally, the climactic finale. After the train sequence near the beginning of the movie, I thought they played their cards too early. Fortunately, I was wrong in this instance. The climactic battle on the trains was actually pretty good (especially accompanied by Zimmer's new interpretation of the William Tell Overture!). They did take quite a few noticeable liberties with the laws of physics (I'm pretty sure you can't throw something from one fast moving train to another which is going at a different speed and have it fly straight over) but I'll excuse it on the grounds that it was a decent sequence, and Tonto's final line to the movie's villain when he finally get's revenge on the men who tricked him into betraying their village was worth it, as was the William Tell Overture (yes, I know, I'm repeating myself, but it was just so GOOD, in a movie filled with such drivel).Basically, if you aren't a fan of the show or have never seen it, you might enjoy this new movie. My 10 year old cousin was certain he wouldn't like it (he has no interest in Westerns) but I dragged him along. Ironically, I didn't like the movie, he did! So if you have never seen The Lone Ranger, give it a watch. But if you have and you don't want to see your childhood memories defiled, don't bother with it- just buy the soundtrack and leave it at that!",The Lone Ranger

Gore Verbinski has delivered a film that moves leisurely along peppered with rousing action sequences, comedy, villainy and pathos. It is solid entertainment. I would place this movie alongside Waterworld, The Last Action Hero, and John Carter as unfairly panned films which deserves to succeed in the cinema halls.It is too bad that there appears to be a hate on for this movie simply because it seems that a lot of money was spent in its making. But look at it this way, when you hire real stunt persons, construct and destroy real trains and stage many stunts for real, it is not going to be cheap.

409,h-english-329-216405,The Lone Ranger - Review,6,19 August 2013,"The Lone Ranger is by no means as impressive as the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. However it's certainly better than many critics have suggested. The Disney production is simply a cinematic escape from your day. I'm sure if you devote your time to pointing out the historical inaccuracies that occur in the film you could more than destroy your experience watching. But if you can manage to suspend disbelief for the two an a half hour running time and instead indulge in the outrageous action sequences then you may find you'll leave the theater with a greater satisfaction from your investment. There's no doubt that The Lone Ranger succeeds most through it's wacky action sequences. Gore Vebrinkski orchestrates erratic stunts that are both humorous and fantastical, which help draw out the best from Armie Hammer as the lead. His more seasoned counterpart, Johhny Depp, amuses with his facial expressions and perfect timing as always. The real shame however is that despite the lengthy running time, scenes of this kind are few and far between.The problem with the Lone Ranger is that, action sequences apart, we're left with a poor script and a lot of flat characters, for a whopping two an a half hours. Firstly there's a bad-guy overload issue that needs to be addressed. Butch Cavendish (William Fintcher) gets a woefully low showing as the main antagonist in the plot. Instead we see more of his screwball henchmen who essentially just show up to be knocked down. A top the lack of depth in the baddies ranks, The Lone Ranger also suffers from it's unflattering heroes. The Lone Ranger himself, is a rather dull and forgettable guy. Even though he's overshadowed by his brother and suffers a grueling challenge of revenge when tragedy strikes, he still fails to grab much sympathy at all.It's ultimately left to Johnny Depp to carry the film in between the action sequences. Although he does a good job, the flatness of the script and character make this a difficult task. There's a good possibility that the most amusing character could have been their trusty spirit horse, who doesn't put a foot wrong!When action strikes, the Lone Ranger is at it's best. But it lacks the likability of a Jack Sparrow quality character to take us through the long run time. The film even contains a surprising amount of violence for a Disney production which was interesting. It's debatable to say if The Lone Ranger has a successful franchise on it's hands. If a second outing is to happen there would be a need for some serious revisions. A better script, shorter running time and an increase in action seem like logical places to start.",The Lone Ranger
410,sooprcool,Loved this Movie but hated John Carter,9,5 July 2013,"I find it bothersome that people are comparing this movie to John Carter. John Carter was a disaster, I found no redeeming qualities in it. This movie however is a masterpiece. Johnny Depp is at his absolute best and easily carries this movie into the realm of greatness. It's a very modern looking film based in a time period from long ago. Makes for a wonderful re-boot of the Lone Ranger as a spirit walker, who fights for justice and cannot be killed. I think some folks will not like the way the Lone Ranger doesn't come into his own until the end, having to be looked after by Tonto. But I think that is all part of the re-boot. You have to understand that the Lone Ranger became great, he didn't start out that way. Thanks Disney for giving us back our superhero.",The Lone Ranger
411,hhhpccc,"Not that good, But not that bad. Meh.",6,24 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger isn't especially a good film- though, its not that bad either. I was rather reluctant to see it, as I'm not a person who really enjoys western films, for whatever reason. I never really was interested in ""Cowboys and Indians"" as most children are at a certain part of their childhood, which may just be the reason why movies based around such premises have never interested me. Anyhow, when my family brought me to see this film, I tried to be as non-biased as possible in watching it, and even still, it wasn't really enjoyable- for a few reasons.Firstly, the story isn't anything really special. Its what one would typically expect from a Disney film; lots of action to the point of it just being filler, and not much story aside from that other than just enough to give all reason to all of the action/mild violence that is in the film. The acting wasn't anything bad either- just the same as anyone would expect from Johnny Depp. As I have not seen many (if any, i cannot recall) films from Armie Hammer, I cannot judge his performance, but if there's anything to be said on the matter, it was a good act. In my honest opinion, though, the whole addition of the child (Will) talking to Tonto in the museum exhibit is absolutely unnecessary- the writers could have (and should have) simply cut the crap and skipped right into the story of Tonto remembering his time with the Lone Ranger. Again, There wasn't anything remarkable in terms of Technical elements; The camera work was somewhat regular compared to most other films of today, though I must give them credit for using actual Reel Film for the capture of this movie. This could have something to do with the technical beef I do have with this movie; the color is overly inconsistent. One shot, and everything is a certain hue, exposure, saturation, etc. and then the next shot right after all of the previous hues, exposures, and saturation are DIFFERENT. Being someone who edits color in videos with software such as BlackMagic DaVinci Resolve and Adobe SpeedGrade, I know how easy it can be to screw up on color grading and correction, but at the same time, how easy it is to fix these screw-ups, and Disney should know this, and also fix it. Oh well.So, Even though almost all of the other reviewers for this movie on this website are saying ""don't trust the critics"" and all of that, I must say that some of the critics are right; this movie isn't all that its cracked up to be, and definitely not something I'll be watching again anytime soon.",The Lone Ranger
412,xuelingyunguaiguai,"successful entertainment, definitely worth watching",7,17 October 2013,"As a foreigner I obviously don't know the background of Lone Ranger, before watching this 2013 version I know nothing about Tonto or John Reid. However, I personally think this movie isn't as bad as critics said at all, on the contrary, I consider it a fairly successful one. It contains the Hollywood celebrities Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and William Fichtner etc. it contains entertainment elements, I actually laughed now and then at scenes like Tonto's deadpan humor. It contains the action and adventure part, the beginning bits and the last 20 min plots are both exciting and you'll never want to have a pee time. It also contains myth and unnatural staff, such as the native Indians and the white spiritual horse. All of these factors are on the right track of making a good movie. However, there did exist some under the average level plots and odd lines for the characters. As to one of the most mysterious and Gothic woman in the world- Helena Bonham Carter, I think her part is not that brilliant as Tonto or John Reid, there should be some deep buried secrets for this red hair madam but it didn't show up throughout the movie. Another weak link in my perspective, is the leading actress- Rebecca (stars Ruth Wilson). Ruth is gorgeous, but she's not charming enough to have like 4 or 5 men entirely at her feet. I'm not so familiar with what characters she has played but I know if Rebecca changes to Miranda Kerr or Jessica Alba etc, it will make better sense to the audiences.Other credits I want to say about is the absolutely amazing views of the Western America, which makes me sooooo wanna go there someday! All in all, Depp and William Fichtner are great actors, one plays the queerish man as effortless as he always does, while Fichtner give us a scary horrible villain who can eat human's flesh. I can hardly recognize Fichtner at the first sight as he disguised his teeth, which really makes him scarier. I will definitely introduce this film to my friends because I think it is a fairly nice movie and worth applause.",The Lone Ranger
413,ian-j-williams75,Something wrong with the reviews process,8,4 October 2013,"Sometimes a big budget film like this can be a bit of a disaster and it deserves all the criticism it receives. In this case, I think that a great injustice has been done. 'The Lone Ranger' was a really fun, enjoyable mix of action, comedy and just the right level of darkness to stop it from being twee. I'm really at a loss as to why it flopped at the Box Office. I personally enjoyed this more than films like Star Trek 2 and as one of the best films I've seen this year, I think that it's a real shame it's unlikely to be the start of a new franchise. Why did it flop? It was undoubtedly the ridiculously harsh reviews for this film from most professional critics and, perhaps, the lack of any real desire to see this particular story retold. The cast involved, however, should be proud of this and professional critics should question their role in helping people choose which flicks they should and shouldn't go and see.",The Lone Ranger
414,MCharke,Loved it. A good modern retelling of a classic.,10,4 July 2013,"Why The Lone Ranger (2013) is the best movie of the year (This movie review contains Minor Spoilers.) I fondly remember a much simpler time, when the age of radio programs was fading into memory and in that dying flicker the name that stood for justice. Like the television of that era, the good guys wore white and the bad guys wore black and twirled their mustaches. Director Gore Verbinski's Lone Ranger brings back those feelings in spades.In a summer full of flawed heroes, a narcissist tin man, an alien god whose rampage created untold casualties and an unnecessary romp through the least realistic zombie apocalypse based on the book about the most realistic one, it is refreshing to see a true hero on the big screen. Armie Hammer's Lone Ranger character isn't a good shot and he isn't particularly witty or good with the women. However, he isn't bad at these things either and, more importantly, his incredible moral fiber shows through in every scene and never waivers. Johnny Depp's Tonto dragged me to this movie, but Armie Hammer's Lone Ranger is why I'm going back to see it again.Speaking of Johnny Depp, lets be honest, I want to see Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp delivers with a character that is at the same time unique and yet strikingly reminiscent. Depp and Verbinski treat the Native American aspects of the movie with respect. Many of the jokes are based on taking old clichés and poking holes in them. Depp's makeup, as Tonto, in phenomenal. The movie opens with a display of makeup artistry, at the side-show/museum, that is almost unbelievable and it sets the tone for Tonto throughout.The story isn't a new one. It's the same story you will find in Zorro movies and spaghetti westerns. It's a classic tale of evil out of conquer the world and good trying to stop them with a dash of murder and revenge. The difference is that you have this shining knight of a character who refuses to seek revenge but instead insists on bringing the bad guys to justice.The villain is Butch Cavendish, played by William Fichtner, who begins as a classical disfigured and evil gunslinger and then reveals himself to be worse than that. Tom Wilkinson, who played the very memorable mob boss in Batman Begins, returns as the diabolical railroad tycoon Latham Cole who appears to be using Cavendish as his henchman until the truth comes out later.Like any modern (super) hero movie, the corny one-liners and silly names are used sparingly. Some of the Long Ranger's most famous catch phases appeared only once but they used them all and the crowd cheered each time. Must like the Man of Steel, the Lone Ranger is called by his character's real name, John Reid throughout the movie, giving the movie a less serial and more realistic feel.Silver, the Lone Ranger's white stallion, makes an appearance as a, suspected, supernatural element. Like all such elements in this movie they are carefully crafted so that the viewer may decide if they are real, or imagined. Silver, called only ""horse"" throughout most of the movie, takes on the role of C3P0 or Jimmy Olsen, and injects a good amount of humor into the movie when Depp's Tonto isn't stealing the show with his antics. These often involve the crow on his head whose origin is explained to justify his actions and serves to confirm or rebuke the strongest supernatural elements of the movie.Ruth Wilson plays the strong spirited Rebecca Reid, sought after by just about everyone she runs across until the smoke clears and her ending is revealed. Helena Bonham Carter plays Red Harrington, the one legged ""harlet"" whose artificial leg plays more than a passing role in the movie.For a movie that roams from fighting and acrobatics on horseback to atop trains, or both, the characters are always crystal clear and the backgrounds are always impressive. While there is the bare minimum of required unbelievable scenes, much of the movie is fairly down to earth action. A modern re-telling of an old story, many of the jokes and themes have been updated and while it tugs at the heart like the stories of old, it is shown in a modern frame.The most important element of this movie, for myself, was that they captured the spirit of the Lone Ranger. He had his friend Tonto, his horse Silver. He used silver bullet(s). He wore a mask and he stood for justice. He fought the bad guy without becoming one, or even needing to be a flawed hero. This may indicate the beginning of the end of the reign of the flawed heroes which started with the graphic novels The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen.Mark Charke",The Lone Ranger
415,vrabecj,Good fun,7,14 July 2013,"I wanted to see this movie before all the negative media reviews came out, and almost changed my mind. I am glad I didn't listen to them, this movie was a lot of fun and moved along nicely.I don't really care about movies mirroring their literary or comic book canons as a whole. Judging this movie on it's own merits, my wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly and the audience at our showing did as well. No one got up and walked out and there was a smattering of applause at the end credits, my wife and I included.Depp was excellent and Hammer was a believable Lone Ranger. The cinematography was awesome. Just go see it and have fun!",The Lone Ranger
416,It_Is_Minus_9,The Lone Ranger is great and I will vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise.,9,30 August 2015,"I know John Carter --Disney's other big live-action bomb-- has its share of ardent & vocal fanboys. Well, I think The Lone Ranger deserves that, too. Perhaps, even more-so than Carter. It's a big budget niche movie that deserves to find its audience; one that will embrace it and hopefully sing its praises in the near future as I'm about to do right now.The Lone Ranger is great and I will vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise.I can't think of another film that mythologizes the Old West in such a unique way. It feels like a big screen tall tale, complete with quirky world-building aspects that are stunningly transformative and exciting for this type of film. What other Westerns can you name that feature vast railway conspiracies? Or the intriguingly dark curse of ""Wendigo"" that throws nature so out of balance, it forces animals to cannibalize themselves? This film makes mysticism an acceptable reason for its hero's ability to survive and will to save the day. All of these aspects feel so fresh when put against the backdrop of a genre we're all so certain we're all-too-familiar with.I'll get to Depp in a moment, but I have to say I think Armie Hammer is perfectly cast as The Lone Ranger. With that jawline, he looks like he could have stepped right out of the old serials from the 1920s and 30s. He gets every nuance of the character right, from the unexpected comedic notes to the more obvious action lead stuff. He leaps off the screen in the same way Harrison Ford did in the Indiana Jones movies. This guy simply is this character.Depp is amusing as Tonto, but he is also the one thing that keeps this from being a ""10"" in my book. The framing device of Old Man Tonto narrating the story already feels like an unnecessary element; now add the unsettling elderly make-up and his bizarre acting choices and you've got a weak spot in an otherwise tour de force film.Now, the action set-pieces -- which this movie delivers on tenfold. Nowadays, I'm noticing a trend in big budget movies (mostly comic book movies) where the end battles or story climaxes are short-changed by a short running time. Not The Lone Ranger. Once that final train sequence kicks into gear, and that Ranger theme starts blasting, it's a satisfyingly dense and no-holds-barred experience. No cheap tricks to get out early and save budget. No, no. no. The end sequence is packed with several mini-arcs --a staging and editing device best employed by Spielberg's Indy movies-- that strap you in for what seems like a complete and dense thrill ride that lasts and lasts in the best way possible.I have to hand it to Gore Verbinski. The guy is a visionary director who doesn't get enough cred in nerd circles. I'm not the biggest PoTC fan, but I can recognize his singular talents in every frame of this movie. He's not a generic big budget guy by any stretch. He's got a quirkiness about his work that I find refreshing.And it's all present in The Lone Ranger. So, saddle up for a one-of-a-kind adventure that's just waiting to be discovered!",The Lone Ranger
417,trigunnerd,Not for Kids,3,29 July 2013,"Don't let your kids under 10 see this one. Very violent (even gory, including a main character who practices cannibalism), with innuendo including a brothel and the feeling-up (high up, ""almost there~"") of a woman's fake leg, and some miss-the-mark 'jokes.' Rabbits baring fangs and fighting over a piece of meat-- probably just a splash of Depp's unusual humor, or of Tim Burton in a movie made without him.Additional annoyances: It's a bit lengthy, or so it seemed. Maybe it was just slow at parts. Also, the playing of the theme song (also the William Tell Overture) became annoying, as it was actually repeated FOUR times in a row at the final action scene of the film, then once more later.",The Lone Ranger
418,pancolart,Armie Hammer starring Thomas Jane,6,15 February 2014,"So is this comedy? Why no one warned me this is comedy. I am no mood for comedy. Nevertheless Johnny Depp was quite good. Age and beer belly kind of made him serious and strange enough to play in western. You can also find William Fichtner as bad guy. But he won't scare you. Perhaps with no make up he is indeed scary in the movie he was kind of lame. Appearing and disappearing constantly you get used to him and despite he is supposedly a cannibal he does not deliver. Michael Wiscott comes into my mind instead. And what was that double train chase? Did they really had side by side railways going on each side of a canyon? Perhaps so, but in the movie it seemed far-fetched. As some action stunts. Is director Tim Burton fan? I love Helena Bonham Carter. Movie is watchable, it is funny sometimes and Mr. Depp gets into your heart. Armie Hammer, who is that guy again?",The Lone Ranger

This movie is Amazing.,10,5 October 2013,"I cannot believe this movie flopped at the box office, which makes me really sad cos I was hoping for a second installment. I have always loved the lone ranger adventures, witty, funny stupid and so on. This movie is exactly what you expect only is done is such higher quality. All the actors do a fantastic job, Johnny Depp is amazing as always playing the character of Tonto. The story flows great, stunts and special effect are excellent. I have truly enjoyed this movie and watched more than once and will watch it again and again. Shame on the critics for slaughtering such great movie before it was even released. Hopefully lots of people will still watch this gem and ignore the critics. If you are expecting a serious western then watch something else not the Lone Ranger. the Lone Ranger is meant to be fun and not to be taken too serious. However saying that, this movie has everything and deserve to be watched by everyone(parental viewing is advised though for some part)that enjoy great cinema.

420,horse_pro,Disappointed,4,6 July 2013,I must say I was really looking forward to this movie because when I was young this story and character were a favorite of mine. We went with our Friday night Movie group. Granted we are all baby boomer's but we are a fairly sophisticated group of movie goers. We all went into it with great expectations and without exception were all disappointed. The story was very disjointed and there were scenes that were obviously only in the movie to cater to the CGI fans. Johnny Depp was outstanding as one would expect and the humor of his character was refreshing but not much else was appreciated in this film. We would have been better served as a group to see Despicable Me 2.,The Lone Ranger
421,dean-711-483101,A Break for Tonto,9,31 December 2013,"The very idea of Tonto was at the time originally a reflection of the European invaders better nature toward the natives as was hoped for. Time has revealed since, that any re-consideration for the offspring of the original natives has been shallow at best. The Tonto of this movie is refreshing as far as depiction of fictional historical characters goes. But to be honest with ourselves, it wasn't truly the ""wisdom"" of the native Americans that was ignored but rather their freedom and personal rights. Unless you are glutted with movie watching, this is very entertaining with unexpected turns. While the direction of my thumbs has little meaning to the general public when reviewing movies, I do believe that any recommendation taken seriously should be from a source that shares the same diet of movie watching.",The Lone Ranger
422,criticwithnoname,"Johnny Depp's performance and humor saves ""Lone Ranger"" from an otherwise colossal train wreck.",6,6 July 2013,"The Good: Johnny Depp's performance (and the humor that works): Much like its stylistic predecessor, ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" Johnny Depp's character continues to be the foundation on which all good things in a movie are built. Depp's Tonto is without a doubt the best character in this film in terms of development and interpretation by the actor; much like Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow was in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Unlike ""Pirates"" however, Depp's character has certain limitations caused by the iconic legacy of the source material. Tonto, Spanish for ""fool,"" (when the Lone Ranger is dubbed in Spanish, it becomes ""toro"" for bull in order to avoid offending people), is neither well-spoken nor not witty like Captain Jack Sparrow. In fact his entire existence in the original ""Lone Ranger"" series was to give the Lone Ranger someone to talk to. This notion from the source material becomes a straight jacket for the development of Depp's character. Depp's Tonto is not Depp's Sparrow; Depp mostly resigns himself to adhering to the iconic shtick that made the character so famous: speaking in broken English and assisting the Lone Ranger. But there is no one else who could have done a better job. Depp is excellent as Tonto. A lot of the effective humor also stems from him while much of the other attempts at humor (including a few gags involving a transvestite bandit and the bi-products of horses) fall completely by the wayside. In one sentence Depp makes this movie, his $20 million dollar per movie fee was a good investment. If any other actor attempted this role, it would have undoubtedly failed. The Bad (Forgivable Flaws in the Film): Anti-establishment Subliminal Messaging: In approaching the Lone Ranger source material which is heavily laced with decades of politically incorrect undertones, the filmmakers correctly decided to turn the prejudice on its head. Tonto is actually more of a protagonist in the film than the Lone Ranger and the Indian people are featured in a very favorable light, which is a monumental change compared to how they've been portrayed in previous classic westerns. Conversely, the U.S. cavalrymen are portrayed as inept but well-dressed dandies that would rather dine with railroad tycoons than get their gloves dirty. This in and of itself is very good and manages to turn the traditional western genre on its head. The problem in this movie are the subliminal messaging that happens in the movie, produced and distributed by Disney, ""the all-American, moral authority in media,"" which takes even further potshots at the United States and the Christian establishment. A prime example of the former can be seen in the film's climax where a locomotive dubbed ""Constitution,"" which carries the antagonists, a corrupt railroad tycoon and a wanted outlaw for the whole movie, falls off the cliff. A prime example of the latter revolves around the Lone Ranger's views on religion by refusing to pray with a train full of missionaries because ""The Two Treaties of Government"" by John Locke is his Bible. These missionaries are then seen antagonizing the Lone Ranger as he goes into a house of sin and are portrayed at very sinister angles. Again, I need to stress this isn't a flaw necessarily but considering it comes from Disney, it is baffling. Is the encoding of anti-American/Christian sentiments in their live action movies Disney's new version of drawing phallic symbols and suggestive messages in their animations? The Ugly (Fatal Flaws in the Film): Everything Else: The rest of this movie is a bigger train wreck than the one depicted in the climax of the film. The story is nonsensical and incomprehensible. The narrative is riddled with annoying plot holes and a climax which inexplicably brings poorly developed characters in for no reason to accomplish presumably the same goal without consulting each other. The audience doesn't know this because the narrative doesn't take enough time to give motivations to secondary characters. All the actors, other than Depp portray their characters in a way that is infinitely worse than the way they're developed, this speaks volumes. While the original ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" suffered from all these flaws as well, ""Lone Ranger"" lacks enough smart and fun elements necessary to bring the movie up. The banter, humor, and genuinely fun execution of ""Pirates"" took flaws like the lack of explicit rules of the curse and the stale performances of lesser actors and bettered them with catchphrases like the famous line ""they're not rules so much as guidelines,"" and the situation involving Depp and Bloom clashing swords which started with the line ""You seem somewhat familiar; have I threatened you before?"" and ended with, ""You cheated!"" ""Pirate!"" These catchphrases provide a fun, witty and tongue and cheek tone for the film which makes it easier to accept its flaws. There is no such tone in ""The Lone Ranger."" In additional to the sensitive subject of the confiscation of Native American land and property during westward American expansion, the current Hollywood mantra that every action franchise must be gritty and edgy makes establishing such a tone impossible. Tonto's eccentricities are the result of the traumatic experience of the film's antagonists taking his land and killing his people. The Lone Ranger at first wants to bring villains to justice but after being double-crossed goes out to kill his enemies in the name of ""justice."" The only reason the Lone Ranger cannot make good on this is because the climax which takes place on a runaway train could not feasibly allow it. This trauma and edginess in execution makes the movie's flaws even more noticeable. These harsh elements also influence the overall message of the story which yet again runs contradictory with the spirit of the original source material. This movie begs the question, if this is a true western done in its classical style, and the protagonist kills, should he still wear a white hat?",The Lone Ranger
423,bowlesizhit,Excellent fun flick,9,5 July 2013,"The critics are way off on this one. I almost feel like I watched a different movie than they did. It was a great superhero movie, which is exactly what the Lone Ranger is all about. He is a western superhero. He even has a magical horse as he did in the radio shows. I think they nailed the action, humor, and origin story well. They created a likable Lone Ranger, a funny but wise sidekick in Tonto, and gave him the honor and respect he deserved. However, he had to grow into it which i really liked. Like any good hero, he had to become that hero. He wasn't amazing at first. It's not a thinker, but it was entertaining and fun. I would completely ignore the critics who have their heads up their you know what. Plus, even though it is Disney, it still had it's cool scenes.

424,david-wright96,Another win for Johnny Depp,8,29 August 2013,"When the film started I was a little confused, but I soon caught on. Tonto is telling a young boy about the origins of the lone ranger. I have never seen the television series but I was glad to see they kept some references to the show. Like the William Tell Overture which is the shows theme tune. The name Tonto calls the lone ranger, and of course ""Hey Ho Silver away"" which was said at the end. It is really about the lone ranger but it is Tonto who steals the show. The entire cast was an excellent choice, and performed well. Maybe the reason for the film's box office failure is that Armie Hammer isn't really a big name. He probably is now. Another reason is that it opened around the same time as Despicable Me 2.",The Lone Ranger
425,sheagallagher,The Lone Ranger,7,19 July 2013,"Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer team up once again with Johnny Depp in an attempt to create another action adventure to rival their previous project, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Have they succeeded? Well, not quite.The Lone Ranger gives us a refreshing spin on the legend of lawyer-turned-action-man, John Reid (Armie Hammer), and his adventures in the Wild West with Native American warrior Tonto (Johnny Depp). This movie tells us of how they met, and Reid's quest to deliver justice to the man that killed his brother, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). There's an excellent cast here, with good performances from Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter, but The Lone Ranger is nowhere near as good as it should be.This is not to say, however, that The Lone Ranger isn't entertaining. On the contrary, it provides some good romping action scenes and impressive set pieces, but those expecting action-adventure at the standard of Pirates will be tremendously disappointed.The action scenes are excellent, the first and last being the most memorable. Some of the stunts are absolutely amazing, and there is the same sense of fun during these action scenes that is present in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie just isn't fun. There are some occasional laughs, but the frequency of over-the-top violence makes the romping nature of the film in its entirety non-existent. There is one scene in particular, relatively early in the film, that is easily the most violent scene in the history of Disney movies. The film's big romping set pieces don't come often enough, but when they do they are very satisfying and put a smile on your face. The film looks great, but some of its innards are below par.Johnny Depp brings a bit of humour to his character, and his performance isn't as over-the-top as Jack Sparrow. Maybe this is because Johnny Depp takes the role of Tonto more seriously, or perhaps it is just to make way for Armie Hammer's portrayal of John Reid – the Lone Ranger. Hammer gives a competent performance, but many others could have done the job better. There is chemistry between the two leads, and the acting from the rest of the cast is decent enough, but the plot could be better. At a whopping two and a half hours, the movie does meander a bit, but tries to keep the pace even – with no scenes feeling rushed and very few feeling like they are dragging. All in all, The Lone Ranger provides some entertainment, with enormously impressive visuals and an excellent score from Hans Zimmer, as always, who keeps it faithful to the original adaptations. The violence may be off-putting for some, and the movie does have its flaws, but The Lone Ranger has all the ingredients of a decent film, even if it doesn't exactly follow the recipe. With enough for an enjoyable ride, The Lone Ranger isn't as bad as the critics say, but I can't help feeling a bit disappointed.",The Lone Ranger
426,mersad_92,Do not listen to the critics!,10,26 August 2013,"When I saw the trailer a while ago I really wanted to see this movie. After some bad reviews from critics and other people who went to see the movie I was hesitating to go. Today I went anyway and I had a great experience. The first 10-15 minutes were a bit slow, and at that point I thought the critics were right. But after that, the film really started to pick up a nice pace. There was enough to laugh throughout the whole movie, not to much, just a nice touch of humor that just really made me laugh. Johnny Depp just always steals the show in everything he does. Armie Hammer did a fine job too. I've read not everybody was too happy about his performance but I think there was nothing wrong with it. Helena Bonham Carter didn't have a very big part, I wish we could have seen more of her, but this woman can steal the show in 10 seconds, I just like everything she does. William Fichtner and Tom Wilkinson played their part very well, just as everybody else. I enjoyed the spectacular action scenes, especially towards the end of the movie, combined with the music it just gave me chills. Shots of beautiful old western US landscape surely made the movie even more impressive. But the movie is not all about action and humor, it certainly contains a message and I really enjoyed the movies plot, which has some nice twists in it I can tell you. A lot of things aren't what they seem to be. The key word is greed. *This may be a small spoiler* Greed from some ''white people'' towards the Indians. Greed brings out the worst in people, and this movie showed that in an impressive way. So it's just not humor and action, but a movie with a great message. It touched the rich history of the Indians, and I enjoyed that. I'd really recommend this movie, despite what the critics say.",The Lone Ranger

But after actually seeing the film, I found it to be worse than anything I could have imagined. Think of ""The Three Stooges Go West"" but include a scene of Indians being massacred by the calvary, immediately followed by a joke by Tonto about the Lone Ranger's horse. (That comment was unfair to the Stooges because they were actually funny.) The director seemed to ad-lib the tone of the film on the fly going from corny (and very predictable) jokes to something I suppose was meant to be pathos. Armie Hammer will be embarrassed by this performance for the rest of his career. George Clooney keeps a picture of himself as Batman to remind him to never again take a role just for the money. Depp had better hang his image of himself as Tonto close by to remind him not to take another role like this that might end his career. Depp has been very popular because of his clever portrayals of both comic and serious characters but I will be far less anxious to see his next picture after this disaster.",The Lone Ranger
428,hughesreviews-co-uk,"The Lone Ranger' has plenty of merits but at an unjustifiable 150 minutes and with a mumbled focus, it starts to feel less like an adventure and more like a test of patience.",6,1 November 2013,"""Hi-Yo, Silver! Away"" The Lone Ranger proclaims; as he has done since the characters conception since 1933. Only to be told, ""Don't ever do that again"" by his trusty Native American sidekick Tonto. 'The Lone Ranger' is another Hollywood project that has taken an old property (very old) and tried to add a screenwriter's twist and market it to the contemporary masses.1869: civilization is coming to the Wild West in the form of iron tracks and the steam that rolls across it. Butch Cavendish, the last of the dying outlaws – played fiercely by William Fichtner – is being transported across the state for hanging in the same train carrying geeky lawyer John Reid and Comanche Native American Tonto. When Butch's gang stage a rescue, it brings into play a motion of events that force Reid to take up a Ranger's role and reluctantly team up with Tonto to bring this murderer to justice. They ultimately uncover more than what meets the eye.The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' team – Gore Verbinski, Jerry Bruckheimer and Johnny Depp – take the responsibility of bringing Disney's wild west vision to life. In many ways, they succeed. I am no fan of 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, and even though it is obvious to see the similar style of action and comedy in 'The Lone Ranger', I found this to be a more aesthetically impressive film. This is a huge movie; with a budget at around $250 million! Those extraordinary vistas show it. The money can be seen on screen through the impressive size, scope and technical competence of the production. Those guys did their job and Disney should be pleased, even if the marketing team did not do theirs. 'The Lone Ranger' barely made its money back at the box-office; which must have surprised the studio who most likely assumed they were on to a winner. It ticks all the blockbuster boxes but for some reason or another, it never took traction.My theory for its financial failure comes down to the fact thatdeep breaththe film is not that great. I have never shied away from bombarding accusations to the mainstream audience that they are misguided in what they decide to make successful; but could this be a change of direction? A new age when a films success depends on its quality? A revolution against the might of Disney? No. Don't be silly. But at least we are not giving the Major's exactly what they expect of us all the time.Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer – who play Tonto and The Lone Ranger respectively – can have a go at me all they want; like they have done other critics (cause they obviously know I exist), but a really long script and an overly long plot just drains the merits of the film. 'The Lone Ranger' will make you laugh a fair few times, but it is only a slight reprieve from 150 minutes of boredom. Even the action sequences are incomprehensible and boring. Which are two adjectives you could also use to describe the development of our uninteresting hero. Armie Hammer tries too hard, acting overly nerdy and when he does, finally, transition into the heroic Lone Ranger, it just comes out of nowhere for an unconvinced audience. Johnny Depp was hard to take as a Native American; even if I do think he is a great actor and performer. One thing about his performances is that you can usually see his inspirations. Jack Sparrow was an obvious imitation of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards and with Tonto, you can't help but be reminded of a Buster Keaton silent comedy. I don't know about you, but I prefer John Dillinger, 'Public Enemies' Johnny Depp, rather than comedy performance Jack Sparrow. Oh, just in case you did not believe it was enough of a Johnny Depp film, they throw in Helena Bonham Carter briefly; who turns up rather ridiculously with a wild west equivalent of a 'Planet Terror' gun leg/leg gun.There is an obvious affection of this dead genre, and American actors clearly love playing Cowboys and Indians. After Verbinski and Depp made 'Rango', a love letter to the Western genre through an animated comedy, they proved their love ten folds. Like 'Rango', 'The Lone Ranger' owes everything to Sergio Leone, John Ford and Clint Eastwood. While there are no references as obvious as having The Man With No Name pop up in the film (like 'Rango'), the DNA of these Western legends are evident in every frame. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack seems to take direct notes and chimes from many iconic Ennio Morriconne musical scores that feature in 'Once Upon A Time In The West' and 'For A Few Dollars More'.The saving grace of the film is that is is not 'Man of Steel'. Don't get me wrong, I really liked 'Man of Steel, but I find it to be a strange and effective point of comparison due to the approach 'The Lone Ranger' did not take. Zack Snyder had no self-aware jokes, and took 'Man of Steel' all very seriously, but 'The Lone Ranger' plays it all for laughs and plays to the audiences expectations of the characters. While 'Man of Steel' ignores Superman's cultural associations by refusing to give the audience the famous John Williams score, 'The Lone Ranger' embraces it. When William Tell's overture eventually echoes through the cinema, like a ballad of wild west nostalgia, you start to wish that you were that young child again, who played Cowboys and Indians in the garden. It has an innocent joy no matter how much money backs it. That is not something you can say about a lot of big movies today.Like this review?

429,tac-15,Hi-Ho-Hum,2,6 July 2013,"Waste of time, this one. Not a revival of the classic Western genre. What were the Hollywood demagogues trying to prove? It is NOT your classic ""Hi-Ho, Silver!"" It's another leftist, radical, ""let's beat up on the white/European types who caused us all this grief"". Very booooring, too. And Johnny Depp looks more like something that crawled out of ""Night of the Living Dead Zombies"" rather than a Native American. And who said the Lone Ranger wears a mask because he is ashamed of his people? This was a real ""High Ho-Humm"" and well panned by the critics. Moreover, THIS is the film they chose to release on INDEPENDENCE DAY!!! It's about as UN-Americana as one could get. Hope they all catch a spur where it hurts. Yuck!!",The Lone Ranger
430,christopherelawrence,The Lone Ranger? I do not think so.,1,14 March 2014,"I would like to say one thing before I start out on this rant against this film: I never, ever, expected to agree with a critic on any film, because they really do not know how the audience thinks. However, when it comes to this film, I agree with them that it was one of the most ridiculous pieces of celluloid on screen.To start, I am very familiar with the original character of the Lone Ranger, and have had the opportunity to listen to the radio program and to see the TV series and movies from the 50's with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. Although they, according to the now present populace of people, may be hokey, they continue to provide morals and good Christian character, which, frankly, I believe is more necessary today in a world which is quite literally going to the dogs.Now to the points of this diatribe, which will start with #1.1: John Reid/Lone Ranger. Again, as with the film from the 80's, he is again introduced as a lawyer who is moving to the west to start a law practice. I had no problem with this, except that I found the character expressed in this film to be dull, uninteresting, and essentially a wimp. Unlike the wonderful portrayal Moore did of a man who was courageous with great intelligence and yet still exhibited the frailties of man, this version of Reid came off as someone who came onto the scene as a Greenhorn. You would think that as one who was raised in the West he would have been more seasoned to the situation presented even if he did leave to go east for a while.2. Tonto. Johnny Depp. Where in the world do I start with this? Jay Silverheels portrayal of the character (and even the character on the radio program), even though he was created in a time when Indians and others of different ethnicities were not given the proper respect, was in the end the equal to the Ranger in every way. Yes, he had the clipped English, and his name may have meant ""fool"", but he was not that way at all. Yet, unfortunately, the word Fool seems to describe Depp's portrayal of the Ranger's Sidekick, if not the word Loon. His character was described as one who, once he lost his tribe, became a mental case because of the guilt that he felt at the loss, because he believed that it was his fault. Believe it or not, I had no problem with this at all, since as a people many of us may have felt the same. Unfortunately, instead of Depp's Tonto working his way through it and coming to a settlement, his insanity became more enhanced, and essentially turned a character of nobility into a embarrassment. The dead bird on his head (and him trying to feed it) only exemplified this. 3. Cavendish. Essentially the classic villain of the Ranger, who led the gang that ambushed the Rangers that were led into the pass and killed his brother. Cavendish's character, as he was presented in the movie, was necessarily evil, but when seen as a cannibal it was something that was unnecessary to the plot. His association with the Railroad Man and Tonto's back-story was also not necessary and not needed at all.4. Dan Reid. For this character, I will say that, as long as he was on the screen, he was presented decently as a man that worked feverishly as a lawman to support his wife and son, as any man has ever done or ever will do. The triangle with himself, his wife, and his brother (who, we see in the film, apparently has deep feelings for his brother's wife, yet knows that he cannot act on his feelings) was also an element that was not needed but seemed to be put in the plot because the writers likely felt that the movie needed a sexual component to bring in audiences.To conclude with this evaluation, when it came to the film itself, I felt that the ambush that led to the death of the Rangers and Dan Reid itself was quite detailed and accurate and easily is seen as a equal to what was presented in the TV Show and on the radio program. As for the rest, the dialog was terrible, and the film itself was no different than others in that it concentrated more on over the top action and spectacle than in a understandable story. Even the elements that were always associated with the Lone Ranger, such as the call of ""Heigh O Silver, Away!"" and the silver bullets were turned into a joke, and only extinguished what good spirits and expectations I had for a good film through out the movie. (When it comes to the rabbits, do not get me started with those things!)One thing that I do know: If Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels were alive today, they would have likely been as turned off at this film as I was. Moore, as long as he lived, continued to spread and give others hope through the morality of the character that he portrayed, even many years after the TV show ended, and this is the way that I want to remember the character that he gave life to.",The Lone Ranger

The makers of another up market fiasco, 'World War Z', discovered this too. Unfortunately, he blows out of this film almost as soon as he blew in, and takes any reasons to keep watching with him.

I really enjoy this movie for its pure entertainment value and how it uplifts your spirit like the movies and TV series of yesteryear such as High Noon, Swiss Family Robinson, Davy Crockett, The Rifleman, and Daniel Boone. It impacts you emotionally when you watch and it has witty, subtle humor, great action sequences, excellent photography, amazing theme music, and costumes and makeup that really capture the dusty spirit of the old west. I really like John Reid's noble character, vulnerability, high ideals, and that he grows into becoming the hero of the Lone Ranger through trials and tribulation. I also really love Tonto's dry one-liners, and how he lovingly makes fun of 'Kemosabe' like a big brother would.

From the meaningless slaughter of people to the lamest soundtrack ever made by Hans Zimmer this was a prolonged pain to watch.""Something is very wrong with that horse"" is a remark made by Tonto (Johnny Depp) and stands out as the most precise there is to say about the whole movie.Guns and ammunition with properties of state of the art military equipment post 2000, the use of Latin names for muscles, references to brain functions and pharmaceuticals unknown to the time period, and people deliberately aiming above the person they are supposed to be shooting at are all examples of the folly that completely ruins the story.I'll just stop here and try and find a way to get rid of my disappointment.",The Lone Ranger
437,mcroyle,Third act is a completely different movie.,4,12 July 2013,"Let's just put it this way: I was into ""The Lone Ranger"" until the third act when it got way out of control and over-the-top campy. The cinematography was fantastic, direction from Gore was his standard, but the writing of the third act threw me for a loop. While the rest of the story was pretty grounded, the third act felt like a different movie. I love a good Western, and back in the day Hollywood studios made some great ones. However, studio executives today don't have any idea of how to make a genre flick - and more than half of them don't even know what the word 'genre' means. There have been some amazing modern Western genre flicks, but this isn't one of them. It started out that way, but it turned into a Summer popcorn flick. Hammer's title character was a bit off. He's too much of a pretty boy to be in a Western to begin with. Depp's Tonto was pretty much watching Jack Sparrow in a different wardrobe. Kids will be bored until the third act, and scholarly fans will be disappointed in seeing what starts out as a decent Western dissolve into an eye-candy act three. Overall, I'm going to have to throw this flick a grade of D+. Wait for the DVD release. It's nothing you haven't seen before.",The Lone Ranger

It is a pleasure to sit in the cinema with pop corn at hand to enjoy the two-and-a-half-hour movie.To be honest, the plot is a little bit too simple. Takes me less than half-hour to figure out who the baddie is. Still, I like it, esp. the part of white horse running on top of the train with a background of symphonic music. Is this something borrowed from Apocalypse Now (fleet of choppers cruising in the background of Wagner)?For the plot, it looks like to be a mix of Once Upon a Time in the West 1968 (the train, and the beautiful widow) + Zorro 1975 (man with eye-mask on horseback) + Dance with Wolves (the story of Indians, and their conflict with whites).Just one question: In the end, why Tondo asked John Reid to stop waving his hat in hi-ho silver?",The Lone Ranger
439,abhirahul,Finally watched it against all the negative reviews and thank god I did,9,13 October 2013,"As a fan of Pirates series and Gore Verbinski's fantasy world, I was eagerly waiting for this movie to come out. But all the extreme negative reviews left a lingering doubt it in me, forcing me to avoid the theaters for this one. After finally watching it on DVD, that is the only thing I regret.It's really an all round fun movie with good character/story development and some really fascinating action and thrills. Johnny Depp as Tonto reminds us the fun he had playing Captain Jack Sparrow, especially in the part-I of Pirates series. Annie Hammer as the Ranger might have been a bold choice given his nascent star status, but every star was a newbie someday. He earnestly plays his part. William Fichtner is menacing and Tom Wilkinson fits his role well. The direction and story telling was impressive, which I have found lacking in some of the recent blockbusters (most notably Hunger Games). The Western concept has been captured nicely and the train sequences are fun to watch. People have complained at times of its length, but it all seemed to be a part of character development for me. Recent films have either very hurried approach or such a slow development that it bores you. TLR found a good balance for me. If you haven't watched it, catch it on DVDs with an open mind and you will definitely enjoy it.",The Lone Ranger

As a comedy, it wasn't funny, although I might have missed a few witty bits when the voice mix lost out to the background din.Overall, all I saw was a slow-motion re-hashed western which was neither funny, dynamic or worth wasting time on, with the climax being the last-minute cramming-in of the stupid CGI horse rearing to the sound of ""Hi-yo-Silver"", to appease the fans (?) of the Lone Ranger.It would appear that this movie was the ""pilot"" for a forthcoming franchise.

444,beansproutlord,Reviewers secretly disliked this because it was too serious,9,10 October 2013,"Anyone who has read Howard Zinn's 'A People's History of the United States' will know all about America's long history of exploitation and violence against the weak and vulnerable in their own society as well as other peoples. Astute students of world history will note that every wealthy nation became wealthy at the expense of the peaceful, the innocent, the weak and the poor, whether it be England, Germany, Spain or the US of A.However, it's a predictable fact that the more comfortable and wealthy an individual gets, the less they'll want to hear this simple truth. And paid reviewers and critics tend to be fairly financially comfortable.This is why I believe this movie was slated by the critical journalistic fraternity.It is a hyper-real summer blockbuster type-movie, yes, but it also wears a simple message on its sleeve: That the wealthy entity we call America was built out of greed for material wealth, and the bodies of the poor, minorities and native peoples were mercilessly used as mortar for that building. And the movie makes it clear that this state of affairs continues to this day, and that it's up to each of us to do what we can to change things for the better.There's no other reason that establishment critics would savage the product of one of their own wealthy studios in the way that they have this movie. After all, it's an exciting movie, with good pacing, a great cast and solid performances. And for movie buffs, there are little nods and homages to the western genre everywhere, from little costume touches to motifs in the soundtrack. Seven stars for being a fun blockbuster, and the extra two for having a dissident, serious political message, and some genuinely harrowing and sad scenes to drive the point home.

There's good action and, for the most part, good character development. I do think the movie would have been better as just a straight western. Depp's character is somewhat funny, but it always seems like he's trying to tap into the humor/craziness of Captain Jack Sparrow. And while his lines might be funny, the rest of cast doesn't really mesh with that type of character. I also think they could have developed Hammer's character a bit more, especially his relationship with his brother.

446,Jack_LesCamela,My review of THE LONE RANGER,9,4 February 2015,"Negative snark before anyone even saw the movie came in two kinds: Those who thought it racist to cast Johnny Depp as Tonto, and those who thought it a bad idea to make the movie at all.Johnny Depp having some Native American blood and being proud of that part of his ancestry in interviews going back twenty-five years counted for nothing. The film production courting the Commanche community and Depp being made an honorary member of the tribe didn't matter. The biggest movie star on the planet wanted to play Tonto; was the only reason the movie got greenlit at all, but you don't understand: He lacks the requisite genetic bona fides. He's no Jay Silverheels.Yeah, about that. Jay Silverheels played Tonto on The Lone Ranger TV series of the 1950s. To some people, Silverheels' performance is better and worthier than Johnny Depp's could ever be because you know, he was a full blooded Mohawk. But have you watched episodes of The Lone Ranger lately? Silverheels did the best anyone could with what is a total nothing part. Tonto is there only to serve his white kemosabe. The fact they got a real Native American to play that nonsense doesn't mean we should accord it more praise than it deserves. Ideally the complainers wanted someone like Adam Beach or Lou Diamond Phillips to be cast. They mean well, but that line of thinking is creatively limited and leads to hewing too close to crappy tradition. I've seen Depp's performance criticized variously as being a racist cliché and as being nothing more than Jack Sparrow in the Wild (Wild) West. It can't be both, so which is it?Actually? It's neither. Depp famously took Rolling Stone Keith Richards as inspiration for his career defining role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies. Once it was pointed out, it was obvious: He seems permanently intoxicated, is always slightly slurring his words, he dresses a bit like a gypsy, and his body language is loose and fluid like the rum he clamors for.Depp's Tonto is miles away from that. He's quiet and determined where Sparrow was flamboyant and dissolute. He moves with smooth precision while all around him is chaos. He's a planner not a schemer --the definition being that a planner focuses on how to solve a problem, while a schemer's focus is on manipulating someone else in solving it. In short: Depp plays Tonto as Buster Keaton, ""the Great Stone Face"" of silent film comedy, with a left turn at the Jay Silverheels. You can see it in the deadpan facial expressions (the white warpaint helps with this tremendously and more about that later), the body language, and if you still don't get it: The finale is an extended tribute to the two train chase in Keaton's THE GENERAL.What Depp takes from Silverheels are his speech patterns. It's a nice nod because to millions of people, that what Tonto sounds like. Depp's turn is a more interesting conversationalist though. It builds to subversive effect when the Lone Ranger meets some Commanche elders and none of them talk like Tonto. In fact, they think he's a bit touched in the head. They're saying, we know our ways are strange to you, white man, but Tonto is an eccentric weirdo even by our standards.Here Tonto's given a backstory and motivation of his own ala Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. He's a man without a tribe, separated from his people and society because of a tragedy he feels responsible for. He's given --dare I say it-- a personality.Which is refreshing. Tonto is for once shown to be more than just his race, more than just the Lone Ranger's trusty Indian companion. Not being a full blooded Native American himself, Depp doesn't see the character as a spokesperson for Native Americans everywhere. Which frees him to do what real artists always do: Take inspiration and use it to create something new.Complainers singled out Tonto's strange look, saying it wasn't in accordance with any tribal tradition; but they missed the whole point. Like the Lone Ranger, this Tonto has his own mask. It's one he wears for his own reasons and never takes off. If you doubt what I'm saying, just look at the advertising logo and tell me whose eyes those are behind the mask. Which brings us to the Lone Ranger himself, played by Armie Hammer. I've heard criticism about how the movie treats the character, saying it's not respectful. If you go back to TV and radio show though, you see the Ranger was never cool. He didn't shoot to kill - ever. Didn't drink, smoke, cuss, or show an interest in the ladies. He's the man who'd go into the toughest saloon in town and order a glass of milk.Despite what you've heard, the movie doesn't ridicule the character. What it does is stay true to the ""straight arrow"" children's hero created by Fran Striker in 1933. The twist is everyone else (including Tonto) react to it the way people actually would. Which is funny. In the end, he still wins against the bad guys on his own terms --which is even better.What else? The movie tells the story of how John Reid became the Lone Ranger, famous from both radio and TV. The cinematography is beautiful and shows off Monument Valley better than anyone since John Ford. It has an old fashioned sense of storytelling informed not just by Ford but by Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Also: Not an overabundance of CGI. Those are real trains and horses, people.The movie runs a bit long, but it's a feast for all that. There's adventure, humor, a touch of the gruesome, some intense action, and heart and spirit to spare here.",The Lone Ranger
447,kcalbertina59,"Tonto...er...The Lone Ranger is not great, but reasonably entertaining",7,5 July 2013,"Is The Lone Ranger a great movie? Not really, but it is relatively entertaining.Is the movie slow in the middle? A little, but not as bad as most critics would have you believe.The Lone Ranger is a bit long and does ask you to be patient at times, something that seems to be lost in the modern video-game world we live in.The strength of the movie lies squarely with Johnny Depp and his portrayal of Tonto. I seriously doubt that any other actor could have pulled it off. Depp deadpans through several one-liners, which gives us much of the movie's humor. In Depp's capable hands, the character of Tonto is both admirable and witty, with a charm all his own.The first part of the movie definitely gets us started with a bang. It does jump around quite a bit in the first few scenes, which seemed a little disjointed at times, but things are tied together well enough as the movie progresses.The middle of the movie is slower, but we are provided with many of the answers as to the back history of the characters, especially with Tonto and the villains. I will agree that the movie could have accomplished the same with five to ten less minutes, but that is certainly not an adequate reason, in itself, to skewer the film.And the last few scenes are the non-stop action sequences that most modern audiences love, although they do almost come off as cartoonish at times.As stated, Depp's performance is the single biggest selling point for this movie. I thought William Fichtner was very good as Butch Cavendish, the film's main villain. Tom Wilkinson, James Badge Dale, Ruth Wilson, and Helena Bonham Carter all lend excellent support.Of the movie's title character, I'm not sure that someone else other than Armie Hammer wouldn't have made a better Lone Ranger. That being said, the interactions and dialog between him and Depp's Tonto are enjoyable and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. In many ways, this is a buddy movie, albeit with a bit of a twist.Perhaps, one of the main reasons critics dislike the movie is its title. For all intents and purposes, this is really a Tonto movie. It is more his story and told from his point of view. It probably should have properly been called Tonto. But I don't see that as being a bad thing at all.If you take it for what it is, The Lone Ranger is a reasonably entertaining film, with a very strong performance by Depp. And that was enough for me to give it a 7 out of 10.",The Lone Ranger

450,gerold-firl-279-327147,best western,9,8 July 2013,"Just saw Lone Ranger and loved it. It's currently running a 6.8 on IMDb, and that's an underestimation. I'm wondering why.I guess I can understand why Republicans, fundies and other right-wing nutjobs might be offended. The film portrays the combination of capitalism and militant imperialism in a negative light, and for the aforementioned mouth-breathers that makes it ""anti-American"". It also pokes a little fun at religious fanatics, which is guaranteed to get the wackos in a tizzy. However, for anyone with a functional sense of humor and any kind of respect for truth and honesty, this is a very enjoyable movie.It is a fact that greed and brutality fueled a combination of big business, the American military, and free-lance murderers to take the land of the American Indians and nearly wipe them off the map. This movie does not flinch from showing that element of our history. Movie- goers who can't handle that kind of truth may not enjoy seeing it on the big screen. It could also be argued that the film treats this unhappy history too lightly - it is a very funny movie - but I think it finds the right balance. It's an entertaining movie that is seriously funny. I think it's the best western we've seen for a long time (unless you call Django Unchained a western) but it doesn't have the authentic period flavor of True Grit. If we compare to comedy westerns such as Blazing Saddles, Lone Ranger is far superior in every way. But even alongside serious westerns like True Grit and Unforgiven, Lone Ranger holds up. It looks at the larger socio- historical issues of Manifest Destiny in a way those movies don't. Although it's very humorous, it also lifts the veil on the realities of truth, justice, and the American way. Even though Lone Ranger was a box-office disappointment for the studio, it'll have legs. It's a quality film.",The Lone Ranger
451,bilal406111,an up average movie,8,1 August 2013,"This is movie is a good above average movie.with stars like johnny Depp and Armie Hammer this movie is a very good treat to watch.The film stars Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto, these two have great chemistry that really shows, The Lone Ranger also stars Helena Bonham Carter, William Fichtner, and Tom Wilkinson.Once again Disney, Bruckheimer and Depp make for an excellent movie experience. When you watch a television show in black and white growing up, you don't always know what to expect as an adult to see it as a feature length film. I enjoyed this movie tremendously. The storytelling and writing was excellent. The fact that Lone Ranger isn't a ""Disney character"" meant that I had no other reference but the television show to go on. This is one you have to pay attention to. Don't get up in the middle to get a refill on your popcorn because you may very well miss part of the story. Depp plays an older tormented Tonto sharing his experiences meeting the Lone Ranger with a young boy who attends the local carnival. And so the story begins. The element of greed in American history and what it can influence people to do is closely examined throughout the film. Therefore you get entertainment and a lesson and it's cleverly written so that even young adults will get it. No need to explain how dad and granddad use to watch it in black and white back in the day. This is one of the better ""reboots"" of the summer.",The Lone Ranger

453,janmejay-vyas,"Depp shines, The Lone Ranger entertains!",7,25 June 2013,"Quite frankly, I was highly skeptical on attending the screening of the hugely anticipated Johnny Depp, Arnie Hammer starrer The Lone Ranger, primarily because I am not such a huge fan of western movies plus a runtime clocking almost 150 minutes seemed to long to handle. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try owing to the Depp factor and the director, Gore Verbinsky who has a pretty neat track record as a director.I haven't actually seen The Lone Ranger T.V series which aired from 1949-1957, so I pretty much knew nothing about the characters as such and went in with a clean slate, which in my opinion is a good thing as it removed unwarranted comparisons and biasness.Settling down in my seat and 10 minutes into the movie, I was hooked on. A spectacular opening scene, where the outlaws make away with their chief held captive and being transported on a train. The scene introduces us to the principal characters of the movie namely Tonto (Johnny Depp), John Reid (Arnie Hammer) and Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Verbinsky establishes his characters smoothly and seamlessly throughout the narrative which is definitely one of the high points of the movie. The entire story unfolds as Tonto, recounts the tales of his journey and how John Reid becomes The Lone Ranger. The two form an uncanny team to bring Cavendish to justice, each in his own manner. John believes in non-violence and the court of law and Tonto is just the opposite. The two share an electrifying chemistry and Depp gets his comic timing spot on as the quirky Tonto. Tonto, belongs to a native American warrior tribe, who feels responsible for the death of his fellow men and his family owing to a trade he made with two white Americans he saved from certain death when he was a child. John seeks revenge from Cavendish as he is responsible for the death of his ill-fated brother Dan Reid.(James Badge Dale).Inspite of its length, the movie never drags or feels lethargic at any point of time, instead it provides a good dose of laughter at regular intervals and Depp shines in those scenes. The scenes where the Native American, trades a feather or grains for everything he steals from dead people or the scene where the white stallion chooses John over his brother, and Tonton repeatedly tries to force the stallion to switch the selection, Depp is just fantastic.Depp rises above his co-stars with his impeccable comic timing and one liners. The best facet to his character is the fact that he is so unpredictable. You never know what is he going to do next. Arnie Hammer pitches in an earnest performance and nicely complements Depp. Despite, all its triumphs it does have a couple of blemishes. It's understandable that the entire writing revolved around the two principal characters, John and Tonto and I'm guessing due to the focus on these two characters some other supporting characters got sidelined. The sub plot involving Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) and her relationship with John is half baked and is not well developed. Similarly, Helena Bonham Carter as Red Harrington is unconvincing as the deadly leggie and neither does her character get enough screen time leave a mark.Barring the two minor hiccups, The Lone Ranger overall is a fine movie which is high on entertainment value. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone who seeks a good time at the movies. Fun guaranteed!",The Lone Ranger
454,negararepublikindonesia,"Two men, one feel of cowboy",8,11 July 2013,"For me, this movie is like the climax of all Johnny Depp great performances and it is the presence of Johnny Depp himself which can help full the original story of the film. The movie is Depp-ep. One thing that I have to critic on this movie is the emerging of mentality of an American-Indian (Injun) that comes to Johnny Depp's acting. Why? Because Johnny Depp closes that figure within the acting of himself, the acting of Johnny Depp as great actor. It could be better if Johnny Depp could present the acting of an American-Indian (Injun). That's why, I could only see the story line of a Cowboy or a Ranger. Other aspects are great that I can't send any critics. Good luck to Johnny Depp, you are my best Hollywood actor ever loved!",The Lone Ranger
455,norrisj15,The Lone Ranger: Spaghetti Western Resivisted,3,21 July 2013,"http://filmthroughmyeyes.blogspot.comPreface: I will kind of spoil this movie, although, if you couldn't figure out how this movie was going to play out after the first 5 minutes you might need to have some alone time to think about what you've done. I will leave out the very few unpredictable things to keep the movie somewhat a surprise.INTRO:A revamp of the legendary Sunday morning television show The Lone Ranger offered an opportunity for a different generation to be introduced to the western gunslinger and his iconic Native American partner, Tanto. The film also revived a classic western style of cinematography mixed in with the polish of the modern movie industry. ACTING:The headliner and pretty much the only reason I even went to see this movie was Johnny Depp in his roll of Tanto. Much like many of Depp's roles, he is in a very unique costume and takes on a persona never be seen before from him. All things considered, I enjoyed Tanto very much. Depp's voicing of the character was spot on and made the best of his awkward timed deliveries and witty comebacks. Depp delivers like always.Armie Hammer (yep that's really his name kind of awesome but kind of like North West too obvious at the same time) plays the lone ranger. He is most recognizable from his role as the Winklevoss brothers in The Social Network if you remember those guys at all. Armie manages to pull of the look of the lone ranger thanks to fantastic costume work. His acting isn't bad considering how bad the writing in this movie was. The best acting performance of the flick was surprisingly not Depp but William Fichtner as Butch Cavendish. You'll recognize him as the bank manager from the Dark Knight. The guy with the shot gun in the first scene with the Joker and the bus. He's in plenty of other movies, TV shows and video games you'd recognize the titles of but not necessarily him. Anyways, he was much like Armie aided by some amazing makeup and costume work, but the theatrics aside, William delivered line after line spot on. He developed his character enough for the audience to hate him without really knowing why. I think the best part about his performance was the overall manner in which he carried himself. His body language, posture, and movements were lessons in acting every second. He embodied his character in every way possible. TAKEAWAYS:As a Disney movie, the plot was most likely written by one of the mouseketeers. Every ""twist"" and ""turn"" is ridiculously obvious and the entire movie can be predicted after about five minutes of watching the film. That said, the film is much in the style of the original Lone Ranger and westerns of the time. The almost corny, spaghetti western is emulated in this revamp of the 1950's hit. The makeup and costumes are very well done as they are in most Disney movies. This is the sharpest part of the movie by far. Fichtner's acting performance is one to watch, but nothing to remember for much longer than the two hours of film duration. Depp performs but not one of his legendary level performances we have become accustomed to over his impressive career. I hate the alterations done to Tanto's costume. It makes him perceived entirely differently from the TV show.At the end of the day, I would not recommend seeing this flick unless you have very deep ties to the original. Much of the plot line and characters follow the first few episodes of the original TV show, so die-hard fans will have something to cling to as a redeeming factor. For the rest of us, stay away from this one and give your money to your IRA or 401k's. That's always good advice, but all joking aside, save your money; Disney doesn't deserve it for this movie.RATING:The film gets 1.5/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups.",The Lone Ranger
456,Ed_D17,"An great, entertaining film, unfairly ganged up upon.",8,6 January 2014,"""The first forty-five minutes are excellentthe next forty-five minutes are a little soporific... Then comes the train scene—incredible! When I saw it, I kept thinking, 'What, that's the film that everybody says is crap? Seriously?""That's not me who said that, that was Quentin Tarantino, and I think he's spot on. Critic after critic lined up to slate this film, but what element of it? The quality of the film? I doubt it, because this film is not deserving of many of the negative reviews it's received. Its budget? The fact it was delayed? Perhaps that's what they're reviewing. Whatever the case, it was the critics who discouraged me from paying to see this film when it was released, despite the fact I thought it looked good, and it was only a cheap deal at a local retailer that made me pick it up. But I'm sure glad I did. Another member of the team who worked on ""The Lone Ranger"", though I can't remember whom exactly, has said that this film will be one people will look back on favourably in ten years and, again, I think he's spot on. Because ""The Lone Ranger"" is brilliant.There's undeniably a large focus on action and it can get a little silly at times but the film has plenty of other substance to it. The plot is fantastic, not at all linear, and full of twists and turns with moments that can shock or change your perspective of a character altogether. It's a beautifully put-together film. The character development and acting on the whole is also superb. The development of John Reid's (Armie Hammer) character is pleasing to watch unfold and the way in which we learn more of the true nature and motives of many of the characters, most notably Tonto (Johnny Depp) and Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) is fantastic. Armie Hammer is a fantastic John Reid, both charismatic and funny, without being too heroic. Whilst Johnny Depp's Tonto is undeniably similar to his role as Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", that's Johnny Depp's problem, not ours. In fact, it's great to see such a wonderful persona make a reappearance, especially as we see more of Tonto's motives coming through. Finally, Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) is an absolutely brilliant villain, superbly acted. The visuals of the film are also spectacular, offering some stunning vistas of the good ol' Wild West, which really help define the setting for the film, and some great special effects which don't fall into the trap of becoming to frequent, so only add to the already fantastic plot. ""The Lone Ranger"" is, of course, not without its flaws, but they are not so many as several critics would have you believe. The method in which the story is told is unnecessary (though admittedly is useful in one instance) and slows down what would otherwise be a good-paced film. Finally, though the comedy is usually brilliant, it does get a little silly at times.In summary, ""The Lone Ranger"" is simply fun. It's not at all what the critics would have you believe, rather an entertaining ride with a fantastically complex plot and plenty of twists and turns, augmented by some great characters, acting and effects. This is a film to be watched and re-watched.",The Lone Ranger
457,jhathawaywilson,Brilliant and entertaining. The Lone Ranger will send you on a wild ride you'll never forget!,10,27 April 2014,"Action-packed, humorous and very entertaining... How much better can The Lone Ranger get? Sometime last year, I went to see The Lone Ranger one of the first days it was released. After hearing what the critics had said about it I wasn't too sure about it, but that afternoon I realized it was a two and a half hours well spent! The cast was very well chosen. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp were brilliant playing The Lone Ranger and Tonto, two incredible characters. There were other actors who were excellent in the film as well, such as Tommy Lee-Jones and Helena Bonham Carter. We also had William Fichtner who was great at playing the villainous Butch Cavendish, another brilliant character. Unfortunately, it was the critics who thought the casting wasn't half as good as I've said. Johnny Depp was nominated worst actor in the Razzi awards. I mean really, look at the character of Tonto, who else is gonna play him better than Johnny Depp? The humor and action was another thing that added to the films greatness. All through the movie you would either be laughing or sitting on the edge of your seat. Everything had you hooked from the opening action scene to the final line that is sure to put a smile on your face (I think I'll let you watch it as it is to good a line to spoil.) I agree some of the action scenes may of been a bit slapstick, but putting that aside it was still an excellent film.The storyline was also quite well done (or at least more creative than the ones from the 1940s) with a neat little twist in the second half of the film(I'll have to resist and stop myself from telling you what it is.) So ""HI-HO Silver and away!"" throw the critic reviews behind your saddles and get ready to race with The Lone Ranger, surely one of the best movies there is! 5/5 stars!

You got it; it should never have been made. IMDb.com says the cost was an estimated $250 million. I predict they will not make their money back, at least not in the US market. Do you remember Klinton Spilsbury, the lead in the 1981 The Legend of The Lone Ranger? IMDb shows this to be his first, last, and only movie (surely that's not possible, but certainly he has not had a splendid movie career). WellMr. Hammer should be worried.Why in the world did Verbinski and Bruckheimer believe that their Long Ranger should be a wimp? A comic buffoon? An anti-hero klutz? When did one of the great heroes of American western culture become appropriate for slapstick comedy? There are numerous funny lines, but with a sour aftertaste.Instead of a story line one can follow, this one is as straight as the cracked surface of a dried up desert lake bed. The writers' strategy (besides following the director and producer's orders) seems to be to throw everything into the script but the kitchen sink. A little of this, a lot of that, and stir like crazy. Over the top and under- satisfying.I wanted to leave before it was over. But you go, see for yourself.

For one Verbinski and Depp did an outstanding job with pirates of the Caribbean, except the fourth not my favorite one, and they did a great job on the Lone Ranger.

The story has everything from good humour(I found myself laughing out loud throughout), good story, interesting characters and great action.

471,hooliganstreetpictures,"The bland epic, The lone yet great and powerful oz ranger yawn",4,11 January 2014,"Let me put it this way. When you were young you liked macaroni that came from a box, now that you are older you prefer the real thing.To summarize up front, why was the Lone Ranger in this film such a pussy? This was not the Lone Ranger of Legend. This was the Long Ranger of lazy story plot convenience.Disney, could you give us a moment of sheer artistic creation and boldness instead of trying to please the masses while attempting to live up to your own over bloated legend? Sure you had a bang of an ending in the film, but hey money can buy anything, and quite frankly it should have bought a better script. Personally I found the ending like I found the whole film; trying to be to many different things.I myself am a humble film maker working off of nonexistent budgets and trying to do the best I can. When I see so many wonderful resources, people and budgets attached to this type of movie I expect something genius. If you can't give me something genius, then at least inspire me.From my perspective, and I apologize for being negative, but here's where it went wrong.1) The wrong actor played the Lone Ranger. Someone, say of a more heroic nature would have been a better choice. This, in part was probably due to the writers and whoever else decided it was a good idea to take the lazy way into writing a screenplay, by adding the horribly clichéd buddy relationship good cop/bad cop/straight lace guy vs wild crazy guy plot line...etc. After all, if it wasn't for the Lone Ranger's imbecilic pantywaist behavior there would have been no chemistry what-so-ever with the Tonto character... which was pretty much nonexistent anyway.Not to mention the ""my brother was a real hero, and I'm a pantywaist who has to strive for that mark"" story line.Couldn't they have tried something bold, couldn't the Lone Ranger be a kick ass dude? Someone to look up to? Instead of comic relief? 2) Johnny Depp, OK I know some people are sick of him but I still think he's alright, however maybe Disney could have done something real crazy... like cast a Native American? OK. Quick Google, apparently Depp says he has Native American blood. But... must Disney be so desperate to sell their films to the public? Why didn't they just ask Tom Hanks to play the part? Or Matt Damon? or maybe Denzel Washington? Or even Tyler Perry? Or get someone to make a Muppet Tonto? Depp's character, seemed to be there for nothing more than to babysit the lone ranger. Almost as if he was the candy that the studio dangled in front of the audiences to hopefully kick off a franchise. Sadly his acting reflected the same.Between this film and Oz the great and powerful, they both seemed to be epic-wannabes. They play the dramatic music in all the right places, they try and give us dramatic moments with characters that we (don't) really care about. They try and give us the small uplifting moments. They try and give us a moment of deep thought to ponder something bigger than ourselves. They try and give us a triumphant, yet very Disney approved ending...Did I mention they place all the correctly clichéd music at all the correctly clichéd moments? I think, to make a true epic you have to have bold genius. You have to make real macaroni, not the stuff from the box.",The Lone Ranger

Apparently two fraises that don't exist in the Hollywood summer movie dictionary. And with the likes of ""Man of steel,"" ""World War Z,"" and ""White house down"" Movies seem to be taking greater pleasure in waving a 200 + million dollar budget in our faces and screaming ""Look what we can do!"" And the Lone Ranger is no exception... To long by about 40 minutes, most of the films time is taken with two massive action sequences that, like Berry Peppers six shooters, just refuse to run out of ammo. Both taking place on run away trains (Perfect for a new theme ride at Disney Land.) Which, now that I think about, is probably the only reason this movie exists. because it sure wasn't to tell an engaging, original story with interesting characters. Johnny Depp as Tonto (That figures) is pretty much just doing what he knows how to do. play an off the wall character with crazy hair... Pretty much every single scene with Depp is played for laughs, and I can already hear the politically correct having a conniption over it. Armmie Hammer is... well, the Politically correct. A white guy who hates Violence and in turn hates guns, and in turn refuses to kill anyone, and even when he does decide to forgo that reasoning, the film wont allow him too. (Yawn) The movie hints at supernatural element,(Curse of the Black Pearl sort of thing)but never does anything with it. All in all it's a perfect case of what happens when a film has to much money for its own good, and a director who's trying way to hard to copy his previous successes. Bloated, Loud and annoying is what you get. And with this years ""pacific Rim,"" ""Wolverine,"" and ""R.i.p.d."" (AKA ""Men in Black"" rip off), still in the pipe, it doesn't look like we're in for a change any time soon.",The Lone Ranger
475,djaznh,Give This One A Chance,8,6 September 2014,"The best way to describe this film would be 'Tom & Jerry Go West With MontyPython'. There are some very funny moments, but make no mistake, you may want to have younger children give it a miss for violence. ""Silver's"" trainer deserves many kudos for the work with these horses. Johnny Depp, is well, Johnny Depp - a chameleon we can always recognize. Armie Hammer and William Fichtner are both excellent. If you haven't visited the locations used in this film, enjoy the scenery. It is a treat to see so much of the work performed on location. The first ten minutes will bring you in and the pace is pretty even from there. This production is campy and worth a matinée ticket, but happily, we watched at home and enjoyed this treat in comfort.",The Lone Ranger
476,emspamm,Whether this film made money or not it is still a great film,9,30 July 2013,"Watched this film twice and enjoyed every moment of it. It is well constructed throughout and if it was an engineering job would have been synonymous with the magical construction of the pyramids. As someone who can remember going to the cinema every week to see the shows that ended with cliff hangers I'd say this movie captures that feeling and the pace of the movie doesn't falter. The acting is excellent throughout especially between Tonto (Johnny Depp) and his sneered at ""kimo sabe"" (Lone Ranger, played by relative newcomer Armie Hammer), a much treasured running joke of many. I'll be keeping an eye out for Armie Hammer as although Depp had the best lines Armie more than holds his own.I found this movie to be a multi layered art of storytelling at its best as well as a tribute to the roots of movie making that goes back to Buster Keaton, especially in the later train scenes that are pure slapstick. Depp does old school where less is more, and a single raise of his eyebrow says so much more than a voluminous dialogue. He is at the height of his powers whether he is in the younger Tonto persona or as the older Tonto whose role is to provide the role of a guide to a young boy into the lost wonders of the past. The perspective of the young boy gives an innocence to the story telling that would be lost otherwise. I will cherish my copy of this movie as it is a deep river that I can swim in and enjoy again and again. If others have cold feet I'd look to their capacity and inability to look backwards and appreciate the richness of experience from which this film derives its inspiration. Detractors of this film have stated that it is a flop and marketing is a costly mess but that is a side issue if the product is quality and this movie is indeed quality.Watch, enjoy and laugh your socks off.",The Lone Ranger
477,lionkingluv303,it's cowboys of the caribbean,8,22 July 2013,"This movie was not nearly as bad as anyone has acted like it is. i actually really enjoyed it and found it intriguing. Johnny Depp did a fantastic job, as usual, and Armie Hammer was funny to watch.A lot of people say this movie is not a 'real western' and that it's got some racism in it. Let me just point out that it's Disney and you can't go without expecting that sort of thing.I will admit that it's basically 'Cowboys of the Caribbean', which is to say that it's the same movie but with cowboys and some minor differences. It's still a cool film though.Even with it's flaws, 'The Lone Ranger' is no where near as bad as anyone has said. It's well-made and well-acted. I really liked it, 8/10/.",The Lone Ranger
478,capmoonbeams,Don't Listen to the Critics!,10,2 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger presents a new take on the classic characters the Lone Ranger and Tonto. This film is exactly what a summer movie should be and one fun ride that you most defitenly don't want to miss.The plot is as follows: An American Indian spirit warrior, Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice. The two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption This film is from the team that brought us Pirates of the Caribbean that includes director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, and composer Hans Zimmer.The film stars Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto, these two have great chemistry that really shows, The Lone Ranger also stars Helena Bonham Carter, William Fichtner, and Tom Wilkinson.The Lone Ranger rides strong for several reasons that include direction, cinematography, casting, screenplay, special effects, pacing, acting, and story. Due to these reasons the Lone Ranger can gain a new younger fan base while still appealing to older fans or casual moviegoers.The bottom line is watch this movie and enjoy its incredible action and comedy that will surly rope you in.... And watch out for some throwbacks to the classic show. 10/10: Hi-Ho Silver!",The Lone Ranger
479,plasencio-ll,Woody (Lone Ranger) destroys Buzz (Man of Steel),9,8 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger is how hero movies are to be made. Fun action without taking itself so seriously. Depp haters can hate for the most asinine of reasons, but the man has acting chops compared to has-been rappers turned actor (cough, Marky Mark). Unlike Man of Steel, Ranger was able to deliver classic nostalgia to older fans as well as introducing subtle new twists to familiar ""Ranger"" devices such as the silver bullet. Box office numbers do not make a movie great. And soul surfers do not need trophies to validate their surfing greatness. Armie Hammer was a great surprise in making the character his own. It was not forced and the transformation can literally be seen as the movie progresses. A great family film.",The Lone Ranger
480,WellCooked,Funny,7,9 August 2013,"I've seen that with this movie, lot's of people just don't agree. But I really enjoyed the movie, and it made sense to me as a 13 year old, and 40 year old people don't make no sense about this movie. Anyways, let's get to the point...I found it really funny, which kind of made up for the 'confusing' plot. At the end of the movie, it all came and fit together well, so definitely a second do over of watching the movie would help for those that find the movie confusing.I really liked in this movie how things that the people do were so unrealistic... actually let's say so perfect as in the first time someone shot something, it was a bang-on, bulls-eye hit. Another thing I've heard people complain about is that this movie is racial? Well, let's see about this...The movie is based on an aboriginal guy, and an American guy who worked together to complete what they wanted to complete. Perhaps that one moment whenever the aboriginal was prancing about with the feathers and chanting an aboriginal song could be considered racist, but other than that, nothing.Interesting movie, I hope you watch it. Enjoy the movie ;)-WellCooked",The Lone Ranger
481,buttkick,Tonto is no longer the sidekick,7,21 July 2013,"Didn't have much expectations to this movie. I always found the Lone Ranger comics, rather boring. My son wanted to see it, so we went. It was clear from the beginning that Tonto was stealing the show, and Lone Ranger had taken over as a sidekick. It was very funny, Depp had lots of charakter it that special way that only he can master. The story was good, and the movie didn't have a dull second. A good old fashion movie, where the good guys and the bad guys are obvious from the start. For you who haven't seen it yet, then i can say its all about a dead bird, a crazy horse and bunnies gone wild. And then of course a lone Indian chasing revenge on a demon ghost called wendigo.",The Lone Ranger
482,stevepat100,Hollywood Destroys Another Cinema Icon,1,22 July 2013,"Reasons to vote thumbs up for this film: (1) You are in the age group that knows nothing about the LR icon, story and/or cinema-TV history (2) You like a mindless drivel script the kind of script that has the lone ranger pulled by a rope along the ground with his bare head dragged through horse s- - t. (3) You are related to the movie (4) You have a skewed cinema value system (5) You enjoy seeing the LR slam Tonto in the head with a heavy metal shovel and then ride off and leave him (to die???)and this after Tonto saved his life (I did say senseless) (6) Script writers have the LR tell us he believes the saloon prostitutes are all 'dancers' (7) You are forced to watch scene after scene with a kid and come-to- life museum exhibit Tonto that has nothing to do with the story except to interrupt it (8) See the LR make a mocking joke about his brothers death as he says in joking fashion "" I guess I'm the wrong brother"". Okay you get the picture. I did like the train wreck scenes since they truly represented the film which itself was a major train wreck. Very often when you see multiple screen writers, in this case THREE, you know a cinema train wreck may be heading your way. Horse Silver was mocked, the endearing term Hi Oh Silver was mocked, the LR is portrayed as a brainless air head, the LR was so emotionless he shed not a tear when he watches, from inches away, as his brother was butchered in a much worse fashion then an effort by Dexter. A love interest was created and followed for hours even though we all know the LRs only real 'love' interest is his horse Silver.Johnny Depp has a strange sense of humor which often works. His close efforts and involvement in making this movie destroyed every premise of this cinema icon. Since Depp played Tonto as an emotional cripple that may explain what we are forced to view. Wow, watching the LR accuse Tonto of being complicate in the deaths of 100's of his tribe's men, women and kids when Tonto was shown as nothing worse then an innocent 10-12 year old was again nonsensical.So long as some like nonsense (hey look at the Adam Sandler following) and have no 'feel' for the LR icon and history you will see many thumbs up. That does not turn a awful piece of cinema garbage into a deserving presentation.Pros: Some awful nice scenery and special affects.",The Lone Ranger
483,vagg-agor,Hi Ho Silver!!!!,10,29 July 2013,"From producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski, the filmmaking team behind the blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, comes Disney/ Jerry Bruckheimer Films' ""The Lone Ranger,"" a thrilling adventure infused with action and humor, in which the famed masked hero is brought to life through new eyes. Native American spirit warrior Tonto (Johnny Depp) recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid (Armie Hammer), a man of the law, into a legend of justice- taking the audience on a runaway train of epic surprises and humorous friction as the two unlikely heroes must learn to work together and fight against greed and corruption.

484,HideousHades-753-960378,"The Director's Indecision, Among Many Other Things, was The Lone Ranger's Downfall",3,1 August 2013,"Is it an action comedy? Is it a drama? Is it a film about redemption and justice, cooperation and equality? Gore Verbinski and Jerry Buckenheimer obviously weren't sure, because if they had been, watching the film wouldn't have felt like riding an untamed horse. The plot development was equally tumultuous - Tonto (Johnny Depp) constantly switched from comic to severe, and the Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer) exercised both a weak and robust personality. To make matters worse, the directors attempted to shove in a lame romance subplot at the last moment. Unfortunately, that's not where it ends. Perhaps, if there were some redeeming factors in this film, the director's indecision could have been overlooked - however, this is not the case. The writing was atrocious, resulting in lines such as ""wrong brother"", when a widow (Ruth Wilson) chooses to kiss the brother of his deceased husband. Many scenes were completely unnecessary, and only added to the already long run time. The villain (William Fichtner) was uninteresting and predictable, while the Lone Ranger played the part of a sincere and mysterious man poorly. Even though Johnny Depp played his role as Tonto well, his sudden personality switches made him seem ridiculous. The music was so bland that when the original theme tune (William Tell Overture) came on at the end of the film, I was downright shocked. In conclusion, The Lone Ranger was terrible in almost all respects. However, it's a film that some might enjoy, if they can find a way to overlook the long run time, lame writing, horrendous plot development, and mediocre acting. You've been warned. -Neo Stark",The Lone Ranger
485,evxsilvx,Good enough,5,11 August 2013,"In my opinion, it's a good movie. Not an epic movie. Just a nice movie. It has that humor, like on PotC and it's one of those movies that everybody should like 'cause it's a bit of everything: adventure/action, humor, drama etc. I'm kinda disappointed with the critics and that, because I saw it and it wasn't boring at all. The problem is that as the 1st PotC was a big success, Jerry Bruckheimer kept the kind of humor, which is now getting a bit old. That's why most people think it's boring. I only went to see it because Depp was in it. And I see everything he's in. And if anyone says that he is the one who is making the movie have such bad reviews, then that person is wrong. If it wasn't for him, no one would see the movie. But then again, the movie was..... I don't know, but it was as if I had already seen it. So, I would probably give it 7 or 7.2 or something like that.",The Lone Ranger
486,ashleighbrown15,"Simply amazing, absolutely hilarious, another Johnny Depp classic.",7,18 August 2013,"The lone ranger was so much better than expected. Having not seen or heard much about it apart from terrible reviews, I left the cinema gob smacked. It was brilliant and included my favourite actors; Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. It was hilarious! Everyone sat in the cinema was laughing at one point. Johnny played his character brilliantly and the quirkiness of Johnny himself helped give the film something for both adults and children to enjoy. The characters individually stood out like silver in a river. One of the best movie's I've seen all summer! Would highly recommend and would love to see it again. The critics reviews are defiantly misleading, it's better to watch and review yourself. Great action, adventure story, with many twists.",The Lone Ranger
487,funkykitten_007,I really wanted to like it...,3,30 August 2013,"*spoilers ahead* So I read a review a while back which wasn't complimentary about the film at all, and when I had an opportunity to see it for myself I thought it couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviewer had made out. After all, the cast looked impressive and Depp, well, except for his most recent films I usually find Depp quite watchable.I wanted to like it, I really did. However the first clue was that, after 3 weeks of release in the UK, I had to search real hard for a local showing. The second was that the auditorium was at best only a quarter full, and barely made a sound all night. The film started so sloooowly (in fact I don't think it ever picked up), and it's all surprising violent for a Disney. Yet I was so unengaged I had plenty of time to notice everything that made no sense at all. Yes I know it's a fantasy, but when you're sitting there thinking ""so the bad guys just happen to run out of ammo long enough to give the brothers a touching goodbye"", rather than actually *feeling* that touching goodbye, there's something very wrong. And for me it just never got any better.John Reid (who later becomes the Lone Ranger) seriously needed to man up. The amount of times he pulled a gun and then refused to use it! I wanted him to just pull the trigger already, but no, he always looks like just the thought of shooting that mass-murdering cannibal will make him cry. Seems like the Lone Ranger is taking his time to grow a pair. While Red (played by an under-used Bonham-Carter) had no qualms about shooting those who deserved it through her wooden leg, which was possibly the most creative idea in the whole movie. Red would make a much better LR.And Tonto... Jack Sparrow in war paint? Unfortunately, yes I think he was, only a very tired-looking Sparrow with fewer clever or funny lines to say (some scenes were straight out of Pirates but executed with less swagger). Mugging at the camera just didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure why he was inexplicably made into a Comanche, but for all the Comanche reputation there was just no fight in him. The inclusion of the 1933 boy's snack wrapper as a trade item in 1869 in his storytelling also called everything Tonto related into question anyway, which made me wonder what the whole point was. If this movie was a drawn-out, poorly-told introduction so that the sequels can get straight on with the good stuff, I think throwing more money at this franchise would be a mistake.The story itself wasn't gripping enough, the script wasn't clever or funny enough (I think I came close to laughing twice), there was no character that I wanted to get behind, and there was far too much that the audience had to infer. For a 2.5hr film, they certainly left a lot unexplained (e.g. Red's leg, how they knew about the nitro, how Red was involved in the finale plan etc). The finale was dragged out to a loop of the tune William Tell which I gather was meant to rouse excitement, but fell horribly flat because, like the rest of it, it all just took so long (other than the deaths of the bad guys of course, which happened in a flash and were hardly satisfying). Plus, Reid is too much of a wimp to come across as the smart, tough hero at this point. Zorro definitely has nothing to worry about.Some people walked out before the end, and I wanted those three hours of my life back. It just wasn't good. The only good thing about it was Silver the spirit-horse. So I give this movie 3*, two for Silver and 0.5 each for the two times this movie nearly got a smile.",The Lone Ranger
488,aravindia75,A fun movie with a few flaws!,6,19 October 2013,"I didn't watch this movie when it came out in theatre as it flopped big time and got removed from many theatres faster than one could react! I caught up with it on cable TV where they broadcast it on pay per view! I admit I was too bored and just decided to watch it to while of time plus there was the curiosity value for me as I wanted to find out why this movie flopped big time! As I watched it I was in for a pleasant surprise! The movie was quite good and not at all boring! It had almost all of the right ingredients needed for a blockbuster and so I wonder why did this flop? Could it be that Americans are shown to be in bad light while Native Americans are shown as good guys? Or the fact that in the Lone ranger series Tonto's character was just a sidekick to the Lone Ranger but in this he is given equal or in some situations more importance than the ranger himself? or due to disgusting looking make up effects such as the villain's upper lip missing or the white dry pasty make up on Tonto or the overall dirty appearance of many characters or the fast paced but highly unbelievable train chase in the end? or the supernatural element such as the ranger coming back from the dead or unbelievable near miss situations? or is it just that people have already seen 100s of similar blockbuster movies that they have had enough of it? whatever be it I liked it and wish inspite of its flaws (the supernatural stuff, unbelievable climax) this movie should have at least had a decent run at the box office instead of flopping big time! By the way the best part went to that guy who played the ranger's brother! He appears for a very short while and gets killed by the villain but his part was very moving and wish he got more screen time! And wish tonto's character was played by a lesser known actor than a superstar like Depp who sadly has done way too many roles like this (one could say its an extension of his character from Pirates) Depp's superstar persona overtook tonto's character and he overshadows the movies main lead in many segments!",The Lone Ranger
489,matthewdocmeyer,Bad story bad concept,1,7 April 2019,"Things that are wrong with: The Lone Ranger.
1. Factitious town of Colby, TX. There are 1208 cities in Texas, pick one. This doesn't even touch on the countless communities there are around Texas.
2. Scenery and backdrop are not in Texas. This error is atrocious and perpetuates the stereotype of Texas being a big dessert.
3. Johnny Depp is not Comanche. The Comanche lived in this area along with other Native Americans.
4. If you wanted the story to be about a silver mine then use the Los Almages mine (San Saba mine)
The search for this lost mine goes all the way back to Jim Bowie looking for it. Or tell the story of the lost gold wagon in Mills county. San Saba and Mills county still have the jail from the 1800's. The courthouse in Mills County was burned down around this time.
5. If this is the San Saba area of Texas then you use an outlaw from the area Black Jack Ketchum.
6. It is painfully obvious that a non-Texan wrote this story by punching in a bunch of scenarios that work in some formula to produce a good movie. It's really bad.

While I know it had some incorrect historical moments (as mentioned on this site itself), I found the movie to be a fun, action packed ride. I was not bored, nor did I fall asleep during a single minute.The only part I could have done without is the entire aspect of older Tonto telling the story to the kid. That could have been totally taken out and the movie would have been fine. The cutting back and fourth between the past and present annoyed me and took away from the film.Maybe if if had been released at a different time it would have done better.",The Lone Ranger

The previews showed off some of its spectacular special effects and with Johnny Depp as Tonto, what's not to like? This movie was a little long and I probably would've had more fun with it if the Lone Ranger sprang into action sooner; however, Depp's Tonto is comparable to his Captain Jack Sparrow. Even Silver, the horse, was a brilliant, quirky addition to the movie. Helena Bonham Carter made an awesome madam, which was handled with tasteful discretion. Armie Hammer's John Reid showed some good character growth. The costumes looked authentic to the period and a hint of the link to Green Hornet was there too.

An hour in everyone and I have a good sample audience my wife, teenage daughter and 10 year old daughter all reached for their iPods to browse the net. And I wasn't that far behind them. The jokes were typical and you could see them coming miles off. I think Johnny Depp is cool, but they tried to make jack sparrow as an Indian. I'm glad his next movie is absolutely different.

This is a very entertaining film with plenty of action and laughs. OK, so it bombed in The States - probably because the panning it took from the critics persuaded the American audiences to stay away.However, if you want almost three hours of fun, adventure and general mayhem, and you're willing to enter into the spirit of the adventure, I would thoroughly recommend this film.Being of a certain age and, therefore, having seen the original TV series all those years ago, some of the ""one-liners"" are better appreciated.

495,frederic-raspe,Perfect popcorn entertainment,9,9 January 2014,"There is nothing to complain about this movie. It's a Disney movie of a comic franchise and as that it works perfectly. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp are great casts, as well as the villains. The idea to let the story be told by old Tonto to a boy who visits a fair is neat and works great. Good jokes, an awesomely weird horse, a Tonto that makes you laugh and cry, a Lone Ranger growing into his role as outlaw-hero and some great action sequences that are believable in the universe of a comic movie. Fichtner is awesome as a cannibalistic head of a gang of outlaws and the story develops just fine with some nice twists. There's not much you can do wrong watching that film. If you have the option to watch it in 3D i suggest to do so, but it also works fine in 2D. I honestly enjoyed every minute of it, watching it with my girlfriend.

Sometimes there is just zero explanation for why a movie doesn't do well in the box office.
On a budget of $215 million, it grossed $89 domestically but went on to globally do $260 million. Now I'm not certain if advertising is factored into that but at least it seems like it broke even and then some when factoring in dvd, blu ray, digital, streaming, etc.But I digress, the movie is extremely entertaining and I gladly watch it again every few years.

497,amb0120,Too Bad,3,7 August 2013,"This one is a puzzle: with screen writing treatments by Terry Rossio, Ted Elloitt and Justin Haythe it would be almost a given for success, based on their track records, but the script comes off uneven and just does not satisfy. The director, Gore Verbinski, is also at fault. He seems not to understand the genre. The museum scenes just don't work for me at all and are out of place. The acting itself is good, but far from great. The Lone Ranger comes off a bit of a buffoon, while Tonto can't seem to make up his mind as to whether he's a comedian or philosopher. Just because something is funny does not mean it works for a story, but no one seems to understand this in this production. Carving out new ground in any genre, and especially a Western, is not easy. To accomplish this, one must have a clear vision of what needs to be done. The idea of telling the story of the Lone Ranger from Tonto's point of view is, in itself, fine, but Tonto doesn't seems lost. If, what I've read, Depp wanted to portray Tonto as an equal to the Lone ranger, as much as I like him, he failed. Too bad this crew didn't take at least a few clues from the folks who did Tombstone, which lacked depth, but was an entertaining retelling of Wyatt Earp. Film is a collective effort, so there is no one person who should receive the accolade or blame. But, maybe Disney should just stick to animated kids films and movies that appeal to ten year-old audiences .",The Lone Ranger

It was a pleasure for me to see this new movie version and to remember the character of my childhood.Depp plays a very intelligent, witty and intuitive ""Tonto"" (aka ""Toro"" in Spanish) and won by far the full movie.The plot combines the classic elements of an Indiana Jones movie with a touch of Shakespeare on a very well written plot that favors humor over drama and fun over and excessive analysis, though will result a bit long for some people. The film serves as an introduction to the characters, their complexes, their traumas and motives.Maybe not many Americans will like this new candid approach where more whites are more evil and mean than the Comanche Indians themselves. I think the Cavendish character is very very mean but a little naive sometimes.Important elements of the American West History are present, being probably one of the main characters the railroad by itself. Spectacular scenarios and other situations and very original views and some that we have never seen before that would likely make of the Lone Ranger 2013 a modern classic.

My family (9yr old son, 25 yr old son, im 45 and hubby is 55) saw it knowing the critics hate for this movie so maybe it helped to have such low expectations but regardless it was very entertaining. You have to be OK with depp's similar quirky shtick (as seen in pirates, alice in wonderland, Willy wonka, etc). we found depp very funny and his banter with hammer was laugh out loud funny at times (great comedic timing for both characters). yes it has its share of violence so maybe its not for younger ones. it was worth the ticket price and that is always a good thing.. take it for what it is ...just a movie and enjoy the ride. not many westerns appeal to me but this retro remake was a great surprise. SEE IT FOR YOURSELF!",The Lone Ranger
500,maria-virokhovsky,Too bloody,6,7 July 2013,"Violence and gore in this movie has really ruined it for me. Shame, really, as the story line is quite interesting, most of the scenery is beautiful (line of cool cowboys riding into the plains, fantastic!!!), and the main characters totally charming. Johnny does it again as Tonto, very funny yet a man with a painful past and anguish, that you relate to very much. Handsome Armie is great, too. The problem is with the subject matter. I'm not sure a PG13 movie should contain scenes of cutting out a heart of still living man. Equally disturbing is the fate of the Indians in this movie, and even though I know it is the truth. Still, not good for a movie which is supposed to be summer entertainment. I loved Rango much more.",The Lone Ranger
501,Mike4920,Hi Ho Silver - back to days of my childhood,10,26 December 2015,"Years ago I would go to a theater - and leave some coins at the ticket window - along with my sense of reality. I would then escape the world - and enjoy another reality. This movie takes me back to those days. I loved the movie.I think that Depp/Tonto 'owned' the movie for the first two hours - with the Lone Ranger being drug along in various stages of willingness. Furthermore - Tonto had all of the good lines.At about 23 minutes from the end of the movie, Tonto gets out of the driver's seat - to make room for ""The Lone Ranger"". Minimal dialog, lots of action, chases, pithy one liners and a great sense of joy and satisfaction all occur in a short 20 minute window.For me - one of the great movies of the past several years.Yes, historical inaccuracies abound, and the guns often seem to never run out of bullets, laws of physics are suspended and silliness prevails. BUT - remember you were supposed to leave 'reality' at the box office - before you entered the theater.",The Lone Ranger
502,anderson356145,I liked it even better the second time I watched it!,8,24 January 2014,"I received a blu-ray of Lone Ranger for Christmas....and watched it again last night. I believe I enjoyed it even more this time because I caught on to other things and got ""inside"" jokes I didn't catch when I saw it in the theater. I stand by my original opinions: 1. this movie got hammered by the critics unnecessarily, and 2. the actors chosen for the parts were a great fit, and 3. the music and action was spectacular. 4. the movie kept my attention and it was not too long. Although I totally disagree with reviewers who said that Johnny Depp was ""channeling Jack Sparrow"" in this film, I do have to admit that there were some other amusing parallels between Pirates of the Caribbean and the Lone Ranger movies. Unfortunately, people just can't seem to separate Depp the actor from Sparrow the character, and he ends up being pigeon-holed into that role. (If you've never seen or been a fan of any of the POC movies you would never even notice any of the similarities in the Lone Ranger.) Armie Hammer makes such a great transformation from the straight laced, book-smart ""do it by the book and justice will prevail"", naive John Reid into the Lone Ranger. He undergoes this transformation with the help & guidance from the much wiser, wise-cracking, street-smart and damaged Tonto. The movie is alternately funny and heart-wrenching - because we all know the reality of how native Americans were treated. As for reviewers who comment on the ""unrealistic"" nature of the action scenes: don't you believe it! They were great. When was the Lone Ranger series ever supposed to be ""realistic"" anyway? It always dealt with ""spirit walkers"" and ""spirit horses"" - the Lone Ranger and Silver could do things no other man or horse could do. Anyway - give the movie a chance. It is intense at times - that was the unfortunate way of life during those times; but there are lots of laughs along the way too. Beautiful scenery. Stay tuned past the first set of short end credits - there is something left to see.",The Lone Ranger

He shape shifts into a Comanche, the straw hat transforms into a dead crow prop, and the cane becomes distributed bird seed. Tonto has moments of facial expressions communicating. ""Why am I in this film?"" There are detailed magnificent sets of the wild west like Heaven's Gate. There is even a stand-in for Chief Dan George of Little Big Man. The casting for the Lone Ranger is a miscue. Who is Armie Hammer? The chemistry between the two does not work for me. I would prefer a screen veteran.

Carter (stunning as usual). Some will argue that the character of Tonto is in many ways like Jack Sparrow's from PotC, probably thanks to Johnny. Surely, but it is important to realize that this is not the story about pirates, but about Indians and Tonto's character is very funny and was played very well! Personally i think the character is very likable among many others that occur in the film.There are many action scenes in the film (on the trains mainly), I think this is an advantage and gives the movie a great rhythm and speed, wasn't bored a single moment!Yeah, there are many effects, but why complain when the outcome is entertaining movie. Scenery is nice, tricks are cool :) The question of violence is really not in place for a western movie.The last aspect that gives this film a power is the music. Just two words for this one= Hans Zimmer.The movie is fun, writing is great, directing on high level.Yep, i loved this movie, SO GO AND WATCH IT!!! :D",The Lone Ranger
506,sylogician,"Good film, mixed tone, too violent for young demo",6,7 July 2013,"As an adult I enjoyed the film. But it was way too violent for the Disney brand (and a PG-13). It must have barely squeaked out of R territory by a very narrow margin.I agree with other posters that the tone was uneven. One minute there's a huge slaughter with a Gatling Gun, the next there's a horse in a tree that's played for a laugh. It was sort of like watching Mad Max through the prism of Pirates.As for performances: Johnny Depp as an Indian was not as insulting as people are prejudging, but I think the role should have gone to a Native American actor which would have really brought home the connection to the native people's plight.Armie Hammer was fine as the square jawed hero. William Fichtner was great as the bad guy. Ruth Wilson was meh both in performance and as the love interest. James Dale comes across as leading man material as the big brother.I was disappointed by the cinematography. The colors were washed out and the scope was less than epic. I know that colorless palette is a JB signature look, but those beautiful vistas deserved COLOR. Blue skies and Red buttes. Bojan Bazelli should have fought for it in the color timing.Overall a good flick. I'm sorry to see it not doing well. I think there's a place for Western's among today's audiences, and it'll be too easy to say it failed because it was a Western, relegating the genre back to oblivion.",The Lone Ranger
507,katheliz,"Enjoy the whole experience, sight and sound",9,21 December 2013,"I saw this with another old lady, and we were enthralled. The acting was great. The story was adult, not simplistic. I thought the violence was too much for children, as it was pretty graphic. But this isn't a movie for the kiddies. Don't be fooled by the occasional appearance of ten-year-old boys. Wonderful one-liners from Johnny Depp. But for me, the made-for-the-movie arrangement of The William Tell Overture when the Lone Ranger finally appears in character was awesome. Wow. I pre ordered the DVD on the basis of the music. The original story of The Lone Ranger is followed here - ten Rangers were ambushed and left for dead, but one survived and was cared for by the Indian who found him - Tonto. Will there be a sequel to this movie? I think not. We all know what comes next; there are adventures on TV and film and in comic strips that we've all seen. But this movie contains within itself the rest of the story.",The Lone Ranger
508,lndultsch,"Unjustly bashed by ""professional"" critics",9,12 December 2013,"Disney, check. Bruckheimer, check. Verbinsky, check. Depp as the deadpan, comic sidedick who really is the main protagonist in spite of appearances, check. So this is just a rehash of the Pirates of the Caribbean recipe, right? Maybe. At least it's what kept me from watching The Lone Ranger in theatres when it released. That and the terrible reviews. 31% on Rotten Tomatoes, what? The Lone Ranger is a hugely entertaining ride, full of fun, over-the-top, yet thrillingly directed action. The comedy often comes out of nowhere, always hits the mark. And rather than bash on Johnny Depp for recycling his Jack Sparrow performance, I'd rather salute his sense of comedic pacing and talent for deadpan, hilarious characters. The art direction is absolutely commendable, here, bringing out the beauty of the Wild West in ways that bring back to the best Western flicks of history. The sparse use of CGI, especially when it comes stunts is a refreshing change. And the overall pace of the movie is never to the detriment of the story (which is rather simple, but hell, this is The Lone Ranger, not Once Upon a Time in the West.) It's just that the movie doesn't pause to tell you the story, like it's too often the case in Summer blockbusters that take itself too seriously. Instead, they chose to tell the story through the action, giving, in that sense, more substance to the action sequences that aren't just there to be sandwiched between bits of exposition. In that spirit, the climactic sequence is truly a feat, juxtaposing layers of dramatic stakes, often in the same screen, crossing and colliding with each other at an insane (yet very readable) pace, that reminded me the best moments of the Back to the Future trilogy. And they even managed to sprinkle hilarious comedy on top. So if you're in search of a great adventure movie that allows you to put your brains to some rest for a couple hours but doesn't treat you like an idiot. If you value quality entertainment over what's currently hyped in Hollywood movies, do yourself a favor and rent this flick. You're bound to have a jolly good time. I give it a 9 out of 10, just to counter-balance the bad hype and the undeservingly low score. Hi-ho Silv... Oh okay, I won't do that.",The Lone Ranger

510,voaidesciprian95,"""It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes.""",9,24 August 2013,"Tim Burton's (""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure""/""Beetlejuice""/""Batman"") sweet but bizarre fable is a fantasy comedy updated take on the Frankenstein story. It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes. The main thrust of the fable is exposing the exotic gentle freak to the boring middle-class suburbs and seeing how they relate to each other, with the monster being the sympathetic innocent and society being the one to fear because of its evil nature. It's taken from a story by Burton and Caroline Thompson. The fantasy tale is set circa 1960.Edward (Johnny Depp) is the man-made creation of an elderly genius inventor (Vincent Price) who died before finishing his would-be companion and left him with large pruning scissors for hands. Spending many lonely years in a vast musty Gothic castle that sits on a hill atop a suburban town, Edward is visited by an overly upbeat Avon lady, Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest), desperate for business thereby taking an alternate route. She feels sorry for the well-behaved, lonely and freakish looking lad (adorned with an electric-shock hairdo and a black leather outfit, and an appearance that is a cross between Michael Jackson and a punk rocker), and takes him home to her 'normal' suburban family that consists of her wry humored husband Bill (Alan Arkin), pretty high school cheerleader daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) and son Kevin (Robert Oliveri). The bourgeois neighbors live in a tidy neighborhood that features assorted pastel-colored tract houses, and all act as stereotypical suburban families with gossiping housewives and dull bread-winners. There's also a fanatical religious nut (O-Lan Jones) and an oversexed lady (Kathy Baker) doing their thing in the 'burbs. Edward's unique scissors allows him to become an instant neighborhood celebrity when they see he's harmless and can carve exotic lawn hedges and do neat hair designs for their pet dogs. The socially stunted teenager quietly falls for Peg's pretty daughter Kim, but she finds him at first monstrous and prefers her insensitive bully boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). One night Jim tricks the guileless Edward into helping him rob his parents' house. When the cops arrive, he abandons him. Suddenly the once popular Edward is viewed as an outcast and a freak by all his former fickle friends, as they all abandon him except for the nurturing Peg and her kind husband Bill. Kim ends up having a special feeling for him, but never sees him again after taking him back to his castle for safety.The heartfelt fable is framed around a bedtime story that Kim, now a grandma, tells her grandson. It ends up being a melancholy tale that critiques human nature and conformity; but it's much more hopeful of society than the Frankenstein story, as this time the town might ban together to go after the alien but they are dispersed through deception by Kim before they can act like a lynch mob. Maybe the lesson here is that if one wants to be different or creative (like a Hollywood filmmaker), being cunning is a necessary ingredient for success.",The Lone Ranger
511,cogollo1974-612-157173,"Very nice adventure film, not a western",9,12 August 2013,"I consider The Lone Ranger a great entertaining film. The movie is a whooping 2,5 hours long and I watched it from 23:30 to 2am, but nevertheless it kept me awake the whole time.I loved the visuals and landscapes (I've always loved westerns, specially because of the sceneries and this movie's landscapes are truly amazing!).The action scenes are very entertaining and have a well built pace. Towards the end there's an amazing 15-20 minutes long action scene, but as it consists of 3 different sections it really flows wonderfully and is very interesting.The acting I found powerful and quite good. I specially liked Johnny Depp. Yes, he is playing another weird-type character, but I found his performance quite different from that in Pirates of the Caribbean. I also loved the moments in the film where he appears, as they are sometimes slow but sensitive and a good pace change in the movie.Finally, the movie is not a western, but more an adventure type film (à la Pirates of the Caribbean or Indiana Jones) so avoid it if you don't like those kind of movies. Well, maybe there's a scene towards the beginning of the movie that has more of a western feel to it.I would give it a 9 out of 10 if you like adventure movies. If you are waiting for a rugged western and tough western themes you will be disappointed so don't watch it.",The Lone Ranger

Great action (real Stunts and little/none of the usual CGI crap we are fed by movies nowadays), decent comedy, good acting performances.The movie is maybe, just trying a little too hard at times. But thats no reason to complain and hate on it so much. The real reason imo is that there's social criticism which is probably very uncomfortable for the average American movie goer. ""The American Dream is built on blood and tears. The law, crime, and business work hand in glove."" The same theme was present in TPOC series but i guess as long as it was the corrupt Brits in Pirates this was amusing, but Lone Ranger with its corrupt Americans strikes too close to home. Funnily enough the story of Lone Ranger has more fact in it than the one in TPOC. But as i said, the American public is probably very sensitive of the history of how America came to be.For the unbiased movie goer, this is a good entertaining film. 8/10",The Lone Ranger

It is an absolute blast from start to finish. Johnny Depp nails the character of Tonto and Armie Hammer portrays the 'Lone Ranger' brilliantly. The films characters occasionally had me laughing out loud in the cinema but not to the point that I lost interest in the story, which also is engaging and interesting. One problem that I did encounter with the film was that we are constantly taken to a older Tonto telling the story to a young boy. I kept forgetting that this was happening and it bugged me that the main story was interrupted every now and again.

I really love Gore Verbinski and his style---particularly how wonderful Johnny Depp and Gore make as a team. He's a very visionary storyteller and is one of the best, in my opinion. The Lone Ranger is incredibly hilarious and I laughed through the whole thing. It was able to deliver the comedy, the action, and was able to bring up some serious issues regarding the unfair treatment of the Native Americans without being a drag. The 2 and a half hours felt like nothing and went by very quickly because the editing and pacing allowed it to. There was definitely some Pirates of the Caribbean elements, but that made it all the better. Truly a FUN movie. I would watch it again and again, and am going to buy the DVD. The ONLY thing I'd change is it's total lack of female characters, despite Ruth Wilsons one or two lines that didn't contribute much to the plot. In fact, I think I counted like 3 females total.Oh yeah, and the soundtrack was amazing. I was literally out of my seat with a giant grin on my face during the climax scene while *that music* was playing----you'll know what I'm talking about after you watch the movie.",The Lone Ranger
515,ClaytonRCRyan,"Frustratingly Stupid, Cliché, and Disappointing",1,7 July 2013,"Where to start. I am a 17 and therefore have no right to compare this to the old Lone Ranger radio and TV show. However, I have enough knowledge to gather that this was an utter failure of a movie when compared. From the beginning, I was certainly intrigued. The framed storyline told by the leathery-skinned, and broken English-speaking Tonto seemed like a great way to introduce the story. Soon, after John's brother dies, my attention span derailed, much like the steam engine in the beginning. The tone seemed like it would be serious. And the director's couldn't decide if it would be.There were many intense, almost dark scenes that could have made a great film about scandal and morality, and the soundtrack did its job highlighting important moments. The betrayal of Tonto to his people, the heart eating brutality by Cavendish, the corrupt greed of the railroad, and the horrifying conflict between ""Civilization"" and the Indians (including a devastating massacre by Gatling gun), all could have made a fantastic film with the same dramatic caliber as ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,"" but instead found themselves among ill-placed jokes, a painfully cowardly ""hero,"" and so much CGI, that I found myself trying to find what was actually real scenery. An hour could have been cut from this as well, between a useless hint of a love interest between the ""hero"" and his sister-in-law, the captivity of the main actress (whose escape is never explained), and dry, uninteresting humor that ruins any form of being a serious storyline. Did we really have to see CGI cannibalistic rabbits, or Depp and Hammer buried long enough to joke and be licked by a horse? And even in its length, the Lone Ranger still doesn't become the legendary hero, or anything more than a over-honored weakling who shows up just in time to save the day. I do admit, the classic train chase at the end did take on that feeling of a Wild West show, but could have used a healthy dose of realism to make it not so outlandish.The Lone Ranger was a disastrous flop, full of pointless scenes and plot changes, weak and stereotyped leading characters, and a despairing glimpse of what could have been a fantastic film. With its storyline balancing tediously between a ""Rescue/Revenge"" flick and a ""Moral Justice"" drama, the script could not have possibly fulfilled both ideas to match the status of the legendary hero.",The Lone Ranger

It is but the characters are barely fleshed out and when you come to understand one facet of their personality as a viewer, another three come hurling out at you throughout the whole movie. You can never grasp any one character. It feels hazardous. This is what bothered me most. This movie has a serious identity crisis. The message changed every hour and I still don't quite understand what I was meant to leave with. On top of all of this, the acting was all over the place. Characters shifted in their intent and intensity too often and without care. Sorry folks, Johnny Depp was really playing Jack Sparrow dressed up as a Native American. Actually, I found it completely messed up that they hired a white man from Kentucky to play Tonto. He was out of place. It is fun for a rainy afternoon but definitely not worth admission. I felt like I was watching an old western vignette on a projector that was about to explode in the middle of a dust storm.

Not only does he not resemble a Native American, he didn't have the persona of the original Tonto.

While its starting serious, relatively brutal (sniper in the canon), it ends up Disney like - no one gets really hurt by someone, like shooting guns out of hands and nonsense super stunts like riding on a horse on top of a fast driving train without loosing your hat.worst thing about the action sequence was that they where simply to long, the big final got boring after a few minutes of endless super stunts sequences.at the end - the bad boys where allowed to murder pretty brutal while the good guys never really killed anyone.Also as i said in the beginning everything within the Story was pointless. You could leave out the hole lone Ranger Story and the end Result would have been the same (Indians get murdered and the Railroad wins).Also most of the Parts didn't make any real sense and the connections between the scenes seems sometimes lost.The biggest Joke of the hole Movie was Jonny Depp after wards blaming critics for the big losses the Movie produced.There is no one to blame but people who rate this Movie positive.Its boring, its never really Funny, its never really dramatic, its never really thrilling, it never makes you real curious.

The characters and plot seem to be in place but a lack of depth to both result in a confusing and somewhat frustrating film, surely 149 mins is sufficient time to create a short sharp history for its cast. Described as an action and adventure western, you get explosions with little adventure on a western set but just put together a little to mishmashy.

526,Thumper00123,Incredible,10,5 July 2013,"I tend to side with critics often, and usually find they are on target - case in point- Man of Steel - which I had the highest of hopes for, and felt it was mediocre at best. So, I went in to Lone Ranger with low expectations based on reviews I had read from the so called experts. I was a fan of the series as a kid. Was not sure what to expect from this. Well, This is the Lone Ranger movie for the 21st century. It was fantastic. What movie did these critics watch? It set a perfect tone. Depp was terrific. Hammer was pitch perfect - he became grew to be the Lone Ranger. It left me wanting more, and movies rarely do that for me. Spread the word of mouth - we need this movie to have legs so we get a much deserved sequel. Trust me, its GREAT. And my 7 y/o son loved it just as much.",The Lone Ranger
527,cmshannon-86949,The Lone Ranger Review,4,10 August 2018,"The Lone Ranger is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is probably the one I dislike the most. Below is a breakdown of the good and the bad in this movie.Adaptation: The Lone Ranger is an adaptation of the classic black and white western series from the 1940s. This is probably where the movie fails the greatest. There is a difference between taking creative liberties and changing things entirely. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter. The Lone Ranger is no longer a Texas Ranger, but a lawyer from back east. It's his brother that makes him a ranger. This causes him to come across as a boy scout rather than the tough but kind lawman from the show. Tonto is a shade of his former self with Johnny Depp's portrayal. In the show, Tonto saves the Lone Ranger after the rangers are ambushed and then they become partners. What I liked about the show was how Tonto would save the Lone Ranger just as many times as the Lone Ranger saved him. They are good friends. This didn't translate to the movie.Characters: Besides the fact the characters are not like they were in the show, they are underdeveloped and unlikable. John Reid (The Lone Ranger) comes across as very naive and timid. His adherence to the law becomes annoying in how it allows the bad guys to constantly escape. Tonto is essentially Jack Sparrow in the west. Johnny Depp made Tonto so odd in this movie with all of his mannerisms. He stares off into space a lot. Butch Cavendish is almost a caricature of a bad guy. He was fine, but seemed like the type of person that would only exist in the movies.Tone: The movie had some conflicting tonal choices. It would be ultra serious but then oddly comedic. There were parts that seemed more geared towards children, but then quite violent and scary moments as well.Action: The action scenes contributed the greatest to the odd tonal shifts. The train scene near the beginning was really over the top, especially the driving pin on the locomotive landing right between John and Tonto. The final train scene used as the finale was over the top as well, with trains smashing through each other.Score: Hans Zimmer's score for this movie was perfect. It combined traditional and modern musical styles in a very effective way. Part of the reason the finale was so fun was because of his version of the William Tell Overture.Logic Leaps: Tonto somehow escapes from prison, which is addressed by the kid he is telling the story to, but gives no explanation. Also, the horse Silver shows up in the most random ways such as on the rooftop. It's explained he is a spirit horse, but this just adds to how odd the movie is.Smaller Things: The meaning of the phrase Kemosabe is changed from ""trusty scout"" or ""faithful friend"" to ""wrong brother.""John has a family left at the end. He just leaves them behind to fight another day as the Lone Ranger.They make a joke out of Hi Ho Silver A-Way, which was the closing line of each episode of the show.The Good: The finale is probably the best and most exciting part. Defeating Cavendish, the corrupt army officer, and Mr. Cole (a twist villain) with trains is satisfying.The landscape shots are beautiful to look at.Instead of a black screen behind the credits, they use a shot of one of these landscapes.I give this movie a four out of ten because the finale was great and some parts made me laugh. This movie's biggest problems were in how it was a lousy adaptation, had weird tonal shifts, over the top action, and ultimately, tried to recreate the success of Pirates of the Caribbean with the Jack Sparrow performance with Tonto, the over the top action, and the oddities in the plot.This wasn't a terrible movie, but could have been way better.",The Lone Ranger
528,victore-24207,Johnny Depp hits it again!,8,17 January 2019,"Although I'm a few years too late I still find the film very amusing. Even with the problems hovering above this film I find to be a good movie for everyone who enjoys a good modern western or just come for the Johnny Depp humor.
Please do look away from the bad publicity and the bad reviews and also the fact someone did not like Mr. Depp to play as an native, but rather have an open mind to the movie and you will get tons of fun! Even a horse with a weird fetish for roofs...Technically you will see that the CGI is well done and the fight scenes although a theatrical fight looks real and can be enjoyed by everyone. And when you mix one of the best modern western scores to the mix it get's better!
Hans Zimmer did an wonderful job to make the soundtrack with a awesome 9 minute long William Tell finale and one of the best credit scores as well (only beaten by At world's end by my opinion)
The music, the scenery and the actors did an amazing job even though MR. Depp kinda stole some of the show from the others, but still an amazing job by everyone!If you want a modern take on the old classic and have an open mind please do watch this movie and have a good time. I at least have seen it more than enough, but never get enough of the elegance and humor from it!",The Lone Ranger
529,jmjeffrey,Don't Bother Wasting Your Money,2,5 August 2013,"This movie was even worse than the 1981 version. Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski made no attempt to remain true to the Lone Ranger mythology, instead allowing John Reid/The Lone Ranger to be portrayed as spoiled buffoon with less sense than a snapping turtle. The action sequences were beyond belief and defied the laws of physics. Although I can suspend reality, which is why I go to the movies in the first place, horses cannot climb trees, gallop along rooftops or across the tops of Pullman cars. Humans cannot survive train wrecks of epic proportions as generated by the special effects houses. I will concede that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Tonto was not as bad as I feared but he did resemble a Native American Captain Jack Sparrow. This movie was a thorough waste of my time and my money and Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski should be ashamed of themselves.",The Lone Ranger

They should rename it ""The Lone Ranger meets Capt Jack Sparrow"" This movie had promise if Johnny Depp would not have been cast as Tonto. People who know the Lone Ranger legend are aghast at this awful Disney product. Don't even rent the DVD, you time is more valuable! When the public goes to see a western genre movie they do not want their childhood heroes made fun of. The argument is that it is made for the younger generation, well the younger generation does not even know who the Lone Ranger was. Make a serious movie about the Lone Ranger, forget the over the top special effects and people will come in droves to see it.",The Lone Ranger

The premise looked promising to me. I was expecting a thorough entertainer. But it turned out the only good things about the movie were its trailers and the beautiful locations for it's wide angle shots. The acting isn't particularly bad, just that there isn't enough substance in the script to make a it a good watch. The hero isn't fantastical enough. The villains aren't menacing enough. There's a whole lot of action but the buildup to it isn't good enough, so its hard to care. Even if you are a Johnny Depp fan I would suggest you skip this movie. Everyone else is also forgettable, as is the movie.",The Lone Ranger
535,castlemgmt,Hilarious! A Great Movie!!,9,11 July 2013,"I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a long time. My wife was reluctant to go because of the comments about this movie being a bomb. But I wanted to see for myself what the talk was all about. Well we were both very pleasantly surprised. If you are expecting a rerun of the 50's TV series ""The Lone Ranger"" don't. This is the antithesis of that TV show.This is a great parody of that show and all the old westerns. It has amusing situations with smart one liners. If you look at it carefully, this is not a western, this is a comedy. It's well worth seeing.The only problem I had with this movie was that it contained too many story lines. These story lines should have been broken up and made into TWO great movies.",The Lone Ranger
536,wyndsayl,Kind of Sucked,4,9 August 2013,"The first half hour and last half hour were pretty good. The rest was stupid, boring, and a hot mess. They made the Lone Ranger an idiot and Tonto a loon.I am so over Johnny Depp's shtick. It's all the same really. He's become a cartoon character actor.The story had a lot of potential and could have been good. But it blew the possibilities by attempts to go for cheap laughs, attempts which didn't really generate any laughs because they weren't really funny.All the action in the world won't make up for a lack of story.And why, oh why, do the majority of remakes turn into farces. It rarely fails where they take shows that were beloved, and mostly serious even if light hearted, and create a remake that is just stupid trying to be funny. They did that with this show, just like they did with ""Land of the Lost"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"", and numerous others. All of these had humorous moments, and were light hearted due to their circumstances but none of them were comedies. Dark Shadows was very serious in the show itself, the situation and live TV brought in some humorous situations but it wasn't a comedy by any stretch. The remakes are attempts at comedies that don't even reach that level and end up being farcical jokes. They don't seem to even bother to figure out what made the original tick, why people liked them, what was the heart of the show. And they mostly fail because of it. I think they end up being vanity projects for the actor/director. Really expensive vanity projects.The only exception I can think of was Battlestar Galactica. The original was a serious intent, that was watered down quite a bit because of society and TV at the time, but it was always a serious situation. The remake change a lot of superficial things but not only did it take the original seriously, it accomplished what the original was trying to do. More should follow that lead.I can usually find something in a movie to like but I was just waiting for it to be over. I would have walked out but I kept waiting for it to get better. The people I was with were also unimpressed. We couldn't suspend reality and enter the movie at all. I just sat there think this is really stupid, dumb, and therefore boring. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. It was really disappointing.",The Lone Ranger
537,shasashu,1 of the worst movies ever,2,14 May 2014,"This was the most boring movies i have seen in recent time. I will keep the review very simple in plain sentences. there was hardly any point in the movie where you feel exited or interested to see what will happen next; and if you still get exited because of your own imaginations or curiosity, you will be disheartened. the story and characters of the movie are boring and lifeless. I watched the movie at home without any distractions with good concentration. i can usually tolerate dull or slow progressing movies to see what will happen next and till the end, and i get satisfied if the movie makes sense and has a good ending. but this movie was so boring, my wife went to sleep after watching it for 30 minutes. i watched it for 1 and half hour expecting something exiting is going to happen. then later on i had to skip 10-20 seconds of movie quiet a few times so that i am able to finish this boring and irritating movie. Armie's character in the movie is so irritating coz he doesn't do anything in spite of been given many chances. I even didn't like johnny depp's character. only hardcore johnny depp's fans could tolerate this movie, and i think they are quiet many of them considering the rating of this movie. for me, watching this movie was a complete waste of 2 and half hours of my life time. it would have been better utilized even if i stared on a goat eating grass for 2 and half hours.",The Lone Ranger
538,pfe1190,Very Enjoyable,7,12 August 2013,"I saw this film last night and had to persuade my friend to come along. He had obviously read the unfair criticism regarding this film. When I saw the original teaser trailer for the film I got the impression it would be a serious take on the classic hero, subsequent trailers showed the humorous side too. Knowing the tone of the film I had the impression it would have a Pirates of the Caribbean feel, with some great characters and action blended with humour and some darker emotion. I must say I really enjoyed the film, the humour is excellent and I'm sure had the screen been busier the larger audience would have amplified the laughter. The relationship between the two main characters is fun to watch develop and I quite liked Armie Hammer not remembering seeing him in anything previously. I would certainly recommend seeing this film, it's a feel good summer action / adventure that's not too serious. Even my friend who was reluctant to watch it had only good things to say about it after. If you are on the fence about watching it just go and see for yourself and make your own judgements. I'll certainly be buying it on Blu-ray.",The Lone Ranger
539,jaqhuff,OK for children who can sit through a long film...,5,20 February 2014,"This is a difficult one to place regarding who would get most out of a viewing. For children old enough to view mild violence, this would be a good film to pass the time, yet it's a bit on the long side for most children to sit and watch without a break.I found it irritating and generally dull and clichéd; such a shame as Johnny Depp is one of my favourite actors. His 'Tonto' is a bit like a native American Jack Sparrow, so I think he may need to stretch himself a bit and show everyone what he can still do well.To be frank, I found myself easily distracted during this film and I found the 'Lone Ranger' himself annoying. It was such a stereotypical role, the 'good' law abiding brother, trying to live up to his older 'cool' maverick brother and having to learn how to blur the lines in order to get anything done. Guided by a 'comedy Indian' who, for all his apparent failings, is really the clever one (a la Jack Sparrow).Some mild 'Dinsney-esque' references to the harsh conditions for Chinese workers on the railway, a split-second image of the buffalo herds being separated by the rail tracks, something which played a role in their ultimate demise due to the loss of migration routes...etc etc.It's all there, just 'Disneyfied', which is not real surprise I admit. It simply adds to the frustrations of this remake of a story so globally ingrained.This is not to say that there are not any enjoyable moments, good performances, a few laughs and some good action. Hence, my return to the start of this review - if you are approximately 12-15 years of age, interested in action and not too bothered about good dialogue and can sit still for 2+ hours, you will love it I'm sure! If you, at any age, prefer your films to explore and acknowledge the realities of the American Wild West, without the Disney gloss, watch something else.",The Lone Ranger
540,tommydtcb,Truly a waste of hard earned money,1,4 July 2013,"The Lone Ranger, who's fight for justice throughout the old west was brought to legendary status by Clayton Moore back in the 50s, is now being portrayed on the big screen as an inept fool, better suited to play a remake of Barney on Mayberry. What a shameful way to destroy the memory of such an iconic figure of the old west. It's interesting to note how the director has taken the liberty of turning this movie into a comedy, not an action filled movie with a little humor thrown in, but an actual comedy, just not a funny one. If you have money to burn, and your time is worth nothing at all, and you've seen every other movie that's ever been made, and the power is out at your house, and your only other choice is trying to read ""The History of Sock Mending"" by flashlight, then go see it.",The Lone Ranger

Case in point, Adam Beach who has consistently turned in solid performances and proved his comedic bones in Joe Dirt. I wasn't familiar with Armie Hammer but he did remind me a lot of Judge Reinhold, an actor I've never taken to and similar impressions surfaced here for Hammer. Definitely not a casting made in Heaven from my humble point of view. While I appreciate hamming it up at the best of times, I felt Hammer over played his hand while Depp fell just a bit flat at times. I enjoyed the inclusion of William Fitchner but the role was predictable none the less. Redeeming factors? None for me save the appearance of Barry Pepper who could have as easily played the role given to Fitchner and been deserving of more screen time. My attention and care factor got up and went around the 90 minute mark but all in all, a slightly enjoyable romp into yesteryear.",The Lone Ranger

Tried to play it both ways and it didn't work. I was so disappointed.The relationship between Tonto and the Lone Ranger was fractured and uncomfortable. Tonto is played as a mental patient (think Jack Sparrow with more makeup) and the Lone Ranger is played as a anti gun, lucky shot, not ready for prime time hero. Tonto's sarcastic humor was impossible to accept, he isn't a nincompoop, but sure comes off that way.If it would have been played straight, it could have worked out really well.

Combining the elements of comedy and fantasy with a very bitter and realistic story has chocked the movie. Unless the first and last sequences, the film's dramatic background doesn't allow the inclusion of elements of parody, and the Mr. Verbinsky's efforts, who has already succeeded to make a perfect parody of western movies (Rango), fails. At the center (in the core) of The Lone Ranger lies a western in classical form, devoid of fantasy or Humorous arrays, that in current shape is buried beneath a mass of unfunny jokes, inappropriate special effects, undeveloped relationships between characters and numerous and futile Occurrences.",The Lone Ranger

Why is this rated so badly?,8,18 August 2013,"I literally came back from watching this film 10 minutes ago, and wasn't expecting anything that great - I've never watched the TV series, knew anything about The Lone Ranger, and don't tend to go for films of this genre. However, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it more than Pirates Of The Caribbean (& I used to be a massive fan of that as a kid). DON'T listen to the low reviews AT ALL. It's most certainly not boring, even from the start, and it seems to get you hooked until the end. The only reason I rated this at an 9 is that the action/adventure genre is not my preference, but on how well it was made and performed, I don't see why it shouldn't be rated as a 10.The only thing I can think of regarding the low reviews is that some people must have expected it to be serious - it's definitely got austere moments when the situation calls for it (as I would want), but it's got plenty of humour; particularly with Johnny Depp as Tonto, as you can imagine. If you like any of Johnny Depp's performances as eccentric characters, or you are a fan of Pirates Of The Caribbean, I recommend you give it a watch.

I agree it was cheesy, predictable, and some of the jokes were forced, but that's what I expect when seeing a movie like Lone Ranger.The movie bombed in the box office not because it's a terrible movie, but because nobody is interested in watching Westerns anymore.

I went with a friend who really didn't want to go (she told me it was probably going to be terrible). She was so wrong. The movie was quick, clever, funny, and had a modern feel to it in terms of being a western movie. I've never seen Armie Hammer before, but I would again. His performance was well-acted, and well-scripted (thank you writers). Johnny Depp again met my standards. He was funny as Tonto and was totally immersed in his character. The movie added some comedy and paid homage to those classic westerns with horses, train fights, revolvers, and bad guys.

The potential to do the Comedy/Western Wild Wild West should have been is there, amply evident, on the screen... Big money was spent! TLR is a great looking flick! Beautifully shot, with breathtaking action set-pieces, and panoramic Western vistas... TLR's impact is diluted because director Gore Verbinsky and star/producer Johnny Depp try to have it both ways-to do both Great Comedy and Great Drama-with mixed results, all too often throwing Us out of the story... But when the Old West ""Dynamic Duo"" charge into battle, to the accompaniment of The William Tell Overture, our adrenaline still gets flowing, and our hearts still get pumping!

The films structure is held together with bubble gum... TLR asks Johnny Depp to carry the film doing shtick, in clown face, rather than tell the story of The Lone Ranger Us old folks remember from the 50's TV show, and the even earlier radio show...

550,rohitmasquez,Shame that people believed the critics so blindly!,10,17 July 2013,"Firstly, Let me clarify.. This by no means is a 10/10 movie. The movie has already bombed at the box office, I gave 10 hoping at least IMDb rating for this movie looked fair. This movie definitely deserves a 7, if not more.The major problem they say is the length of the movie, yes it is correct. The movie is lengthy, but why would you care about the length when you are being entertained? The only problem with the movie is it slows down a little here and there, but the amount of fun and visual spectacle we get to see should easily make you forget that.If you have a look at the positives, there are plenty. Star cast is perfect. Hammer as Lone ranger is spot on, Wilkinson is menacing, and Fichtner is ruthless. But the movie is focused mostly on Tonto, which is a quirky character and who else is better than playing it other than Depp. Sure, you can draw a few similarities between Tonto and Jack sparrow, but Tonto has his own story and reasons and you will eventually like Tonto. That is where Depp triumphs.Technically the movie is awesome. All those sets and action explains why they had to spend 200+ million on this movie. And the Background music by Zimmer is not his greatest, but it goes well with the movie.Do not go by what the critics are saying, This movie IS an entertainer.",The Lone Ranger

My review this time is not about the plot or acting or any of the usual stuff, but the music score for this movie. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers so i am actually not happy to be saying this but the score in Lone Ranger was very disappointing and it spoiled the movie for me. I guess westerns are harder to grasp, and its not really Hans' genre. I do pick up some of his signature tunes here and there but the entire mix was just an awkward clash of genres. There wasn't any true blue western tunes in the movie (which i was looking forward to), other than the legendary Lone Ranger tune, which brings me to another point. At times it just comes out of nowhere and it was fitted for the sake of fitting it in. Audio mix could've been better as well.",The Lone Ranger

There is some violence, but nothing like some movies. We are spared most of the details. Armie Hammer plays this part exactly as it should be. We watch him change from a dork to the Lone Ranger. Johnny Depp is totally Tonto - at least as we now would like him to be. He is always good and never lets us down in this movie. Be sure to sit in your seat until the very end - it's worth it. The scenery is awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie. Oh, yes, there is a LOT of action and some borrowing from Back to The Future III - but it's awesome too!

555,planninefromareafiftyone,Everybody involved with this should wear a mask and get out of town by sunset,3,8 July 2013,"Westerns haven't been on the radar much lately, and stuff like this is the reason. This movie's one-dimensional ""violence rocks!"" message doesn't work for fans of the classic Lone Ranger, who was a hero who helped downtrodden people because it was the right thing to do. It doesn't work for those too young to remember the character, either, since the way he's presented here is simply not exciting or compelling. It's not enough to use a character;s name; viewers expect something on the screen that's worth watching. This isn't.Tonto morphing into Captain Jack Sparrow is annoying, and misses the apparently intended humor. Since when do 19th Centurt Natiive-Americans wear post-Apocalyptic biker barbarian imitation leather? Johnny Depp's acting is up to par, but the director gave him an out-of-place sideshow freak character. To make matters worse, this is supposed to be the guy who's narrating his memories of these events. Filtered through his wisecracking persona like a prism, you end up not knowing what;s going on or why. The Ranger himself suffers even worse indignity, being depicted as a klutzy comic relief: he even gets rolled in manure at one point. There's some unnecessary garbage tossed in for cheap shock value, and takes away from what little story telling there is. Rabbits with odd eating habits, people getting graphically shot up, weak humor in inappropriate moments, and much more. It's a mess.A lot of money was wasted in the production of this film. It's hard to say what they spent all that money on, other than some weirdly gratuitous excesses. Avoid.",The Lone Ranger
556,dale-haynes,"Another smart, ambitious American film about America from...Disney?",10,22 July 2013,"In 1995 Disney distributed a beautiful, ambitious, heartfelt valentine to America called Tall Tale --- see my IMDb review --- that, like this 2013 film, underperformed commercially. Both are tragicomic exercises in truth telling appropriate for older children and all the more subversive for it. As with TT, I was surprised by the DEGREE of truth in a mere flick from which I sought at best lovingly crafted, internally coherent entertainment. In both films the railroad, a potentially benevolent tool, is the vehicle of rapacious tyranny sold as progress --- ""Hell on Wheels"" (that historically accurate phrase, used as the title of an AMC series, is both directly referenced and in the luxury train car sequence visually symbolized), the real history of which, including the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, was not written by Jesus --- that degradingly, murderously created one nation under Wall Street. Both finally entrust the awful truth of their fables to a child. The ambitious, inevitably --- I'll hazard DELIBERATELY --- uncomfortable meld of slapstick and slaughter apparently has confused many. That confusion, including positive but shallow reviews, is a disturbing snapshot of a casually depraved America unable to see carefully filmed carnage as an intentional warning. The film, with its silver bullet of legacy, is hip to its iconography, even musically, to the end. The story's embellishments, however outlandish, are, as the product of a character's traumatic memory, internally consistent with the traumatized eccentricity of the devastated old storyteller, his epic life reduced to a carnival sideshow, whose well-demonstrated ironic mix of skepticism and faith compliments the mantra ""nature out of balance."" Depp & Company never forget, even in the final credits, the sorrow on which their American version of the human comedy so maniacally capers. The unexpected horror of the most violent scenes makes it impossible, despite careful direction that skirts an R rating, to review or promote it honestly as a lighthearted romp without revealing (to anyone not too jaded to notice) the reviewer's/promoter's depravity. Once that seriousness became brutally obvious, the core indictment of a nation founded on genocidal rapine, whose politicos and military are ultimately in the service of pampered corporate pharoahs not the people (a train named ""Constitution"" goes off the tracks), clicked. Only that indictment, which the cannibalism and massacres are equal to, could justify the violence and budget. Depp, Bruckheimer, and Disney, wealthy entities with little to fear, have given us a large pie in the face...and a mirror. I could believe the latter two perhaps didn't totally understand the film they were making with a Box Office Darling. The ultra-sophisticated Depp is another matter. More than expensively buttered popcorn with a bite this is outlaw filmmaking, from insiders no less, at its boldest, grandest, and most disturbingly misunderstood. Johnny Depp, if my reading isn't completely off, you are one hell of a patriot. Like your film's John Reid, you've been celebrated by the status quo but not co-opted. ""Never take the mask off."" That would be a ""bad trade.""",The Lone Ranger
557,rupertlameze,Why 7/10?,7,31 August 2013,"Why I gave this movie a 7? Well i have more reasons. First i'd like to say there are holes in the movie, like how did Tonto get out of jail. Another reason is that first 25 minutes of the movie was way too boring, nothing was happening.. I'd accept first 5-10 minutes but 25 minutes was too much. And the third reason is that the story line was complicated, many characters, names and it was hard to understand everything, specially because of the ""Tonto talking to the little boy"" interrupts and cutting of from one scene to another, without knowing what happened in between. Now positive things are that I can commend Johnny Depp for well acting and not disappointing his fans, and good ending of the movie.",The Lone Ranger

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a summer block buster full of eye candy and humorous dialog. During parts of the movie it feels like it wants to be a serious film but the reigns are pulled back with a silly scene or a piece of funny dialog. This is without a doubt a Johnny Depp movie (who was surprisingly good as Tonto) but being so the character of the Lone Ranger is severely undermined. I kept waiting for the Lone Ranger to start whooping up on the bad guys but it never really happens. The cut scenes between the present and the past past were a little awkward and slowed down the pace of the movie. The final 20 minutes or so will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Anybody who is looking for the equivalent of John Wayne here is way off base, this is meant to be a fun adventure film that keeps you laughing and engaged. Depp is hilarious, and the lines that tie back into the old TV show are great. Everyone in the theater we were with was laughing and thoroughly enjoying it; it's an adventure set in the old west with two of America's most classic characters, what's not to like? Has some parts that make it not for kids under 12 in my opinion, but for adults is a great night out for a throwback to classic American radio and TV. Wife and I loved it.

I have just been to see this with my family and friends and I was genuinely surprised at what a good film this is. I thought it was fast paced, and the action sequences were very well executed - with a good mix of action and humour throughout. I could wax lyrical around the competence and skill of cast and crew but the key to my enjoyment of this film was that it really was a great deal of fun and wasn't afraid to laugh at itself - and we laughed right along with it. All the elements came together. This wasn't a rehash of that great TV series we watched as children - but something for a new generation.Spoiler - when The Lone Ranger theme tune began, I looked around the packed cinema and every man, woman and child had a grin on their faces.

The film has been slated by the Film Critics, which has ruined any chance of this film doing as well as it should. It really has a little bit of everything & Johnny Depp doing no wrong as his portrayal of Tonto brings the much needed light humour to prevent the film being taken too seriously. Armie Hammer also plays his part very well with humour & seriousness cleverly mixed. You just hate the bad guy & want him to get whats coming to him throughout. The original Lone Ranger music sent goosebumps through me & brought everything together. There is a story, a plot, plenty of action & humour.

Silver standing in the tree was the perfect image: WTF was anyone who had anything to do with this bomb thinking? One seriously has to wonder if Sony is going to exist after their summer money pits. This is obviously what Spielberg had in mind when he said just a few weeks ago that a few mega-flick flops are going to cause a meltdown in Hollywood.

Armie Hammer is the perfect straight man to Johnny Depp. Depp shows a great sense of comedic timing and the laugh lines are pure gold. This action packed film has wonderful cinematography, and the special effects are outstanding. The storyline is predictable, but it is the Lone Ranger after all. I liked the story telling angle and the young boy who was not quite sold on the truthfulness of the ""Noble Savage's"" tale. I cannot understand how film critics make their money, when they miss so badly in their assessment of what the average viewer wants.

The music is spectacular, as was the action and choreography. Would have like to see more dialog of the Indians and more screen time with Helena Bonham Carter's character (even though I think she is a bit over rated).

565,NuttyForMovies,"Bland, Boring and Barbaric",1,6 July 2013,"I think Rotten Tomatoes finally got it right this time. Giving this film less than 25% approval rating is on the mark. I wasn't a fan of the original series, but I knew that from the trailers, I probably would not like this film. I still gave it a shot, and boy did it fail to deliver, miserably. This movie is essentially a Pirates of The Caribbean movie, set in the Old West. Johnny Depp as Tonto is doing the same old shtick he did in Pirates, Jack Sparrow basically wandering through the desert. His attempts at humor are the same, deadpan expressions as he wanders through overly exaggerated and unrealistic special effects sequences. His sidekick (sorry, but that's essentially how the power relationship is set in this film) is a scared, gun-shy lawyer John Reid played by Armie Hammer. Throughout the movie, we are supposed to be cheering this guy on, hoping he can avenge the death of his brother and bring the bad guys to justice. But all he does is whine and complain. They should have called him The Moan Ranger. Depps performance was quite bad, and I would say, offensive to native Americans of all nations. The way he talked, his behavior, I mean, they tried to explain it away as him having been scarred emotionally as a kid, but really, it sounded more like an apology for Depp's stereotypical portrayal. There were also weird random things that left one's head scratching, like the crazy rabbits that popped up. What the heck? Are we to believe that this stuff was based on reality, or are just watching the fantasy laden recollections of an aged Tonto who's liberally adding these elements to entertain the little boy in the 1933 museum? The part about the movie that really bother me, however, was the fact it had an overall feel that it was geared towards families, but there were scenes of such nasty brutality and violence, it was a really upsetting juxtaposition. Now, I'm all for gory and violent films, I watch them all the time. But those films are rated 18A. This one gets away with a PG or PG-13 rating, but people die horribly, and in many cases, for no reason. I guess the fact that they don't show any blood spurting out is why the censors and ratings board gave it a pass. Overall this film is quite boring. I was taking power naps through many of the slow parts. It barely picks up speed, and when it does, you don't really care anymore. And why just have one locomotive crashing scenes when you can have two! Yes, two train crashes in the same film, talk about losing creativity. It felt very repetitive. None of the supporting characters or actors stood out. And quite frankly they felt just as annoying as The Lone Ranger himself. I think the white horse was the most interesting character on the screen. Avoid this movie, just rent it for $2 out of your local movie dispensing machine. Send the studios a message, so they won't make any sequels, and they'll bury this attempt at a franchise for good.",The Lone Ranger

You're just about to cry one second and laughing your ass off the next second and then there are horses and trains thundering at you...it's a wild ride. There's never a dull moment except for a few necessary plot-developing scenes (The critic who said it was boring obviously didn't actually see this film) and the characters are wonderful and of course the action is spectacular.

So this movie is pretty much a comic-book-super-hero movie...Except that Tonto is not the stereotypical sidekick as in the originals. Here, he is every bit a super-hero himself, with his own painful backstory and agenda.And Depp manages to portray him with a very fine line combining all of the above....the super-hero, the drama, the moral undertone, the comic-book character, the sidekick... the FUN.I doubt that there are many actors on this planet who could have done it as well....",The Lone Ranger

The only thing that was bad about this movie was its ending.

Depp is a different take on Tonto, although his charismatic charm displayed as Captain Jack Sparrow is there as well. Fans of the old Lone Ranger will be surprised by this one, but there are moments that give homage to the original duo. Arnie Hammer is good as the Lone Ranger as well. Not what I expected, but he did command the role. By the end, you realize this movie could have been much much worse with different actors.All in all I give this an 8-10 for family movies. If your kids are old enough to follow a story and enjoy a good laugh along the way, I recommend this film. Cinematography could be better, story was good but could have been condensed, report was clear between characters, backdrops were excellent, and the acting was an A-.

This movie is Disney's most violent movie I have ever seen and not only violent, but gross violent ""NOT FOR KIDS"". The Lone Ranger gets very violent and intense a lot, then throws in a funny Johnny moment that would work if this show didn't get so intense and violent. These scenes do not work together at all if you get into the plot. By the end of the show you want the Lone Ranger to disappear and you expect Johnny's character to commit suicide. It's like the good guys don't really win after all the carnage that has come to pass. To not give anything away, its like watching ""Custard Last Stand"". No one really wins, his army looses and in the end the Indians end up losing there land or getting killed by another army anyway.

I think that his character should have been toned down just a bit in this movie. In the original show Tonto agreed with the thoughts and plans of the Lone Ranger but most of the ideas came from the LR. This scenario is reversed or so it seems.Tonto was certainly not stupid in his own right.

578,stephen_delaunay,Where'd Mickey's money go...,5,4 October 2013,"Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear and get a pie in the face.In an early scene, Johnny Depp's Tonto expresses shock and loathing when the spirit horse stands majestically at the foot of the open grave of John Reid, anointing the tender-foot Eastern lawyer as the Masked Man. The graves of six slaughtered Rangers are passed over by the glorious steed. Tonto, who has witnessed the ineptitude of John Reid as a sanctimonious klutz in life, tries repeatedly to lead the horse to the resting place of John's heroic brother, who was, after all, a real Ranger, not a hastily deputized tag-along. The spirit horse stubbornly and inexplicably returns to John Reid. This is all done as slap-stick, mostly not funny, and deeply disappointing to anyone hoping to see some honor bestowed on the legend of the Lone Ranger.The Lone Ranger doesn't waste any time in announcing its intention to reduce the legend of the Masked Man to a goofy romp. It opens with a young boy wearing a Lone Ranger mask strolling through a Wild West museum. The kid somehow animates Tonto in an exhibit titled: ""Nobel Savage in his Natural Habitat."" The ancient Tonto (it's now 1933) recounts the true story of the Long Ranger to the boy. Where did they get the idea to do this, the Princess Bride? It made sense in that movie, the Princess Bride being a bedtime story, a fairy tale. In The Lone Ranger, it's just an unfunny antic out of left field. Let me just add here that in the original TV series, Jay Silverheels, a Canadian Mohawk, played the faithful companion Tonto as a thoughtful and wise Native American, even though he wasn't loath to do an occasional spoof of the character in later years. Clayton Moore played the role of the Lone Ranger with a respect for the character as deep as his baritone voice, which he cultivated to match the radio version of the show. In fact, he's the only actor to share his star in Hollywood with the name of his most famous role: Clayton Moore – The Lone Ranger. Sure, maybe Clayton went overboard, but he loved the character and that must have played a part in keeping the show on the air for 169 episodes and the first big hit for the new network, ABC. So maybe we're a more cynical world now. Maybe we want our heroes complex and nuanced, but, handled with a little more care, there just might still be a market for this old classic. Okay, so here they wanted to turn the original story on its head. Fair enough. There's nothing sacred here. Tonto isn't the companion in this version, the Lone Ranger is, for it has been ordained that a warrior will be chosen by the spirit horse to assist Tonto in his quest. Johnny Depp does nothing to enhance his stature as the quirky mystic on a mission. Armie Hammer may not suffer the same fate as Klinton Spilsburry, who has never worked again after bombing in the first remake of the legend, but he will certainly leave this performance off his resume if he applies for The Dark Knight in some future project.You want to make a Turkey with all that Disney cash, go ahead. My investment was small. I'll get over it. On the other hand, Mickey, having coughed up $200 million, might stay mad for a while. ""Who was that masked man?"" Who cares?

You got a Depp!",9,6 October 2013,"I'll bet a lot of you panners out there were expecting an edgy and gritty movie in the Ford, Tarrentino or Leone mold, since Johnny Depp was in the lead and creatively involved from the movie's inception. And you were so disappointed. What you saw was a brilliantly constructed and spectacularly presented effort, a near perfect adaption and a reactive view perhaps to the best comedic elements of Blazing Saddles and Little Big Man. A parody of parodies.But what really rang my bell was how Depp interpreted the flawed, disavowed and orphaned Native American character; in spite of the self- effacing comedic foundation; raised him to the stature of the leading character of the movie. Depp is always surprising us, and he did it again. Revisionist history, inaccurate Native American symbolism? Just let it be.

Yes, if it's free...I saw it on a flight back from Germany. It's a fun movie but it had the possibility to be so much more than it was. If you're expecting a heroic Lone Ranger you'll be disappointed. The Lone Ranger character rises to the challenges before him in the movie but just barely. Some of the scenes are inspired, others are so heavily CGI'd they're ridiculous. For instance, a man on a horse riding through the passenger cars of a train. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on long shots with a pistol, wild jumps on / off trains, etc. but that scene was just too much. All that while the original LR theme (William Tell Overture) was playing felt like an insult to me. I guess I can accept another take on the LR story, but when you try to draw it (this movie) back to the B&W Clayton Moore / Jay Silverheels stories that hacks me off. The biggest mistake was the LR character. A New England lawyer prosecutor comes out west to civilize the WW West - yea right. So our LR can't even fire a gun without looking petrified. This is not a retake on the old Lone Ranger story, it is a complete rewrite. One more thing, what's with the goofy looking cowboy hats on the good guys? This LR has absolutely no style. Funny that Hollywood can make multiple good Superman movies, but can't once seem to get the Lone Ranger right.",The Lone Ranger
581,Brita-Hansen,A great escapist movie,9,27 November 2013,"Like many other reviewers here, I was not expecting this movie to be great because of the general poor reviews, but I can only echo others: ""What film did the critics see!?"" It cannot have been the same Lone Ranger film that I saw - a great escapist adventure romp. I grew up watching the original TV series, so I was interested to see the concept from Tonto's perspective and I thought that it was a great way of explain how The Lone Ranger came to be. There were several ""laugh-out-loud"" moments ... feeding the crow, but especially the rabbits ... very Pythonesgue! This film never sets out to be serious cinema, rather it sets out to be an entertaining romp in the style of the old Saturday afternoon matinées, and in that it totally succeeds. Johnny and Armie work well together. Dare I suggest that the film could have been a bit longer to develop some of the other characters a bit more. Overall, if you want to go and spend a couple of hours of pure escapist fun, adventure and great stunts, then this is a film you should definitely see!",The Lone Ranger
582,LogBran,This Isn't The Lone Ranger From TV,4,28 December 2013,"In the TV series that the grandparents of our world grew up with (1949-1957), the Lone Ranger was a fearless man, riding the plains dispensing justice with his faithful sidekick Tonto. Not so in this movie. John Reid is an inept, naive lawyer moving out West to go back to his hometown, where his brother lives. In the train attack scene at the beginning of the movie, Reid (Armie Hammer), who is obsessed with justice, and would much rather hold a gavel than a revolver, actually prevents Tonto from shooting Butch Cavendish, who escapes and later orchestrates the murder of Reid's brother and the rest of the Texas Rangers. Gore Verbinski develops Hammer's character so he can later become the bold and fearless Lone Ranger, but the utter naiveté of John Reid at the beginning of the movie makes the first real action scene seem comedic and ridiculous. Starting the movie, it looks like the flop that it was in the box office. However, there is hope for the Lone Ranger movie. That comes in the mystical Indian form of Tonto. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not the biggest Johnny Depp fan. However, I loved him as Tonto in this movie. Depp delivers lines with Hammer in such a way that you can't help but smile every time the guy opens his mouth. Since Verbinski has directed several films with Depp, that helps make Tonto into the interesting and funny character he is. Tonto is an Indian. He has his prejudices and beliefs. It was like that in the TV series. However, Johnny Depp brings him to life in a way that is completely new and captivating. The movie appropriately closes with John Reid as the Lone Ranger, rearing up on Silver and delivering his trademark line, ""Hi Ho Silver, Away!"" However, Tonto blankly stares at him and quickly tells the Ranger, ""Don't ever do that again!"" It's moments like that and others throughout the movie that make me really enjoy Johnny Depp as Tonto.And when the bumbling Reid finally decides to grow a spine and actually use his revolver on people, it's smooth sailing from there. Well, not quite. He saves his brother's wife and kid from Cavendish and a scheming train investor in a scene that blows the opening action scene out of the water, then is happily commended and decides to ""never remove the mask.""All in all, the key to watching the Lone Ranger is to make it through the first hour. Tonto makes it more bearable, but that first hour makes it look cheesy and dull as anything. If you get through that part, you get to enjoy watching Reid embrace the fearless Lone Ranger persona and become the hero from the '50s. It's just a shame that it couldn't deliver for the whole two and a half hours.",The Lone Ranger
583,c-christine-finlay,Silver & Johnny should get Oscars,10,30 December 2013,"And about time too, a fabulous tale of heroes and heroines from the Comanche perspective. Lots of too too glorious scenery with fairytale spirits and a magical white horse that totally steals the show. Can't understand why critics, in particular the Guardian panned it. The Guardian is supposed to be v.v.v. left, so a story of social justice from an Indigenous perspective about stupid white capitalist men should be right up its alley. Probably jealous of Johnny, so many are. Depp gave a fabulous performance as Tonto, somehow managing to be extraordinarily riveting wearing a dead crow.They panned The Tourist, another extremely clever and original Depp movie. Maybe critics don't like originality. For me, The Lone Ranger was the best movie I've seen all year. Cowboys and Indians, Comanche spirit guardians, a roller-coaster-ride plot, brilliant visuals AND humor. THE TOTALLY TOTALLY BEST!!!!",The Lone Ranger

585,ybarraal-970-488658,The Lone Ranger,8,16 April 2014,"This was a great and fun movie that will have you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. I loved how much action that it contained, and all of the special affects that were added. At first, I wasn't really sure about watching this movie. Then, I decided to watch it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time while I was watching this movie, and was really shocked about how great the acting was, and the props and set design made me feel like I was actually back in the 1930's when the setting took place. I also liked how the movie was told in the 1st person format, which made the movie very unique. Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer did a great job acting out their roles in this movie. This movie was well edited and well written. The Lone Ranger is a great film that the whole family will enjoy. If you have not seen this film yet, I recommend seeing this humorous and action adventure movie.",The Lone Ranger
586,sgj030615,Wish there hadn't been something more interesting to do at the time...,7,2 May 2014,"Having recently watched the Flashforward series online, I experienced a sense of deja vu while watching this film. I found myself hoping that there would be more to come; beyond what I knew would be the end of this phase of the journey with Johnny and Armie. A feeling that the story was not finished, the adventure had only just begun and I wanted to know more. Then I remembered. I remembered that money and, in the case of visual entertainment, viewing figures talk. This film cost a lot and, clearly, not enough people went to see it; since I understand it was judged a flop. Therefore, my conclusion must be that, the reason that my entertainment must come to an end is that there was something more interesting to do while this film was on at the cinema (I believe that Flashforward had a similar problem with its TV scheduling). After all, I didn't catch it at the cinema; I watched it on a tablet through an online streaming service. Still, great entertainment while it lasted, just wish there hadn't been something more interesting to do while it was on at the cinema. If there hadn't, my entertainment might not have come to an end.",The Lone Ranger

They both deserve awards for their performances. Throughout the entire movie we were on the edge of our seats and laughing. There were no dull moments as we enjoyed learning the ""history"" of The Lone Ranger and Tonto. Although CG imagery was most likely used in the action scenes, it was so well done, the typical viewer wasn't even aware. The background scenery, filmed in several states including our own New Mexico, was breathtaking. In addition, the theater was full and it seemed the audience was sharing our enjoyment with many staying to watch the final credit. We are ready to go see it again and certainly will add it to our video library when available. It is a GEM! Don't miss it!",The Lone Ranger
588,jafem,This TRAMPLES on the legend of the Lone Ranger,3,27 June 2014,"Entertaining, yes, with a lot of great special effects. My main complaint is this – why I marked this a 3 - I would not mind revisions to a classic story, IF the revisions did not severely tarnish the legend of the super-clean cowboy hero - but that is exactly what they have done. ***I'm glad the Indians are treated better in this than in many old westerns - I'm part Indian. But Tonto's tribe is in Utah, so it should have been a Utah tribe, not Comanche – and why would Utah Tonto have rescued the Texas Ranger in Texas? The 1933 beginning, with Tonto alive but lifeless in a sideshow, now at least 84 (if 20 in 1869), was nonsensical and never explained.Cursing is mild, compared to raunchiness in many modern movies, but some of the curses are by the Lone Ranger! COMPLETELY out of character, dishonoring his reputation for a new generation which does not know the radio or TV hero. IMHO, the 1981 version was better - but I still prefer the purity of the TV series.",The Lone Ranger
589,anupamhore4,Well-made And Entertaining,7,19 August 2015,"I watched this movie about six or seven months ago for the first time and liked it. Then I thought about reviewing this one as many people has said negative things about this movie. I really do not understand why some people judged this one as a poorly made or lame movie because the way I see it, this is one of the very well-made movie of 2013 which is not only magically entertaining but also has every potential a good western-action film needs and more. One of the qualities this film holds that the story, acting and directing style was very much innovative, very much different from how a lone ranger film should've been made. The story seems to be very common for a western-action movie especially if you have watched Zorro films. As both Zorro and he Lone Ranger is the same at some point, I expected some similarities but instead of that, I got a well-written story with a good plot which mixes western roughly textured-action atmosphere with Red Indian mystical essence that make this a magically enjoyable film. The mystic essence was never a part of the original Lone Ranger TV show I assume, but that is one of the things that made this film innovative. The other thing is the story telling style. And the humors and Witt was also well-written, and the film is able of holding someone to the end. You will be excited even though you know the almost predictable ending. That is where this film becomes a good and entertaining one. The casting was excellent. Aarmie Hammer nailed it as John Reid. His acting was great. A guy who was obsessed with fighting the crime in systematic way and after facing the crucial fact that is the system is owned by the criminals, he becomes the lone ranger. Who could be a better choice? Aarmie's acting was realistic, humorous and enjoyable and he succeeded to unify himself with the character. There's absolutely no need to talk about Will Fichtner as Butch, he was terrific within his limit. The other characters were good also, but personally I didn't find Ruth Wilson's acting satisfying. And at last, Johnny Depp! Beloved Tonto! Some said that this Tonto character was one of those which proved that Johnny has lost his touch. I say otherwise. Johnny was charismatic as Tonto. He played the role with a complete freaky and creepy style with humorous touch that brought this film to a whole new level. You could watch the whole film just to watch Tonto and if you are familiar with Johnny Depp's exceptional style you'll be amazed. Sometimes, I found a slight reflection of Jack Sparrow in Tonto, but come on, both of them are crazy, mysterious and yet to be the perfect symbol of many people's hidden desire!A well-made and a very entertaining film. What else do we need?Just another thing. Aarmie was selected to play ""Bruce Wayne"" for a ""Justice League"" movie that was never made. I think he would be perfect and we could expect something exceptional from him, maybe something more satisfying to the comic book fans. At least, he could do better than whatever trash Keaon, Kilmar and Clooney did with the role.",The Lone Ranger

I read critics review to see what they think, but generally discard them, though I did lower my hopes. The movie was a little 'worse' than expected before I read the reviews. The movie is a great summer popcorn flick though. Lots of action, adventure and trains from beginning to end; the movie rarely slows down. Lots of 'over-the-top' scenes, but then again this is a Hollywood movie and not real life. And that's what I like about it! It's just fun entertainment that you don't have to think about. The Lone Ranger and Tonto have good chemistry on screen and that helps with the fun. There are a few scenes that are not too fun and may not be suitable for children and I guess that is where the movie falls off the tracks. It would have been nice to make it a little more kid-friendly (especially if they planned to make toys to sell).

I remember back in 2005 the starting reviews on wedding crashers were about 5/10 and that movie is a comedy classic by now.I recommend you watch the movie and judge for yourself.

601,jimbo87400,Puzzlingly underrated movie,8,15 January 2014,"I had not gone to the theater to see this movie merely because of all the bad press it was getting. I considered the ""intelligentsia mob"" to be of some valid standing and heeded their warnings. It wasn't until reading the movie entry found on Wikipedia where I read a quote by Quentin Tarantino stating it to be one of 2013's best. Due to my respect for him, I bought the blu-ray and have to say that I agree with him completely. I honestly do not know what basis the critics were rating this movie on. Even the middle segment that Tarantino thought was slow kept my interest throughout. The only negative attribute I can think of was that it's yet another Disney film trying to find that next ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. If you put that stereotype aside, I thought the film was highly enjoyable, fun and well acted by all involved. Even the length of the film didn't bother me. I thought Depp and Hammer had great chemistry on screen, the action sequences were pure fun and you really loved to hate the villains. Perhaps I'm just a big fan of Depp or high adventure films, whether it be western or other. I really did enjoy this film in where I can safely say that I have absolutely no idea why so many critics could hate it so. As Tarantino said, ""When I saw it, I kept thinking, 'What, that's the film that everybody says is crap? Seriously?'""",The Lone Ranger
602,rllibert,Good Good-Guys,8,24 January 2021,"Ignore critics. This is a fun western. I think critics' major issue with this movie (though they wouldn't admit it) is that the John Reid is a genuine good guy.

This certainly isn't fare. before the release everyone somehow expected this movie to be Pirate 5 and everyone comparing it with pirates! this is wrong. this movie is different in many aspects. that's why after watching this movie, many got angry and immediately rated 1 for the movie!!!! i think by a justly judgment, this movie deserve a score between 7.5 and 8. I really liked the action sequences which was so exciting in conjunction with comedy. I think the only defect of the movie was in scenario. the ranger, who was a lawyer and hadn't draw or even touched gun for many years, immediately became a professional fighter and shooter which I don't think to be logic.",The Lone Ranger
608,journeygod,The Lone Ranger Firing Blanks???,4,12 July 2013,"Not to discount anyone's opinion, but I write scripts, so I know a little of what I speak. 1. Johnny Depp's costume didn't kill The Lone Ranger, (quite frankly, I found it somewhat refreshing) 2. Neither did Armie Hammer, (though they could've hired better. Kevin Costner maybe??) What killed this movie was too many plot lines that were never fully developed. Generally, a script is composed of 3 acts; one-30 mins., two-1 hour., three-30 mins. This movie died in the second act with the creation of unnecessary plot lines, many of which failed to develop into anything significant. Spoiler Alert: When Butch Cavendish ate the Texas Ranger's heart (good start btw), that CLEARLY needed to be developed. Heck, the woman we met in the second act was missing a leg from a guy who apparently ate it!!! THINGS LIKE THIS NEED TO BE EXPLAINED, cause when a guy robs a 7-eleven with a .38 special, I can accept, the explanation, 'He's just a bad guy' but when he climbs on the roof of a university with a high-powered rifle, it needs a deeper explanation than just, 'Hey I'm a bad dude'.Tonto's belief that silver was the only instrument that could kill a Wendigo worked nicely to explain the Lone Ranger's penchant for silver bullets. However, the whole plot with mining silver and taking over a railroad was clearly unnecessary. Generally speaking, if somebody burns your Indian village to ashes and then proceeds to ambush another guy and eat his brother's heart, that's usually enough to inspire a 2-hour chase throughout the Old West.

It takes him the whole movie to become a horse riding, gun strapping hero but it's all worth it in the end, which is why the story is so fun. Yes, lots of Computer and digital effects, funny slapstick (bring in Depp) and you have a fun ride the whole time. Love this movie, just love it. Let's put it this way, I would love love love them to make a sequel.The final 38 minutes contains (spoiler) the ultimate horse riding atop trains, gun shooting, saving heroines, funny Johnny Depp Tonto moments, heartwarming family (mom and son moments), bad guys threatening and shooting, oh yes. But what got me was the great use of the music, the horse (Silver, the magical crazy horse that catches girls off the side of a train), Tonto (the ultimate Johnny Depp Pirate Indian character you would ever love!), and the fast-paced back and forth gun fight, train stealing scene ever.

It is perhaps too classy of a movie for those whom sadly give it a poor review. I find it presents an involved and well told story, demonstrating the complexity of morals vs greed in the majority, in a mystic spiritual manner as is in Indian philosophy, to be the same in 1869 as today. The evolution of chemistry between Tonto and Kemo Sabie is excellent. The scenery is complex ~ which is a primary reason that I want to see it again on a big screen. I agree with a reviewer who states that in the future, the movie will be evaluated as a classic.I was surprised that I didn't ""see"" Johnny in the movie. He was so into character that I had to intentionally call to my attention that Tonto was being played by Johnny.My high opinion of Johnny the creative actor has been raised to a higher opinion of a man of values creating a quality artistic comedy adventure movie.Also note the movie is not offered in 3D... could this be because the producers are not into sucking money from the viewers?",The Lone Ranger

This is a 21st Century update, as well as a morality play. As it should, good will triumph over evil, and thankfully it does. I found it as funny as hell and the action never stopped. Sure, it's unbelievable, but it's unbelievably funny as well. I could list a ton of period inaccuracies, but that's not the point of the movie. Let me end by saying, it's sure not boring!

What was the point of making an American cowboy legend into a useless, bumbling, idiot? And Tonto deserves so much more respect than this. I am said to say that I spent money to watch this. I know that there are generations out there that will watch this and laugh and probably, one day in the future, purchase this for their DVD collections. The thought makes me sad.

The beginning is considerably good, but on the long run it ends up hogging up the merit the final scene would perspire.So finally, it's not a memorable movie, as you would expect from Disney, but it has a good solid cast and the performances are good enough to keep you on your seat, even tough you know what's going to happen next.",The Lone Ranger

There are a few famous faces and a few not so famous which gives it a balanced range of actors, adding a few twist and turns which makes it and enjoyable film to watch.

Johnny Depp is wonderful as Tonto and Archie Archer was good to look at. AS for the nay sayers this film had as many twist and turns as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Helen Bonham Carter and Tim Wilkinson gave great performances. Wooden Leg and Wooden heart included. Kudos to the Villain played by William Fichtner I particularly liked the diorama coming to life as the aged ""Tonto"" unfolded the story..... AND good triumphed over evil. Isn't that what we want when we go to see a western. A good time was had by all.",The Lone Ranger
617,sallyls,Fun and exciting,8,13 July 2013,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. It is a drama with a good story, dialog and comedic relief. Depp is brilliant, and plays well against the straight Lone Ranger character. We did not notice that it was long, although I did find the gore to be a bit much for my taste. The cinematography is excellent and the story well played. Don't be so serious--it is supposed to be entertainment! This is not the old TV series any more than the new Batman movies are like the original TV series. We laughed a lot. It was a fun movie and most people in the audience stayed for the credits and applauded at the end- so I think maybe they liked it, too. Stay for the credits :)",The Lone Ranger
618,vlstoy1-737-833385,Lone Ranger,10,8 July 2013,"We just got back from seeing this movie and I thought it was great. We thoroughly enjoyed it. It had a lot of funny moments and a lot of action. The make up was brilliant. I didn't recognize Tonto at first. The action scenes were well done and the story was laid out well. Tonto and John Reid were brilliantly played by Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer. I am a great fan of Johnny Depp so was looking forward to seeing this movie. They both did a fantastic job. I was definitely not disappointed in this movie. At first, I thought Tonto's head dress was over the top but got used to it and understood it in the end. We are old enough to remember the music from the original Lone Ranger reruns, and the William Tell Overture played at the end and during the last scenes were wonderful. We looked at each other and smiled, that was great. We are looking forward to seeing this movie again.",The Lone Ranger
619,susant_a,Brilliant Film Unfairly Panned,10,10 August 2013,"I didn't want to go to see this film because I had read all of the reviews and I didn't like what they said. My partner wanted to go though and I was dragged along reluctantly.I don't know what film the critics had seen, but it couldn't have been this one. The film was a brilliant parody of the original TV series with Jonny Depp at his comic best. The action came thick and fast throughout the film without once falling flat. OK I can understand that if the critics had expected a serious adaptation then this didn't deliver but then you only need to look at the cast to see that this was never going to be the case. Instead the film delivers action and comedy in much the same way as the Indian Jones films did.",The Lone Ranger
620,brandon-nyc10,I wanted to like it,7,18 July 2013,"I wanted to like it more than I did. Armie Hammer is beautiful, a star for the ages. A Gary Cooper old-style movie star. I would've enjoyed this film more with the sound turned off, lovely visuals in need of editing. Why is Johnny Depp in clown makeup through almost the whole thing? That really undermined his performance. I think the storytelling needed to foreground a conflict and have one central conflict, it felt a bit all over the place. Helena Bonham Carter is excellent. The set pieces (train crash, holdup) were well-done, but I think the film is too long. The framing device of the little boy at the beginning slowed the narrative drive. Not a terrible film, but would only recommend it to die-hard Depp Carter Hammer fans.",The Lone Ranger
621,kevin-kissack,Loved it to bits!,9,11 July 2013,"A refreshing change from a serious lone ranger, with many laugh out loud, some serious, and some heroic scenes. Excellent change from the usual USA saves the world stuff and has major positive angle for the ""injuns"" which is cool. Johnny Depp plays one his best roles - he really gets into the character. Brilliant! The film seemed to cameo some scenes from other classic westerns such as once upon a time in the west. Interesting and welcomed how several seasoned British actors were in this Classic Western (which Brits love!). I'm writing more stuff to make for 10 lines - the acting was top class by all. Special effects and cinematography were also top class. Story was semi-routine about the railways and how the leaders are 'bad/greedy' people: were they all really, or is that a business-person stereotype? Its one-side for the railways and defends the injuns, but as family entertainment its top shelf. Well done to Disney - at last they are making great films again! This will be a classic!",The Lone Ranger
622,deepankdude,Please avoid if you can---seriously,1,14 July 2013,"Frankly I expected it be like Cowboys & Aliens but this movie was even worse than that. The music and cast are awesome but the story along with screen play is lethargic. Frankly out of 145 min this movie could have been easily completed in 90min and those extra 55 min did the over kill. Way too weird story line, sad punch. I literally slept for 10min. The action was great and was worth the wait, the story killed everything. There was neither any mythology involved nor any sort of history, it was just a weird movie with weird plots. The twists and sparing the villain's life always was overdone and so was the obsession for law and justice. Johny Depp was as usual awesome. Please avoid if you can.",The Lone Ranger
623,dimitri-105-938631,"Very entertaining, though is Depp not very convincing as an Indian",7,24 August 2013,"The story starts with Tonto, the Indian, as an old man at a carnival, who sees his friend Kemosabe (the Lone Ranger) in a young boy in cowboy clothes. Tonto tells his unbelievable tale to the boy, which is where the story begins.What follows is an very entertaining and catching movie about Texas rangers, Indians, bad guys, greed, (quite) some violence well, you get the picture.Special effects can be either badly done, well done or over-done. Badly done is when you can almost ""see the wires"". Well done is when the special effects are perfect and believable. Over done is like Mission Impossible overdone: over the top, forgetting about the laws of physics and reality.The special effects in The Lone Ranger are between well-done and a bit towards over the top, but actually, in this case, this is a good thing. In the scene where two trains race each other, the over-the-top special effects are geniously mixed with humor, which makes it all very entertaining.Although I generally love Johnny Depp's movies and characters, I think he doesn't really convince me as a (Comanche) Indian (sorry, Native American, which is of course the better term). He's just, well, too Johnny Depp and doesn't have the appearance of a Native American. It would be like having Robert Downey Jr perform as a black guy. Oh wait, actually, pulled that off very well in Tropic Thunder! :) ll in all, I loved the movie. Go see it.",The Lone Ranger

It's terribly unfortunate it bombed by box office standards.My dislikes are the fact that it's a flashback and it was a bit long. The nature of flashbacks always bother me because the one person doesn't know all of the story being told and those segments stretched the movie out...but, in every movie you have to overlook something that doesn't completely iron out.If you weren't one of the 8 million people who watched this film, rent it. It's worth the watch and better than a whole lot of other crap Hollywood pushes out the door.",The Lone Ranger
625,sadler0104,Loved this movie,10,6 July 2013,"My husband and I just saw ""The Lone Ranger"" and we absolutely loved it. This is great summer escapist entertainment. Beautifully filmed, gorgeous locations, terrific music, excellent cast. A couple of plot points could have been eliminated, but there was a really good story here with a nice little twist. I see a lot of movies, my husband - hardly any. He's very selective about the movies he'll see in a theater. I'd shared with him the reviews on ""The Lone Ranger"" and then he sat through previews for upcoming films like ""Thor: The Dark World"", ""Wolverine"", ""R.I.P.D"". He was rethinking ever seeing a movie again. After the film, I was totally surprised to hear him declare that he LOVED ""The Lone Ranger"" and most importantly, had a really good time watching it. He was actually angry with the critics for dissing this movie. Ignore the critics. Have a good time and enjoy this terrific summer movie.",The Lone Ranger
626,smys,I was contemplating suicide halfway through the movie,1,5 July 2013,"What a piece of garbage! A perfect example of how Hollywood can waste 50 million dollars. Even Johnny Depp couldn't salvage this catastrophe. As a matter of fact, he was pretty bad himself. It seems as though after 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies every time you put the guy in long haired wig he snaps into Jacks Sparrow mode.I found the characters incredibly annoying, especially Rebecca and Danny. When they got kidnapped, I found myself actually hoping they would get shot, thinking maybe, JUST MAYBE, the movie would improve. Price paid: $10.75 for ticket, $11 for popcorn and a drink & over two hours of my youth wasted on a sh*t movie without so much as a nice face to look at; seeing as Johnny Depp was covered in a mask of black and white makeup through out the entire movie. In summary I regret not having stayed home and watched the first part of Pirates of the Caribbean, at least that movie was funny. Save your money or watch This is the End instead.",The Lone Ranger

This movie is like the rich guy who drives a Jaguar but who annoys the living daylights out of you because he talks too much.It's pretty easy: good guys should be the ones you route for. Not this movie. I wouldn't have minded if someone had capped the Lone Ranger just to stop the whining.It had some good moments...The gorgeous set of Red's bordello was an incredible orgy for the eyes.

628,pagrsm,Hi Ho silver,10,17 July 2013,"I loved this movie. I think in order to understand and get into it you had to have been a child of the 50's, watching this on TV on a regular basis. This movie does all the stunts, riding the horse on top of the train etc and also makes Tonto into a great lead character. Depp is outstanding in this role. I think all the professional reviewers do not understand this genre of film. Watch this if you like Johnny Depp. The Lone Ranger is a reluctant hero in this. This is good. It shows that seeking good is not a crusade but a response to situations. The Lone Ranger does not kill, is not a vigilante and doesn't always know what to do. There is an attempt to make e the two main women characters strong and not shrieking violets. I wish they had been given a little more lines and action. The Indians were not super heroes and the scenes with the army were strong and showed the poor way that the native Americans were treated without being a diatribe. You got the message. I laughed and even sat on the edge of my seat. And the William Tell overture during the final scenes was wonderful.",The Lone Ranger
629,jamie-owers,Not nearly as bad as you've heard,8,25 August 2013,"From the first trailer, I had been interested in this movie. I really enjoyed the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean film"", and found the others fine enough, so knowing this was from the same team, including Director Gore Verbinski, I had rather high hopes. The trailers presented a sense of adventure with great action set pieces, and a seeming level of grit. Upon the film's release, I was disappointed to hear a slew of terrible reviews panning it. Now, I usually try to tell myself not to listen to the critics' reviews, and judge the film for myself, but I usually can't help it, and unfortunately this often affects my expectations going into the movie. Having listened to the reviews, my expectations were blown out of the water.This film is nowhere NEAR as bad as it is made out to be. The stars, Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp have since come out and said that the film was judged from the start, and I agree with them. Sure, it's no cinema master-piece, but it's a really fun adventure filled movie. At times you can really feel the film's length, there could have easily been at least 20 minutes taken off the run time. There were also a few moments that felt unnecessary and didn't add much to the experience, but these did little to bring down the movies entertainment valueI might be mentioning the critics a little too often, but it's hard not to when they seem to be so instrumental in this films image. Another feature criticized was the chemistry between The titular Lone Ranger and Tonto. I felt both their performances were great, even if Johnny Depp's Tonto was slightly Jack Sparrow-esque. I can see where the critics are coming from, as this is an origin story, it does take a while before the Lone Ranger and Tonto are working together, but I felt that when they finally form a team, things really worked out.In conclusion, The Lone Ranger isn't Citizen Kane. But guess what, it's not meant to be. It shouldn't be viewed in such a harsh light. In the end, it's a well directed, action-packed, slightly long adventure with a few good laughs thrown it. It's also quite visually stunning. If you take it for what it is, sit back and just enjoy the ride, you might be surprised. You could enjoy ""The Lone Ranger"" as much as I did.",The Lone Ranger

I have already seen it three times and it brings a smile on my face every time and I love it. The story, the effects, and the scenery are excellent. The main actors do their own stunts excellently. I love Armie Hammer as The Lone Ranger and Johnny Depp as Tonto. They are great actors and good staring together on screen. I would love to see more of The Lone Ranger in squeals, but I am sad to see that might not happen because the movie has not done well in the theater,(which I still do not understand why it is not doing well). After watching so many interviews I saw just how much real blood, sweat, and tears where put into making this movie. This movie was not easy to make and they worked very hard to make it through many obstacles for almost an entire year. Which is part of the reason why I feel so sad that the movie is not getting the interest from everyone that it deserves to get. I love the The Lone Ranger it was fun and entertaining.I can't wait to own it on DVD.",The Lone Ranger
631,jason-kyle1980,Western Pirates of the Carribbean with a racist slant,6,6 July 2013,"If you liked Pirates of the Carribbean,(and The Green Hornet) you'll like this movie. If you didn't like those movies, don't watch this one. There ARE a few very funny scenes in this movie, but in my opinion, not enough to carry the movie. Johnny Depp plays the same exact character he did in Pirates, to include the same wig/over-sized bandanna from the looks of it. He acts the same (right down to being given the back history of being a bit crazy), and talks in that same, now-famous half-drunk speech pattern. What I also noticed was how racist the movie is- against whites. Now I'm not so thin-skinned that I can't take a joke now and then, but when I see a recurring theme, a very strong one at that, where the minority ""sidekick"" is blatantly leading the white main character around by the nose (Green Hornet anyone?)and in this case a CRAZY minority (played ironically by a white guy)is still more clued in than the idiot white ""hero"" Lone Ranger is supposed to be... it starts to get on my nerves. Seriously, if the movie had made Tonto look as inept and clueless as they did Lone Ranger, Native Americans everywhere would be tearing Hollywood a new one. Same with Green Hornet. But because the movie is making fun of the white guy, I guess that makes racism okay...",The Lone Ranger
632,victoriahicks92,Was Better Than I Expected...,7,15 October 2013,"When I first heard the news of a Lone Ranger film with Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, I was a bit skeptical. I love both actors, but I wasn't sure how Johnny Depp was going to do portraying Tonto, a Native American. So when the film was out, I choice another over it (Grown Ups 2), but after recently watching the film last night, I really wish my friends and I had saw it in theaters instead!It was entertaining, yet contained plenty of action of course. They kept true to the Lone Ranger phrases, costume, and music, which I found very interesting. Johhny Depp was amazing! I have no clue why I doubted this amazing man! His portrayal of Tonto definitely wasn't cheesy or unrealistic for me, he definitely did his homework. Armie Hammer did a nice job with his character's arc. He really took on the role of the Lone Ranger. :)As for the editing, I loved how during the final showdown, the action was edited to the Lone Ranger movie! So I recommend you watch this movie!

This film is outstanding; so much fun. 2 1/5 hours flew by and left me wanting more. All the characters were outstanding. Esp love Depp, Hammer, and Fichtner - his bad guy character is AWESOME! People's biggest complaints seem to be 1) that it's too long and 2) lackluster plot. Neither of these was the case for me, or my mom. My mom watched The Lone Ranger as a kid, and she said Hammer's character was very similar in his mannerisms and speech. Only question my mom had was why nobody at the end said ""Who was that?"" and someone else is is supposed to say ""The Lone Ranger,"" but it was fantastic. No complaints here.",The Lone Ranger
634,Toshali,Worth the wait,8,5 July 2013,"I was a little disappointed about the critics' review of the movie, since I adore Johnny Depp and had been waiting for the movie to release for months. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was lovely. It had action (as promised), a good plot and pretty generous doses of humor for a movie of this genre. Depp stole the show with his portrayal of Tonto, but the other actors were great as well. The obvious comparison of this movie is with the Pirates of the Caribbean series because of Verbinski and Depp. There were parts of the movie, especially those where Tonto's actions generated laughs from the theater, which reminded me of the latter. Both have Depp in eccentric roles which provide ample comic relief. But since the themes are completely different, I feel that a comparison is not exactly fair. All in all, it is a good, lighthearted, entertaining way to spend two and a half hours, and I am considering hitting the theater for it again soon.",The Lone Ranger

The entire cast are excellent with the villains, very bad indeed. With brilliant Screenplay, Production and Direction, with most of the film being shot in Utah, the film moved at a cracking pace, I was thoroughly entertained over the 2 hours and twenty minutes of this film.I cannot believe this film flopped so badly, the music and special effects were among some of the best ever.

636,timofeo-408-296942,Great Classic Action Comedy Western,6,31 July 2013,"This movie suffered from poor ratings from all sorts of critics and I would like to first note that I feel these are perhaps the reasons of why critics would dislike it.+ The Trailer to me implies a slightly more serious tone for the movie then was actually had.+ The Lone Ranger is less a Strongman Hero and more a Hero of the Moment+ Unrealistic action scenes similar to Pirates of the Caribbean+ Has a semi liberal agenda (Christians are sort of denoted as bad people, but there are of course goods and bads of any group however this may have been a complaint as I noticed 2 bad guys mention god and or pray and there is a band of Christians that do something mean.)This movie is very entertaining it is less a standard western and more a Shangai Noon type of Western (if you have seen that) then anything else. It has as many laughs as punches and this is certainly not a bad thing. This movie is not meant to be serious is meant to be an enjoyable watch. When watching a movie I think the most important parts are how you feel,+ Are you invested in the characters? Yes there is excellent character development and back story for every main character and even the secondary cast for the most part.+ Is the cinematography good without trying to hard to show you beautiful landscapes for the sake of it which so many movies try and do.+ Does the movie have any GLARING plot holes, sure there may be plot holes I have no clue the movie was to enjoyable to care but none were obvious or interrupted my experience to give you an example of a movie with bad plot holes would be Batman The Dark Knight Rises which has many (but does have good cinematography without it being to much to give another example.)Now while this movie did have some flaws what movie doesn't it is extremely sad to see it fail so badly to make money and to get good reviews when it surely was not that bad It is on the same tier of movies such asShanghai Noon (I could say similar to most Jackie Chan movies to be honest) Pirates of the Caribbean (without as grand a story perhaps) City Slickers etc The group of your Classic Movies basically definitely a movie I will purchase just for the sake of telling Disney this is a good example of a movie.",The Lone Ranger
637,jordan-460-960564,Disney's Flawed Yet Fun Outing to the South,7,23 December 2013,"I'd like to start by saying that the critics have been unfairly harsh on this flick. There's a lot to like about it that has been totally omitted from most of the reviews I've read so far.Johnny Depp played his part well (as he should - he's been playing the same part for years) and William Fichtner played a great bad-guy. The humour was tasteful enough for an older audience but also simple enough for kids to enjoy too. The action works in the same way; nothing too gory for the young ones but enough is included to make it effective to everyone. Finding this balance so that the movie appeals to everyone is something the creators have done well.However, I have a number of complaints too. First of all, the cheese. Oh dear lord is it cheesy. The last 20 minutes left a bad taste in my mouth if I'm honest; I'd put it down to bad writing and poor direction more than anything else. Also, Helena Bonham Carter's name has been absolutely abused for this movie. Her role was minuscule and there is no clear reason as to why her character was part of the movie at all. Finally, although a minor quibble, the way that the story is told, through the memories of Depp's character, tears the story apart at the seams with plot holes. How can he recall things that neither he nor John Reid were present at? Poor writing.There's a lot to like about The Lone Ranger, a lot more than the critics want you to think, but there are quite a few flaws too. This movie passes the time well, and all in all you won't mind passing two hours with this movie.",The Lone Ranger

639,nhengstebeck,A solid summer popcorn film,5,9 July 2013,"This film is best enjoyed with a bag of popcorn and an empty bladder. ""The Lone Ranger"" contains all of the excitement and spirit of its kindred ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" franchise and sticks to that identity. And I say kindred, because it is exactly that. A lot of people I have seen reviewing the film complain it is too similar to the ""Pirates"" franchise. This is both a blessing and a curse for this film. It is great because it contains the same exciting, yet playful spirit of ""Pirates"", bringing new life to a beloved hero from the radio and early TV days. Unfortunately, by riding (no pun intended) on the success horse that is the ""Pirates"" franchise, the film was condemned to the disappointment of the audience when they did not get ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". I would wager that if the common viewer had not been told who this film was made by in the trailer, they would have been a lot more welcoming to the film.I had a great time watching the film and did not get bored.... Was I frustrated at several elements? Yes. here is a cut and dry list of my grievances. 1) Poor Character Development. 2) Microscopic love development 3) wasting half the film chasing the wrong villain 3.5) too many villains 4) Using a magic horse as a lifesaver when the film stalls. (note. I have a feeling this may have been a motif from the early ""Lone Ranger"" days. However, I am not familiar with the old stories so I cannot say for sure.) 5) a main character whose perception of himself changes almost as many times as mine did for him. 6) No real ""message"" 7) seriously, I don't understand why those two are in love....Frustrated, yes. Bored?

Many lines of dialogue are laughably bad and the delivery just as worse ""I can't miss, I am a spirit walker!"" Ugh. A good movie often shows something to the audience rather than explain it with dialogue, and the lone ranger has a lot of unnecessary explanation. I felt there wasn't much chemistry between the actors and many of the roles were severely underdeveloped. There are also two child actors who were not great either. The majority of the story is a very played out buddy western with all of the tropes. Tries to be funny, and has a few good lines but more fail.

I thought this film was very good -- far better than I had expected from reading all the criticism from the film critics and some of the comments from viewers. Did they just miss the point entirely? Listen, it's not that complicated. This movie just takes the old Lone Ranger classics (radio and TV serial) and has fun with re-booting that story. It's Tonto who is the one telling the story this time and the Lone Ranger who's the straight man -- and this actually works (in my opinion). After all, this is really a re-boot -- a ""how the Lone Ranger became the classic hero"" story -- and having Tonto tell the story is a brilliant move to change the straight-laced Lone Ranger as infallible Western superhero into a believable character for a more modern audience. John Reid, the guy who's eventually going to become the Lone Ranger, starts out as a straight-laced stiff who takes himself and his beliefs far too seriously. Tonto clearly thinks he's pretty useless -- and that's a funny premise to begin with. Armie Hammer is perfectly credible as John Reid -- he's plays fish out of water in the bad old West, but slowly (with Tonto's help) he starts to learn what he needs to learn to be effective in putting a halt to the evil done by the bad guys.Tonto is a great role for Johnny Depp. It's his deadpan humor that provides the story's most lively commentary on how the Lone Ranger is progressing in learning his craft. I think many people were startled by Johnny Depp's costume -- but go look up Kirby Statler's ""I am Crow"" picture on Google images. There is an historical basis for how Johnny Depp decided to dress as Tonto. Besides, historically speaking, it was less likely that an Indian living in the canyons area of west Texas would be an Apache -- which is the closest native costume to how Jay Silverheels (the TV serial's Tonto) dressed -- than it would be for the Indian to be a Comanche. I've lived in Texas for decades and actually studied Texas (and Comanche) history enough so that I have no problem with Johnny Depp's outfit -- and the crow on his head actually ends up involved in some pretty funny bits in the movie! They actually were pretty clever in how they did this.The point of the picture is both the individual journey that John Reid makes to become the Lone Ranger (earning Tonto's friendship and respect along the way) and the overall nature of the forces arrayed against them. During the course of the film, the whole picture slowly becomes clear about what the bad guys are up to and who is helping them and why ... and the climax of the film (the last 20 minutes or so) is just a spectacular action sequence. Here, the Lone Ranger is finally the hero we remember -- and so it's fitting that when we hear the William Tell overture cut in, it's funny but also it finally fits! The final battle is very very well done. It's a very complicated sequence, with lots of different participants, but Verbinski does a great job of helping the audience keep track of who's who and what's going on. It works! Finally, I think some people had a problem with the ""frame story."" I didn't. I totally thought that worked. If Tonto is telling the tale -- the myth of the old West, the myth of the Lone Ranger -- to a kid, then that leaves us, the audience, to decide what parts of the story are embellished for mythmaking and storytelling and what parts are the parts that a younger Tonto actually experienced. I think that's brilliant, actually. How else, other than through this kind of mythic lens, could you tell such a classic hero tale to a modern audience? By the way, about some of the earlier reviews that mentioned a bloody scene involving the bad guy actually eating a heart ... the theatrical release we saw today did not have this as an explicit action scene. That is, you hear the bad guy say he's going to do it, and he apparently does do it, but you do not specifically see the bloody gory deed. I assume that (maybe just for American audiences) they edited that down to be more suggestive than completely depicted. I would say that this is a movie that kids (down to the age of 8, say) could tolerate without major trauma.HINT: There IS a final bit over the last part of the credits that I think answers some of the questions about whether Tonto is who he says (to the kid) that he is.",The Lone Ranger

Johnny Depp plays a witty Indian (somewhat similar to jack sparrow in his wits), Armie Hammer is good as the lone ranger... but, no one could have played TONTO's character as good as Johnny Depp. This movie is AWESOME!",The Lone Ranger

The kind of movie that at the end, everyone in the theater applauds and cheers! Johnny Depp cast as Tonto was Genius! Johnny and Armie Hammer are fantastic together. There are laughs all the way through to the very end. I believe they have hit the Jackpot on this one!! The casting for this movie was perfect. The writing was incredible! Johnny being Johnny with his ad-libs throughout was fantastic! There were plenty of stunts making it an action packed flick. I can't wait for this to hit video so I can see it again and again. This was such a great movie, I can only hope for a sequel!!!",The Lone Ranger

It was long and entertaining. 2:30 long to be exact. The usual expected from Johnny Depp, quirky, awkward, funny. His character played a very important role in the movie. It almost seemed it should be called Tonto and the lone ranger since we see more of Tonto through out the whole movie. The same usual awkwardness (moves, antics, facial expressions) as jack sparrow, but with a painted face. Literally just like jack sparrow.Lone ranger offered a very interesting character in the movie, but somehow did not commit fully to the role. There was something missing from Arm & Hammer. The movie played well as a revenge western. It had a lot of good action scenes in it, gory for kids though. As It was Disney CA you saw a lot of parents take their little ones and realized it was too violent for them. But I guess they watch more violent TV at home. I personally would not take kids younger than 13 to this movie because of the violence and gore. Parents think twice before you take your kids to this, more violent than pirates.",The Lone Ranger

From the previews I had seen, I wasn't going to spend money on this. So Time Warner offers me two free tickets, I invite a friend and we go and watch this. I was presently surprised after watching this. I remember some of the Lone Ranger comics and remember seeing small clips and my dad telling me stories about it but I never actually saw a show. I enjoyed this movie, it reminded me of fun action with the family. The violence wasn't ridiculous where you couldn't bring children to watch it but authentic enough to know not to try it at home. I saw in an interview that Armie did all the stunts and you can tell. His work on making the character honorable, noble and pretty much a decent human being was very well portrayed. Johnny Depp steals the show with his one liners, a few times I just started laughing at the comments he would make. Overall i'd give this movie an 8/10. Well written, excellent character development, you actually care for them and a great job with the actors and the acting. What I really enjoyed about the movie was that the special effects didn't look too fake. Yeah a few scenes you may have been like yeah right in your head but unlike Fast and the Furious 6, the special effects people on this project do a great job keeping it looking realistic. Bring your family to watch this, a great story of an iconic character. Hopefully this is the start to more because I wouldn't mind watching a sequel or two.",The Lone Ranger
649,philsammarco-724-572843,Pirates in the Wild West - Is this the Best They Can Do?,6,28 June 2013,"The Lone Ranger is a long movie with some humor, some drama and unrestrained action that runs right off the rails. The pun is intended. None of these elements while perhaps balanced bring enough to make this a great picture. Johnny Depp does his best with a character who seems to have had the potential in the script room to be more interesting. Armie Hammer does not bring the on-screen gravitas to pull off the lead hero. A stronger, more charismatic actor might have drawn people to the hero and pulled his weight along side Johnny Depp. Now Silver put in a strong supporting performance that is sure to be overlooked come Oscar time.As many a movie that runs long and falls short, The Lone Ranger could benefit from some basic editing. There is a storytelling tool involving a small boy that does very little to add to the entertainment and advance the story. Perhaps the boy is there to hammer home the target audience is your children. Additionally, I lost track of how many times the heroes are captured and escape and visa versa how many times the villain is captured and escapes. It kind of goes round and round like that which might appeal to younger audiences, but that leads to another issue.If you are marketing this movie to truly younger audiences with toys*, games and possibly an amusement ride, the on-screen violence is quite constant, graphic and dark. And basically, the film is just not that fun.It seems obvious that this movie was reverse engineered. Hey, let's get the Pirates of the Caribbean gang together (Depp, Verbinski, writers, etc) and build a Disney blockbuster! Okay, now let's develop a concept. I expect due to the Disney marketing machine the film will meet with some box office success, but it will be panned by critics (and many adults). Based on what I saw, I am not sure The Lone Ranger has legs as a franchise.* Seriously, Lone Ranger Lego blocks are ages 8-14? What were you doing when you were 14?",The Lone Ranger

Bad western , bad comedy and a real flop. But thats probably the norm for Disney Films. At least The Lone Ranger wasn't a homosexual. It sure was a disappointment to see Tonto made up in war paint the whole movie. I watched the TV series as a child and enjoyed the episodes that I was able to see. The combination of inaccuraseies and none historical events made the film seem more of a spuff than was probably intended . Johnny Depps carracter was really stupid. A poor attempt at humor.

You can just tell that this was as much of a fun ride making it as it is watching it. Johnny Depp steals it when he is on, you just are mesmerized by what might he do next. Its the subtleties that he adds that really makes him so good and fun to watch. Johnny and Armie play well off each other. Don't let the so called ""professional ""critics"" make your choices.

One of the points the movie makes, by showing us machine guns - arguably the first arms of mass destruction - being used against bow and arrows is the inequality in technology. This inequality is one of the big problems of our times, because it allows bully nations to beat and rob weaker ones.",The Lone Ranger

The story is ridiculous and as far as a fun adventure, I find it disturbing that comic relief follows the slaughter of 5,000 Comanche AFTER it was established that they didn't break the treaty. Why would we kill off thousands in a family comedy? This was an opportunity to introduce a new generation to The Lone Ranger, who stood for righting wrongs in a lawless world. The storyline had the potential for a great movie but the director got carried away once again and God knows what happened to the original script.Very poorly done with Depp in his usual over the top performance. Stay away.",The Lone Ranger
655,ghostchaser8,Good money well spent,7,4 July 2013,"OK, I went to see Lone Ranger on July 4th due to the un-ending rain that was hitting Northern Georgia at the time. I normally don't go to see movies and pay full price (we have a dollar theater not far from here), because usually movies produced today don't warrant paying $8 - $12 or more for a ticket. Anyway, my wife gave me a choice of either the new Sandra Bullock movie or The Lone Ranger, and I told her that many movies don't translate well to a smaller television screen - my way of getting out of seeing another stupid Bullock pic. I must say that the $21 spent on a few tickets the day after opening, was well spent. Depp stole the show. His portrayal of Tonto was very well done. I don't believe it was ""over the top"", as many might say, he played it well, and I feel that the part was written for him. William Fichtner who plays Butch Cavendish, does an excellent job, and the make-up throughout the film was extraordinary. The action was well balanced, and the CGI Effects complimented the action well. Overall, I would say the hard earned money I forked over for tickets was well spent, and I firmly believe that this will be a top money grosser for the 2013 Summer season. Do yourself a favor and see The Lone Ranger on the big screen - don't wait for the DVD version to see it first. Buy the DVD for the behind the scenes footage - that would be most interesting indeed.",The Lone Ranger

I don't usually read reviews before I go to see a movie anyway. I truly enjoyed watching it. The cinematography and the action sequences were wonderful. I thought the acting was very good too. The moment the movie started I knew it was going to be great. It didn't feel long at all for me and the 2 1/2 hours went by really quickly and I didn't even feel it. That's how fast pace this movie is. I like the story telling method that the director use to tell the story of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. I thought the make up was amazing too. I think everyone on this movie did a great job. Again, love the shots. There are many beautiful shots in this movie! Overall this is a very entertaining movie.

Although the movie was a little too long for my eight year old, it was cute, action-packed, humorous, & the characters made you want to shout out for them! I would highly recommend this movie for the entire family. The casting of this movie is wonderful, too. It was neat to see such a diverse group of actors & actresses in such an intense movie! While some obviously negative people claim that Johnny Depp was extremely similar to his Jack Sparrow character in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, they obviously only looked at the similar long hair of the two characters artistically portrayed by Johnny Depp. These two characters are completely different: one speaks as a Native American, whereas the other has a European, drunken accent. I personally found Johnny Depp to be a great Tonto & Hammer is an absolutely endearing Lone Ranger! : D",The Lone Ranger
658,Best-Street,Ranger and Tonto,8,5 July 2013,"This film I'm waiting, and I was sure that it will be great because it worked on the famous trio Depp - Verbinski - Bruckheimer, who created the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", which has already become a cult picture. Bring these guys could not. Now, go to the cinema and watch a movie, I can say that my expectations were justified to some extent, but still, I thought I would see a different movie.The fact that the film, except that resembles the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but in the Wild West, and still produces a lot of things that I absolutely did not expect to see here. Pretty tough moments, not in the Disney style, ranging from cannibalism and ending too harshly shown a scene of destruction Indian tribe. But the pluses in the film so much more.Directed by Gore Verbinski takes an interesting and rather risky project. The film came out great, sometimes very funny, but still the director has not moved away from the ""Pirates"", but there is nothing wrong with that. Cinema beautiful, the atmosphere of the Wild West is well maintained, looked all very wonderful. But I still think that Gore is to change the style a bit and take something else, and that each picture will be comparing it with the ""Pirates"", especially if there will be present Depp. The story here is quite good, but sometimes slack, some things out of place, and some will be long remembered. The jokes were good and there were enough, laughed all over every room. Pleased music, Hans Zimmer, master of his craft. The special effects are impressive, the picture is very beautiful. The chase on the trains, jumping from one train to another, shooting, fighting, everything here is made at the highest level. Pleasing views of the Old West - the mountains, the desert, the old small towns, it's all very evokes the atmosphere of those times. Starring Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp. Both look good, especially Depp. His character - the Indian Tonto could very please throughout the film. There are similarities with Jack Sparrow, but do not dwell on this. Like his style - painted face, a dead crow on his head. In general, Depp played his role perfectly, the character came out pretty interesting. By Armie Hammer about to say that it was good, and even though he is the main character, a picture still drags on itself Depp. William Fichtner in the form of cruel villain looked confident and played it perfectly. Ruth Wilson, who is familiar to me in the TV series ""Luther"" wins back well. Tom Wilkinson also showed their best fulfilling its role well. And Helena Bonham Carter was a great decoration film. ""The Lone Ranger"" - a fun, bright, exciting and quite spectacular western adventure, which may well entertain the audience and cheer up. The actors are excellent, Depp and Hammer regains good. Directing magnificent, Verbinski tries as you can. The special effects are beautiful, very dynamic action scenes are present. True story a little pumped up. But still, I think it has everything you need for a really good and exciting blockbuster. I liked the movie, I recommend to view.",The Lone Ranger
659,triplejrusty,A Total Disgrace,1,5 July 2013,"In trying to be objective and hoping the movie would get better as it progressed, I was horribly disappointed. It was nothing but another Hollywood version of trying to be cute with a legendary story. This was not only a total waste of money, it will go down as one of the worst films ever. I don't know whose writing the positive reviews but I can only figure that it is the relatives of the Hollywood actors portrayed in this very disappointing movie.

Knowing who the Lone Ranger is or having watched him as a child is not pertinent in watching this film. I don't recommend it for small children as there are some bloody moments.

If you watched the Lone Ranger as a kid you will be disappointed by the way the character is portrayed here.

This movie went out of its way to beat you over the head with anti-American propaganda, so much so that it actually got in the way of the story.

It was also kinda nonsensical, unrealistic, predictable, and forgettable, too. I don't at all mind a movie being two and a half hours, but this one did not need to be; it was much longer than it did since the characters were undeveloped, weak, and kinda cliché, especially the villains. They also didn't really have any personality. Also, at certain points throughout (it's at the beginning, too), it cuts back to an older Tonto telling the story about how him and the Lone Ranger/John Reid met to a younger boy (by the way, where in the world were his parents and all that stuff?), which I thought was unnecessary and wasn't beneficial. There are more flaws, but I don't feel like stating them because I'm kinda lazy in some ways. Overall, I thought it was, while bland and unmemorable, okay.",The Lone Ranger

Progress in the name of greed.As a white man I am tinged with sadness every time I see stories of Native American butchery. I wonder over the use of the name Tonto which in Spanish means foolish dumb one. Again the original writer chose a name that further denigrated Native Americans.According to Professor Green, the Transcontinental Railroad was a financial mess to about a tune of $70 to $100 million in every single RR company of the time declaring BK, and all those bonds failing.

What ever happened to people enjoying movies that have a good story and take you on a fun ride? It seems like these days if a movie isn't filled with a massive amount of effects or isn't soul-wrenching no one likes it. I am not particularly a Depp fan, or a Lone Ranger or western fan, but I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, we may go see it again before it leaves the big screen. It had an actual story, a little history, some special effects, some scenes that stir your emotions, a wee bit of the supernatural and a funny horse.

Not historically accurate: this is a work of fiction based on fiction. The old west is depicted as gritty, racist, narrow minded, greedy, stupid, violent, tough, colorful, optimistic, dangerous and on the brink of industrialization. Sounds like the history I was taught. 2. Reid and Tonto have a terrible relationship: they grow together as partners through the course of the film. They are funny together. The humor is not misplaced. Shakespeare did it in Hamlet and other plays. It is entertainment. D and H play very well together. 3. Depp does Jack Sparrow: this is ridiculous. Jack Sparrow is sexy. Tonto is patently not. He is a unique character with a troubled and lonely past. I was never reminded of the pirate once. 4. Too violent: this is a PG 13 movie. That demographic loves violence, action and gross out sequences. They would love the heart scene - where the violence was off screen, manure, cannibal rabbits, dead men and graves. Nothing compared to R violence. Wonderful elements were the spectacular scenery. Monument Valley hasn't looked so good since The Searchers. The music was thrilling and used to heighten the emotional impact. I wanted to stand up and cheer when the Rossini started. Please,see this movie so there will be more made.

It was not only poignant, but beautifully mastered. Though the film is tanking (financially), it should merit a nomination for Visual Effects or Cinematography. It is truly living art. Yes, some of the facts are incorrect (there were 50 stars on the flags...), but look past it. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and if you can manage to drag yourself to a theater, despite the bad reviews, I think you will too!! P.S. The love interest is almost as breathtaking in this as Helena is quirky fun.",The Lone Ranger
673,jcplaistowe,The original Lone Ranger must wish they left this alone.,5,7 July 2013,"The characters are cartoon like and have no depth. The Jack Sparrow influenced Tonto, played by Johnny Depp does not portray a noble American Indian acting as narrator. The movie tries to mix humor and action while supposedly honoring a well known series from the 50's, achieving none of these in the process. Armie Hammer portrays the Lone Ranger as mentally slow and lacking in emotion. The action scenes are entertaining and Helena B. Carter is a refreshing break from the other characters in the movie playing Red a local saloon owner. A remake of the Lone Ranger is still a good idea it just needs a whole different approach.",The Lone Ranger
674,CapDynamite,GREAT MOVIE!! Well worth seeing!!,10,8 July 2013,"Practically everyone on this site has voiced their opinions about how bad this movie is at great length. What I do find hilarious is the amount of people ""bashing"" this fine film and ""claiming"" to have seen it. If everyone on this site who was ""bashing"" this film actually went out and saw the movie, then I don't believe for a second that it would have done so poorly at the box office.I believe that for some sad evil reason, people want to attack Depp and Disney. And by the result of the massive amount of ""fake"" negative reviews, they actually won. The haters actually won by swaying the reviews poll and misleading the public into not going to see the Lone Ranger. How very sad. Very sad indeed.The LONE RANGER is a great movie. There are plenty of other positive reviews on here that give great descriptions for reasons to go see this movie. I, on the other, hand will give more of a movie comparison for people to judge against.IF you are someone who liked: The MASK OF ZORRO, PIRATES OF THE Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, PRICE OF PERSIA, or The THREE MUSKETEERS, then I believe the LONE RANGER is a movie you will enjoy.While the LONE RANGER may well indeed fail financially at the BOX OFFICE, it did not fail at being a great entertaining adventure movie. I look forward to owning it on BluRay.Mr. Dynamite",The Lone Ranger

Depp and Hammer were a great team. I will add this to the list of my favorite Westerns. You feel as if you are transported back in time to the Old West with lots of unusual and interesting characters and authentic costumes. Breathtaking scenery of Arizona, N. Mexico and Utah ( they are forgiven for calling it Texas) The Indians were treated with respect, and it was a thrill to see the Lone Ranger ride again on Silver. Even the horse had a developed personality. The stunts and special effects were amazing!The critics are so wrong about this one. Maybe they just don't ""get it"".",The Lone Ranger
676,phil-732-968670,Remember this is not a documentary,10,8 July 2013,I've read the negative reviews and think to myself those folks were expecting a documentary. The legend of the Lone Ranger is one of the favorite American Myths of the baby-boomers. This movie was simply FUN. I am 62 years old. The majority of the audience appeared to be around my age and older. We grew up with this legend be it on Radio in the 30's or TV in the 50's. The audience applauded at the end of the movie in appreciation of being well entertained.,The Lone Ranger

I don't know what else anyone was expecting from the Disney movie of this type. If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean, this seems similar...action, comedy, and great scenery. It is not going to win any awards for profound meaning, but it is far from being a bad movie. It was fine. I also am not a big fan of ridiculously unrealistic CGI effects, but I thought all the action in this one came off as realistic- looking, and not jarring or disruptive (obviously not realistic in terms of plausibility, but I mean just visually). It was well done.I am an impatient person and generally don't like long movies. I check my watch about 100 times during the Hobbit. But this one held my attention and was entertaining. If you think you might like this movie, go for it. I expect you will like it.Warning for parents though - it was a little dark and violent at times.",The Lone Ranger

I'm not sure why all the critics are ""hating"" on The Lone Ranger, but the theater I was at was packed and EVERYONE was clapping at the end of the showing. The Hubby and I took our daughters ages 13 and 11 along with my parents who are in their 60's, everyone of us said this movie was the best action we had seen all year. The movie has something for every age group, tons of laugh out loud moments along with a bunch of hold onto your seat train crashes & gun fights.

679,justine-cheng,GREAT movie; don't pay attention to the critics....,9,8 July 2013,"When I first saw the trailer & such I was all about seeing this movie then I started to hear the ""critics"" perspectives filter in...then I questioned myself whether or not I 'really' wanted to see it. This is an amazing movie & I LOVED IT!! There's so much to love about it between the comic relief & what many of the actors brought to the movie. I was actually a bit taken back with how much William Fichtner brought the the table (so to speak) regarding Butch Cavendish's character. I hate to admit this but I didn't even recognize it was William!!! I know he's a great actor but how he dove right into the part was awesome! :) Ruth Wilson was perfect for the part of Rebecca Reid & although I'm not as familiar with Armie Hammer the chemistry he & Johnny Depp had was perfect for this film!!! I can't say enough good things about this film & I'll never pay attention to another ""critic"" again. This is the third time I considered not seeing a movie b/c of ""bad reviews"" given by ""critics"" & they were wrong once again!!!!I have a son who's 7y.o. & he can't stop talking about this film either...he loved it as well. In a nutshell...please go & see this movie...you won't regret it!!! :) Johnny Depp is phenomenal as always...I'm a huge fan of his & don't think it's possible for him to bring anything negative to any film he's involved in. He can do no wrong in my eyes...;) lol Thanks in advance for those who have taken the time to read my review!",The Lone Ranger
680,telstar53,Go see it!,10,8 July 2013,"Don't listen to the critics who are more concerned that they appear hip and sophisticated than they are about helping their readers find good movies. This movie is a hoot from start to finish. Johnny Depp was hilarious and the rest of the cast also did a great job. I laughed my ass off throughout most of the movie. The special effects were over the top, kind of like the car crash scenes in the Blues Brothers movies. Everyone I talked to who has seen the movie said they loved it, yet I have not seen a single positive review from any of the ""professional"" movie reviewers. They're wrong. Go see it! It is a fun couple of hours in the theater.",The Lone Ranger
681,clinton-kay-733-18685,Way better than the critics would have you believe,7,8 July 2013,"I have to admit, I bought tickets for this before I read the reviews, I was genuinely expecting to have to sit through a real turkey and to have to admit to myself that I had wasted the ticket price. I was wrong and very pleasantly surprised.Yes it is far-fetched and the story at times is unbelievable, the characters are larger than life almost too exaggerated but then hello people it is a film version of a comic book! I can only assume that those offering the most vocal criticism were expecting to see a gritty realistic Django derivative or relative film. This is about escapism, the good guy, AKA the man in the white hat overcoming and bettering the villains the guys in the black hats.It is after all a Disney film, family entertainment, seeking to appeal to family audiences. I enjoyed the film, it is a character fuelled romping adventure, great stunts, good dialogue, Johnny Depp is the real star of course, he steals it and yes, I admit he is pretty much a native Indian version of Jack Sparrow, but again think audience and what the film sets out to be, Disney and the crew have not in any way seduced or hoodwinked people in to thinking this is anything other than what it is, an adventure family orientated western themed good guys v the baddies film.I can't see it winning any awards, or being memorable, but it is certainly not as bad as some would have us believe, I would recommend the film to families and those who enjoy light hearted good natured and humoured escapism.Not as bad as they say really isn't doing the film justice, it is worth seeing if this type of film is your thing, if it isn't and you want the gritty realism then you are likely to be joining the ranks of those that did not like it.",The Lone Ranger
682,catlest-733-748953,Johnny Depp does NOT disappoint!,10,8 July 2013,"With Johnny Depp you always expect something different... This was a traditional Western and at the same time a send-up of the Westerns. Wonderful under-stated humor, poking pins in all the Western clichés. Except for the treatment of the Indians. Traditional Westerns didn't have time to show anything from the Indian point of views. Good for Depp, giving Tonto such personality! As for the action (and let's face it, you go to something like this for the action, because if you want deep drama and realism you watch Tennessee Williams instead) -the action is marvelous, some of the sequences took my breath away. I honestly didn't notice the time - when we got to the end I was thinking ""Over already?!?""",The Lone Ranger
683,gbcagle,Tonto is a Heyoka or sacred clown who takes John Reid on a spiritual journey to become the Lone Ranger,7,8 July 2013,"Johnny Depp sometimes hams it up as Tonto, who he plays as a Native American sacred clown or trickster figure. While the movie is a little long and Depp over acts at time, I enjoyed the great scenery of Monument Valley and seeing Armie Hammer become the Long Ranger. His sacred journey to becoming a spirit walker is full of magical realism which is so over the top that it can be distracting. However I finally took this movie as a live action Disney cartoon, full of improbable events and yet very entertaining. Perhaps there is no way a movie that cost this much but satirizes American capitalism, can satisfy critics, but I found it fun and serious at the same time. Armie Hammer's transformation from tender foot to avenging spirit was believable to me but I am an over sixty year old who still fondly remembers meeting Clayton Moore when he was no longer allowed to wear the mask. But in today's world a Robin Hood type is still a good ideal to have. To all of us who long for more social justice in the world sometimes you have to put on the mask.",The Lone Ranger
684,TheCasualWatcher,Don't let the press fool you,8,9 July 2013,"I just saw the Movie last night, and I have to say I really enjoyed it.In general, I understand that any stories that include American Indian characters are likely to stir our American guilt for the atrocities committed, but that is not the purpose of this movie.This is not a social commentary movie, or a documentary. This is a movie in the same vein as Shanghai nights. A fun action comedy, that is not too deep, full of fun action scenes, comedy, and ridiculousness.For folks who hate Depp's Tonto because of his non-native American-ness or the stereotyping, don't forget that the real Native Americans in the movie are portrayed as an intelligent and modern people who saw the writing on the wall. Additionally, even the Comanches in the movie called Tonto non-Comanche. If you go into the Movie expecting a documentary of Native American history, or a commentary on the American destruction of a whole culture, go find a different movie. But, if you want to see a Movie that pays homage to a cheesy western TV show that is full of laughs, explosions, and gun fights, then the lone ranger is right up your alley.",The Lone Ranger
685,Emkayach-733-658962,Great movie to share as a family,10,9 July 2013,"My kids are in their 30's and grand kids no older than 3 bit we all could have watched this one together and enjoyed it. The action scenes moved the story without stalling. The bad guys acted evilly and looked it, most of them. The message if there is one is that we are all flawed, some more so than others. But it all works out in the end. Depp constrains his inner Jack Sparrow or maybe it is his ""Deppness"" he is holding in check. Another great performance from an actor I have come to admire in his ability to create characters on the screen yet allow us to glimpse him. Armie (Lone Ranger) plays a believable green horn with a pure soul. The ""Red"" character is a delight and may please the 007 fans. So pick up the big tub of popcorn and settle in for a winner. I'm getting the video when it comes out to show to my train loving grand sons.",The Lone Ranger
686,ggroberg,Wonderful Western,9,9 July 2013,"I skimmed quite a few negative reviews of this film before seeing it. So I am both happy and a little irritated to report that this film is amazing. I'm happy because it surprised me. The film has depth and was thoroughly enjoyable. I'm irritated because so many people, including intelligent critics who know better, seem to have watched it while they were half asleep. Instead of encouraging people to take a closer look and celebrate rare mastery and craftsmanship, they are contributing to a chorus of dumbed down reactions: ""it's too long"" or ""it uses too much CGI"" or ""Buster Keaton did his OWN stunts."" (He also broke his neck.)It's a daunting task to make a new Western film. On one hand, the Western genre is tied to a lot of conventions and themes that feel out-dated and naive by today's standards. On the other hand, Westerns have left a pretty cool legacy. They reflect American history and culture as well as film history. So instead of abandoning something that seems distant and irrelevant, how do you build on it? How do you celebrate it? Westerns are epic films with natural scenery so vast they make our cgi-techno-alien worlds look small. They are rich with mythology, themes, stunts, history and cultural commentary. It's overwhelming to bring all these conventions together into a modern film, re-examine them, and then hold them up in a way that is relevant to the world we live in. But by some miracle, The Lone Ranger pulls it off. Hazah!Part of what makes this movie fun is its awareness of the great Westerns. It joyfully tips its hat to the great films, actors and directors that went before. (Maybe that's partly why I'm bitter about all the negative reviews? It feels like failing to appreciate this film is akin to peeing on John Wayne.) If you love classic films, you'll find plenty of references to films from a better, vanished time, as well as a few modern contributions. I was reminded of The Searchers, Buster Keaton in The General, Once Upon a Time in the West, and Runaway (2009) to name a few. With Johnny Depp playing Tonto, I guess I better admit that I couldn't help be reminded of Pirates of the Caribbean. But what's wrong with that? The fun and spectacle in this film is a thrill.The movie is two and half hours long. My wife liked it, but says that certain parts felt a little drawn out. For me it was just right. A longer running time just meant that there was more to enjoy. It has a lot to say about a lot of things, and I think that's at the heart of what makes it great. Not that it's overly heavy and sincere. There's plenty of fun, and the film is aware of its own silliness. (""Do you know what Tonto means in Spanish?"") But in addition to the lighter side, there's a lot of depth and conviction. The mythological West in this film is full of symbols about the world we live in: emotional scars, racial minorities, religious hypocrisy, unbridled military power, government and the rule of law (or lack of it), and above all, the unstoppable corporate machine. I guess it's a film about justice. Democrats will like it.One quick note about the music: The Lone Ranger's theme song comes from the William Tell Overture. It's fun and familiar but I was worried it might feel a little cheesy for a modern hero in a modern film. I'm happy to report that when the trumpets sounded they weren't so much celebrating a slick, perfect, black-and-white hero as they were announcing the chaos that was about to unravel. It reminded me of a French farce, in a good way. It worked. It was fun. It made me think.Matt Zoller Seitz believes this film is ""likely to be re-evaluated twenty years from now, and described as 'misunderstood.'"" I agree, but hope it won't take 20 years.If I have one complaint it's that this movie feels like it was merchandised and Disney-ized before it was even released. There was an ad for a new video game depicting Tonto and Captain Jack Sparrow before the movie began. They were smelling each other. Kind of funny, but also ridiculous. (Why do we even have ads in paid theatrical screenings?!) Out-of-control corporate greed is at the heart of this movie in more ways than one. And with all the negative critical reviews, I'm worried that a fat, cigar-smoking executive will force a sequel to be made that's superficial, instead of handing the reigns back to Verbinski for another wild ride.",The Lone Ranger
687,lauriecason,We loved it,10,9 July 2013,"I cannot believe ""The Lone Ranger"" got any negative reviews. My husband and I saw it and we so enjoyed it. We will buy this one when it comes out on DVD.

The theater we went to was full and everyone seem to really enjoy it. Thanks for all the great movies you have starred in and co-produced.

688,anup346,"Not only the Magic, but explains the Magic",10,10 July 2013,"It wasn't hard to outdo the preachy contrived plot of the 2003 Ranger movie, but this one took a step beyond to become a mainstay.First, it is an adventure film, a Western adventure. The Lone Ranger is a mystique character, and part of the challenge is that he tries to bring men to justice alive. Same for Superman. If they didn't have this challenge, they would have no conflict whatsoever. It makes for a puzzle.Tonto takes center stage here, but unlike the 2003 disaster, he is a character instead of a symbol of a godlike race. Here, no favorites are played. The most evil ones in this story are a pair of white men, and other white men they enlist, but we aren't given sermons about this.Depp is great as Tonto. The museum scenes are a bit too much for me, but it is good for the kids. The out of sequence bits work, partly because they aren't emphasized too much. Depp, as Tonto, craftily plays this with a subtle humor, and that is just what is needed for this.There is the magic and mystique of the Ranger, but also an explanation given for it, as ""Nature out of balance"". We are dealing with a supernatural chain of events which do allow the Lone Ranger to ride a horse through and on top of railroad cars.Great blend of humor and adventure, and at the same time a crafty blend of Shakespeare and Indiana Jones. This is better than what meets the eye, and what meets the eye is extra special in itself, with plenty of eye candy for men and women.",The Lone Ranger
689,semmler-david-734-813353,"The Lone Ranger: A Clunky, Convoluted, Bombastic, Dark, Fun, and Ultimately Entertaining Mess",7,10 July 2013,"As ""The Lone Ranger"" rode into its last twenty minutes, it became something that I did not expect until that point - fun! With Silver galloping along the rooftops of moving trains, John Reid on his back, Tonto hopping between numerous cars full of ore, the William Tell Overture blaring in the background, and the bad guys shooting everything else to kingdom come, what had started out as a dark, occasionally humorous, and convoluted story became an entertaining joyride that I wished had only carried through the first 130 minutes that had preceded it. This is a long movie! Clocking in at two-and-a-half hours, the weight of the film is evident by the time the credits start to roll. My biggest complaint about it is that they tried to cram too much stuff in and it got kind of messy. Multiple subplots involving the Native American tribes, train track building, silver mining, war treaties, and a completely pointless collection of sequences involving a young boy hearing the entire tale from an older version of Tonto, became just too much for me to handle (and I like long movies). But these made the film clunky. They tried to frame the movie as a story the Old Tonto was telling to the young boy but I feel if they cut all that extra fat off, it would've made it worlds better!As the titular characters, Armie Hammer as John Reid and Johnny Depp as Tonto do an admirable job and the comical arguments and situations they get each other into are humorous. Helena Bonham Carter felt underused and rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things as one of many dancers at a promiscuous club Tonto and the Lone Ranger visit at one point. William Fichtner, Tom Wilkinson, and Barry Pepper do fine as the villains. Fichtner in particular steals the show as the cannibalistic outlaw. I loved him for some reason!Story-wise, while it is overly convoluted, it does end up being pretty predictable in the end. No surprises here and the twists won't really catch you off guard though one relationship between two characters did come as a nice unexpected moment. Again, my main complaint here is that it was just too much stuff and showing something then coming back to it at a different point to show it was out of order just became kind of tiresome. And, man, I hated the sequences with the little boy and the Old Tonto! If they had just gotten rid of that, it would have been a vast improvement - I know I've said it two or three times already...Overall, though, the Lone Ranger did end up being entertaining. It's nothing great. It will definitely be compared with Pirates of the Caribbean as much of the music and many of the outlandish stunts seem to have been ripped right from the pages of those films. The story, while not being very original, is still one we like to watch and it makes a nice popcorn muncher for a late summer night. I just wish more of it could have been like the last twenty minutes...My Recommendation: While entertaining, it's safe to say you'd enjoy watching this just as much at home on DVD several months from now.",The Lone Ranger

After viewing it, I gave quite a bit of thought to the tepid reviews it received and came to this conclusion. The demographic age groups targeted for the most attention by the entertainment industry (teens - mid 30's) didn't grow up with The Lone Ranger like those of my generation. Trust me, at the end when the villain appears to have won the day, those three trumpet notes that herald the beginning of The William Tell Overture rang out and us old farts in the audience choked up, rubbed at the goosebumps and knew justice would prevail. That climax makes right any minor shortcomings it might have had. Go see it - if only for the ending.",The Lone Ranger

It was a huge waste of my time. The parts that were supposed to be funny, were not funny. Armie Hammer wasn't a good choice for the ""Lone Ranger,"" and couldn't be taken seriously as this dorky attorney.The part where the little boy went to the circus and the old Native American retold the story was my least favorite part of the movie.

Plus a Wendigo is an Eastern legend, not a Western one, so why not just use a skinwalker reference? Anyway, the first 20 minutes were best (great bad guy plus an interesting way to introduce the story), and I liked the rest of the movie, but would have kept it simpler and a little more serious. If you are at all a fan of Johnny Depp, or southwestern scenery/history, or the idea of the Lone Ranger, you should enjoy this movie, even if you find yourself writing more realistic scenes in your head as you're watching.",The Lone Ranger
694,ultimatepowa,Great but it had some immersion breaking elements.,8,12 July 2013,"Throughout the movie (this is not a plot spoiler, rather points out something that may have not irritated you had you not read, so you have been warned) Tonto tells a story to a boy named ""Will."" That beginning scene and those scenes with those two are the most artificial scenes... ever. Never put animations over Johny Depp's vibrate face again. How much money did you guys spend to get Johny in that movie only to throw more money into covering him up with CGI? Makeup on faces = good. CGI on faces = not good, especially when it's Johny Depp. Why? Because CGI has a very unreal look to it, especially when viewed next to real things. For making explosions and unreal effects, CGI works. For making things that the director wants to look real, it won't work.Nonetheless it's a minor flaw in what's an overall good movie. Because of the annoying intro, the movie takes a little to pick up, but it ends up coming together nicely.As for historical accuracy, it's more accurate than it is inaccurate, discounting the story of course. Most of the Native Americans are much-like what they would have been in the past, except for Tonto; which is to be expected. Other than the more often than not gun slinging, it's an accurate version of the wild west. I loved their depiction of the United States Military too; especially the Captain and his actions (you'll understand later.) Very accurate, and very greyish point of view, rather than black and white. Nicely done Disney.There are two main character's in this story; Tonto and Reid. Don't get confused thinking it's all about Reid. Remember, Tonto's the one telling the story.Here's a tip if you haven't seen the movie when you go to first watch it. Forget the name. It's a nameless movie about a somewhat historically accurate Hollywood version of the wild west. Congratulations, the movie just got 10 times better. Enjoy.",The Lone Ranger

The original sidekicks were intelligent contributing partners to the title characters, but were clearly the followers, not the leaders.Although aimed at the adolescent audience, both original series were dramas, not comedies. Today's movies aim more for special effects and stunts to attract audiences.Both movies were very disappointing, especially The Green Hornet.

Maybe because it tried to buck the recent trend in movies of raunchy comedy, weak and superficial story lines and characters, and rampant CGI animation in place of live stunts and more realistic explosions???The development of the characters was strong, as was the acting.You don't see a lot of apparent CGI animation the way you do in most of the action ""blockbusters"" these days.The stunts were on point.The entire movie is peppered with legitimately funny lines and events that had the entire theater going off throughout the movie -- but it's reasonably clean and kid-friendly.Bottom line: see it for yourself, and enjoy it for yourself.",The Lone Ranger

Love the old guns, the horses were beautiful, the trains were awesome, the landscape breath taking. The critics always let me know when a movies going to be good there snooty opinion over thinking things tells me yep I'm gonna love that Johnny Depp again. Action packed loved it even my wife was laughing and very much enjoyed herself so thank you.The bad guy just has to die but when in the heck will that happen never it seems but hang in there will it be Johnny or will it be the Lone Ranger.

I am glad I went!! I did not notice the length of the movie at all. I have seen several long movies (LOTR fan and saw all 3- was ready to leave The Two Towers after 1.5 hrs of sitting). This is not something would take a kid under 12 to see as there are a couple of scenes that are graphic, BUT it is a really good story, the stunts are off the chain, and the casting was awesome! This is a movie I will buy and add to my home collection. There is also home-hitting truth as to the treatment of Native Americans which could be used in a high school classroom to generate terrific discussions. AND it is definitely a Big Screen Movie- I wish I had seen it at IMAX the first time!",The Lone Ranger
702,hilalskbn,Good Movie To Fall Asleep To,3,15 July 2013,"First of all, this movie is nearly 3 hours long with not much of an interesting and ""full of twists"" story that there are many movies like that kind of story lines which deserve 3 hours full of your attention. This was certainly not one of them. That's probably why i fell asleep at the theater. Other than the ridiculous time issue the chemistry between Hamer and Jack Sparrow-thats right people i am calling him that because he is exactly the same as in physical way with a touch of a white face paint and as in character too- is awful. There is no chemistry at all. The characters' relationship is often confusing you find yourself not caring about them as writers don't care about it too and it is not believable. I don't buy their supposed to be awkward but then understandable relationship in this movie. The Jack Sparrow with white face paint. Seriously whats up with Johnny Depp. I mean really. He is a good actor and all but he plays the same guy over and over and over. And he gets 35 million dollars over and over for playing the exact same guy. The mad hatter crazy guy with white face paint, Willy Wonka mad guy with white face paint, Edward Scissorhands, 4 fricking movies of Jack Sparrow without the white paint but i guess you can obviously see the picture.. And they are still paying him for this it is ridiculous..Well, and the movie was full of supernatural elements. As the lead role is an ""indian"" as called in the movie a few times which was weird. I mean are they Indian like no. I am not sure about the correctness of that but i am pretty sure that they are not supposed to be called one. It was weird. Anyways, for people who don't like surprise weird things like the lone ranger is undead and the main villain is a Wendigo etc. as my friends did not enjoy that but as i personally like supernatural odd things i liked that asset of the movie. But it does not change the fact that this movie was full of scenes with bad humour and really juvenile attempts to make jokes.And Armie Hammer's character is so weird that he is an obvious pacifist he doesn't use guns at all but in the scene where they are buried in the sand just with their heads out he saves himself from the sand but he just leaves the guy who just saved his life from a train wreck and he also is a pacifist which says that he cares about human life but he just leaves Jack Sparrow there to die..very slowly. This was a very out of character thing to do. And there was a scene where there is obviously going to be a gun shooting and he just says as he is a pacifist "" STOP THIS IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE BLA BLA BLA"" which seemed very unrealistic and he did a few times it was almost annoying. And made me hate his character for that. Although this movie was a huge flop and i think some scenes were kind of gore i believe children can enjoy this movie. All i liked was the back-story line of Jack Sparrow which was told in surprisingly good shots and narrative style. Other than that i liked the last fight scene which had a very god music to it :) but i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone just to watch the last fight scene that is an absurd idea as this movie was too.And lastly what was up with that old Jack Sparrow's telling the story to the kid. That had nothing to add, no significant contribution whatsoever to the story. It was pointless probably was there to add some more comedy. . What a waste of time. You don't need this movie. Just watch Gilbert Grape for a change and yeah you will be surprised!",The Lone Ranger
703,brush527,The Lone Ranger is NOT a disappointment!!!!!!!,10,16 July 2013,"I have this vision of movie critics biding their time waiting to dog pile on The Lone Ranger before it even hit the theater. I love this movie and saw it 3 times over the holiday weekend. Easily one of my top three favorites this year. I am genuinely upset that it didn't do well at the box office while ridiculous movies like Grown Ups 2 and Despicable Me 2 took home the bacon! (Not to say that they are bad movies, I will probably see them eventually) The Lone Ranger is beautifully filmed and refreshingly has very little CGI effects in it. The acting is stupendous and the story is very enjoyable and keeps you thinking and guessing the whole way through. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp make a great team as The Lone Ranger and Tonto respectively. Hammer is charming and portrays a very good John Reid (the lone ranger), man of the law turned outlaw after realizing the corruptness of people in power. Johnny Depp is not my favorite actor but I enjoy his movies and I give credit where credit is due. He has a remarkable ability to portray any kind of character. I kept expecting to see some Captain Jack Sparrow in Tonto and I can honestly say I didn't see any similarities. Who cares if he is not Native American! Sometimes its about who can portray the character, not their ethnicity. The supporting actors were a joy to watch and the entire cast gave off this vibe that feels like they enjoyed working together and had fun filming this movie. That kind of camaraderie comes across on the screen and makes the viewing experience better, in my opinion. I feel like critics had a vendetta against The Lone Ranger even before it hit the theater. I haven't met anyone yet who saw it and didn't love it. Go see it and formulate your own opinion, don't depend on critics to tell you what is worth seeing.",The Lone Ranger
704,thoradalv,"Overall, this is another great Disney movie.",10,24 August 2013,"Very similar to Verbinski's previous series titled ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", this movie is funny, creative and acted out very well. Johnny Depp's performance as Spirit Guide ""Tonto"" is hilarious, just as many of the scenes in the movie are. This movie has received a lot of bad reviews from major critics, which saddens me as this is a really good movie. Going into the theater with a family of 8 costs quite a bit, but this movie was definitely worth the time and money. This movie was better than the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", which is arguably one of my favorite movies.Overall, I'd recommend this movie to anyone; even if they don't like Westerns. This is more like ""Pirates of Caribbean"" than ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and doesn't have that Western feel most think it does. Definitely worth a 10/10, I'll watch it again when I can.",The Lone Ranger
705,iceredfatboy-742-988870,"Oh, so that is what the Lone Ranger.......",9,19 July 2013,"First of all, forget the critics. Some movies are better judged based on your own opinion than someone else's. This movie was a mesh of the best westerns and the comedy of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" combined. Everyone knows of the Lone Ranger. Johnny Depp just puts the story of him and Tanto into place. The period history in the movie is great. The action sequences are remarkable. When I saw the movie I truly felt as if I were there. Everything was so vivid and alive. Even if Johnny Depp were not in the movie, it would be a great movie. I saw it at the theater and plan on buying it on Blu Ray when it comes out. It truly is a great movie with a superb story to it. To me, Disney hit a home run with the movie. If you are/were a Lone Ranger fan then this movie is a must!!!",The Lone Ranger

Johnny Depp's performance was fantastic, I didn't recognize it and forgot he was on the movie. Its long but we didn't mind because it was fun to watch. I'm not a fan of having to remember what Americans did to native Americans, but since its the true I'll have to oversee that. The script is good; unexpected original dialogs. I love it! Its fun, don't miss.Not your original lone ranger at all, this fresh story is full of adventure, special effects, good photography, great acting, what else can you ask for? But most of all it is entertaining, you get your money worth. Best movie I have seen lately.",The Lone Ranger
707,Btdt14,Enjoyed it!,8,20 July 2013,"My 13 year old son and I saw this movie today and we both enjoyed it very much. I thought it was an interesting story and it kept us both engaged for the full length of the movie. In fact, I wasn't really ready for it to end when it did. The story made sense to me, not sure why the critics say it was all over the place, and I truly don't understand why the critics rated it so poorly.Tonto was a funny character but he also was intriguing. He had me wondering is he crazy, tormented, or more sane than anyone else? The Lone Ranger at first seemed naive to the point of being juvenile, but his character matured throughout the film. The romantic tension between John and Rebecca was not typical but I felt it was still appropriate and compelling.Overall it was a fun action movie, but it also had enough substance to keep this Mom from losing interest. I personally liked it better than the Pirates of the Caribbean films.",The Lone Ranger
708,treeseee,Awesome,10,22 July 2013,"It wasn't what I expected -it was better. How anyone can dis this movie is beyond me - it was great entertainment and fun and I am going to the theater to see it again. Once the music kicks in you almost want to jump up and shout HI HO Silver Away yourself. Don't listen to the critics - go and be entertained. I loved the old Lone Ranger TV movies and if you want that you won't get it, but be opened to different and it will please. Personally, I hope they make a sequel - I'll definitely be on board for that -it would be ""GOOD TRADE"" :) I was surprised at Armie Hammer - he was a good guy that you disliked sometimes because he's above our own conscience thoughts of revenge - and he pulled it off - Kudos for making me mad at you a couple of times in the movie. And Johnny Depp's character did not look like Jack Sparrow - he did a good job of being Tonto and his facial antics were a crack up - I laughed out loud and so did the company I was with. BTW, I'm from that area of the country and it was great to see the scenery - it made me homesick. Like I said, go and enjoy a true adventure and smile - its time to have some fun!",The Lone Ranger
709,snaike92,No Idea What the Critics are Whining About...,7,25 July 2013,"I honestly don't. While the movie was not fantastic, it was full of action, comedic relief, and decent characters. While there were some cliché characters and moments, they were to fully be expected for the source material. The parts that ""dragged"" were mostly important, as they provided key back story for the characters. Johnny Depp is great as Tonto and provides a strange, unique sense of humor that appeals to all ages. Armie Hammer works well and provides a certain naivety that helps the film along, although there are times where you will face-palm over what the character does. My main gripe with the film is the runtime though. At almost 3 hours you will find yourself checking your watch at times, but again, these moments are few and don't detract from the movie too much. This is one of those movies to see with the family or when you've got time to kill. Definitely worth seeing once as a matinée.",The Lone Ranger
710,rists,We loved the Lone Ranger,10,27 July 2013,"Sometimes the critics ratings are right, but this time I have to say they are way off base. I guess every ones tastes are different, but I thought this was by far the BEST movie I have see in the last couple of years. Totally action packed, great sound effects, and Jonny Depp made a fantastic Tonto. The movie helped to explain how the Lone Ranger and Tonto came to be. Parts were extremely funny and other parts had you gripping your seat. As compared to the Lone Ranger from the days of my child hood I found it very up to date. The way the movie ended left room for a sequel, I really hope they do one. The kids loved it and so did I. The BEST movie this year. You won't regret seeing it.",The Lone Ranger

Redboxed this with my 15-yo daughter and we LOVED this movie! Just enough 'real' Lone Ranger story to appease your sentimentality (for those over 40 who might actually remember the show!) and just enough real history to give a little lesson on this country... all that combined with great action, great comedy and Depp being Depp. Not to mention the song, appropriately saved until just the right moment. It had all the right elements in perfect proportion. Wish that I had gotten to see it in the theater. For now - I'll be looking forward to the sequel(s)!",The Lone Ranger

My dad used to tell me about THE LONE RANGER he watched on TV (black and white) when he was very young So I took him to see the movie He was absolutely amazed, and I think the message of The Lone Ranger is so valid, how many problems and damage the human greed caused. Despite looking for justice, he never killed someone with a gun! Awesome movie!! Great music!!! Johnny Depp and the whole cast,fantastic! a movie for the whole family Disney chose a work of art Please, don't miss it! 159 enjoyable minutes Worth very penny spent for us, and the making of the movie don't listen to the critic watch the trailer and you will see! a movie for the whole family",The Lone Ranger
713,guitrona,Lone Ranger will become a cult movie,9,29 July 2013,Definitely this movie was a tough one to produce and the producers took their chances to go for it. I really enjoyed it: it took care of the details and was a pleasure for the true fans to watch it. I really appreciate how Lone Ranger fans were taken in consideration even if they are not the majority of today's audience. There is a lot of nostalgia when watching it.Before watching the movie I recommend to study a little of the Lone Range background: It was original a radio broadcast not even a T.V. show and be aware that Lone Ranger is more than a superhero than a western legend.I want to thanks all the people involve to make this movie. I really believe this is going to become a cult movie. There was a lot of dedication and I enjoyed watching real action scenes without CGIs all the time. It is very hard to find movies with true action sets and sequences play outdoors with actual main role actors playing risky and action scenes.Maybe the length was too long for the average watcher but again for the fans it was perfect (a formula of extended movie option like Lord of the Rings could result better I guess leaving theatrical version shorter).Johnny Depp was very good but yes his portrait of Tonto resembles Captain Sparrow. As I like very much his performance for me then was a plus rather than a negative aspect.John Carter and Lone Ranger are now a couple of great recent Disney movies I really like and both show us heroes from the past. Looking forward to get a Bluray copy.,The Lone Ranger

Driving home through the wide open spaces of South Dakota with the prairie on one side & the Black Hills on the other completes the adventure. Back home I am so happy to see my 2 beautiful horses.Having grown up in the 50's watching The Lone Ranger I'm now hooked on the Internet reruns.

715,rosietheriveter2008,"A fantasy ball, with the exception of one piece of bitter reality",8,1 August 2013,"The critics took a dump on ""John Carter,"" and they did here too. I think they just enjoy watching Disney create ""big"" movies that they can turn into flops by the strength of their opinions alone. A pity. The is a very funny film with huge over-the-top action (just like the action that made Robert Downey Jr.'s ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie a huge success.) Johnny Depp plays, with great eccentricity a character who was written to be considered eccentric, possibly insane, and most definitely deluded. So Depp plays the part with great bizarreness,and everyone asks why Johnny Depp chose to play Tonto so weirdly. Easy, folks: Tonto is WRITTEN weird. And entertaining. And heroic. Depp is right on the money with this one. The one major misstep I found in this film was a very serious and tragic scene of a wholesale slaughter of attacking Native Americans. Unfortunately, after it was over, the film got silly and over-the-top again. I found myself laughing again eventually, but it took a leap of faith. Frankly, comedy and genocide rarely mix well.... For Western film buffs, you can have a great time pointing out the cinematic allusions that crop up all over the entire film. The movie comes right out of the starting gate parodying the opening scene from ""Once Upon A Time In The West.""",The Lone Ranger
716,jdamron_1988,:),10,30 December 2013,"I absolutely loved this movie! I am in a younger generation, and saw some of the old lone rangers with my grandfather! Don't listen to the critics this is a good movie. you get action and old west and comedy and a great cast of actors. We all now that Tonto does not portray an actual Indian. We all know that this is re-vamped from decades ago but it still remains a good movie. My parents still enjoy sharing things from their childhoods. and to be perfectly honest there are far worse movies for children to be watching and show. They need a dose of the old before modern technology! The first 20 or so minutes is a little slow starting but after that it gets going on a great pace. Especially trying to figure out how the damn horse does that! The bird is absolutely hilarious! Johnny Depp done a great job portraying a broken mind in Tonto. I will keep this movie in my collection it is a great watch and great memories come with it! If we could only get that from half of the movies we watch. WELL DONE CAST AND CREW!!",The Lone Ranger

We encountered some of the filming crew during our vacation in 2012 through New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah on more than one occasion at different hotels and RV parks. The filming locations and the computerized scenery manipulation was amazing. The cast and filming crew were so friendly to all the local residents and vacationers. My family enjoyed the movie. It is a long film over two hours but the plot and action are very entertaining. This movie allows you to escape your real life and isn't that the reason we go to the movies.

I took along my 12 old boy, who commented 'The Lone Ranger?', Lego has a new set called ""The Lone Ranger"". Undaunted we saw the movie. It was thoroughly entertaining! I must admit when they started playing THE MUSIC,I almost leapt to my feet and cheered on our heroes.My son liked the music too, but he didn't have the 'cultural' reference. As we left the theater my son said ""that was almost the best movie I ever saw, I want to see it again!"" (best movie was Iron Man 3 watched in Imax 3D.) I agreed with him, I definitely would see The Lone Ranger a second time.The only thing I didn't care for was the violence it was very brutal and gruesome, especially the desert ambush and its murders.

719,stressedtechy,"Had great potential, but a poor mix of comic and serious.",5,11 August 2013,"I went to see The Lone Ranger and can now quite understand why it was not a great box office success when released in America.Two parallel running story styles; when the immediate plot or story involves the development of the Lone Ranger character then this is tackled in a relatively serious way; however when Tonto is the principle centre of attention then it's treated as a comic farce.The trouble is that these two styles do not mix well in this production. Had it just been done as a serious re-invention of the Lone Ranger it could have provided an interesting alternative to the current run of Si- Fi based super-hero films. If done purely as a comic satire, then in the same way that Blazing Saddles has achieved serious cult status then this may well have done the same. It's just that mixing the serious with the silly has resulted in a confusing film with no real direction.A shame really as this Lone Ranger had such potential. A story-line based around the expansion of the railways across America, greed and corruption, the treatment of the indigenous Indian population (and Chinese immigrant workers), love and the importance of family all looked at in one way or another yet totally messed up by this juxtaposition of serious and silly.One problem is that it may well make Hollywood look even more inward and restrict themselves to just safe bets, so we'll see even more sequels of known safe moneymakers franchises rather than trying anything new and exciting (but that bit more risky).",The Lone Ranger
720,denm321,Excellent Movie!!!,10,15 August 2013,"The Lone Ranger was very enjoyable. If you remember the TV series, there are lots of references to the characters. At the same time, the movie script is a full and true story in its own right. Both Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp were excellent. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you hesitate because it is a long movie being two and a half hours, I think the time flew by because there was never a dull moment. Also I like to think I am getting my money's worth and a too short movie would not give me my money's worth. I do not think that Johnny was just repeating his pirate character in his depiction of Tonto. They are two separate characters. Armie was a very good lone ranger. His character was interesting and his was the one that grew and changed by the premise of the story.

It has action and violence but most of all Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer who are excellent together.

My husband is very much more discerning than me and he had tears running down his face at times.

This version of the Lone Ranger explains the legend, how a fundamentally good man could become a hero, overcoming his own naivety to deal with the real world and become a legend. Depp's Tonto has depths of anguish not seen in previous versions, and masterful physical comedy worthy of Chaplin. The movie rides roughshod over the TV version, deconstructing our Western myths while paying homage to countless classic movies.

This film is one of the best films I've seen in a while- It's completely and utterly fantastic! The critics have done this film no justice, which isn't right. How long has it been since a western has been on our screens? This film is very funny, it has proper music, fast paced action, an evil cannibal, an awesome train chase and Johnny Depp-what more could you ask for?? This film also has some new actors in it, which is a nice change, who really are ones to watch in the future. Armie Hammer and Helena Bonham Carter really played their parts well- great acting. Lone Ranger is a quality film, and you can tell how good it is by the actors- they all look like they're truly enjoying the set, the atmosphere, the whole experience of it, which comes a cross in the film, thus making it more realistic and makes you really feel like you're there with them throughout the tense action scenes.It's a sad true story, which is why this film is so powerful. It's lovely to have a true story like that to watch which has been made so brilliantly and so clearly cared for- attention to detail is spectacular and is totally worth the money spent on it- it's a quality film which we don't get to see too often nowadays, and what's up with the critics saying that it's 'not very realistic'??

How many movies have there been about ""Robin Hood?""

A brilliant and thought- provoking reinvention of the two main characters - and what powerful imagery, with echoes of classic westerns, Buster Keaton even Samuel Beckett.

It is rich of wisdom and shows us how to behave ourselves on the path of life. Mr. Depp plays well, serious and ironic, hard and so sad... and he has great support.

His Tonto however was absolutely dead-pan, drop-dead-laughing, perfect. Just perfect. A couple of the lines had me laughing from the gut in a way I haven't since seeing some of the stand-up masters for the first time. I've never seen such purely perfect comedy and delivery in this type of movie. I'd see a Tonto movie every summer before a Jack Sparrow. Really something to remember, that movie. To balanced the campy and the dead serious and yet be authentic to the Lone Ranger serials was not something I thought could be done - either it would be too Dukes Of Hazzard lame or too Superman returns self-serious. No spoiler here I think to just say the last line/gag of the movie floored me laughing such as I haven't been since being a teenager and smoking pot watching Bill Hicks or something...so unexpected to find a zillion- dollar movie that truly fun for me.

Right from the beginning, to the right till the end I was completely taken in.Great action, Great comedy, Johnny was awesome. I honestly can't Find fault in this film. I must admit, from all the bad things I've heard about this film, I really pushed myself to push play on the remote. But I'm really glad I did. I'd watch this film again......and again, that's how much I loved it.

I believe all the actors, especially Johnny Depp, did an outstanding job. I will admit I was not happy with the way his character was portrayed. I do understand many people from that era were actually treated much worse and the movie cleaned it up very well. Disney did a great job portraying this era as they did. The premise of the movie was great but, unfortunately, that was a period of time in our American history that I do not believe we acted in the best interest of mankind.

It should be in the same category as any of the recently successful superhero shows and certainly better than the animation attempts. Our expectations were low and we were pleasantly surprised; realistically, maybe the low expectations was part of the reason we enjoyed it.We bought into all the negative reviews and skipped the big screen on this one; our loss, and lesson learned. What is hard to understand is why the critics destroyed the box office potential of the high budget movie. Losing money can't be good for business so I suppose we could do without Disney movies...the critics have been given too much power or Disney isn't playing ball to their liking.",The Lone Ranger

I enjoyed every minute of this movie, and so did multiple people I know. I always loved the old television series, and this movie brought it back 10 fold!I truly believe the ONLY reason this movie was so low-rated, was because of the critics, who ruined it.... but do not listen to them, watch it for yourself! I also believe that the ONLY reason these simple-minded people gave it a horrible review is that in this day and time, everything has to be either about sex, naked girls, violence, drugs, etc. Nobody can appreciate a classic film anymore, one that is clean for just about all ages.... I get tired of most movies these days who can't go a single line without dropping a curse word, or disgusting sex scenes....So just watch it for yourself, and you be the judge.

It's a lot of fun and the story and the characters have some interesting twists. After about half the movie the further plot becomes kind of obvious and you might think it's getting boring. But the movie manages it to keep it interesting with a lot of funny scenes and a whole lot of action in the end of the movie. If you liked captain jack sparrow, you are definitely going to like Tonto played by Johnny Depp, he's just made for this kind of characters. The Lone Ranger himself is also a very interesting character and Armie Hammer plays him very well. The main bad guy has a cool background story which reveals in the progress of the movie. The other characters are a bit flat, and the ""romance"" of the movie also lacks of interesting scenes.All in all the movie is underrated in my opinion and well worth watching!",The Lone Ranger

This is a great movie...its funny at times its harsh at times action packed at the right moments. its over the top when it needs to be. I found my self totally involved with the movie to the very end. Its a different look at The Lone Ranger and why he wore the mask are also in a way the same reason Tonto wares full face paint. The action was meant to be over the top it was part of the whole experience part of the ride witch is really the best things about a good Johnny Depp movie...its a ride.

But if you grew up with the Lone Ranger during the 50s and 60s you will appreciate all the humor, subtle references, and blatant exaggeration this film offers. With that perspective it is wonderful! I love how for the first time, Tonto is the lead character. I also love the offered translation of ""Keemo Sabe"", and I especially love Tonto's last line of the story, ""Don't ever do that again."" Not to mention the over-the-top chase scene. Magnificent! There are only two things missing from the original TV show - the Lone Ranger with his arm in a sling, and someone saying ""Who was that masked man anyway?""

I guess viewers want super natural, massive killings that seem to be happening in daily life, I at times prefer being entertain and laugh. Not to say Johnny Depp is not capable of all kinds acting abilities as proved by his movies. I like to think that every actor or actress have their own style, that is why there are so many kinds of movies to please all likes. Thank you, for the freedom to express our thoughts",The Lone Ranger
739,raystar122,Terrible movie,1,29 December 2013,"This movie suffers from a basic flaw; we're trying to engage as many people as possible. It tries to be everything to everyone and comes out a bloated mess. It didn't surprise me that so many writers were credited. It felt like a mash of different story ideas, and rather than choosing to tell one or two good stories, they decided to shoehorn 6 plots and sub plots into the same movie. It became the worst soup I've tasted in a long time, especially since I know the story and I know history. Too many cooks spoil the soup.I am insulted that they chose to play on Johnny Depp's name and reputation to sell this as good entertainment. This reminds me of the song that claims to be ironic over and over, yet has not a bit of irony in the story, just bad fortune. If you liked the movie, good for you. I hated it.",The Lone Ranger

I'll admit I do have a short attention span, but considering I made it through man of steel with only a few minor lapses in attention. I must say I'm not entirely satisfied.I love johnny depp, but I just don't feel captured at all by this film. I wish I was. I do hope I may watch it again and have it grab my attention. I don't even find it particularly funny (and I laugh at everything)Maybe its also something to do with not understanding its basis. I give it 5 out of 10 because it does try. And i'll accept its great they did it mostly with stunts and not CGI. I'd also like to say, unimpressed by the background music. Music makes a movie and its failed on this occasion.",The Lone Ranger

I know that a lot of hard work and time went into making this film and it shows in a truly enjoyable experience. Well written story and probably one of the top ten final sequences in movie history. If you don't want to watch the whole movie, at the very least watch the train chase at the end. It is worth it. Wonderful score with a good use of the Lone Ranger theme at the end. Great performances by Hammer, Depp, Fichtner, Wilkinson and Pepper. If I had to have one complaint about it that would be the CGI jack rabbits. I think that things like that are not really needed in a film like this. I felt the same way about the CGI animals in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It will definitely be one of those films that will become a classic a few years from now and everyone will wonder why it was panned in the summer of 2013.

Did they ever?This was one of the most FUN movies I have seen in a long time. When I was a little kid and I heard the theme song to the Lone Ranger, I came running into the living room with childish excitement. This movie brought my heart back to those days and tossed in just the right level of comedy to remind me that I was now in my 40's. ALL of the acting was good, and FUN...Suitable for family viewing, date night, or a girls night in...Don't pass on this movie because of lame reviews by critics.

It has a disturbing undercurrent of cheapness to it that will leave any good part of you cringing.An unexplained and nonsensical beginning and ending with Tonto.Completely unsatisfying character development of the heroes who by the end of the film don't appear to be much better than the unbelievable villains.Speaking of villains, they are hackneyed bad guy stereotypes with re-hashed B-movie routines and grimaces. Where are the adults to write a decent script? Where are the directors/producers to create depth and sincerity? This movie disturbed me, it made me sad, and then it made me mad.UGH!",The Lone Ranger

In conclusion, I appreciate it and I will watch it again. It isn't a masterpiece.

This abridged storyline paid justice to the history of the Lone Ranger. Tonto (Johnny Depp) was over the top very well done. Todays modern remakes seem to always fail and fall short indicative of the lack writers in todays movie industry. This version of the Masked Man and his Sidekick did not insult the legend and story line we have grown to know I hope the sequel (if any) continues to complement the adventures of the Masked Man and Tonto, silver too.

But The Lone Ranger was such a well created movie that I barely noticed that it was longer than the average movie. There was no long dull scenes just put in to be filler. As usual, Johnny Depp stole the show. He played Tonto incredibly well while sneaking in his signature comedic style. The Lone Ranger himself I think could have been better.My entire family watched this together and we all loved it.

748,sidfred-984-776142,great old-fashioned western with comedy and heart,8,25 April 2014,"I went to the trouble to join IMDb just to review this movie and say what is wrong with all the critics?! The Lone Ranger has a sly sense of humor (the movie, not the character, who's played as a sweet, but naive young man) great action and strong performances throughout the cast. True, it shows a jaundiced view of the railroad bigwigs and the army, but that's probably closer to the truth than we would like. Maybe the theatrical version actually showed Butch Cavendish eating the heart; the DVD wisely shot around that. I gave it an 8 for the comedy, a tight script and solid performances from Depp, Hammer, Wilkinson and Helena Bonham-Carter. True, they could have tightened the editing a bit, but the pace reminded me much of the classic old westerns. Perhaps some of Depp's new adopted Comanche brothers felt he was exploiting them and put a curse on his career. But I don't see cause for the animosity thrown at this film. It's full of old movie references (killer rabbits, anyone?). It has an intelligent script, plenty of cartoonish violence and a few lovely, moving moments. It's great, popcorn fun and the critics absolutely buried it. Again, I ask why?",The Lone Ranger

I have now seen it twice, and enjoyed it even better the second time. I will enjoy it every time I watch it. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job re-creating Tonto. Armand Hammer was also super terrific. Depp has a magical way of inviting you into the movie, like you are there with him. He is a very funny character with a great command of acting. The special effects, stunts, and especially the music in this were incredible. I will see it over and over. I really liked the fact that this movie incorporated some history into it, along with some fictional history. There are several very funny scenes where you will find yourself laughing hysterically. Other times you will feel what the characters are feeling, and sympathize with them.",The Lone Ranger

While reminding me of the original TV series that I watched as a child, having the story center more around Tonto and including a few more adult situations freshened this old familiar tale. Though I don't feel qualified to review a film, I wanted to add my two cents worth on something I would have done differently. I actually watch a movies ending film credits and these were hard to read against a natural backdrop of Tonto plodding off into the distance, which was strange and inaccurate in itself. The film could have switched back and forth from a black screen with white letters and then back to show Tonto's progress. Then, after all the credits, showing Tonto in the far distance, the front legs of a white horse could have stopped just inside the frame. Overhead the crow flies into the scene soaring back and forth while heading toward Tonto. Then, a single trumpet plays the intro to the William Tell Overture, slowly, hauntingly, but stops a few bars before the chorus where the last note is held for a few seconds and allowed to fade to silence.

Hey kids ever heard your parents talking about cowboy and Indian films and thought it all sounded like a bunch of boring trash? Well think again!!! Disney have brought you their second most exciting film ever, right after Frozen. No just kidding. This film brings back Cowboys and Indians in the most exciting way you have ever seen them. It was made for an audience of age 12 and up, there is a little bit of gore and a lot of violence but nothing too bad.Most of the film is action. With a range of explosions, shootings and fights it is great for action lovers (and others). As well as action it has humour and great acting. It was a very well made film and i believe it has been massively under rated. The Lone ranger is great and i recommend you watch it. It is truly the Wildest film in the West.",The Lone Ranger

Accept these words from my mouth and go see ""The Lone Ranger."" I took my three young boys, 11 and under, who went grudgingly because they thought of it as a dad movie. But for two and a half hours, they were into it, on the edge of their seats. It's a film of atonement for treatment of the Native Americans in other films. Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer are great together. William Fichtner's villain makes Heath Ledger's Joker seem like Mr. Rogers. It's got a nice balance of mysticism and goofball humor and it's ridiculously thrilling. A half hour into the film, my 8-year-old turned to me and said, ""I'm going to be the Lone Ranger for Halloween."" Later on, he said, ""That was the best theater movie *ever.*"" And when your hear the first notes of ""The William Tell Overture,"" you think (at least I did), ""That's why I love the movies."" Roger Ebert would always look at a film and judge it not against an impossible standard, but by what it aspired to be. This aspired to be a great popcorn movie, and I think Roger would have liked it, even if the filmmakers did move Monument Valley to Texas. Lighten up! It's a movie!",The Lone Ranger

I especially like the interplay between the characters of ""Dan Reid"" and ""Tonto."" Both Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp are excellent actors who can get subtleties and humor just right. And I love to hate William Finchter. The last 45 minutes are spectacular! Good job! I hope the negative reviews don't deter this team from getting together for more movies.

I played with Lone Ranger toys 35 years ago!!!!! It was part of my dearest childhood memories!!!!! They didn't have the right to transform Lone Ranger and Tonto in such ridiculous characters!!!!!

When there joining the railway where the music starts is probably the best scene in the movie, it gets ridiculous but its a good action scene and one of the best ending to a film I have seen.It might be a weird film but a very enjoyable watch, personally this is now one of my favorite films.

Spending a couple of hundred million to make 'Lone Ranger' might have been an unfortunate commercial decision, but it's given us a timely and very modern update of an old formula western that outshines the original in every category, as current technology allows. Tonto tells the story of the Lone Ranger, a hero always, but one who grows in depth as the movie progresses. Johnny Depp is magnificent as Tonto, a wise man who knows what's going on and does his best to make sure his Lone Ranger doesn't make too many mistakes. The action's fast, frequent and fun to watch. The baddies are our old favorites, the goodies are often a bit questionable, and the references to great westerns of the past are as obvious as they are enjoyable. Even on the third viewing there were lots of nuances that I picked up and gave me even more pleasure from what I consider a great tribute to the heroes of my movie-going past. So it didn't repay its costs - that doesn't make it any less worth watching. Ignore the critics and rate it for yourself. Hope you love it like I do!",The Lone Ranger

Not to mention great casting and actors who are enjoying creating their characters.Gore Verbinsky's vision for this movie is both a homage to the traditional western and an action movie on par with his pirate films. I liked the script very much because, even though the movie is told as a flashback, details that advance the story are revealed cleverly, both in the ""present day"" narrative and flashback remembrances.After reading some of the ""professional"" reviews, I had low expectations for this film.

From the self-righteous main character that will frustrate you throughout the movie with his constantly idiotic decisions, to the action scenes taken straight from an episode of Duck Tales, there really is nothing to hold this movie together. The script is laughable, it's filled with clichés, and it's far too long. I did watch the whole movie, and I found myself hoping the bad guys would just kill the stupid main cast after the first hour so it could all end. One thing is for sure, this was a waste of an otherwise nice evening, and a couple of hours of my life that I will never get back.

I have a sweet spot for westerns and western-style movies, and this particular movie had that western vibe, while also feeling weirdly, but truly, Disney. It had the comedy that the family will love, the action that keeps you glued to the screen, and the character development that brings it all home. It was a wonderful watch for my family, consisting of middle-aged parents, two college kids, and two tweens. Disney PG-13 never fails.

I had fun, laughed, watching at home, i regret not seeing this on Theaters. I agree now with what Hammer said about the criticism: ""If you go back and read the negative reviews, most of them aren't about the content of the movie, but more what's behind it. It's got to the point with American critics where if you're not as smart as Plato, your stupid. That seems like a sad way to live your life."" The plot is a little silly, but that what you expect watching a classic radio show turned movie, the action is as plausible as everything you expect to see in action movies these days, but they make fun of it and i thought this was funny.A great movie to watch with family, even tho i would not recommend for children due to some violence parts",The Lone Ranger

The whole point of this is escapism and humour with mild peril - they have done exactly the same as they did with Pirates - they had fun. No deep message, no historical treatise just fun.The humour was spot on, irreverent and unexpected and the two leads play off each other brilliantly. Plenty criticism has come about negative depictions of America or of Indians but please - it's a Disney Movie. It's like complaining that Bambi gave bad press to gun owners...Hope this makes a ton of money in the future and becomes a well loved classic.Hi Ho Silver etc etc",The Lone Ranger
766,frodozilla,Another childhood memory goes up in flames at the hands of modern Hollywood!,1,7 July 2013,"Two words can describe this monumental piece of CGI excrement: Dumpster Fire!For those of you that don't get it, hot garbage...or the act of watching other people's refuse burn into ashes. Johnny Depp, stay in France, Disney, stick to ruining Star Wars with George Lucas...I cannot condemn this movie enough.I actually enjoyed the 1981 version of the Lone Ranger, why couldn't these talentless hacks look to that movie for ideas. There is so much to steal there, I don't understand why they allowed the current manifestation of their film (aka-late term abortion) to ever see the big screen.",The Lone Ranger
767,maherrich,Great movie for the whole family,10,10 October 2013,"This is my favorite movie of the summer and one of the best in this year IMHO which I wasn't expecting it to be that good after seeing the ratings and reviews. Johny Depp was extraordinary as usual and stole the light from the Lone Ranger with his great acting performance and expressions.The comedy was so funny in the movie and mixed with great entertaining action scenes. The story was good and full of adventure and surprises though I didn't read about the Lone Ranger before. The filming locations and the scenery were great for a western adventure movie. The other characters in the movie were good, specially Butch who looked creepy. The music was simply awesome and was really good for the movie atmosphere and that's what you expect from Hans Zimmer.The movie is superb and suitable for the whole family. I enjoyed it a lot and didn't feel the time passing though it's a long movie.",The Lone Ranger
768,jlg-77133,Worst Disney movie.,1,5 December 2019,Not worth the time to watch. I grew up with the Lone Ranger. This movie is old enough for me to believe the morons that green lit this no longer have anything to do with Disney.,The Lone Ranger
769,joncon56,High action packed borefest!,3,11 July 2013,This movie is the most action packed and yet tiresomely boring film I have ever seen. That is NOT an achievement! The movie breaks down like this: The Bad Guys: Industrial progress run by rich white men who are not above mass murder as a means of achieving their ends. The Good Guys: The Lone Ranger and Tonto who use destructive means to hit back at the destructive means of the Bad Guys in the hope of bringing some consolation to the aggrieved. It all felt like industrial progress was on trial and the way to fix it is to destroy it. Like watching the unending tit-for-tat of the Israelis and the Palestinians and somehow thinking one side will eventually win out. Are you kidding??? 3 stars for some entertaining cgi.,The Lone Ranger
