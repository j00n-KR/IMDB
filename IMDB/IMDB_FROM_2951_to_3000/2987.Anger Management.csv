0,MartinHafer,A bit ridiculous...but it has its moments,6,19 June 2012,"""Anger Management"" is a highly uneven film that seems ridiculously improbable. However, despite this, it's enjoyable and worth seeing--mostly due to the strange yet engaging work by Jack Nicholson.The film begins with Adam Sandler playing a complete wuss. He lets his co-workers walk all over him and he will never stand up for himself. Oddly, however, after a very minor incident in an airplane (during which time he did NOTHING wrong), he's arrested and labeled as an angry man! And, as a result, he's sentenced to an anger control program led by Nicholson. However, it soon becomes apparent that Nicholson is a crazy sociopath. Instead of helping Sandler, through the course of the film he makes his life hellish. And, whenever you think Nicholson can't push his poor patient any further, he does--stealing his girlfriend and getting him repeatedly arrested for MORE supposed outbursts. What gives?! The plot is, when you think about it, totally improbable and stupid--more so than even films like Sandler's ""The Water Boy""! The ending makes no sense at all (it does NOT explain so much you've seen through the course of the film) and Sandler isn't particularly distinguished in the movie. He's just too wimpy and unappealing most of the time and seems a bit lost. But, in a supporting role, Nicholson steals the film and makes it all worth your time. My only advice is that if you watch it, turn off your brain and especially try not to think during the last 10 minutes!! By the way, while funny, many of the supporting characters made no sense at all and were NOT explained by the funny 'twist' ending. However the odd cameo with Woody Harrelson was pretty good. The John C. Reilly scene started out well, but soon became repellent--with jokes about a mentally ill sister that are about as funny as cancer.",Anger Management
1,TheLittleSongbird,Better than I anticipated,7,15 July 2011,"I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, I find he is good in the more dramatic films(Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me are his best performances to me) and save a few exceptions(Spanglish, The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore) I find him irritating in comedy. However, Anger Management is one of the exceptions, Sandler is quite good here but Jack Nicholson outshines him. The script is funny likewise with most of the gags(the describing-who-he-is scene), the story intriguing, the pace snappy in the first two thirds and the characters fairly likable. What lets Anger Management though are one or two scenes that don't quite work such as the basketball scene and a final third that is not only a little draggy compared to the first two-thirds but rather clichéd and cheesy too. Overall, entertaining and a better film than I anticipated. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Anger Management
2,SnoopyStyle,Infuriating,2,4 May 2014,"Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is a doormat that everybody steps on. Ever since a childhood trauma, he loathes PDA even now with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei). On a flight, he is arrested for an outburst that only appears to the characters in the movie. Nobody in their right mind in the real world would see it. He is sentenced to anger management with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) who was actually the jerk sitting next to him on the plane. The anger group is full of crazies like super angry Chuck (John Turturro), Lou (Luis Guzmán), and lesbian porn stars Stacy (Krista Allen) and Gina (January Jones). After a bar fight started by Chuck gone wrong, Dave who was actually trying to stop the fight gets into more trouble. He is sentenced to 30 days of intensive therapy with Dr Rydell or else one year in the state pen. The treatment gets more and more ridiculous angering him more and more. Dr Rydell even starts dating Linda. Is he in an alternate universe? Is he in a Truman show? Is Dr Rydell the devil? Those are the questions among others that I kept asking. A good movie allows the audience to walk in the protagonist's shoes. And that's what I did with Dave. Every time people act like they're clueless to reality, it infuriated me. Every time Dr Rydell pushes Dave, it infuriated me. The point of the movie is to make Dave angry. Mission Accomplished. It made me angry. The movie annoyed the heck out of me. I would have made Jack Nicholson the devil, and this would be more fitting as a trial like Job's. The ending try to explain the story. By then, I didn't really care. The only way I can see the jokes working is if I can enjoy hurting Dave.",Anger Management
3,Prismark10,Get angry,6,23 November 2013,"A childhood incident with the school bully leaves Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) with a lasting trauma about public affection, as well as repressing his emotions.He is meek, mild mannered and works for an abusive boss. His girlfriend still has a cordial relationship with her ex and Dave takes it all.While on a business flight Dave loses his temper when he sits next to an annoying man called Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson.) He upsets a sky marshall, gets arrested and sentenced to anger management therapy operated by Dr Buddy Rydell who is unorthodox to say the least.It is revealed that Dave's girlfriend and Dr Rydell have set all this up to deal with Dave's emotional issues and release his anger in manageable ways rather than keeping it all zipped in.This is a mixed up film especially since Sandler was known for being the angry guy in his early comedy films. Here he is rather mild being harassed by Joker Jack who is obnoxious and is the one getting the laughs.You can sympathise why Sandler reaches breaking point and yet he ends up in even more trouble.Nicholson seems to be having fun and Sandler bounces off well with him. It seems obvious that Sandler has decided to play second fiddle to Nicholson and let him have the comedy limelight.",Anger Management
4,claudio_carvalho,Lovely Conclusion of a Silly Plot,7,2 October 2004,"In New York, Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is a competent executive, but living with a great trauma from his childhood in Brooklyn that made him a very unsecured man. He is not able to kiss his girl friend Linda (Maria Tomei) in public or fight for a promotion in his job, and is stepped by everybody everywhere. In a business flight, he sits on the corridor chair side-by-side with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) and a minor incident with the flight attendant sends him to the court. Judge Brenda Daniels (Lynne Thigpen in her last movie) sentences him to an intensive anger treatment with Dr. Rydell, and his life turns upside-down. I was watching this movie and telling to myself: 'What a silly storyline!'. However, the lovely conclusion when the situations are explained, made me like this film. Although being thirty nine years old, Marisa Tomei is so lovely and beautiful as in 'My Cousin Vinny'. There is a message to Lynne Thigpen, who died before the conclusion of the movie, in the end of the credits. I am a fan of Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Luiz Guzmán, and all of them have funny performances. A great entertainment indicated for laughing. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Tratamento de Choque' (Shock Treatment)",Anger Management
5,kosmasp,Good Management,6,5 October 2010,"This movie works especially because of Jack Nicholson. The gravitas he brings into his role (especially considering the really crazy things he's doing here) helps a lot improve a not perfect script. And even if some inconsistencies are explained (the airplane ""incident""), it still would not make a lot of sense.It actually doesn't. But with Jack, you just bare with it/him and suspend your disbelief, just like that. Of course many will watch it (or have so), because of Adam S. I myself am not the biggest fan of his ""comedy"" work. Though I have to say I loved him in some dramas he did. Here it seems, he get pulled into the movie by Jack, who has complete control of the movie ...",Anger Management
6,classicsoncall,"""Beware the fury of the patient man.""",7,27 June 2021,"Without too much of a stretch, almost anyone could find themselves in the same place as Adam Sandler's character here, sitting quietly in an airplane seat and getting sucked into a situation that spirals out of control because of the actions of others. Once that happens you're at the mercy of authorities that take the word of specialists who can seal your fate. I got a kick out of the pairing of Dave Buznik (Sandler) and the therapy session guy Chuck (John Turturro) as anger allies. Together they were Chuck and Dave, just like in that Beatles song 'When I'm Sixty-four'; go ahead, check it out.What I think I liked the most here were the handful of cameos. John McEnroe showing up in Buddy Rydell's (jack Nicholson) Anger Management session was a hoot for anyone following his outbursts on the tennis court when he was a high profile player. It was easy enough to spot Woody Harrelson in the drag outfit, and Rudy Giuliani showing up at that baseball game just a couple years after his term as New York City Mayor ended and while he still had juice, that was a hoot. Not so much anymore, but that's the way it goes sometimes.The story here is kind of predictable, with Dave making that heroic speech to win back his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) between innings to close out the story. You kind of knew that Nicholson's character couldn't be that much of a cad, though he did have you thinking about it. The only thing is, I have no idea what that whole 'goosfraba' thing was all about.",Anger Management
7,gavin6942,Decent Sandler Comedy,7,11 February 2016,"Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is a businessman who is wrongly sentenced to an anger-management program, where he meets an aggressive instructor (Jack Nicholson).Sandler has a special kind of humor, and it is one that has matured over the years. His classics will always be ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison"", but his follow-ups are pretty decent, too. This one has all the things we enjoy -- the juvenile humor, the excellent ensemble cast -- and adds in Jack Nicholson, so rarely ever makes a bad film.One thing about Sandler's films is that he tends to keep the same ensemble but rotates the leading lady (other than Drew Barrymore). This time we have Marisa Tomei, which is a stroke of genius. Obviously she knows comedy (My Cousin Vinny), but has branched out to some serious drama. In this film, she straddles both and rally grounds the humor. Her character is indispensable.",Anger Management
8,lee_eisenberg,mad about you,8,20 May 2006,"Mostly silly, with Adam Sandler doing his usual goofy stuff, but Jack Nicholson - looking like Orson Welles - gives the movie exactly what it needs. There are some scenes that we expect in an Adam Sandler movie (e.g., someone eventually exposes something embarrassing about himself), but other parts really hit you. The whole ""I Feel Pretty"" sequence was a real surprise. And of course, there's some great lines, especially the ""phobe"" scene. Also starring Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Rudy Giuliani (yes, THAT Rudy Giuliani).So, in conclusion, I don't feel angry at all after watching this. In fact, I feel pretty. A real hoot.",Anger Management
9,jboothmillard,Anger Management,4,2 November 2006,"I remember seeing this film once, I was unsure what to think of it by the end, and not remembering any of it, besides the scene seeing the reason for the film's plot, I thought I should watch it again, from director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard). Basically mild mannered, overworked and undervalued New York pet clothing company businessman Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) has an out of nowhere misunderstanding on a plane, where he is told by the stewardess and other staff members to calm down, despite showing no real aggression. The situation escalated after being accused of being angry, and he is wrongly sentenced to undergo anger management therapy to calm down and carry on in a normal society. He is put in the hands of the man he was sat next to on the plane, and was annoying him before the incident occurred, therapist Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), who is an eccentric character, and, despite trying to help him overcome it, seems to have a tendency to get bad tampered as well. Dave has everything in life he needs, a good job, but with boss Frank Head (Kurt Fuller) who steps on him, and loving girlfriend Linda (The Wrestler's Marisa Tomei), who tends to become really concerned for him, and these may be ""factors"" for his aggression. The relationship between him and Buddy is very tense, as he uses very unusual techniques to get over his anger, more than anything he only seems to be agitating him more and creating situations that will cause a reaction. Of course the key is for Dave to suppress his anger, but this becomes increasingly difficult when his personal life is put into the frame as well, including a point when Linda seems to leave him for his therapist. In the end though everything is alright, as it turns out the whole thing was because Linda, she was the one who set up the whole thing, starting on the plane and the meeting with Buddy, to help Dave find calmness in life, and he graduates anger management. Also starring Luis Guzmán as Lou, John Turturro as Chuck, Lynne Thigpen as Judge Brenda Daniels, Heather Graham as Kendra, Woody Harrelson as Galaxia / Security Guard Gary, American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones as Gina, John C. Reilly as Older Arnie Shankman and Harry Dean Stanton as Blind Man. Sandler is not as goof ball as he has been in past films, it is only when he gets angry that he restrains himself less, whereas Nicholson gets the opportunity to shot over him and give an interesting (questionable) performance. I can agree this film is a star power influenced thing, so that means the story suffers in the originality and any way to keep you interested, I may have giggled in one or two places, but I don't really see myself watching this again, an average comedy to watch at least once, in my opinion. Okay!",Anger Management
10,ccthemovieman-1,Low-Key Comedy Mostly Works,6,25 November 2006,"This was funny on the first viewing and a little too stupid on the second. Nevertheless, at least I got one good viewing out of this and I suspect most people would.Adam Sandler is very good as the low-key guy who gets unfairly accused of needing ""anger management"" and winds up getting it from Jack Nicholson (of all people!).This is very far-fetched and, like most comedies, gets carried away and downright stupid the final 20 minutes. However, generally-speaking, it was a fun movie to watch with the typical clichés of the day and the typical on-and-off romance angle added to the mix. The subtle and the not-so-subtle gags mostly work.In a word: fluff.",Anger Management
11,paul_haakonsen,Funny movie...,6,29 September 2012,"""Anger Management"" is, in my opinion, one of the better Adam Sandler movies so far.The story in the movie is very simple, but very interesting, especially because of the relationship between Dave Buznik (played by Adam Sandler) and Dr. Ruddy Rydell (played by Jack Nicholson) and the awkward situations that they end up in. The story is about Dave who is forced into anger management after having gone off his rocks aboard an airplane, and is stuck with the unorthodox methods of Dr. Ruddy Rydell.Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler really have great chemistry on the screen in the movie. But the movie is carried by Jack Nicholson's performance as the somewhat unique Dr. Ruddy Rydell.One of the most brilliant moments in ""Anger Management"" is when you get to see Woody Harrelson on the screen as Galaxia, that is just hilarious and off the chart. It is my favorite part of the movie, especially because Woody Harrelson took on that particular bizarre role.And also the people in the anger management group was also really a great touch to the movie, and they were hilarious.",Anger Management
12,dbdumonteil,the ruining of the potential of this story makes you look this film in anger,2,4 May 2006,"When Jack Nicholson is at his best, that is to say when he accepts to hold demeaning parts. Then, he is on a par with the greatest contemporary American actors. Besides, the twentieth first Century started under auspicious skies for him with first-class job in Sean Penn's ""the Pledge"" (2001) or ""About Schmidt"" (2002) by Alexander Payne. But when he is directed by a director who hasn't much caliber, he goes over the top, becomes unbearable and so falls in his most hateful traits. Maybe, the ""director"" Peter Segal hoped his over-the-top acting would save his flick from absolute mediocrity. A big mistake. Nicholson's exaggerated acting leaves it in here and even throws the movie off balance. His main partner Adam Sandler has great trouble to make his part count. This ""Anger Management"" is the first setback in his career which began in the 2000 decade. It's a shoddy, unfunny American movie which spans everything despicable in contemporary American comedy but Nicholson isn't totally responsible of this fiasco. It's just that he can't do anything with such an abysmal and wandering script or rather he does things one doesn't expect from him.Everything goes askew in this would-be droll comedy which shelters gross humor. It is mostly divided between either related to sex either of sheer bad taste. The scenario is written in a snap manner with lots of filler and which confuses every kind of humor. It gives the unfortunate impression of a hodgepodge and there are jerry-built dialogs which don't strike right. It also seems to me that Segal was off the point with his topic. To enable this comedy to take off, it would have been more appropriate to introduce a strained, edgy character who is unable to control his aggressive behavior and often in prey to wild mood swings. Timid attempts to define the subject give an inkling about what the film could have been if Segal had put more effort in it instead of giving it a couldn't care less treatment and also if Sandler had been able to shade his wooden acting. So, Nicholson announces to Sandler he has to stay with him in his apartment to help him to control his supposedly present anger. He wants to put mikes in Sandler's flat and has to follow him everywhere he goes including at the office. More acceptable efforts and less offbeat methods from Nicholson to help him to master his self-control would have been required. Alas, these ways are ditched and from the moment onwards when the two men go to Boston, the movie loses itself in ponderous digressions (the scene with Heather Graham in the café and then at her house and especially at the Buddhist garden). By the way, so it's the very first sequence we see at the beginning of the film which would be responsible for Sandler 's supposedly concealed anger. Sorry, Mr Segal but I don't think it holds water and I also find the argument provided by Nicholson to protract Sandler's anger therapy (the example of the female checker) unconvincing to a fault.Also one of the major flaws of ""Anger Management"" is Adam Sandler. He's bland as one could wish and so tantrums in an acting of this kind aren't his bag. It's virtually impossible to believe that he was aggressive towards the stewardess in the plane at the beginning of the film. Besides, we don't properly see the famous sequence.In this spate of mediocrity, there is one potable sequence which gives an idea about the adequate direction the film could have taken. David is late for work and drives as fast as he can. But Nicholson is in the car and abruptly stops the car. Sandler is uptight, in anger and his doctor proposes him to sing ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story"" and it works well for two reasons: Sandler finds his calmness again and things are looking good... for a short-term effect alas! Afterwards, it's the slump again until the end which reserves a surprise. Because ""c'est à la mode"", Segal inserted an unexpected twist to justify Sandler's therapy but it's so far-fetched that it makes the film null.It also hurts to see commendable actors like John Turturro as cameos in unworthy parts of their talent unless they wanted to have a good time. And don't be fooled by the cover. Nicholson and Sandler facing and yelling at each other. If my memory serves me well, there is only one sequence of this kind in the whole film.1h45 of tomfoolery. Sequences dovetailed in an artificial way. This is dreadful stuff and American comedy plumbers. A pox on it.",Anger Management
13,Quinoa1984,"Nothing awesome, but certainly a funny movie",6,8 May 2003,"At first, Dave Buznik, played by Adam Sandler, is a slightly more meek version of past Sandler psycho-funny-men.  After a ridiculous incident on an airplane involving a headset, he is assigned by the courts for anger management therapy in New York under Dr. Buddy Rydel (Nicholson, in a role that has it's peaks and valleys, more or less depending on the viewer's perspective).  When Dr. Rydel reveals his own psychotic tendencies and mannerisms, Dave's tolerance is worn down to a nub, and shows signs of the man we remember from Happy Gilmore.Anger Management is far from being the best work of either of the lead actors.  At times, their chemistry comes through, in particular from Nicholson's constant precision to the quality of the material, but for the most part they aren't utlilized to the best of their abilities (the script is equally under question).  Those who aren't interested in seeing Sandler and Nicholson in these types of crazed, demented, off-the-wall performances might be hesitant.  However, as those who saw last year's About Schmidt and Punch-Drunk Love may know, viewers can count on an intriguing, more often than not hilarious combination from actors with such range and scope.  And, this is the only movie where you'll see ex-mayor Rudy Giulliani say the Schneider line ""You can do it!"".  Other cameos include John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Woody Harrellson, many NY Yankee players, and the usual character actors from past Sandler movies.  B+",Anger Management
14,michaelRokeefe,Someone needs help...but who?,3,11 April 2004,"Well, well, well! Peter Segal directs another patient/doctor relationship flick. WHAT ABOUT BOB! is ten times better than this intended comedy about a mild-mannered business man(Adam Sandler)being wrongly accused of a crime that requires court ordered enrollment in anger management therapy. Sandler suddenly discovers that his therapist(Jack Nicholson)has his own problems dealing with anger...a serious problem. The somewhat puzzled Sandler is shadowed by his funny but psycho doctor who purposely puts his patient behind the eight ball in order to observe reactions with indifference. Stress under fire should have the reluctant patient approaching ""basket case"" status. Crude sexual content and language serve as glue to hold this story together. Of course Nicholson should really have the credit of making this a movie albeit a mediocre movie.

However, Dave's group therapy sessions with a handful of truly disturbed individuals among them jumpy ex-con Chuck, obsessive sports fan Nate, slow-burning Lou, egocentric Andrew, and bisexual porn stars Gina and Stacy leave him far more unsettled than when he arrived. Later, when Buddy decides to move into Dave's home for intensive therapy, he soon discovers Buddy has more than a bit of his own anger to resolve, and that no one brings out Dave's deeply buried inner rage quite like Buddy.Thought not without its funny moments, Anger Management is ultimately stale and disappointingly one-note, especially considering its capable cast.Both Sandler and Nicholson aren't doing anything we haven't seen from them before, but it's an undeniably fun movie.But nevertheless,it is delightful and funny nonsense of a movie.",Anger Management

The story is phony, the love story between the main characters is phony, the script is so hard to believe, as was the last Sandler film, Punch Drunk Love. The waste of talent on this film is bizarre.

How about the actors of the stature of John Turturro, Luis Guzman, Woody Harrelson, what are they doing in this dud?Oh well, then there is Adam Sandler. Could anyone tell me if he ever took acting lessons, or if what we see on screen is the comic genius they are telling us he is.? This man doesn't ever register any emotion. He face is a blank.

19,ferguson-6,I feel pretty,6,14 April 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Adam Sandler proved in last year's ""Punch Drunk Love"" that he is now an actor rather than a sideshow.  His progression continues in this at times funny, but mostly ridiculous comedy. Teaming with Nicholson, who is as over the top as he has been in a while (quite a variance from last year's outstanding ""About Schmidt""), the two take us on a ride of laughter and outlandish behavior.  The film often is secondary to the many brief appearances of celebs throughout.  Most are credited and some are pretty funny - Woody Harrelson, John C. Riley, and Heather Graham are the best.  Director Peter Segal (""Nutty Professor - The Klumps"", ""Tommy Boy"") is still trying to find his comedy legs.  Still a few too many close-ups and the romantic scenes are pretty weak.  Biggest complaint is trying to understand why the beautiful and charming Marisa Tomei would have any interest in this chicken-hearted loser in the first place?

He will land in court after a misunderstanding with a stewardess. He is ordered to seek anger management with Nicholson as the psychiatrist. He moves in with Sandler after an outburst at a bar. Homophobic jokes and a series of meddling situations with Sandler's girlfriend follow. Conclusion fails because one wonders if Sandler needed anger management or the nerve to propose to his girlfriend in public. Directed by Peter Segal who made the much funnier The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. Sandler is the ideal foil but is reduced to a series of pointless situations to push him to the limits. Nicholson is in his element but his methods seem unrealistic. It isn't difficult to guess whether he succeeds or not. Marisa Tomei is flat as Sandler's girlfriend. Supporting cameos steal their moments including John C. Reilly who appears as high school bully turn monk but the handling of this situation is enough to make anybody angry.

John Turturro is excellent! Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly & Heather Graham, are very good in brief cameos. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Anger Management' is an out-and-out entertainer, that raises the correct amount of laughs, it promises to deliver. Thumbs Up!",Anger Management
25,StevePulaski,Mr. Miyagi would question Buddy Rydall's tactics,4,2 October 2013,"Because Anger Management erects itself off of the building blocks of comedy, has two committed stars on hand - one a legend, the other the owner of his own film company - and has the benefit of a director and writer who specialize in the comedy field, it would've been fair to assume this would be a fairly fun film in many regards. Unfortunately, the film is clumsily plotted, frequently mean-spirited, redundantly conducted, and mawkishly concluded in, again, an attempt from Adam Sandler and company to get us to laugh at the desperate while simultaneously lowering our own personal standards for acceptable humor.Sandler is Dave, a white-collar man who has worked hard every day of his life and has a secure financial feature with his attractive girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei). One day, however, on a flight one day, Dave finds his seat taken and is forced to sit next to a disruptive codger with no sense of respect for the people around him. The man is watching a movie and when Dave requests a pair of headsets he is met with consistently being ignored by the stewardess and the manager who insist he is being angry and demanding. This frustration, and the stewardess's accusations of such, result in Dave verbally and physically (on accident) assaulting the woman.A court hearing states that Dave must complete twenty hours of anger management, which results in the utterly expected joke of Dave reacting to this decision with anger. When Dave attends the first lesson, he meets Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), an acclaimed author and therapist who coincidentally happens to be the man Dave sat next to on that faithful flight. Their first meet is somewhat successful, but after being assigned an ""anger buddy,"" Dave finds himself in a royal misunderstanding with his partner at a restaurant, sentencing him to a full month in the program.However, Buddy's practices are unconventional. I'd acquaint them to Mr. Miyagi's practices for young Daniel in the original Karate Kid. The difference was they amounted to something in the end, while Buddy's practices, even when given an explanation by him, seem nothing show of inconveniences in Dave's otherwise normal life. They don't feel like a matter of assistance; they feel like nuisances to him and desperate ploys on the audience to make us laugh.I return to my state that Anger Management is erected off of the building blocks of comedy. Think about one of your favorite comedies and what it involved, or just think about some comedies in general. Many stem from a character doing something they do not want to do, they don't feel comfortable doing, or something along these lines. Anger Management's plot deals with this and, based off that alone, should work as a comedic exercise. However, consider Curb Your Enthusiasm, the long-running HBO program that I label a work of Television brilliance. The show works powerfully because it is predicated off of a foundation involving a character who doesn't want to do something or has gotten himself in a ridiculous scenario. Curb Your Enthusiasm works because it puts pacing and thought into its scenarios - all the more commendable for being improvised - and invites wit and subtleties based on etiquette, traditional behavior, and ethical dilemmas, it gets a higher rating in my book than Anger Management.The mistake Anger Management makes is it pulverizes all notions and possibilities of humor directly from its approach, which is childish, slapsticky, and predictable. Sandler gives about the umpteenth rendition of the average Joe character and Jack Nicholson is given little to do with such a wacky character. Add Woody Harrelson as a cross-dressing prostitute and Heather Graham as an emotionally-fragile date and you see the levels of this film's humor.My optimism for the future is that we'll look onto films like Anger Management years from now and question why we found such subpar material amusing in a fashion akin to the way those question how people decades past found The Blob so frightening. I, too, hope that one day we'll also evolve past the cutesy, awe-inspiring ending after the previous hour and a half provided us with mean-spirited acts of trickery and nonsensical setups Mr. Miyagi would roll his eyes at and question.Starring: Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei, Woody Harrelson, and Heather Graham. Directed by: Peter Segal.",Anger Management
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Jack definitely takes over Sandler, Anger Management is good for a few laughs",7,23 November 2003,"I saw this movie in the theater with my father and I have to say even though Sandler can annoy me most of the time, this is one of his better comedies. I think he owes that to Jack Nicholson's performance, since Jack can carry a film so well he also makes the jokes into perfect cues and great laughs. Adam does a good job as well, both actors worked very well together and actually have great chemistry. I think everyone would agree that their version of ""I feel pretty"" was just so awesome and beyond hilarious. It was also nice to see that this wasn't a typical Sandler film filled with predictable cameo's of his friends, so it showed that he could carry the film without doing the common predictability.Dave is a man who designs cat suits for fat cats, he has a beautiful girlfriend, Linda, and seems to have it together, only he's actually pretty taken advantage of by his boss and Linda's ex boyfriend. He lets a lot of things go. One day when he is on a plane, he is accused of ""assulting"" a flight attendant and racist marks, despite the situation actually being the opposite. But he is sent to anger management anyways and is being mentored by Dr. Buddy Rydell, a bit of a psychotic, but this proves Dave's ""internal"" anger and turns out to prove that Dave does need help and who might be crazier in life.Anger Management is sometimes a bit silly, but I love this comedy, it's always good for so many laughs. Buddy was just so awesome in that scene where he has to pull his car out of the parking spot, but there is another car blocking him and he just handles it ""his way"", you'll have to see. Adam and Jack were great together and I would recommend this film for anyone. Like I said, it's not a typical Sandler film and really works well.7/10",Anger Management
27,=G=,Just more Sandler,5,19 September 2003,"""Anger Management"" takes the mechanical one-dimensional deadpan Sandler back out of the can for another outing as a dufus who is sentenced by a judge to an anger management course. This uninspired conglomerated mass production mess of a movie sticks Sandler in the usual absurd and exaggerated situations, surrounds him with some real talent (Nicholson, Tomei, etc.), tosses in everything but the kitchen sink (Giuliani, Merril, etc.) to give the illusion of quality comedy and then dies a slow death on screen. I found myself looking at the elapsed time on the DVD player after 25 minutes of watching Nicholson wearing out his ""The Shining"" face and Tomei trying not to look too much out of place. Passable stuff for everyone by diehard Sandler fans. (C+)",Anger Management
28,blanbrn,"Jack you get better with age, a good and funny tag team comedy with Sandler.",8,20 April 2007,"I remember seeing this at the movies twice in 2003 once with my dad the other time by myself, and each time just like the many times I view it now I find it still very entertaining and funny! Anything with the king in it that's right Jack is the king of film is a must watch, and he's OK in comedy as he's helped out greatly in this film by one of the comedy kings Adam Sandler the chemistry between Jack and Adam is just great.The plot of this movie is well done and very funny you have Adam Sandler as a loser pet products salesman who has a misunderstanding aboard an airplane, (which as you later find out is all a setup) and he's ordered to undergo anger management counseling by a specialist named Dr. Buddy Rydell(Jack Nicholson) now the fun begins because Buddy has a very aggressive approach of therapy from unorthodox treatments of sleeping in the nude, odd sayings in place of anger words, going into bars to pick up hot babes, to getting approached by a transvestite hooker, to getting revenge on old enemies of the past. All of this is so funny too as you watch time after time the Sandler character be put to test and he has to control his anger the best he can. Dr. Buddy Rydell is so smooth and clear as Nicholson plays this role to perfection. And his screen time with Adam works so well because when you put together the comedy and intelligence of the two each scene just sparkles.Also the supporting cast is good Marisa Tomei is just so wonderful and cute as Adam's girlfriend who finally finds love in the end. Some of the most memorable scenes are Woody Harrelson's tease as a transvestite hooker, and Heather Graham's scene of trying to seduce Adam's character in a Boston Red Soxs bra and panties when the Sandler character is a die hard Yankees fan now talk about a way to cause anger! It was such a funny scene and hard for him to turn her down, and control his anger! And in the films last part ex- NYC mayor Rudolph Giuliani has a cameo. Overall ""Anger Mangement"" is a pretty good and funny comedy well worth a watch with the legend Jack Nicholson and funny man Adam Sandler work well together the chemistry is just fine and the plot and funny moments make this one of the best comedies in a long time.",Anger Management
29,MovieAddict2016,"You'll need anger management after seeing this movie. Well, not really, but it's only so-so...",4,14 July 2003,"It's funny how buddy movies have transformed over the years. During the eighties there was a supply and demand for cop-buddy films, such as ""48 Hrs.,"" ""Red Heat,"" and even ""Turner and Hootch."" During the nineties there was a supply and demand for road comedy movies, for the most part. And now there seems to be a supply of Adam Sandler movies, with half-and-half demand. The younger crowds love him, and usually the older hoards of people despise him.In ""Anger Management,"" Sandler tries his hand at a buddy formula. It works on occassion, is at often times quite humorous, but fails to deliver what I really expected until the last thirty minutes, which finally gets some nice laughs in on a consistent basis.Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a generally peaceful young man who is flying on business. On the flight, Dave sits next to Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), an obnoxious loudmouth (or so it appears at first glance) who insists that Dave should watch the in-flight movie Buddy himself is watching. Dave asks a flight attendant for a set of headphones, the stewardess starts chatting up a friend, the headphones never come. Dave asks again, and suddenly the stewardess is asking him not to yell. The next thing he knows, he's in an anger management program for assaulting a flight attendant, even though he simply touched her arm to stop her from walking away down the aisle, ignoring him.Big surprise for Dave when he finds out the anger management program is run by Buddy Rydell, who invites Dave to an anger group, comprised of Chuck (John Turturro), a crazy man who believes everyone hates him, Lou (Luis Guzman), who is gay, and two female lovers. Dave, who is not angry nor crazy, starts to think everyone else is, as Buddy moves into his apartment and even follows him to work. This of course gets in the way of his relationship with his girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei), who says they need to have some ""time apart."" You can expect what happens in the rest of the film.I was disappointed in this film overall. The first thirty minutes were painfully unfunny and predictable. The end somewhat redeems itself, but still doesn't make the film as great as it could have been given the potential.The cast is stellar, ranging from Nicholson to Kevin Nealon to an uncredited cameo by Heather Graham. I found it humorous that most of the cast has been in P.T. Anderson's films: Heather Graham, Luis Guzman, and Adam Sandler have all been in at least one of Anderson's films.But a great cast cannot always save a movie, and though ""Anger Management"" has a lot going for it, the film itself fails to go where it should. I actually DO like Adam Sandler, but this movie was unfortunately just so-so and nothing more.John Ulmer**1/2 out of *****",Anger Management
30,OllieSuave-007,"OK comedy, not great.",6,14 January 2014,"This is a comedy starring Adam Sandler, who plays a businessman wrongly sentenced to an anger-management program, where he meets aggressive instructor Buddy Rydell, played by Jack Nicholson. I saw this movie once, on a plane. It was an OK movie to pass the time during the jet ride. There are campy scenes at the expense of Sandler and the overly crazy Nicholson, mixing in to provide us with a mildly entertaining film. Marisa Tomei provided a nice balance of romance and drama, serving as Sandler's love interest. The plot was OK and the overall story was serviceable; I did find the script handling dealing with one's own anger clever, resulting in the characters serving up some good laughs and puns. The plot also didn't drag on that would have made this movie boring.Aside from some of the camp and downright silly sequences, like the monk scene, this movie is worth at least one watch.

31,sddavis63,For Sandler Fans Only!,3,27 March 2004,"I was torn about watching this movie. From what I had seen of the trailers it seemed to be a movie with a lot of potential, but two things were competing inside me: I have rarely seen a movie with Jack Nicholson that I didn't like, and I have rarely seen a movie with Adam Sandler that I did like. Which pre-conceived notion would win out? In this case, the Sandler view proved the more powerful. I thought this was a pathetically weak movie, which basically matches my view of Adam Sandler's acting talents.Some people love him. Fair enough. To each his own. I find him an extremely limited, one-dimensional actor. Movie after movie, he plays basically the same pathetic loser who gets into a series of unbelievable situations and has to find a way to cope. How many times do we have to see essentially the same character and essentially the same story? Think about it. ""Happy Gilmore,"" ""Mr. Deeds,"" ""Anger Management."" The list could go on. They're all basically the same (and I didn't like any of them.) Which leads to one of two conclusions: either Sandler is hopelessly type-cast, or he really isn't capable of playing any other part. I tend to lean toward the latter, because I don't even think he plays these parts particularly well.
Anyway, if you're a Sandler fan, go for it. You'll like this, because it's like everything else he's ever done. If you're not a Sandler fan, avoid this like the plague because, well, it's like everything else he's ever done.I'm giving it a 3, just because I can't bear to rank a movie with Jack Nicholson any lower than that.",Anger Management

with a pretty good twist for a comedy",Anger Management
33,ElMaruecan82,Had the potential of a screwball comedy classic ... but took the wrong direction at the end ...,7,20 September 2012,"In my opinion, a good comedy is built on an original premise and a funny story working as the build-up for a final and hilarious punch line. And that's what lacked in Peter Segal's ""Anger Management"", a pity because some scenes were not just funny, but flirted with comedic genius.Take the moment in the plane, when Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) sits next to Dr. Buddy Rydel (Jack Nicholson), Buddy laughs so loudly at a film and asks so many embarrassing questions that Dave decides to watch the film for his own serenity. He asks the flight attendant for a headset but she ignores him, he asks her again then she tells him to keep calm. The scene works on many levels because it confirms Dave's calm and passive personality and exposes him to people who overreact for no reason. An angry Black flight's sky marshal also asks Dave to keep calm, Dave is the poor unlucky schmuck whose tongue slips and makes him say ""what's wrong with you people?"" Notice that at that moment, Buddy, the man who got him in trouble cowardly pretends to sleep. It goes on and on, Dave's asked one time too many to keep calm, Dave shouts ""I'm calm!"", the marshal immediately tasers him.This whole scene is funny from its simple premise, a poor schmuck facing people who overreact while he's obviously inoffensive, a situation that gets more and more out of control and the taser is the perfect punch line. Nothing is funnier than a man who is not angry, and asked to keep calm. I know that because I could relate to the situation. If only ""Anger Management"" kept the same pattern than this simple scene, it would have been one of the greatest comedies of the last decade. Imagine a man sentenced to anger management therapy while his biggest problem is precisely a lack of anger. The film makes it clear that Dave is abused by his boss, that he's got a beautiful girlfriend Linda but he can't kiss her in public because of his humiliation in the past and her ex-boyfriend regularly comes to tease Dave. He's pressured in every side, and we feel for him: the last thing he needs is anger management.Does he? Dave visits Buddy for one séance, he meets other 'anonymous angry' people, among them Luis Guzman, John Turturro as Chuck in a scene-stealing role and two horny lesbians. Dave plays the game and tries to answer Buddy's question ""tell us about you"" yet he never gives a proper answer, either he tells what he does, or what he expects, but he can't say who he is. The film leaves it interestingly ambiguous whether it's Buddy who pushes Dave off the edge or Dave who has an anger problem. Anyhow, Buddy delivers an implacable diagnosis: ""There are two kinds of angry people: implosive and explosive. The explosive is the customer that keeps on yelling at the cashier for not taking his coupon. The implosive is the cashier that keeps calm day after day till she snaps and murders all the people in the store. You are the cashier."" And Dave's reply couldn't have been more hilarious: ""Oh no! I'm not the cashier! I'm the guy that's hiding behind the frozen foods section dealing 911!"" And we so believe him. As soon as the flamboyant Buddy and the straight-laced Dave team up for the therapy, we feel that the film is unto something extremely promising. Acting-wise, it's obvious that Adam Sandler doesn't have the range of Jack Nicholson, but he's playing a character that lacks charisma and the one-note tone creates the perfect contrast for an 'odd couple' effect. And Dave's jinx continues to follow him: in another hilarious scene, he's involved in a bar fight provoked by Chuck and ending up with Dave hitting a poor Mexican waiter with a cane. Later, Dave explains to the judge (Lynn Thigpin in her last role) that he was just trying to take the cane from  a blind man. Poor Dave! The film is just one gag following another and when it's not funny, it makes you smile, it owes a lot to Nicholson's ability to portray half psychotic half exuberant characters, even if it does indirectly highlight Sandler's limitations at some places ... but the film could have survived that. The problem was more with the plot, while it seemed to go nowhere but still be being outrageously funny, it became desperately convention when we could see where it was going. So, the whole therapy was just a wake-up call, an invitation for Dave to overcome his fear and shyness. All it took was for Buddy to pretend to steal his fiancée and his idea of marriage proposal in the Yankee Stadium. The film opens with the premise of a slapstick buddy-movie and an enjoyable little character study, it ends as an unoriginal rom-com.And it would still have been OK if it wasn't for all the post-September 11 references and New York celebration? I mean, what the hell was Rudolf Giuliani doing there? Was the film so desperate that it needed to play at a spot-that-face game even on a political field. Don't get me wrong, the film was funny, and sometimes very funny and gripping in its won way but that was worst than the worst of product placement, the ending was just like thrown at our faces to tell us that it wasn't meant to be serious. The therapy was fake, so was the film though the 'I feel pretty' was cute in its own non-sensical way.I don't mind not taking a film seriously, and watching it just to have a good laugh at some scenes or lines, but it's a real pity a film shows so much potential and features so many hilarious lines. ""The Hangover"" didn't have a more original plot, but at least it was consistent.",Anger Management

The basic plot line is about a timid businessman who has to undergo anger management because he got ""mad"" on a plane. A scene that surprised me was when Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens play a very small part at Yankee Stadium. I was surprised because I was not expecting these two players to appear in the film.

He obviously didn't do anything so why did they make this look stupid? I've seen some of his movies and I swear, this has to be one of his films to have a messed up storyline.

37,The-Sarkologist,Nicholson & Sandler Face Off,5,31 July 2020,"I was somewhat surprised to have encountered an Adam Sandler movie where he stars beside Jack Nicholson, the reason being that I never expected this to be Nicholson's thing. In my mind he is the type of person that can pick and choose what he wants to do, and when he auditions for a role, the producers pretty much tell everybody else that their services are no longer required. Mind you, because of that, he does pretty much steal the show, even though I have to admit (and I'll probably make quite a few enemies in doing so), that I'm not a huge Nicholson fan.Anyway the story is about this rather meek guy, typical Adam Sandler character mind you, who has a problem with people pushing him around. One day he is on the plane and he is accused of causing a scene, and lands up in court where he is assigned to Anger Management classes. It turns out that Jack Nicholson is running the classes (who he also happened to be sitting next to on the plane). Of course, it does sound ridiculous that such a meek character would be sent to Anger Management, but it does eventually make sense.Still, this was a rather fun film, even though it really wasn't one of the best that I have actually seen. However, I did feel that the way it was put together was rather clever, especially with the way that Nicholson runs his course. It is certainly one of those peaches and pairs type of movies, where you have two characters that are clearly unsuited for each other being forced to have to put up with each other, though that is sort of one way considering that Nicholson knows exactly what he is doing.I guess another problem is that Nicholson does have a habit of stealing the show, but that no doubt has an awful lot to do with his presence. Still, he did play the character well, despite the style of moving being a somewhat below his talent, not that I don't like Sandler movies, but in my mind I never really equate the typical Nicholson movie with the typical Sandler movie. However, they work well together, and despite it not being a great movie, it was still rather enjoyable.",Anger Management
38,zkonedog,A Complete Mess,2,5 March 2017,"When making a movie, the producers/directors must first and foremost determine what type of project they are creating. In the case of ""Anger Management"", director Peter Segal tries to weave some semblance of emotion into the ridiculous plot of his film...and fails miserably in the effort.For a basic plot summary, ""Anger Management"" sees young, mild-mannered businessman David Buznik (Adam Sandler) being treated as the company peon despite all his hard work and career aspirations. With some prodding from girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) and a series of crazy events, Buznik begins seeing Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), an anger management therapist specializing in some rather unorthodox ""treatments"".The main problem with this movie is that one must simply face facts: it just isn't all that funny. Sandler makes a couple of his trademark wisecracks that might elicit a chuckle here and there, but Nicholson is completely wasted in a terribly annoying role. For being billed as a ""comedy"", the laughs are few and far between.What makes it a truly abysmal effort, though, is the fact that the producers had the gall to try and make it ""mean something"" towards the end. A movie this ridiculous (with characters so over- the-top as to be almost cartoonish at times) in premise cannot make the sudden switch to emotional without coming off as laughable (exactly what happens here).Overall, ""Anger Management"" was one of the most disappointing films I've seen in quite awhile. I was expecting some laughs and some great cast chemistry, but received instead a mess of a film that tries to ""pull itself together"" in the end but only ends up embarrassing itself further.",Anger Management
39,Floated2,Quite Underrated,7,6 August 2016,"Anger Management starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a 35-year-old, browbeaten executive assistant. Dave takes it all with a smile and gets on with his next humiliation with the good grace born of self-esteem so low that it doesn't even register as a blip on the radar. Until, a fateful plane trip where his self-effacing nature doesn't defuse the situation as exacerbate it. Before he knows it, he's been tasered, arrested, and sentenced to anger management classes with unconventional therapist Buddy Rydell, who just happens to be the eccentric guy who was sitting next to him on the plane. Anger Management tends to be rarely mentioned among Sandler's list of older films and in this film is a great representation of how he was during his best years. He does tend to play very similar characters but he plays (or has) played them well, and his comedic timing and deliver is on par with his better work efforts. The film succeeds because the plot is relatively decent and it works. It also does not try to hard for laughs and silly gags (like Mr. Deeds). A big part of this may be due to the script, it wasn't written by Sandler, though there are one or two fart jokes that have his fingerprints all over them.

42,Anonymous_Maxine,"I wasn't sure to expect a great comedy because Jack Nicholson was in it or a ridiculous comedy because Adam Sandler was in it, but I should have known.",6,7 May 2003,"Jack Nicholson has an endless ability to entertain, he's one of the VERY few men in Hollywood that are just fun to watch almost regardless of what movie they're in, but unfortunately he is not able to overcome Sandler's equal skills in goofy childish humor, which generally serve to dumb his movies down and challenge the audience to pretend they're not watching a kid's movie packed with bad taste.Anger Management definitely had its share of good moments, but as a whole it's one of those movies that is going to a very specific destination, and had better do something interesting along the way. The problem is that the only interesting thing it does along the way is give Adam Sandler one excuse after another to get angry, combining the hilarity of his desperate attempts to control his anger in Happy Gilmore with his sudden outbursts of gratuitous (and strangely satisfying) violence from The Waterboy.Jack Nicholson is great as the questionable anger management therapist, although I'm still not 100% sure why he signed on with what was sure to have been from the beginning just another goofy Sandler comedy, although I'm sure he had a good time making the film. Just before I saw the movie, I was getting ready to tape the MTV Icon show about Metallica, and I caught the last half or so of a show called Punk'd, that featured Brittany Spears and that guy from that one TV show, the 70's Show I think, and basically they played a lot of pranks on different people and each other in a thinly disguised Tom Green style. I normally don't watch much TV, so I was surprised to watch a few minutes of that show and then see almost exactly the same thing in Anger Management.Jack Nicholson's character in the movie was the type of anger management therapist whose therapy consists of similar tactics, playing pranks on people in order to get them to recover from their anger without even really realizing that their therapist is doing anything other than screwing with them to piss them off even more. There are plenty of tricks which would not get very far in the real world without resulting in a pile of serious lawsuits, regardless of how many judges you know. We never find out, for example, who the owner of the ill-fated Lexus was, and I'd like to hear what kind of insurance company would buy a brand new Lexus that fell off a building just because it had a business card on it. Maybe he knows some people down there, too.The therapy sessions are some of the best scenes in the movie (besides the singing parts, which were so funny that I might try them out myself the next time I get mad), but there are only two or three of them, and even those are a little contrived. John Turturro has a great role as one of the other people in the therapy group, a man who has an intense anger problem and is in constant need of help with it, and of course Sandler fans will have a blast pointing out all of the actors that turn up in all of his movies. Sadly, however, they may have more fun doing this than watching the movie.(spoilers) The end of the movie contains a brief scene that goes back and explains what was happening in key scenes, which is a universal sign of weak script-writing. Unless this is a Scooby Doo cartoon, there had better be a better way to explain to the audience what happened. In this case, the movie allows us to believe something that is obviously untrue just so the rest of the movie makes sense.For example, we are initially led to believe that the entire reason for the assignation of anger management therapy in the first place, which leads to the premise for the rest of the movie, was because of a scene on an airplane where Sandler was badly mistreated by the attendants and then assaulted by a man pretending to be a security guard, even though he was just a disgruntled passenger. If you look at the movie overall, the only message it delivers is about staying in your assigned seat on the airplane.Everything always works out a little too conveniently and according to Nicholson's dubious plan, which is occasionally accounted for only by suggesting that he knows certain people that helped his plan along, such as the judge and the radio newscasters at the baseball game. It's like The Cable Guy with anger management therapy instead of cable. I was just waiting for Sandler to try to call the police on Nicholson, only to have Nicholson grin and say to the officer, `How's that therapy working out for you?'Of course the movie ends with Sandler getting the girl in front of a whole baseball stadium full of people, as Nicholson smiles at the top of the stairway and walks off into the stadium like a guardian angel. Very cute, but hopefully no one ever took the movie as something that was meant to be taken serious at all. The way the movie eventually works out is not entirely unsatisfying in any way, despite how obviously contrived it all is, but it is just packaged a little too neatly. Most movies are packaged pretty neatly these days, but the reason this causes a problem for Anger Management is because it is a movie with such a huge amount of variables.There are so many risky stunts pulled and so many different explosive characters that it is just too much to ask us to believe that it could end not only as happily as it did, but with a whole stadium full of people cheering for our hero and his girlfriend at the end of the movie. Anger Management is not a bad date movie, but it even presses the boundaries of this genre pretty hard at some points. I am a little confused as to who exactly the target audience is for a movie like this, besides the obvious Sandler fans who will watch any movie that he comes out with (I happen to be among this group, just not the group that will love any movie that he comes out with just because he's in it), but it's unfortunate that there are so many Jack Nicholson fans (more than likely a group of people who have slightly more mature taste in movies) that are going to hate it because Nicholson's skill was not able to pull the movie away from Sandler's childishness.Sadly, the movie is something of a kid's movie that contains one too many lesbian adult film stars to be any good for the kids to watch. Evidently Sandler and his producers are operating under the firm belief that their audience has increased in age but not maturity. Anger Management is made for the kids who have grown up and now want to see what they weren't allowed to before. But hey, at least they tagged on a cute ending.",Anger Management

Adam Sandler is a happy go lucky guy who is the victim of circumstances, uptight snobbish little preppy larvae, and a ludicrous court system. Buddy completely destroys Sandler's life, completely humiliates him, and then acts like he can't be bothered. By the time Buddy Rydell's through with Sandler, you really HATE Buddy Rydell, Sandler's girlfriend, and pretty much everyone else in this movie.You know...it seems to me that a comedy would work in that it makes the audience laugh, relate, and have a joyful feeling. Now maybe I don't ""get"" this whole comedy thing, but it just seems to me that an effort deriving its financial payback from the audience (who's come expecting comedy) should not aim at ticking the audience OFF. While it's supposed to be a ""black comedy"" (and I don't like that term, so we'll call it ""dark comedy?"" though that's not much better), it really isn't funny. I have a ""dark,"" morbid, twisted sense of humor, and I did not find this dark comedy even remotely amusing. It's entertaining only in the basest way such as...watching a train wreck only because you can't make yourself remove your eyes from the bloody disaster you know is coming. Well, this does have an ending twist, but by the time it comes, it's too little too late and you're totally enraged by the whole experience.My take on this movie, is...if you don't want to need Anger Management, avoid this movie!

Adam Sandler, who was not much better, plays a catastrophic patient whom because of a myriad of bizarre circumstances is misdiagnosed as having anger management issues.

Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler are hysterical as is the colorful supporting cast. Sandler plays a seemingly mild-mannered administrative assistant who, after losing his cool with a flight attendant, is saddled with anger management guru Nicholson. Unbelievably intrusive, Nicholson literally moves in with Sandler, taking over his life, his girlfriend (a particularly effervescent Maria Tomei) and causing general mayhem. Things go from not so good to awful for the hapless Sandler. It's a really fun movie with Sandler once again surrounding himself with great cast: John Turturro and Luis Guzman as demented anger management classmates; Harry Dean Stanton as a vengeful blind man; Woody Harrelson as a German transvestite hooker; Kevin Nealon as Sandler's woefully inept lawyer. As with most of his vehicles, Sandler manages to standout amongst a very funny crew. A bunch of other notables pop up in cameos.",Anger Management

With such a good supporting cast (Woody Harrelson is very funny, my old friend from Henry Street Settlement Luis Guzman is also very funny, and I really liked John Tutturo, who plays the out of control Italian to a tee. What kept this film from being much better is too much dependence on the predictability of Sandler's character; all his films have the same sappy, sugary endings. If the producers, director and script writers had used the talented supporting cast more, it would have been a better film. Nicholson was good and had just about the right amount of screen time, but the scenes with Giuliani and the Yanks (especially with Clemens? PEDS user?) were on the verge of embarrassing and knocked the final rating to average. The ending is from hunger. Too bad, a good premise and a fine supporting cast goes to waste.",Anger Management
49,13Funbags,When will I learn???,1,24 August 2017,"A good sign that a movie is going to be bad is if the three stars haven't made a total of three good movies in their lifetimes. This is a perfect example of that theory. Sandler had Airheads and Tomei had My Cousin Vinny but neither were even the star in their lone good movies. I've never seen a Jack Nicholson movie because I value my time. A friend of mine asked me if I had seen this and by the time I figured out that she wasn't talking about the Charlie Sheen show, she had forgotten why she asked in the first place. That's another omen. But being the good friend that I am, I decided to give this thing a shot. That was possibly the worst decision I made in my life. There's no reason to even talk about the supposed plot and acting because the movie ended for me at the one minute mark. That's right. By the time they had wasted one minute of my life they had jumped the shark and raped my brain. Immediately after the words Anger Management leave the screen it says Brooklyn, 1978. Then we see a kid wearing a Dukes Of Hazzard shirt. Even though I'm immediately suspicious, I decide to at least wait to hear some dialogue. Wouldn't you know it, the first line is ""Hey Dave I like your Dukes Of Hazzard shirt"". OK, now they had forced my hand, I had to pause the movie and find out when the show started. I literally only had to type ""duk"" into the search bar here and without clicking anything I can see that the show started in 1979. That's where a smart person would have turned off this trash. If they couldn't even do the slightest amount of research for a movie that cost $75 million to make(with no special effects), how can the rest of the movie not be total trash? It can't and it wasn't.

He's no longer the idiot, but some every-man that seeks to embody the averageness of every human being. Thus, which is why Anger Management works so well. Chocked full of laughs and a usual hammy performance from Jack Nicholson, this movie proved that Adam Sandler's films are no longer pieces of crap that should have been left on the cutting room floor. It's hard to analyze this film because all it is good for is a few good laughs. So I'll leave it at that.",Anger Management

Adam Sandler does well, and exhibits some control as a guy with problems containing his rage (I'll admit...I've never seen any of his other movies).  But poor Marisa Tomei...the girl who once won an Oscar has become one-dimensional background scenery, indistinguishable from any would-be starlet.  The movie's lowbrow humor and endless parade of cameos gets tedious near the end, and from the overhead shot of a packed baseball stadium that kicks off the last act, anyone who's even half-awake will be able to predict the unforgivably sappy conclusion.

Having not been impressed with Adam Sandler's consistent refusal to play nothing more than the protagonist-who-can-do-no-wrong (where is the fun in that), I was, needless to say, disappointed with this mostly stale, moronic comedy. In a near clone of his Mr. Deeds persona, Sandler stars as an innocent, well-meaning guy who is mistakenly diagnosed as chronically angry. Diagnosis: Anger. Treatment: Counseling.Jack Nicholson tries stealing the movie with his mostly forced moments as a live-in anger management counselor, irking Sandler with his highly eccentric techniques. Imagine how funny that is? Well, what may have worked better as a properly done, cheap spoof comedy in the mid 80s, turns out to be utterly forgettable here. True, there are funny moments, mostly from the scene-stealing costars John Tuturo and Luis Guzman (above all, what were they doing in this dog of a movie?).Unless you're easily amused with most of Sandler's recent comedy fare (outside of Spanglish and the unusual Punk Drunk Love), then this is probably the ideal film for you.

Story is about Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) who is mild mannered and gets walked on by society and after an altercation on a business flight he is ordered by a judge to complete anger management therapy where he has to graduate one step at a time. Dave attends his therapy that is run by the respected Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) who's methods are unorthodox and confrontational. After another altercation in a bar Dr. Rydell moves in with Dave and follows him everywhere from work to sleeping in his bed and this drives Dave bananas. Dave's girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) convinces him that all this might be good for him but after Dr. Rydell gets a look at her he seems to start asking personal questions regarding their relationship.*****SPOILER ALERT*****After spending time together on a road trip Dr. Rydell tells Dave that he should tell Linda that they should try a trial separation and she agrees but it doesn't take long before Dr. Rydell announces that he and Linda are in love! Dave goes berserk and ends up in court again where he has a restraining order put on him but he doesn't want to lose Linda.This film is directed by Peter Segal who has a career in directing mainly unfunny comedies and he seems a logical choice to be directing Sandler films. Yes, I know that Sandler has a legion of fans and this film did make a lot of money but the script is so contrived and corny that I had to wonder if Sandler realizes that he is wasting his own talents? I'm the first to admit that he can be funny and god knows that Nicholson flashing his devilish grin can be a hoot so the premise and the casting had real potential. But instead we get Sandler getting into fights with Monks and becoming jealous of his girlfriends male friend with the extra large penis and if that isn't silly enough you have Woody Harrelson popping up as a German transvestite hooker. The film has an especially hokey ending with Sandler begging for his girlfriend to come back while in the middle of Yankee Stadium full of people cheering him on. This story had the promise of something reverent and compelling but Sandler and whoever else was involved decided to just make a silly and predictable film about nothing.",Anger Management

After Taking Abuse From His Teacher, Jack Nicholson, Prison Doesn't Sound Too Bad.",7,1 January 2006,"Meet Dave Buznik. A mild-mannered and overly passive executive designer of cat clothing. On this day he was accompanying his boss, Mr. Frank Head, to St. Louis on a business trip. When Dave boards the plane, he finds some thoughtless person has taken his seat. Fortunately there was an empty one beside a man named Buddy. Dave took it. Buddy soon got Dave interested in the movie he was watching so Dave requested a set of headphones. Unfortunately the ditzy, yuppie stewardess just seemed to ignore him. Dave kept asking, until a disgruntled air Marshall got involved. Dave wasn't actually causing a scene, but it looked to them like he was so the disgruntled Marshall used a taser on him. Amazingly the stupid stewardess claimed Dave broke her arm so he was taken to court before a biased judge. She made Dave take an anger management course. The course was taught by Buddy, or Dr. Buddy Rydell. The members of the group consisted of overly-aggressive and paranoid Chuck, showgirls who had the hots for each other Stacy and Gina, and disgruntled employees Lou and Nate. The class was uneventful for Dave who felt he didn't have a problem with anger, Buddy however sensed that Dave's anger was all on the inside, as he had a lot of loathing, self hate; After another incident where Dave accidentally breaks a cocktail waitress' nose, the judge was ready to send him up the river. Luckily Buddy intervened and offered his services. It was time for some intense training for Dave, which also meant the unthinkable must happen: Buddy would be temporarily moving in with Dave.Buddy was an obnoxious roommate. He laid down the laws with Dave, forbidding all anger inducing foods like alcohol, slippy-flippy's, trick sticks, bing bangs and flying Willard's. Buddy even accompanied a humiliated Dave to work, after making him stop in the middle of the highway and sing ""I Feel Pretty"" from West Side Story. Well, Dave's boss humiliated Dave when they arrived,and Buddy returned the favor by calling Mr. Head ""Fran""; A very well ""equipt"" co-worker, Andrew, an old friend of Dave's girlfriend, Linda, continued to hang around her, which irritated Dave, as did Buddy who continued to make his life Hell. Then one day Dave received a call from Buddy's mother in Boston who was having minor surgery. Buddy had to leave for Boston, and he ""insisted"" that Dave come along. That's also when Buddy met Linda and secretly fell head over heels for her; they arrive in Boston. Mommy was just fine, so Dave and Buddy retire to a restaurant where Buddy points out a beautiful young girl and makes Dave go flirt with her. Her name was Kendra. After they have a few drinks Kendra invites Dave to come back to her house. Dave was reluctant but when he saw Buddy had abandoned him, he had no choice.Kendra seemed like a nice girl, except she was overly-obsessed and hyper-sensitive about her weight. She had the perfect figure but thought she was fat. Dave tried telling her he already had a girlfriend but she misconstrued it as saying she was fat; Dave finally tracked down Buddy and the two head home the next day, but first they make a stop at a monastery where Dave's former childhood bully Arnie Shankman lived. He was now Buddhist monk Pana Kamanana. The two really let their emotions out. Dave had never gotten into a fist fight with a monk before. After that, they flee the monastery and return to New York. Buddy had chosen to intervene in Dave and Linda's relationship and convinced her that a trial separation would strengthen their love. Dave was willing to go along with it, until he found Linda dating Buddy! Later, Dave and Buddy get into a fight. Dave jumps Buddy, and now faces prison for attempted murder. Worse yet, Buddy was taking Linda to a Yankee game that night. Dave just knew Buddy would propose to her. So, after finally finding the strength to tell off his boss, Dave raced to Yankee Stadium and, with some encouragement from Mayor Giuliani, Dave was able to announce his true feelings for Linda, and as it turns out, Buddy did indeed propose...For Dave. Linda later reveals that the entire experience was set up by Buddy. The judge and stewardess were friends of his. Dave had now learned not to be so angry at himself, he and Linda were married, Dave and Buddy became firm friends, and they all lived happily ever after.Anger Management. What can I say? A very funny movie. Adam Sandler was funny, as usual. Jack Nicholson played his role very well. So well you love to hate Buddy. He's an obnoxious, beastly, irritating man, but somehow you still like him. Academy Award winner Marisa Tomei is here as Dave's sexy girlfriend. Adam Sandler's good friend Allen Covert is here too. Heather Graham is the ""fat"" chick. And Kevin Nealon is Dave's dim-witted lawyer; This movie was good. The monastery scene was really funny. But some parts get very annoying, like when Dave is harassed on the airplane for doing absolutely nothing. And that judge was a pill!

Here the match - Sandler at his most restrained, Nicholson getting sloppy - works very well, as each becomes a complement to the other, which is wholly in keeping with the characters and their situation. The supporting cast is also doing very well. And the film is well-made: possibly even too much so, as for instance with the cinematography, which is of a high quality that would suit a heavy dramatic film.There are definitely some laugh-out-loud high moments along the way, and very few low moments.

His is such a powerful presence that it invariably becomes a 'Jack Nicholson Movie'.Despite his appearance as second-billing in this case, he steals many - though by no means all - of the scenes. Here, many of his lines are so inadequate or just mumbled asides that there are times when even a hatstand could upstage him. Which is largely what happens, unless we assume that his dour and wooden protagonist is anything other than a prop.I found the whole thing from start to finish - or at least, to where I gave up (about 2/3 of the way through) a pretty confused affair with a series of lame jokes and preposterously contrived though still largely predictable situations. The monk in the monastery losing his temper was so inevitable that I put the kettle on whilst waiting for it to happen. They drove away in rapturous amusement, I sat down and waited for something funny.A blind man who beats people indiscriminately with his cane during a drunken brawl is going to find out pretty early in his career that it's a very big mistake. Or at least; he would in Britain.Perhaps there's the rub. American comedy doesn't necessarily translate when it crosses the Atlantic. And of course; vice-versa.Even so, any director who can create a movie that makes a formidable character like Jack Nicholson appear mediocre, really needs to review his own career.Some (American) commentators appear to have enjoyed it immensely, so perhaps I should have tried a little harder or concentrated less upon the kettle. Whatever the case, I don't intend to bother with it again. The words 'confused and mediocre' would be my first choices for its description.

If it's not enough to compensate us for the dullness felt till then at least it brings the movie's mark a few points up in my opinion.

The reason why ""Anger Management"" caught my attention was because I was familiar with the two co-stars, Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. I had seen both of them play entertaining characters in movies before, so seeing them in a film together sounded like it sure had potential. I haven't been impressed with every film I've seen Sandler in, and knew this wasn't one of the most popular comedies from the past decade, so I wasn't expecting a consistently hilarious film, but was expecting some laughs. I certainly did get those laughs, but after a while, the movie proved to be mildly disappointing.Dave Buznik works for a New York City pet clothing company, and has a mean-spirited boss named Frank Head, who tends to take credit for Dave's work. Dave has a girlfriend named Linda, but due to a traumatic childhood experience, he is afraid to kiss her in public. Since that childhood embarrassment, he has also been suppressing his emotions. On a business flight, he sits beside an irritating man named Buddy Rydell, and after a simple request from Dave leads to overreactions from the flight attendant and sky marshal, the businessman finds himself in court! He is found guilty of assaulting the flight attendant, even though he didn't, and is sentenced to twenty hours of anger management therapy. His therapist for these twenty hours happens to be Buddy Rydell! After the first session, Buddy tells Dave that he is doubling his therapy time, explaining the difference between explosive and implosive anger! It gets worse for the New York businessman when he is arrested again after accidentally hitting a waitress, and Buddy moves into his apartment to give him more intense therapy! Before either of the co-stars appears in the film, the story begins in 1978, with Dave as a kid and about to kiss a girl when his pants are pulled down by a bully named Arnie Shankman! I did not find this very funny, which was also the case with the parts of this sequence showing Arnie's sister ""losing her mind."" However, the film then skips to the present, and begins to look better. The scene showing Dave and Buddy together on the plane (Nicholson's first scene in the role of Buddy) is a very funny one, and the film sure looks promising at this point. There are lots of funny moments after this, including some involving other anger management patients, and also Buddy explaining the difference between explosive and implosive anger, but after a while, I found that the gags usually weren't funny enough to keep the film as entertaining as it looked like it was going to be. For example, I didn't care much for the scene with Galaxia, a transvestite prostitute played by Woody Harrelson. There are times when the humour may get just a LITTLE too juvenile, though modern comedies can get a LOT more juvenile than anything in this film. Later on, the film does get funnier again, maybe with the part featuring John C. Reilly as adult Arnie Shankman.This is a comedy with lots of funny moments, but it's not consistent enough to be completely satisfying. With Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson in the starring roles, it had potential to be much better. Still, I will give ""Anger Management"" credit for giving me laughs, even if they weren't usually big laughs. Judge Brenda Daniels, a character who appears in the court scenes here, is played by Lynne Thigpen, who sadly died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 54 shortly before this movie was released. Seeing her here was interesting for me because I recognized her as the one who played The Chief in ""Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?"", a TV show I saw many times as a kid in the 90's. The lead roles in this 2003 comedy are both played by very famous actors, and if you're a fan of theirs, this film could make you laugh many times, though you may also find that it could have been a lot funnier.",Anger Management
66,Stampsfightclub,Poor dull story with clichéd jokes - what were the actors thinking?,5,22 October 2006,"an awful film.I love Nicholson (as good as it gets) but even he can't form an even acceptable partnership with Sandler in this predictable, clichéd, boring uninteresting black comedy.Sandler performs reasonably well alongside Nicholson as the anger patient but his character is always boring and doesn't grab audience interest. Nicholson's character appears dull and not his normal self.The characters are encoded into a story about therapy, love, bullying, work etc, the conventional stuff for this type of film, and never even for the slightest second grabs the audience's interest. Sandler goes to him for help and the story deteriorates from there.The ending is really awful. Everything comes too fast and makes you want to turn away, making you feel embarrassed to be watching it. I don't recommend it unless you want advice on who not to go to for therapy. Its a dull story throughout, poor acting, lame jokes making you want to be sick. Not worth watching.5/10",Anger Management

71,juliankennedy23,The movie will make you laugh. The ending will make you cry.,6,26 March 2005,"Anger Management: 6/10: Having a bad ending has torpedoed more than one film experience. The Village's twist was a groaner and the last scene of the Last Samurai knocked it down a rung or two. But in a comedy?Comedy is about laughter during the journey not the stories conclusion. None of our best comedies are known for their finales. Meet the Parents left with a comparative whimper, There's Something about Mary's ending is at best forgettable, and the bombastic over the top noise of say The Blues Brothers or Caddyshack certainly wasn't for everyone. (The exception to this rule is the wonderful Stay Puff marshmallow man payoff from Ghostbusters) Unlike thrillers or drama, comedy rarely invests enough in the plot to begin with for the ending to matter all that much. And an Adam Sandler comedy, lets face it, has less plot than most. (Or at the very least the same plot and characters over and over again. Sandler after all is the Jim Varney of Long Island nerds.) So to create a disaster this momentous you first need a good hour and change of comedy (rare enough esp. with Mr. Sandler on board) then you need an ending so stupendously bad it erases the laughter. Welcome to Anger Management. First the good news. This movie has some quite funny bits. The bad news well lets start with the last 15 minutes or so absolutely feel good romantic awfulness with enough celebrity cameos that could sink the Titanic, wipe out any goodwill one feels towards former Mayor Giulliani of New York and embarrass one to be a Yankee fan. Add on a plot device at the end that wouldn't be out of place in a Deanna Durbin film and let the jaw dropping awfulness commence.The last 15 minutes aside this movie has some really funny bits. Even stupid stuff like sweaters for overweight cats worked for me. Now that's rare. The set-up is pure gold and the cast is great. If anything Sandler is easily theweakest of the bunch. (Luis Guzman and John Turturro's characters needed their own movie and it was great seeing Jack be Jack again after that slog that was About Schmidt. Sandler knows how to do cruel. Anger Management was such a good concept and had such funny execution that it demanded a dark cruel outburst of energy at the end not this indescribably painful schmaltz.",Anger Management

73,Rogue-32,Method to the madness,7,17 April 2003,"Anger Management's set-up involves a shaky premise that severely tests one's ability to suspend disbelief if one is to stay put in one's seat and continue watching, and what happens from that point is so completely outrageous, ridiculous and insane that it boggles the mind. But this is a good thing, in this movie, see, because it's hilarious.Jack Nicholson (in full freakazoid mode, complete with his deranged twitching eyebrows and his beyond-perverse I-am-still-the-devil leering grin) and Adam Sandler (massively controlled, making the scenes where he actually explodes even funnier) are perfect together, and there is even a pay-off of sorts by the end, but by that time - although I still of course appreciated it - I didn't even really care; I was having much too much fun roaring in laughter throughout this shameless foray into demented chicanery.
There's a scene, for instance, with the great Harry Dean Stanton as a blind man in a bar, that had me nearly falling off my seat.  And by the time Sandler's childhood nemesis (a maniacal John C. Reilly) shows up as a monk in a monastery (for the Adam Sandler movie requisite senseless-over-the-top-violence scene), fuggedaboudit.Towards the beginning, I found myself wondering why Jack Nicholson decided to do this movie, in light of all the brilliantly serious performances he's been gracing us with recently, and I finally figured it out - this was his final and ultimate revenge for having to put up with Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Works for me.",Anger Management
74,TheNorthernMonkee,starts badly but gets better,3,29 July 2004,"SPOILERSAdam Sandler is normally quite good at making people laugh. In ""Mr Deeds"" (2002) he made arguably his finest film. That piece of cinema was a hilarious, feel good film. In contrast, ""Anger Management"" tries to do the same thing, but doesn't work. It starts badly and gets slightly better towards the end, but by then it's too late.In this latest outing, Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a guy who never stands up for himself and is constantly put upon. After an irritating incident on a plane, Buznik is farcically put into ""Anger Management"" and is taught by Dr Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) to overcome his inner anger.It's hard to know where to start with ""Anger Management"". It's beginning is infuriating with the plane journey and the subsequent forty minutes causing the audience to groan with disgust and actually get a little bored. The jokes are hideously unfunny, and Jack Nicholson should, to be totally honest, be ashamed of himself for appearing in this film. Nicholson is one of the worst parts of this film as the anger management doctor who places Buznik into awful and unpleasant situations. The cameo by Heather Graham is equally obnoxious, and by an hour in, most people will probably have turned their television off or left the cinema. The irony is that it's after this half way mark that the film improves slightly. The jokes seem funnier, although after the beginning that isn't hard, and we begin to feel for Sandler's Buznik character as his relationship with Marisa Tomei appears to collapse. Sadly by this time though, some will have given up on this bad film, and not one hundred comedic gags could rescue this piece of junk.To summarise then, Sandler normally produces some quite good films, but this feeble effort isn't one of those. With Jack Nicholson putting in an excruciating performance as Rydell, the film is due to suffer even more, and whilst the second half is a considerable improvement on the first, by that time we've given it up as a bad job. Sandler must try harder next time.",Anger Management

Sandler and Nicholson are both hilarious in their own right in the film, but they are brilliant together. Dave Buznik (Sandler) is a businessman who is mistaken to have anger issues and is recommended to Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson). Buddy puts Dave through a series of unorthodox techniques which is made all the more funny when you see how they react to both their environment and each other. Sandler is great in this movie, but Nicholson is definitely the best actor. Buddy is also my favorite character. He's kind of the calm demeanor to Dave's irritability. If you like either Sandler or Nicholson I'd say give this movie a try.",Anger Management

And then there's Dave's personal problems with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei).As for comedy Anger Managment flows pretty nicely and the jokes are mostly in their correct places and it has very few awkward moments, which seldom plague comedies of this particular genre.Can't actually think of anything extremely negative to say about it, I'm very pleasantly surprised by the flick, it gave me good laughs and it will probably last multiple viewings, thanks to Nicholson, who really keeps this movie above the gray mass of comedy sea.",Anger Management

78,bigverybadtom,Contrived And Hardly Funny,2,16 June 2013,"Having heard about this movie, I suggested seeing this movie with my then-girlfriend (fortunately on video at her condo) because I had heard about it, though she seemed reluctant to see it. After viewing it, I discovered the cause of her reluctance.A man who hates being affectionate with his girlfriend in public finds himself framed and sentenced by a judge to an anger management course. He then has an instructor who has him do all sorts of crazy things that are too much even for a screwball comedy. Of course the whole thing had been all set up by the girlfriend in order to cure him of his shyness.There were only two really funny parts of this movie. One was the part where the actress is wearing a Boston Red Sox top, and the man tells her that he really wanted her to take off the top so he wouldn't have to see the Red Sox name, rather than because he wants to see her bosom. (Knowing the rivalry between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees, this comment was actually quite credible.) The other was the end where the man gets back at his instructor by scaring him over the car that got wrecked in the parking lot. Overall, though, this was hardly a good movie.",Anger Management

80,lawprof,"Slight, Overlong, Some Laughs, Lenny's Hijacked Again",3,8 May 2003,"This is the second New York City-centered comedy this year to hijack Leonard Bernstein's ""West Side Story"" score.  The first was ""Analyze That,"" not exactly a memorable film but the music worked better there than here.  So did the film. I think Lenny would be aghast at the use of ""I Feel Pretty"" here.""Anger Management"" had more potential than it developed.  Jack Nicholson plays, more or less, himself on overdrive as he maniacally acts the part of a doctor who guides assorted neurotics with temper problems through a control course.  His patient load seems to come almost directly and exclusively through the courts.  In ""As Good As it Gets"" he played opposite the very talented Helen Hunt in a story that however bizarre shined as a real relationship between opposites developed.Here it's Nicholson and Adam Sandler, a poor actor who should begin the next phase of his career as a frequent guest on regional cable TV quiz shows. Sandler is falsely (or so it seems) charged and convicted for acting out on an airline in mid-flight.  No one behind this film seems to have realized that such behavior isn't the stuff of funny material these days.An idiot lawyer and a jerk of a judge sentence Sandler to the care of Nicholson.  The rest is predictable as Nicholson goes full throttle in Sandler's face, moving in with him and dogging his work and personal life. Sight gags and physical humor, much of it not amusing, fill up a lot of screen time.  Too much.Marissa Tomei, one of the best and least usefully employed actresses working today, is achingly appealing as Sandler's girlfriend.  This loser doesn't deserve the warm, sweet Tomei.  John Turturro deserves mention as an off and on violent patient of the good doctor - his portrayal of a guy so near to dropping off the edge that he must suffer from vertigo is delicious.I admit to personal pique at seeing yet another cameo appearance by our former mayor, Rudy Guiliani.  This time he has his soon-to-be bride, Judith Nathan, gawking with him at a Yankees game.  It's no surprise that in this film he ignores, indeed applauds,  criminal behavior (assaulting cops and ball park officials).  Many in the theater laughed at Sandler's taking over the ball game - fans popping out to the infield and decking players and officials probably aren't amusing to Major League baseball.  There's been enough of that.  The Yankee players recruited for the movie, including Derek Jeter, should be ashamed to have supported this lame effort at humor.The funny moments don't add up to a film worth seeing.3/10.",Anger Management
81,movieguy1021,Anger Management: 6/10,6,17 April 2003,"`I'm retarded,' Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) tells Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), after Buddy tells Dave to retard his anger. Actually, that can be used to describe the majority of the movie.Dave is a mild-mannered businessman who is on a plane from a business trip when he sits next to Buddy, who is cracking up at Tomcats. Dave wants a headset, also, so he keeps on asking a flight attendant, who mistakes what he's saying for an argument. For punishment, Judge Daniels (the late, great Lynne Thigpen) sentences him to thirty days of Buddy's anger management course. Guess what? Buddy is over the top and insists on following him around, making Dave's life a living hell.I wasn't really sure if I was looking forward to this movie, but I see that I was, since I did see it. Although it wasn't as funny as some of Sandler's other movies, especially Happy Gilmore, it had some good sporadic laughs here and there, most of them big. Although some times, it seemed really padded, especially with it being the second recent movie to have `I Feel Pretty' from West Side Story in it, the first being Analyze That.Anger Management had many cameos: Roger Clemens, Rudy Giuliani (who uses the famous `You can do it' line), Heather Graham, Luiz Guzman, Woody Harrelson, Kevin Nealon, John C. Reilly, and Harry Dean Stanton. Most of them I could recognize, except Woody Harrelson, since he was in drag (ewwrates as second worst movie going experience of 2003 so far: first is Kathy Bates in About Schmidt). The plot, well, there wasn't really much of one, but is there ever in a Sandler film?Sandler probably did his best acting to date (although I have not see Punch-Drunk Love yet), proving himself to be out of the slob comedy (which he hasn't done since Little Nicky). He may be able to go to real comedy. Nicholson seemed to be having tons of fun in his role of the aggressive doctor who needs the course in anger management. Marisa Tomei, as Sandler's heartthrob, is wasted, of course, as is John Turturro, someone else in the course. He was magnificent in Mr. Deeds, but he didn't have much of a role in this one.I've seen comparisons to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest from Anger Management, which doesn't really make sense. Sure, they both deal with mentality issues, but that's about it. One's an Oscar-winning drama, and the other is, well, Sandler's farewell to what made him famous.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 on appeal for crude sexual content and language.",Anger Management
82,policy134,Nicholson has done worse but this is a close second,2,12 August 2005,"What could have been a nice little comedy turns out to be a complete bore. Jack Nicholson could not be anymore subdued in his performance here and Sandler, who should have been replaced with an actor like Jim Carrey, does his usual repressed angry man routine that simply falls flat on it's face. Nicholson is supposed to be a weirdo and a man of respectability at the same time but we don't really feel that he is all that credible as an authority and his weirdness is just annoying instead of being funny. He tries to provoke Sandler in some kind of pseudo mental health treatment but how is it that Sandler follows his advice even though he knows pretty early on that he is dealing with a nutball.There are a few decent moments like the opening scene in the airplane with the snotty flight attendants who insist that Sandler is raising his voice, but nearly every comedy uses those jokes so that only generates laughs of recognition than great comedy.Another amusing scene is with the Buddhist monk who used to be Sandler's bully. Even though, the scene is highly unbelievable it is far better to have the bully be exactly the same as he used to be than having him totally transformed into a good guy. The casting of John C. Reilly was also right because he looks menacing enough and is still kind of soft spoken.Unfortunately, most scenes are just run of the mill psychiatrist jokes and the end could not be anymore contrived. Sandler has not made a movie yet that I could sit through saying ""That was brilliant!"" but his earlier like ""Billy Madison"" had ten times more laughs than this. Nicholson should do a Tim Burton or James L. Brooks film next because he has done way better with them than anybody else.",Anger Management

87,CinematicInceptions,"Standard issue Sandler comedy. Fair humor, but decent plot.",6,26 February 2015,"There isn't anything particularly special about this comedy. It has two big stars and was bound to make lots of money because of that, along with the amount of advertisement that wen't into it. The appealing title probably added a few viewers as well. It also, was bound to get a decent amount of hatred from critics for much the same reasons.Adam Sandler's character is a combination of two of his previous roles: Longfellow Deeds, and Happy Gilmore. David Buznik is an overly mild-mannered, like Deeds, and is put in situations that, as the title implies, make him angry. Sandler's rages closely resemble those from Happy Gilmore, and he doesn't have a personal language policy like with Mr. Deeds. Jack Nicholson's character is more than a little quirky and joins the ranks of unconventional teachers. He is very good at making Dave, as well as the audience, uncomfortable and horrified at several points.The comedy doesn't have an overriding amount of originality to it. There are a number of run-of-the-mill slapstick brawls. None of the verbal comedy is terribly witty or intelligent. Basically, the humor allows you to turn your brain off for a while. The PG-13 rating is well deserved, as there are a number of gay gags throughout accompanied by other themes that probably came up at your lunch table in high-school. Despite that, the jokes are well delivered and all of the characters are well acted.There is some cleaner situational comedy too, and most of this comes from the plot, which is the force that really drives this film. If you've watched the trailer or talked to anyone who had seen this movie, you likely have a good idea of the storyline. However, there are also lots of individual situations where the people around Dave overreact, which becomes a prominent theme of the movie. When I saw it for the first time, I was wondering if all of the overreaction was making some kind of statement against social norms of the time, since I was pretty young when the movie came out. I won't reveal the real cause of the overreactions since it would spoil the entire movie.If you get annoyed with the verbal comedy a few minutes into it, it's probably a waste of your time to finish watching. However, if you don't like the plot, I would definitely recommend that you watch the whole thing. It's a movie should be viewed more than once, in much the same way that The Prestige is. It's a pretty typical Adam Sandler movie, so I would recommend it to Sandler fans. You can watch it with a bunch of other people without worrying about missing the plot. It's not something you probably want to spend money on, but it's worth a try if you can watch it for free. Overall Rating: 8/10",Anger Management

His performance in ""Reign Over Me"" is brilliant work of art. He is a great actor. People cannot just blame movie's poor quality all on Adam Sandler.In buddy movie, chemistry between two actors decides movie's success, and Sandler and Nicholson's deserves compliments. I also like how the story develops in full length. It follows the foundation of the five steps of plot development so audience can enjoy without too many interruptions or reader's block.Ending in the baseball stadium was way too cheesy. What's up with this protagonist running into the stadium in rom com in early 2000s? I guess this scene is necessary to signify Sandler overcoming his passive aggressiveness, interior anger, and expressing his feelings in front of the crowd, but people chanting ""kiss her"" severely challenges my patience.

However, his counsellor, Dr. Buddy Rydell, has some rather unorthodox methods of treatment and, before long, Dave is in more trouble than ever.
Like a visit to the dentist or an overdue tax demand, the arrival of a new Adam Sandler film is something that strikes fear into the hearts of many - especially the discerning cinemagoer who finds his brand of humour too broad to swallow.With a track record that includes Mr. Deeds, Little Nicky and Eight Crazy Nights, it's easy to see why there are plenty who feel this way. But while Sandler has more than a few turkeys under his belt, it's unfair to assume he's incapable of making a good film. After all, The Wedding Singer was an enjoyable hit, and his creepy turn in Punch-Drunk Love showed that he's capable of ditching his trademark goofiness.Such is the case with Anger Management, which, while not without its flaws, is far more watchable and entertaining than the films that gained Sandler his reputation in the first place. At the very least, the fact that it shot past the $100 million mark in the US after three weeks on release, dragging American cinemas out of their wartime doldrums, suggests he must be doing something right.That said, the film's success doesn't so much hinge on Sandler's pratfalls as on his screen relationship with Jack Nicholson - and it's here that Anger Management hits its stride. From the genuinely hysterical airborne opening sequence - in which Sandler's simple request for a pair of headphones taps brilliantly into the paranoia of travelling in such security-conscious times - to the many other set-pieces in which the two share the screen, this is an inspired partnership that works far better than anyone ever had a right to expect.It's hard to imagine anyone other than Nicholson playing the unorthodox doctor. Rydell is a grotesque creation whose methods to cure his patient of his so-called ""mood swings"" include moving into his apartment, making inevitable moves on his girlfriend (Tomei) and, in one instance, encouraging Dave to sing songs from West Side Story in the middle of a crowded New York highway.Sandler, for once upstaged by somebody more over-the-top than himself, is in more restrained form than usual (although it would be hard to be anything but, given he has Nicholson's frantic mugging to contend with). As such, he makes for a splendid foil, looking slightly bemused throughout but bagging enough one-liners to hold his own against his co-star. This is the kind of buddy picture where everybody - not least the two stars - seems to be enjoying themselves, something that is obvious from the first moment that Sandler and Nicholson are together on screen. It's unfortunate, then, that the pair's relationship is at the expense of everybody and everything else, with a superb supporting cast - that includes Luis Guzman, Woody Harrelson and John Turturro as Sandler's ""anger buddy"" - given far too little to do.Tomei, as the romantic interest, is also underused. And while screenwriter Dorfman wrings enough laughs out of the script, he never realises the full potential of his dark premise, opting instead for a storyline that never quite answers the question of whether Sandler really has anger management issues or not.The ending feels lame, presumably in an effort to give audiences their feel-good fix but, as crowd-pleasers go, this delivers the goods and it won't do Sandler's reputation any harm. Besides, any film that features John C. Reilly as a sadistic Buddhist monk is likely to bring a smile to the face of even the aforementioned ""discerning cinemagoer"".",Anger Management
93,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,11 May 2021,"Cheerio from my local.There was a time when the airline scene leading up to Sandler's (as Dave) comedy of overblown predicaments would be seen as too far-fetched. I mean, how could an innocent airline encounter involve such over-reacting by a flight attendant...who would have thought that the months after 9/11, air travel was calmer than it is now? The humor, while still funny, is a bit frightening in its proximity to reality. We've seen report after report of innocent air passengers and their families being harassed by irrational airline employees - mostly flight attendants newly bestowed with an unreasonable amount of authority - but also pilots and security. Kicking a family off a plane because a baby won't wear a mask is more nuts than asking for in-flight headphones.As I re-watched this movie, I felt bad for Dave. I wasn't laughing at the lunacy of it...a situation that was once preposterous is now absolutely possible.Thankfully - what follows is a typically excellent Adam Sandler comedy flick. He and Jack Nicholson are great! It's all very predictable, but enjoyable overall.I like Sandler - not all of his stuff - Little Nicky, Zohan, and a few others aren't my thing - but, overall, the guy makes movies that entertain me...plus, it doesn't hurt that we share a similar outlook on our Country.Cheers.",Anger Management
94,rollernerd,I Feel Pretty...Goosfraba,7,11 November 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! *queue in intro music*Tonight's movie review is the comedy Anger Management (2003) where the Sandman plays cool and timid executive assistant Dave Buznik who has implosive issues and is unable to kiss his girlfriend in public and just can't stand up for himself due to getting teased when he was a kid. After an incident on an airplane, Dave is sent to anger management therapy run by specialist Dr. Buddy Rydell, played by the great legend Jack Nicholson. As the program progresses, the relationship between Dave and Buddy becomes more tense due to unorthodox methods by Buddy, which disrupts Dave's life. This movie is awesome. Nicholson steals the show as he plays an unpredictable, psychopathic character. Nicholson's performance really carries the movie to me with his perfect cues and great comedic laughs. The Sandman and Nicholson may sound like an unlikely duo but boy do they have great chemistry together. The ground rules laid by Buddy to Dave around not having rage enhancing substances including caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, crack-cocaine, sloppy flippers, jelly stingers, bing bangs or flying willards...whoever made this up in the script Nicholson delivers. The sharing the bed together and the over easy eggs debacle were great scenes. The one that really pulled it for me was the ""I Feel Pretty"" scene...had to rewatch that scene multiple times. The supporting cast members were great including John Turturro who plays Dave's anger ally Chuck, Luiz Guzman who plays the dude ""I told you not to go there!!"" and Woody Harrelson plays Galaxia from that Bavarian small village. Also Heather Graham with that Red Sox underwear wowww and the pick up line Buddy advises to give to Dave was hilarious. Overall, a silly classic Adam Sandler flick which can be re-watched many times - definitely one of my favourite Sandman movies 7.8/10",Anger Management

When Buddy had to take charge of calming down Dave's temper, it was met with silly and hilarious results along the way. Buddy's methods may deemed a little...weird and radical, but it somehow seen a change in Dave.There may be some kind of inside jokes of something along the way in the movie, but then I just kept quiet and tried to understand along.For people like me who can kind of flare her temper at times, I found myself giggling at times when watching.A comedy with some crude language being thrown in, but if one gets the drift, one will understand.",Anger Management

Partly because of the added spice of having Jack Nicholson team up with Adam Sandler in the same movie. Nicholson basically walks through his role as Buddy Rydall, a doctor who seems borderline insane and out to provoke Sandler's character as much as he can! Saying Jack Nicholson has done better films is obvious to say the least- for this Sandler vehicle is nowhere his best work.It takes awhile for 'Anger Management' to actually become funny, and some of the humour is awkward- like ""I feel pretty"" song, but even that made me chuckle. Jack is over the top but effective, and Sandler hits and misses with his usual gimmick. The supporting cast in John C. Reilly's angry monk and Woody Harrelson's Galaxia drew the biggest laughs for me, where John Turturro and Luis Guzman didn't do much for me in their roles. Marisa Tomei does okay in a token role, and overall, this film is cheesy and likable! This is not the best Adam Sandler movie, and it's basically in the same league as 'The Waterboy'!

99,Pookyiscute,Frustratingly bad,3,3 February 2006,"At the beginning of the film, we're led to believe it will be a light comedy with a few funny lines here and there. And, generally we expect an all around good movie, because after all, we are talking about Adam Sandler, who is one of the many kings of comedy, and Jack Nicholson, who correct me if I'm wrong, doesn't generally pick bad scripts, and is well known for his great choices in film.However, this film lies somewhere between bad and OK. From the first ten minutes in, until the end, I was waiting for it to get better, but sadly it just continued to disappoint me and get worse. The problem here, is not the acting, or even the writing, it's the audience that they are aiming it at. We are no longer given clever, actually funny written movies, we're given movies that idiots enjoy. Movies, that really don't peek our intellect, but rather, ""He got hit! ha ha!"" kind of humor. Some of the movie was entertaining, and I must have been really desperate, because I actually finished the film (which I have a hard time calling, since it's by my standards no ""film"").Morrisa Tomei played the part of Adam Sandler's girlfriend. She was very good as usual and as happy as I am to see her still on the silver screen, it disappoints me to think she's sunk to this level of acting. She must really need the money. Adam Sandler? What can I say? I was of course disappointed that he chose this role. I prefer ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""The Wedding Singer"" any day over this. But, I will give credit where credit is due. He was very convincing and very good in his role, although not a big goal to achieve.Jack Nicholson, surprisingly played, Jack Nicholson, as he never does, and was very convincing as himself. I thought that there were a few humorous and cute moments, but all in all, it was a very bad film, and if you're a ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"" fan, you don't want to check this film out.

This is a good film. It's good because of the casting mainly. Nicholson is the greatest non-comedian comedian in the world; if you know what I mean; his exuberant energy and insanity shine in every of his films. Sandler as always (playing the same character) is perfect for the roles he is assigned to. Furthermore, with the exception of the two leading roles, my favourite character had to be Chuck, played by John Torturro with such edge and explosiveness that it is a superb addition to the film.Sure it is sometimes episodic, disjointed and implausible, but it is also funny, irreverent and entertaining...6/10",Anger Management

Adam Sandler in the 2000's has kinda lost his niche. He's not the funny man he used to be.Anger Management is more a showcase of how nuts Jack Nicholson is and how hot Marisa Tomei can be shown. It's a movie with a bunch of big names and the rest is a bunch of people that have turned up in all of Sandler's films before.It's got nearly zero comedy and begins with an interesting start. It's weird how it makes you think this could be something more than it turns out to me. It's nothing but a let down that makes you question the writer on his sense of humor.It's not funny anymore to watch Adam freak out. It's not funny to have Adam start singing randomly or pretend he got zapped. I found myself questioning why Adam decided to do this film. Back in 2003, I assume I had a much better time with the film being only 14, but at 21 I don't find the same stuff as funny.It's really a waste of an hour and a half to watch this mediocre film. It had a potential to be a really funny film and with a slice of romance but Tomei is hardly used for story and the rest of the film is laced with small-time actors such as Allan Covert.I'd suggest any Adam Sandler fan to stay clear of Anger Management and perhaps venture back to a classic like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison for some real laughs.",Anger Management

For the most part it was a lot cheap jokes about penis size and a lot of events that seemed non realistic.The plot I thought was OK, but it was poorly executed. The idea of having to go to Anger Management is a good idea but the doctor Sandler goes to see, played by Jack Nicholson, just was lame to me. This is one of Nicholson's worst jobs in my opinion, he is neither funny or interesting and whenever he was on screen he just looked like he was trying to hard at something that should not have been attempted. The acting was the biggest issue for me, John Torturo and Woody Harrelson both turned in awful performances. Torturo at times makes jokes that are God Awful and whoever thought It was a good idea to have Harrelson dress up like a woman should be fired from giving any future ideas for movies. Sandler does a decent job but i think he has done something like this before so he really adds nothing new.SO this is not a very good film in my opinion. I really do not recommend it to anyone.",Anger Management
104,MovieGuy109,I had to manage my anger at the writers,5,15 November 2011,"Anger Management-*-Worthless- Directed by: Peter Segal, Written by: David Dorfman, Starring: Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei, John Turturro, Luis Guzman, Allen Covert, Lynne Thigpen, Kurt Fuller, Woody Harrelson, Krista Allen, January Jones, Kevin Nealon, Harry Dean Stanton.Another brainless, offensive, and crude Sandler comedy stars him as a struggling man living in New York City who through a series of silly events becomes the main subject of a wacked out therapist (Nicholson), leading him into plenty of crude situations.It is so mindless in its delivery because writer Dorfman does not care who he offends and he sets out to offend a lot of different groups of people. His screenplay becomes perfect fodder for the crude Sandler and director Segal. The film offends the Buddhist philosophy, anybody with anger, and has a very unfunny vignette about a transsexual played by Harrelson in his biggest comedown after pulling off the role of Larry Flynt in a Milos Forman film.Sandler is horrible in the lead role as normal and his goofy persona shows more than ever here, while Nicholson offers an occasional giggle, but little else, and Tomei seems bored by the whole thing.

But then we have Anger Management, which you may have expectations for since it has Jack in it. And the movie far passed my expectations... The film is simplistic, a bit cheesy sometimes, but overall it includes some good humor to tag along. The only complaint is the cheesiness or possibly the lame attempts at creating some kind of 'emotional touch' every movie needs nowadays. It comes off pretty lame and a bit cringe-worthy. Nevertheless, if you take away the flaws; the film plays out to be a pretty average comedy that includes some great humor. So that is about it, actually. If you have some sort of love for comedies, I would love to recommend Anger Management. As far as we know, comedies nowadays (and back then) include some cheesy and lame attempts at things. So if your used to those, then this film should par with a good comedy. If your picky about the little things that take away from the film, I shouldn't be so happy to recommend this.

109,ilovedolby,Sandler seriously needs to change his image.,6,11 April 2003,"Adam Sandler seriously needs to change his image. He does the same roles over and over; the same guy who lives in New York, in the same apartment, and there is always someone picking on him. I thought after he did `Punch Drunk Love,' he was starting to drift away from the conventional characters he consistently plays in films like `Big Daddy,' and `Mr. Deeds.' Quite the contrary, even his animated film, `Eight Crazy Nights' showed the same basic Sandler that we've come to know. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a trailer for `Anger Management.' I thought that teaming him up with Jack Nicholson would be great. Perhaps, Jack could even teach the young actor a few pointers about how to get out of the rut of the same characterization he's in-but I was wrong. `Anger Management' proves to bet yet another clichéd Sandler flick, with a big-time star accompanying him around throughout the film, creating mayhem wherever the two go. 	`Anger Management' is the story of Dave Buznik (Sandler) who while on a plane, is accused of raising his voice and creating a disturbance. After a court hearing, the judge assigns him to anger management therapy and thus begins the pandemonium of the film. His anger management coach is none other than Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson), a famed therapist who has written a book on harnessing anger. After one accidental catastrophe after another, Buznik keeps getting himself into more trouble with the law. Thus, Rydell decides to move in with Buznik to observe his behavior and try to heal Buznik's Toxic Anger Syndrome' or T.A.S. Through a series of hair-brained attempts to cure Buznik, Rydell teaches him the importance of his relationship with his beautiful girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei), and to channel his anger in a more appropriate manor. 	There are so many little things in this film that are just rehashed jokes, or attempts on the part of the screenwriter to make the audience laugh, and in the end, it works-I guess it doesn't take much to amuse some people. The audience seemed to love the film at the showing I attended. But here's one major problem; Sandler needs to stop using the same cronies in every other film he does. Allen Covert follows Sandler around as if his career depended on it. The sad fact of the matter is that it does. Covert has appeared in several Sandler flicks including `Little Nicky,' `Big Daddy,' and `The Wedding Singer.' Without Sandler, Covert is a nobody. 	A second problem exists; since `Analyze That,' the sequel to the Billy Crystal/Robert DeNiro flick, `Analyze This,' did so poorly at the box-office, the makers of `Anger Management' figured that they could cash-in on some of the same jokes and concepts. For one, DeNiro did a rendition of a song from the play, `West Side Story' in `Analyze That.' Sandler and Nicholson do the same one here as a temper controller, gleefully singing, `I feel pretty, oh so pretty. I feel pretty, and witty, and bright' while holding up traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. While the audience found this to be amusing, I couldn't help but feel cheated. The whole thing was so trivial. 	One last complaint, stop saying that stupid `you can do it.' It does grow rather annoying considering they also appear in every pathetic Rob Schneider flick. 	Having said that, I did think that there were some humorous parts to the film. For example, how anyone cannot laugh at Woody Harrelson dressed in drag and acting like a German she-male is beyond me. And naturally, Nicholson is fun to watch with his psychotic expressions and actions. 	`Anger Management' was directed by Peter Segal who has done such comedies as `Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,' and `Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult;' the latter film being probably his best work.	The bottom line is `Anger Management' is slightly above a mediocre movie that could have been far better. **1/2",Anger Management

It's a cliché, paint by numbers movie where nothing seems overly fresh nor original. Good premise, Jack Nicholson playing an anger management adviser does have it's own inside joke with it if anyone remembers his work with a 9 iron and someone's windshield. And as a native Philadelphian, I thought the joke about a Philadelphia sports fan needing to go to an anger class was funny, but that's about it. A few mild chuckles, but by the end when we find out what the entire movie was really about, I was the one who was angry. I won't give away the ending, but all is not what it seems, and that was just too much for this viewer. Adam Sandler plays, well, Adam Sandler in this movie. Rather one dimensional, with a girlfriend who doesn't think he'll ever commit, and that get's the ball rolling. The story's not important to us, because it wasn't important to the movie maker.

111,MF210,So far The Worst Movie To Come Out This Year,7,11 September 2003,"My Rating: * out of ****. I saw Anger Management for the purpose that there was not much else out. Lets just say, I hated it. I think Adam Sandler has an uneven resume, there are movies I like of his and there are some I just dont care for. I have never actually hated one of his movies (although I never saw Little Nicky, nor do I want to), but Anger Management actually begins a new category. Adam Sandler movies that are plain terrible. Anger Management offers an interesting premise. But with all the bad and unfunny jokes its just a mess of a movie. There may have been possibly one time when I laughed, but thats it. Theres a twist at the end that I would have thought was more clever, if the movie had been somewhat watchable.
The acting is not much of a strength. I thought Adam Sandler was great in 2002's Punch Drunk Love, but I found him unconvincing and dull here. Jack Nicholson makes his character into a caricature. This performance does call for Nicholson to be over the top, but hes just ridiculous and kind of annoying. I wanted his scenes to be cut or maybe someone else to play the character. Marisa Tomei is somewhat pleasant to save a few scenes of the movie, but she is not in it much. Anger Management could have been good, and thats probably the biggest disappointment. It needed a more intelligent script, and as much as I'm a fan of Jack Nicholson, I dont think he should have been in this movie. Anger Management is a waste of a movie.",Anger Management
112,richspenc,Had some problems alright,2,22 January 2016,"Anger management was indeed pretty stupid in many ways. The acting was sophomoric and dumb. Dave Buzneck(Adam Sandler) was actually more mellow in this film than in a number of his other films such as ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Drunk punch love"". And that irony, since the name of this movie is Anger Management, is supposed to be a joke on its own. That's the first of many jokes here that failed. The next problem was with many of the other characters. Most of them acted pretty stupid. Lines such as ""I lost my ice cream truck job today! No more fudgsicles!"" and ""Don't leave me Mom, you're all I've got! No more clam chowder""!"" were annoyingly stupid. And Jack Nicholson's crying during that second quote I just listed was so weird and fake, and he was supposed to have been crying for real then. The next problem, the gimmick of how Sandler was actually acting quite calm but other people, such as the flight attendant and air marshal could only see him being angry. The next problem, Nicholson himself acting more lowbrow than ever. Just compare him here to his characters in ""The shining"" or ""As good as it gets"". The next problem, the overuse of cameos doing almost embarrassing roles. Such as Woody Harrelson in drag or NY mayor Rudy Giolanni saying an embarrassing line at Yankees Stadium. Then, the horribly cliché scene at Yankees Stadium. And we see quick cutaways to other movie characters in the bars, in their living rooms, all watching their TVs of Yankees Stadium being televised and they're all chanting along (""lets go David, lets go!"") with the fans chanting the same thing at Yankee Stadium. It's so stupid. That never happens in real life. They used the same stupid idea at the end of the movie "" Elf"", where they cut away quickly to different places such as bars, homes, etc. where the people in those places are all watching their TVs and singing along with the televized characters singing in Central Park. It's all so fake and annoying. And so was this movie.The only good thing was how hot January Jones and her porn girlfriend were in both the sexy skimpy outfits they were revealed to be wearing at the restaurant, and the girl on girl kissing and fondling during the anger management session. I just did not understand why they would be viewed as someones with anger problems. Angry is not the word I saw them as, and their toe biting off and lips being stapled shut story was unconvincing and ridiculous, and did not match up with the way they were in this movie. The writers just needed some excuse to fit those hotties into the movie, and personally, I think that it was something in this movie that they did right.One more quick question; what the heck are slippy flippy, jelly stingers, trick sticks, and flying Willard's? I've been looking up websites on them and can't find any sites that say what they are. All I can find is movie quotes with the slippy flippy, etc. lines. What are they? Are they a kind of candy or snack treat you can only find in New York? Since that's where the movie is taken. Or are they just fictional products for this movie? If it's that, the movie should've explained what they are or else it's just something that completely went over our heads.",Anger Management
113,Torgo_Approves,Goosefraba,7,18 August 2006,"(r#53)Anger Management is more than just another clone of ""Happy Gilmore"", and it avoids being the stereotypical, mindless Sandler comedy because of some interesting ideas and themes, an unpredictable twist, and a superb cast (including the hilarious cameos). David Buznik (Sandler himself) is a man of implosive anger. Ever since having his privates laughed at by the love of his life as a child, he's been subconsciously as well as consciously suppressing his anger while everyone from his boss to his girlfriend Linda's (a cute Marisa Tomei) best friend, the well-equipped Andrew (Allen Covert) push him around. One day Dave is arrested for assaulting a stewardess on a flight and assigned to Anger Management, a self-help group lead by the completely insane Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson at his finest, you can tell he's really enjoying himself). Buddy's healing methods appear a bit unorthodox, to say the least, but will they help David let go of his anger? I can't say I'm much of a fan of Adam Sandler in movies like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. In movies of that type he doesn't have a lot of funny material to work with, and his overacting is more embarrassing than funny (I know I'm in the minority here). In ""Anger"" he's perfectly suited for his role. Every staggering, wooden sentence he utters perfectly describes what kind of character he is and it is impossible not to feel for him at times. We've all been frustrated in more than one situation in which we can't say what we really feel, and Sandler perfectly translates this to the screen; intentionally or not, it works.Of course it is the legendary Jack himself who dominates the screen, and who is the main reason to see this movie. While other screen giants of the seventies and eighties seem to slip into obscurity over time (Robert De Niro hasn't been in anything really good since Jackie Brown, for example, and when Christopher Walken and Pacino have been reduced to cameos in Gigli, something is seriously wrong), Nicholson continues to star in unforgettable movies even as he gets older. The highly enjoyable and meaningful About Schmidt comes to mind, and I'm extremely happy to see he's going to work with Martin Scorcese in the upcoming The Departed, which comes out this very year. Jack is simply doing what he does best in ""Anger Management"" and his intensity is what really carries the film. He gets some of the best lines of his career, specifically the ""implosive-explosive"" speech and the classic ""I feel pretty"" sequence. As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the highlights of Nicholson's, and *especially* Sandler's, career and although far from being as good as The Shining or Punch-Drunk Love, ""Management"" is great fun with enough intelligence and wit to satisfy most viewers, as well as a bit of the usual lowbrow Sandler comedy. The corny ending at the stadium aside, the film is fun from start to finish, if you can stand watching David Buznik go through all kinds of social torture at the hands of Dr. Rydell. A great supporting cast (John Turturro, Luis Guzmán, Kurt Fuller) and a myriad of cameos, including John McEnroe, Heather Graham, Woody Harrelson, Rudy Guiliani and Harry Dean Stanton are just icing on the cake. I don't understand why so many people disliked this movie - how can you not laugh at a Woody Harrelson, in drag, referring to Nicholson as ""Mr. Eyebrows""?",Anger Management
114,Bravesfan17,Adam Sandler + Jack Nicholson = Comedy Gold,8,21 May 2010,"Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson acting together in a movie is pure comedy gold, and that is the case with Anger Management. Adam Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a designer for cat clothing who has anger issues. When asked to go on a business trip for his boss, he goes. When on the plane, a guy takes his seat, the flight attendant purposely acts offended, and a stranger offers the seat next to his. That stranger is Dr. Buddy Rydell, played by Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is hilarious in his part and shows that he is still one of the best actors out there.After the flight goes wrong, Dave is forced to go through anger management. However, Dave doesn't know what he is in for when he goes to his first session, taught by Dr. Rydell. Some of Sandler's buddies appear as anger management classmates, including John Turturro, Luis Guzman, and Jonathan Loughran.Along with those is a love interest for Adam Sandler's character. That is Linda, played wonderfully by Marisa Tomei. Tomei shows us that Linda can't stand what is happening to Dave, yet she cares about him enough to help him better himself.However, Buddy has tactics that are known to be unusual, yet they work. Dave can't stand it, and wants out, but Buddy won't let him. Buddy proves that he can show Dave how to stop his anger in many situations. Including a very funny one where Dave meets a cross-dresser, played hilariously in a cameo by Woody Harrelson.The story is funny and interesting and the laughs keep coming. This is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies and fits in the realm of many of his other movies.",Anger Management
115,saarvardi,Sandler's popular tend to breakdown is boosted with the help of one Jack Nicholson,9,9 April 2007,"During the past few years, director Peter Segal showed the world he can work wonders with the popular comedian Adam Sandler. Sandler, usually a rather one dimensional actor that enjoys playing himself on screen (a thing he does quite well, if I might say so myself), blossomed in numerous sub-genres under the hands of Segal, showing he can be romantic as hell (50 First Dates), charismatic (The Longest Yard) and most important – irresistibly cranky (Anger Management).In this comedy powerhouse, Sandler's popular tend to breakdown is boosted with the help of one Jack Nicholson, movie legend and an astonishingly funny actor on his own right. Nicholson's collaboration with Sandler proves he really should be doing more comedies, as their encounter creates many hilarious moments. The plot, in short, revolves around Dave Buznik (Sandler), your average Joe that has a very short temperament that costs him his freedom. After breaking down on a plane, he's teamed up with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson), an anger management guru with some psychotic issues of his own. Rydell follows Buznik's every move, making his condition only worse and driving him to the edge. This results in some hysterically funny encounters with the law and with unsuspected civilians caught up in the mix. It also reaches a climax in one of my favorite comedic moments of recent years, when Rydell forces Buznik to sing The Westside Story's ""I Feel Pretty"" while blocking the traffic on a crowded bridge.On a more personal note, I would like to add that I've seen Anger Management several days after an acquaintance of mine, himself a comedian, was killed in a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, Israel. It was comforting to snap back to reality with an uplifting feature that puts many things in life in just the right proportions.",Anger Management

When a plane incident sentences Buznik to anger management therapy, his therapist, Dr. Rydell, proves to be more than...eclectic in his approach. The film takes us through Dave's anger rehabilitation with some very funny and crazy scenes. Jack fuses his bizarre old-school style with Adam's zany personality, making for a few good fits of insanity. Don't ruin the surprise ending by reading any review spoilers. 7/10",Anger Management

But o.k. I would get over that, if the jokes were laughable, but sadly no. Maybe its my sense of humor, but after U.S. ""Dumb and dumber"" or European ""Full monty"", the scriptwritters just don't put that much effort for more demanding viewers and create original jokes. Well, despite that, the movie is still provides some entertainment, thanks to (although one of his weakest performance) Jack Nicholson and very cute Heather Graham.5 out of 10",Anger Management
118,chvylvr80,Sandler's act is wearing a little thin,4,14 April 2003,I was expecting this movie to be really funny. I was disappointed to see that Adam Sandler is basically playing the same character that he has been in every movie. That gets old real fast. Some people can do it but that's for people with more talent than Sandler. Jack is great. He always is and you don't need me to tell you that. I just came away from this movie thinking it should have been funnier. John Turturro is the one high point of the film in that he and Jack deliver the only good acting and his performance is totally off the wall. I don't know why Marisa Tomei is considered a good actress when it seems that she basically phoned her part in. Bottom Line: This movie is not Sandler's best but if you like his movies then you will probably like this one.,Anger Management

Although a bit long, the script has enough twists to keep the pot on a steady simmer.",Anger Management
120,FeverDog,"Extra, extra - read all about it...",3,12 January 2004,"In June 2002 I received an email inviting me to be an extra for three nights in the Yankee Stadium crowd scenes. Although the gig did not pay anything, I imagined maybe I'll meet Adam Sandler and/or Jack Nicholson, be taken under their wing, become a Flavor of the Month, and spiral down in a blaze of drugs and alcohol, lamenting the demise of my short-lived Hollywood career, wondering in a haze of booze and pharmaceuticals where it all went.  Or something.Well, I had planned to go all three nights, but I wound up going only the first, which was a Monday. (I had free tickets to a Brooklyn Cyclones game on Tuesday, and it was just too muggy that Wednesday to go to the Bronx and sit around doing next to nothing for five hours.)Anyway, being a movie extra in a crowd scene is pretty tedious but not the worst way to spend an evening without having to pay for anything. Signing in and being corralled in a semi-organized way took over an hour. We were instructed where to sit and how to ""act"" without upstaging the scene or drawing unwanted attention to oneself.The first bit shot was (I think) of Roger Clemens rooting for Adam Sandler. (I was seated five rows behind the Yankees dugout, and who knew those seats had cushions and cupholders? I guess that's the justification for their ticket price.) After that was completed it took about forty minutes to reset the cameras to film Marisa Tomei's part in the stands. The third scene was a Steadycam shot of Jack Nicholson and Marisa walking to their seats. Total film for five hours work? Maybe ten minutes.So I was this close to Roger, Adam, Jack and Marisa at different times throughout the night. (I was seated above where Jack and Marisa were entering the stadium and could very easily have ""accidentally"" spilled water on them.) Roger didn't stay long (I guess he had to get back with his team, which was on the road in Baltimore), but Adam seemed to love hanging out with his fans. Marisa didn't display any diva-like behavior; she chatted with the crew during much of the downtime. Jack was Jack, naturally - sporting shades whenever he wasn't being filmed, and mostly ignoring the crowd.I was disappointed that there was no actual baseball action going on; that night's scenes were taking place just before the start of the game (when Adam takes the mic). But it's probably a good thing the extras in uniform didn't have to fake athletic ability; some of them were warming up in the background, and it appeared that many of them had never picked up a mitt before. One of them, a Red Sox extra, threw like a girl and caught like one too, and was naturally razzed by the crowd near him. (I guess he realized that wearing a Red Sox uniform in the Bronx ain't gonna make you any friends, but he took the good-natured ""Boston sucks"" ribbing in stride.)So, I had a good time. We were supplied given a snack pack, a break for dinner (I had a veggie wrap), and enough bottled water to fill the Assistant Director's fat ass and monumental ego. (The less said about him, the better.) There were lookalike contests between takes (some guy was a ringer for Fat Bastard) as well as ample time to get to know your neighbor.  I'm glad I went for one night, at least.I didn't see the finished movie until recently (I was vacationing in the U.K. when it opened in theatres).  After my oh-so-hard work on the project, I was disappointed that I was unable to see myself anywhere.  The one shot where I was sure to be spotted (the Steadycam following Jack and Marisa from the concourse to their seats, with ADR inserted later) cut before they turned toward my section.  Oh well, I already had my fifteen minutes. (I was on an episode of ""Ricki Lake"" once; comments about that are pending.)As for ANGER MANAGEMENT itself, it's typical Sandler crap, filled with jokes that aren't funny, ending with the generic, warm-and-fuzzy third act we've all seen countless times before in both better and worse movies.  So, PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE remains Sandler's best film, and the only one I like. (Well, AIRHEADS wasn't awful, but who considers that an Adam Sandler movie?)",Anger Management

122,DanB-4,Not Funny Enough,6,5 December 2003,"Anger Management is not a terrible movie, but it is not a particularly good one either. It has its funny scenes, but they are over taken by the painfully bad ones, such as Adam Sandler singing ""I Feel Pretty"" and Rudi Guiliani's embarrassing cameo.There is really no need to describe the plot. This is the typical example, for me anyway, of a filmed idea. Take Sandler, who generally plays an uptight psychopath, make him mild mannered, add Jack Nicholson for credibility, 2 dozen awkward cameos, lesbian references and Heather Graham in a bra and everything should work out.Unfortunately, for Anger Management, it repeats its own formula too many times and laughs are too spread out my inane circumstances and unfunny scenes.For Sandler fans, there are enough fart jokes to make you happy. For Jack fans, you may witness his worst ever movie, even though he makes the best of what little the script gives him. The ending is so contrived it hurts, and most of the cameos seem like they were written after the star was booked. John McEnroe's works, primarily because he does not speak.Worth a rental if you are a Sandler fan. ** out of ****.",Anger Management

124,dirtychild,Has it's moments,6,18 February 2005,"Anger Management stars Adam Sandler who is a pet company exec who is sentenced to an anger-management program after a ""air-rage"" incident. He befriends Dr Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) who ends up moving in with Sandler for a much more hands-on anger-management program.This movie has its moments. Sandler plays his slow-burning quiet type character well here (shades of ""Punch Drunk Love"" here) which is a good contrast to Jack Nicholson's womanising anger-management guru.The opening air-rage incident is quite funny (definitely playing on the State's fear of flying post-911). And some of the characters are funny including a sexually (and anger) charged lesbian porno couple who are also anger-management recruits.But when the movie goes into the whole side-plot of Sandler's love interest falling out with him - the movie takes a bit of a dive. And all of the cameos in this film get a bit distracting (the whole Rudy Giuliani cameo is just stupid!).Overall - this movie is worth a look if you like Sandler - not his best work but not his worst!",Anger Management
125,Captain Ed,What were they thinking?? **SPOILERS**,2,20 May 2003,"""Anger Management"" is easily the worst film I have ever paid to see, and possibly the worst film I've seen since ""Battlefield Earth"".  My companions and I sat in the theater like baby seals just after the hammer has fallen, slack-jawed, completely amazed that this made it onto the screen.  Even the drunk couple behind us, who guffawed and parroted the dialogue for the first half hour, sat in complete (blessed) silence for the last 90 minutes.To recap the plot, Sandler's character -- a schlemiel who can't assert himself -- gets into an altercation with an overly sensitive flight attendant and gets sentenced to 20 hours of anger management classes. Nicholson plays the therapist, who insists on moving in with Sandler and turns his life upside down.  After a long series of incidents that bear little resemblance to real life or any sort of human emotion or interaction, the therapist winds up with Sandler's girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) and is about to steal Sandler's idea about proposing at a Yankees game.  Will Sandler finally assert himself with his boss, Tomei's friend who's been putting the moves on her, and his psycho therapist?Well, if you can't figure that out, then by all means go see the movie.With the notable exception of Adam Sandler, the cast does a pretty good job with what they're given.  The only laughs came from Jack Nicholson, but even those were few and mostly up front.  Marisa Tomei is completely wasted in this role; was she bored, or did they pay her a truckload of money to do this?  There are a number of excellent character actors supporting this trio: Luiz Guzman, John Turturro, Kurt Fuller, and Allen Covert.  There are some good cameos by Rudy Giuliani, Roger Clemens, Derek Jeter, and a funny one from Bobby Knight, maybe the funniest part of the whole movie.However, both the script and Sandler are the pits.  Not only are the situations, and the results of those situations, completely implausible, but there is only so much humor to be mined from seeing a guy get shafted.  With this execrable effort, there is almost none.  Sandler sleepwalks through his scenes, through his lines, and through the entire movie with two facial expressions: screaming and bovine.  Even if Tom Hanks took over the role, David Dorfman's script is inept, and the dialogue makes your skin crawl. You don't root for Sandler, you don't root for Nicholson, and you don't root for Tomei either -- you do want to ask why she's bothering with this drooling idiot.** BIG TIME SPOILERS **Then at the end, the film sticks it to you one last time: the whole thing has been a set-up by Tomei to get Sandler to be more assertive.  Yes, Dr. Jack has been humiliating Sandler at every opportunity to get him to strike back.  The Deus ex Machina effect is completely numbing, almost to the point (but not quite) where you don't want to question why Dr. Jack felt it necessary to destroy someone else's luxury car, or to beat up a Buddhist, or to do most of what went on in the preceding 100 minutes.  All you want to do is vomit and leave the theater as soon as possible, in that order.Unfortunately, it's too rude for younger children, so this should only be seen by bad-cinema aficionados, or seriously deranged masochists.

127,MovieLuvaMatt,Set aside your snobbery and just laugh,8,20 June 2003,"This is by no means high-brow entertainment, but it sure is hilarious with a capital ""H""!!!  Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler make a wonderful team.  I wouldn't expect a great, Oscar-winning actor like Nicholson to want to do as much as breathe the same air as Sandler, but he seems to be having tons of fun and the two of them have great chemistry.  One of the funniest moments is their duet of ""I Feel Pretty.""Nicholson sports his eyebrow-slanting evil grin more than ever in an over-the-top performance, but it's the type of performance that's appropriate for such a broad comedy.  Considering he's never done broad comedy before, I have to give my man Jack much kudos.  Sandler pretty much plays the straight man.  Though he's no extraordinary actor, he is talented and can discipline himself when necessary.  Not all comic actors can do that, so you have to give the Sandman credit.  Nevertheless, he still squeezes in some funny lines.  You can expect the usual cameos from fellow SNL alumni like Kevin Nealon and Sandler's longtime buddy Allen Covert, who has a hilarious role as his girlfriend's buddy whom Sandler envies because of his large...endowment.  If the film were dull and without charm, I would dismiss that gag as just plain tasteless, but I found it very funny.Many big actors and celebrities pop up in supporting roles and cameos. John Turturro and Luis Guzman play fellow members of the anger management group. And John C. Reilly has a hilarious role as a Buddhist monk, who later gets the crap kicked out of him.I don't think there was ever a period longer than 3 minutes when I wasn't laughing.  And I'm not talking chuckles, I'm talking real belly laughs! There's even a girl-girl kissing scene.  A barrel of laughs, a girl-girl kissing scene, a wonderful comic performance by Jack Nicholson.  Is there a reason NOT to see this movie?  I didn't think so, so go check it out!

128,gottogorunning,Funny and Entertaining,8,18 August 2005,"I've just seen Anger Management and I'm buzzing. I've read the comments and some reviews beforehand, and thankfully ignored them. There will probably always be criticism on Adam Sandler's movies, and many people hate them, but I can't help wondering what people are complaining about. Okay, his movies don't rank amongst personal favorites such as Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream, but they are entertaining, funny, reasonably original for feel-good-movies (except for the obvious boy gets girl scenario, but hey, even that can be nice from time to time (unless you're a cynic)), full of hilarious cameos and supporting roles, and you can see how much fun all the actors have in playing their roles and that they are having a great time doing these movies. And for me that's all I need if I want to have a good night out. Save the classics for when you're in the mood, and watch these movies once in a while so you don't get too serious about it all. And compare it to all the other comedy trash (romantic or teen) that come out every year and you'll see: in his genre Adam Sandler is in a league of his own. So for all the fans, don't miss out on this one, and for those out there that cannot appreciate it, too bad you don't understand it because you are the ones that are missing the point.",Anger Management

Also, for us guys, this was a particularly good movie for Krista Allen and January Jones, two members of the anger management group. It's funny, and decent. A birthday party kinda movie.",Anger Management
130,jofitz27,"Hilarious, in bizarre way",8,3 February 2005,"Let me just say one thing, before I comment on this film: Jack Nicholson is a star. I've heard bad things about his personality, lifestyle, bla bla bla, but, the fact of the matter is (no matter what kind of selfish bean he may be) he is a remarkably good actor. The way he can put so much life into his character, how he can make you believe this was an actual event, is amazing. He made the terrible ""About Schmidt"" a watchable (barely) film. And in his earlier effort, ""Anger Managemenet"", he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen (including that utterly stupid Gilligan) but, this time (thankfully!) to a brain-bustingly hilarious effect. Dave Buznick is played by Adam Sandler, a calm, relaxed, cool man (despite his ""troublesome"" childhood) who is, after a roll-on-aisles hilarious scene, given ""Anger Managemnt"" therapy for 20 hours, with none other than ""the"" Buddy Rydell. It turns out this two had a past meeting...One great thing about this film, which is rare (sort-of) in comedies, is the acting. John Tutorro plays the hilarious ""Chuck"" anger pal to Dave; Allen Covert (star in basically all of Adam Sandler's movies) plays mr.""big-weener"" Andrew; Jack Nicholson is the unbelievably annoying Buddy, and John Mackenroe even gets off the Tennis courts to make an appearance as a hilarious client to the ""therapy"". Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre male-prostitute car-scene, the gut-burstingly funny scene in the plane, and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible, morally unethical (yet damn funny) scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks. All in all, ""Anger Management"" is a hilarious, annoying, feel good film that deserves to be watched by all. Overall: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)",Anger Management

132,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Anger Management,7,12 April 2003,"From a distance, the poster image of Anger Management doesn't seem to make sense but this film should be an interesting move for both of its stars. Jack Nicholson has been some-what tight cast into Oscar worthy films and hasn't really colored outside the lines which isn't altogether bad but this can make Nicholson look too predictable in his role picking. Adam Sandler, a former Saturday Night Live cast member, had the same tight-casting problems until his role in the P.T. Anderson film, Punch Drunk Love, which really didn't strike a cord with his hard-core fans. Sandler is also coming off the failure of his first (and possibly last) animated endeavor, Eight Crazy Nights. Can Anger Management bring renewed faith in the actors' hard-core group of fans or will it dampen their hopes of redemption after a horrible film?The story goes that a man named Dave Buznik has life all going for him until a horrible incident on an airplane that sends him into the hands of Dr. Buddy Rydell and his anger management class. Dave is usually a very quiet guy who doesn't like to make any kind of public scene which would include kissing his girlfriend in front of a large group of people. All Dave wanted was a pair of head-phones so he could listen to the movie but after several attempts at asking the flight attendant, Dave asks once again and appears to get out of control from the view of others. When Buddy takes Dave under his wing, Dave begins to see that Buddy is just as nuts or even more so then his patients. As hard as he tries, Buddy's program seems to be back-firing and raises new anger in Dave. The story of Anger Management is a mixed bag at best. The story could have gone in a better direction but it is hard to say where exactly. The film starts off too slow at the beginning but starts to pick up after the first twenty minutes.When seeing a film like Anger Management, you really don't expect Oscar worthy acting and you really shouldn't expect anything different with this. Adam Sandler is good actor but much of his funny moments come when he gets angry and somewhat psychotic. It is really hard for any actor to be tight cast but for Sandler, it really works well. Hopefully their will be more opportunities to show off his full range of acting like his role in Punch-Drunk Love. Jack Nicholson is great in this film. In a very rare moment, you get to see Nicholson act in a film just for the fun of it. Most expect him to be placed just in Oscar worthy films and playing sympathetic characters like he portrayed in About Schmidt but he offers something different that may break his mold of tight casting. The other characters in the film never really got to showcase much acting since the films was primarily focused on Sandler and Nicholson but they performed like most Sandler films.Overall, Anger Management is a good comedy but not either Sandler's or Nicholson's best work. Certainly Sandler redeems after the embarrassment of Eight Crazy Nights but there are many out there who would agree that either the Waterboy or Big Daddy were much better then this. The main problem with Anger Management was that it was never really consistent. For the first twenty minutes, the feature starts off really slow but kicks into a big batch of laughs that gets the audience rolling on the floor. After that, it stalls and starts up again several times which makes it a problem for many audience members. Another problem was that many of the main jokes in the film were seen in the trailer and though there were many other jokes, they weren't as funny as the ones that were featured in the trailer. Is it really necessary to draw people to a Sandler film by giving away much of the main jokes in the film? Besides those problems, there were some good things to point out. The level of product placement in this film is a huge notch down from Sandler's previous films which is a bit of a relief. Sure it keeps costs down but it just comes off as cheap to some. The combination of Sandler and Nicholson really works but they aren't given too much to act off of. More then likely, most of the public will go see this film since is that last big film until X2 opens in early May but for those of you still deciding, see it but take caution. The film is a good popcorn flick but nothing extraordinary. Anger Management is definitely, though, a great end to the pre-summer season for movies.My Rating: ***1/2 out of 5",Anger Management

As for this film. it lies somewhere in the middle, not as funny as Sandler can be but not as terrible as some modern comedies can be either.

By the end of the film I was almost angry that I had shelled out six dollars on such a terribly bad film. The previews looked like there was some potential here, and I suppose in the basic premise there was some miniscule amount of potential. Alas, the film did not enough live up to the potential hinted at in the previews.Anger Management stars Adam Sandler as someone who spends most of his time expressing the passive side of a passive/aggressive personality. While on an airplane ride his behaviors are misinterpreted as aggressive and he finds himself facing assault charges in criminal court. What starts out as a huge misunderstanding turns into a sentence of anger management therapy.Enter anger management guru, Buddy Rydell, as played by Jack Nicholson. Frankly, the whole idea of Jack Nicholson as an anger management therapist is pretty funny in and of itself. If you've seen Nicholson going ballistic in Five Easy Pieces, bellowing ""here's Johnny"" in The Shining, snarling ""you can't handle the truth"" in A Few Good Men, or taking over the asylum in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest you know what I'm talking about. Alas, the idea is funnier than the realization, and in the end Nicholson is a great talented wasted on a mediocre story.There are a few bright spots in the film, the best of which is Marisa Tomei as Adam Sandler's girlfriend. I saw part of My Cousin Vinny again recently, and found myself thinking that she actually deserved the Oscar she got for her role in that film. She is a gifted actress and she lights up the screen in almost every scene she is in here. Unfortunately, those scenes are too few to salvage the uninspired story. John Turturro has a few good scenes as a psychopath and John C. Reilly has a few inspired moments as a backyard-bully turned Buddhist monk. In the end these few inspired scenes make for enough good material for a not-so-terrible episode of a thirty-minute sitcom (allowing 12 minutes for commercials). There are also a few funny cameos of real-life celebs in the movie, but collectively they fill about two minutes of screen time. The rest of the time is filled with prepubescent humor and stale sight gags stretched way too thin to carry the film across the finish line.My advice is to find someone with some editing equipment and splice together your own clips from films by Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler (think Waterboy meets A Few Good Men). You'll have more fun and the end result couldn't possibly be any worse than this.",Anger Management
140,Troy2Slick,"A few laughs, nothing more...",3,12 April 2003,"Going into this film, one would be expecting nonstop laughs galore. However, at least not for me, that wasn't the situation. Adam Sandler plays his usual character, yes, however he took a backseat in this film. He cackles on to where you can't even understand what the heck he's mumbling about. He just seems like a robot, waiting for the operator to press the voice synthesis button for his next line of cue. Jack Nicholson was as expected. Not up to par with what he's done in the past, but his characters are always enjoyable. The movie does manage out a few laughs, but there simply aren't enough to make me recommend this movie to anyone. A complete squandering of talent here, if you ask me. Looking for quick paychecks and nothing more. Cameos can't fix this movie either. The ending is the most incoherent mess I've ever witnessed in my entire life. Watch Mr. Deeds, Happy Gilmore, Little Nicky, Waterboy or heck, any other Sandler movie before this one. 1 * out of 4 ****.",Anger Management

142,Zingbot_9000,Sandler gets progressively worse with each movie,3,3 June 2003,"Some say that if you like Adam Sandler than you will like this movie.  I like Adam Sandler and did not like this movie.  Billy Madison that was good, Happy Gilmore that was good, Wedding Singer that was good, Waterboy that was good, after that the movies went downhill.  I don't know if it is Adam getting older (we are the same age) and maturing but he latest movies just aint as clever.  I think I really laughed once during this movie (cupcakes part).  What was funny about the John Turturo character? or the two loving women? Why did John McEnroe even bother? It's cheap humor nowadays for Adam. The movie also could of been funnier.  Adam's character really doesn't have an anger management problem.  And Nicholson is an anger management therapist.  In my opinion it would of been funnier if they both just went nuts on each other.  Nicholson tries to make Sandlers character real mad the whole movie.  He gets him mildly mad but I just think this could of been much funnier.  And it was really corny.  The only thing I have liked about his last couple movies has been watching actors from previous movies pop up in each new movie.So if someone tells you, if you liked Adam Sandlers other movies then you'll like this one.  Don't believe them.  The statement should be did you like Mr Deeds?  If you liked Mr Deeds you will like this one probably but believe me it's not the same Sandler I like.  I guess I like the goofy Sandler (Did like Hot Chick - more like that).",Anger Management

A mild-mannered man is mistaken for a raging maniac in an unconvincing scenario, and he is forced to undergo anger management training.Adam Sandler - eternally unfunny - plays the 'patient', and Jack Nicholson - what was he thinking - plays the therapist.Apparently therapists can live with their patients now, hence the main source of comedy here.

Or anyone who can appreciate the idea of Adam Sandler playing a guy (Dave) who just lets the world trample all over him. All because of one incident when he was a kid. How many of us spend our lives trying to prevent a thing that happened once to us from ever happening again? Dave has spent his life doing just that. Enter Dr. Buddy Rydell. He has quite a way about him that makes you wonder what on earth HE is doing as an anger management specialist. And why does Dave need anger management therapy? He's fully in control of his emotions. It really all was just a misunderstanding. But, somehow, innocent as he is, Dave finds himself railroaded into an anger management course with a man who seems to enjoy being a jerk. Well, Dave will just muddle through it all and wait for it all to end. Oh, boy. It only goes downhill from there. This is not for kids. Anyone with ""homosexual issues"" would not appreciate parts. The absurd humor is great if you like that kind of thing. This one is worth a ton of belly laughs. Look out for cameos. Delightful ones! Casting was great.

145,fullonrobotchubby,"Not a complete strike-out, but oh so close.",4,17 August 2006,"I own this movie, but boy, do I ever have a hard time defending it. Much like the Police Academy films, if you've seen one Adam Sandler movie, you've pretty much seen them all. Anger Management, however, has one element to it nobody should be able to refuse: Jack Nicholson having a blast. In a movie star combo only the insane thought would ever happen, Nicholson plays a shrink (with the customary shrink's beard grown out) who intrudes on Sandler's life, to his dismay, in order to transform him into a gooey ball of sunshine happiness. Strike one with this movie is the ending at Yankee Stadium, when a pathetic twist is revealed that harshly insults its viewers' intelligence. Strike two is the neverending and unnecessary penis envy humor throughout the plot that mostly, ahem, goes limp. These facts sour the movie up, but it's too hard to strike this one out when Nicholson and other celeb cameos provide so much delight. My favorite scene is Sandler's first anger management group session, and it's all because of John Turturro. Turturro has the same knack (only fresher) that Steve Buscemi has for playing the usual goofballs littered throughout a Sandler flick, and in Anger Management, he makes me wish we were all following him and Nicholson instead of fatter, aging, no-longer-hip renegade Sandler. Get past the huge problems (a lot to ask, I know), and you just might appreciate this one.",Anger Management
146,kylopod,Suffers from confusion of purpose,5,28 November 2005,"The best I can say about Adam Sandler's films is that I don't hate them. Unlike many of his detractors, I find his humor dull rather than obnoxious. But I do have one pet peeve regarding his habit of stealing jokes from recent films then executing them poorly. A case in point: I found the 2000 Farrelly Brothers comedy ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" forgettable overall, but it did feature an amusingly irreverent scene in which an African-American dwarf limo driver (Tony Cox, who has made a career out of playing characters like this) goes berserk after a white character played by Jim Carrey offhandedly uses the phrase ""you people"" (in reference to limo drivers, not blacks). Nobody handles material of that sort better than the Farrelly Brothers, and what makes the scene even funnier is that the entire plot hinges on those words carelessly escaping Carrey's lips. This event causes a chain reaction leading to an affair, a divorce, and finally a mental breakdown.The opening scene of ""Anger Management"" features the same joke. Sandler's character utters the phrase ""you people"" in front of a black air marshal, who becomes enraged and zaps Sandler with a taser. The joke here is not in any way pivotal to the plot. It's just thrown redundantly into a sequence in which Sandler is accosted by the airplane crew, who misinterpret his behavior as disruptive.Nevertheless, ""Anger Management"" represents a transition in Sandler's career. He attempts to tone down his persona of the immature man prone to violent outbursts. His character in this film, Dave Buznik, is much more normal and likable than the typical Sandler character. But that's what makes the premise so ironic: ""Anger Management"" is probably the first film in which Sandler plays a guy who doesn't need anger management. So what is Buznik doing being put in such a program? The way he's treated at the beginning on the airplane is inexplicable. It's like a comedy version of Kafka's ""The Trial,"" where a guy is arrested and sentenced for no apparent reason. He acts perfectly sensible most of the time, and it's the world that's turned against him.Sandler does ultimately resort to some of his traditional antics later in the film, like his run-in with an old bully in a sequence that manages to take potshots at both religion and fat people, reminding me once again how much better the Farrelly Brothers are at handling political incorrectness. But Buznik acts this way only because Jack Nicholson's character provokes, manipulates, and blackmails him. In fact, we begin to realize that Nicholson's purpose isn't to help Buznik control his anger, but quite the opposite--to make him stop holding in his emotions and start being more assertive. The program to which Buznik has been sentenced isn't so much anger management as nebbish management.Although Sandler's jokes are as lame as usual, I did enjoy seeing Nicholson here, probably because he appears to be enjoying himself so much. Of all the celebrated American actors, Nicholson may be the one who looks the most comfortable in a comedy. After all, he has long infused his serious parts with a comic touch. I can't imagine any other actor successfully pulling off a character like Dr. Rydell, a hairy, snorty man, the kind of guy who laughs loudly at his own jokes and will talk for hours when everyone is dying to tell him to shut up but is too intimidated to say anything. Amazingly, Nicholson exudes these traits without losing his usual demented charm. He has a fingernails-on-the-blackboard effect only on Buznik, not on the audience.If Nicholson's role doesn't work as well as Robert De Niro's overbearing CIA agent in ""Meet the Parents,"" that can be blamed on the script, which lacks the focus to tell a real story. It seems to structure itself less like a comedy than like a thriller, with continual shifts in the plot as we are asked to ponder Dr. Rydell's true motives. But it's a bluff: the plot twists are just a cheap way of distracting us from the story's lack of content. The final revelation seems too labored for such lightweight material, and only calls attention to the shapeless quality of the earlier scenes.",Anger Management
147,drunken_critic,Pretty funny,8,21 November 2003,"This is the first movie Adam Sandler has made since Punch Drunk Love. Punch Drunk Love was one of my favorite movies of the last year, so it will be unfair to compare his past movie with this one.  He made a good effort in this movie.  His co-star is Jack Nicholson; Who just came off of making the successful About Schmidt.Anger Management is really about the stars.  If the same exact story line were made into a movie with unknown actors, it would not have been so commercially successful.  That is all right, I enjoy watching Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson practice their craft.  Their acting abilities of intensity and humor are what made them so successful.  These actors have the ability to turn a stale script into a good movie.  I feel that is what they did on this movie.  They made it better just by participating in the movie. I enjoyed watching them interact, and watch their chemistry.  It is rare, but these stars made the movie good.It was about Adam getting assigned to an anger management class for a falsely accused outburst on an airplane, and he keeps getting falsely accused of anger throughout the movie.  His anger management supervisor is Jack.  Adam has to pass his program to have charges dropped against him. In the end it all ends up being fake.  It was designed with the help of his girlfriend to give Adam a wake up call.

148,ElmStreetsLastBrat,"Not Adam Sandler's best, but still really funny!",6,26 February 2007,"""Anger Management"" from 2003 isn't Adam Sandler's best film, but it is still really funny. I love this film. Adam Sandler plays Dave Buznick, an executive assistant at a pet products company. He's accused of having anger issues when he yells at a flight attendant for not getting his headset right away. So he's assigned a couple of weeks of anger management classes. And it just so happens that Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) is the teacher of the class. And he was the one who Dave was sitting next to on the plane. So when the classes don't work for Dave, Buddy decides to move in with Dave so he can be closer to Dave to make sure his anger is repressed, or ""retarded"", as Buddy would put it. And Buddy does all that he can to make Dave's life miserable. He sleeps with him in the same bed. NAKED. And he even tries to steal his girl. But the twist is: this was all a set up to get Dave to ask his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) to marry him. Sure this twist was a little unnecessary but the film was still really funny. I loved Jack Nicholson as Buddy Rydell. He has that menacing and intimidating look about him and that made him perfect as the anger management teacher. He has those intense stares that make you afraid to say the wrong thing to him. And he's not in a lot of comedies so it was refreshing to see him in a film like this. Adam Sander is his usual funny self. His character Dave was no different from all his other characters but he still makes me laugh with his wide eyes and shaky voice. And he always looks like he's about to crack up laughing and I like that about him too. John C. Reilly had a funny cameo as a Buddhist monk who was Dave's childhood tormentor in school. He is a great comedic actor. John Tuturro had one of the best cameos as one of the students in the anger management class who really did have some anger issues. Every line he said was funny. Anything anybody said to him would set him off. Loved his character! And Luis Guzman was perfect as a sexually ambiguous hispanic guy who also had anger issues. I'm not a particular fan of Marisa Tomei so I didn't care for her character Linda. She's just not one of the best actresses out there in my opinion. But overall I loved this film and it was so funny. Kept me laughing and none of the jokes fell flat. Adam Sandler is one of my favorite comedic actors. Thank you for reading my review!",Anger Management

Now in case you think I am too fussy I don't mind some language and sexual content is fine if it is either comical or dramatic.

152,sloopydrew,Nicholson and Sandler deserved better than this ...,4,12 April 2003,"Anger Management starts out with the trademark screwball hi-jinks that we've grown familiar with in past Sandler films.  There is a hysterical scene on an airplane where a particularly annoying stewardess (are there any other kind?) ... er, ""flight attendant"" keeps telling mild-mannered Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler), who is doing nothing more than asking for a pair of earphones, that the country is going through ""sensitive times"" and that he needs to calm down.  The scene plays out perfectly, and by the time it was over I had already decided that this would, more likely than not, be the best Adam Sandler movie to date.Due to the hyper-sensitive stewardess, Mr. Buznik is put before Judge Daniels (Lynne Thigpen), fined a large sum of money and required to take 20 hours of anger management courses.  He finds out that his class will be taught by Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).  Rydell sat next to Buznik on the plane where the incident occurred, and was actually the catalyst for Buznik's request for the earphones.  Buznik is relieved to see that Buddy is his anger management doctor, and asks the doc to sign his papers and let him out of the class.  Dr. Rydell lets Dave know that he can't sign over the papers until Buznik has attended at least one anger management course. Buznik reluctantly agrees.   It isn't long after his first anger management course with Buddy that Buznik winds up accidentally hitting a cocktail waitress with a blind man's cane and finds himself back in the courtroom of Judge Daniels.  This time the judge, tired of looking at Buznik's face, dishes out some serious punishment.  Lucky for Dave Buznik, Dr. Buddy Rydell shows up at just the right time and saves the day.  Rydell sweet talks the judge into giving Buznik a chance to avoid prison time if he is able to spend 30 days with the doctor and successfully complete an intensive form of anger management therapy. In a rather unorthodox therapeutic approach, the good doctor ends up moving in with Buznik, going as far as to share his patient's bed.  From that point on, hilarity follows, right?  Wrong.  Chuckle worthy moments throughout the rest of the film are surprisingly sparse.  Anger Management, like every Sandler movie since Big Daddy, turns into a romantic comedy rather than remaining a balls out comedy.  This time, the ""romantic"" part of the equation, featuring Marisa Tomei as David Buznik's girlfriend Linda, is almost intolerable.  I was thrown for a loop by this, being that Tomei proved herself a comedic actor to the tune of an Academy Award in 1992's My Cousin Vinny.  In Anger Management, she is the one person without a single funny line.  The only person to provide any teeth in this picture is Jack Nicholson. Although this is one of his weakest jobs as an actor, he almost makes the sugary-sweet romantic concoction conjured up by David Dorfman possible to swallow.  But, by the time it's over, even Nicholson's wild eyed performance winds up being detrimental to the overall film.  By leaving all the lunacy up to Jack, Adam Sandler is forced, for the first time in his career, to play the straight man - it absolutely doesn't work.Every ingredient to make Anger Management the best Sandler picture flick yet is set firmly in place.  Unfortunately, Sandler never quite finds his comedy chops.  Even Jack Nicholson appears defanged when you compare him with his craziest work in films like The Shining, or mediocre comedies that he's appeared in, such as The Witches of Eastwick.  I think that the producers figured that, once they had Nicholson on board, everything else would simply fall into place.  It's hard to blame them.  I also thought that with Sandler and Nicholson starring together, Anger Management could do no wrong.  Unfortunately it did, and I'm going to need anger management to get over how upset I am that the two of them together couldn't come up with something better than this halfhearted excuse for a comedy.",Anger Management

With Jack Nicholson doing what he does best: playing a complete psycho; and a more edgy and better premise. This looked like it could have been a redemption for Sandler's streak of crappy movies.It started out good, and don't get me wrong, this movie isn't a terrible movie. Jack Nicholson was a riot and the movie was daring to go beyond the PG-13 rating. There were also plenty of hilarious cameos and bit parts, such as Guzman and Turturro. Woody Harrelson is HILARIOUS as a transvestite named Galaxia trying to seduce Sandler. He's probably the funniest one in the movie.Ultimately the film falls apart at the ending. After all of the pieces fall together, that makes the events before far less amusing and it would have been funnier if the characters were to remain the same instead of having some sort of ending revelation.That being said, if you're sick of Adam Sandler's bad movies, this is quite refreshing for the first 7/8 of it, but don't expect much from the ending.

159,McHuevo,"Best Adam Sandler movie since ""Big Daddy""",7,7 June 2003,"It's funny how many of us use the term ""Adam Sandler movie"" more and more consistently. As I said before: Sandler has managed to do this kind of comedies, make them his own and get away with it. I have to say, I generally like Sandler's kind of campy, exaggerated movies. Now they added a Jack Nicholson to the recipe, and I was wondering: can this possibly work? To my relief and amazement, the answer was YES.There's a reason for Jack Nicholson to be one of my favorite actors of all time: he floods the screen with his personality, he can be the scariest villain or the funniest looney ever. He is simply the best. I liked the fact that Nicholson was given the first credit; it is a wide spread tendency these days to put one of these youngsters preceding a well-know movie legend (Keanu Reeves before Pacino, Banderas before Hopkins or Affleck before Freeman, to name a few).In ""Anger Management"" Nicholson plays Buddy Ridell, an anger management therapist trying to ""help"" Dave Buznik (Sandler) get over his  problems by the hard way... the VERY hard way. That is IF Buznik has any behavior problems at all. Ah well, if he didn't have any he's about to.Sandler and Nicholson make a very funny on-screen duo. Both fit in those characters to perfection. Nicholson being a world class know-it-all completely insane therapist and Sandler the shy guy with occasional rage outbursts, which we all know he has mastered over the years, in his own kind of way.I wish there was a 7.5 rating option in this website.

Will asking an air stewardess politely for some headphones lead to the threat of encarceration? Jack Nicholson's role as the demented anger management therapist is by turns belly-bustingly hilarious and anxiously unnerving. Performers of the calibre of John Turturro are underused in near-cameo roles as fellow anger patients.*SPOILER* In fact the film's greatest weakness is that it doesn't go all the way with the black comedy of anger. Instead of more laughs with the psychos in the therapy class, the film moves into a more sentimental mode for the second half, where Sandler worries about keeping the love of his girlfriend. Then, in the final scene, the rug is pulled from under the feet of the whole film when the premise is revealed as a ploy to put Sandler into therapy and make him propose. For me, this undermines the dark humour that is the film's forte. A bolder filmmaker would have carried the film to its logical, illogical conclusion that the world is mad and the only way to survive is to let it know how you feel.*Spoiler ENDS* Overall a very, very entertaining film with many laugh out loud moments, possibly one of Jack Nicholson's best efforts in his recent ""comedy"" repertoire.",Anger Management

The story is clever, the ending is clever (better than something some whiners here could come up with, that's for sure) and the dialogue and acting is even better.The pacing is high, there are no unnecessary or boring scenes.I have seen the flight scene several times and the therapy scenes are also absolutely brilliant. And the traffic disturbance scene. And the bar scene... You get the picture.Adam Sandler is actually very good in this movie. Anger Management shows that good directing and a good story can reveal hidden talent.Jack Nicholson is good as always. He was perfect for this role.But I have to mention John Turturro, even though he only has a small role. This guy can act, drama or comedy does not matter. He is very good here. I think he should get more and bigger roles.Anger Management is for you who like odd people and people getting into uncomfortable situations. It's for you who demand more than Rat Race or Johnny English. (Rowan Atkinson was funny as Mr. Bean and Black Adder in small doses on TV, but his movies sucks.)My rating is 10/10, according to the IMDb rating system, of course. This is a movie I will see several times.",Anger Management

He has to meet the specialist Dr. Rydell who is everything but normal and changes his life in every respect...""Anger Management"" is a typical Adam Sandler comedy. Only the main advantage to his other works is Jack Nicholson who again proves himself as excellent. It must have been hard to succeed in a leading role against this contra-part, who so much seems to enjoy his role. Only in the end Nicholson stepped a little backwards probably to let Sandler get his showdown.In a short: Funny story, Nicholson does a great job and there are some scenes you won't forget (a very ""pretty"" duet for example) which I think is one important thing that makes movies worth watching !",Anger Management

He's brilliant in this movie, and as ever so often, you're never quite sure whose side he's really on. Adam Sandler plays the ever so innocent guy, seemingly being taken advantage of everyone around him. His character is lovable, and I could hardly imagine a better actor for this role.I wanted something light for Sunday evening, something to entertain me and make me laugh, and I certainly got what I was looking for. A funny movie with some hilarious scenes and not overdoing it on the slapstick. And even with a little twist at the end, with a certain ""ahaa"" effect.",Anger Management
166,spectre316-1,"In a word, embarrassing.",1,18 November 2003,"Sure, his other films were quite dumb, and even badly made -- but they made me laugh. That's the big difference here. This movie takes the standard Sandler formula, removes the possibility of any laughs, and even lessens the quality of direction/acting/screenwriting from previous efforts (admittedly, not that much) to an even smaller scale.Anyone with an IQ above 30 should be convinced that this is a complete piece of crap by the time the wimpy, cliched finale (involving a proposal during a baseball game, nonetheless) appears on the screen. Does Sandler even read these scripts? How is it possible that this is the guy who did ""Punch-Drunk Love""?Want to hear me rant some more? Okay! Well, for one thing, the main character played by Adam Sandler is a one note, boring person. I could of cared a less about him. Sandler, aside from ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" really needs to move on. It's the same character from his other films, but more quiet. And more boring.Second -- the direction doesn't fit very well. When incredibly low expectations are not met, there's got to be some reason. Especially since this is the guy who did a fairly successful ""Naked Gun"" sequel and ""Tommy Boy,"" which seems to be somewhat of a cult classic. Both of those films may have not been masterpieces in any way, but they sure were funny. Even if only occasionally.Third -- the very, very ending. I'm not talking about the ""surprise twist"" (which is pretty lame as well), but just the scene where all of the characters are assembled and act stupid. You know, I love John Turturro, really (""Barton Fink"" is one of my favorite movies of all time), but his character, and especially in this scene, running around screaming ""Grenada!"" and all that, just made me want to throw the TV across the room.Forget embarrassing -- this movie is simply an insult to anyone with a brain.",Anger Management

Immature humour. A primary plot line which permits the script and screenplay to take absolutely bizarre, and consequently unbelievable, turns makes this film a roller coaster ride. And yes, some will puke.Bottom, willy, plums, boobies.Oh dear, I've just spoilt a dozen or so jokes by effectively telling you their punchlines.Worst of all, despite the unpredictableness designed into the story, much of it is predictable. The impractical jokes that the lead characters play on each other being primary examples.If there's one positive thing to say about the film it's that it never pretended to be anything apart from a throwaway comedy, and it indeed succeeds in that end.

It has some of my favourit actors, like Jack Nicholson, Woody Harrelson, John Turturro, John C. Reilly, Luis Guzman and even a great cameo by John McEnroe.But here's the flaw: Adams Sandler is in it. You know, that overrated guy with no talent, acts even worse than an amateur with no experience, brings nothing new to his character, looks the same as ever (thank goodness he is not wearing a cheap dollar store wig in this one) and is never, ever convincing as a character with anger issues. He's just being Adam Sandler. Only the name of his character is different. Same haircut as ever, same attitude as ever, thinking he's a funny guy. And he is no funny guy. He never is.That's why I've got mixed feelings about this movie.

It doesn't need a master plot with twists and an impeccable script to be good. Nicholson plays a great outside the box therapist that has to work with Sandler who really doesn't have anger management issues. It's funny because of the personalities of the characters played by Nicholson and Sandler. The scenarios in which they get into are funny as well. Beating up a monk at a monastery, hitting a woman with a blind mans cane, stopping in the middle of traffic to sing ""I feel pretty"". It's pretty amusing to me, but I guess that's because I don't fancy myself as a top notch film critic like some on here 🙄",Anger Management

This movie is truly funny (and not for just one scene like the fight with Bob Barker in Happy Gilmore), and not because of Sandler. Sandler plays the straight man and is quite adequate in the role. The lovely Marissa Tomei is excellent as usual, but the star of the film is Jack Nicholson.Sure, Jack is a big star, but he's played in many bad movies. This isn't one of them. This role was made for him and he took it to the limits. He certainly showed off his acting ability in many extremes (happy, girlie, angry, and cocky). This is definitely one of Jack's better movies.This is a comedy, and one that will have most people laughing out loud and wriggling in their seats. All despite Adam Sandler.Kudos to Jack!",Anger Management
171,lbk,The ending ends it for this one,6,12 January 2005,"If it wasn't for the ending it would have passed as an average enjoyable film courtesy of Jack Nicholson. The plot is OK thought out but is never surprising or truly intelligent. We get a bit of Cuckoos Nest, a bit of Shining, a bit of Endearment, a bit of this and that but nothing done beyond soap standards.Most impressing was the fat cat that could sit still for so long. At first I thought it was a prop. But I guess they fed the poor create so much it couldn't budge while shooting. The physical jokes are surely a riot for fourth grade children.The ending at the baseball game is trite and nauseatingly sentimental, true Hollywood at its worst. What a stinker! It kills whatever sympathy was accumulated for this film until the final scenes. Why do American film makers grope the audience with such repulsive sentimentality?",Anger Management

They know we like his eccentricity, his roughish style, the glint of the devil in his eye.Unfortunately the old guy has allowed his distinguished career to be packaged and regurgitated it in one film too many.This is just a typically silly Sandler genre film with Jack thrown in to boost the box office.The phrase Jacksploitation springs to mind. Sadly, we can only assume Jack was a willing participant in this parody.It was one of those films that starts badly but you expect it to be rescued as it develops.

There really is probably only one reason they were in this movie--for the paycheck. What a terrible, terrible film. It's highly uncomfortable to watch, features very bad Three Stooges humor, and is completely unrealistic. I don't mind stupid movies if they're funny, but this had only one funny minute in the whole film. If you feel some great need to see it, catch it on video. Just remember that you can't get those two hours of your life back. It's simply dreadful--full of exaggeration, stupid stereotypes, and cued movie music that tells you how you're supposed to feel. It's basically a typical big-budget Hollywood movie trying to take your money without giving you any real entertainment in return.

182,Spacetree,You'll be Angry you wasted 90+ minutes on this,1,9 April 2005,"I suppose Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson decided that they would just have fun with a movie. That this time, they wouldn't take the time to put a conceivable plot, interesting characters, or even mediocre comedy in a movie.Oh, wait, they've done movies like that before.Anger Management truly made made angry, just for the mere fact that the writers, after cramming the movie full of nonsensical scenes and plot twists that were (for a lack of a better word) stupid, decided to tie it all together with the old stand by, the Deus ex Machina. Surprise, surprise, it was all a scheme cleverly concocted by Sandler's girlfriend, a court judge, and a respected psychologist.It's insulting enough to the audience that the plot was this god-awful, but I would've been able to stand it if they hadn't filled the movie slapstick humor and running gay jokes (or if Sandler hadn't gone with his standard ""nice-idiot"" routine perfected in Waterboy, Little Nicky, and Mr. Deeds and actually made a likable character). For a production with this much star-power behind it, I was sorely disappointed with the results.",Anger Management
183,Ziman,Sandler and Nicholson... together (at last?),7,18 April 2003,"Dave Buznik (played by Sandler) is a VERY mild mannered businessman (cat-clothing designer), with a comfortable lifestyle, and a pretty girlfriend.  And whether he knows it or not, he also has an anger problem. 
A severely misunderstood incident during a business flight causes him to be sentenced to anger management treatment, under the direction and supervision of the renowned (and published) Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson)  who seemingly has some problems of his own.  The pairing of these two is not a welcome one for Buznik, since he doesn't see a true problem.  But of course, that is what gives the plot its motivation  Someone who doesn't need (or want) the medicine, but is sentenced to have it forced down his throat and at times under duress.Although it leans toward the tradition of the mis-matched buddy flick, which can often times be too predictable, Anger Management has many unique and very funny moments throughout.  The differences between what Buznik wants versus what Rydell demands of him often leads Buznik into some very bizarre encounters and experiences.  For a guy who seems to have his life in order, misaligned therapy might be the worst thing for him at this point.But not only are the characters mis-matched types one might think the actors are too.  At first thought, whomever conceived the idea of putting Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler together in a movie would get the word `INSANE' tattooed across his/her forehead but this match up really works. Nicholson has a broad ability to deliver pretty much whatever type of role is demanded of him.  Be it a serious role, or a comedic role, or the role of a crazed lunatic Nicholson can deliver.  His portrayal of Buddy Rydell is no different in fact it might be a bit of everything he's ever done (at the same time being nothing like anything he's ever done).Adam Sandler on the other hand, has a knack for playing the part of a circus clown in most of his movies.  His career, up to just recently were low-end, second-class comedies.   However, Sandler is growing up.  Punch Drunk Love was a different taste of Sandler that we haven't quite seen before, and one that was well done for him.  But, just when you thought there was some hope for Sandler's mature talent Mr. Deeds hits theaters.  Not to say there isn't a place for those types of films, but Sandler is capable of so much more.  And he redeems himself in this movie.  He still delivers comedy and does it well, and he does it with a more mature and serious demeanor.It's almost as if that during the making of this film, Sandler was feeding off Nicholson's aura' of a long-time professional actor and using it to his advantage while at the same time letting Nicholson play the part of the clown.  It's not a perfect film, but it's certainly entertaining and is one of the better comedies I've seen in the past couple of years and again, Nicholson and Sandler on screen together are a perfect duo in this film.  This film is definitely recommended viewing.",Anger Management

Seriously, I was drunk enough that I even chuckled at parts of the preview for Daddy Day Care.This wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, still, it wasn't the worst, either. However, Adam Sandler is in over his head; let's review the cast:Jack Nicholson: Three Oscars, Twelve Nominations, appeared in films like The Shining Marisa Tomei: One Oscar, Two Nominations, appeared in films like Chaplin Adam Sandler: Nominated for an MTV movie award for Billy Madison and appeared in films like Going OverboardWell, obviously I was wrong, Sandler fits in perfectly.I could explain the plot in great detail, but why bother. Dave Buznik (Sandler) doesn't lash out uncontrollably at anyone who pisses him off, so he obviously has a problem. When he is upset at a stewardess, he's arrested and is remanded to the care of Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson). Lots of filler and cameos ensue. Will Dave finally unleash his Fist of the North Star? Will he make a ridiculous marriage proposal in the middle of security guards at a Yankees Game? Will Linda (Tomei) say yes? Will Daddy Day Care gross more than the last 5 Eddie Murphy films combined? Here's a tip: save yourself $8 and just guess. These aren't tough questions.I thought this movie was funny, but keep in mind that I giggled at Daddy Day Care.",Anger Management
186,rogerebertsclone,Mixed feelings...Punch Drunk with Anger,6,11 April 2003,"The marketing for this movie made Jack look like the psychotic one (""I SAID OVER EASY!!!""), but his role is quite the opposite. Jack plays a subtle, calm, and collected doctor who slowly but surely pushes Sandler to reveal his anger (which is used to great potential in the Monk scene, but that's it). Had I known Jack's handle on the role before I walked into the movie, I may have liked it a little more. I was expecting Jack in a role crazier than his ""Joker"" (anyone remember 'Batman'???). Gripe aside, Jack is very amusing and nearly steals the screen from Sandler. Tuturro and Guzman aren't given a lot of time to expand their characters to nothing more than borderline offensive stereotypes. The supporting characters are more or less walk-on roles. ""Anger's"" laughs roll out slow but it begins to pick up momentum when Buddy (Nicholson) moves in with Dave (Sandler). This didn't seem like a Sandler movie. There were cameos, yes. Some were really bad (Ted Knight can't be himself) and good ones (Woody Harrelson never looked so weird) There was no crazy, oddball humor like ""Waterboy"" or ""Happy Gilmore"". This is a movie that is more palatable to Nicholson fans. Is Sandler playing the same nice guy character with rage? Yes, but to extent. Sandler never really takes off with his anger. He just makes constipated faces and curses. Do Sandler and Nicholson have chemistry? Yes. The ending may leave you either angry or just plain boggled but it's nothing to whine over. This is a comedy, not ""Vanilla Sky."" The movie won't bring belly laughs. There were times when I laughed because couldn't believe Nicholson was saying or doing things that were in reference to his past. For Sandler, this seems like ""Punch Drunk Love"" -- the goofy comedy. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not as laugh out loud as it could have been. Don't go in expecting Jack losing his cool because he doesn't. Don't go in expecting Sander beating up people ""Happy Gilmore""-style (with the exception of the monk scene). I'm mixed on my verdict. This is Sandler's most 'mature' comedy since 'Billy Madison.' There's singing, there's some weird stuff (Jack's fried hair), but Sandler's unique touch of humor seemed to have been lost in the editing room. This is Sandler lite. If you want his brand of craziness, nothing tops ""Little Nicky."" Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad film at all. There are laughs to be found in ""Anger"". Probably the funniest film so far this year. In terms of Sandler, it seems like he's holding back. As for Jack? He's great in this, psychotic free. I'll have to watch this once again, now knowing what I know. That damn marketing department.",Anger Management

189,Drake_Clawfang,You can see it coming,7,14 January 2006,"Jack Nicholson drives the movie, pushing poor Adam Sandler to the edge. Jack played Buddy Rydel, an anger management therapist with some...questionable methods. His method of 'curing' Dave's anger problem is to provoke Dave (Sandler) until Dave snaps and loses it. And oddly enough, after Buddy explains 'implosive and explosive' anger problems, his methods actually make sense! Little gags and jokes make the movie great. Buddy is, as Dave says, a psycho, but what can you expect from the man who starred in The Shining? And the various members of the support group do their part as supporting cast. A surprising absence is Rob Schinder, although his trademark line 'You can do it!' is in the movie.Overall, you can actually see the ending coming. I won't spoil it, but anyone with an IQ over 50 can tell that there is most certainly something wrong. The set-up is convincing, although Buddy does take it a bit too far when he claims he gave Dave's girlfriend a '10-second frencher'. Dave eventually learns that he can't keep his anger bottled up. One gets the feeling that Dave was based on Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. Picture Homer schooling Ned on how to control anger, and you'll get this movie. Buddy himself has some issues to work out, but again, what can you expect from Jack Nicholson? A great movie.

Punch Drunk Love should have taught me a lesson - gawd that was horrible!  This movie had one really funny scene and that was all....[In the courtroom.]  I love comedy more than any other genre but this was pathetic and contrived.

199,Holitao,Mildly funny movie about a man who gets wrongfully sent to a anger therapist.,6,21 April 2003,"Although ""Anger Management"" is seeing a huge box office success, I wonder how many of its viewers are walking out feeling much left to be satisfied. Continuing on his anger-ridden character(Punch-Drunk Love), Sandler collaborates with Nicholson and pulls off a mildly-funny movie about a man setup by his girlfriend, who seeks a anger management expert to help with their stagnant relationship.  Cameos by Woody Harrelson and Heather Graham are funny but sparring and even with Nicholson's charm the movie struggles to find its comical pulse.  [Rating - 6/10]",Anger Management

As to be expected, this would be another misdirected salute to and a grand celebration of mis-management and mal-administration on a colossal scale . A punishment of the innocent and a rewarding of the guilty of biblical order and proportion. A fair share of our artistic and administrative landscape in keeping with our environmental landscape is littered with expensive but worthless garbage. No more is there genuine humor in real life circumstances and in real life situations involving real life people having to put up with and having to manage , having to contend and to cope, bravely, spiritedly and cheerfully, if not also skillfully and successfully with real life problems ? No more does genuine good humor exist at all all around us, as also in us ? No more, do we have the knack for seeing people and things for who and what they really are ?",Anger Management

The storyline was kind of predictable, with the classic girl that Adam Sandler is going after and get's sidtracked by some lunatic. (In Happy Gilmore, there was the famous golfer and in Big daddy there was that stupid annoying kid) And of course everything turns out fine. The beginning was horrible, mind you the rest of the movie was good. The bashing of gays and lesbians wasn't too appealing either... They didn't really bash them as much as they made them look like dirty, sex-driven perverts who wanted to do nothing but make asses of themselves. When i saw the pert about the transvestite, i almost fell out of my chair!

I expected him to kick the butts of everyone in the movie with his massive talent, but here he proves something very interesting, that a great actor without a great script flounders and isn't that great. Sandler (Little Nicky) is refining his persona, but I think he's also limiting it by working with the same actors in every film. The cameos become like a Love Boatepisode, you spend half your time saying ""Isn't that Woody Harrelson?"" ""Hey,there's Turturro, he played the butler in Adams last film"" and that's fun for a while, but wears thin and you're left with the plot.Such as it is.There's nothing new here, really, and nothing that funny either. It's okay, I guess, if you like the stars.

One of the things that irritate me about his performances is his voice. Can he not talk like a normal human being or does he have some kind of speech impediment? If that is the case, I suggest he get help from a speech therapist. I can only assume that the positive comments on this movie were written by the distributors or their agents.

You'll end up more relaxed and perceptive to the beauty and strength of a healthy life. Nicholson is as usually, majestically. Marissa is as usually, sweet and warm like a home-baked pie and Sandler is as usually, melting to an ideal human form, his role. Nothing out of the ordinary there.

Most of this movie drags, and what could be solid scenes (the airplane seat problem, for instance) fall flat. There are far too few laughs for this to hold up.Sandler does a fine job as a repressed doormat, but there aren't many laughs there.  Jack Nicholson is, at times, brilliant as the flamboyant, unconventional, angry anger coach.  But usually, he is just going through the motions as well.  Mostly, both of these men are stuck in a poorly written script with no help from the director.The premise is funny enough, but the dialog is often mundane and the situations unexplored.  Why do we go along on the first ride to work?  The explosive situation in that scene ended up on the cutting room floor, but the rest of the scene was kept and reduced to a lame comment about running a red light.And a fistfight in a monastery?  Come on!Fun cameos by various famous angry men provide some chuckles, but they are far too few to save a limp script.  Trite, banal, and mostly a bore.",Anger Management

It's one of the movies, which's trailer consists of all jokes of the movie :-)+ i cannot understand why Sandler is still used as a comedy actor.

All the jokes in this film are coherent and managed to be executed with good precision. Sandler's character is relateable for once and all the pitfalls that usually ruin his films are avoided in this film.If you are really against Adam Sandler, try and think of this as a Jack Nicholson film. It's Nicholson who really steals the film with his performance as a semi-crazed anger management coach with a taste for musicals.

And in watching this movie it is easy to see some of that floating around. But, opposite Jack Nicholson, a bit of growth is given to his comedy and it finds a happy medium.I had the benefit of having watched the last half of the movie a while back before today, when I watched it from the beginning. Normally that would hinder ones outlook on the movie – but not this one. I watched today with my boyfriend and my best friend. My best friend and I knew the ending, but my boyfriend had never seen it before. About a half hour in he was staring at the screen with a weird look on his face. When I asked him what was wrong he said something along the lines of ""I thought this was supposed to be a realistic type movie I'm not sure what's going on.""Now, my boyfriend is a bright man so I tried to see it from his point of view. That's when the epiphany hit. If I had watched this from beginning to end I would have hated it. I would have thought it was a dumb and dumber rip off only worse. Yet if they had made the movie any differently it would have sucked. Interesting, right?So here's my advice to you. Go find the movie. Rent it, watch it on TV, buy it, whatever. Then before you watch the whole movie, watch just the ending. Then you'll figure out what I mean.",Anger Management

Nicholson arrives just in time to lift a rather slim storyline. There are a lot of funny moments, but it just ends up getting repetitive after a while. There's only so much a Sandler-film-viewer can tolerate, you know. I'm not going to give any of the plot away. You can pretty much guess what it'd be after the first couple of minutes after the movie starts. But only when the story becomes totally clichéd that Nicholson steps in to lift the movie with his bare hands. It is only him and Marisa Tomei that lift the film from the bottom and make it somewhat watchable. Adam Sandler is an actor with so much potential, but ends up making rom-coms and plainly senseless comedies. I'd love to see him in a role similar to the one in Punch Drunk Love for which he actually got nominated for a Golden Globe. He can act. There was never any doubt in that.

But I'm a mouthy old broad and want to have my say.This movie is a POS. It's stupid. It doesn't make sense. I didn't laugh once (I'm all for sophomoric and politically incorrect humor--but this movie didn't even reach the standard for sophomoric and politically incorrect humor). Adam Sandler is improbably forced into anger management on trumped up charges, not knowing he's the victim of a conspiracy theory. His anger management meeting is attended by criminally insane paranoid schizophrenics. Funny, huh? That's the first 20 minutes. It goes downhill from there.I read the other ""I hate it"" reviews and didn't see this mentioned once. The actors in this movie look like death warmed over--and I was NOT watching on a high def TV. I couldn't believe how horrible Nicholson, Turrturo and Marisa Tomei looked. Bloodshot, watery eyes, their skin was a color you don't usually see outside of a mortuary and I don't know if the crew was missing a hairdresser or what.The fact that Adam Sandler is continuously financially rewarded for churning out this sort of crap is proof to me there is no God.",Anger Management

I've read the comments and some reviews beforehand, and thankfully ignored them. There will probably always be criticism on Adam Sandler's movies, and many people hate them, but I can't help wondering what people are complaining about. Okay, his movies don't rank amongst personal favorites such as Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream, but they are entertaining, funny, reasonably original for feel-good-movies (except for the obvious boy gets girl scenario, but hey, even that can be nice from time to time (unless you're a cynic)), full of hilarious cameos and supporting roles, and you can see how much fun all the actors have in playing their roles and that they are having a great time doing these movies. And for me that's all I need if I want to have a good night out. Save the classics for when you're in the mood, and watch these movies once in a while so you don't get too serious about it all. And compare it to all the other comedy trash (romantic or teen) that come out every year and you'll see: in his genre Adam Sandler is in a league of his own.

Its not challenging, but when you put the type of comedy it is into context, its actually pretty watchable barring some annoying scenes. It has a great cast- Sandler is good, Jack Nickolson is my favourite actor of all time, Marrissa Tomei is gorgeous and everything you would want in a girlfriend. She could probably have done with a bigger role as she is a superb actress. There are some good cameo roles also. The positives in the movie is first of all, Sandler's best movie by a distance and his personality in the movie appeals as he is likable. Nickolson makes everything tick as far as i'm concerned, he is completely insane and makes everything he does hilarious by his unbelievable facial expressions.There is also signs of good on-screen comic chemistry between Nicholson and Sandler. Also it is a great movie for yankee fans like me, seeing Jeter and co. and the main showing of affection from Sandler towards Mareisa centres around a wedding proposal at yankee stadium. I couldn't possibly dislike the movie.From a critical standpoint the movie can fall down at points.The movie gives the impression that it is complicated with a multi faceted script but actually in reality its pretty flimsy. The Budhist scene is an example of stupidity, harmless stupidity but it was annoying. And the plot towards the end reaches preposterous levels of implausibility which prevents the movie from being wholly satisfying. To sum up, individually the performances are very good. Also in moments there are excellent comedic points. The ""goose frabba"" joke was very smart and very funny especially when repeated by Yankee players at the end. John McEnroe attending anger management with Nicholson was also a great touch. And lets not forget the cameo's and the great cast of characters involved in the anger management group. The ending was so satisfying in a feel good way that you have got to enjoy it and as Sandler declares at the stadium- ""GO YANKEES!""",Anger Management

231,sebrat,Trying Hard to Manage my Anger,3,12 November 2005,"The movie Anger Management leaves something to be desired in the area ofwell, everything you see in a good movie. It is badly scripted, not funny and above all, Adam Sandler is the most annoying actor since Woody Allen first hit the screens. The horrible, stuttering Dave (Sandler) is not an entertaining  far from giving a vivid sketch of his character, it simply makes him annoying to watch and I found myself reaching for the remote control's 'volume up' button on more than one occasion.However, despite Sandler's shocking performance (as per his other films), one person who did lighten the film up slightly was Jack Nicholson. Despite this, I found this to be his worst film. It was obvious he was trying to make the best of his shockingly UN-funny lines and he did a fantastic job of getting into character.Anger Management is a very self-explanatory title. It is a story that revolves around Dave Buznick (Sandler) who is sent to Anger Management after having an argument with an air hostess. Once there, Doctor Buddy Rydell (Nicholson) immediately begins to wind Buznick up and get him to commit acts of angry behaviour. After singing I Feel Pretty on Williamsburg Bridge, going on a blind date in Boston, insulting his boss, beating up his childhood bully, breaking up with his girlfriend and seeing Rydell take her for his own, Buznick wins back his girlfriend at a Yankee game.However, having watched this three times, I still cannot comprehend the ending. The girlfriend explains to Buznick after their engagement that the whole thing was a set up, forgetting to mention one crucial point  'WHY'. The movie ends with a terrible scene which was clearly not written by the same people (it was in a class of its own, somewhere between other Sandler movies and Daddy Day Care).If I had to give my favourite part, it would have to be the one in which Rydell and Buznick are trying to get out of a car park at the top of a multi-story complex. A car is parked directly behind them so Rydell, cool as anything, gets out of the car, tests the weight between a baseball bat and a golf club, picks the baseball bat, smashes the window of the car and turns the brakes off. Getting back into his car, he then pushes it down the car elevator shaft. It's not a fantastic scene, but it is the best in this monotonously mediocre movie.I would personally recommend this movie to younger audiences with a taste for silly humour, not somebody who likes subtle or dry humour. It is very 'in-your-face', too much so for an adult audience. My age range is probably around eight to fifteen.So, as a summary, this movie was pretty bad. It was the crumbling house being held up by Nicholson with Sandler sitting on the roof admiring the view. Good luck getting through this movie without falling asleep  it has a slow pace and would probably be a good fifty minutes shorter if Sandler spoke normally.",Anger Management

All in all however this movie fell short.  There were some funny scenes but the plot was forced, and the ending was overly cheesy, well over the top, and a huge stretch.  It also seemed to be indecisive about what type of film it was trying to be and this weakened its calibur as well. As a huge fan of Sandler and Nicholson in a variety of genres I can appreciate a good turn-your-brain-off comedy as well as a more defined romantic comedy, but this one seemed to fall somewhere in between and it really didn't work.

236,Garp23,A waste of the talent of everyone involved,4,29 January 2004,"Consider the career of Adam Sandler. He began on MTV and moved to `Saturday Night Live', where he helped spearhead a commercial revolution on that show with castmates like David Spade and Chris Farley. They were considered dumb humor, but dumb humor was just hitting it's stride, with Beavis and Butthead all over the tv and Jim Carrey and the Farrelly Brothers just beginning their reigns at the box office. Sandler was booted from `SNL' by the network brass, who hated him. He starred in a couple of low budget movies, `Billy Madison' and `Happy Gilmore', that were funnier that most critics will admit and became cult hits. Then came `The Wedding Singer' and Sandler hit the mainstream. That, to me, is when he lost his edge. Crap like `The Waterboy' and `Little Nicky' followed, and the box office dwindled. Paul Thomas Anderson, the auteur behind art-house hits `Boogie Nights' and `Magnolia', wrote a movie called `Punch Drunk Love', in which a typical Sandler doofus character was mined for sadness, and critical acclaim followed. The film flopped, however, doomed by confused frat-boy audiences booing, so Sandler is back being Sandler, alongside Jack Nicholson, in `Anger Management'.Both actors are following the most critical acclaim either have had in years (if ever), Sandler with `Punch Drunk Love', and Nicholson with `About Schmidt', in which he lowered his eyebrows and played his age. `Anger Management' has no such aspirations. It wants to be a big, dumb comedy, and it succeeds on two out of three. It just ain't that funny.Sandler plays quiet, shy Dave Buznik who, through a series of misunderstandings, is branded a menace by a judge (Lynne Thigpen, in her final role before her recent and untimely death) and sentenced to full-time anger management training. His instructor, Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson), moves in with him to expedite the process. Rydell is considered a god by his patients, who, as played by such talented actors as Luis Guzman and John Turturro, never seem to get any better.It goes without saying that Buddy destroys Dave's life, insisting that he's a ticking time bomb from internalizing his anger and forcing him to let it out. Soon Sandler is Sandler, smashing things and punching people. He loses his girlfriend, played by Marisa Tomei, thanks to one of Buddy's schemes. No points for guessing if all of this unconventional therapy will actually make Dave a better man and win back his girl.Scattered throughout are cameos by Bobby Knight and John McEnroe playing themselves, and actors like Heather Graham (as a temptress with some brownie issues), John C. O'Reilly (as a childhood bully turned monk), and Woody Harrelson (as a cross-dressing German male prostitute) pop up in a showy way. Steve Buscemi shows up again, as he seems to in all of Sandler's work. Sandler and Nicholson give us what they think we want, playing loud and obnoxious, Nicholson's eyebrows arched over some crazy facial hair.But the script panders too far, avoiding anything new and giving us the obligatory sappy ending. You walk out just thinking that you expected more, and you're right. There is comedy to be mined here, but no one involved is doing anything more than just coasting along on a trail of easy punch lines and predictable slapstick. There is nothing wrong with dumb or gross-out humor; `American Pie', `There's Something About Mary', and the `Austin Powers' movies are just a few examples of flicks with creative, energetic low-brow jokes that work. But `Anger Management' has no creativity and no energy; it's a one-note joke that never seems to end.",Anger Management

Who is so smart and nice n stuff.During the biggest crisis of US-Foreign Policy, this movie just needs to show a little bit of attention to its contributors.And although I really love Adam Sandler as an actor, I really cannot agree with his Pro-War attitude.But, so I go and watch ""my"" kinda Anti-War Propaganda ""Bowling for Columbine"" again.I just hope this great country finally excepts this view, and starts to abolish actions that remind me too much of germany in the 1930`s.Cheers,Boris",Anger Management

Even the idea behind it was workable.  Let's put it this way - viewing this movie with fans of Jack Nicholson, Adam Sandler, Marisa Tomei, etc., we kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen or make sense to no avail.  Instead we tried to figure out how this movie got made - huge amounts of alcohol, cocaine, shrooms on the table while everyone came up with ideas that seemed more hilarious as mass quantities were consumed?

It entertained me for the 2 hours or so.. Jack Nicholson carried the movie to a large extent.. His facial expressions while forcing Sandler's character to sing ""I Feel Pretty"" cracked me up..
Like almost all Sandler movies, this one ends with an insanely cheesy and contrived ending where a crowd cheers for him. Has anyone else noticed this trend? Billy Madison..auditorium cheering.. Waterboy.. stadium cheering.. Wedding singer.. Airplane full of people cheering, etc..

I saw this film yesterday and I quite liked it, which is mostly due to the lovely trio of main actors (namely sandler, nicholson and the gorgeous marisa tomei) AND the unforgettable cameo appearance by woody harrelson rather than the story. some of the therapeutic techniques are ironized quite cleverly (i say this as a student of psychology), nicholson relishes in his comic buddy rydell, sandler (who was great in ""punch drunk love"") succeeds yet again as a pitiable underdog who is being pushed around.

243,kane4782,definitely not classic adam sandler,3,7 July 2003,"I hadnt read much about this film, so I went to the cinema blindly. I sat through the first half hour, thinking what is the point of this film, by the end of it I was thinking, there is no point to this film. It is a brainless piece of film making, which managed to include as many cameos as possible, through Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandlers many contacts.
Of course any Sandler films will have its fair share of laughs, and this was no exceptions, regardless of how bad the actual movie is. Classic moments, include the 'I feel pretty' song, the 'huge dick' jokes and of course Sandlers usual one liner 'You can do it!', which was all the more funnier said by ex NY mayor Giuliani.Anyway, probably one of the worst Sandler films, which is a shame. His recent efforts have been very poor, like Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds and Punch Drunk Love (which didnt make much sense either, even if people did say it was really good.).If you are a real Sandler fan, then you might as well go and see it, if not wait till its available to rent for a night in.",Anger Management

246,CoolDan,"One of Adam Sandler's best, and one of my new comedy favorites!",9,21 April 2003,"This movie is a bit of a gamble for Adam Sandler. This movie really is unlike anything he's done before, because the film doesn't rest entirely on his shoulders. This film rests on the shoulders of Jack Nicholson, how well Sandler and Nicholson play off each other, the script, the impressive array of cameos (including Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, and a surprise appearance by a New York legend), and how well the movie is made overall. Sandler doesn't have too much responsibility here, because the essential goal of his performance is to NOT play the goofy main role he's played so many times before, like in Billy Madison, but to play a weak victim of society, like in Punch Drunk Love. The fact that Sandler has a reduced role is the aspect of the movie may turn some people off, but from my point of view, everything about the movie worked perfectly. This is a twisted, rollicking rollercoaster ride of a black comedy with plenty of laughs along the way. Jack Nicholson gives a brilliant comedic performance of restrained insanity as Dave Buznik's anger management therapist, who is wrongly assigned to crack down on Dave's nonexistent anger problem, and Adam Sandler enjoys his view from the highest point of his career that he hit with Punch Drunk Love, a truly brilliant character drama by Paul Thomas Anderson (although he did slide a bit with the awful Eight Crazy Nights, but it pleased me that even he didn't approve of some of the humor). Again, Sandler has to play the same character he did in Punch Drunk Love, a wimp who is loathed by society and who becomes braver and braver throughout the film as he fights against it, but he has to make his performance funny. I don't know how he does it, but he gives off just as effective a performance he gave in Punch Drunk Love but adds subtle humor to it that pays off and really helps carry the film. There are plenty of near-classic hilarious scenes in the movie that I don't want to spoil. And, again, the supporting cast in this movie is superb, and they all make the movie even funnier. I will close this review with a bold statement: If you ever liked any Adam Sandler movie in any way to any degree, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW, and I guarantee you will laugh. Hell, even if you hate Adam Sandler or you've never seen any of his movies, see this movie anyway! Sandler is on a roll, and this movie proves it!I give this movie 9/10. Excellent comedy!

The impressed girl screams her agreement back, another happy family has been founded. Luckily the movie takes this scene back also, not only the really funny jokes made before. How? Watch the movie and scream at the ending about its stupidity. Maybe the last part was not intended to be stupid, but was only censored, this is my impression anyway.

Truth is that the first hour and ten minutes is some of the best pairing ever in a comedy movie, Nicholson is very much as good as he has ever been playing the character of anger manager and potential Adam Sandler savoir, who has injected himself thoroughly into the young man's life, on a court order to manage Sandler's seemingly accidental violent sprees on Aeroplanes and coffee shops, Nicholson has the full blown mania, spars with Sadler very well, with some extremely memorable scenes, almost four star / five star entertainment, until the final thirty minutes that does the smooch, smaltz, literally stop the baseball show with the I love you ending on the big stadium screen we have seen a million times before, and then another extra smaltz ending one on top of that for good measure, means that this has to be one of the cheesiest movies of all time where the ending(s) actually ruin a great hour of a completely different film.

So here are the pluses and minuses of 'Anger Management'.+ First of all, this film is not a typical comedy. Nowadays I can hardly find a nice and quite realistic comedy with an interesting unpredictable plot and great cast. So that is why I appreciate those rare movies without hot chicks and romantic silly jokes. Like I have just said, actors are behind hilarious (and yes, I can say the same about Adam Sandler!). He plays an ordinary guy David, who has a marvelous girlfriend, a bad boss and his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend, who is her best friend and has a huge penis (well, this part is banal, I can say). However, Sandler fits his role pretty well. I cannot say the same about Nicholson... Because he does it PERFECTLY! I have to admit I love Jack making comedies. He is so expressive!I am sorry, but the scene on the plane makes me very mad! I am sure I am not a psycho, because, hey, who would not get nervous if a person laughed too loudly when you tried to sleep? Or let me remind you of the first David's visit to Buddy's group. I would really get nervous if someone asked me who I was and did not explain what kind of answer he wanted.

I have always been a fan of Jack Nicholson and in Anger Management I thought he was the best performer but unfortunately in this movie that is not saying much. Anger Management is more about the cheap laughs than the substance and novelty characters, an example of novelty characters would be the lesbian porn star couple, obviously included just because they are lesbians and just because they are porn stars. The movie is enjoyable at the beginning and in the middle, with the best scenes being Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson's scenes together. However, the end section especially the scene in the baseball stadium is excruciatingly cheesy, i could barely sit and watch it, it made me feel embarrassed just watching.

And really is that such a bad thing? Most of his movies revolve around a main character (Sandler) who's generally a good guy surrounded by situations that consistently attempt test his character. Sandler, who rose to fame through Saturday Night Live has this type of story down pat and he will continue to use it until it no longer works. (See :$$$)I think that this movie is one of his better versions mostly because of the cast that he has surrounded himself with. Jack's character is great, even though it seems that his methods of treatment are questionable. (The singing scene on the bridge is a riot!) Marisa Tomei, is about as likable as ever. John Turturro's character had me laughing from his first scene and Luis Guzman had me laughing out loud as well. I also enjoyed the cameos by Woody Harrelson, Mayor Guilani, Heather Graham, and John C. Reilly.Another recurring quality about Adam Sandler's movies is that you keep seeing the same familiar faces from previous ones, so I kind of look forward to spotting the people I have seen in his movies before.People like Allen Covert and Jonathan Loughran.Adam Sandler's strategy so far has worked perfectly, and made him very rich in the process. His production company has promoted the same types of movies for almost a decade. He has produced films with the same formula that starred other Saturday Night Live alums as well. (Question: I wonder how Chris Farley's career would have been had he lived? Would he have been in Sandler's position or Schneider's or Spade's?) David Spade, Rob Schneider, Dana Carvey all have used Adam's movie making formula to modest box office success.People who criticize that both Sandler and this formulaic, cookie cutter movie is the very problem with Hollywood; tend to forget that this is what Hollywood is all about. Its core philosophy is to discover what the audience likes and give it to them repeatedly until they no longer like it anymore. That very idea is what drives a studios profit.To Adam's credit, at least he's not hitched to a typecast role; we could have been watching Happy Gilmore 4, for Pete's sake... Instead, he has found a way to play the same type of characters with subtle different characteristics. Tried and true, Adam Sandler provides 2 hours of fun; it may not be original, but it's defiantly entertaining. It's no different than maybe watching an old episode of I Love Lucy, you know the general story - but it still remains fun to watch Adam work it all out",Anger Management
274,dprincesspotter,Funny comedy,9,21 January 2005,"This is a funny movie. When my husband and I went to see it in the theater we were actually laughing out loud. And it was not just us, it was everybody in the theater. Someone looking for a deep and meaningful plot will not find what they are looking for, however it is one of the best plots of all the Adam Sandler movies. It would also not be for anyone who would easily get offended by off-color jokes. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as the Anger Management therapist. He has some of the funniest parts in the whole movie. Adam Sandler is not to shabby himself as the not angry guy learning to be angry through a series of seemingly unfortunate and random events.

You have to blame the producers for letting it get released in this condition.

281,dpharrington,the usual Sandler imbecile,2,15 June 2011,"The only real question about Sandler is how he gets real actors like Buscemi and Turturro, and now Tomei and Nicholson, into his horrid pictures.This one isn't as revolting as this monkey's nauseating remake of Mr Deeds Goes to Town, and he doesn't play the malicious retard of Billy Madison, etc. This is probably the best that can be said about it. By anyone with reasonable taste, anyhow.There isn't a single real laugh anywhere in it, but that rather goes without saying; it's a Sandler movie.Well, there is actually a second real Sandler question: When they could have Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, WC Fields, Bob Hope, even Jerry Lewis for crissake, how can anyone spend twelve seconds with this guy without a fervent desire to push him off a high bridge?",Anger Management

The trailer was okay too. So, my wife, I and our two daughters all expected some kind of a family comedy. But it turned out to be a sick-humored, vulgar and completely obscene thing. Even Sandler, who is a very good actor couldn't save this fiasco. In 30 minutes we all voted to turn it off and, fortunately, had another rental - ""The recruit"" which happened to be a good solid spy movie.So, if you care about comedies to be comedies and not turn into a sick and animal-level entertainment - stay away from the ""Anger Management"".

I rented this hoping for a funny if not irrelevant flick. What I got was a painful experience I will never forget.My biggest complaint about this movie is the fact that each event/scene is so predicable you know what is going to happen long before it plays out. If you fast forward you get to confirm what you expected and get to save the agony of bad writing, bad acting and bad situations.The other big complaint is the really bad ending. I mean really bad. I mean the average 5th grader can write a better story.The was the first movie I have ever seen that I literally could not make it all the way through the first time.

Within the first thirty minutes, I observed twelve people walk out of the theater; I managed to hold out for almost an hour.As expected, the movie contained all of the obligatory direct and indirect references to every conceivable bodily function, both scatological and sexual.  Perhaps I am being overly harsh (and maybe even stodgy), but I'm definitely past the point in my life where I crack up at overly-repetitive ""pee-pee"" and ""pooh-pooh"" humor.  Lest it be thought that I can't enjoy ANY movie in this genre, I should state that I did like ""Something About Mary."" I guess it's a matter of degree.As the movie progressed, I kept imagining the scene where actors were reviewing this lame script for the first time and could not help but wonder, ""What were they thinking?""  Could anyone seeing this dialog on paper possibly think it was funny?  There were precious few scenes that worked - and most of them were in the trailer.My advice: Watch the trailer.

What that thing is: he still acts like a raging idiot and thus, I disliked the movie. Really, if you want an intelligent film, I recommend you don't see this movie.

After all Dave goes through in his anger management sessions it seams he is going to loose the love of his life to a man he thought was a friend, so he decides to fight for the woman he loves, with surprising revelations.There is an excellent support cast as well which includes Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzmán, Kurt Fuller, January Jones and Jonathan Loughran who make the movie even more enjoyable.This film has some great comedy moments, action moments, romantic moments and there is also some just plain strange goings on in this superb comedy.",Anger Management

Watch this film!,8,19 October 2005,"When I first saw this film and as ""David Buznik"" managed to get into more and more trouble while being ""railroaded' all the time my thoughts were what in the world is going on to this poor slob who basically has done nothing to have the wrath of the court brought down upon him while being represented by a lawyer that must have graduated 301 out of a class of 300. Yes, that bad.Adam Sandler once again proves his versatility as an actor. It's hard to pick a favorite movie of his because they're all so good. 50 First Dates is an excellent example of his comedy talents while Punch Drunk Love shows more of his acting ability mixing comedy with drama.Jack Nicholson delivers exactly what you expect, excellence as always. The role fits him perfectly playing what he does so well - a nut! He never ceases to amaze me with his talents be it a love story such as Something's Gotta Give. I was surprised (shouldn't have been) by how he could play such a tender part.The movie itself is a laugh from one end to the other. I especially liked his confrontation with his old school pal Arnie now a Monk. I loved when Dr. Rydell puts in his 2 cents about Buda and Arnie's sister. ""Like a wildebeest"" he says commenting how how Arnie's sister (the ""nut case"")moaned when Dave ""got it on with her"".And who didn't love the fudge attack by Kendra at the beach house? If you haven't seen this movie it's a must see if you love a great comedy. Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson deliver a outrageously funny performance and should work again together. Somewhere there is script with their name on it.So take about 110 minutes out of your life and sit back and be prepared to have a great time.NOTE: Someone's summary for the film was ""Disappointing and Sophomoric"". Not sure what movie they were watching but if they didn't get ANY fun out of this film they should be pronounced legally brain dead"".

I was not sure if he could pull off a comedy performance but i was proved wrong. In this movie he is fantastic as an anger management therapist, and again proves how versatile he is as an actor. Right from his opening scene to the closing credits he steals each scene he is in. I am not a huge fan of Adam sandler but he gives a good performance in this as the ""Victim"" to Nicholson's character of Dr Buddy Rydell. There is also a brilliant supporting cast which includes the under-rated Woody Harrelson as a drag prostitute!! This movie will entertain you, and i can guarantee you'll laugh at many of the scenes.

But Anger Management doesn't even become acceptable viewing in that circumstance.Even for Hollywood-style predictable story-lines, this one had not one iota of credibility (I just love those sport stadium scenes where one person out in the middle can, without a microphone, manage to be heard by everyone in the crowd -- not!).One of the better scenes is where Sandler visits a nemesis of his childhood who has turned spiritual -- this scene was very amusing.

He goes well over the top, and there are many new Jack mannerisms that would not fly too well in a serious drama.  As for Sandler, its the same thing from his other flicks, but thats what I pay to see anyways.  If I wanted a different comedy then I wouldn't go see Adam Sandler.Plus, the cameos are enough to make anyone laugh.

So good in fact that I'm a little uneasy about writing this review, because my dear readers (and I know you're out there.....aren't you?) I wanted to come back with high-praise and cheers......not disappointment.  But it has to be done.
Anger Management is this spring movie season's most anticipated release, due mostly because of the unusual (yet genius) pairing of Adam Sandler and Jack ""Here's Johnny!"" Nicholson.  Sandler plays Dave Buznik:  a very self-deprecating semi-loser (like always); who hates his boss, loves his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei of My Cousin Vinny fame), and constantly suppresses his outrage and anger when confronted.  We learn early on the story behind his timidness is a result of an embarrassing run-in with a bully back in his fifth-grade days.  After a somewhat hilarious predicament on an airplane, a judge orders Buznik to ""manage"" his anger (ooh, nice wordage there) with the help of anger guru Buddy Rydell- played illustriously by our friend Jack. Buznik then finds his whole personal and private life radically altered when Buddy moves in and takes over; which in turn causes Buznik to face and control his anger demons.Now let me say that I had high expectations for this movie, due to the sheer fact of seeing both Nicholson and Sandler in the same movie.  Not as high as say DeNiro and Pacino (and I'm referring to the epic Heat), but close enough.  However, and unfortunately, the script isn't that well written. The plot seems a bit empty and too much like previous crappy Sandler vehicles like Mr. Deeds and  Little Nicky.  Don't get me wrong, I was laughing at certain scenes (Nicholson and Sandler share a bed together...hilarious) and the chemistry between the stars was very good. Also the kooky side characters, that Sandler loves to embed in his movies, bring the movie up a couple notches (John Turturro and Luis Guzman are downright hilarious).  And don't forget the endless cameos the likes of everybody from Woody Harrelson to everyman John C. McGinley to Heather Graham to Rudy Guilianni.  But without these actors and cameos (and of course without JACK) the movie as a whole is a bit disappointing.Overall, not too bad, but may be a bit over-hyped like everything else these days.  I give this movie a 3.4 out of 5.0.  It'll probably play better on video.",Anger Management
307,carellot,hard to believe the rating,1,13 November 2006,"Well, I've just seen this movie and I saw it all! I have to admit it was tough to make it, because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I only expected an entertaining movie, with no plot, just for some amusement, but I only got a brainless dull movie. I've usually enjoyed other Sandler's movies, but this one is really hard to swallow. My opinion is that most of the 'humor' in this movie is only mere 'bad taste' and although it has a lot of great actors, I think nobody's right part of the brain got tired while making this film.Just one last comment ( a little spoiler ): my English is poor, but I guess I understood this 'joke' right: does people find it funny when Nicholson says that in Europe it's not unusual for men to sleep in the same bed with 2 or 3 men? The answer he gets is: 'that's why i'm proud to be an American'... ho, ho, ho... no further comment.",Anger Management

It was easy to figure out, and I almost fast forwarded at the end just to get it over with, but I watched any way, already knowing what was going to happen. If you enjoy watching the over inflated ego of Jack Nicholson, then perhaps you will like this movie. I for one prefer his classics such as Witches of Eastwick or the Shining. Heck, even the Bucket List was at least a feel good movie. This felt like an hour and half Saturday Night Live Skit to me.Anyways, just my opinion.",Anger Management

313,SuperDJB,"""Funny Movie, But Like Most Sandler Movies, Targeted Mostly For Teens, But Adults May Enjoy This One.""",7,4 May 2003,"WARNING: SPOILERS COULD BE MENTIONED!!!!I actually saw this movie kind of late, because I read mostly bad reviews for this movie. I saw this movie, and I actually found it a good movie, I actually liked this movie. Well, to say I am a teenager critic, I understand the fact why I probably found this movie very funny. I have to admit the plot of ""Anger Management"" wasn't well organized, but a plot doesn't need to be well written in a comedy, it just needs to be funny. Adam Sandler was really funny in this movie, but the funniest character was Jack Nicholoson. The plot was about a man named Dave Buznik, he works at a pet designer company, in the movie he is a very calm man (very ironic to the movie itself) he doesn't stand up to himself or anything. In the beginning he gets on a plane and gets into an arguement with a flight attendant(Because she claims that he is angry when he is practically whispering), then he eventually does get angry, he gets sent to Anger Management class where the teacher is Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). As the movie goes on, these 2 become a comedy duo, at Dave has indifference about Buddy, then it goes to thinking Buddy is insane when Buddy moves in with Dave trying to get rid of his anger (Buddy is pretty nutty, but hey his techniques do have some effect on rage), then Dave thinks that Buddy is an OK guy after beating the crap out of his childhood enemy, Shankman (John C. Reily) who is a Buddhist Monk. Then it turns to hatred when Buddy starts to date his girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei). Then it turns to friendship when the ending which I prefer not to mention happens. Those who saw this movie, you know what happens.""Anger Management"" had many extremely funny parts, there was a lot of profanity in there though talking about one guy named Andrew (Allen Covert) who Dave is jealous of because he has a big yin-yan. Andrew wants to date Linda. Some of the really funny parts included the part where Buddy forced Dave to be late for work when he wanted him to sing a song from ""West Side Story"" saying ""I feel so pretty, I feel so witty, I feel very gay."" It was funny seeing them sing that song and the bypassers screaming curses at them. Another funny, yet minor character was Chuck (John Tutorro). He was a guy with a lot of rage!! In the beginning Buddy assigned Chuck as an anger ally, until Chuck and Dave got into a fight and Dave accidentally hurt a cocktail waiter, of course starting the heck with Buddy moving in with Dave. The ending is an intersting ending which I will not mention. But it has a happy ending for most.Rating: 7.5/10",Anger Management

Well, I would have to say that this god forsaken piece of sh*t ruined my whole day. I simply cannot understand this movie's target group - it cannot be addressed neither to adults nor children because the former are hopefully too intelligent and the latter too innocent for such idiocy.Due to my enormous respect for Nicholson as an actor I forced myself to sit quietly until the end; otherwise I would have just got up and walked the hell out of the cinema. I am extremely disappointed in him - how? How the heck could he willingly take part of such nonsense? Adam Sandler proved once again that he is and stays an actor who cannot play anyone except morons.I kept looking at my watch all the time - the film was absolutely excruciating. I admit, there were some scarce moments when a part of my mouth moved upwards but `hilarious' is further than the sun from the word I would describe this movie.I do not want to sound negative or anything like that but, GOD, I cannot help myself, this movie was even tackier, lamer, and cornier than I ever expected a Hollywood-Cr*p-Industry product to be.",Anger Management

Jack Nicholson does a lot of great Jack Nicholson-y things all through this lumbering gag fest, but even Jack's deranged good guy/bad guy antics aren't enough to save Anger Management from its too clever, too precious self. If there weren't, oh, 10,000 close ups of Adam Sandler's screwy face, it might have been more bearable. He has a distractingly ugly mouth that is better suited to wide, very wide shots. Whatever rhythm and flow that the film manages to develop is quickly disrupted by corny bits, hackneyed gags, and over the top, self serving in-jokes and cameos such as Mayor Giuliani cheering for Adam to kiss Marisa Tomei in front of a packed Yankees Stadium. It's a major buzz kill moment. The point of the whole contrived story still eludes me - are we supposed to channel all our anger into winning a bride? Interesting, crazy, dumb idea.",Anger Management
317,whoawap,A watered-down version of Sandler's comedies,3,21 December 2005,"Anger management, much as I expected, was funny in many scenes but did not have a decent plot like Happy Gilmore and a few other better movies of Adam Sandler. Honestly even though Jack Nicolson's acting seemed decent, I find his character (Buddy) to be annoying at multiple times. In the movie, Dave (played by Sandler) was manipulated in numerous occasions by his eccentric teacher. I felt bad for him many times, especially when Buddy hooked up with Dave's girlfriend Linda and left him alone with the bar girl. He also stopped Dave from driving in the middle of the highway, smashed the breakfast Dave made for him and even broke the car of another person. Comedy like this is not my style, even though a few moments of it were hilarious. The scene that was extremely funny was when Chuck attacked the bald man and when Dave tried to stop them, the blind man hits him with a cane. That and a few other scenes were the ones I liked.Frankly, I felt extremely disturbed at the Buddhist Monk scene where Sandler kicks his former rival's *** to take revenge by being bullied. Even though the guy may deserved it, his status was now a monk. Let me tell you this, I am a Buddhist myself and I am an Asian. To find a scene where someone assaulting a religious disciple really is offensive and profane. In regards to that, Dr. Buddy (played by Jack Nicolson) makes some abusive jokes about Buddha being fat and several other caustic remarks. Could someone please kick the movie director or the scriptwriter's *** because comedies should not be insulting towards other people's religions.In my opinion, Buddy needs a hell of a beating from Dave, of all the things he had done. Adam Sandler's comedy in Anger Management does not seem very funny at all when you find out the real truth in the end. I am not going to reveal what the ending is but for many who watched the movie, they are not really satisfied either. From my perspective, I recommend Happy Gilmore instead of this. Comedy fans should watch a much, much higher valued movie like Meet the Parents because it is funny overall and has a very good plot and plus it is very touching. Normally, I do not rank movies that low and I am a person who tends to appreciate things quite easily, honestly. Anger Management however, does contain inappropriate joke scenes and thus, that is why I rank it with 3 stars out of 10.",Anger Management

339,wilsonc1991,Movie was an accurate snapshot of America,8,18 May 2010,"This movie demonstrates an accurate cross section of American society. Most of the people interacting with Dave, the main character, know Buddy, the anger management counselor, implying that they are, or were, angry at a point in time. This is accurate because it demonstrates how most people are angry, whether conscious or not. This unconscious anger is exhibited in Dave, where his anger stems from childhood, but he covers it up with his lack of self-respect and unwillingness to stand up for himself. This movie also represents how people can get rid of their anger by being able to let themselves get angry, but when they feel anger, let it go, and practice becoming able to release the anger instead of letting it pin up inside. This technique is shown throughout the movie and eventually resolves itself in the end, as with becoming able to control and release the ""anger sharks""",Anger Management
340,manchesterunitedboy9,American Society vs Anger Management,10,18 May 2010,"The movie Anger Management is a great and funny movie, but it does not accurately reflect the state of anger in American Society. The anger that exists nowadays in America has different actions that don't reel in laughs but violence and crimes. People that have bad anger in America don't have anger therapists like Dr. Buddy Rydell that completely change someone's life and even lives with them for therapy . American people are volatile like the characters of Dave Buznik , Nate, Lou, and Chuck, but they aren't nice like they are. Their anger leads to people getting killed and harmed, domestic violence and so forth , not to proposals , and nice songs on the freeway. Anger results from many things. It accumulates over time like in the case of Dave Buznik. Anger like this does happen in American society , but it is usually from something recent accumulate in probably in the past 5 years at most, not something accumulated since their childhood. People with anger tend to focus on recent anger rather that on anger accumulated over 20 years. Anger management does not have such great effects in American society. Many people in American society have to repeat anger management several times, and even after that they commit crimes. In American Society , people don't have nice wives like Linda that supports Dave, rather than that , loneliness strongly affects the people who suffer from anger in American Society. Also, many people that have anger tend to have antisocial behavior that is very violent. American society is much more violent that Dave. The only character that comes close to representing the things that American society does when in anger is Chuck who is very aggressive. That seems to be realistic, well only his behavior, not his psychotic way of thinking or talking(people like him are usually in an asylum). The one part of suppressing anger was correct from the movie. American society tends to be too busy and also have lots of pride so anger is suppressed a lot in American society. Yet, how many people allow their therapists to sleep naked, break CD's, and fart in the bed. If someone truly needed anger management , they wouldn't allow their therapists to do that , the therapists would get hurt in the first time, rather than later on after multiple acts like Dave finally did after Buddy said that he was going to start dating Linda. Anger is also not completely changed in someone's life just after two weeks like in the movie. If people have been accumulating anger after a long time, they are not going to completely change itThe movie Anger Management is mostly fictional when portraying the anger that exits in American Society. There may be a few instances when the movie might portray something accurate, but overall is just a funny comedy that makes up funny scenarios of things that lead to severe consequences in real life. It gives a funny side which may be misleading to people of how its just fun and games to be in anger managemnt. It should've given the dark and true sides of anger. Anger in American Society is a major problem , yet it is a method of derision to people with actual anger problems.",Anger Management
341,jillian-hernandez3,anger in American society,8,18 May 2010,The state of anger in American society is accurately reflected in the movie anger management. There are people in America who have to take anger management classes in order to try and fix their problems that I'm sure others can relate to.The main actor in the movie Adam Sandler has issues when he grows up because of the things that happened to him when he was younger. Anger comes from depression and anxiety. Adam is angry about the kid that bullied him when he was younger and embarrassed him in front of everyone. The humiliation caused him to become angry or self conscious when certain things happen.Anger can come from several different things but depression and anxiety are the main ones. In the movie i think it showed many different points of how anger can effect your life and how you can help it.Basically anger is a well known feeling that everyone has experienced at one point but if you let it get out of hand then you need to get help. If you try and take anger management classes it could help you in the long run and this movie showed how its possible to over come phobias and what not.,Anger Management

He is wrongfully accused in court and sentenced to anger management where he meets Buddy.Buddy helps Dave respond to anxiety issues in the beginning. We can see that Dave is always fidgeting around, clenching his fists, and tapping his feet. Throughout the movie we see how he battles with tension, depression, ""toxic anger syndrome"", and his phobia of PDA.Buddy uses tactics where Dave must confront his problems head on. Dave confronts his childhood bully and whoops his butt. Then he is forced to meet hot women in bars, confront his insane boss, and ultimately show his girlfriend how much he loves her in front of a large crowd.

345,elmerace,Does the movie Anger Management accurately reflect the state of anger in American society?,8,18 May 2010,"I believe that the movie does accurately reflect the state of anger in American society. But i also believe that that although it shows the angry aspect of of our American society. It does a bad job of showing the way the setting affects our different emotions.The movie is set in new york which, to me, is the angriest town in America. Because of how congested it is and how everybody is trying to do their own thing; work, drive to work, sell stuff. in the movie the streets were always crowded and the streets were all congested. the people in the background didn't seem like the type that would be friendly to you. when i think of new york i think of traffic jams, muggers, bad weather, and angry people.Also to me, if the movie was set in a more calm setting it would be a lot different. For example; to me, Texas is a friendly state that if the movie was set here it there would be a lot of changes. in Texas, the weather is weird bit not extreme like in new york. There are days when it feels really good outside and people go enjoy the weather and do outdoor activities. Unlike New york. When you walk down the street, you don't see hundreds of people and hundreds of cars all congested. you see friendly people and more importantly, space. in new york you actually need an elevator to park your car while in Texas we have our own space. I noticed that everybody down here is in a neutral happy mood where unlike in New York; everybody is confrontational. I believe it is all about how the person was brought up and where he was brought up.So in conclusion it all depends where and how you were brought up. it is your setting and your experiences that affect you in your life. if you live in a dangerous, congested high crime rate area then there is a higher possibility that you will grow up to be an angry, disturbed person. While if you grow up in a small, close, community then you might be less angry than the other guy. so to me, i believe it depends on external factors.",Anger Management
346,daviditty,Does the movie accurately reflect the state of anger in American Society?,1,18 May 2010,"Anger is a major problem that people in American society struggle with. Some people even have to take management courses, to try and settle their problems. Just like it was shown in the movie anger management. I will now state examples of anger from the movie, and relate it with society. Anger is usually caused from different sources, like depression or anxiety. For instance, in the movie Adam Sandler gets his anger from other people forcing him to act in such ways which causes anxiety. Like in the airplane scene, the flight attendant pushes his buttons along with the air marshall by telling him to calm down when he was calm the whole time. Also another example of a cause is when Adam Sandler's character starts to become depressed because of Buddy Ridel taking his girlfriend when he should have helped him. That caused him to lose control and go to his work place and take control and tell his boss what was really on his mind. These examples prove that anger can be caused easily by many sources, which is why it is a major problem in society today. This movie portrays anger and its courses you can take in a funny way. It also shows how anger is caused most of the time, and how to react to it",Anger Management

Jack Nicholson's acting was off I think because Adam is hard to work around.  He's a very boring actor that doesn't help the character have a personality at all.... drib drab character.  Marisa was disappointing too.. if you liked her in My Cousin Vinny... you'll hate her role here... Don't waste your money... wait till it's out in video...then waste it...",Anger Management
352,proshopper,Can't believe I walked out on a Nicholson movie!!,2,16 April 2003,"I've been a Jack Nicholson fan for a LONG time (even knew someone who acted as an extra in ""Cuckoo's nest"".) But I've got to tell you, I'd rather see the man bow out of the business gracefully than lower himself to making ""schlock"" like this. This movie was not only NOT funny, but an embarrasment to an actor of Nicholsons' caliber. I expected this from Sandler, but not from him. The plot was not only implausible, but made me squirm in MY seat from embarrasment for all involved in the film. Don't waste your money..not even when it comes out on video!!!",Anger Management
353,blueluck,Disappointed,5,16 April 2003,"I was quite disappointed by Anger Management.  Nicholson was great as usual and Sandler wasn't bad, but only about half of the jokes were funny. Granted, some of them were very funny!  I feel that Adam Sandler was a poor choice to play the lead.--- Partial Spoiler Starts Here ---What disappointed me the most was I felt like every other scene didn't happen.  I have no problem with fooling the audience along with the protagonist, but it gets old after the first three times in a film!  By about the half-way point I found myself assuming that every scene was just a trick one character was playing on another, and I was right!",Anger Management
354,jbpierpont,A complete waste of time! Terrible movie!!!,1,19 April 2003,"I feel cheated. Big names - no bang. Nicholson and Sandler really sold out their fans with this one. I walked out of this movie and I have not walked out on a movie since 1976, when I was 6 years old. We laughed more during the previews than we did during the movie. POOR, POOR, POOR Movie. Strongly recommend skipping this one, even on DVD or video. Shame on the studio for putting this one into production. Someone should be fired for letting this one out.",Anger Management
355,digidatstream,Huge Disappointment,3,20 April 2003,"All I have to say is that I expected way more from Jack and Adam.  Way too many corny scenes (singing on a bridge in New York?...).  It had a few highlights (Heather Grahams chocolate scene, and monk combat...), but overall, wait until it comes out on DVD.",Anger Management
356,hollywood_sux,Enough is enough!,1,20 April 2003,"Enough is enough!   Last Saturday evening I watched one of the worst movies I have ever seen -- Anger Management.I was aghast -- this movie was one 2-hour long penis joke -- with other forms of crude bathroom humor thrown in.  I'm no puritan by any means -- but some of the jokes in the movie seventh-grade boys would find offensive.I anticipated the release of this movie for 2 months -- and it didn't deliver.  Jack Nicholson -- Adam Sandler -- in a way I should have known better -- but movie review sites gave it  4 1/2 stars (out of five).  Are you kidding me?!  Schindler's List barely got 4 1/2 stars -- I was clearly misled.The movie had so much potential -- the need in our society to learn how to process repressed anger -- truly a worthy topic.  But this movie's pedestrian treatement of the subject matter, apart from being inane, would probably result in one only becoming more angry and finally going beserk.I'm asking the theatre for a refund.",Anger Management
357,gonzalez1960,Worse movie I've ever seen,1,20 April 2003,"I had never walked out on a movie before, until now.  It is absolutely the worse movie I've ever seen.  Part of the problem was the rating.  It should have been rated R, not PG-13.  Since I do not go to R rated movies (because of the sexual content and the language) I was not expecting to find that sort of material running rampant at a supposedly PG-13 movie.  People who liked this movie are probably those who also go to R-rated movies, not people like me looking for something funny and at least partially clean!",Anger Management
358,kean2000,A good comedy,7,27 April 2003,"I think this film is one of Sandlers best. He shows that he has different aspect to his acting as he did i Punch Drunk Love. The film is all about a man trying do deal with his dull life, and his childhood trauma although that doesn't sound like a comedy IT IS. Jack Nicholson is as always wonderful. I highly recommend to all fans of Sandler/Nicholson.",Anger Management
359,jadrose2,I laughed...until the plot made my head explode,4,22 April 2003,"This film is funny, but Jack Nicholson is the only funny part of it. Adam Sandler tried a different type of character in this movie and it just didn't work.  The most disappointing part was the lack of a Steve Buscemi cameo. I have to admit Woody Harrelson made my ribs hurt.",Anger Management
360,bblue22,good but could've been better.,9,25 April 2003,Anger Management was a funny movie Jack and Adam were funny in the same movie but the ending made it worse.  It was a little cheese but besides that I thought it was great and its a must see.  I am a big fan of Adams movies and this might have to be my favorite better than Happy Gilmore.,Anger Management
361,bjf1-1,What a disappointment!,1,3 May 2003,"There was no plot to Anger Management. What a disappointment from what we were expecting from the excellent cast of this movie! Not only was the story line weak and redundant, but the rating of PG-13 must have just met the cut below R. I would not recommend anyone allowing their teenager to see this movie. It had vulgar language, violence, alcoholism, alternate lifestyles(graphically portrayed at points), and a meager performance from the cast. The story itself, which was Jack Nicholson as an anger management counselor, with less than ""ideal"" tactics, whose goal was to help Adam Sandler, was beyond slow.  The story line itself had potential, and with this cast, it should have been pulled off. Instead, the movie went round and round in circles, covering the same material over and over (much like this review). I suggest you save your money.",Anger Management
362,whitesite,Would NOT recommend to a friend.,3,13 May 2003,"Although there were a few funny lines and scenes, I expected much, much more from anything featuring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler.  The plot was impossible despite the ""happy ending"" attempt.  The characters were shallow and unbelievable.  This is only the second movie I'd even considered walking out on, and  actually asked my date if she would like to leave!  My rating of 3 was probably high.",Anger Management
363,cjrl1029,Anything worse?,1,19 May 2003,"Okay, I went to see Anger Management for 2 reasons, and anyone else will agree: 1.) Adam Sandler; 2.) it looked funny. I saw it yesterday and it was awful. I cannot believe how boring that movie was! It was a major disappointment to me, as an Adam fan. Well there is a bright side to this movie: his next movie HAS to be better than this one!",Anger Management
364,smhaywood,You Bet I'm Angry!,1,20 May 2003,"I'm angry because I paid actual hard-earned money to watch part of this movie. This is the first movie that I ever walked out on but walk (no run) I did. A waste of talent and money. At best a potty-mouthed, crude attempt at humor far below the talents of the likes of Jack Nicholson and Marisa Tomei. At worst, an insult to the movie going public. I've read the well meaning reviews on this and other sites attempting to read some sort of cosmic intelligence in to this piece. Don't delude yourselves. You wasted your money to and there's no getting around it.",Anger Management
365,Cine6022,"Sandler must endure Nicholson as a ""professional"" anger management counselor.",1,20 May 2003,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It portrays professionals behaving completely unethically in ways that astonish. Air marshals and licensed psychologists would be brought up on charges if they committed acts such as are depicted in this movie. Sandler is insipid and Jack Nicholson should be put out to pasture. Ugh!,Anger Management
366,blidberg,Great fun! Adam Sandlers best picture ever!,8,2 July 2003,"When Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) was a child he sometimes got teased. But Dave just kept all of his anger inside of him.25 years later he meets a certain Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). Buddy is the crazy psychologist who's going to help Dave through his anger management. Dave will visit the guy who pulled his pants down in front of a great mass when he was young. However by this time this guy lives as a monk but Dave has to follow Buddy's orders or else as has to spend a few years in prison.You have to see this picture, it's the funniest movie I've seen since Dumb & Dumber (1994)! Jack Nicholson is phenomenal as always./Johan Blidberg",Anger Management
367,imdb-2211,One line joke (includes spoiler),1,6 June 2003,"If you haven't seen this film already, and want to watch it, stop reading right now. This does give hints at what is happening. Personally, I would tell you not to waste your money, but it's your cash.It's a truly atrocious film, based on a scenario, which was done much more effectively, and funnier, by The Trueman Show.  This one-joke movie not only sports a really weak plot, it advocates violence as a method of solving problems. Speaking as someone who has had to deal with internalised anger, I can tell you that this film gives really bad advice. (That spoiler is coming right up now.)Dave, a nice but dim person struggling along, while being bossed around by all and sundry, is falsely accused of assaulting a air stewardess, and put into anger management. Enter Dr Rydell, who proceeds to make his life a living hell for the next few weeks. He is put in the position of having to sleep with Dr Rydell (hmm, sleeping with Jack Nicholson.  Nope, mustn't, just got married, remember) embarrass himself in public, associate himself with a bunch of loons in Dr Rydell's anger management class, taunt a Buddhist monk into attacking him, dump his girlfriend, and finally find out that his girlfriend has been stolen by Dr Rydell.  All of which is not true. Yep, it was just a set up to get him so riled that he would do the right thing, and ask her to marry him.The acting was good, I'll admit that. Jack just doesn't seem to be able to put a foot wrong, and Adam Sandler shows remarkable talent at depicting someone who puts up with a lot of stress and doesn't want to be the bad guy. However this can't make up for the lack of plot, the lack of humour, and the fact that this film advocates violence as an effective way of dealing with everyday abuse.  Rather than asserting his right to be associated with his work, Dave destroys furniture with a golf club, and punches out the long-time ex of his girl.  A very adult way of dealing with the problem, I'm sure you all agree.Send the writers to plot management, please, and let's give these talented actors something better to deal with.Oh yes, thanks for the spell-check guys, but humour is spelt with that second 'u'. At least over here where we invented the language it is.",Anger Management
368,tattyhead,"A great idea, terribly done",4,15 September 2003,"Whilst the idea of the insane therapist is a good one with lots of potential, and whilst it's also true that the part of the therapist had Jack Nicholson's name written all over it as I'm sure there wasn't much acting involved for him, this film hit rock bottom.It's corny, predictable, unfunny and a great opportunity wasted.A bit like my time watching it.",Anger Management
369,simfros,TERRIBLE MOVIE,1,24 September 2003,"This was the WORST film i have seen in a very long time. The plot was boring, and the actors weren't fabulous. A lot of people told me it was a good movie to see, but i wasn't willing to spend my money at the cinema to see it. The DVD didn't make it any better.",Anger Management
370,xorcerer,"this is not a bad comedy, it's a GREAT DeProgrammer!",9,31 October 2003,"I have read a lot of negative opinions, but fortunately I didn't take them seriously. I have found in this film exactly what I have expected - a deep look into typical modern man's programs for lifetime.There's nearly everything what's important and on top today - repression of emotions, repression of sexuality, repression of basic drive for power and survival... all in one. And all of these is being revealed right into it's true, fully mad picture by Jack Nicholson, a person whom I reckon the second most deprogrammed actor in the world, after the great Anthony Hopkins.This is a great film, but not for purposes of mindless entertainment, rather for purposes of knowing self. I strongly recommend this film.",Anger Management
371,sharpshooter-1,"One of the worst, only Jack saved the day.",2,3 January 2004,"I rated this movie a 2.  While it had some funny bits and pranks, that is about all it was.  There was no plot to speak of even for a comedy.  I have see movies by The Three Stooges with more plot and funnier pranks. This movie would have been better suited to a half hour TV comedy, where there is only about seventeen minutes of playing time.Only Jack Nicholson's excellent performance made it tolerable.",Anger Management
372,orsini,Stinks except for a few moments,4,3 January 2004,"The worst Nicholson movie I've seen, and a bit scary, because it looks like morons are now in charge of moviemaking. As others commented the idea is decent, the cast is good, but the whole is smaller than each of its parts. The screenwriter wasn't around when they handed out brains or the humor bone. Heavy, stilted situational comedy, other jokes very low on subtlety, 7-th grade bathroom variety. One can predict what will happen 20 minutes in advance. Stay away from this one. I am amazed that someEinstein in Hollywood actually approved and funded this quarter-baked script for filming, when there was so much potential with Nicholson and Tomei on board. The director should go back to his Burger King job as soon as practical. I chuckled quietly at some good lines 3 times total in the two hours. Another $4 in rental fees wasted.",Anger Management
373,MikeOCE,Boring Unfunny,1,19 January 2004,This is one of the most boring and unfunny movies I have ever seen. Switched it off before the end just could not put up with it any more. The blank screen was funnier and more entertaining. Whoever wrote this sad sad story should give up and try another career.,Anger Management
374,Taur,Finally an Adam Sandler movie for the rest of us.,10,21 March 2004,"This is the best Adam Sandler movie I have ever seen.
I am no longer a teenager so I generally avoid Sandler's movies like the plague.  Beside a couple of Penis-envy jokes this movie is actually a joy to watch in mixed company.Well worth your time.If this is some of Jack Nicholson rubbing of on Sandler I look forward to Sandler's next movie.Nicholson is completely over the top with his role.
Rating 8/10  for a comedy. 10/10 for a Sandler comedy.",Anger Management
375,medoza2004,Fight Even With Fight,7,8 August 2004,"This movie is not a masterpiece,not a one of a kind,not a miracle in a look.But few men could make such movies.It's about an ordinary man who doesn't use to fight for his rights and always suffers from it. In a plan formed by his fiancée,a psycho psychologist staring 'Jack Nicholson' makes him dig his way by feeling danger of losing his most precious possession(his fiancée) and getting him green with envy. Through the anger management program, he learns that the best way of getting rid of anger is to raise the stink in every aspect of life. That's full of fun but not only fun.Siavash Rostami",Anger Management
376,fburke1-1,Be careful when bashing this one...,10,20 January 2005,"I was reading all of the worst-movie-of-all-time-postings. The fact that I immensely enjoyed this movie implies that the bashers were likely offended by this movie. The only way to offend someone is to hit one of their soft spots. This means the reason they probably hated this movie is that they need their own Buddy to help root out some of their passive-aggressive habits, but nobody they know cares enough. The angry fights that followed were another indication of this. Why would anyone spread anger around on a message board? Do you want to be remembered as someone who spreads anger or love? The reason I liked it so much is because I am very often too timid and the repressed anger surfaces in other places. I needed this movie to help me take a hard look at myself. In conclusion, the more you hate this movie, the more you probably need it... I love irony!!!",Anger Management
377,wkt1,After assaulting an air hostess Dave Buznik must undergo anger management with the help of DR Buddy Rydell,10,17 January 2015,Anger Management is one of the best movies i have ever seen with an excellent cast and story . I could not stop laughing Jack Nicholsons performance was very funny throughout the whole movie .Fans of both Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler will love this film .There is nothing bad i can say about this movie . The plot is very well thought out with no holes or problems like some of Adam Sandlers other movies . I have seen this movie at least ten times and every time i watch it it gets better . the supporting cast also help to make the movie so brilliant including Woody Harrelson and John Turturro who both have small but great parts in the film .,Anger Management
378,FightingIrish784,One of the funniest movies i have ever seen,9,6 January 2006,"I thought Anger Management was hilarious. The star of the movie is Jack Nicholson. He is unbelievably funny. Although the spotlight is on Adam Sandler, Jack Nickolson is the real star. He makes the movie truly hilarious. Sandler is also good, and though he's most known only for Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Sandler was also hilarious in this movie. He is more laid back, and a lot less goofy than in some of his earlier comedies. While Nickolson steals most of the spotlight as far as funny lines, Sandler is actually the more serious character in this movie. The ""monk scene"" is one of the funniest scenes in a movie that i have ever scene (WILDEBEST!!!) The movie is full of laugh out loud jokes, and is, in my opinion, Adam Sandler's best work yet.",Anger Management
379,EdGreenDay,Probably Not Adam's Greatest,4,12 September 2005,"I wouldn't say that Anger Management is Adam's greatest movie. Some of the jokes are funny, but this movie really is a bummer when you find out that it was all a set-up. What did Jack Nicholson's character just pick a random guy and say ""Oh you need some Anger Management classes"". This movie is chunk sh!t. Honestly, I don't know what all you people see in the movie. The plot is dumb, the ending sucked. I wasn't really into the Buddhist joke, it was dumb. I have a big argument over my Italian-Girl-Fetish friend that this movie is good. I mean can you guys really get it through your skulls, that this movie sucks ass.Well, on a more positive note, some parts were funny, but that doesn't change the fact that this movie blows.",Anger Management
380,spanishwizard,summary of anger management,9,8 October 2005,This is definitely an upbeat film which is of nonstop laughter. Jack Nicholson is known to be a tremendous actor of broad range and various movie directors love the opportunity to cast him in yet one more unique role type. When else has he been cast as a therapist ? And I can tell you from the standpoint of being someone who has been in therapy how refreshing it would be to have a therapist like this one. People used to always look forward to the most recent John Wayne movie even though they almost always seemed the same. It's always refreshing to see Nicholson's recent movie they are never the same. Overall this is a tremendous cast who has come together to produce dynamic entertainment.,Anger Management
381,matt_flemming,Jack at his best!,7,3 April 2020,I know Adam Sandler usually cops a bad rap for most of his performances but people seem to expect too much from him. He and Jack work so well in this and the laughs just keep coming. One of my go to comedies.,Anger Management
