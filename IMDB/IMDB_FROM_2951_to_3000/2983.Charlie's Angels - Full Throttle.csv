0,TheLittleSongbird,Pretty Horrendous!,2,11 May 2009,"The first film was flawed, but that was a lot more enjoyable than this. The script was terrible, and what was worse, the actors couldn't do anything with it. Plus, Bill Murray is a noble absentee, and he was what made the first movie. The stunts, where well executed in the first movie, were rather tedious to put it kindly. The plot was slow, predictable and uninteresting. I don't think any of the film was funny at all. I really admire Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, and they are one of two reasons why I am not giving this a 1. Another was the brief appearance of Demi Moore as the seductive villainess Maddison Lee. All in all, I thought the film was awful, too many wardrobe changes, faults in the script, tedious stunts, and unconvincing villains. All in all, a film that makes the first movie look like a masterpiece, which of course it isn't. 2/10 for the girls and Demi Moore(who deserved much better than this).

1,Leofwine_draca,Every bit as bad as the first,1,21 April 2019,"FULL THROTTLE is the CHARLIE'S ANGELS sequel which is every bit as execrable as the original. The story is pure nonsense, with the trio of high-kicking girls once more up against a mega-villain and her allies; a youthful-looking Demi Moore is one of the star attractions here in a cast littered with random cameos and the like. Despite the presence of Chinese choreographers, the CGI martial arts fights are ridiculously bad, the special effects among the worst I've seen (the car crash in particular) and the attempts at humour quite pitiful. Other than the MC Hammer scene, I can safely say I didn't enjoy a single second of this.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
2,SnoopyStyle,The ridiculous humor wore me out,3,19 May 2014,"The Angels (Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz) rescue US Marshall Ray Carter (Robert Patrick). This sets off the theft of two titanium rings with valuable encrypted info on the Federal Witness Protection Program. Bernie Mac is the new Bosley. Now the Angels have to recover the rings.The girls are taking what was marginally fun and surprising to a ridiculous level. Director McG is pushing it so hard at every second of the movie that I never get a chance to take a breath. If it doesn't tire you out by the end, then you may have had a good time. Chances are that your brain will be hurting long before then. There was a joy in Cameron Diaz shaking her butt in the original. This one feels so much more staged. The joy is lost and the new Bosley is way too silly. The movie is just one comedic setup after another. Most of the time, I can't follow the story anyways. It needs to take some breaks to relax.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Silly Festival of Special Effects, Wasting the Talent of Good Actors",4,14 February 2004,"Two titanium rings, with the identities of the persons under the witness protection program are stolen and some of these persons are threatened or murdered. The Charlie's Angels try to retrieve the rings. This story is so silly that is almost impossible to make any comment. Although having an excellent cast, there is no acting, only special effects. I myself was tired of seeing flying and spinning women. The action in the beginning of the movie looks like a 007 or Indiana Jones film and is fine. The dialog between Matt LeBlanc and John Cleese about the real activity of Alex (Lucy Liu) with the misunderstanding of John Cleese is funny. But the rest is basically only special effects. I was also impressed with Demi Moore, very deformed, maybe due to the quantity of silicone in her body. The excellent  Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro, from the marvelous  `Bicho de Sete Cabeças' and `Abril Despedaçado' (and also from `Carandiru') is completely wasted, without any line. I know how important Hollywood is for the career of an actor, and the worldwide promotion this film may bring to him, but I really felt sorry for his participation. Why having that scene with a cell phone, if he is not supposed to speak any word in the movie? Just as a curiosity for the readers, in Brazil of the 70's, a beautiful and sexy girl was usually called by the slang `pantera' (`panther'). At that time, the TV series `Charlie's Angels' was very popular in Brazil and called `As Panteras', since the actresses were very beautiful and sexy. Therefore, in Brazil, `Charlie's Angels' are `The Panthers'. Many jokes in this movie does not make sense for those who does not understand English. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): `As Panteras Detonando' (`The Panthers Blasting')",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
4,gavin6942,A Sequel,5,13 September 2017,"The Angels investigate a series of murders which occur after the theft of a witness protection profile database.What this film did right: the soundtrack. With bands like Electric Six, White Zombie, Prodigy and more, this kicks more butt than just about any other soundtrack. Also, the inclusion of actual cannibal Shia Labeouf is nice touch.What they did wrong: just about everything else. First of all, the addition of Bernie Mac to replace Bill Murray. You cannot replace Bill Murray. And then, just the weakness of it all. The whole point seems to be to make a movie even fluffier than the first, and try to make Cameron Diaz even more unlikable.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
5,jboothmillard,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,2,7 July 2008,"The only good reason to see this sequel to the equally awful girlie action film based on the popular TV show, was a bit more titillation from the three leading ladies, that's all director McG (Joseph McGinty Nichol) has to offer. You remember the previous film, three female agents, Natalie Cook (gorgeous Razzie nominated Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (the beautiful Razzie nominated Drew Barrymore, also producing the film) and Alex Munday (stunning Lucy Liu) work for mysterious Charles Townsend, or just Charlie (who we only hear the voice of, by Dynasty's John Forsythe). This time their mission is to recover two stolen rings that have something to do with witness protection identities. They are helped along the way by new Bosley, Jimmy (Bernie Mac), and they are being targeted by betraying ex-angel Madison Lee (Razzie winning Demi Moore) and others, including Ray Carter (Terminator 2's Robert Patrick), and returning Thin Man (Back to the Future's Crispin Glover). Also starring American Psycho's Justin Theroux as Seamus O'Grady, Rodrigo Santoro as Randy Emmers, Shia LaBeouf as Max, Matt LeBlanc as Jason, Luke Wilson as Pete, John Cleese as Mr. Munday, Ja'net DuBois as Momma Bosley, Jackie Brown's Robert Forster as Roger Wixon, singer Pink as Coal Bowl Starter, Carrie Fisher as Mother Superior, Chris Pontius as Irish Henchman, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as Future Angels and Bruce Willis (!) as William Rose Bailey. The fight scenes are even stupider than before, the special effects don't help much, the story has hardly real point, well, there's no point seeing it. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie (All Concept/No Content!), Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture. Pretty poor!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
6,Tweekums,More silly fun,6,16 November 2016,"Charlie's Angels; Natalie, Dylan and Alex, are back; this time they are investigating the theft of two rings which when used together gives access to data on everybody in America's witness protection programme. To further complicate matters one of those who could be exposed is Dylan. She was put in witness protection after testifying against her then boyfriend; he is now out of jail and looking for revenge.The first film was pretty silly; this one was even sillier so if you didn't enjoy the first film you almost certainly won't like this; however if you did like it you'll probably enjoy this too. The story is solid enough although it is told in a way that seems very episodic. These episodes are mostly references to other films; some of these references are rather fun while others are more than a little forced. If you don't get all the references it doesn't really detract from ones enjoyment though. There is plenty of action but not much of it feels real due to the less than impressive special effects and fights that aren't believable. When the identity of the lead bad-guy is revealed I doubt many will be surprised but that doesn't really detract from the film. Returning leads Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are solid enough and Bernie Mac is okay as the new Bosley, although nowhere near as good as Bill Murray was in the first film. There are quite a few cameos, some are good, like John Cleese's appearance as Alex's father, and some pointless, such as Bruce Willis's very brief appearance. Overall I'd say this was fun enough but nothing special; if you liked the first film then give this one a go.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
7,BA_Harrison,I have my limits.,3,22 February 2015,"'Angels' Natalie, Dylan and Alex (Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu) investigate the theft of a pair of top-secret rings that hold the details of those on the F.B.I.'s witness protection programme.I gave the first Charlie's Angels movie a fairly reasonable rating (6.5/10) for its excessive action, knowingly daft plot, deliberately cheesy performances, and impossibly sexy trio of stars. Director McG and his lovely leading ladies clearly didn't care that the whole thing was highly preposterous: they were having fun, and that fun proved infectious.This sequel definitely lives up to it's title of Full Throttle—it's even more dumb, has even more OTT action, and features even more of Diaz, Barrymore and Liu in revealing attire (plus added T&A from a very fit Demi Moore). The film doesn't just go up to eleven it goes right off the meter, but in doing so it disproves the theory that nothing succeeds like excess by being bloody irritating instead of enjoyable.Watch it for: the eye candy, which includes Cameron Diaz in a bikini, all three girls in stripper gear, Demi in her undies and, during the end credits, the Angels doing a sexy car wash—plus Crispin Glover being Crispin Glover, and the cool soundtrack.Be prepared to hate: all of the action scenes, Bernie Mac as Bosley, the pointless cameos from Pink, Bruce Willis, and the Olsen twins, the meandering senseless plot, Luke Wilson and Matt LeBlanc as Diaz and Liu's love interests, John Cleese's embarrassingly unfunny turn as Liu father, and Shia LaBeouf as an obnoxious, curly-haired brat.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
8,wes-connors,Angels with Dirty Faces,4,25 January 2009,"The script seems more coherent, compared to the last one... It's comic book live action storytelling... The production is very much like a string of music videos... The worst musical interlude is something involving angels Drew Barrymore (Dylan), Cameron Diaz (Natalie), and Lucy Liu (Alex) as ""Sound of Music"" nuns cruising a cute priest, then playing with bird poop... ""Bosley"" becomes a noun instead of a character, with Bernie Mac taking over the role - upping the level of ""broad comedy"". The original series had a more subtle wit.The Angels don't show any more than they showed in the sexier ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000). But, you do have a tighter story, and some much appreciated continuity. Original angel Jaclyn Smith (Kelly) makes a heavenly cameo appearance, and Demi Moore (Madison) ""returns"" from an untold intervening era. She seems a little like Kate Jackson, but takes a ""wrong turn"". There is quite a long span before Moore emerges as a main character - after Barrymore's villainous former boyfriend takes center stage.**** Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (6/18/03) McG ~ Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Demi Moore, Lucy Liu",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
9,BandSAboutMovies,At least Crispin Glover is in it,4,7 April 2020,"The Angels are all back, as is Crispin Glover as The Thin Man in the next installment of this series. This time, however, Bosley's half brother, played by Bernie Mac, is in charge and the Angels are going up against one of their own. This entire film is packed with cameos and more comedy than the original, which is OK. In times like these, it's a nice bit of fluff that goes down easy.Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore) and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu) are up against former angel Madison Lee (Demi Moore) as well as numerous criminal organizations.Jaclyn Smith returns as one of the original girls. You also get John Cleese as Alex's dad, Bruce Willis as a federal agent, Robert Forester, the Olsen twins, Carrie Fisher as a nun and many, many, many early 00's celebrities.

10,michaelRokeefe,Crime fighting is still looking good.,4,4 July 2003,"A series of murders and a stolen database of witness protection profiles reunites Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Luy Liu. The captivating trio once again demonstrates their more than apt martial arts and talent for disguise. They cross paths with a former ""angel"" gone bad(Demi Moore). Bernie Mac plays Jimmy Bosley and provides some comic relief. Really, who needs a script? Partake of the eye candy and feel your blood pressure simmer.Demi Moore is still drop dead gorgeous. She does wonders for a bikini. Miss Diaz proves again to be charming, sexy and very talented. Damn, can that ""angel"" dance. Barrymore still has that way of being cute and funny without losing an ounce of sex appeal. I just can't seem to say that much for Liu. There is an all-star lineup in support:Crispin Glover, Robert Patrick, Luke Wilson and Matt LeBlanc. Watch for the cameo by Bruce Willis. Yes, John Forsythe is still the voice of ""Charlie"".

11,sunwarrior13,A Shallow Sequel,6,16 September 2012,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is an action comedy film. It is the sequel to 2000's Charlie's Angels. In an ensemble cast, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu return as Natalie, Dylan, and Alex respectively. It also features Demi Moore, Shia LaBeouf, Robert Patrick, Crispin Glover, Justin Theroux, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson, John Cleese, and, replacing Bill Murray in the role of Bosley, Bernie Mac.It was directed by McG.The three most glamorous and butt-kicking private detectives in the business are back and ready to take on bad guys in this sequel to the screen adaptation of the once-popular television series. Dylan, Natalie, and Alex are once again summoned to the office of their boss Charlie, where they're introduced to his new right-hand man Bosley and given their latest assignment. It seems a pair of rings have gone missing and need to be recovered, but this was no ordinary jewel heist -- the rings have been coded with special information that can be used to access a list of every person in the FBI's Witness Protection Program, and when a handful of protected informants are murdered, the Angels are brought in to help crack the case. As the women search for the culprits, they encounter Madison Lee, one of Charlie's former agents who decided that the wrong side of the law pays better, and Seamus, who once dated Dylan and wants revenge for her decision to turn him over to the police.This was a bad sequel as it has no sensible plot and flat line performances from most of the cast.The special effects sequences, silly jokes, tantalizing outfits and overbearing soundtrack seem painfully forced and fake.And most of all,it was shallow.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
12,Theo Robertson,Full Throttle Garbage,2,6 January 2005,"There's little in the universe more irritating than someone who thinks they're funny and cool when they're patently not . This also extends to the cinematic universe where the makers of a movie are deluded that their baby is funny and cool while the rest of the planet scratch their head wondering how a film studio could waste so much money on a projectCHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE is a case in point . In the opening sequence we're treated to a set piece so ridiculous silly and overblown that the producers of the Roger Moore era Bond movies would have turned the scene down as being too unrealistic . the irritation gets worse as the movie continues and notice I say "" movie "" and not "" story "" because there isn't a story per se just a series of over the top and under explained set pieces with MTV editing , MTV cinematography and a MTV soundtrack . As you'd expect the film lacks anything resembling decent acting or charaterisation I doubt if I can recommend this to fans of the original series far less to people who are looking for a good movie . It's got lots of fit young women who spend much of the movie not wearing much and that's still not a good enough reason to recommend CHARLIE's ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
13,preppy-3,And I thought the first one was bad!,2,8 July 2003,"Totally worthless sequel to the first equally worthless movie.  The plot is stupid (it makes one of the old episodes of the TV series seem like Shakespeare); the movie is chock full of deafening explosions and needlessly loud special effects (I had to cover my ears once); the jokes are abysmal (I groaned aloud at a few) and contained some stunts that were so over the top I actually yelled ""Oh come on!"" a few times (but nobody could hear me over the soundtrack.Also the sexism is in high gear (again).  Purportedly we're supposed to applaud this movie because it shows strong, intelligent women single handedly beating up bad guys.  True--that is good.  But they're always dressed in VERY tight or revealing clothes (of course there's the required beach sequence when they're all in bikinis), and are CONSTANTLY having water thrown on them or are inexplicably getting wet (notice how conveniently the water sprinklers start when they're walking over a lawn).  This happens all throughout the movie and got annoying.Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are as good as anyone could be and Bernie Mack, Robert Patrick and Matt LeBlanc were very good in supporting roles.  And it's great to see Demi Moore back in films (even if she still can't act).  The songs in the movie were good and I must admit the stunts, while VERY stupid, were eyepopping.  Still, I hated this movie.  I guess my taste for mindless, loud summer movies has peaked.  This should be avoided.  Notice...the majority of people voting on this gave it a 1.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
14,zardoz-13,"Outshines the original ""Charlie's Angels""",9,6 February 2008,"Yes, the new summer movie sequel ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" outshines the original ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000). This helium-filled hokum with its high octane action sequences, bevies of bikini-clad babes, and naughty but nice PG-13-rated sexual innuendos qualifies both as funnier but far more violent. Aside from the conspicuous absence of both Bill Murray and Tom Green, virtually everybody from ""Charlie's Angels"" returns, with former music video director Joseph McGinty Nichol, credited simply as McG, back in the saddle calling the shots. (Reportedly, Murray refused to reprise his role as Bosley, because Lucy Liu and he hated working together on the first film.) Like its original big-screen predecessor, this slightly longer (105 minutes compared with 99 minutes) sequel takes the classic prime-time TV series beyond anything Farrah Fawcett and her curvaceous cohorts could ever have imagined. Not only does ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" kiss off realism with blissful abandon, but also this swiftly-paced, super-charged, wish-fulfillment fantasy earns half of its kudos for its well-crafted homages to popular Hollywood hits as well as its interesting cameos. Watch closely, and you may catch a glimpse of Carrie Fisher of ""Star Wars,"" Bruce Willis of ""Die Hard,"" Eric Bogosian of ""Talk Radio,"" original Angel Jaclyn Smith herself, and the Olsen twins. Meanwhile, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu portray women empowered either by their mastery of modern technology or their combat skills to thwart their evil-minded adversaries at the behest of a disembodied male voice on a speaker phone. Happily, ""Full Throttle"" never takes itself seriously. Further, nothing in this action-oriented chick flick remotely looks believable. Beyond its superbly-staged Hong Kong martial arts fights and Russell Carpenter's luminous wide-screen cinematography, ""Full Throttle"" represents actress Demi Moore's long-awaited comeback movie after a string of film flops including ""G.I. Jane,"" ""The Juror,"" and ""Striptease."" While the first ""Angels"" movie dealt strictly with revenge against their unseen boss Charlie, ""Full Throttle"" focuses on a dastardly plot to expose the identities of everybody in the Federal Witness Protection program. Never heard of the Witness Protection Program? Essentially, law enforcement relies heavily on this program so people will testify against major league criminals. Afterward, the government gives these brave souls new identities, so they can escape reprisals from the convicted criminals or their criminal organizations. In ""Full Throttle,"" the lead villain, Madison Lee (Demi Moore) has her henchmen steal two rings worn by different guys in the Dept. of Justice. When these two rings are combined, they yield an ultra-secret computer program with everybody's new identity. Naturally, ""Full Throttle"" takes full advantage of this ""Lord of the Rings"" idea and gives the concept a clever make-over to accommodate their storyline. Although this constitutes the main plot, ""Full Throttle"" really concerns the theme of friendship between our trio of Angels. Dylan (Drew Barrymore), Alex Lucy Liu), and Natalie (Cameron Diaz) have moved into a new place, and Natalie's boyfriend Pete (Luke Wilson of ""Home Fries"") keeps trying to pop a certain question. Worst than any villain with whom they must contend, Dylan and Alex dread Natalie's inevitable departure because they fear Pete wants to marry her. Invariably, at least according to Dylan, this means that Alex and she will have to break in a new Angel.The charm of the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies lies in their giddy, effervescent innocence. The bubble bursts only with an occasional moment of drama when someone dies or extracts a bloody shard of glass from their ribs. Otherwise, McG directs with his customary flair. Watching ""Full Throttle"" is like riding a roller coaster. Actually, ""Full Throttle"" resembles a video game more than a live-action movie. Most of the graphics appear computer-generated more than real-life. However, in a flashy, frivolous film like ""Full Throttle"" that proves more an asset than a debit. Moreover, McG plays everything for a laugh, and he has the light touch to make it work repeatedly without making it seem too silly. The opening sequence when the Angels rescue a U.S. Marshal (Robert Patrick of ""Terminator 2"") from a Mongolian strong-hold is the best scene. You can tell that the James Bond movie ""GoldenEye"" served as their inspiration, but the same thing occurred in the original ""Charlie's Angels"" when they cribbed their opening scene from ""Moonraker."" What is important is that they add enough variation to their make-over so the scene succeeds on its own more than as a slick rehash. Demi Moore makes a strong villain, stronger than Kelly Lynch from the original. Mercifully, Tom Green is gone, but Alex's boyfriend Jason (Matt LeBlanc of ""Friends"") shows up again, and we get to meet Alex's befuddled father played by Monty Python alumni John Cleese. Further, the superficial but exciting screenplay by John August and co-writers Wormac and Marianne Wibberley develops the Angels characters while at the same they foreshadow events in the story. Indeed, the bulk of the story is action, action, action, but it is refreshing to see a movie that actually foreshadows and fleshes out its characters.Although the clever one-liners and risqué dialogue verge on sensuality, ""Charlie's Angels"" avoids graphic depictions of anything realistic or unsavory. Nevertheless, based on the star wattage of our three heroines and McG's light fingered directorial prowess, ""Full Throttle"" is a lot of fun from teenagers and adults.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
15,Calicodreamin,"Some fun moments, but overwhelmingly ridiculous",5,7 November 2019,"Charlie's angels full throttle falls into the same pitfall that many sequels do, trying too hard to duplicate the success of the first film. There's an obvious attempt to amp up the action scenes which only succeeds in making them ridiculous and too far fetched. The cgi isn't terrible, but it's too unbelievable. The plot is a bit muddled with too many characters and too many tangents. There are some funny moments, Bernie Mac shines as Bosley, and the angels' chemistry is great.

16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just when you thought sequels were as bad as they would get...,5,17 September 2005,"Judging from just how poor the first film was, I'd have guessed it set the tone. I suppose it did, but I'd never have imagined the sequel to be even worse. The odd thing is, the film is basically exactly the same. It's like Terminator 2; just enough things are changed around in order to make it an actual sequel rather than a remake(obviously, though, this is where the similarities between the two films stop). Every single scene is basically the same as the one in the first... with few, minor changes. Of course, being a sequel, it has to be pushed to the extreme... so that's what McG did. He took the first film and made it more extreme. So we've got the exact same structure, pacing and plot. We've even got the same twists. Yes, seriously. I don't know if McG actually did wake up one morning before writing this film and said: ""I wonder if I can get away with doing the exact same film again? Will anyone notice? Will anyone care? Will it matter at all?"" I don't know if he did say that to himself, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did. The problem with pushing it further like this is that the first was stylized and very... out there. Making that more extreme is not a good idea. The result is pretty much a feature length music video, and by the time the film is done, you'll be very tired of the MTV-editing, the high requirement of suspension of disbelief and the pitiful attempts at actual drama. It's so clear that McG is and always will be a music video director... he can't do films properly. The whole thing comes off as forced; there's no chemistry or real emotion anywhere to be found here. The way the film is like a remake, but with some big details changed around screws up more than you'd think. The Thin Man has a different part this time around, and his character is hideously exaggerated. The new Bosley just doesn't have the charisma of the old one. Seriously, Bernie Mac to replace Bill Murray? Please. The humor is terribly overdone. There's a gag that goes on for about five minutes, based on a one-note joke. Of course, there are one or two fairly clever puns and one-liners... but there are a dozen or two painfully bad ones. The cameos are cool enough. The extreme sports are too... uh, extreme. They're just overdone and overly 'macho'... there's so much testosterone in the film that it can be used as a hormone injection. Really, there's hardly anything in this film worth your time... which makes it even less than what the first film had. Well, I suppose the sex and action is fairly good... especially in the unrated version, which I saw. But apart from that, there's nothing here. Absolutely nothing. If you pricked a hole in this film, it would deflate. I recommend this only to huge fans of T and A, possibly of the stars of it and, if such people exist, of the first film. Everyone else(apart from obviously straight teen guys) should avoid this film like the plague. 5/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
17,gridoon2021,"Fluff, Part 2",5,26 July 2009,"This sequel to ""Charlie's Angels"" is pretty much more of the same - energetic, colorful and cartoonish fluff. There are parts that work: the girls spontaneously dancing to M.C. Hammer's ""U Can't Touch This""; Jacklyn Smith's guest appearance as Kelly Garrett (she still looks great); brief moments of the fight scenes, mainly the one near the dock, that show Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu can do this even without the wires; Demi Moore's bad-girl role (though I still prefer Kelly Lynch from the original). However, much of the time is again taken by not-especially-funny supporting characters and way overblown action sequences, some of which (the pre-title, the one with the bikes, etc.) seem to have been done at least 75% on a computer. The cast is game and clearly had fun, if only McG could restrain himself a little the audience might have more fun too. ** out of 4.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Opening scene would fit perfectly in a James Bond film but here it looks plain stupid. It involves the theft and retrieval of two rings that contain secret information. Then the narrow escape follows as a truck goes over a bridge and the Angels land in a helicopter. Then there is the escape criminal connected with Drew Barrymore's past. Cameron Diaz is waiting for her dipstick boyfriend to propose. Lucy Liu's father visits unaware of her real job. The only good performance comes from Demi Moore as an evil Angel who states, ""I'm tired of taking orders from a speaker box."" She is ideal casting and pulls off a surprise victory until it is diminished when she shoots all three Angels only to discover that they had on bulletproof vests. That is conveniently pathetic and perhaps the single worst element in a long list of bad issues that is wrong with this garbage. Bernie Mac replaces Bill Murray who wisely avoided a second helping of this bullshit. Filmed like a music video by McG going fully high tech in production with little evidence of a screenwriter. He made the first film, which isn't much better. Both films should be throttled with a tire iron and buried somewhere where they will never surface again.

If you like lots of up beat music, hot looking chicks in all different situations and angles, you will definitely not want to miss this film. Drew Barrymore,( Dylan Sanders) had doubts about herself being a successful Charlie Angel and did her very best to upset Demi Moore(Madison Lee), who was trying to completely destroy the Angels from the face of the earth. Matt LeBlanc,(Jason), gave some spark whenever he appeared in a scene.

20,JamesHitchcock,"Still Room for Improvement, Drew!",5,18 October 2007,"It is often said that sequels are, as a rule, never as good as the original film. The first ""Charlie's Angels"" movie was a typical brain-dead popcorn blockbuster, a serious case of film-making without due care and attention, so if that rule held good in every case the second instalment in the franchise would have been dire indeed. Like most rules, however, this one has exceptions, and, rather surprisingly, ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" proved to be one of them, possibly because the original was so poor that almost anything would have been an improvement.Three years after their original cinematic disaster, producer-star Drew Barrymore and the enigmatically named director McG got the chance to try again, and it really does seem as though they were trying to learn from their mistakes. The plot is still complicated, but at least there is some attempt to produce something coherent. The Angels are tasked with trying to rescue a kidnapped US Marshal from Mongolia. They succeed, but it later transpires that he is implicated in a plot to supply details of the witness protection programme to various criminal gangs. The vital data about the programme can only be deciphered with the aid of two rings, one of which belongs to the Marshal. The owner of the other has been murdered and the ring stolen. The Angels must try and recover the two rings before the protected witnesses are put at risk.Besides plot, the scriptwriters have also paid more attention to characterisation. In the original film the Angels had more or less interchangeable personalities; here there is some attempt to differentiate them. Natalie is a fun-loving surfer chick. Alex is an proper young lady; her father, presumably adoptive, is revealed to be an English gentleman played by John Cleese. (This detail may have been added as an explanation of something that baffled me about the original film, namely why an obviously Chinese girl had the Anglo-Saxon surname Munday). Dylan is a former wild child who has reformed her ways (a bit like Drew Barrymore herself, really). There is even an attempt to provide Dylan with a back-story; she was formerly a gangster's girlfriend until she told the police about a murder he had committed and helped to put him in jail. Much of the plot concerns his attempts to get revenge.The film also has a convincing villain, unlike its predecessor where the characters played by Kelly Lynch and Sam Rockwell were particularly colourless. Tim Curry's arrogant tycoon seemed more promising, but turned out not to be the real enemy and was killed off early. In ""Full Throttle"" the villain of the piece is Madison Lee, a former Angel turned ruthless criminal. The character provided something of a comeback role for Demi Moore, one of the most glamorous stars of the late eighties and early nineties but who had done little in the cinema since ""GI Jane"" in 1997. She was in her early forties when she made this film, but still strikingly attractive, and makes Madison the best sexy villainess since Sophie Marceau's Elektra King in ""The World is Not Enough"".""Full Throttle"" still has its weaknesses. Too much of the humour consists of bawdy puns and innuendos so blatant that even the ""Carry On"" series would have blushed at them. (Sample: ""You were the cock. I was the beaver!""- Natalie, speaking to a boy she knew at school is ostensibly referring to the animals they played in a pageant, but as Americans, unlike we Brits, normally say ""rooster"" when referring to a male chicken, this is the sort of double entendre which can only be taken one way).Although some of the action sequences, such as the motor-bike race, are good fun, the endless stylised, slow-motion fight scenes in which the Angels seem to have the miraculous ability to dodge bullets are no better than those in the first film. One positive drawback is the replacement of Bill Murray by the less effective Bernie Mac as Charlie's assistant Bosley.The second ""Angels"" film may have been better than the first, but that is in itself no great achievement, and it still falls some way short of being a positively good film. Should Drew Barrymore be considering a third episode in the series, there is plenty of room for further improvement. 5/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Wow, that is pretty sad, isn't it?",2,28 October 2006,"I know that the Charlie's Angels series was kind of hokey and I think that's what they were going for with for the sequel. I figured that I would give it a shot and see if this was any kind of an improvement from the first movie, and I have to say: Nope. It was really disappointing and had way too much CGI effects, not to mention, I'm sorry to disappoint, but I bet you anything, CGI helped with Demi's looks as well.The second Charlie's Angels is about how the girls need to get ahold of a loose file of the witness protection program, that also includes Dylan, she was formally known as ""Helen Zass"", which that joke was well played out, and the angels meet old wings gone bad, Madison Lee. She is the leader of the gang that is trying to find all the people in the witness protection program and kill them.Like I said, some jokes were just too played out and the CGI was way out of control. It's really sad that movies like this get a huge budget while other movies with great potential get diddley! Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was mainly about money and a cheap soft porn dream for all the teenage boys! I'm sorry, but I would recommend to stay away from this flick.2/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
22,=G=,"An ""E"" for effort and an ""F"" for floparoo!",5,21 October 2003,"The verdict is in and hopeful critics and public alike seem to agree that director McG pushed the envelope so far it broke and turned  ""CA:FT"" into a colossal dud. Not an uncommon problem when one is trying to out do himself with a sequel, especially for a young auteur working in the action genre. McG appears to have fallen victim to that more-is-more mentality as he takes the ""Angels"" into the realm of action movie super heroes of comic book proportion. The loss is credibility, personality, and humanness...qualities which keep us riveted to the screen through all the action and fluff for there is no suspense or thrill if good is unequivocally invincible and the doom of evil a foregone conclusion. Perhaps the most sadly laughable moment in this film is when Demi Moore's trains her Desert Eagle on the speaker box with a tear running down one cheek. At that moment it is blindingly obvious that someone should have been working smarter, not harder.  You can bet that when the ""CA:FT"" audience laughed, they weren't laughing -with- the auteur, but at him. For action junkies only. (C)",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The crime fighters, played by Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, return in this film to investigate a series of murders that occur after the theft of a witness protection profile database.For me, the Angels lost their charm and fun, being portrayed as too campy and wild in this movie. The plot was slow-paced and dreary and the acting was campy. Bill Murray was great as Bosley from the first movie and I thought it was a bad idea to bring in Bernie Mac to replace him - didn't do such a good job as Murray did playing the character. And, Demi Moore was pretty mediocre playing the lead villain.While some nice action, above all, there was just too much overdone elements; the special effects and stunts were overboard and the characters lack substance. For pure entertainment, I would just stick with the first film.Grade D",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

They contain secret information that, when decrypted, reveal information on everyone in the Federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses on the list start turning up dead, it's obvious the Angels will have to step up their efforts. But the baddie is someone well known to the Angels - someone who knows the way the Angels work and think. In fact, she was once an Angel herself. I really got a kick out of the first Charlie's Angels movie. It was dumb, but it was fun. In Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle there's just too much. I'm not sure I've seen this since I originally saw it in the theater, so I forgot how busy it all is. There are too many jokes, there are too many ridiculous situations, there are too many over-the- top fight scenes, there is too much of Cameron Diaz's booty shaking (if that's possible), and there is way, way too much CGI. The first movie took the original Charlie's Angels and turned it up a notch or two. This one rips the knob off. It proves the old adage that too much of a good thing can sometimes be a bad thing. The highlight of the film for me is the cast. Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore all have a charm to them that's a joy to watch. When the film is just the three of them without the huge special effects, these moments work. Unfortunately, these scenes are too few and far between. Also, I really enjoyed seeing Demi Moore. But then again, I always enjoying seeing Demi Moore.Unfortunately, there's not much here to recommend.

26,bowmanblue,Warning: not to be taken seriously,7,29 December 2014,"The first Charlie's Angels film, starring Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lui, was a success, therefore it got the inevitable sequel. However, despite much promotion from the studio, it picked up more than its fair share of harsh criticism, turning it into a bit of a 'flop.' Personally, I really enjoyed it. Yes, it's daft. Yes, it's cheesy. And, yes, some scenes look more like they belong in an advert for shampoo. But, at the end of the day, it's pretty harmless fun. Before you watch it, you just have to sit down with the biggest pinch of salt you've ever taken to get the most out of it.The phrase 'in real life' isn't needed when watching Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Nothing here is applicable to real life. Three wafer thin women kick the hell out of numerous muscular men (and Demi Moore) without coming away with a scratch. Stupid. But stupid fun. It never tries to take itself seriously, with its playful use of daft sound effects and numerous sexual innuendos. It's about as true to life as a Roger Moore James Bond film (of which I'm also a huge fan!).Men will doubtless have the added bonus of watching three Hollywood women in a range of 'flattering' and most revealing costumes. Maybe the producers of the film will try to make us believe that this is some sort of 'feminist' movie with powerful women beating up men. Hmm, that's one I won't dare to even try to debate! Ultimately, think of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle as a life-action cartoon, as it's more cartoonish than real. If you think you can do that, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're all for realistic, gritty, dark action, then you're probably better off with something like The Bourne Identity, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, or Daniel Craig's Bond reboot.Note: added kudos for the film-makers for getting Bruce Willis assassinated by his ex wife - made me chuckle anyway!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

I don't think that this motion picture gets much in the way of intellectual, cerebral, dramatic awards, but it attempts so show a lot of female flesh, alot of fun and cute parodies, swinging to the oldies and goldies music of the fast going 60s, and remarkably brings up some strong suggestions of the old television series itself.

28,slightlymad22,A Lot Of Fun. I Enjoyed It,7,1 February 2015,"This movie caught me at just the right time, I'd had a pretty intense day with 8 episodes of ""The Walking Dead"", when I caught it just starting on TV, and this ridiculous bit of fun was perfect to lighten the mood. Having not seen the first movie, I do not know how it compares, but I do know this was a lot of fun and Demi Moore steals the show.Plot in A Paragraph: Natalie Cameron Diaz) Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Lui) are three gorgeous, tough-as-nails, investigative agents 'Charlie's Angels' who work for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency - are sent undercover to retrieve two missing titanium wedding rings. That contain information that reveals the new identities of every person in the Witness Protection Program. After several people in the program are found dead, only the Angels can save the day, using their expertise as masters of disguise, and martial arts.Some of the special effects don't hold up, and if you are looking for something realistic, or believable you are in the wrong place, but the world needs movies that are just a bit of silliness too.Diaz, Lui and Barrymore are all a lot of fun, and certainly give it their all, Justin Theroux is a good villain (even with a dodgy Irish accent) Cameos by Bruce Willis, Matt LeBlanc, Pink, John Cleese, Luke Wilson, Carrie Fisher, Crispib Glover add to the fun, yet Shia Lebouf is even more annoying that before (How is that possible??) I will add, I'll never be able to hear the ""Pink Panther Theme"" without visualising Cameron Diaz's ass in a thong.As for Demi Moore, she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

30,TheMovieDiorama,Charlie's Angels Full Throttle fully accelerates whilst narratively stuck in second gear.,4,27 December 2019,"Can I order a McG sandwich please? Huh? You have no filling? Sure, I'll just take the overly stylised sauce. My personal adoration for this sequel's predecessor is one that cannot be described fully without tackling the realms of lunacy and diminishing my own critical insight. It's just a special piece of camp nostalgia for me, even if its construction is more amateurish than Diaz' dance moves. Interestingly, this continuation was also on repeat as I galloped around the room to the soundtrack of The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers, witnessing physically impossible aerobatic stunts. However, after all these years, it's time to succumb to the realisation that Full Throttle is a bad film.Much like the first feature, its plot is a secondary product to the outlandish femme fatale antics. This time the angels must secure two H.A.L.O. rings which probably has something to do with monetisation and greed. Don't ask me! For I honestly do not know. A stationery Barrymore sliding fully under a low table without the use of her arms had me entranced. Liu leaping sixty feet into the air by just jumping off a table had me hypnotised. And of course, Diaz bopping to MC Hammer's ""U Can't Touch This"" had me salivating. These, including the last point (have you tried side stepping that rapidly!?), are physically impossible to perform.The wired stunts and choreography are so exaggerated that it becomes laughably terrible, juxtaposing the semi-realistic narrative that McG is attempting to convey. Driving off a dam whilst trying to fly into a helicopter and take off (all in mid-air by the way...) before it crashes? Sure. Why not. Performing motocross stunts whilst upside down and shooting the angels? Eh. I'll let it slide. Using a lace cape as a squirrel suit, throwing a bomb into a film premiere and perfectly landing in a car whilst being pursed by the angels who are hanging onto illuminated wires? Ummm. I guess. Being tossed through a shop window, like a rag doll, and walking it off before getting changed for the premiere? Now wait just a minute! Heightened stunts and 'Matrix'-styled slow motion is all fine and dandy, but I need an ounce of realism in order to feel threatened by the danger on screen. The angels are invulnerable to everything, making the entire ordeal worthless.Yes, using a flamethrower to ""Firestarter"" is bonafide brilliance and shaped me to be the man that I am today. Yet the random action set pieces (to which there are loads!) cannot justify the narrative's direction. Again, frustrating considering the onscreen chemistry of Diaz, Barrymore and Liu. The one and only Demi Moore is used for an underdeveloped plot twist, as she suggestively licks Diaz' face. Oh, and Bernie Mac replaced Murray. A fine replacement, but again, under-utilised. Let's not even discuss Theroux's insulting Irish accent. The technical aspects, especially the garish green screen and floaty human CGI, unintentionally adds characteristics to the film in general, yet still executed terribly. And the callback ""humour"", mostly consisting of the ""creepy thin man"" and the angels' relationship, were cringeworthy at best. Although, the ongoing innuendos between Alex and her father did make me chuckle continuously.Is it enough to substantiate a sequel that showcases the apparent curse of ""more is better""? Absolutely not. Whilst the heart of Charlie's Angels resides within, its discombobulated exterior diminished most of the heavenly fun to be had.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

32,FiendishDramaturgy,Fun Sequel.,8,31 October 2003,"This movie has been dogged by nearly every critic here at IMDb as being an insult to the original and/or just an all-around bad film, but IMO, it is highly misunderstood.This film, in reality, is at least two times better than the first. Bear with me on this, please. I realize that, as usual, I'm in the minority in my opinion.The obvious camp in this film was not unintentional. The tongue-in-cheek humor and delivery was perfectly indicative of the original series and therefore an homage, not an insult, to that series.The effects were intentionally over-dramatized, again, with tongue-in-cheek humor, demonstrating the industry's disdain for itself and the direction in which it is headed (CGI, CGI, CGI).Jaclyn Smith appearing as Kelly Garret was, in her own way, her seeming endorsement of this installment, and a touching tribute to this job well done.This story line was creative, imaginative, and solid. The performances were professional, and delivered with humor, and intelligent wit. You have but to look with an open mind. This production was not intended to be the action flick of the year, nor was it meant to be the comedy of the year. It hits somewhere in between and finds itself in a position of intellectual homage; a vastly misunderstood vehicle. While not a parody, it - at the same time - was. It was, however, not as obvious as ""Spaceballs"" was to ""Star Wars,"" or ""Blazing Saddles"" was to the ""western"" genre, thereby leaving open the window of misunderstanding which, apparently, most people willingly leaped through.This movie was FUN, and end the end, isn't that what's important?It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
33,freemantle_uk,McG!!!!!!!!!!,1,28 September 2009,"Charlie's Angels is one hell of a franchise. It started off as a bad television show in the 1970. Drew Barrymore brought the rights to the show for her Flower Films production company, as a pet project for her and hired McG (most stupid name ever!) because she liked his promos, music videos and adverts. The first Charlie's Angels film was by no means a cinematic classic but it has some enjoyable action scenes and made a big profit at the box office. A sequel was inevitable and had a number of writers involved, including the pretty good John August to Simon Kinberg, one of the worst writers in Hollywood.The plot, what there is of it, is two titanium rings with everyone on the US Witness Protection programme's details on them have been stolen and placed on auction for the highest bidder. The Angels, have been asked by the US Marshalls to find them and bring them back. On the way they have fight a lot of people including the Thin Man (Crispin Glover), Dylan's (Drew Barrymore) ex Irish boyfriend Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux) and ex-angel Madison Lee (Demi Moore). Within the film they are sub-plots, like Alex's (Lucy Liu) dad (John Cleese) visiting and having to relieve that she is really a crime-fighter, not a neuro-surgeon. Natalie (Cameron Diaz) moves in with her boyfriend. And Dylan relieves she is one the Witness Protection list and worries about the break up Angels.I have nothing wrong with films just setting themselves out to be fun, but they is still a basis requirement of being coherent. The script and the direction lack both. They is barely a plot; the film makes fun of Mission: Impossible II, but even that is a better film then this. McG's inexperience as a storyteller shows. He's background as a music video director shows, because just focuses on stylist set pieces and can't tell a story. Charlie's Angels is a collection of bits, from the almost James Bond style pre-credit scene, to the fight with the Irish guys to the Cape Fear reference. The film at times tries to be like a Bond and Mission Impossible film but fails. Throughout the film the girls dress up in a number of disguises, but that wears thin really quickly. Some bits are embarrassing. The humour is flat and unfunny and they are stupid motions like when the Angels are dancing in Natalie's new house. There are some decent fight scenes, but that is not enough and there is better out there.The film has female protagonists, major women action heroes. I have no problem with that, hell, I want to see more of that. But in this film there are sexist bits, like when Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore dressing up as sexy dancers.Most of the acting is weak, but this isn't an actors film. Bosley is changed from a skinny white guy, Bill Murray, to a big black guy, Bernie Mac. I like consistency in a film series.Compare Charlie's Angel 2 to other action films that have been released around the same time. X-Men 1 and 2, the first two Bourne films, the first two Spider-man films. Audience want films with substance, with skilled, experienced story tellers at helm.McG needs to grow up, and Simon Kinberg, the writer of films like XXX 2, X-Men 3 and Jumper needs to quit the film industry.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Some of the action sequences do look a little cheap, just as far as the visuals go, but that's just some of them, most of them are pretty decent. I just really got tired of them balancing the awkward humor and weird characters with the action. I didn't know if this movie was trying to spoof Charlie's angels or if it was just really that bad.

36,rooprect,"Lighten up, peeps. It's a comedy.",6,17 December 2010,"This movie is one half Mission Impossible and one half Airplane. The combination of which not only requires 'suspension of disbelief', but I'd say you need to string your disbelief up by the roof beams and flog it mercilessly.If I haven't been clear enough, let me put it plainly: do not, I repeat, do not take this movie seriously in any way, shape or form.That much should be obvious in the first 2 minutes when we see the angels walk into a Mongolian prison camp and start riding a mechanical bull to the tune of ""Wild Thang"" while kicking the asses of hundreds of 300-lb men. I won't tell you what happens in the next 2 minutes, but it makes the first 2 minutes look like a nature documentary.I saw this movie last night and I'm still not sure what the plot is. But it was thoroughly entertaining (especially for a hetero guy who enjoys gratuitous booty shots). Some gags were pretty funny, while others were so lame you have to laugh anyway. But really the comedy is the fact that everything is so unbelievably unbelievable.Glancing at some of the reviews here, I see that the tongue-in-cheek comedy was lost on a lot of people, and instead of having a good time they probably ended up hurling things at their TV screen. I'm just here to warn you, do not fall into that trap. Realize that it's a comedy. It panders to the lowest brain cell in your skull. And it delivers a wild ride.P.S.

It is entertaining, spectacular, and full off effects. The dialog is nice and witty and the angels and the stuntmen and stuntwomen does it very good. No surprises there.Then, what makes this movie to raise above all the other action/comedies that is made is all the extra work that has been put into the movie. This includes lots of references and spoofs of other movies (just try to spot them all). Some are evident some are (according to me) more subtle. In addition there are quite a few cameos to make it even more fun to watch. And the final thing that I really liked was that the music and songs used were well integrated with the movie. The songs really worked with the movie instead of a separate piece just running parallel to it. So, the director, or whoever responsible for all this should get an extra credit. More work like this, had there only been a not totally predictable story my vote would have been even higher. Even so, a very good movie!8/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
38,Agent10,Dreadfully ridiculous,1,27 June 2003,"In an age of disposable razors and soon, disposable DVDs, why can't we have disposable movies. Truly, Charlie's Angels 2 ranks on such an agenda, producing a stink which no human being should be forced to inhale. Much like the first one, this movie is pointless, plotless and utterly stupid. What can't be put down about this movie. Sure, we know its not supposed to be realistic, but why must idiot filmmakers like McG (who must think he is really cool or something) bore and insult our intelligence with cartoonish and ridiculous action sequences that makes you want to laugh because it is so inherently stupid. Normally, I can keep track of a movie as it moves along, but this film had so little plot, one loses sight of what happens due to the fact all the music videos and random skin action are meant to avert one's attention to the fact there is no plot. Sadly, much like the equally banal The Hulk, this movie will make a lot of money, proving most Americans are nothing but a bunch of radio controled sheep (which means they are REALLY robotic). Working at a movie theater, a real quandary came across my mind when the film mysteriously started burning off the screen when I was doing the dry run. Should I let it burn, or should I stop the burn? That moment alone had more insight and plot than the entire movie.

There are a lot of famous people in nice little roles (Bruce Willis, Pink, the Olsen sisters, Matt LeBlanc) and Demi Moore as a fallen angel is fun as well. Some nice little things with the inspiration from other action-hero movies are funny as well. In one scene the villain jumps from a roof and flies to a car the way Batman flies.

42,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"No improvement,...just a downgrade",4,4 July 2019,"From the original TV show, to the big screen, Charlie's Angels had an interesting premise. It starred several female leads in action roles and made use of their charm to really bring audiences in to watch. Being that Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz were all in popular films before this, the first installment only cemented their names that they could star in the action genre. The movie adaptation of the show however was practically a mixed bag. While it had the right actors, the storytelling was weak with clichés and obsessive focus on the feminine appeal in all the wrong ways. It wasn't super crass, but it definitely could cause multiple eye rolls among the audience. But it made enough money to guarantee a sequel, and it's not any better.The film sets off with a new adventure for the leads after rescuing security agent (Robert Patrick) with a special ring that contains important information to the witness protection database. As they begin to dig deeper, they learn more to the plot than there was before. Having the screenplay written by John August, Cormac and Marianne Wibberley didn't do a whole lot. Seeing that August was the only writer from the original and the Wibberley's wrote for The 6th Day (2000) before this, the story is overly drawn out. Even with McG coming back to direct, the pacing seems to go for excessive amounts more than it should.That's not to say Diaz, Liu or Barrymore don't give their characters charm, they just unfortunately don't have much to work with except have cheesy dialog or dress in highly sexualized attire. Bernie Mac as the latest Bosley has better moments than Bill Murray's performance. That and all the other cameos and returnees that show up. There's appearances from Bruce Willis, Carrie Fischer, John Cleese, Ashley Olsen, Mary-Kate Olsen, Robert Forster, Shia LaBeouf and reappearances from John Forsythe, Luke Wilson and Matt LeBlanc. But they all have limited presence and only help further the plot, exposition wise.Of those characters, the ones that were more captivating to watch were Crispin Glover as the thin man. Justin Theroux plays an ex of Drew Barrymore's character and Demi Moore plays an ex Angel briefly. These three actors actually have moments in the movie that are more surprising to see. Sadly, they don't receive as much attention as they should. The action sequences in the film certainly have effort put into them. Seeing that McG is very familiar with these kinds of scenes, they are carried out very competently. The only flaw may be that there may be a little too much emphasis on the slow motion. At least it's not shaky cam.However that doesn't mean the special effects are always top notch either. Even for 2003, CGI did look good in several films before this. But here, there are some shots that don't look as polished, which is unfortunate. The camerawork, again handled by Russell Carpenter who worked on the first film did an okay job but it still doesn't make up for some of the weak visuals. Lastly the score by Edward Shearmur was barely present to begin with. Much of the film contains cues from other well known artists like John Bon Jovi, M.C. Hammer, The Who and Natalie Cole. It's fine, but there's no identity to the characters so oh well.It's not a terrible film, but it's also pretty bad. The material is too bland and cliché to make anything special out of it. The actors trying their best and the action sequences are really the only aspect that is almost completely flawless.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
43,Kamurai25,"I'm okay with the best joke being Lucy Liu is a prostitute, and I'm not okay with that",6,4 July 2020,"Good watch, might watch again, can recommend.Same formula, a couple different parameters, so it's good they didn't try to re-invent them, but they didn't really try to improve them either.It feels like some of the quality actors dropped out on the support side, but they definitely upped the number of guests: John Cleese (my favorite role in the entire movie), Bernie Mac, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Owen Wilson, Justin Tehroux, and even Shia LaBeouf.Most of the non-angel roles are just played for comedy, but they did manage to keep the action up with couple really cool scenes.I don't think it elevated action movies, but it was enough of a action-comedy that I can get behind it.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
44,Rob_Taylor,Will the last person out please slap McG.....HARD!,2,18 April 2004,"What can one say about this movie? Words like peurile, pointless, ridiculous, inane and so on spring immediately to mind. One reviewer commented that it was entertainment for sufferers of Attention Deficit Disorder, and I can't argue with that. If anything, that's being kind. It's more like entertainment for three year olds. At least, the last time I saw such utterly ridiculous action scenes was in a Roadrunner cartoon when I was a kid. From the opening ""truck containing helicopter falls off dam..."" scene it just goes downhill all the way.Now, when I was younger, I thought it would be cool if films had more music in them, some nice rock or even pop tunes here and there. But you can take things too far, and McZero has done exactly that here. Not just pop songs populate the film, but songs who's clever lyrics enhance the scene they're being played over.......not! You'll be cringing in embarrassment by the third or fourth song, trust me.The best thing about the film was the guy playing Bosley, whom I hated at the start, but grew to like in direct proportion to my growing contempt at the rest of the film. He alone kept me watching to the end.The angels were OK-ish, but the guy playing the ""Irish"" baddie needs some serious voice coaching. His accent was the worst Irish attempt I've seen since Burt Reynolds in Universal Soldier 3 (or was it 4?). Anyhow, he has all the menace of Scooby-Doo on Valium and overacts atrociously. There's one scene (I'll call it the Terminator 2 scene) where he looks off meaningfully to one side at the end of the scene. I can't really describe it, you have to see it. Suffice to say I could hardly breathe I was laughing so much.And Demi Moore.....Well, let's just say that all the King's plastic surgeons and all the King's beauty therapists can't hide the fact that she is getting old. Nor can dating kids half her age or less, but we won't go there. If this is her comeback I doubt we'll be seeing much of her in the future.All that McZero has done here is produce an endless music video with ludicrous action sequences interspersed throughout. That's it. There's bugger all plot, bugger all acting and pointless cameos from actors who really should know better.Things I learnt from this film, contrary to accepted physics and common sense:If you fall off a dam, there's enough time whilst you're falling to climb inside a helicopter, cold start it, then fly it to safety before being smashed to pieces.Also, never have an accident on an off-road motorbike, as they automatically explode on impact.""Irish"" bad guys are fire-resistant.A Kevlar vest will stop a .50 calibre handgun round at ten feet.Desert Eagle's (the above mentioned handgun) have so little recoil and are so easy to handle that even an aging has-been actress can use one in each hand.I could go on, but you've probably got the idea by now that I was far from impressed with this film. So let's just say that, if you're three years old this movie rocks! Otherwise it's a concrete block on it's way down to the bottom of the Ocean of Movie Obscurity. And deservedly so.NOT recommended.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
45,eric262003,It's For Those Who Like The The Art of Fun,8,19 April 2016,"Why are there so many negative reviews about ""Charlie's Angel's Full Throttle""? McG proves that you don't need logic when it comes to having a good time and a good laugh. Neither do the screenwriters John August, Cormac and Marianne Wibberley. Sure this trifecta of angels may not have wings on their backs, but they sure can defy the laws of gravity. Taken a few pages off of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz) Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore) and Alex Munday do what they do best, dodge bullets, survive explosions and kick baddies in the booties, but more importantly, stay as a cohesive unit even through wedding bells that almost split them apart. Sure it may boarder under glorifying ladies as athletic, clever, voluptuous and dangerous and while we guys are looked down as dimwitted, aggressive and foolish, but ""Charlie's Angels Full Throttle"" takes us on an energetic ride with enough high-flying action that will surely make Issac Newton's theory null and void. No matter if the plot is thinner than Olive Oyl, the quest that the angels embark on is after two rings (beat that Tolkien) that is needed by the villains so they can gain access to computer information that leads to the people enjoy the government's bountiful ways in the witness protection program. The leading villain is Madison Lee (Demi Moore) a former angel now a dark angel who obsessively needs the rings because if you put the two juxtaposed to each other, it will open up the esoteric information needed so she can sell it the leading mafioso from Japan, Italy and Latin America. While our heroes as expected find the rings, completing their initiative is where the fun commences. The costumers make-up artists (Kimberly Greene and Charyl Beasley Blackwell) the angels go incognito throughout their whole mission even to point of looking stunning like they're painting the town red. The most fun is that former music-director McG ads more thrills than the previous installment in which the angels are on the hunt working for a man who never reveals his identity. Sure it repeats itself from the first part, but hey, who can ever be bored of the James Bond style opening scene as the threesome save a man from intimidating rouges sport six foot rapiers in the Mongolian mountains? And who could forget the dirt-bike scenes with a no-hold- barred stipulation as they zoom across faster than you can say ""Ben- Hur"". The goo into a cartoon world where they push and even go far as to outrageously shoot their guns while upside down. When it comes to chemistry, Liu, Barrymore and Diaz truly have it and the alliance that these three have are some of the best ever displayed in cinematic history. The best part is no one tries to usurp the other one even though Diaz can really dance seductively. Of course the buzz will be focused on Demi Moore, who's been off the screen for a while exhibiting her her sharp skills and a Renaissance figurine body proves she can be a formidable adversary to the angels. With all the energy needed, this big budgeted film is filled with big stars supporting them like Crispin Glover as The Thin Man, Bernie Mac as Det. Bosley, and the John Cleese as Alex's dad who think due to Matt LeBlanc's subliminal wording has suspicion that Alex is biting off more than an angel could chew.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
46,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"I don't know what I just saw... ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" is entertaining, but way too dumb...",4,19 September 2009,"I never saw the 2000 movie reboot of the sort-of classic ""Charlie's Angels"" TV-show in its entirety. I saw most of it, but it was far too silly to hold my attention. Thus, a few years later, when the sequel came out, I wasn't really jumping out of my seat to see it. But I picked up a used copy of the DVD for $3 about a year ago, and I must say... What did I watch? Beauty and talent is certainly present in spades in ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"", with a cast that boasts Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui (as the three angels) and my personal favorite actress of the lot, Demi Moore. The angels, adjusting to changing lives, are charming together, but oftentimes their friendship does seem forced and overplayed. The late (and great) Bernie Mac does a good job as the replacement for Bill Murray's Bosely. And Moore is great as the sexy villainess, a former angel turned bad.Crispin Glover also returns as his freakish villain from the first film, which was nice but overdone.You may notice I skipped a plot synopsis and went straight to commenting on the actors- this is intentional, as there was no discernible plot from what I could tell. Something about rings that for some reason hold the names of all the people using the Witness Protection Services (because apparently a USB Flash-Drive or a blank CD-R was too much), and how the angels have to duel various baddies in order to get them... blah, blah, blah.Basically, the film's premise is a big excuse to show the angels shooting things and blowing set-pieces up while wearing sexy outfits that show off their bums, breasts and legs. That's literally the sole purpose of this film. This is especially apparent in a lengthy scene involving the Pussycat Dolls dancing with the angels for almost too long (I almost suffered sensory overload!), all in an effort to steal some keys from a bad-guy... A scene that could very well have been completed off-screen, or with a single five-second shot.The action in the film is well-shot, but like the first film, director McG (gotta love a guy whose name is only 3 letters) relies too much on CG and tacky, overused effects, like ""Bullet Time."" I'll admit, Bullet Time was cool when I first saw it in ""Blade"", and the following year's ""The Matrix"" made it a revolutionary new way to display action, but since those two movies, it has become yet another lame convention of films, that is just way too overdone. Wire-Fu is also done to death here, and by the end of the film, I just wished that the characters would have an old-fashioned gun-duel like in the old Western classics, because I was almost unable to stomach another goofy ""Hiya! Kia! Ha!"" filled scene of beautiful women inexplicably flying through the air like birds.I may be complaining a lot, but I will say, the film isn't all that bad. It certainly is filled with a lot of eye-candy, and there are lots of pretty things to look at on-screen. Also, the cast is very talented, and I must admit that I am a fan of Moore and Barrymore. Also, the film has almost a tad of the ""so bad, it's kinda good"" vibe you get with certain films. But all-in-all, it's utterly forgettable fluff. And while I usually like the fluff (I'm the guy who had a fun time seeing the third ""Mummy"" film, after all), there comes a point where enough is enough. When I've seen 100 minutes of nothing more than vibrant colors and scantily clad women, yet not had a single laugh, and only a few ""wows"", then something is wrong.I'm gonna give ""Charlie's Angel's: Full Throttle"" a 4 out of 10. Rent it if you'd like, but don't expect much of anything.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
47,mjw2305,Oh Dear!,4,29 December 2006,"They're back, only this time they are more ridiculous than ever before; the over the top action and fight scenes from the first film have over stepped the mark from being entertaining into being totally ludicrous, oh and they've lost Bill Murray in this outing too.The girls are still very sexy, the dialogue is still cheesy and the action is still plentiful. The trouble is the execution seems to be geared entirely around the visuals and they have forgotten about the story and the humour completely, and did i mention Bill Murray isn't in this one.Overall Charlies Angels fall hard in this low rate sequel, no matter how good Demi Moore looks; personally i think she picked a lame movie for a comeback. Oh yeah and Bill Murray isn't in this one.No More Please 4/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
48,btreakle,Full throttle,6,1 July 2020,This wasnt the best picture I have ever seen but because Drew Barrymore was in it I watched the whole thing. Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lui were good as well. But the picture needed something more. But I think some will like it.,Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
49,Sirus_the_Virus,Hated it.,1,23 August 2009,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is probably one of the worst sequels ever. I couldn't believe what happened to the great fun the Charlie's angels 2 was. I enjoyed the original, not many people did. But compared to this piece of junk, the first film was a classic. I liked the original because of the ladies. The events could happen, I suppose. Well, maybe not the Creepy Thin Man flying into a river and living and blowing up and returning for the sequel. Other than that, the film was realistic. Charlie's Angels: Full throttle was another story. Now I see why Bill Murray wasn't in it.Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle made all of the women look like superheroes. They were Indiana Jones on Estrogen. And again, more talent wasted. Bernie Mac wasn't in it much. Crispin Glover was pointless. Demi Moore was okay. But more talent wasted. What's in store for part three... Ashton Kutcher as a villain?The Three angels Natile(Cameron Diaz), Dylan( Drew Barrymore), and Alex(Lucy Liu) return. The film opens with the angels in Mongolia. They are trying to rescue a guy named Ray Carter(Robert Patrick) who is like a senator or something. Anyways, after they rescue him, the angels investigate a series of murders that occurred after the theft of a witness protection profile database. They try to protect Max(Shia Lebeouf). And get back these rings or something.The villains of the film are Madison Lee(Demi Moore), Creepy Thin Man(Crispin Glover), and some Irish guy who has the rings. The Irish guy has something to do with Dylan's past. There are some good things to say about this trash. One, of course the Angels look good. Two, Bruce Willis's cameo in the beginning. Three, John Cleese as Alex's father(How the hell are they related?)and Bernie Mac as Bosley's brother. I left out Demi Moore. She kicks the film into gear as the villain. She would make Kelly Lynch's villain cry. We didn't need Thin Man in this film. He was pretty pointless in this film.The film would be a zero. But Demi Moore still looks great in this film. For the future, MCG should make a film that's not so dumb. At least make it realistic. The Angels fly in one point of the movie. Roger Ebert said that Not much is going on in these pretty little heads. Actually, that's what's happening with the film writers.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
50,Angelus2,Still a good action flick....,7,13 June 2008,"This film has an array of cameo's from famous stars, Bruce Willis; Owen Wilson to name only two. It seems to me the Director took the whole 'Popcorn' film too seriously and tried to provide an epic adventure, with bigger effects and fight scenes. The film in my eyes was much based on substance...yes the first film had a weak plot but it was a fun movie.This film has scenes which made me cringe at moments...i.e. 'Bernie Mac'...I loved him in Ocean's Eleven and watched the Bernie Mac show; but it just seemed he was out of place...Still a good movie though...",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
51,lambiepie-2,Little Boys (and older men who act like little boys) Cotton Candy.,1,29 June 2003,"Let me be truthful. I wasn't a big Charlie's Angeles fan on TV.
I didn't like the first movie one, and if it wasn't for my group of friends (male and female) who wanted to check this movie out tonight, I wouldn't have seen this one either. The only reason why I agreed was I wanted to see Demi Moore, I did all two and a half seconds of her (joking) and big friggin' whoopty-doo.I wrote a host of other reviews on IMdB for other films before doing this one, that's how much I think of this film. But ya know what, this film is not made for me. It's made to give young guys, and older guys who wont admit they're older, a rise. This is all for them..just like the TV show, just like the boring movie before it.I wont lie here, it has all the ""right"" elements..a driving movie score, major MTV type cuts and lots of T &A and round-about adolescent sex ""snicker-snicker..giggle, giggle...nudge-nudge"" jokes for that little boy crowd. Sophomoric.Just like in the 70's, I am already tired of seeing these ""women"" roll out their bag of bones around under the pretense that that's what makes an action, smart woman. I guess McG thinks so and so does Drew Barrymore. I saw nothing special in any of these women as Charlie's undercover law ladies and maybe that's a good thing for me considering this/these films were not made for me. I just want more out of my female action stars. (Gosh I miss the character Ripley in the Alien/Aliens films about now, don't you?)Who cares who plays Bosley, by the way. You could stick Jimmy Hoffa in the roll and who'd care? It's not important. What is is the testosterone driven score, with the slick boney ladies T&A pulsating, flipping, twirling, looking oh so sexy to titilate their target market. And how they portray the men..its down right discrimination but WHO CARES!!! Guys aren't there for this anyway.If you're a young teen boy, or an older guy trying to be a young teen boy, this sequel is for you. You'll enjoy it and think its the most spectacular movie of the summer.Girls/Women on the average (not all mind you) may not be as enthusiastic aboout it unless they want to ""immulate"" these creatures and if they do, then that's all the filmmakers wanted to achieve in the first place. Me, I hope this is the last of this but because the dollar is mightier than the talent, I know it wont be.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
52,PatrynXX,Series needs a new director. Big time!!!,4,22 January 2004,"(spoilers?)about 95% of this movie doesn't make sense.  Hence it becomes boring.  It's perhaps the only action movie I've ever seen that came out boring.  It's amazing that a sequel made it.  It makes League of Extrordiary Gentlemen look pretty darn good. Although this movie is a bit more fun to watch that the stupid first movie.  Full Throttle doesn't improve on the formula.  And as Demi says.  Angel's used to carry guns.  Hope those girls get the clue to do just that.And what up with Demi in this movie?  It was said to be her comeback.  You don't make a comeback when your character is hardly in the movie.
I wish Drew would make more movies like Ever After.  It's been going down ever since.  And I really like her so it's disappointing seeing this film.4/10Quality: 3/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 6/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

These movies aren't meant to win awards or be realsitic, they are more about having fun and boy did Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle entertain me for two hours. The angels Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all come back to their roles eager and welcome and all three are just as much fun to watch as they were in thr first one. The chemistry between the three is some of the strongest I've ever seen for a trio of women since The Heroic Trio in an action film involing women. Bernie Mac as Bosley steals every scene he's in and it looks like he had tons of fun working on the movie also. I hope they bring him back for the thrid movie. McG is a good action director and sure sometimes the action sequences are unbeliveable but to me it was all part of the fun. Demi Moore was good in her villian role even though she ahd limtied screen time and the always good Crispin Glover is down right creepy as The Thin Man.

54,vip_ebriega,"Big, dumb but a lot fun just the same.",6,12 May 2008,"My Take: Fast and fun, just not as good as the first. CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE, the sequel to the surprise hit CHARLIE'S ANGELS (itself, a follow-up than a remake of the classic TV series), is just much like the first film, with style flowing over substance. The plot is empty and the film's just stylish action scenes, incomplete without the famous slow-motion shots. But it's a lot of fun, and it also seemed that it took as much fun to make it. It's enjoyably pleasant enough, even if it's dumber than usual.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are back for more serious, sexy spyin' as Angels Natalie, Dylan and Alex, on a mission to stop the usual bad guys, while also trying to fix things with their everyday lives. Natalie is still on a long-time relationship with her boyfriend (Luke Wilson) and wondering if ever he is going to propose. On the other hand, Alex's father (John Cleese) has just returned home and discovers that her daughter's career is far beyond what he was made to believe (she was supposed to be a doctor). Dylan on the other hand confronts his ex-boyfriend who she discovers to be a hit-man, now working for the bad guys. Supporting roles are provided by Demi Moore (as an ex-Angel), Crispin Glover (back as the bizarre ""Thin Man"") and Bernie Mac (as the Angels' new sidekick replacing Bill Murray from the original). Also watch for a cameo appearances by Bruce Willis and Carrie Fisher.Director McG gives the film a MTV-feel, some of which is pretty stylish, some of which are just plain dumb and silly. The script, although has a number of clever comedy bits, is just a retread of the first film, and using leftovers from the original. There's nothing really new about this sequel, but what else is new? Sequels to summer movies tend to be dumb, derivative and repetitive, but few are actually real fun ones. FULL THROTTLE is not fun for more than the run time, but it's enjoyable for most of the time. Stars Diaz, Barrymore and Liu are having a ball-clowning with their roles, having just as much fun as in the first film.FULL THROTTLE is not for everyone's taste. Those who can't take silliness and dumbness for an hour's worth of running time may not make until the end. But those who can suspend their disbelief for the sake of one silly dose of summer madness, CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE delivers exactly what its expected from it.Rating: *** out of 5.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
55,carbuff,"Really, really dumb, but really, really fun.",9,3 May 2015,"God help me, but I loved this. It's stupid and ridiculous. It's trashy, squishy, soft-soft-core porn. But it's got fluorescent and pastel colors. It's got 80s and 90s music. It's got cool machines. It's got over-the-top unreal stunts. This is about as far as you can get from high-minded culture short of films rated with triple letters, but it's a great guilty pleasure for me since I grew up watching bad TV in the 70s. The recipe is basic, but a hell of a lot more satisfying than meatloaf. Take yourself some stale old TV schlock like ""Charlie's Angels"", pour in a few zillion dollars, stir and simmer for an hour and 45 minutes, and out comes a tasty confection of pure negative-calorie, big- screen idiocy. This is a truly sincerely positive review, although you've got to be able to really power your brain down to enjoy this sort of extreme mindlessness, something nobody has ever said I have a problem doing. Maybe some of that zen or om or whatever crap from the 70s or 80s or whenever might put you in the mood. Sure you'd feel queasy if you watched too much stuff like this, but then I hope you'd never be dumb enough to try subsisting on nothing but Cheetos either. Producing this movie was an utterly indefensible waste of sorely-needed, invaluable, declining resources unjustifiably extracted from an impoverished planet careening towards global ecological collapse, but since it's neither fattening or highly addictive, I'll let it slide. I suspect that subjecting yourself to this cheese overdose may be positively correlated with early-onset dementia, but that's a risk I deem worth taking. Really, I'm not being facetious. I got a kick out of this movie. It's legal and doesn't burn a hole in your nose or give you the munchies. You can even drive a car after consuming it, although I probably wouldn't. The other side of the coin is that if you absolutely insist on thinking, it might be impossible to do worse than this film.

OMG I love these movies. Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is super dope! Way better than even the 1st 1. Way hotter too omg. Is it getting hot in here? Cameron as Natalie is silly hot. Isn't it kinda warm? Lucy as Alex is super hot. It's getting heated. I swear I'm sweating. Drew as Dylan is rocking hot. Ok it's seriously burning up in here. Did somebody just turn up the temperature? I'm literally on fire. I love everything about this movie. EVERYTHING! The music is super dope and the action is too. Full Throttle is my #1 favorite movie of all-time. Just ahead of Braveheart and Forrest Gump. I seriously love how awesomely super crazy sexy it is. Like nonstop. Drew and Cameron and Lucy are super cute together. OMG. I love it when the Angels smile or laugh or kid or be cute or be serious or check out a hot guy. Lucy Drew and Cameron are all glowy in Charlie's Angels like the Angels have a visible aura. It's setting my balls on fire. There are about 600 million crazy sexy moments I love from this movie so I couldn't possibly list them all here but here are just a few of my favorite hot moments - the zooming in Angel introductions in the Northern Mongolian mountain tavern at the very beginning with Natalie's mechanical bull ride (uh yyes) - Alex's gymnastic montage (Lucy in pigtails and a leotard yaay!) - Hammer Time with the 3 girls dancing clothed with a couch (super hot) - surfing at the beach with Madison Lee in black and Natalie Cook in white bikinis (cooool, really really cool) - Helen Zaas tongue wrestling Seamus O'Grady (ass-tonishing) - the Treasure Chest burlesque show (in the history of hotness has there ever been anything hotter, no, oh god) - the Angels cracking out of their angels sculpture nude and ready for action (shadowy and sweet) - Natalie going to the little boys room and dancing in her prom dress with Pete (yes! yes! yes! yes!) - Madison aiming her gun in her big ol' fur and itty bitty lingerie (holy smoking hot Demi Moore) - the Angels washing cars at the car wash post credits (me likey me want more please) - in complete secession.

57,fernandoschiavi,"The effects are often not as good as expected, the action over and the easy and absurd solutions for the plot undermine any credibility",5,4 April 2021,"While not unanimity, but due to its good grossing antecessor hits theaters, three years after the adventure of the first film, the sequel to Charlie's Angels. With the subtitle ""Full Throttle"", the screenplay by John August and Cormac and Marianne Wibberley, brings the detective Natalie, Alex and Dylan, again in the service of Charles Townsend Detective Agency, investigating a series of murders that occur after a file system witness protection to be stolen from the U. S. government. Million dollars richer, the leading trio back to jump, hit and star more fights that defy logic. The plot begins with scenes short of totally absurd as to their veracity, in Mongolia, where the Panthers have to rescue an American politician (Robert Patrick), captured by mercenaries for being in possession of a ring. Soon it is revealed that such a ring is part of a database that provides access to the witness protection program of the Government. But to access the information, you must attach it to another, who is Secretary William Rose Bailey (Bruce Willis), who makes a brief role in the film. The main suspect of having committed theft and murder is Madison Lee (Demi Moore), a former Panther who left the agency a while ago to enter the world of crime. The Panthers will then need to act so that the ring does not fall into the wrong hands.Just as before, we start with a long sequence shot where we are shown the place, a sort of tavern in Mongolia, where the Panthers rescue an American politician among many improbable twists and an escape but well thought no credibility whatsoever. Shortly after this scene, we have re-opened when the Panthers appear on scenes from his past and present, highlighting the features of each of them: the bumbling, super smart and winning and rebel without limits. After that in fact the story unfolds with the purest base action.The chemistry between Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore (again producing the franchise) is evident, but the big problem is that the second film will empower all wildly. Are many (almost all) the scenes in which we look, think and speak: ""Wow, that's a lie."" And this is just the beginning, because later we see the girls hanging from buildings with one hand, and (three at the same time) dragged by a convertible in full a movie premiere in Hollywood. Not to mention the shot in the chest and fall of a very high place and nothing happens, the explosion that occurs a few meters but virtually nothing reaches our heroines juggling atop a chair, among numerous other scenes forced high and the tenth power . The trail involving a helicopter and a truck, is the largest of all the lies of the film.The plot does not include the characters, the case in which the story is made to work the characters and not the opposite. Here is a case where the text is done completely to pack the action scenes, choreographed fights for and that players may leave the audience ecstatic to see their perfect curves closes with well-planned hips, breasts and faces. Some passages that stand out are the scene where Cameron appears early in the movie riding on a mechanical bull, and when the trio comes in sensual dance on stage to the music of ""pink panther pink"". The three, while appearing lingerie and sensually dancing are a treat for the eyes, with special emphasis on Lucy Liu that is irresistible in that particular scene. But this time, in addition to Drew, Lucy and Cameron, have the presence of the always lovely Demi Moore, that no longer appeared on the big screen, and is as sensational as the other girls.The cameos continue. Besides John Forsythe who lends his voice to the enigmatic Charlie for the second time in the cinema, Justin Theroux appears as an ex-boyfriend Dylan who wants revenge for her having it reported to the police. Robert Patrick, the eternal T-1000 Terminator 2: Judgment Day, as an American politician. Luke Wilson reprising his role as Pete, this film taking an important step in her relationship with Alex. Matt LeBlanc as Jason back and carries double meaning of hilarious scenes with John Cleese who plays Alex's father, Mr. Munday. And yet we see emerging in a big production movie, young and hairy Shia LaBeouf as Max, the star that would shine four years later as Sam in the Transformers franchise, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and the movie Disturbia. Of course we cannot forget to mention the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro in his first role in Hollywood. Even without speaking a single sentence and just having your body in the scenes shown in the surfer who played grumpy Ememrs was kick him in American cinema, and he has been able to mend some work abroad after such participation. This time the producers got a share of one of Lightning Angels Jaclyn Smith, Kelly Garrett in the television series. Sisters Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are also less than 10 seconds on screen. Bill Murray is the one who has not appeared in the sequel, just in photography, especially by disagreements with Lucy Liu in the first film, being replaced by the late comedian Bernie Mac as the new Bosley.For other references, this time we see allusions to current classic or not, as The Sound of Music, Flashdance, Mission: Impossible 2, Singing in the Rain, The Matrix, Spider-Man. But various defects should be highlighted. There are too many supporting characters, as all cited in the previous paragraph. For each, there are sub-plots and this damages the depth of the characters and we get the distinct impression of being underutilized, especially Bruce Willis.A quick edit, but using camera features slow Wayne Wahrman was efficient, as well as music composed by Edward Shearmur again. The photography Russell Carpenter is also a highlight of the film.The film's director McG has a balance in the overall context, but eventually defects protruding. The effects are often not as good as expected, the wild action and story without depth and arranging easy solutions and absurd further undermine any credibility. However, like the first, the film is assumed not to be taken seriously, but more exaggerated than before. The original is a little better, but some real laughs are uprooted and entertain the audience with humor even not being the same as before. If you do not have anything better to rent, worth checking out, especially by female beauties that have even greater prominence in every way.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
58,Rogue-32,Nothing' like good ol' fashioned team spirit,7,30 June 2003,"I loved the first ""Charlie's Angels"" movie - it was pure escapist, eye-candy fun - and guess what?! The second one is even better (even without Tim Curry, which I never thought I'd say). Great energy level, maintained throughout, thanks to a change in Bosleys -- Bill Murray stuck out like a sore thumb in the first one but Bernie Mac picks up the slack seamlessly. The Angels are in top form, and Demi Moore as the Angel-gone-bad doesn't hurt neither. Crispin Glover adds his usual psychotic appeal to the proceedings, and when it was over I wished I was at home instead of in a movie theatre so I could hit rewind and watch it all over again.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
59,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,As cheesy as cheese gets...,4,21 September 2004,"Oh dear.....This movie was one over the top cheesy stunt/joke/scene/whatever to the next. From the over the top cheesy crazy opening to the insane and cheesy end. Ditzy and plastic one liners at every possible moment and that make up! It just won't come off!Also in the insane comic book cliché finale the angels turn into clones on Spider-man and sling onto a moving car with the help of wires! Sounds cool but it is really pathetic and hopefully the end of this sorry series. The Matrix effects were also bad. I guess the only thing good here would be the cast. Plenty of stars, including in cameos, but that's it.Oh, and would jumping from a ten foot ledge, doing a somersault in mid-air, with high-heels hurt? Demi seems to disagree.

60,FilmOtaku,Nothing more than a long music video - but is that so bad?,5,3 July 2003,"This movie proved that I may finally be growing up.  Or, I was feeling particularly solicitous.  Either way, I will admit that I was very entertained by this movie.  I went to see it with someone who had every intention of watching it for the sole purpose of ripping on it, but that ended up not happening for two reasons:  I really enjoyed watching it, and it was WAY too loud to actually speak to someone during the action sequences, which essentially comprise about 90 percent of the movie.This movie is nothing more than an action filled music video that showcases stupid humor in the same vein as Three's Company.  However, the reason why Three's Company was (and still is) so successful is that the writers recognized their cheese and sleaze factor and therefore delivered their product with a self-deprecating wink.  The same idea was apparent during this movie, which can allow the viewer to not only groan at the jokes, but laugh as well.  My only complaint about the film is that there wasn't enough Crispin Glover.  Truthfully, he was the only part of the movie that actually got me to see it, however I'll forgive them this time since the rest of the film was so entertaining.So suspend all disbelief, understand that everything in the film was done with tongue firmly planted in cheek and just enjoy the action unfold.  These are extremely mature words for someone like me who normally doesn't approve of a film unless I have been wrenched through the emotional roller a few times and can count the number of comedies in her DVD collection on one hand, so these are high words of praise.--Shelly",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

If you end up watching this, you will probably be like me in saying that it starts off great then gradually begins to suck. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic, an eye-popping cinematic treat. I would suggest renting it, or perhaps buying it if the price is right. All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world.

When the angels land perfectly on the rope of the ship after escaping Seamus, they glide down. At this moment, two teenage guys in front of me laughed and said, ""Yeah, right."" They didn't get it. This movie doesn't pretend to be logical. It is spoofing big budget Hollywood movies such as Mission Impossible 2, which is ripe for being made fun of. The entire movie is best summed up by Drew Barrymore's Dylan when she is searching in Alan Caulfield home when she recognizes that the killer was wearing a limited edition shoe only sold at one footlocker in New Jersey in 2002. There is no way that anyone would know this, but the point is just that. I wish it was as fun as the original though. The movie references feel forced.

You see, I just saw Charlie's Angels, Full Throttle.Everything about this movie looks good. The cast, the scenery, the action... It's just all so loud, so massive, so long. It feels like you're in a rollercoaster that goes on for over an hour and a half, without ever slowing down. There must be like a hundred songs on the soundtrack, including complete albums by the Prodigy.The movie completely relies on its three leading ladies, and 2 of them really pull it of. Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz are perfectly cast in their roles, but somehow you feel Drew Barrymore doesn't fit in it. She doesn't add anything to the trio, if you'd ask me.As there are other weak points. They replaced the great Bill Murray for some annoying unknown comedian (who keeps on making black & white jokes, how old is that?), plus it's obvious Demi Moore completely forgot her acting lessons in this one.

And I suspect, that was the main goal of the whole process.The angels are the same, Barrymore, Liu and Diaz, only Boslye has changed from Murray to Bernie Mac. The plot line this time has a fallen angel snuffing people in witness protection. That must be stopped.The formula hasn't changed, the things are just turbo boosted. The girls are still sexy and Demi Moore is in the mix just to add this a bit more mature, yet still hot babe, element into the mix.If the producers want to make yet third incarnation to the series I would recommend entirely different road, as from this film the next step is that the angels become superheroes.It's okay as just to pass some time, but just like the first one multiple viewings are closed out for this film.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The writing was interesting, revealing new facts about some of the characters.  One standout performance is from Crispin Glover, whose return as the Creepy Thin Man takes on some surprising new turns.  And while Bernie Mac does put in a good performance in his own way, I'm afraid he doesn't really replace Bill Murray as Bosley.

Half-way between Austin Powers and Scooby-Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed, this film acts as if it's the sequel reboot to a beloved franchise despite only being the second entry to a pretty poorly received one. Full Throttle, I imagine is how much the entire cast and creative team decided to lean in to the gonzo, incomprehensible and incongruous bunk of the first film.
Full Tilt might be more accurate and everything, and I mean everything is dialled up to 11.
One thing to say about this film and its predecessor is that it's strange in this landscape to see strong, independent female characters that are whimsical, feminine, clearly having fun, and also strong and kick-ass without being so self serious or sardonic. It's nice.
Also this film has The Beef in it. Even Stevens era. The best kind.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

72,supertom-3,"Pure badness, the sexy ladies can't even make up for this pap!!",1,18 July 2003,"Okay initially I liked the first one, it was infectious, the world that the Angels lived in was nuts and the three gorgeous actors were charming and sweet, as well as the film having some decent action and a vibrant energy. There was a certain enjoyable charm about it.While trying to up the ante they lose any magic from the first, and Bill Murrey is sadly lacking. The charm of Rockwell as the bad guy is also missing. The first was all about blatant movie making excess, in terms of style and female flesh, it was all aimed at trying to sell at both teenage boys (with the three sexy ladies wearing tight outfits) and teenage girls (indestructible ass kicking females) but this sequel overdoes it and results in the audience getting a head ache.The action is far too stylised and is ridiculous. The film bursts into film reference, dance sequences, comic flashbacks, twice as much and inopportune as the first film. Basically put, the film is nuts, the way its set out is just weird. The film has its moments, with some references to certain films, but the structure of this film is all over the place, and some of the action does not work.The cast are good. Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are very sexy and kick bum well and Cameron Diaz is just adorable, they nearly have the charm to save this movie from being totally unwatchable. John Cleese is underused and Bernie Mac has somehow turned unfunny. Also back on the big screen for the first time since her disaster Striptease is Demi Moore and at 40 boy oh boy does she look good (500,000 dollars well spent by all accounts), she looks great, she's in fantastic shape and despite having them reduced has a fantastic rack, unfortunately her performance is wooden and she doesn't seem all there, she does however get to kill Bruce Willis in a pretty funny cameo from him.To be honest I won't watch this overly flashy music video again unless its on TV and I'm bored and want a boner. Avoid, the only recommendation is the booty factor but to be honest it is all so blatant you may as well watch Baywatch. Give me Jennifer Connelly's gorgeous green eyes ahead of this any day. *",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

So what did they do? They squandered it all with a sequel where they just assumed they could put just about anything out, and people would continue to go see it. Except the public isn't that stupid. Putting them in hot outfits and thinking you could get away with a ridiculous plot line, silly dialogue, and smug acting was arrogant beyond belief. I remember at the time when the bad reviews came out, Lucy Liu said something like, ""I really don't care if people aren't happy with what we did.""

74,christian123,My Guilty Pleasure Of The Week,4,2 June 2005,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle may not be an Oscar quality film but I enjoyed it and its really a guilty pleasure of mine. The Angels--Natalie, Dylan, and Alex--prepare to strike without warning as they go undercover to retrieve two missing silver bands. These are no ordinary rings. They contain valuable encrypted information that reveal the new identities of every person in the Federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses start turning up dead, only the Angels, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts can stop the perpetrator, a mysterious ""fallen"" Angel. The plot sounds cheesy which isn't a bad thing as the TV show was cheesy as well. I think the execution is a little disappointing though as the film didn't really make a lot sense. It was pretty much action sequences followed by one another. The action sequences were pretty good but they were tied together with a thin plot. Most of the cast returns with a few new additions. Drew Barrymore played Dylan and she did a good job. Cameron Diaz also did a good job and seemed to really be enjoying herself. Lucy Liu does a good job as well and this film works a lot better thanks to these three actresses. Bill Murray is out and he is replaced by Bernie Mac. Mac does an okay job though he does get a little annoying sometimes. Demi Moore returns as the fallen angel. She plays her role well an she also looks great. Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, John Cleese and Crispin Glover all appear and all have minor roles. I was a bit confused to see Crispin Glover as I'm pretty sure he died in the first one but its Hollywood and anything goes. Shia LaBeouf is only the film for a little bit yet he is annoying every time he is on screen. Also what happens in the end with him is incredibly stupid even for this film. McG directs and does kind of a messy job. Most people will probably hate this film while others will view it as a so bad its good type of film. I'm more with the latter as I did enjoy this film. Yes, the dialog was lame and the story didn't really make sense but if you can look past those then you should be able to enjoy this sequel. Is this one better then the original? No, the original was more fun to watch and it had Bill Murray. In the end, this film isn't really worth watching but if your looking for something you can just shut your brain off and enjoy then this film might fit the bill. Rating 7/10, not the best film of 2003 but you could do a lot worse.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
75,Silverzero,"Vain, mega-budget popcorn entertainment at its most exuberant.",10,18 July 2003,"I must admit that I have not yet seen the predecessor to `Full Throttle'. But I know that the reviews were very hit-and-miss. The action genre isn't always my favourite type of movie, but I do like the action-chick-flicks. `Tomb Raider' and `The Long Kiss Goodnight' are two such movies that spring to mind. And so continues the transition of the campy 70's TV show to the silver screen. In short, if you want a good action movie, then this is the film for you.Not only that, it is actually quite funny for the most. You might think that the continual sexual innuendo/ double entendres would wear thin after a while, but they remain consistently funny (Boy, it was really pumping me out there. I'm gonna be wet for hours!). That said, this is humour at its cheesiest. Few films take themselves less seriously than this. While there are some sub-plots thrown in here and there, the film is really only a bit of gas. As an equation, this is style over substance, but that's not to say that it isn't a refreshing hour and a half.And the movie generates most of its energy from the enthusiasm of the performances. The `Angels' are all on top-form and are perfectly suited to their roles. Their undercover scenes are quite funny too. Usually in these similarly themed movies, the villain is highly un-memorable. But Demi Moore's fallen `Angel' Madison Lee is one of the best villains in a while. She may be 40, but she is also super-sexy, convincing, and it's good to see her return to the big screen. The other baddie, played by Justin Theroux, is the exact stereotype I mentioned earlier. Matt LeBlanc (more like Matt lePlank) does his `Joey' routine again, but certainly doesn't prove to be any more than, er, Joey. Then there are good (if not irrelevant) cameos from Bruce Willis, Carrie Fisher and Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen. Bernie Mac (Ocean's Eleven) replaces Bill Murray's original Bosley role. I thought he was well suited for the part, but it doesn't make sense why a white man would have an all black family! The exact same applies to John Cleese as Lucy Liu's dad. He's funny, but why would an Englishman have an Asian daughter? The mind boggles.Another good point is the soundtrack. It is filled with loads of cool songs that bring the film style and an upbeat sense of itself. The plot is certainly the weakest point. It forms a bare skeleton for the film to stick to. The story of a list of people using the Witness Protection Programme certainly isn't what `Charlie's Angels' will be remembered for. Action sequences and CG are expected to be perfect in today's high-tech world, thus, all visual points are well choreographed and conceived.
A good high-octane summer blockbuster, `Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' is good guilty fun. It's not `The Godfather', but it isn't brainless and inept either. If you want good popcorn entertainment `Charlie's Angels' is worth a look. My IMDb rating: 6.9/10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
76,shanfloyd,"Promised much, but turned out to be trash in the end.",5,1 August 2003,"I went to see this movie being attracted simply by a trailer I saw four months ago featuring the scene on the bridge in Mongolia. I became quite disappointed in the end. I did not expect this detoriation at all. The first movie was bad, I admit. But still that had some story at least. This one is simply a piece of trash. There are a few good action sequences and that's all... except you count a ""new-and-improved"" Demi Moore as a plus point.Being an executive producer perhaps meant to Drew Barrymore that she deserves something more. So she did less stunts but gained more attention from MCG. She was, to tell the truth, not in a position or shape to be cast as an Angel anymore. Lucy Liu ultimately saved this one as usual. Cameron Diaz is not even half as she used to be. Matt LeBlanc proved his expertise again in a short role.A large number of sequels are being released this summer. Most of them are being proved to be disappointing... due to lack of deep plot. T3 and Matrix: Reloaded survived, only due to this cause. Get at least a decent story, otherwise it's all failure. 4/10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
77,jpintar,Mediocore,5,26 October 2003,Neither Charlie's Angel movie is very good.  It takes three good actresses and puts them through lame action scenes and thin plot.  Both movies are directed by the obnoxious McG (think Quentin Tarantino with no talent) and have phony looking special effects.  This one hits a low by casting the non actress Demi Moore as the villain (whose appearance is actually brief). Coming Attractions basically give away the whole movie.  Watchable but overlong and deserved its fate at the boxoffice.,Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
78,Stompgal_87,Even better than the original and one of the best live-action films of the last decade,10,11 April 2014,"Having already enjoyed the breathtaking original, I wanted to see this sequel as soon as it was publicised. I saw this at the cinema with a family aide (a person who takes disabled and autistic people on 1:1 outings to give their families a break) and when she asked me what I'd thought of it when it finished, I found it better than the first. Not only was it as funny, silly and action-packed as the original but also I got to learn more about some of the characters through their back stories, particularly Dylan and the Thin Man, who I thought had died in an explosion in the original.While a reviewer for the Radio Times gave this film one star and said it had no plot, I figured that there is a main plot; that involving the Angels trying to retrieve two titanium rings from two members of the Witness Protection Agency. The plot was as gripping and engaging as that of the original. While the first half of this one is the funniest, the second half has the most action-filled scenes with as much hard work put in the stunts as the original and a touch of heartache when Dylan temporarily leaves the Angels and heads for Mexico where she receives guidance from Kelly Garrett, one of the Angels from the original mid 1970s - early 1980s television series. Throughout the film, I also enjoyed spotting references to the previous film such as Natalie saying she loved tickets and later pulling down her Spider-Man pants in the boys' toilets at Pete's school reunion, Jason mentioning his initial thought of Alex being a bikini waxer and the photograph of the Angels on the beach, first seen when Dylan temporarily leaves the agency. I also liked some of the plot twists, especially Pete looking as if he is going to propose to Natalie but instead announces he bought them both a puppy named Spike (as shown on the dog tag in the box). The soundtrack here is a bit better than that in the first. While the incidental music was composed in a similar manner to that in the original, there were four recognisable instrumental pieces (the piece of classical music played during Alex's brief chess scene, the 'Pulp Fiction' theme, The Lonely Goatherd' from 'The Sound of Music' during the convent scene and the Pink Panther music played during the raunchy dance scene at the Treasure Chest) and a great mix of songs such as MC Hamner's 'U Can't Touch This,' Pink's 'Feel Good Time (this film's main song),' Bon Jovi's 'Livin' On A Prayer,' the Prodigy's 'Breathe' and 'Firestarter (which cleverly accompanied the flame-throwing scene and may have been an allusion to one of Drew Barrymore's childhood films) and 'A Girl Like You' by Edwyn Collins.' The Angels were as excellent as in the original with Natalie being funnier than she was in the original, Jason and Pete made welcoming returns while the new Bosley, played comically by the late Bernie Mac, Dylan's old flame Seamus O'Grady and fallen Angel Madison Lee were worthy new characters. There were also some decent cameos from Pink, the Olsen Twins and Jaclyn Smith.Overall this superb girlie action comedy was well worth the watch, much better than the original and undoubtedly the best live-action film to come out in the last decade alongside the first two Harry Potter films. 10/10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
79,Darkest_Rose,Boring...,5,28 June 2003,"Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are back as Charlie's Angels which seems to only attract older perverted men.

There is some kind of villain and the angels kick his(or should I say her?)ass, blah, blah, blah, the movie is predictable, the action scenes are rather boring then exciting, the only thing that saves them is the music. I did though enjoy Demi Moore's short yet sweet performance as the dark angel. Overall I thought this movie was boring and I did not have a fun time like I thought I would have.

81,rparham,Weightless entertainment,6,2 July 2003,"Of all the big summer sequels of 2003, Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle seemed the safest bet for a good time at the movies.  The 2000 original was a TV remake that had a good-natured sense of it's own silliness and decided to not try on the serious modern updating of other TV remakes (Lost in Space especially comes to mind).  Yes, it was ridiculous, but it knew it was and didn't shy away from it.  So, three years later, the same trio of superstar women (Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu) have re-upped for another round of high-octane camp.  However, this time, much of the same formula applied to the first just doesn't work.To call Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle plotless would be kind.  It is a mish-mash of action set-pieces strung together by the thinest of story. What little that is decipherable is as follows:  The Angels are recruited to recover two stolen rings know as HALO that contain the contents of the witness protection agency's entire roster of protectees, which is being placed on the market to go to the highest bidder by former-Angel Madison Lee (Demi Moore).  Along the way, an ex-beau of current Angel Dylan Sanders (Barrymore), Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux), one of the competing bidders, has decided he wants revenge on his former companion, who turned him into the authorities a decade earlier after witnessing him commit a murder.There is nothing necessarily wrong with a movie that just wants to have fun, but Full Throttle has taken it to such an extreme that all the enjoyment has been sapped from the experience.  The action scenes aren't just overblown, they are flat out inane in their level of suspension of disbelief.  One after another, the outrageousness keeps on coming until your brain can't process any more.  Many other films have featured unbelievable action sequences, but Full Throttle pushes it to the limit and then blatantly crosses it by about a mile.All that would be forgivable if the film had any weight to it whatsoever. The characters are all just thinly drawn caricatures, generic superwomen who can do anything at a moment's notice without any concern for safety.  The film doesn't allow the characters to develop into believable people in even the slightest, and by continually placing them in dangerous situations which they waltz out of with a wink and a smile, the film robs itself of any lasting impact.  The action pours on, but since we know that the characters are incapable of being injured seriously or killed, we have no involvement in the film.  It's just empty eye-candy, passing in front of our face.It doesn't help that director McG has decided to outdo fellow former commercial director Michael Bay (who also has a super-action picture due this summer, Bad Boys II).  The film is so driven by flashy editing and elaborate camera moves that you can barely ever get your bearings during the film, not to mention the pulsing soundtrack (which, admittedly, is not as annoying as in some other films of the same type).Does this mean Full Throttle is a total loss?  Not really.  It has it's entertaining moments, especially those provided by Bernie Mac, playing the Angels immediate supervisor/assistant, Bosley.  His one liners are fairly entertaining most of the time, but John Cleese steals the show with his short cameo as Angel Alex Munday's (Liu) father.  The best showing in the film is offered up by Demi Moore.  Out of the spotlight for several years after a string of bombs and a tumultuous personal life that was splashed all over the tabloids, Moore carries herself well and provides the meatiest acting of the whole film. Matt LeBlanc and Luke Wilson have token walk-ons reprising roles from the original, and are pretty much wasted.  The film also contains numerous brief appearances by many other super-stars, but most of them are in the vein of ""Oh, there's so-in-so.""  They add little to the proceedings.Is Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle really a bad film?  No, not really. Something this harmless could not really be classified as bad.  And at times it occasionally works.  But the whole combination is so lacking, that Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is just like a decent meal at a fast food restaurant:  yeah, it'll fill you up, but you wont remember it much not long after eating it.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

83,ilovedolby,The only butt-kicking action you'll get is the one you give yourself for paying admission to see this nonsense.,6,1 July 2003,"When you think of a film like `Charlie's Angels,' generally you think of something as a guilty pleasure. However, its sequel, `Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' is anything but pleasurable. In fact, it's really a corporate sequel in which the execs as Columbia just want to keep the cash rolling in to create a franchise. The film does this by putting uncredited celebrities in the film, rehashing old jokes, using an old plot sequence, and having the actors mock scenes from movies of previous years. The end result is an annoying blend of non-stop action sequences, loud music and performances that just seem to dumb down the talents of three really good actresses.`Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' teams up Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu as the sizzling spies on another mission. Things are a bit different this time; their new team leader, Jimmy Bosley (Bernie Mac) keeps the angels in touch with the Charlie. Incidentally, Jimmy is the cousin of John Bosley who was played by Bill Murray in the first film. In this new mission, the angels are sent to find two rings that hold information on the identities of people under witness protection. But the catch is that someone in the government may have actually been the person who stole the rings and may also be a mole for whomever the enemy may be. `Full Throttle' brings in some old stars to add a little spice to the film, although the taste could be described as bitter. Demi Moore stars as Madison, a former angel who appears to be the leader in the plot to steal the rings. Moore lacks anything that could possibly be impressive for the film. At best, she's a fair actress and at first sight an audience member may assume that she's the mother of one of the angels. What's more, there are a lot of celebrity cameos in the film-a technique that just reaches for attention when the film doesn't deserve any to begin with. Look for Bruce Willis, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen and Pink along with small roles by John Cleese, Robert Patrick and newcomer Shia LaBeouf (`Holes').Here's the first big problem-the plot is exactly that of `Mission: Impossible,' only moronic. It just proves that there isn't an original idea in Hollywood and there is no incentive to come up with one when you can make exorbitant amounts of money on simple stuff like `Full Throttle.' Also, the film mocks several movies of late including `Raider of the Lost Ark,' `City Slickers' and `Mission: Impossible 2.' Perhaps `Full Throttle' is trying to be a parody of the action of films that many people love, but at the same time, I don't think anyone cares. Another problem is the humor-it's tired and predictable. In fact, the movie becomes annoying after the first half-hour from its sexual insinuations and poor one-liners. Bernie Mac doesn't even come off as all that witty when he should really be something that grabs the attention of the audience. The only thing that was actually worth laughing about was Crispin Glover (`Willard') as he reprises his role as the Creepy Thin Guy. It's hysterical to watch the unusual character as he doesn't say anything, but does try to indulge his hair fetish by stealing some of the angel's hair and screaming as he does it. Glover has that ability to be weird, yet completely amusing.The bottom line with `Full Throttle' is that the only butt-kicking action you'll get is the one you give yourself for paying admission to see this nonsense. **",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
84,patrick_dunne,"It's pretty bad, but not unwatchable. You can be doing something better with 106 minutes of your life,",2,11 February 2006,"Take three girls who are pretty, strong smart, and all-around perfect, and put them in a situation where they fight off millions of baddies or any other impossible situation, with added stunts and slow-motion scenes. This is the basic formula for ""Charlie's Angel's: Full Throttle,"" the sequel to ""Charlie's Angels."" Three spies called ""Charlie's Angels"" (Hence the name of the movie.) begin their movie by saving a male hostage who drops his ""wedding ring"" while being saved. When the spies return to Charlie's office, a predictable moment sets in; the ring was for a more important purpose then a wedding. It was a dangerous HALO ring which is dangerous if not recovered.I found this part to be very predictable, because the line where the man explains about his wedding ring seemed to stick out from the crowd of dialogue. I knew this concept in Kindergarten, and kind of made up a story for the formula:A group of people are walking on a path. They find a machine that they don't think works. The, the machine does something useful at the end. It's the one-twist kind of story line, which makes a twist out of something seemingly unnoticeable. My story seems a bit like this part. The group of people are the angels. The machine is the ring. The ending of my story is the only one that differs, because the machine starts a story in ""Charlie's Angels,"" instead of ending it.The story continues when the three women travel to retrieve the HALO rings. One of the main flaws (and there are many) is that the story line seems to have been made just to include action scenes. I'm not sure what the word is called: episodic, lazy, shallow? Well, it's bad and only made worse due to the fact that the action scenes are really, really bad.In the beginning bike scene, the part where the man turns backwards in mid-air and attempts to shoot the angels looks really goofy. The slow-motion scenes look un-realistic and way too stupid to work. It almost reminded me of ""Belly of the Beast,"" when the guy shoots the arrow with a gun in slow-motion. How ridiculous. I think it's also ridiculous how the women fight off numerous baddies, and other un-realistic stunts, such as jumping onto a helicopter.The music and the way the characters act sometimes give the movie a different feeling to it. For example, at times, the movie more closely resembles a flick for young girls than a spy movie. There are just some scenes that don't seem to fit.Another flaw is that ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" tries to be a goofy comedy, but ends up looking more goofy and ridiculous than an actual comedy. After the opening sequence, the audience is treated to some silly comedy that tones down the level of seriousness.(SOME SPOILERS)Don't forget that the part with ""The Creepy Thin Man"" seemed almost pointless, because he is introduced, but he doesn't do too much. No character development takes place. (END OF SPOILERS)There's actually not much more to it. The script is just a bunch of action sequences and some predictable moments. Then, it's filmed and acted and sent to theatres. I doubt the actresses enjoy their parts, or anything else in this incoherent mess of a movie. ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" isn't so bad that it's unwatchable, but it's 106 minutes long, and with that much time, you can be doing something else with your life, such as homework, chores, or reading. The whole thing is just too ridiculous to actually work. Unless you were a fan of the first one or interested in the dance scene in the middle of the film, there's no real reason to watch this.1.5/10 Good: Plot twists, some OK humor, male audiences may be delighted by the dance scene in the middle Bad: Ridiculous action scenes, perfectionist main characters, pointless introduction, seems too silly to be a spy movie at times, predictable moments, story seems to have been made only to include action sequencesFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
85,Ronin47,What do people not GET about this movie? (***1/2),10,20 October 2003,"""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" is, like the original 2000 film, something of a masterpiece of goofy surrealism.  Say what you will, but the spectacular action scenes in this movie, as well as the comedy and often the ""drama"" are as off-the-wall and flat-out weird as anything in a David Lynch movie.  In particular there is an action scene at a motorcross that obeys the laws of physics in about the same way that ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" does, and by doing so it's one of the most exhilarating action sequences I've seen in a long time.It's also a perfect summer movie.  Funny, fast-paced, exciting, colorful, and with a soundtrack that just won't quit throwing great, classic songs at you, this is a hell of a fun movie.Of course Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu reprise their roles as Nat, Dylan, and Alex, but this time Bernie Mac takes over as Bosley.  As much as I loved Bill Murray in the original, Mac really rocks this role and brings a spin to it that matches the tone of the movie better than Murray did.Like the original, ""Full Throttle"" is thoroughly derivative, but in so many ways that it's completely unique also.  It's like watching your favorite goofball martial-arts movie, going to a beach party, playing a video game, and listening to a great 80's mix tape all at the same time. In other words, it made me feel like a kid again, and there's no higher compliment I could possibly give a movie.  I think I'll leave it at that.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
86,snowfre,A downgrade of a sequel as the film lacks self-awareness,5,17 September 2019,"The first ""Charlie's Angels"" is a surprisingly good comedy movie, combining over-the-top action with spoofy humor. Its sequel ""Full Throttle"" misses most opportunities to do so however and the end result is a slapdash film for which you cannot oversee the thin synopsis due to the lack of parodying atmosphere. The self-awareness of its predecessor is gone with the wind and audiences are left with a messy picture, bad acting, repeating formulas, and horrible action effects. There is one scene in which you can literally see that Lucy Liu is actually a stunt doll. That could've worked in ""Scary Movie 4"" but not in ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"". This isn't much to spend time on as none of the Angels cannot lift the movie to its prequel's best moments at any point.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
87,allar100,"good, no. fun, kinda",5,8 July 2003,"First off, Demi Moore looks really good.  As does Lucy Lui and all of the others.  The ideas behind the HALO rings and Helen Zass is really cool, but the movie is just too over the top to really be worth anything.  I liked Demi Moore as the villian, and I though Shamus O'Grady was pretty cool, but the movie is just way to much at times.  One of the biggest mistakes of the movie is bringing in Bernie Mac to replace Bill Murray, he is just not funny.  I think that he has maybe two good lines.  Anyway, this is a movie that you watch for the scenery, and requiers no intelligence what so ever, so if you are looking for a no brainer, with some great looking women and clever story elements at times, then this is up your alley.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
88,cashbacher,Violating the laws of physics,4,27 February 2020,"This movie features some of the most outrageous ""stunts"" that completely violate the laws of physics. This becomes clear in an early scene when the three angels dive off a dam, beside a helicopter. Before the machine hits the ground, they manage to board it, start it up, get the rotors to speed and then fly away. The tallest dam in the world is 1,000 feet high and the time it takes to fall that distance is ten seconds.
There are also many attempts at humor, these are also poorly done. The fight scenes involve jumping and twisting actions that not even Simone Biles could perform. There is also a scene where a man seems to be impervious to fire. The dialog was weak and often predictable. While I enjoyed once again hearing the voice of John Forsyth as ""Charlie,"" this movie was boring throughout.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
89,jamiecostelo58,Tacky and absolutely not worth the money.....,3,6 December 2006,"Fans of light relief (and who isn't) will love this Charlie's Angels sequel, but for others who want to witness a film which has some kind of worthwhile plot and credible acting had really better look elsewhere. Both Full Throttle and the 2000 debut film are way too over-the-top and tacky, with atrocious dialogue and ridiculous special effects which not only leave them extremely unconvincing, but an insult to the original TV series. It really is so bad it hurts! I enjoy comedy films and so on, but I simply couldn't raise a smile when viewing this. There's no style or substance, and all three Angels seemed to be in competition with each other rather than looking out for one another as was proved in the original TV version. What's worse is Demi Moore as a 'good Angel turned bad'; not that it can't happen, but to me just feels a little unlikely.There was one highlight in Full Throttle (for me anyway): Jaclyn Smith's brief return as Kelly Garrett. As the only star to remain in the original series' complete run, Jaclyn's comeback in her famous role was most welcome. However, I was disappointed it was only a cameo appearance and not a more substantial return. It was also rather insulting that Jaclyn wasn't even credited for her appearance!Full Throttle is most definitely a movie not to be taken seriously. But this is the problem; the original series WAS taken seriously and has become one of the most celebrated shows in television history. This film and its prequel will not be remembered for its loyal attribution to the original; more likely it will be remembered for its tacky and nonsense approach to 'comedy'. 3/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

There has been not even an attempt to make art, everything is just supposed to be funny and entertaining. Forget art, or what you thought it was! If you want to bash this movie or its makers, there are much of opportunities, but you have as well misunderstood this product. For the idea of the film is just simple, anything is not like it used to be. All the movie makes fun of itself and the whole genre. If you didn't like this movie, perhaps you should watch it again and laugh at it. You'll see how stupid it is, but it was also meant to be that way. Bulletproof bra's are not a bad equipment joke - you would have laughed at them had they appeared on Get Smart or Police Squad. Get this film in its particular way, for this is fresh entertainment from Hollywood. And there's also John Cleese, he would not appear on any crappy product. For he knows how to make people laugh and what it takes. The Parrot joke cannot make you laugh again and again. This is new comedy for new a generation.

It's so ridiculous and not so serious that make it lack of excitement. The angels also don't have much fight sequences, and that make me so disappointing.

93,wchngliu,"A Poor And Desperate Attempt To Cash In On The Francise, C.A Fails By a Long Shot",3,6 September 2007,"I never understood the hype and bravado surrounding the big screen versions of Charlie's Angels because in truth it was and let's face it, it never will live up to, nor match the feat achieved by its 70s TV counterpart. The first film, was well your standard action movie chick flick fare- even though i couldn't stand it, but with this one, it is so over-the-top and downright cheesy it is ridiculous. 3 women, one of whom is of Chinese origin, wear skimpy, skin tight leather/PVC outfits, it was almost like a porn fest, as they attempt to stop a former employee turned villain played by Demi Moore and put an end to her evil plans.The main reason why the sequel was made was because a) the first one did well in the box office and secondly to cash in on the franchise. There were moments during this movie where i'd cringed at the embarrassment of watching this crap fest. The fight scenes looked fake, just as much as the actresses were suspended by wires as such, some of the dialogue was some of the most corniest i've heard in a film and the moments where the angels were frolicking about in the beach, all suited up in leather diving outfits as they were on motorised jet skis were lousy and at the same time they'd reeked of 'attention seeking'. All for the sad benefit of attracting the attention of a couple of well oiled, beef cake males. What a load of tosh i'd say.Another thing that irritated me was the fact that even though they were secret agents, and because they are secret agents, you'd think they'd have an ounce of intellectual beauty, as well as physical beauty. But sadly, most of the time during the film, the women act like silly, giggling little school girls, as opposed to being smart and having credibility and self respect for themselves.Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was so dreadful no wonder it bombed- and rightly so. The stunts and special effects were mostly a direct and blatant rip-off of every sci-fi, martial arts, action film you can think of. For an action movie, this is just beyond woeful, and yet as a so-called, action chick flick, a complete nonsense altogether.I hope that fingers crossed that there will never be a third instalment to the dreadful Charlie's Angels movies ever again.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
94,MairegChernet,"you know McG, it's not all about putting 3 sexy girls altogether, the plot matters too.",5,24 December 2007,"McG, why make a sequel with no plot that has a grip on itself. OK, the first Charlie's angels, at least, kept me awake throughout the movie. the chemistry between Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore was fairly interesting. Bill Murray did a good job as well. the plot,too, was fine. Considering all these positive aspects, I figured it would be worth it to see the sequel. Ruined is not the appropriate word for ""full throttle"". It was just mediocre. The acting was comparatively not bad. And it had Bernie Mac as a new member of the cast. But I still was not impressed by the plot, which was about the angels on the lookout for stolen platinum rings. It wouldn't have hurt the writers to put some twists and turns into the plot. but they just made it plain bad. there were no suspenseful moments into it whatsoever. In fact, I could already infer the end after the movie rolled for some 30 or 40 minutes.But I gotta admit beneath the uninteresting plot, I found some satisfaction watching the angels kick some butt. Demi Moore did a great job of showing us her villain side. Yet, some of the intense action scenes lacked credibility. I mean at some point I felt like I was watching ""The Matrix"". Many unrealistic scenes were put throughout the movie. I am not going to break into it and reveal the specific scenes, but let's just say ""The matrix"" is not the only movie with flying bullets and regular human beings fighting like futuristic robots.If McG is thinking about making a third angels movie, my advice for him is think of a thicker plot and more credible characters.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
95,pri_e,Different from the first installment,6,12 July 2003,"I heard that the sequel was different to the first movie and to me that was proven right. Not only did the movie explore more closely the jobs that the Angels have to do but how it affects them personally. Natalie (Cameron Diaz) has moved in with Pete (Luke Wilson) and is living a pretty happy existence. Alex (Lucy Liu) has taken a time-out from her relationship with Jason (Matt LeBlanc) although it's not really explained why, also she is struggling to tell her father (John Cleese) what her real job is. Dylan (Drew Barrymore) finds her past catching up to her including her penchant for falling for the bad guys. Bernie Mac stars as the new Bosley, who follows the guidance by the Angels about what his job embodies. Demi Moore plays fallen angel Madison Lee, a woman who doesn't have a conscience and looks out only for herself. The one character who I'm so happy returned is the Thin Man (Crispin Glover), not only do you get to learn about his past but you find yourself supporting his character as well.The movie isn't meant to be taken seriously, though I must admit it lost some points with me with some of the overly unrealistic action scenes, I mean there's only a certain amount of unrealistic scenes you can tolerate.

One of the best soundtracks for a film I have ever heard, really well chosen, they fitted so well with the sequences. It was good to see the Girls back in action especially with those amazing stunts and Martial arts moves.Although I missed Bill Murray, Bernie Mac was just as hilarious as Murray was in the first one so was the perfect replacement. It was great to see one of the original angels Jaclyn Smith who happened to be my favourite angel in the series and it wasn't just because I shared her character's first name. She still looks so amazing so did Demi Moore who made the perfect villain and actually looked like she was relishing the role.Also, Bruce Willis does a small cameo in the film and the audience get to find out more about the thin man (Crispin Glover).

And not very bright ones at that.It's great if you want a thrill ride, but that's pretty much all it is.  The problem is that the cutaways during the big FX sequences tend to take away the thrill and make it seem ridiculous or fake.Most of the FX sequences are Matrix-like.  The problem, of course, is that they aren't in a virtual world.  Then, there's a lot of music mixed to be very loud and club-like.  It actually helps to keep the movie moving along (and the audience awake).  The mixes are very well done, even making some ""music"" (corporate pop) that is horrible (can you say Bon Jovi and MC Hammer?) half-way listenable.The problem with the music is that how does 80s music tie in with a movie paying homage to a 70s show?  Or, as the director might try to argue, with the angels growing up period which is set 8-10 years ago.  Grunge, industrial metal, hip-hop, trip-hop, electronica, alternative, or female folk music would be believable.   Plenty of inconsistencies like that.

It's also got Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu three of the biggest babes in Hollywood who make all this buttkicking look DANG GOOD. It's a joy watching them run in and out of different disguises, like some sort of Saturday morning cartoon show. Demi Moore returns to Hollywood as the villain, and plays this vicious woman very well, and best of all Crispin Glover comes back as The Thin Man.Basically it all boils down to this, have some fun with this movie, because this is what this movie is all about, just like it's predessesor.

There are plenty of laughs, big explosions and more than enough T & A to go around, and just like the first film, lots of slick editing from Mr MTV McG.But put simply, that's all there is.  CA2 is a good popcorn flick - albeit incredibly gratuitous.  The story is paper-thin (more often than not confusing - which simply seemed like a ploy to convince the audience to forget about it and focus on the visuals), and then there are the stunts!  These were a big thing for me, and I'm sure you'll agree they were one of the highlights of the first film.  We know the Angels exist in a world with barely a shred of realism, but at least that shred of realism is there!  In the first film they were unbelievable feats of agility and strength. In this film they are STUPIDLY unbelievable to the point of being...well, just lame, and totally NOT believable.  I walked out of this film able to admit that I had enjoyed it.  The rest of the audience did as well. Plenty of laughing, the odd bit of applause and it keeps you entertained all the way through.  But CA2 lacks.  Instead of keeping ALL (keyword here) the elements that worked from the first, injecting something fresh and upping the ante at the same time, CA2 just well, ups the ante.

Sure they found success with such films as Darkness Falls, Anger Management, and Daddy Day Care but they also found their share of problems with flops like Basic and Hollywood Homicide. Bad Boys II looks to raise up summer hopes for the studio but their other two releases, Gigli and S.W.A.T., don't give the rest of the movie-going public much confidence in the studio this summer. So it is no wonder the studio gave Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, the surprise hit of 2000, a huge market push and a prime weekend slot right before the Independence Day weekend. As part of the big marketing push, the studio is bringing temporarily retired actress Demi Moore back to the big screen. Did anybody really notice she left in the first place? Granted she can be a gifted actress but she isn't really known for her box office success but the public seems to love the idea of Demi Moore returning and the ads just make the boys drool. But will this result in a truly quality film, which the first somewhat lacked, or will is all this advertising just gilding the sequel?The story goes; well there really isn't much of a story. If you are going to see Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle looking for a quality story then you are going to see the wrong movie. The story, as far as one can figure, has the three angels once again fighting bad guys while wearing revealing outfits and blowing things up in the process. This time around they are in search of a pair of rings. These rings, nicknamed `Halo', hold a secret code that when putting the two rings together can place the names of everyone placed under the witness protection program. This is not the least of the angels' problems. Dylan, who was placed under the witness protection program before becoming an angel, discovers her old boyfriend Seamus has been released from jail and is after her for ratting him out for a murder that sent him to jail for eight years. If that wasn't enough, fallen angel Madison Lee has plans for the trio as well. Seem complicated? It is but the film just tries to be as fun as possible and doesn't really care about realism in the plot. The story doesn't matter at all for this film which makes it all the better. One should just go into this film and forget about the plot, character development, and anything else that really matters about the quality of a film.The cast of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle has a huge variety of colorful characters with the three ladies from the original returning to reprise their roles. Cameron Diaz, who blames Natalie Cook, does a so-so job with her role. She doesn't really improve on the way she played the character in the first film but hurts it more. All the dumb blonde jokes made about her character or her acting like a dumb blonde gets tiresome very quickly. You think they would have used up all those jokes in the first film but guess not. Lucy Liu returns as Alex Munday but she isn't as focused on as the other angels, which is quite a shame. Drew Barrymore reprises her role as Dylan Sanders. Her character is more of the focus of the film and Barrymore really works well with the role. She makes it her own which works on amazing levels. Much of the marketing or publicity of Full Throttle has focused on the return of Demi Moore and it was well deserved. Demi Moore was quite a delightful surprise as the fallen angel Madison Lee. She fights perfectly with the role and seems to have fun with the character. There were some disappointing things about her character, as good as Moore was. Madison only gets a slight introduction near the beginning and isn't really seen again till the end. Another problem was the fact that they confuse the audience by making her seem sort of like a lesbian with nearly kissing Cameron Diaz's character twice during the film. What was up with that? Other then those problems, her character was absolutely wonderful. Bernie Mac, who replaces Bill Murray as Bosley, is hilarious. There could not have been a more perfect replacement then him. Murray made the Bosley character a hoot in the first films and Mac continues the wonderfully funny charm as Bosley's brother. Crispin Glover once again reprises his role as the creepy Thin Man, even if it is only briefly. Glover truly makes the character creepy but funny at the same time, which is very hard to do.Overall, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a fun ride even if you do tend to get motion sickness every now and then. The sequel seems to try too hard to live up to the hype and the charm of the original but it seems too much at times. Outside the usual problems of no actual story or character development, the film has other problems as well. The CGI is the film is absolutely horrible. Many of the sequences that use computer animation techniques are pretty obvious and they just make the film look pathetic. Some of the action sequences were also ridiculous. During the motorcycle chase scene, the director uses slow motion to show the angels dodging bullets just like in The Matrix Reloaded but he fails to pull the effect off correctly that the obvious parody looks totally absurd. If you are going to parody good effects then do them correctly. The pacing for the film was horrible. At times the feature seems to slow and at other times it is too fast with all the action sequences. There was no consistency at all which hurts the overall effect. With the bad there is also the good. The fight sequences between Cameron and Demi as well as those delightful cameos make the film worthwhile. The best cameo out of the bunch has to be from Demi's ex-husband Bruce Willis. It is not a funny role but it is an absolute treat, so pay attention for it. Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle will not win any awards or much critical praise but that shouldn't matter much to the core audience. Enjoy a good old summer popcorn flick while you cool off from the heat of the summer.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C-)",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
102,kellyadmirer,Soundtrack masquerading as a film,1,9 July 2003,"I went to a movie, and a soundtrack broke out.  I challenge anyone liking this film to try watching it without the '70s disco background tunes and see if they like it half as much.  Also, did they have to buy up the ENTIRE Avril Lavigne catalog to use?  That Pink appears in a healthy-sized cameo shows where this ""movie"" is at.The plot is moronic and at the end does a U-turn that defies even ""Angel"" logic, the gags are stale, every physical stunt looks rehashed from some other film - overall, this is a stinker.  Cameron Diaz looks cadaverous in some of her closeups, Drew Barrymore mopes through her scenes, and Lucy Liu seems to be constantly celebrating the fact that she got this gig in the first place.  Bernie Mac seems constipated.  Matt LeBlanc actually comes off rather well because he is only there to make fun of the whole thing and looks to be having a swell time doing it (""ME-2"" was the best sight-gag in the film).As for Demi Moore, well, if hamming it up and looking, well, surgically stitched together justifies all her breathless media attention for her surprisingly slight role in this trashy picture, then the next time William Shatner appears on screen they should just stop the presses.A few words about the stunts are in order.  The Hollywood trend is for more and more over-the-top action sequences that, in the way they defy gravity, could only realistically take place on the moon.  They obviously are meant in fun and not to be taken realistically - but when they force you to suspend disbelief too much, you start getting distracted.  Pretty soon they'll have one of these action figures jumping off a cliff to climb onto an orbiting space shuttle - it is just getting out of hand.To those guys who have been making a living the last few years with the body wires enabling people to jump 20 feet in the air and then come down and kick the enemy from behind in the butt, PLEASE retire.  It was fresh in ""Crouching Dragon"" and fun in a couple of other films and ""yawn"" in a few more and is now OLD.  Thanks for the effort, but it is OVER and time to GO.The whole film is shot in tongue-in-cheek fashion except for a few out-of-character sequences involving some of the tv-series actors making cameos (Charlie, of course, following the conceit of the Charlie's Angels idea, never physically appears but has what can only be considered a bizarre scene with the Moore character).  John Forsythe and Jaclyn Smith almost seem to be taking the whole thing, well, seriously.  I mean, Oh My God.I hope that this film will start some Hollywood insiders thinking about getting away from the ridiculously impossible stunts that are infesting action films and returning to a more realistic type of hero.  But that is asking too much - the money these days is in the cartoonish characters that walk through raging fires without getting burned and so forth.You might think that this reviewer ""did not get it,"" but I got it, all right - and it stunk.  Austin Powers is like Hamlet compared to this.  Stay away unless you are a true die-hard Angels fan or just have to see if all that money Demi Moore spent on cosmetic surgery was worth it.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
103,ericjg623,What did you expect?,6,1 November 2003,"Honestly, for all the people whining about how they watched this movie and now want that two hours of your life back, what were you thinking when you bought your ticket? That you would get Scorsese? Shakespeare? This is a CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie, for Heaven's sakes! If anything, McG and crew erred in trying to inject a bit of substance into the story, when what made the first CA great was precisely the lack of any serious content. The plot was ridiculous, the villains' motives nonsensical, but who cared? The girls looked great, the fights and stunts were killer, and the whole enterprise was a glorious celebration of style over substance. In fact, what made it stand out was it had the guts and confidence to be itself and make no apologies, nor any concession to standard movie conventions' like insisting on plot and character development. This movie, to the extent it sticks with this approach, succeeds, especially with scenes like the nightclub hot dance number and the high school reunion. Here the girls just radiate pure fun and sex appeal. But then the movie has to go and complicate things with stuff like explaining the origins of the Thin Man and his weird hair fetish and how one of the Angels is essentially running from her past, which includes a psychotic murderer of an ex-boyfriend. Giving credit where due, this is handled with humor, as we find out that Dylan' was originally Helen Zaas, which naturally makes her the butt' of an endless series of bad jokes. And, speaking of butts, Cameron Diaz seems to have hers featured prominently in nearly every scene, much to the delight of male fans. But, ultimately, this movie has a darker, grittier edge than the first, and suffers accordingly for it.
The simple fact is, this franchise (should it continue beyond these first two films) has the potential to be a 21st century version of the Bond series. The whole point of the Bond films, for the most part, was also style over substance. Bond, as a secret agent, was completely unbelievable (as if a true spy would openly announce his real name in public places on a regular basis), but it didn't matter. The man had style and flair, he oozed sex appeal, and when called upon, could kick ass and also use a mind-boggling array of high tech devices to complete his assignment. And these movies have their three heroines doing exactly the same thing. The potential for a continuing hit franchise is definitely there, the principals (Drew, Cameron, Lucy, and McG) clearly have very good interpersonal chemistry), but they need to remember this is about providing non-stop feast for the eyes, shut your brain off bubblegum entertainment. Nothing less and nothing more.

I never heard a person once say, ""Man, I can't stand Austin Powers... it was so fake.""  I'm stretching, but bear with me.  You all must've saw the first one... what REALLY did you think?  Many people loved the Austin Powers trilogy... now they're just HOTTER.  AND THERE'S THREE of them (all HOT).  I have to say i was pleased with this movie.  It was funny and I like comedies.  NOW, if you don't like these kinds of movies, well then that would be like me tearing apart Woody Allen films, or Anime; something like that.  Which I won't do... which I'll probably never see (except Kill Bill which rocked; even the Anime).But I digress.Let's face it.  The action was almost as hot as the three protagonists and the ONE HOT antagonist (or is that the other way around... I don't know my 'agonists'.  So what if they were women, shakin' their moneymakers.  I probably would too if I were yound and hot and a woman.  Maybe not, but I bet I would.  Oh yeah, the action.  The action was great.  It took a lot of work to make them into the wonderful, campy, fast-paced eye candy that they were.The performances were well-done.  Demi Moore was great and hot in this film, too.  Much better to look at than a bald, gray-suit-wearing villain with a squirmy voice.  Throw me a bone, here.  Actually I thought ALL the Austin Powers movies were great.  So were these.

106,antonjsw1,Great fun returns in unoriginal but enjoyable and funny sequel!,7,22 April 2013,"Most of the cast are back, with the notable , but not surprising omission of Bill Murray, especially in light that he was allegedly involved in disagreements with some of the other cast members in the previous film.The plot is more complete this time around. While this film is no way near serious drama, as a fun popcorn film it works very well. Barrymore, Diaz and Liu are yet again very good value and do work well together, giving the proceeding a jolly and fun feel, as they did in the previous film. Supporting players are fun again, including Crispin Glover in a mute role, but most notably Demi Moore, who is great as a former angel who crosses paths with the three leading ladies. She has certainly kept herself in shape! She plays well off the three, and the films winning of two Razzies was more a case of some celebrity bashing rather than it being a poor film. John Cleese also turns up in a very funny cameo.There are some weaknesses, even for this sort of film. The most obvious is that some of the visual fx comes across as cartoonish and some poor digital effects do stand out like a sore thumb. This was a bit of a let-down as the quality in the first film was very good. Overall it holds up well enough, and includes more of the same in terms of super-slow motion shots and bullet time in key action sequences.Despite this what passes for a plot moves along with gusto and leads to a fun and satisfying, if slightly surprising climax. Technical credits are again solid, and Russell's Carpenter's photography (he won an Oscar for his work on Titanic) again stands out, complemented by a good choice of songs.Ignore most of the reviews on this.

All of this is largely thanks to McG, aka the ""director"".It would be one thing, if Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle would take itself seriously, but since the ""original"" didn't do that, why should they bother this time around either.

108,Rooster99,Brutal.,1,21 October 2003,"Hahaha!  Oh my God this movie was so bad it was hilarious!  The whole helicopter sequence was pathetic, but it is Charlie's Angels after all. It's not like they were trying to make Gone with the Wind.  But CA2 really is pathetic.  All the cartoon violence, the idiotic costumes, the non-existent plot, the obviously fake nudity, it is a complete waste of time.  It's also not at all entertaining, even though you know it's supposed to be stupid.  You just get that ""Oh my God is this movie moronic"" feeling over and over again.  The guy who flips upside down to shoot the Angels from his dirt bike!  HAHAHAHAH!  Man, that was terrific!  And I am pretty sure it was supposed to be cool as opposed to completely stupid, but I could be wrong.I doubt it's the worst movie of the year.  There is a lot of eye candy in this film, it has to be better than Gigli (which I haven't seen).  If you can get over the utter stupidity, you might be able to sit through half of it before you have to either get out of the theatre or eject the DVD.  At least if you buy the DVD you can take your time getting through the whole thing.  It's so bad it's likely going to take 4 or 5 tries. But you could invite the guys over just to make fun of it!  At least with the first CA, it was completely hokey the way the Angels beat up entire armies of baddies, but it attempted to maintain some modicum of believability.  CA2 is just an out and out cartoon fantasy.  Totally uneven, terribly fake action sequences, really just an extended music video with bad jokes, bad acting, and bad action sequences.  I loved the part where Drew gets kicked in the teeth 3 times in a row by the big bad baddie and shakes it off. HAHAHAHAHA! Man she's tough!  (NOT)Waste of time.  I'll give it a 3 out of 10, one for each Angel just because they are willing to debase themselves with this utter drivel.  Now that takes courage!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The actresses are still fun to watch, the personal life subplots don't stop the movie dead in its tracks like the first film and Demi Moore is a great villain.  Unfortunately, McG's approach to action scenes seems to be the more phony looking the better.  There not only is nothing action wise in this movie that even approaches the very outer edges of believability--there's nothing that looks like it was even done with stunt-men.  Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle appears to have only slightly less computer animation than Finding Nemo.  To put it another way, the action scenes in this movie make the most outre sequences in XXX look like models of low-key neo-realism.  It's hard to generate any genuine thrills when your action looks so fake, but if you want a couple hours of mindless, silly bubble-gum Hollywood product, this is likely the movie for you.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
111,crazyrabbits,"McG, why? WHY????",1,3 June 2006,"I'll just say it up front: I hate this film. If anything, this film should have been BETTER than the first movie. Instead, it just sucks the life right out of you.For those of you who haven't seen the film, the plot goes like this: the three ""Angels"" (played by Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu) are dispatched to retrieve two bracelets which contain the names of secret CIA operatives, and end up getting into more trouble (read: unbelievable and unintentionally hilarious situations), as well as having to fight some old enemies.Oh, who am I kidding? This film is nothing like that description. It's just a parade of never-ending cameos, bad acting, cheesy situations and no soul. The Angels run into numerous characters (most of whom are extraneous filler), including into the pale thin man from the first film (and yes, he still has a fetish for hair, as well as uncontrollable screaming), original Angel Kelly Garrett (and here I thought this was a remake! Guess not), Bruce Willis as a CIA agent (yeah, it was ironic that he gets killed by his ex-wife. Har-har.), Eve, Pink, the Olson Twins (!!!), and even Carrie Fisher, reprising her role from ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"".Heck, even the new characters in the film are shallow and derivative people. Probably the biggest addition is Demi Moore as Madison Lee, who (in an excuse to show us how much she's toned up) takes to posing for the camera on numerous occasions, if only to show us her well-crafted physique. John Cleese and Luke Wilson are here, but they are relegated to meaningless roles, and never get a chance to display any real material. Robert Patrick is in this film as well, and gets to deliver a truly horrible performance (his line, ""Hey, we did it! Partner!"" may be the most unintentionally funny reveal I've ever seen in a film). There's even this Irish mobster named Seamus who's just...there. Needless to say, they all drag the movie down. It's a shame that Bill Murray isn't back, because he was a great sidekick for the three female characters, delivered some witty one-liners, and the film never really recovers from his absence.It seems like there was just a whole lot of material that was inserted into the film to drive the plot, but it screws up the whole purpose of the first film. First, we are asked to believe that Dylan willingly hung out with an Irish mobster who would hit her, and that she was aware of his dealings, yet never did anything about it. Then, we are asked to believe that the Bosley from the first film was an adopted child, who lived in the same home with another child (also named Bosley), who just happens to fill in for him whenever he goes on vacation. Finally, we are asked to believe that there was another Angel who just went renegade for no reason and wants to kill the other three Angels because of jealousy. Yeah. Right.I don't even understand the character motivations in this film. The creepy thin man doesn't do very much except sniff hair and stalk the Angels around. Madison doesn't do a whole lot except shoot CIA informants, shoot voice boxes, and surf. Even some of the operations undertaken by the Angels are done only for T&A shots. That's it.The physics and situations in this film are portrayed like some sort of hyper-realistic video game. There's no way in hell that you could drive a truck loaded with a helicopter off the back off a dam, have everyone climb into the helicopter, start it up, then take off, IN MID AIR, all in the space of 30 seconds. There is also no way that all of the Angels have ridiculously adept fighting maneuvers, such as leaping out of the way of oncoming bullets AND explosives, being able to fight after getting kicked in the face several times, as well having a man be able to jump off a motorbike, flip upside-down, shoot bullets from your gun, then get back ONTO your bike before they hit the ground. At least with the first film, when characters got hit, they were actually injured. Here, all semblance of reality has gone out the window.Bottom Line: It's terrible. I saw this film at a drive-in, and I hung out at the concession stand for the better part of the movie talking to the cashier and trying not to watch what was unfolding behind me. It really is that bad. Skip it at all costs.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
112,RJBose,"Facinatingly Idiotic at First, Then Just Idiotic",2,18 November 2003,"The merits (or apparent lack thereof) of ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" have been amply cataloged elsewhere; this dismal failure of a movie has no plot, characters who inexplicably magically defy all laws of physics, and a series of scenes loosely strewn together to create opportunities for leering at a) scanty outfits, b) girls dancing or c) both, for the three leads, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz. Two things struck me, however, which I have not seen discussed: the scary psychological profile of Producer Drew Barrymore, and the racist and demeaning characterization of Bosley (and family) portrayed by Bernie Mac. The whole movie seems to be a preposterous fantasy sequence of some lonely, insecure adolescent girl: the men are all weird/weak/sadistic and or villainous; the girls are all supportive and dance and giggle together. The Thin Man is some weirdo with a hair fetish, the Irish thug is a sadistic criminal, and the two boyfriends are sappy window dressing. (I wonder where Joey Trebiani left Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Rachel and Ross- his character is the exact same one he plays in ""Friends"").  The only real threat to the three ""Angels"" is another woman; all are omnipotent geniuses with magical powers.  This is straight out of an troubled 11 year old's daydreams of power- the only thing missing was invisibility and mind reading.  Of course, since Miss Barrymore's formal education ended somewhere around that age, about the same time her drug and other problems began, this $120 million daydream of hers simply (but expensively) brought to the big screen should really come as no surprise. As for Bernie Mac's Bosely, he did everything but have his hair stand on end and stammer ""Yezzum, Ah thinks Ah done seens a ghost! O Lawdy Lawdy! Saves me Massa!"" while clutching a watermelon. Why is there no comment, let alone outrage from the African-American community in Hollywood (or elsewhere) about this?  It was a racist, stereotypical and highly insulting caricature, more suited to some 1920's low budget comedy than a major studio release of 2003.  A bumbling Black man speaking in an ungrammatical minstral dialect (""Man, I'm gettin' me one of them for my house!"") kept for comic relief by his patronizing mistresses (""We love you Bosley- you answer the phone!"") and seeking approval from his mother, is surely from a long gone and dark era in our culture. I am not African-American, but I found his wildy exaggerated Stepinfetchit stammering and groveling outrageous for a 21st Century film.

114,rams_lakers,Most stupid movie ever,1,8 July 2004,"The original TV angels were the best by far. They should have had the lookalikes who did that Charlies Angels TV special do the movie. That girl playing Jaclyn Smith was almost a dead ringer. The first Angel movie was OK and watchable, despite the silliness. Bill Murray helped it. Lucy Liu is very attractive but has too much attitude, possibly why she and Murray didn't get along. I'd like to know the full story on that, which sounds more interesting then seeing both movies again. I like Drew Barrymore in some roles (Wedding Singer) but not as an Angel. The best of Cameron Diaz can be found in Something About Mary, in these 2 Angel movies she just overdoes the grinning and the silly antics. On to the review. This is the most irritatingly stupid movie I ever saw. The Angels don't use guns, which is silly. I hate political correctness in this fashion. They don't need guns, because they can fight like Bruce Lee. In fact, they are top notch at everything they do which includes riding a motorbike standing on their heads. Just totally ridiculous and unbelievable situations and stunts like they were James Bond x3. A movie doesn't need action every second to be good. A better story would have been fine. I really wanted to shut it off midway through, but I decided to give it a chance. It blew it's chance. These 3 starlets looked like they had too much fun making it, and the outtakes which were funny in the first one are awful in this one. Bernie Mac as a black Bosley, there's another political correctness that I can't stand. Let's get more blacks to see the movie is what the producers are saying. It's not quite like those typical black star/white star team up flicks but it rings a similar tune.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do NOT waste your time.

115,Zoopansick,"""It empowers young women""....yeah right!",4,29 June 2003,"Ok first off the movie itself is really dumb and shallow.  Still it can be fun, especially if you are just looking for some mindless entertainment, lord knows I can only watch The Seventh Seal so many times before, I crave stylized violence and one liners.  I was in such a mood when I went to see Charlie's Angels.  I left the theater thinking that it was pretty dumb, but Bernie Mac was funny and it kept me awake.  The real problem I have with the movie is the way it's promoted and with the lack of ANY originality.
Starting with the promotion.  I have seen at least 3 different interviews with Demi Moore and the ""Angels"" who say things like ""This movie shows three strong female characters, and proves women can be tough too"".  That is so blatantly wrong that it makes me mad enough to post.  This movie has no positive role models.  It is total T&A and when they promote it as anything other then that I feel insulted.  If you say that's what you are selling, ok, I have no problem.  But when you try to elevate the content of a turd like this, you are smacking every person with any smarts at all in the face. The characters have no depth and the audience doesn't care about them at all.  They say in the beginning that they are ""3 very different women"", but that's BS.  They are all hot chicks who know kung fu and make stupid jokes. They aren't smart at all.  **Minor Spoiler** When they find the footprint in the house, Drew Barrymore (I think) says what the shoe is and where it was sold and in a few seconds they add it all together and know who they are looking for.  That isn't intelligence, that's just a cheap way to 1)spoof CSI (I'll go into spoofing later), 2)cop out of ANY detective work, which the Angels in the series at least had SOME (not much) of, 3)moving the story along (I can't believe I just said story in reference to this movie) and 4)allowing people to describe the Angels as being ""Smart"" on the imdb message board.  In the action scenes the angels beat up the bad guys really easily and there is no tension at all, in fact I have felt more tension in a Hitchcock ending credit sequence then I did in any fight scene in Full Throttle.  I say this because it removes any vulnerability from the characters.  They are just untouchable super chicks who have been predestined by the writers to win every fight and solve the great ""mystery"" with no effort at all.  There is nothing to them.  That means they are what some in the ""Biz"" call 2-D characters.  NOT role models for girls, and not even particularly memorable female action characters.  Of which there are many, who (with a few exceptions) are dumb, but sexy chicks, who with one kick can knock out a huge muscle bound thug.  The problem is not that they are women, the problem is that they are mindless characters who are all roughly the same character duplicated ad nausem.  The Angels here are no different, and in fact where more rounded in the television series then they are here.  And let me tell you something, the TV series was not called ""jiggle tv"" for nothing.Anyways that aside there are many problems with the movie.  The main one is of course the lack of plot, but as I said there have been many fun action pictures in the past which though lacking plot, are fun and at least visually interesting.  My theory on why this movie in particular seems exceptionally plotless is because of the countless, spoofs, cameos, and blatant rip-offs (Which I have laughably heard as being described as ""influences"").  The high number of spoofs and rip-offs show just how little the writers had to try when ""writing"" the ""plot"".  **SPOILER** Oh and btw if the plot itself is a retread of the first movie, in which the villains use the angels to get some high tech device under the guise of rescuing a helpless victim.  C'mon!!!! I know it's a sequel, but they could have done a little more with the plot, or as I refer to it ""The excuse for dancing, cameos, and stupid action"".  And the action is stupid.  The bullet dodging is slightly tweaked from the Matrix-style bullet dodging.  You see in the matrix it was original and it looked better.  The CGI here is HORRIBLE!!! You would think that they would at least spend the money to get some good special effects, but they don't.  Even the bits of glass and debris from exploding buildings looks cut and pasted onto the screen, not to mention the characters.  The cameos are mostly stupid and give the film a really fake feel.  Cameos can be funny and entertaining, see Austin Powers Goldmember. But I don't think anyone in the theater was laughing when they saw Eve or Pink.  John Cleese got laughs just because he was Cleese, and people love Monty Python.  But for one second let's look at what he actually did.  He had a couple brief scenes and all he had to do was look shocked and ask his daughter to do the ferret (what's up with that anyway?).  His role could have been played by anyone else and didn't call for any of his talents of comedic timing nor did he have any good lines.  In fact his role could have been removed all together.  The cameos just take you out of the movie as do the constant rip offs.  A movie like this is supposed to be escapist fun, but it failed.  I was just counting the celebrities who pimped themselves out and get more exposure.  But I'm sure they would say that they wanted to ""join the fun"" of making Charlie's Angels FULL THROTLE!!!  YET ANOTHER thing that really disrupted the flow of the movie was the constant changing of loud music.  This soundtrack must have like 50 songs on it, because I swear they would change the music like every 30 seconds.  The most hilarious display of music and stupidity ***BTW another spoiler, but really if you get offended by this one, I'm glad I made you mad, cause you deserve it*** is when they flash back to Barrymore and her Irish Mafia boyfriend ""8 years ago"", where, dressed like hair-metal rockers they are rocking out to Bon Jovi.  I don't know about you, but in 1995 I don't think Bon Jovi was too popular.  You would think that music video meister McG would have known that, but he didn't.  This may be minor, but to me it strikes at the core of the films flaw, which is that nothing is put together, it's all a jumbled mass (or mess, whichever you prefer).  I mean if they can't even get their pop music timeline right, what can they do right?  Nothing.  The film is just like a music video.  It just jumps all around, from cameo to pointless dance sequence to fake action scene to cameo to another cameo to spoof to stupid make up to cameo to bad cgi etc. etc. etc.The final verdict is that this movie is bad and McG is the worst director in the world.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
116,claudemercure,a little disappointing,7,22 April 2005,"The first movie totally rocked. Here, I was a little disappointed.Bill Murray was a better Bosley than Bernie Mac, and Demi Moore is merely adequate as the villain, but both those facts might have something to do with a deeper difference between the two films. In its effort to top the original, Full Throttle ends up too fast, and overstuffed, leaving no room for the actors to breathe. Mac and Moore aren't even given the chance to deliver complete characters. We also got more out of the three title characters the first time around, performance-wise.These films might be all about fun, but the first one did benefit from a more human touch. This one is all dazzle, and apparently no effort was made to maintain visual continuity. Each ""Check this out!"" scene looks and feels like it's from a different film. The result is a movie I enjoyed as I watched it, but one that I will probably not watch again. And though one of the joys of the first movie is the way it goes over the top, this one actually goes too far. Director McG forgot that even going over the top has to be done just right.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

I was simply to watch an uncomplicated easy movie while having my popcorn. I was absolutely right. Having seen the first movie I knew that I was not to be disappointed again!! In fact, I found this sequel a bit more entertaining. Three beautiful actress overly acting with the help of stunts was quite enjoyable. But, I cant say that it is my type of movie. For fun it is fine but for people like me who think they should get satisfaction for every pence they pay to get to see it, it is bad. ** out of ***** for entertainment and Lucy Lu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
119,Sisiutil,Left me cold,3,4 July 2003,"I briefly dated, in my youth, this drop-dead gorgeous party girl. It ended quickly, as soon as she tried to turn serious; not because I wouldn't have been into that--it's just that she was so obviously insincere.Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a lot like that wild girl from my past. Great to look at, loads of fun, but the moment it tries for any drama or honest feeling, you know it's just screwin' with ya. There are lots of examples of movies/shows that boast an action thrill ride and compelling drama while not taking themselves too seriously--Buffy, for example, or Spider-Man. But this flick spends so long not taking itself seriously that when it tries to switch gears it just strips them instead.
There are, as I said, lots of dynamic action sequences, shot in that dizzying, acrobatic, music video style that everybody thinks they have to use these days (like Star Wars before it, The Matrix has proven both a blessing and a curse). And yes, the four girls (3 good, one VERY bad) are easy on the eyes, especially in all those fetishy get-ups. (And this is supposed to have a post-feminist subtext? Yeah, right.)
But this uber-reality CA:FT takes place in began to feel too stylized, too detached, too ironic. Hey, I wasn't expecting anything like character development or a cohesive plot; this is a summer action movie, after all. But the film-makers forgot a basic rule: before you place your protagonists in danger, make us care about them. And another forgotten rule: when the danger shows up, it has to be really dangerous.The movie makes its first mistep early on, starting with an action sequence so spectacularly over-the-top it would make Cubby Broccoli wince. Another mistep follows. Bruce Willis, in a pointless cameo, gets killed (along with scores of government agents protecting him); then we cut to our three girls bustin' a move to MC Hammer. The immediate message: don't worry about death and danger; we're here to party! Grrl Power! Woo-hoo!That's pretty much the tone that's maintained until Demi Moore shows up in full vamp mode (just after a pointless, cliche-ridden cameo by Jacklyn Smith). Then the movie wants to have it both ways; after an hour of cartoonish action (and I'm insulting cartoons with that comparison), we're suddenly expected to believe that the danger is REAL this time. Well sorry, but by then I'd developed such a post-post-post-modernist ironic distance from the whole mess that I was halfway out the door.I should have kept going. As it was, I wound up with the same feeling you'd get after consuming cotton candy for an hour and a half: icky, sticky, and wondering how the hell you ever thought it would be a good idea in the first place. 3/10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

121,dantown,a silly movie for people who like silly people who are silly,10,31 December 2005,"I loved this movie. I saw it in a motel room at 12am in Gilroy California. Boy was I glad. Motel rooms, and 500 road miles take the edge off a man. I just wanted to see a movie, any movie, and chill out. Cameron Diaz is just the slightest idea of a movie star. Don't you agree? And yet, she just blows your doors off in this movie. Why? Well, because she is an actor and a comedian after all. She has a talent that makes this movie GO. She consistently meets and exceeds expectations. As well,fortunately enough, her two co-stars, Drew and Lucy, just continually deliver in this PARODY of the Charlie's Angels series. A parody is an imitation of something in order to ridicule it. This movie is an inspired parody of nearly everything. It is not meant to be ""Important, nor real nor necessarily artistic"". Yet, this parody is artistic and lovely and beautiful. There is love and joy in it. There is a playful art and craft to this movie which is memorable. The creators of this movie took the -perhaps- limited acting capacity of its three principal actors, Cameron, Drew, and Lucy Liu, and crafted a masterpiece of comedy. Bernie Mac certainly helped. This is not a great movie, but it is a great comedy. A ridiculous story. A classic.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

They model in their underwear, wander from one lousy story to another and just make complete and utter fools of themselves.Where did this come from? Is there a dark and dreary place within Drew Barrymore (who produced the original) that manifests itself as this piece of garbage? This movie has so many flaws: a confusing narrative, a non-existent story, gratuitous and grotesque images and the biggest sin of all? A WASTED all star cast that includes some of the funniest and most likable actors ever. What are John Cleese, Demi Moore, Carrie Fisher and all the others doing in this lousy excuse for a movie?! I know most people would simply say I should just enjoy the movie but this isn't a movie. It's a thing, a construct of so many tired formulas and ideas that not even this galaxy of stars can breath life into. And what were the three stars thinking?! Barrymore, Diaz and Liu are three very beautiful and talented women but this showcases the utter worst of their talents such as making William Shatner look like Humprehey Bogart.Bottom-line? This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. And I dread the day when we get ""Charlies Angels 3"" otherwise known as the apocalypse.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
123,captnemo,"Pointless, forgettable and beyond my ability to suspend disbelief.",3,30 June 2003,"This ""film"" goes so overboard that it numbs the mind after about 30 minutes. It is sloppy where it should be sharp- the motorcycle races, the jumps to proper conclusions based upon the flimsiest of clues, the incompetence/competence of the Ernie Mac character. Some of the film is still not clear. I still don't know what Crispin Glover what supposed to be doing in the story. The SPFX are awful, with white matte lines showing everywhere, especially during the motorcycle races. I just can't believe anything I see in this film. I know it's supposed to be ""Fun"" but it also should be at least slightly competent. People won't go to see a favorite character or concept just because you make a film with that character in its title. Just look at how poorly Daredevil did compared to what the studio was anticipating it would make. Mr. McG must have the attention span of a gnat, or he believes that his audience does. One last point: whenever I see Drew Barrymore, I see a 12 year old. I just can't take her seriously as an adult.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
124,tramsbottom,Stupid but genuinely good fun,7,10 July 2003,"First off, if you hated the first movie or want shakespearian dialogue and a testing plot, don't bother to watch CA: Full Throttle.McG's aim is just to have a great time with great action and great music (check), and he pulls it off.  Apart from some bad editing near the end, the movie is wall to wall fun and if you suspend disbelief (things tend to blow up for no reason) you'll have a blast.On one hand I was depressed - there really is no story here and it's completely vacuous, but on the other hand McG knows his audience and whereas something like Tomb Raider was vacuous just to make some money, Full Throttle is all about Diaz, Lui, Barrymore and McG enjoying themselves and having it up there on the screen.Lesson to up and coming film-makers: if you're going to make an action movie with no plot, you better make sure it's good fun.  Full Throttle is a guilty pleasure that should be taken with a pinch of salt and a huge goofy grin on your face.And that Justin Theroux sure buffed up for his role as Seamus.

125,CMUltra,"Fantastic, live-action cartoon fun!",7,12 July 2003,"We caught a double at the matinee today and perhaps I found CA:FT so much fun due to the comparison of the pretty lousy League of Extraordinary Gentlemen we had just seen.  But, fun it was!I went in hoping for more of the satirical flair that made the first one enjoyable.  CA:FT delivered.  This is the way movies about campy TV shows *should* be made.  An over-the-top parody that keeps you gasping and laughing the entire time.If you want ""realistic"" action, this movie is NOT it.  This is a live-action cartoon, beautifully shot in a kinetic MTV style.  Cameos are numerous (""Is that Bruce Willis?""  ""Hey, Pink!"") and watch for plenty of little homages to various campy TV series of the same genre.Most of all, sit back and enjoy!  The three angels are as goofy as ever with their satire-sincerity and ""fierce"" poses.  They each have a distinct personality trait which helps all the little subplots keep moving along.The supporting cast was fine too.  Bernie Mac's Bosley was an improvement over the first.  Lots of laughs!  Demi's Madison character was okay, but I kept getting the impression she was trying too hard.  This is a parody and Madison should have been a hammed-up villainess, but Moore remained too seriously focused. This caused the character to seem out of step with the rest of the movie.  John Cleese was fine too.  His part was small and generally consisted of the tired joke of miscommunication about his daughter's (Liu) occupation.If you enjoyed the first Charlies Angels, see this!

128,zofos,One Of The Dumbest Movies You Will Ever See In Your Life,1,4 June 2008,"I enjoyed the first ""Charlie's Angels"" movie. It was a lot of fun and had some ridiculously enjoyable Matrix-style wire work and shots of sexy Cameron Diaz gyrating in her undies.Then I saw the trailer for ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and we have old MILF Demi Moore looking surgically-enhanced great in her black bikini and young hottie Cameron Diaz looking angelically pure in her white bikini and the implication of a lesbian kiss between them...I thought: ""Mmm, yes."" Then I saw the movie. And it's heart-stoppingly bad. This movie really is the dumbest movie you will ever see in your life. You will actually become less intelligent by watching it.As the producer, Drew Barrymore has to shoulder a lot of the blame here. It's as if she called a script meeting and said: ""Okay, here's the idea for the new movie...we just sing or dance the whole time to classic hits from the 80s and 90s like ""Livin' On A Prayer"" by Bon Jovi or ""U Can't Touch This"" by MC Hammer...We'll have a guy try to do an Irish accent and fail miserably...then we'll have Demi Moore FLYING (yes, that's right, FLYING) around with her winged cape at the end and that will be great, right?"" Eh, nope, it isn't. It's not a movie, it's just one unrelated, stupid scene blurring into the next, one song being mimed after another or a pointless dance routine (Cameron Diaz probably insisted on that, she dances in every movie she's in). There's no humour, no intelligence, no point. It's hard to believe they got it so wrong.It's a movie for undemanding girls under 10 with it's 24/7 ""girl power"" male-bashing.

131,johnnysugar,"Bigger, Better, Faster, More!",9,23 July 2003,"2000's ""Charlie's Angels"" was a perfect emulation of the 1970's television show on which it was based: stylish, adventurous, exciting, and without a brain in its pretty celluloid head.  Of course, that was part of its charm, a knowing wink at the audience that let us know that the cast and crew were in on the mindless, half-satirical whimsy of the film.  You sat down, turned off logic, and just enjoyed the ride.  The sequel offers a whole lot more of the same and then some.The Angels are as before -- tough-chick Dylan (Drew Barrymore), ditsy but resourceful Natalie (Carmeron Diaz), and no-nonsense Alex (Lucy Liu) -- but teamed with a new Bosley (Bernie Mac).  Someone's stolen HALO, a pair of titanium rings that include microchips that when combined form a list of every person on the FBI's Witness Relocation Program.  The Angels, of course, have to find the thief and get HALO back before it's sold to one of the organized crime cartels desperate to get their hands on it.  But nothing is ever that easy, and the Angels have to deal with a released Irish mobster (Justin Theroux), an orphaned 15-year-old (Shia LeBouf), the return of the creepy Thin Man (Crispin Glover), and the motives of an ex-Angel (Demi Moore).  The rest of the supporting cast is back, including Luke Wilson and Matt LeBlanc, with the addition of John Cleese in a small but hilarious role as Alex's father.The Angels are as winning as ever, with all giving great comedic performances, especially Cameron Diaz (who's given no less than three dance numbers).  While Bill Murray was a good emulation of the original Bosley from the television show, Bernie Mac is refreshing as a sincere yet slightly clueless version of the character.  The supporting cast is just as nice to watch, even if Theroux's ""Irish"" accent borders on laughable.  The only member of the cast that isn't in on the joke of the movie is Demi Moore, returning to film after a self-imposed exile.  While Moore still looks great and carries the mannerisms and stylings of ex-Angel Madison Lee well, her acting has not improved, and she tries to give one of her Serious Performances in a film that desperately doesn't need one.  There's probably a reason why she's nowhere to be seen in the blooper reels contained in the film's credits.McG was a music video director before taking on films, and that training has served him well.  The music in the film -- which ranges from ""Firestarter"" by Prodigy to ""Last Dance"" by Donna Summer -- is used to supreme effectiveness, giving great tone and accent to every scene.  Like the first film, ""CA: FT"" is full of bright colors, outrageous costumes, and fast and furious action sequences that come together into a fast-paced but coherent whole, a rare feat for summer action films that usually devolve into a morass of chaotic editing.  McG handles his cast well and with the exception of Moore (see above), all are game for the director's vision.  Plot takes a backseat to visuals here, but that's all for the best, as the visuals are often enough to drive the film by themselves.  Everything looks good here, and McG has peppered the film with enough cameos (including Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Bruce Willis, and Jaclyn Smith reprising her role as Kelly Garrett from the original series) to keep the audience on their toes.""CA: FT"" is as enjoyable as its predecessor, but it's amped everything up to the next level, as action sequels almost always do.  Still, in a summer filled with dull superheroes (""The Hulk""), excessively violent spectacles (""T3"" and ""Bad Boys II"") and general action-film ineptitude (""LXG""), this film is an exciting and invigorating entry into summer movie escapism.  9 out of 10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
132,vamp88,better then the first,6,29 June 2003,"Full Throttle was better then the first. That's not really saying much. I went into this with low expectations and did enjoy it, but you have to realize that like many action flicks you have to suspend reality. With Full Throttle you have to totally toss it right out the window and just except that the action could've been ripped right out of cartoon. Even then the cartoons are much more believable. It was fun to watch ""eye candy"" if you will. So if you want a light hearted visually exciting movie without much of anything else enjoy and escape. If you want an exciting action flick realize the action is just too over the top to be at all believable or exciting just fun to watch. One more thing, Bernie Mac did a good job making you forget about Bill Murray (far and away the best part of the first movie), although you still wish he was there. And John Cleese was great.

136,trancejeremy,"Increased the campiness, forgot to add a compelling villain",7,13 September 2005,"Some people seem to be missing the point of this movie. It's meant to be campy and way over the top, especially special effects wise. Yes, the fights and stunts are fake, but it's making fun of movies that do almost the same thing, but mean it seriously (like say, Crouching Tiger, or the Matrix sequels, or XXX, and so on...). Actually, it also copies recent Asian films trend of having everything in the scene the same basic color.The real trouble with the movie is that it simply isn't as interesting as the first. Crispin Glover (of all people) really made a wonderful villain in the first, but in this, you simply have Demi Moore, who looks good, but offers little else (and really, she has little screen time, except at the final showdown), and some generic UK hooligan type inauthentically played by an American. (Very few actors from the UK can convincingly play Americans, the opposite are almost non-existent. And he's not one of them.)While the movie is fun, it does seem to sink to the level of sleaze that the ""Women in Prison"" episodes of the original TV show did. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but does seem to clash with the rest of the movie.Still, on the plus side, it doesn't have Tom Green in it.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
137,fewald139,Absolutely ridiculous,6,8 October 2019,"And we're back with the second Charlie's Angels featuring Cameron Diaz as the energetic and giggly Natalie, Drew Barrymore as the feisty metalhead Dylan, and Lucy Liu as the perfectionist Alex. After a ten to fifteen year gap since watching these movies the first time, I just gave the first Charlie's Angels an 8/10 and found it held up really well in terms of dumb fun. How does Full Throttle compare? Well...First things first: if you panned the first, you'll hate this one. If you found the first stupidly enjoyable, there's a lot to love here. The characters are all great. Bernie Mac fits the Bosley role much better than Bill Murray; while Murray was entertaining, Mac actually made me laugh out loud and his personality just fits the bubbly mood of the film better. In my last review I mentioned that Alex was the only angel who failed to impress, simply because she wasn't given as many moments to shine. They fixed this issue here; Liu shines as brightly as Diaz and Barrymore and even has a fantastic running gag with the always fantastic John Cleese.Speaking of John Cleese, there are lots of surprise cameos in Full Throttle. Demi Moore goes above and beyond in her role as Madison Lee. Crispin Glover returns for his fantastically weird performance as the Creepy Thin Man. A young Shia LaBeouf has a small role many years before yelling at us to ""just do it."" A quick cameo by Pink just seals the deal on an oddly nostalgic early 2000s line-up. (Though Melissa McCarthy doesn't have a role here like she did in the first, she does make a weird credits-only cameo.)What does Full Throttle do right? Like the first, it has a ton of fun. It's flashy, its soundtrack is kick-*ss, its set pieces are many and varied, the costumes and situations are beautifully ridiculous, and its comedy is goofier than the first. What are its issues? Well, director McG must have heard how the ridiculous action of the first was both loved and loathed, because he went waaay far in pushing it into unbelievable territory. Much like the Fast & Furious franchise forgot how physics work as the series progresses, Full Throttle takes any smidgen of credibility the first one had (i.e. not much) and throws it out the window. Even worse? To pull this off, the effects often look REALLY bad.For example: in one later scene, the angels get shot in mid-air by a powerful pistol. Their bodies (again, in mid-air) jerk back in reaction to the bullet while still twirling back. The effect is so badly done (not to mention the green screen in the background this whole time) that any sense of immersion is broken. This isn't just an aging thing; I remember seeing this in theaters with my friend and thinking the effects looked bad even then. Full Throttle had a larger budget than its predecessor, but its effects are worse and sometimes verge into awful territory. As a kid, I called BS on one scene near the end featuring Demi Moore in a wingsuit because it was too ridiculous to be real; as an adult, I understand wingsuits ARE a real thing, but the effects are just bad to the point that it LOOKS fake. I can't blame my child-self for pointing at it and proclaiming, ""Ha! Yeah, NO.""The story in this one is even weaker than the first. It makes you ask questions like, ""Wait, what was her point in doing this? Why are they here? What's the connection between these two? How did these two people meet? Why did this character suddenly switch sides? What happened to ___ from the first movie? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?""

138,fewald139,Absolutely ridiculous,6,18 October 2019,"And we're back with the second Charlie's Angels featuring Cameron Diaz as the energetic and giggly Natalie, Drew Barrymore as the feisty metalhead Dylan, and Lucy Liu as the perfectionist Alex. After a ten to fifteen year gap since watching these movies the first time, I just gave the first Charlie's Angels an 8/10 and found it held up really well in terms of dumb fun. How does Full Throttle compare? Well...First things first: if you panned the first, you'll hate this one. If you found the first stupidly enjoyable, there's a lot to love here. The characters are all great. Bernie Mac fits the Bosley role much better than Bill Murray; while Murray was entertaining, Mac actually made me laugh out loud and his personality just fits the bubbly mood of the film better. In my last review I mentioned that Alex was the only angel who failed to impress, simply because she wasn't given as many moments to shine. They fixed this issue here; Liu shines as brightly as Diaz and Barrymore and even has a fantastic running gag with the always fantastic John Cleese.Speaking of John Cleese, there are lots of surprise cameos in Full Throttle. Demi Moore goes above and beyond in her role as Madison Lee. Crispin Glover returns for his fantastically weird performance as the Creepy Thin Man. A young Shia LaBeouf has a small role many years before yelling at us to ""just do it."" A quick cameo by Pink just seals the deal on an oddly nostalgic early 2000s line-up. (Though Melissa McCarthy doesn't have a role here like she did in the first, she does make a weird credits-only cameo.)What does Full Throttle do right? Like the first, it has a ton of fun. It's flashy, its soundtrack is awesome, its set pieces are many and varied, the costumes and situations are beautifully ridiculous, and its comedy is goofier than the first. What are its issues? Well, director McG must have heard how the ridiculous action of the first was both loved and loathed, because he went waaay far in pushing it into unbelievable territory. Much like the Fast & Furious franchise forgot how physics work as the series progresses, Full Throttle takes any smidgen of credibility the first one had (i.e. not much) and throws it out the window. Even worse? To pull this off, the effects often look REALLY bad.For example: in one later scene, the angels get shot in mid-air by a powerful pistol. Their bodies (again, in mid-air) jerk back in reaction to the bullet while still twirling back. The effect is so badly done (not to mention the green screen in the background this whole time) that any sense of immersion is broken. This isn't just an aging thing; I remember seeing this in theaters with my friend and thinking the effects looked bad even then. Full Throttle had a larger budget than its predecessor, but its effects are worse and sometimes verge into awful territory. As a kid, I called BS on one scene near the end featuring Demi Moore in a wingsuit because it was too ridiculous to be real; as an adult, I understand wingsuits ARE a real thing, but the effects are just bad to the point that it LOOKS fake. I can't blame my child-self for pointing at it and proclaiming, ""Ha! Yeah, NO.""The story in this one is even weaker than the first. It makes you ask questions like, ""Wait, what was her point in doing this? Why are they here? What's the connection between these two? How did these two people meet? Why did this character suddenly switch sides? What happened to ___ from the first movie? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?"" You finally realize that searching for answers just gives you too big of a headache, so you let the movie slide and lean back to be entertained by good music and explosions.I had a lot more fun with Full Throttle than my rating of 6 implies.

140,DennisH,Proof that talent does not equal skill,3,10 July 2004,"Man, this movie was torture. The rating and everyone's comments are a good indicator that this movie is crap. Pure crap. What amazes me is that if you look at it from a technical standpoint, McG actually knows what he's doing. He clearly knows color, camera angles, composition, and given a good budget, he is a special effects wizard. It's just that his choices and taste are awful, and notably, he has a glaring weakness for directing actors. I'm amazed from a visual standpoint that he knows what's good, how could he think this movie was? 3 out of 10, and that's just for the effects.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
141,DaveZ,SHOULD be throttled,4,2 July 2003,"There is no rule that says action films must be totally logical and grounded in reality; in fact, that would be a bad idea, sucking all of the fun out of the genre.  This sequel, however, goes so far in the opposite direction from logic and reality that I began to wonder if it was actually a Naked Gun-type spoof. The rules of physics and physiology were apparently dropped from the helicopter at the beginning of the film and never seen again.  Obviously no one intended for this film to be taken totally seriously, but as the film grew more and more ludicrous, I grew more and more frustrated.Good actors like Luke Wilson, John Cleese and others are wasted in subplots that go absolutely nowhere.  Was the kid added to the plot to enable us to see Bosley's family, or was Bosley's family added as a place to park the kid?  Who knows and who cares?I enjoyed the first film quite a bit.  Have my tastes changed THAT much, or is this film just so much worse?",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

How is it possible that the guy riding the bike can flip around and shoot at the Angels while standing on one hand? I was laughing when the bike race was happening.

That reviewer states some good points.Commenting that the movie lacks plot, is cliched, is 'over the top' is like complaining that a Shakespeare play is a lousy action movie; Charlie's Angels 2 is *meant* to be an over-the-top, outrageous, spoofing, comedical parody-type action movie. The characters don't just do action, they do ""over the top"" action. The stunts are not just amazing, they are ""over the top"". Part of the comedic elements are derived from characters doing *exagerrated* action sequences, thereby spoofing action movies. The movie broke out in a musical number during the High School reunion scene!! The movie is not *meant* to be a serious philosophical analysis of life!In my opinion, the movie was awesome. It had stunts, action, comedy, great acting (within the parameters of what the movie intended), great dialogue (again, within the parameters of what the movie intended) and moved at an excellent pace. The cameoes were the cherry on the sundae (although I dont know who ""Eve"" or ""Pink"" are....).IF you view the movie in the style it was intended to watch, this is an excellent movie (9.5 out of 10). If you view this movie too seriously (imagine watching  Leslie Neilson's Naked Gun movie with the mindset that you are watching a CSI movie), then you will be disappointed.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

145,SnobbyDude,I wish the creators of this movie had a physics class,2,15 June 2004,"I wish the creators of this movie had a physics class.  I can only suspend my disbelief so far.  I need some aspects of movies to be grounded in reality.  If the characters are going to defy laws of gravity, momentum, etc., and these characters aren't super heros, then I can't ""buy it"".Also, what's the deal with these 3 girls being unarmed?  Isn't having an action movie with no guns like having a football game with no football?  I have a feeling that some political correctness may have made it's way into the film and it makes it even more annoying.  I don't care how much training a person has.  If you show up at a gun fight with no weapons, you are finished, no matter how good your training is.
This movie reminded me of everything that was wrong with the Matrix sequels:* Over use of bullet time.  The first time it was used, it was interesting. Now it's boring.  Think of something new, Hollywood.* Poorly choreographed fight scenes.  The karate moves look really bad.  An old Bruce Lee movie shows how it should be done.* There is an overuse of CGI.  Because it doesn't always look real, it's distracting and prevents you from getting engrossed in the movie.* Action scenes that have no purpose.  The movie feels like a long fight scene and it seems like the ""plot"" only exists to set up more fight scenes.*Bad dialog!  The matrix sequels have the worst dialog in the history of movies, but the characters in this movie don't have anything interesting to say either.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

147,vicdragon19-1,its alright but over the top.....,6,3 May 2007,"Charlie's angels is more for TV than film. I mean, you have dance sequences that look really bad on film, then you have so many cameos that are of no relevance to the film (eve, and the Olsen twins.) I don't know how they come up with plots of these films, it obviously wasn't thought of very well. In this film, the three angels are off to find two rings that when combined, reveal a list of people who are under witness protection against crime figures. Then you add Demi Moore into the lot, a fantastic body in a bikini and acting that sometimes seems like she's forcing herself too much.The three angles have to stop her from releasing the list, and wolah! After one crazy scene flying off a building, Demi lands in her car while the angels happen to land it in too with just wires to support their landing...The film is too fast paced most of the time, while the first Charlie's angels had a more realistic and appropriate flow that made the film more interesting in a way. You could like the characters a bit more, while in this one you only see them without really feeling anything for them (which I suppose your not meant too anyway).Demi Moore is a good villain, and she has two golden guns which seem really huge. But she's barely in it! She comes up in a beach scene saying about 6 lines then she's off in a Ferrari. I mean, i know she needs a comeback in cinema but surely she can give more substance (though she does look gorgeous for a 40 year old) The film is fun sometimes, but the first one was way better.

OK, so the original TV series was kinda hoaky, but what do you expect from '70s TV, but this movie was an insult to my intelligence. Over blown special FX (ripped off from the Matrix), a foolish story, music video style cimematography, all combine for a seriously bad movie.

152,Erichnathanbennett,"Hot as hell, sexy as hell, pointless",5,26 January 2011,"This movie as I said before hot, sexy and pointless. Cameron Diaz which by the way she is in that stage of her life where she was actually hot; not like now where as I describe her as, ""I find her odd."" But I didn't like the pigtails style but still sexy as hell. Lucy Lui who is now in her 40's and is still hot. She was sexy as hell especially during that stripper scene, although they were all hot. And probably my favorite, Drew Barrymore. Put her with a leather jacket and a redhead, oh my god I want her so bad. Now the hotness of the girls distracts you from the pointlessness of the plot. The plot, the whole movie is pretty much pointless. One thing that is awkward about this movie is that you can't watch this alone because you'll look like a creep; and you could only watch this with a bunch of friends, the least two. And you can't own the DVD either because like I said before you can't watch this alone without looking like a freak, and you can't say to a bunch of your friends do you want to watch this. The only way you could successfully get this on DVD without looking like a freak is if a bunch of your friends and you want to rent it at Blockbusters. And by the way all this applies to the first movie too.But one thing I did appreciate about this movie is that it got a PG-13 rating and not R. If it were R then there would be a lot more sex and nudity which just doesn't fit Lucy Lui, Cameron Diaz, nor Drew Barrymore. It would ruin the teasing of the sexiness of these beautiful women. If there were sex and nudity this would just be a porn movie with actresses. So in the end this was a good movie, I guess.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, works in this movie, and nothing (again, NOTHING) is smart about this movie.  It is more highly contrived than most ""action"" flicks, the action looks almost entirely fake (which of course it is, but it should not make the audience so acutely and painfully aware of it!), the dialogue is somewhere between stupid and idiotic, and the humor is, shall we say, as funny as the old proverbial screen door in a submarine.  Directorially, it is pieced together like a series of very overstylized and mismatched music videos.

155,pip-7,Classic Movies + Charlie's Angel Movie = Complete Barf!,4,16 April 2006,"You all may be wondering how many kitsch movies you have watched in your entire life, not to mention how much hair you have pulled after cringing in every scene from the day you realized that popcorn movies are a mere imitation of a great (or two or more combined) classic movies which are MEANT not just to revolutionize the movie industry but to capture the hearts of the audience as well. But for those who just don't give a darn about quality and just slip in to watch it for guilty pleasure, just forget it.But for those who have admired legendary directors for forging classics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, The Sound of Music, etc, perhaps you should take a look at this piece of crap specially made for unfortunate audience who have no knowledge in SFX and elemental context whatsoever. Best (or worst, either way, you choose) of all, Charlie's Angel 2: Full Throttle (the sequel to the first movie starring Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz) is essentially a five, six movies in one package, completely wrecked during the delivery and all you get is a messy experience.It's as if director McG invited several Hollywood directors such as Steven Spielberg, the Wachowski Brothers, Tim Burton, James Cameron, Christopher Nolan etc. to shoot separate shots for him without even knowing what the heck is going on. As a result, the structure of the story seems incoherent and disjointed and it feels like a really bad music video (or perhaps a collection of professionally bad music videos), which serves no other purposes other than giving male viewers some wet dreams. Even the bad guys get progressively weirder like the crazy Irish dude who looks like Robbie Williams on a bad hair day and the Gothic, hair-obsessing vampire who seems to jump out of Tim Burton's mind and is completely off the plot. The only good stuff here (aside from fancy stunts and SFX, still I consider them kitsch) is the role of seductive criminal and former Angel Madison Lee, played by Demi Moore, in a classic rendition of the original TV series who uses GUNS instead of Woo-Ping's famous stylish patterns (which in fact has alienated the fans of the original in the first place). Too bad she is a bit of a Trinity rip-off, and it doesn't improve matters much later in the movie.Those who adore Bill Murray's role as Bosley will likely be surprised that he 'undergoes' a strange transformation into . . . a BLACK MAN? What a minute! What's going on around here? Why on earth does Bosley need to reincarnate in Full Throttle, as Lois Lane would do to become a black woman? (If you think I'm kidding, check out in the Internet) Okay, I'm just kidding here; Murray's been merely replaced by Bernie Mac (Momma Bosley's relationship with the white guy? Either I don't listen to the conversation or it is that Mac REALLY undergoes a plastic surgery) just to add spice to the already trite formula but unlike the lovable Murray, poor Mac seems to do nothing more than performing really bad SNL sketches every time he is given a task to help the Angels reach their goal.Once again, Full Throttle proves that, if you try to mangle the classic formula and modernize it to fit our generation's taste, you can only wish that you could endure hours and hours of pure brainwashing horror implied in thousand of kitsch movies before a REAL DARN GOOD AND ORIGINAL movie enters the scenery. . .",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
156,Spod-3,A live-action cartoon feature,3,18 June 2003,"This is the flip side of 'Toy Story' and ""Shrek'. Those were animated films with characters which looked and felt like real people. This movie has all the realism and excitement of a Road Runner cartoon.So much of the action is not at all live - I don't mind CGI in films but this is so obvious that many sequences look like a B-grade PC game. A l-o-n-g and tedious dirt-bike sequence has so many patently absurd 'movements' that you start to wonder if they even bothered to employ any stuntmen or just went straight from actors to sprites.I'm not sure if the director has done anything other than music videos, but he (or she, a name like McG gives nothing away) seems to have approached this as if it was just another one. Virtually every scene is filled with gratuitous music backing and some even have J-Lo style dance segments thrown in for some inexplicable reason.I guess the 'Angels' are not much worse than in the first film, but there are so many awful cameos by good actors who should know better. Demi Moore rolls out her evil-bitch ""Disclosure' persona, Bruce Willis could have been anyone else, and John Cleese takes on possibly the worst role of his career.For what it's worth, the plot looks dangerously like a Lord-of-the-Rings rip-off: two rings with names of witnesses in hiding have been stolen and the Angels have to get them back. This is the cue for lots of scenes that make any James Bond film look hyper-realistic.This film is a sort of modern-day 'Robot Monster'.

They jacked up the pace, loaded lame shtick in with a backhoe, abandoned all rules of movie action sequences, stripped the characters of any hint of reality and zeroed out any level of suspense.  It's a shame really.In this movie, the producers and director forget that the characters need a believable human side.  The fight scenes are not just over the top, but so far over the top that no Angel could actually survive them.  Once you make your lead characters virtually immortal, there is no suspense left.  In short, they went too far, and they don't work any more.  The drama is lost.

This is embarrassing. I feel so sorry for anyone, except McG, who worked on or appeared in the movie.Listen to what everyone is saying here. It's so bad, it is unredeemable.

From this point of view watching movies on PC certainly represents a huge progress.

Charlie's Angels are quire remarkable in this respect, the movie was shut down after 10 minutes of watching. I think no further description necessary, if there was a vote for the most stupid movie of all times, this could be a hot candidate(it is even a lot worse that Part 1 which at least managed to be funny at some points, but the in this one the gags are entirely lame).

I didn't bother seeing it in the cinema because i had better time during the summer Holidays, than to sit in a hot cinema, so i got it for Christmas. Oh how i wish i saw it at the cinema because now I'm stuck with this film for all eternity rotting under my big pile of DVDs under my shelf. Drew Barrymore who hasn't had a hit film for a while, perhaps made the biggest mistake of her career by starring in the worst sequel ever. Lucy Liu, shouldn't have done this straight after her amazing performance in Kill Bill, WHY LUCY WHY? Last but not least Cameron Diaz, Who like Drew hasn't had a decent film for a while, (not since the Mask in 1994 thats saying something) looks sexy as ever. The First film was great, it had what you wanted, sexy ladies, great acting, great effects and great villains and great supporting actors Matt Le Blanc (aka Joey) Tom Green and Tim Curry. But Full Throttle lacks that and has Bernie Mac, I give applause for Bill Murray for walking! *claps* Basically the Angels have to try and prevent Dylans (Barrymore) ex boyfriend from getting some silly rings because he plans to do something annoying with them, Suddenly an old Angel returns (Demi Moore) and has got plans for the girls that they don't expect, but its soooooooo obvious! Anyway..... we find out that Dylan was in the witness protection program and Shamus O'Grady (Lame Irish name) plans to Kill her for framing him! He should have killed everyone so that movie finished early. The Effects are lame, in the final scene when the Girls are fighting Demi. Demi Kicks Natalie (Diaz) very slightly and she goes flying across the screen, and its obvious shes being pulled by ropes. and the opening, Dylan is falling to her death and she manages to grab the plane wing and hold on? HOW? wouldn't she get sucked up into the turbines? as well as Alex (Liu)? While Cameron screams and Screams. MCG should be directing Bin Men, not a $50 million film! This money could have fed orphan's in Africa! Anyway...... This Movie was Evil and i felt like i wanted to Hunt down and kill McG and slap Barrymore, Diaz and Liu for being in this film, they are extremely talented and sexy and they should have left the first great film the way it was!.2/10, bad way for Demi to jump start her flagging career and this film nearly destroyed the careers for Cameron, Drew and Lucy!!

162,nickkulstadis,Abysmal sequel,1,25 August 2021,"Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is a bad movie with a boring plot, lame action scenes, a messy storyline and too much CGI and green screens in every action scene. This movie is a pathetic excuse of a movie. It's basically a bunch of campy scenes where the girls get into cheesy costumes stretched out to almost 2 hour. It adds to how messy the storyline already is to begin with. The first movie wasn't anything particularly good but it was fun. It was paced well and the storyline had a good flow. It was almost as long as this movie but it never felt longer than 1 hour. This movie feels like it's almost 2 and a half hours long. The pacing is glacial. This movie was so bad, it killed off the planned sequel because people hated this movie when it came out because it was such a let down after Charlie's Angels. The recent movie ended up mostly ignoring this movie. Too bad it was bad in a different way. Not even Bernie Mac was able to salvage this dreck. He's given such bad material to work with that it zaps any opportunity for him to put his comedic talents to work and he's given practically nothing to do except act as the comedic relief in an already overly ridiculous movie. John Cleese is also in this movie for some reason. He does practically nothing but show up and listen to a story by Matt Leblancs character with a flabbergasted look on his face. Maybe he was perplexed as to why he signed on to such an awful movie.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
163,moviestar26,High octane action in MTV style,6,6 January 2010,"The Angels are back after the hugely hyped 'Charlie's Angels' from 2000. McG directs his grand style. In comparison to the prior movie this time there is more emphasis towards the action sequences. The realism is actually lacking due to the imagination put in to full force which is incorporated. If these action sequences were to be taken out, not much in the movie would be left to be desired. However I give full credit to the special effects and computer graphics department for creating the variety of impossible situations. The movie is clearly aimed towards the young generation. This is evident from the MTV look that has been given throughout most of the portions of the movie. Action movies are not one of my favourite genres but I do have to admit that I quiet enjoyed what I saw. Initially it was difficult to adapt my mind and emotions to viewing mindless action. But once I was inclined to it, it was a riveting experience. One tends to eagerly await for one action scene to the next. McG has used his own directing style which is very similar to how a music video would be shot. The individual has received more recognition for being a writer rather than being in the directors chair. The appeal of the movie is very reminiscent to 'Bad Boys 2'. But similarities end there. I perceive this movie as more of a action flick rather than a mystery. The story revolves mainly around 2 titanium rings which contain the profiles of people with new identities that are on the federal witness protection programme. Both have been stolen and the angels have been assigned the mission to retrieve them at whatever cost. The methods include taking up the usual disguises and facing life risking situations. The first scene is akin to the parody of 'james bond'. Robert Patrik is freed from some Hungarian hostages after one ring is stolen. The clues they discover leads them from one character to the next. This brings them face to face with Demi Moore (ex angel), who is in possession of the rings and is hell bent on selling it to any criminal connections for a high bidded price. The movie has its fair share of comedy speed breakers which at a few times disturb the decent pace of the movie. Bernie Mac is irritating to the core. I did not find him to be funny. I only wished they kept Bill Murray. The movie has many highlights. The bike racing scene and the climax on the rooftop were the highly enjoyable moments in the movie. Yet some scenes seemed ridiculously impossible and unrealistic. But those are the elements that my make the movie exciting for a few to watch. The humour and wit is very much contained in the dialogues. The interactions between Drew, Cameron and Lucy is pure chemistry. All three of them performed to the best of their abilities. However I was slightly disappointed with Lucy Liu's involvement. She seemed to not have much focus in the movie. Tia Carrera would have been a better replacement. That is my opinion. The pace of the movie is perfect. Upon viewing I found the first 40 minutes ot being rather unproductive. Since their was not much development plot wise. After that point it was pretty straightforward and more interesting. Many good song numbers are incorporated in to the scenes which compliment them very well. It enhance the viewing pleasure. The John Cleese track seemed forced in to the narrative and it appeared vague and irrelevant to the plot.In regards to the performances, Cameron Diaz overshadows the other two girls. She was awesome and funny at the same time. Drew Barrymore gave good support and her outfits suited her well. Demi Moore is surprising as the bad woman. She really worked her body well for the role. Overall in comparison to the first movie, this is high on style but low on substance. But not a disappointment.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
164,DarkLugia1969,Movie Is Beyond Full Throttle,9,24 July 2003,"-Note: This comment may contain spoilers so you have been warned-I was very impressed with this sequel to the first movie.  If you love the Angels' as well as action and excitement don't look know further and go see this movie.The movie has so many good things like comedy with the Angels (Liu, Barrymore and Diaz) as well as Bernie Mac.  With special cameos of Bruce Willis and Eve this movie says it all.  The Angels fight against one of their very own Madison Lee(Demi Moore),a former Angel.  The special effect just like the first movie was much more ""hardcore"" in the second movie. Personally, depending on the outcome of the box office receipt (and whether the three Angels will work for a possible third movie) remains to be seen. 
The Dark Gengar gives this excellent movie from one Gengar to Ten Gengars: Nine Gengars and the soundtrack is very impressive.  Aloha and enjoy the movies.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
165,24540647,"Oh dear, What can the matter be...?",3,26 July 2003,"This is a perfect example of big stars, big budget and big explosions not being able to deflect attention from an absolutely terrible script.Two rings are stolen which, when put together, show all the relocated people in the Witness Protection Plan.  The Angels job is to get them back before the information is sold to an underworld organization.The plot sounds quite good, but from the opening with the ridiculous helicopter stunt the film goes downhill fast.  The absence of Bill Murrey isn't explained at all, simply that his 'brother' is there to take over, and he is seriously missed, as his replacement seems to be merely a black stereotype stooge.It's a shame to see Demi Moore come out of 'retirement' as she is one of these people that, with the possible exception of Ghost, hasn't been able to act in any movie she's made.  And this is no exception.The script is lame, and the amusing one-liners few and far between.  Many more just don't work.  The amount of 'incredible' stunts the Angels pull off (like the grinding of the ship hawsers on planks) are just too unbelievable to be taken seriously, and there is far too much use of the 'Matrix' type camera work.As for plot lines, the 'surprise' of Dylan not being Dylan, but a witness on the program just really stinks.  There is no sense of urgency.  Whenever a problem crops up, someone immediately has an answer.I rated the first film as a 7, but this one barely scrapped a 4, and that's mainly due to Drew, Lucy and Cameron's looks and acting ability.Wait till video if you have to pay at the cinema and save some money.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Oh, and maybe half-a-point for Demi Moore lookin' fine in a black bikini.  Well, now that we've taken care of the eye candy attractions...I honestly can't begin to describe how pathetic the script, the acting, the plot, and the plausibility truly are.  Suffice to say that this cartoon makes every Batman movie and every James Bondmovie you've ever watched seem completely believable by comparison.  EvenJason Voorhees would have died in some of these situations...but not ourAngels!  This piece of celluloid tripe can't decide whether it wants to be acomedy, an action movie, a spoof, an homage to 70's TV shows or just a 90minute rock video.

It's easily the fasted-paced movie I've ever seen, with each scene crammed to the gills with as much action, skimpy outfits, and humor as possible.  In a normal movie, the action scenes are interrupted with at least OCCASIONAL scenes of relative calm...not in this flick.  Every moment has something loud going on.  What makes this work is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and the humor is actually funny...making all the ridiculous action much more entertaining than, say, in ""2 Fast 2 Furious.""  ""2 Fast"" failed because the characters were annoying and the film tried to present them as real.  ""Full Throttle"" keeps its tongue planted firmly in cheek, never once even attempting realism, and is massively entertaining.  In many ways, ""Full Throttle"" is the exact opposite of the ponderous ""Hulk,"" which was more interested in giving a psychology lecture than entertainment. 
Now, I'm not saying ""Full Throttle"" is a great movie.  But unlike the other so-called ""summer movies"" so far, this one is actually entertaining.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Fun science-fiction action, humour and sex-appeal... Well, a very delicious cocktail. But contrary as the first, the sequel lose some of its freshness... McG, the director, uses the same formula : very cool music to support very cool images but it's like watching the same movie we saw two years ago.The cool things is there are a lot of cameos on it like Bruce Willis, Robert Patrick, John Cleese, etc... and a very good surprise by the presence of one of the ""original"" angel!And the very one person that lift the movie up is Demi Moore! After too much bad movies, she's coming back more beautiful than ever and in great shape for a great villain character! Too bad that the filmakers doesn't use her much more. We knew that she was the lost angel before the film was out and she didn't get into the action before the very last finale!

It is so buggy that I wonder if somebody actually proof-read its script. (I am not gonna spoil anything but I'd say that skilled people will at a moment or another be in difficulty as if they never had the required capability which we however see them demonstrating previously).

Drew, Lucy, and Cameron were absolutely gorgous in Full Throttle. They were on fire! The visual effects were great too, but they took too much from other great action movies(ie. The Matrix, The Fast and the Furious, and of course the sequals to these.) This movie wasn't the greatest, but it was definately entertaining and more big hearted then most. it was different in the fact that females dominated this in both intellect and strength and i liked that. it's like watching three female James bonds that each have there own individual style, which separates them from 007 completely actually.Both men and women alike will have good reasons for enjoying this Charlie's Angels installment",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

I was wrong.I spent the next tortured minutes (however there might be of it) begging it to get better. This plea fell on deaf ears. There seemed to be at least half a dozen plots, with the most tenuous (forced) connection, and scenes that made the original television series look like something on PBS.Was it meant to be a parody? A comedy? A serious remake? It was a half a dozen plots jumbled together, and they were badly written, badly acted, saving John Cleese, who was clearly the best actor there. Had his and his daughter's relationship been the central part of the plot, I think it might have saved the whole thing. But it wasn't, and it didn't.I kept exclaiming ""It can't get any worse..."" but it did. Repeatedly.I've seen some bad films, ""Moulin Rouge"",""Interstellar"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" ""Christopher Columbus : The Discovery"" (a film so bad, and so historically inaccurate, that I walked out, I would have walked out of ""Moulin Rouge"" but I was on a date), but ""Charlie's Angels : Full Throttle"" leaves them all in the dust.

Easily, this is one of the worst blockbusters ever made, and one of the most unbearable pieces of garbage released by a major Hollywood studio.It's understandable that the core audience for this movie is almost exclusively teenagers, but the flick lowers every standard to such low levels that it becomes a joke. The producers may keep justifying this mess with the good old ""it's just camp,"" or ""it's just fun."" Whatever; it doesn't fly. The movie is an insult to anyone with an IQ over 80. Namely:The Charlie's Angels can fly through the air, jump away from explosions every 10 minutes, and defy gravity on a constant basis for no reason at all. It's only funny the first twelve times...The paper-thin plot is laughable, replaced with an overwhelming amount of ""Matrix-like"" CGI effects displaying the girls dodging bullets in the air in slow motion. This is done so many times during the movie that it makes you hope nobody uses this effect ever again in a movie. Ever!Characters, all of the sudden, develop the ability to fly (Demi Moore).Characters, all of the sudden and without much explanation, go from being ""bad: to being ""good"" (Thin Man), and from being ""good"" to being ""bad"" (Demi Moore, Robert Patrick).The jokes are lame, unfunny, and worst of all, rehashed straight off the first movie. John Cleese should fire his agent for getting him into this mess.Bernie Mac. Why, oh why?Did I mention the girls constantly fly away from explosions, and defy any law of physics with no apparent explanation (mind you, these Angels do not live inside the Matrix.)With the overblown production budget of this horrendous flick, you could produce five or six half-decent movies.

If you go without any expectations beyond this then you will be fine. If you go expecting Citizen Kane you won't. This movie is pure fun, you watch as the Angels go from one strange set to another, and one fantastic costume to another. They are having fun doing it, have fun watching it.

Elaborate setups are made for minor plot points, and in some instances, there are shots that don't seem to have any connection whatsoever to what's going on.

The plot was pathetic as Drew Barrymore's character is actually named Helen Zaas (yea, funny 5th grade humor) who entered the witness protection program to escape a creepy boyfriend. Shia LaBeouf, though a great person to have in a movie, is in the movie for almost no reason at all, and Bosley doesn't do much except come in every now and then and yell out loud, humorous, lines. Cameron Diaz seems to have become more ditzy as well.There's even more confusion as the Creepy Thin Man enters again and by the end, the viewer still has no idea where he stands on the good/evil spectrum. Demi Moore's character is even more pathetic as she plays a ""fallen angel"". Someone who used to work for Charles Townsend. Her plots for revenge are ridiculous and the angels themselves seem to have no spark left. No wit or intelligence they showed in the previous movie, all they seem to be able to do is kick some asses, pull off a nun look, and act even more slutty all at once!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

185,JesperT,Charlie's Spiderwomen?,1,25 October 2004,"What a waste of time. The first ""Charlie's Angels"" movie was not my cup of tea, but I actually liked the series. But let us not forget that this was a time when ""Loveboat"" and ""Family Ties"" were considered high-speed entertainment...""Full Throttle"" is not even at their level when it comes to the jokes, and far below them when it comes to acting.I never liked Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu as actresses, and Drew Barrymore has always annoyed me. I only ever liked her in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" where she surprised me positively - but with focus on stunts and a ridiculous plot (if there is one at all) she does not get a chance to show that she can actually act. In ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" she actually plays opposite Sam Rockwell who also has a major role in the first Charlie's Angels.The ""women kick serious behind"" thing that apparently is part of the the concept is just plain pathetic.Especially the ending scene where the 3 heroines fly around like 3 Spiderwomen chasing the flying Demi Moore is pityful, and is far away from the spirit of the TV series, which I think at least the first movie managed to capture somewhat better.Maybe that was never the intention, but then again, I don't think it was ever the intention that I had to watch the movie. I wish I hadn't.Only positive aspect: the soundtrack.I give it...a 1. I was debating whether I should give it a 2 for the soundtrack + it is afterall still not the worst movie of all time.

I have no doubt it'll spin in DVD players for years to come. But don't go near it if you want to use that soft matter between your ears and behind your eyes. The problem with all the people slagging the film? They don't remember the utter fromage of the original TV series -- much like Mission: Impossible 2 (which Full Throttle takes the p*ss out of with a Cruise-esque movie premiere ending), the second Charlie's Angels film GETS IT. It's not about plot, or thought, or a script that makes a modicum of sense. It's about T, and A, and slo-motion karate kicks with landings on three-inch heels.Cameron Diaz remains the hottest piece of ass in mainstream Hollywood, and Lucy Liu 'n' Drew Barrymore do a helluva job keeping up with her in the Holy Spit She Looks Good department. Bruce Willis, Matt Leblanc, John Cleese, Bernie Mac, Pink, Jaclyn Smith, Robert Patrick the twins Olsen and the brothers Wilson all make melodramatic, over-the-top or flat out cheesy appearances. Mac can't possibly live up to Bill Murray's turn as Bosley from the first film, but he does utter one decent line between desperate attempts to be funny. A convoluted side story telling us the title of ""Bosley"" is bestowed by chance, rather than by birth, gives hope Mac won't be in CA3. We also get a glimpse of what the franchise will look like once one or two of the Angels fail to reach a rich enough contract.Best of all the cameos and guest spots is Demi Moore, who plays -- you guessed it -- the Fallen Angel. She's anything but, looking nearly as good as Diaz in a bikini, lingerie, and anything else that would look horrible on anyone without a Tinseltown-financed personal trainer and 24-hours-a-day makeup consultant. Usually, I'm a stickler for a plot and decent dialogue. But Charlie's Angels succeeds where, say, Matrix: Reloaded fails -- it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it lets the audience have a blast with the eye and ear candy. Let's hope Cameron gets to wiggle the aforementioned ass in the third Matrix film -- at least it'll be fun.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The plot, such as it was, had something to do with the women trying to recover two rings containing the names of people in the Witness Protection Program. The film contained lots of action and lots of wardrobe changes for the leads but who cares? And Bernie Mac, who is usually funny, just stank up every scene he was in. (Nothing wrong with having an African American ""Bosley,"" but give him some decent material.) The action scenes were so preposterous that they made me roll my eyes.

189,descendent528,Reinventing the T&A Action/Comedy,5,27 June 2003,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is pretty much exactly what I expected. It had it's ups and downs, highs and lows, and really really cheeseball moments that just make you groan. Actually, the picture wasn't that bad and I enjoyed it with the exception of the predictible plot and the cop out ending.The trailer for this flick is nice looking, you know, the one with ""My Sharona"" playing in the background, yet totally ruins it, like most trailers these days. It gives too much away. If I was making this film, which I wasn't and of course, my opinion doesn't matter one bit, but I would have kept the whole Demi Moore involvement a little bit of a secret. For instance, you see shots of a long haired woman with golden guns being all nasty and evil. But I saw this in the trailer, and I already know that it's Demi Moore, bad. Surprise for me (Spoiler) it was funny to see her whack Bruce Willis, I got a kick out of that one.Acting-wise, I wasn't expecting much. Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are two that I have never really been to see as, say, good actresses. Of course, my opinion again. Lucy Liu I liked though, I thought she far surpassed Cameron, Drew, and Demi. Going into this flick, I did remember that Justin Theroux played ""some Irish dude"" and I was pretty excited because the last thing I saw him in was ""Mulholland Dr."" and I thought he was spectacular in that, and that is one of my favorite movies so yeah, he was awesome in this as I had expected. It was actually kind of comical though. He talks with the mad Irish accent, his name is Seamus, he has a whacked out faux-hawk, walks through fire, and (spoiler) lands on Crispin Glover's stabbed up carcass in the end, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! Onto Bernie Mac. I was really hoping that they would play it off like Bernie was the same Bosley as Bill Murray, but ofcourse, they didn't. I was really hoping for that, let down, but Bernie did great anyway. So was John Cleese. Gotta love John Cleese.Digressing to the director McG or whatever his name is. The downfall to having a music video director work on a major motion picture is that he will get all of his popstar buddies to do cameos in his movie. Actually, I only saw Pink and her motocross buddies, and that's all I can remember right now. Also, endorsements. The biggest sign I saw was an ad for Cingulair, who have kindly paid mad bucks to bring you this...movie. Direction was sound, but I don't know if anyone could have turned the awful script into anything better. The jokes were tired and lame (i.e. John Cleese as Lucy Lui's character's(either Alex or Alice I heard both) father believing that she is a prostitute) and a lot of the action sequences were literally, unbelieveable, as in, could never happen in real life, and they won't because this is the movies and what happens here does not have to make sense. It's an action/comedy with lots of T&A so it is sure to be a blockbuster. Kudos to all of the suckers in suits making some big bank off of this one.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
190,nochturne,Hilarious!!!!,10,27 June 2003,"This movie was great fun! From the opening scenes where the angels appear to rescue a man from what appears to be Jabba the Hut's palace to watching the angels strip to the Pink Panther theme- ok, they didn't really strip, just dance- this is one of the funnier movies I have seen in a while.  Honestly, having just seen the Matrix sequel and the Hulk, I have to say that while the action in Angels II is completely unrealistic, the visual effects were by far more convincing, realistic *looking* (although physically impossible) and *entertaining*.  No, really, where Neo looked like gumby during his scenes, the angels look amazing. And of course half the time you will lean over to your friend and say ""yeah, right!"". But you'll be so busy laughing you won't really mind. I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously. This movie is a great example of a fun movie. Definately one to go see in the theater. Enjoy!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
191,jmm509,Wasteful and non-addictive!,3,30 June 2003,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle-* We see all three cast members return from the original movie.  Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Alex(Lucy Liu), Dillian ( Drew Barrymore) try to recover two stolen rings which were going to be used for something, I'm still not even sure about.  The new and beautiful villian ( Demi Moore) is a fallen angel and is desperate for the two other rings.  We also see another new character Bernie Mac who plays Bosleys brother and is also named Bosley.  As the movie is filled with a number of stunts which are not even believeable.  Cameos filled with peoples like the Olson twins and Bruce Willis.  While we sit and try to understand this difficult plot which doesnt even seem to interest us. As we sit what they called bullet-time in the movie the Matrix, they seem to be doing something along the same thing. Also once we know the movie is going to be a complete waste of our time and so they try to trust and get us to like the movie by dressing in skanky outfits and to try to addict the male audience. I only gave the movie a star for the role of Bernie Mac who perhaps gave me only a chuckle. You might think this movie is better than the first, but the truth of the matter is that the movie is completly stupid and which only gives more temerity toward the movie.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

How could one not have fun with a cast of sexy, funny women; tons of small roles and cameo appearances that don't disappoint; Crispin Glover, hamming it up as a super freak; and Bernie Mac as Bill Murray's brother. The plot is nonexistent and the action sequences are totally unbelievable. So what. That's not what you're here for. You're here to have a good time.

This movie is relentless fun, and if you can't enjoy it, I don't know what to tell you. The ladies are just as energetic as last time, as is the vibe of the movie. The costumes, set designs, cars, locales, everything is just so hyped up, it becomes like a new genre, non-stop action squared, or something like that. All the little character moments and vignettes are great, too, and a lot of care is often put into something you'll only see for two or three seconds, so please-don't-blink. McG doesn't hold back, and Full Throttle feels more like a live-action comic book than some of those other comic book movies out around this time of year. Tell your family and friends to see this; it won't hurt them, or at least it SHOULDN'T. I don't know; the truth some people can't handle a good time. This movie is not for them.

The acting was excellent and I laughed all the way through it. I could see these woman were having a blast.

Did they not see the first movie? Or perhaps they thought the original TV show was a cerebral example of 1970's TV programming.The fact is if you liked the 2000 movie, with all the silly in-jokes, cultural references, campy soundtrack and frankly ridiculous stunts then you'll enjoy this one just as much.

I mean, it's sort of one of those tongue-in-cheek things - you're just meant to sit back and enjoy it. And I enjoyed it far more than, for example, Austin Powers 2 and 3 - #2 was just survivable but I did not like #3.I'm certainly not really expecting this movie to get any Oscars - but there's a difference between enjoyment level and art.

I wish that I felt that this was as good as the first movie or even the series but it's not. I would have hated to have paid to get in the theater on this one.

203,Juansmith,Overly episodic and poorly conceived,5,3 July 2003,"(minor spoilers ahead) Why, oh why, could they not remember the spirit of the first? As sequels go, this one reminds me of Mission: Impossible 2. In the first M:I flick, they conceived a poignant story of IMF agents working together toward a common covert goal of some kind. In the sequel, it was Tom Cruise as a one-man killing machine. He didn't need any help, so it wasn't a Mission Impossible story at all. It was a shaky attempt at a Bond knockoff.The appeal of the first ""Charlie's Angels"" flick was in its complete lack of attempts to take itself seriously. The Angels' world seemed to be a fanciful place, full of whimsy and fantastical things; almost a fairy tale. It was this ever-present ""giddiness"" that made the first film so enjoyable. It was clear from all three stars' performances that they were having a great time making the film. While this attitude, as well as the film's fanciful spirit, was still somewhat present in the sequel, the story simply did not flow quite as well.From each over-the-top action scene to the next, there seemed to be little or no connection. The overly episodic feel left the audience wondering if they should expect a commercial break before the next location. The FX were quite impressive, although some scenes; particularly a dirt bike race/shootout, felt so fake that I wondered where my game controller was so I could pause the movie and check how many lives the Angels had left.Bernie Mac, while typically an amusing addition (such as in `Ocean's 11'), was sadly reduced to just a few one-liners in this film. While it's debatable whether Bill Murray would've done any better (as he did in the first film) within the parameters of this story, let's just say he couldn't do any worse.Demi Moore was impressive, but overly serious, and Crispin Glover was wasted in just a few confusing appearances. McG would get along quite nicely with Rob Cohen, but will hopefully prove himself more versatile in the future. For once, a film is faulted by not being nearly campy enough. As much as I enjoyed the first film, It's time for this franchise to slip away quietly, rather than with a loud crash when Charlie's Angels 3 comes out.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

You just sit there smiling and you completely forget about the paperthin plot. Who cares? Certainly not me! I knew what was to be expected and McG delivered.

There is quite a bit of comedy, I laughed at the dirt bike race when Lucy Liu was like 'no, uh-uh' to that one guy who was bugging her. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and the special effects are over the top, especially the dirt bike scenes! Rent this movie and see how many of the cameos you can pick out (PS where are the Olsen twins in the cameo-graphy?).

It was fun to watch the angels hang out, wear nice outfits, kick some bad guy ass and all. While others may find this makes the movie stupid, it can be a good show just for some light viewing.However, most of the fight scenes were overly unrealistic. In quite impossible situations, the angels manage to survive while battling in 4-inch heels and miniskirts. Of course, they never get the slightest bit injured until the end of the entire film. This total lack of realism and suspense was a bit annoying, even when I was just watching the DVD to keep me busy while I waited for the water to boil to cook some noodles.Still, I thought the lighthearted parts of the movie were very fun.

The 'plot' (*Possible SPOILERS**), about a powerful ring that could fall into the wrong hands ( now where have I heard that before? ), is wafer thin. The celebrity cameos are tedious and unnessescary, and even Matt LeBlanc looks embarassed to be there, if you can believe THAT!Avoid this film like the Black Death, unless you enjoy lessons in pain ( oh, I've just been reminded about that Robbie Williams lookalike: the worst Irish accent ever heard - but that's in keeping with this film ).

217,jack_horner01,Prime example of the state Hollywood is in,3,12 July 2003,"When you go to see Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, be prepared to have part of your brain rot away. This has got to be one of the most demeaning films i have ever had the displeasure of watching.Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against silly films, but only when there is something else to make up for it. Spy Kids is OTT, but it has reasonable action, funny gags, and it works in the world it sets. Old Sckool is cliched, but it is hilarious, and has some of the funniest moments to grace the screen in years. CA:FT has nothing going for it. The plot stinks, the action looks like a small child choreographed it, the acting is the hight of poor, the jokes are about as funny as watching grass grow, and there seems to be no sense of time.For some unknown reason. The Angels are able to change costume instantly, they can defy the laws of both physics and gravity. They seem to be super human. And to all of this, not a single one of them is good looking. Demi Moore is the only female in the cast that looks bedable. I am not saying that the cast have to look attractive for the film to be any good, but if you are going to hype the characters to be godesses, then at least make them look half decent.From an objective POV, you could see this film stinking from a mile off. What studio in there right mind, would trust a film to a guy who calls himself Mc G!? That name just speaks for itself. I honestly believe that guys like this make a mockery of film. People with real talent and vision spend their whole lives working very hard, striving to become directors, only to lose out to complete fools like Mc G. I think it is not only a shambles, but an embarrasment to the film industry. They have finally done it. Hollywood has finally killed the medium of film.Let us hope that a ray can be found at the end of the tunnel. Otherwise cinemas will shortly have nothing to offer but films by guys with appreviated names about absolutely nothing. Audiences will become mindless idiots, as they are sat for 90 minutes and watching complete drivel. Attentions spans will reach an all time low, and soon fights will errupt for no reason. Entire cities will fight against their neighbours. Countries will fight each other, and an apocalypse will shortly follow. All this because a guy named Mc G decided he would make the most horrifically poor film he could.The only reason i gave this film some merit was because they actually managed to string together a beginning, middle and end.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Minor Spoilers!!The film centers around a government witness protection act with the witness making reports about crimes and then being bumped off by several killers, one in particular doesn't show their true colours until the second half of the film!There is also a purpose of charlie's angels to get and keep hold of two precious rings that everyone seems to want End Of Spoilers!! One of my favourite things about Charlies Angel's is that the film mixes Comedy with Action and Suspense well and is always constantly exciting to watch and see what happens next, there are lots of funny one liners and cameo appearances from other celebrities. It was also excellent to see actress Demi Moore in her first major feature film for 6 years and back to providing a film with a brilliant and memorable performance. The other actresses Cameron Diaz,Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu also provide the film with talented acting,humour and some outrageous stunts.

224,Sleel,Almost unwatchable,3,13 July 2003,"The plot (what there was of it) was trying to go in multiple directions at the same time. The comedy made use of hackneyed and offensive stereotypes (barbarous Mongolians, dumb blacks) or smirky in-jokes about the girls, who have a whopping one film history together, which is not nearly enough for self-referential humor.The action scenes were horrible distortions of reality. I mean, I can suspend disbelief for most movies, but villains who can fly simply by wearing a dress with big sleeves and a full skirt, people dodging bullets by flipping away from them, a full-speed car crash (including ejection from the crash) with only a couple of scrapes to show for it, and girls jump-kicking guys who mass twice what they do  to project them 5 to 10 meters away and then landing in the exact same spot they jumped from is a little too much. Being bludgeoned by such blatant unreality doesn't produce suspense or even ""kewlnis"", it produces laughter.If this movie had for one second taken itself even a little bit seriously, it would have been unwatchable. The only thing that made it tolerable was that everyone involved treated the movie as one big joke. The only real humor of the movie -as opposed to a gag or the hilariously bad special effects- was the dialog sequence with Matt LeBlanc and John Cleese, where a mistaken premise by Cleese makes LeBlanc's ""innocent"" remarks have a double meaning. I suspect that dialog was written by Cleese as it seems to have some of the hallmarks of his style.If you want to see a stupid ""action"" movie, with indestructible heroines and yet more effects-enhanced extreme sports crap thrown in to appeal to those who actually care, this is the movie for you. If you want real humor, a plot, excitement, thrills, or anything that will engage more brain cells than necessary to make your eyes track movement, see something else. It's a slightly entertaining movie that misses getting a vote of two only by virtue of its not pretending to be more than it is; dumb entertainment. 3/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

But when I watch a Movie Iwant to be entertained by the story and the plot as well as thescenery. To me this was a way for Demi Moore to show off hernew body. It was like Charlie's Angels meets the Matrix it wasoverdone and unbelievable. The story itself was flimsy at best. Ienjoy looking at beautiful women as much as the next guy but atleast let it be in an entertaining way. I mean it is as if the said let'ssee how many times can we use our new special effects technology and get away with it. Overall I would call it beautifulwomen in tight skimpy clothes with Charlie's Angels as a subplot.Icertainly hope this is the last of Charlie's Angels.

228,Dimme,Strong contender for worst movie ever made,1,8 April 2004,"Director McG sure know how to shoot a slick scene. He just doesn't understand why. This movie (and I'm using the term loosely) is entertainment for and by people with attention deficit syndrome.Directed as a never ending pop video it's the movie substitute for lying on the couch watching MTV.The pop music drones in the background every second of the movie as gorgeous babes kick ass i slow motion. It's Bay Watch with a budget.Plot, development, build-up and dialog are elements usually found in most movies. They are as alien to this flick as it is devoid of entertainment value. Incoherent, badly edited action sequences tied together with awkward one-liners as substitute for dialog constitutes what can be called the ""structure"" of this movie. That is, to the extent this movie has any structure. It is a celebration of the end of cinema.Not stylish but vulgar. Not entertaining but embarrassing. Not fun but sad.
Star studded as any action flick I've ever seen, it was fascinating for me to watch the extent and speed that this move wastes and disposes talent. Anybody who appears on screen in this stinker should be ashamed of themselves. Kudos to the producers for coating pure sh**e with enough sugar so that mindless teenagers will suck it down without noticing it's real taste.I weep for this movie.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
229,shadowed_vandread,Demi Moore ROCKED!,8,27 June 2003,"She was the best thing the movie had to offer. Lucy Liu wasn't bad, but Demi Moore was great! The movie had a predictable storyline but was still entertaining. Crispin Glover's return was surprising, I wished he didn't die. Someone who didn't have to be on the show, Shia LeBouf(or something like that), why the hell did they add that to the show, and even if they had to, why him? My brother watches his show and the bike part add-on was kinda dumb. Helen Sass(Izzit like tt? The name couldn't be Helen's ass) part was interesting. The way Demi Moore died was stupid, and if only she could live on like the Creepy Thin Man. Bernie Mac was good, but Bill Murray(if returned) would be better i think. I agree with the user who said that the identity of the villain should have been kept secret. The Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen part with Eve was hilarious. The cameo by Bruce Willis was shocking, and I wasn't sure who whacked him, I thought it was Demi Moore's assassins. But come to think of it, it would be funny if it was Demi Moore.
Think about this, how many more tickets would be sold if there were The Hours: Full Throttle, Far From Heaven: Full Throttle.(Both my favourites) It's a dumb suggestion, but I'm only 13, understand my lousy comment.Rating: 7.7/10 (Entertaining)",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

There is not one moment where I sat through this crap that I did not want to vomit.  I was forced to see it with my Girlfriend, and I damn near broke up with her for making me watch this fecal matter.  Demi Moore should have picked a better movie as her comeback movie because this movie is a waste of her talent and the talent the other girls as well.  I am sure, however that all they were thinking about was a pay check.  Cameron Diaz is a far better actress than this and to go from Gangs of New York to this is sacrilege!

It's hard to believe that they couldn't find solid comedic writers to make Bernie Mac and John Cleese do their thing. Justin, Shia, Crispin and Demi were so under utilized and this sophomore effort shows that no effort was put into creating a story that not only lets these two stars shine but also the rest of the cast as well.

233,ShadowDragyn,"Its defenders define it as ""spoof"", but it's much closer to ""spoor"".",2,2 August 2004,"I am a fan of mindless action and horror movies. I have titles in my collection that most people groan at when browsing my shelves. I think it's fair to say that I have a rather large appreciation for movies whose sole purpose is to provide a ""plot"" only as a vehicle to present action. Because of this, I have defended numerous films to my friends over the years which they are determined to make me hate.Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is not one of them.Over-the-top action is terrific when done right, and just plain bad when done wrong. This movie is a classic example of how not to do it. I'm all for checking my brain at the door and just having a good time, but when a movie is totally devoid of anything resembling a brain, when it's just flat *stupid*, I have to cry uncle.This movie, like the recently unleashed-on-an-unsuspecting-public debacle that is Catwoman, has some people campaigning for it because it presents women in a strong, hero-type role. But what good does it do to take two steps forward and three back? Sure, these girls kick ass (in the most ridiculous of ways, but that's neither here nor there), but they also reduce themselves to sex objects every chance they get. It's nothing but exploitation without the fleshy payoff. Is that the sort of role model that feminists really want to see? Films like The Long Kiss Goodnight present a much more believable female action figure without reverting her every 5 minutes to a walking Viagra advertisement.Luckily I caught it on cable. If I'd paid money for this, even as a rental, I'd likely have wasted even more of my life trying to get my stolen money back in small claims court. Maybe theaters should be able to get refunds for stuff like this. Perhaps, were that the case, Hollywood might think twice about damaging our psyches every summer.2/10 just because the four female stars are so damn easy on the eyes.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The storyline was as follows: Angels beating up guys, shots of their nearly nude bodies, excessive bullet-time and over done action scenes, repeat 1000 times. I'm sorry if I spoiled the movie for everyone who read this.

HOWEVER, if you are looking for a fun, mindless diversion, this is it. The plot never really makes sense, and has vaguely to do with rings containing the location of people in the Witness Protection Program. Demi Moore also pops up as a former Angel-turned-villian. Mostly the movie is just about the Angels looking beautiful and beating up on the bad guys.
""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" is not a thought-provoking journey into the human pysche. It's just a fun action flick about three hot girls who can beat up a room full of armed men without ruining their hair and makeup. It never tries to be deep, and it is exactly what it seems to be: the cartoon-like adventures of the gorgeous Angels. Logical? Well, definetely not. Fun? Very much so!

Just imagine that Bruce Willis is cast as a guy who dies within 20 seconds of his appearance. Can a movie with that kinda luxury still suck? Yes, it can. Full Throttle is boring because the storyline fails. It is not exciting, I didn't care at any point what happened.

241,pipsapauliina,Crispy freak -giving a spark to the taste,7,15 October 2003,"Yeah, yeah, yeah: Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is predictable, dull, filled with tits and buts, blaablaablaa. Most people seem to think so in here. Well, I don't say that the film was very unusual and pure art, but it was good entertainment... or at least I think so.One of the comments here pointed out Crispin Glovers ""useless"" character ""Thin man"". Well, he was one of my favorites in the film. Somehow it gives something weird to this easy-plotted movie. Creepy Thin Man is great. The man doesn't talk, he mostly smokes and in the tough situations he takes his sword. Simple, but effective. A man that actually doesn't do pretty much anything is refreshing! Everyone else is doing something for a reason: trying to kill the good guys or try to prevent the bad guy killing the good guys. How predictable, how old situation. But suddenly a man with a cigarette and a cane arrives and the movie gets some unpredictable action and excitement in it.This movie was very smoothly done. Everything was okay. But.... that was also the problem: the plot was very usual, too ""smooth"". Nothing rocky, except the Creepy Thin Man. I liked this though I also prefer ""intellectual"" movies. I guess I was having a right mood for this. And... I must still point out: Crispin Glover's ""meaningless"" role meant a lot to me. A little bit of magic maybe...

243,mnemosyne23,"Fluffy Summer Fun - Don't Expect ""Hamlet""",8,1 July 2003,"""Charlie's Angels II: Full Throttle"" is exactly what the trailers make it out to be: mindless summer fun, full of eye candy and vibrant color.  If you go into this film expecting a sequel of ""X2"" or ""Empire Strikes Back"" quality, you're going to go home crying and shaken to the core.  But if you go into the theater expecting to take your mind off the hook for a few hours as you watch beautiful people frolic in the sun, you're going to walk out a happy, satisfied camper.  This movie would never make it if it were autumn, sandwiched amongst the heavy handed dramas that cluster at that time of year as they vie for the Best Picture Oscar.  But shuffled into the summer deck, it makes a welcome change from the ""thinking man's"" action films, like ""Matrix"" and ""The Hulk.""  It's fun - really.  That's what I'm stressing here.  LOL!The performances are on a par with the first film, so if you liked Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz in the original, you're not going to be disappointed here.  Robert Patrick falls easily into his small role as a US Marshall, obviously drawing on his experience from the ""X-Files"" (and, on a personal side note, looking doggone sexy as he does it - he's the reason I saw the movie!).  Demi Moore is deserving of all the attention she's received as the devilish Madison Lee; she makes a great foil to the Perfect-as-Punch neo-Angels.  Though having seen the movie, you're left to ask, ""How does anyone do that much fighting in spiked heels?""The only characters who stuck out at me as uncomfortable or unnecessary were Justin Theroux as the vicious Seamus O'Grady, and Bernie Mac as the eternally befuddled Bosley.  Theroux is suitably cruel, but I went through the whole movie wanting to throttle him for trying so hard to sound like William Wallace, when his character is supposed to be IRISH, not Scottish. And Bernie Mac... Bernie, I love you.  You're a comic treasure.  Please, if you're called on to reprise this character in the future, tell McG that you want to spend less time looking like a lost Saint Bernard and more time looking like a slightly goofy but otherwise with-it... administrative assistant (for lack of a better description).The plot is obviously coddled together around some truly awesome action sequences, which are a visual spectacle that you can't help but respect. The sexual under- (and over-) tones are even more prevalent in this film than the original, so parents might want to hold off on taking their kids until they've screened it first.  Don't try to focus too much on the plot, because you'll get a headache.  Just trust that the characters know what the hell is going on, and you'll do fine.The best part of the movie, in this reviewer's opinion, is Crispin Glover, returning as the Creepy Thin Man from the first film.  Instead of playing a wickedly evil villain this time, the Thin Man is now a wickedly evil good guy, who uses his assassin skills to help the Angels in their quest to stop Madison.  A little of his back story is revealed - just enough to be tantalizing, and leave audiences with hope for a return of the character in a third movie, should one be made.  He also has a very sweet, slightly creepy infatuation with Dylan (Barrymore) that is just adorable, in a strange kind of way.  His part is nowhere near big enough - if I'd been writing the script, I'd have titled the movie ""Charlie's Angels II: Return of the Thin Man,"" and gotten rid of Seamus entirely.  Crispin Glover is one of those amazing actors who can make even the most depraved characters sympathetic, without stripping them of their inherent creepiness.  Only Christopher Walken and Steve Buscemi equal him in that regard.  So more Thin Man, I cry!  More Thin Man!My final word: fun.  This movie is fun.  Silly, mindless fun.  Women, if you think only guys will like this movie, take it from me, a fellow female: you'll like it too.  Everyone can find something in this movie to appreciate, from the visuals to the fashions to the storyline (for the brave).  Go, see it, and come out a little more cheerful than when you went in.

By watching and supporting movies such as this we are only fueling the great tragedy of declining quality in Hollywood films today. This will only result in more crud being produced over and over until Cinema as we know it is dead, because nobody will bother spending their hard earned time nor paying their hard earned money for something as lackluster as this.In summary I would describe Charlie's Angels Full Throttle as basically a very bad 106 minute TV commercial at the very best of times.
I too moderately enjoyed the first Charlie's Angel, even if off beat and over the top, not conscribing with the original series, it had some good laughs and enjoyable moments.However this movie is devoid of any plot, reason of anything even remotely worthy of anyone's time.Let me end by saying that I don't usually criticize movies, even the bad ones, which we seem to be getting more and more of, however watching this has made me want to retch and vomit, a feeling even more emphasized when seeing that it actually covered it's costs and was successful at the box office.

If you did like ""Charlie's Angels"" like I did - I strongly suggest you not to watch this one.There's no action, just ""motion"". The scenario is completely senseless - scriptwriters seem to be putting to the test the viewers' tolerance to stupidity. Finally, it's not funny at all. I can conclude that Bill Murray did the right thing, when he rejected a role.What confuses me most, it's the director's name - it's the same name, that was seen in the titles of the fabulous first movie! So I really wonder if Mr. McG has suffered some brain damage in about 2001? P.S.

The plot sucked, the humor was downright weird, and the acting was putrid.******SPOILERS BELOW******Like there's anything to spoil. Basically they were trying to recover HALO disguised in two rings that contains top secret information. They rescued some dude with one of the rings who later turned out to be an antagonist, gee... didn't we see this in the first one? BTW, the first one was brutal as well, but better than this. Then comes the sub plot when Dylan's ex turned up wanting to exact revenge upon Dylan and her friends because Dylan testified against him in court and put him away for many years. Let me tell ya, this guy annoys the hell out me because he friggin' thought he was a terminator. You'll know what I mean when you see him. So Dylan considered leaving the group because she didn't want to jeopardize them, TALK ABOUT CHEESE! If that's not enough topping for ya, how about a little romance between Dylan and ...... THE THIN MAN! What the heck's going on here?I really hope there won't be another sequel to this. But if there is, allow me to write the script for you:Since the angels have the tendency of rescuing bad guys, they should just whack whoever they're assigned to rescue next time right away and get it over with. Then they suspected Charlie of foul play since he's the retard who kept assigning them to these shitty missions, so they whacked his old ass too. While they're still hot on the whacking spree, they whacked Bosley because he's pretty useless without Charlie. Ultimately they thought it would be better to be ANGEL rather than ANGELS, so they plotted against each other and all three got killed in a Matrix style cat fight! YEEEEEAAAAAHH! Oh, did I mention the fight was so intense that it caused a huge earthquake that swallowed the entire production staff. So no more Charlie, no more Bosley, no more Angels, and no more crappy films called Charlie's Angels.Seriously, the only good thing going for this film was the action sequence. But then again every action film's got some flying and CGI graphics. So never mind... this thing's got nothing going for it.

251,spiritedbree102,"Better than the first, but not by far.",8,7 May 2005,"Charlie's Angles movies are the sort of films that you watch for a laugh at the funny parts of it or the enjoyment of watching hot chicks running around doing jobs set by their boss Charlie for the good of mankind. Personally, I prefer watching it for the laughs value as there is some very funny parts in the movie. Everything is good about it except for the fairly mediocre action sequences. OK, I'm being harsh, they're good, but nothing compared to the Matrix or Lord of the Rings.I seem to enjoy commenting on sequels as I have done so for the movies I have reviewed so far. I guess I just like comparing one to another, and in this case, the second only narrowly is better than the first. The first and second aren't really that much different from each other. The laughs are no higher in the second, the action not much different, and the villains are all just the same, with the returning of the weird guy in the first movie who was constantly pulling out the angels hair enlightening the second movie.The acting is fine. Drew, Cameron and Lucy all doing what they do best in their roles. Demi Moore is fine as the evil villain, but really, a decent enough actress could have pulled this off just as easily. The action sequences I saw was similar to the Matrix in a way, although not pulled as nearly as convincingly to the trilogy's work. e.g. There is one scene where the angels seem to be riding in mid-air for 10 seconds on a motorbike. Quite unrealistic. But, it's probably meant to look like that anyway.Overall, this is actually a very easy movie to watch.

That's how I ended up wasting two hours watching ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"". I gave it a 2 because I'm certain there must be worse movies out there, but it is hard to imagine. This one couldn't decide if it was a campy comedy, an action adventure, or a big budget B-movie. It traded on names but was seriously short on entertainment value. I'm sure the script looked better on paper. How they spent $120,000,000 on this is difficult to understand. (Compare to Star Wars Episode VII at $200,000,000 12 years later.)

It's worse than the recent Ultraviolet and has no character development. The jokes and the action sequences were bad and stupid. They contained no reality. Considering that this movie was green-lighted just shows how stupid the studio was to fond it. Diaz, Liu and Barrymore were bad, but I blame it all on the screenwriter and the director. May those guys never ever get to make another movie again. the first time I watched it I thought that it was bad, but not ""crazy"" bad. I then sat down to watch it again with my mother, because she was a fan of the old series. We had to switch it of after 20 minutes. I forgive the three girls for getting involved in this project, but the director should never make a movie again. SPOILERS (Not an important one): The scene where the truck falls down and the three girls escape and ""fly"" into the helicopter was so bad done. I don't blame the VFX-company since Sony Imageworks are among the best in the world, but I blame the screenwriter to make such a scene, that is way over his head.

Did you actually see the sequel without seeing the first one? If you didn't like the first one, why see the sequel? If you liked the first one, what was missing from the sequel that you would give it such a low rating? Bill Murray?? This is why I don't read critic reviews, or the peanut gallery, before I go see a movie. This was a great sequel to this type of movie. It is unrealistic, well over the top action for style and comedy only, played to a Prodigy soundtrack. This is what you got in the first movie, this is what you get even more of in the second.

The only reason I stayed is because I felt like I should get what I paid for, which I now look back and realize how foolish that was.  This movie is just ridiculous stunts with no story at all and just boring performances.  The action isn't good due to the fact that everything is done with a kinda stupid idea to it.  I can't really explain what I mean, but this movie is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.

I mean, it's not just a thin plot, this movie has absolutely NO plot. Every fightscene is completely packed with unnecessary CGI and Bullet-Time effects. Is it so hard for a director nowadays to forget about The Matrix and think about effects on his own? All the fun of the first movie is gone, this movie has no soul.

However I do think that this is terribly hard to believe. I mean first of all I want to know how a man with 2 machine guns shooting both at the same time and not one bullet hit them. Also the grand lorry-or-the-side-of-a-damm scene was I must say shot brillienty the effects are stunningly realistic. Nevertheless, you are saying that we are supposed to believe that Cameron Diaz can start a hellicopter while falling through mid air, that just is not possible because hellicopers have to be started while they are on the ground. Plus if they were to be in mid air for that long the damm would have to be about 25 miles long. Later on the end scene I want to know when Cameron Diaz is on her knees while Demi Moore is going to shoot her the other angels appear with their make-up totally perfect after Drew Barrymore has just fallen from a speeding Porsh and falled down some metal esculators and Lucy Liu has also fallen from a speeding Porsh over another car and smashed through the glass of a shop window.

Correction: BAD weird sexual innuendo. And Demi Moore as the angel-turned-bad?  Blah! Again, a sexy woman, but substandard acting: her performance was flat and passionless. As for the fight scenes:  the martial arts were HORRIBLE! It was a badly choreographed computer-generated matrix-esque MESS! Incidentally, I never went to see Charlies Angels in the theater because the previews made it look so corny -- and even they didn't do justice to the depths of corniness of this atrocity!

If you do that I think you may enjoy the movie as well.  I really liked the first film, and this movie just builds on every aspect of it.  The stunts really do look pretty cool (even though I hated the motor bike scene, that took it to far)I didn't understand why Bruce Willis had to be in it, but OK.  I loved Demi Moore's character, even though it would have been better to find out more about her. Drew Barrymore's character is the only one that the movie bothers to really develop.

If you are a die-hard fan, this film is not for you.If you are, however, someone who watched the show only occaisionally, never watched the show at all, or watched and took the oft-bikini clad babes packing guns and taking names *lightly* (and you're out for a night of guilty pleasure) by all means, see and enjoy this film.  It was artfully crafted for just that purpose.First of all, the stunts.  'Charlie' most definitely challenges the old favorite, 007, in implausible deaf-defying feats and if Die Another Day is any indication, Charlie is now far in the lead.  The chase scenes are breathtaking, the escapes even more so and each one is filled with flames and splashy extravagance.  One scene melts into the next and the viewer is left with their eyes glued to the screen and their mind some 500-odd feet in the air, trying desperately to fling three attractive girls into a moving helocopter without chopping them to bits.The Matrix-like physical combat still skates unbelievable without disolving in the massive cheese factor this movie openly embraces and even a few brainless one liners cannot kill this flick's amazing sense of timing.

It is a mystery - a mystery that anyone would like it. It even lack sex appeal.Maybe McG needs to work on TV with a much smaller budget and less famous actors. He clearly can't get anything from the ""angels"" who seem more interested in laughing than acting. This movie cements their reputations (and Demi Moore's also) as truly bad actors. I don't feel bad for any of them.I don't know about Bernie Mac. Is he that bad, or does he just get horrible roles? The best actors in the first film were Bill Murray and Tom Green. In the second? John Cleese and Matt LeBlanc. This is not what you want.There are several random cameos throughout, not unlike the random plot itself. Much of the movie is a string of T&A, music, pyrotechnics and CG action. It truly is one extremely long music video - like Thriller would look like if created by two monkeys and an ATM machine.I thought the $92 million ""original"" was bad, but the sequel managed to be about $28 million worse.

I love cool, and sometimes unbelievable, special effects and stunts... but this movie serves as a perfect example of what can go wrong when you have too many stunts and crazy action sequences in one movie.  Plain and simple: it just gets boring and ridiculous.  The plot was more mind numbing and jumpy than any action movie I've seen... and that's really saying something.  They throw in characters left and right and celebrities come out of nowhere for no reason during the entire film. The kung-fu fight sequences just did not work in this film (it was done much better in the first Angels movie, if that tells you anything).  Wire work is a cool artform that was just used too much, and often poorly, in this film. A little is good, but if it's not a mystical-kung-fu asian movie with Jet Li in it... then keep the wire-work to a minimum; it just doesn't fit well.This movie wasn't all bad though.  There were a couple pretty cool action shots (note: a 'couple' is about 2) that were done well, but they couldn't redeem the movie in the slightest.  Also, while the movie tried using sex appeal from all female characters, the only sexiness came from Demi Moore, who is probably one of the best looking 40 year old women ever.  It's a shame that she had to make her return to film with this bomb of a movie.If you want to see an action movie gone wrong, then by all means see this film, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

For total escapism & semi clad girls who freely smack each others butt this movie hit the spot with me & my teenage son. If I dwelled too much on plot holes, I would never enjoy another movie.

278,ada-p,"A big fan of the first, bitterly disappointed by the second.",2,7 July 2003,"First I'd like to say that I LOVED the first Angels. I saw it as often as some nuts saw 'Titanic' so you know I speak as a person that loves the direction style and fight choreography. That in mind, this movie stunk. I'm not saying it's dreadful but it really isn't as good as the first. It's like McG over reached with this script and it went from a movie to a video game to down right 'eye-roller'.Demi's role was miniscule for all the hype. The sexy terminator, Robert Patrick, was great as always despite his small role. Bernie Mac; oh my goodness. The guy doesn't tickle my funny bone at all. He doesn't fill the shoes of Bill Murray who had presence. And the bit at the end with the bomb was painfully stupid. If Bill read the script before declining to sign up, I think I can see why he declined even if it were put down to problems with Lucy. The fight sequences were sped up and relied completely on the wires. As another critic said, it looks more like a video game.While the first movie at least orbited around realism (even the dodging bullet bit was well directed) this movie flies off into outer space. Flying from an exploding motor bike and somersaulting onto another in mid air? Actual flying by Demi? I think McG wanted the sequences to be fun but they are overdone and rediculous. And the ending was a bit cheesy. I left the original movie feeling empower and energetic, but left the theatre last night headachy and tired.

The cast are great, the villains are great, the bikini bodies are great and the butt kicking is even better. Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui and Drew Barrymore all play Alex ,Dylan and Natilie with style and Demi Moore is a great bitch. Although what brings it down is the fact Bill Murray does not return and he is replaced by the almost unbearable Bernie Mac who is funny normally, but not in this. Another great character that returns for the sequel is the memorable villain The Thin Man (played Creppyily by Crispen Glover), who we find out more about. Also returning is the great Matt Leblanc who everyone knows famously as the wonderful Joey. There's also a cameo by the great John Cleese, who has his comedy moments.I would say the first Charlies Angels is better but this one is not far behind.

It was almost as though I was watching a very bad rip-off of ""The Matrix"". However, this movie fails in so many other areas as well, such as the dialogue and acting.

The sequel, Full Throttle, was terrible; the best parts of this movie were those that referenced the first. The original movie had cool, silly action and kick-ass music to highlight the fact that this is Charlie's Angels - and not to be taken seriously! The sequel fails completely in this respect; it seems to have a dozen or so music/action sequences already planned out with nothing to string them together. The first movie had the Angels doing totally impossible stunts but you knew it was C.A. and you didn't care. In this movie it was painfully obvious that the Angel's stunts were 100% CGI; they seems to be able to fly, jump 20 feet in the air, walk through fire, and stop time.A total disappointment!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
291,red44,Silly But Acceptable...,5,8 July 2003,"It would be easy to slate this but I'm not going to! Yes, it's a silly film; a ludicrous retro-pop video montage that's heavy-handedly sellotaped together with good will and plot intentions. Yes, it's the thieving magpie of action movies, stealing from the likes of 'Bond' and 'The Matrix' and numerous other action pictures but some of it is choreographed so much better. I'll even forgive the worst Irish accents in filmdom. I laughed, I snorted, I squirmed in my seat and I groaned - it was fun while it lasted and that's more than I can say for some of the other summer blockbusters I've already been subjected to this season. MatriX-2 - you know whom I mean!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
292,ThEjOkErIsWiLd,A TOTAL ABSOLUTE BLAST! PERFECT 10!,10,24 July 2003,"***MINOR SPOILERS***Oh my god, where do I start? Lucy Lieu, Cameron Diaz, and Drew Barrymore, (mmmmmmmmm, drewwwwwwwwwll) return once again as the kick-assing angels! This movie had absolutely everything:Action: The stunts in this movie will have you absolutely agog! totally over-the-top, but that's what makes em ohhhhhhhh so good!From the spectacular 15 minutes to the very last frame, it's pretty much nonstop. Most other commenters have said that they were way too unrealistic, but you know, I always thought the point of seeing a movie was to ESCAPE REALITY for a couple of hours, and this movie lets you do that in every way possible.Villains: Demi Moore stars as the main villain in the movie, and oh my god, for a woman at 40, she looks not a day over 30.. hell, even 25 if you have a good imagination. ;) The other bad guy, Seamus O'Grady, is excellently executed by the GORGEOUS Justin Theroux, and he adds a chill down your spine, especially in one scene where he defies the laws of physics just like the T-1000 in T2... you'll see what I mean ;)Comedy: I really could not help but laugh at all the sexual innuendos in this movie, and I don't usually enjoy Bernie Mac, but as Jimmy Bosely, he had me rolling in the aisle. The ever-classic John Cleese also stars as Alex's (Lucy Liu) father... he was a little more subdued than Bernie, but still a memorable performance IMO.Special FX: Would this be an action movie without them? I think not! The best FX was easily during the motorcycle race, with some very nicely executed ""Bullet Time"" sequences.Music: Oh wow... I couldn't believe how well the music was picked for each action scene... I was dancing in my seat to all the great rocking tunes such as Pink's ""Feel Good Time"" (easily the best track on the soundtrack,) Edwyn Collin's sultry ""A Girl Like You"", and an awesome remake of Sir John's ""Saturday's Alright (For Fighting)"" by Nickelback. This movie also provides some rocking classics, such as ""U can't Touch This"", ""Rebel Rebel"", ""Livin' on a Prayer"", ""Any way You Want it"", ""Surfer Girl"", ""Working For The Weekend"", and ""Last Dance"". Whoever was the sound director for this movie, thank you! Every single piece of music matched whatever was going on the screen excellently.Sex Appeal: ummmm... where do I start? No, seriously, where do I start??? From the absolutely stunning Burlesque show at the ""Treasure Chest"" to seeing the angels in just about every skimpy outfit you can fathom, to seeing *both* Cam and Demi in absolutely saliva-inducing bikinis to the stunning Justin Theroux and Matt LeBlanc (yum!), you can't help but leave the theater with a dirty thought or two running around in your head... Ladies, if you take your man to this movie, you can almost guarantee some steamy hot lovin happening before the night is over... maybe  even right there in the theater, hehe *eg*Overall: Sure, just about every action scene isn't realistic in any way possible, but hey, if you want to see something real, save some money and stare out your window for a couple of hours instead of going to this movie. Otherwise, you are going to *love* it, I sure did!***** out of *****",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Charlie's Angels 2 is just a money making film. A movie made with no good ideas which seems full of improvisations.The only purpose of the film is to show 3 good looking girls wearing little clothing and beating up the most toughest man in the world.It's a B Class movie without any shadow of doubt. Directors! wake up! Don't waste your talent (if you've got any), money and time making this piece of s***.My advise: it's not worth your money and your time. You better off watching TV adverts.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
294,luisperez,Boring!!.,2,14 July 2003,"Well, how can I start my review about this film? It's simply unreal, unoriginal, boring and above all, one big mistake. I know that some people may like this movie, but in my opinion, you can't really thing that having three beautiful girls in the film is enough to have success. Where is the story, screenplay, originality? For me, this was one of my greatest disappointments of all the history of movie industry. To be serious, I almost sleep during the film, and I'm not weird about movies. I like almost everything, from action to love stories. I almost forgot about something, this film is an unoriginal rip-off of The Matrix special effects. The director really spoiled the beauty of those amazing moments from the Matrix.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

This movie is nothing more than entertainment, and it succeeds in that area beautifully!The nods to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Cape Fear and Taxi Driver are hilarious, and the fun romp through the story is quite enjoyable.  This one wasn't as smart about the plot (specifically the doublecross) as the first one was, but that didn't present a major issue for me.  Smart and funny.  In all, if you didn't enjoy this movie, you need to relax and learn to have fun - that's all this is about.  There is a place for fun - it doesn't all have to be ""deep.""  Of course, if you didn't get the jokes (I was the only one laughing at the Cape Fear parts), you need to broaden your horizons and watch some more flicks before you try and enjoy this one.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

297,LaLiss,Terrible isn't harsh enough a world.,1,23 October 2003,"It was...so ridiculous. The out-takes in the credits were better than the movie. I used to respect those actresses, but this was just too much. And how did Bosley turn from a older white man to a younger black one? This isn't explained, is ""Bosley"" a title? Or did they hire him 'cuz his name was ""Bosley""? A -little- explination would be good.  Or is the picture behind his mother there to lead us to believe that Jimmy Bosley is the other Bosley's son?I thought maybe if the movie was good enough, I could ignore Bernie Mac, but he's terrible. The movie was a action packed stripper movie",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

There aren't enough words in the English language to describe how poor this film is. But I intend to eventually combine them all. Bill Murray was right to avoid the sequel but now in hindsight I wish he had passed on the first one as well (the first was a bit better in my view because of Bill Murray). Please save yourself the hassle, I wish I had. I rate it 1/10 only because there isn't a 0/10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
299,AliasHaneke,"Stupid, Unbelievable, Plot less and absolutely FANTASTIC!",8,9 July 2006,"I remember going to the movies hesitant about seeing this movie after all the negative reviews it had been getting, but now after years of DVD viewing, I'm sure glad I did! The movie was just how the critics explained, plot less, unbelievable and stupid, but wasn't that exactly the point? I don't think it was meant to be taken as a serious action film, more of a comedy centered around an action plot.The fight scenes are amazing, while defying almost every law of Physics, they look incredible! They are extremely well choreographed and the matrix could be taking lessons on how to kick ass, with style! The outfits are always great as well, what they're fighting in! Speaking of Outfits, the costumes are all part of the tremendous fun! I think the plot may have been devised around all the costumes! It was true to the original radical costumes of the original TV series. The girls all looked amazing in each of the out fits! All 4 girls kick sizzled on screen in high boots and tight clothes. While the acting wasn't worthy of any academy awards, there was a lot of life and personality in each of the characters, and due to the fact we are familiar with all the characters from the first film, it allows them to become a lot funnier, which is definitely shown in this film.Yes I will admit the plot was stupid and some points i rolled my eyes but the film achieved very highly at what it strives to be: a barrel of fun! And like the entire cast (yes guys and girls) the film is nothing more than delicious eye candy that I can have fun with for hours! HAHAHAHA!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
300,mgoodhew,Holy crapsicle how do they make 'em so bad?!,1,4 June 2006,"At first glance it looks like and action/comedy. But after a few minutes you realize there are no laughs and there's not a single action sequence that has any believability. If I hadn't seen it in my own lounge room, I would have walked out after the title sequence. The comedy is a combination of slapstick and sight-gags that didn't make it into Benny Hill shows combined with word-plays and wit of a somewhat sub-Shakespearian magnitude. For example - it turns-out Drew Barrymore's character changed her name from ""Helen Zass"" (Just imagine me elbowing you in the ribs and winking wile you read that). Also, with all the subtlety of an ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt, it's revealed that not only did Cameron Diaz's character wear her high school's mascot costume: ""Beaver"", but her recently moved-in boyfriend wore his high school's mascot costume: ""Cock"" (oh the humanity)!

As usual, all of the action takes place within 50 miles of Hollywood so that the crew wouldn't qualify for travel and subsistence pay.I tried my best to follow the plot, but somehow I got lost after the first few minutes. Perhaps there wasn't any - just endless improbable jumps and twists.Why would the US goverment keep sensitive records on a pair of ball-bearing shells ? Why was there a hydroelectric dam in the middle of Mongolia manned by ex-East German guards ? Etc. etc...The only thing that kept me awake was waiting for John Cleese to do the funny walk.

I got what I paid for.The action scenes were self-mocking, and fun.  It was not very different from watching a really well played and executed top notch video game... the fight scenes, the motorcycle race, the car chase, etc... all of it was over the top and larger than life -- but I expected that... I wanted that...
People who don't understand that these movies are a farce, should really stick to watching more serious action films.  For those of you who enjoy watching beautiful people parade around doing inhuman stunts in unlikely circumstances... this is the film for you!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
304,bazmaniac,"If you liked the first, you'll get a kick out of this one!",8,24 June 2003,"This movie, like most of its kind copied the first one a little too much. Although some ideas were new and original, most of the scenes were pretty much taken right out of the first.  There was a lot more action, and a lot more scenes that make you marvel at each of the four beautiful women.The main actresses have all returned doing a wonderful job just like in the first one.  Drew Barrymore does an outstanding job playing Dylan as her character is explored deeper.  John Cleese and Matt LeBlanc will make you laugh, especially when Lucy Lu gets into the picture.  However, the best comedy in the movie goes to Bernie Mac.  Ever since I saw Bernie Mac do his `sister's kids' skit, he became my new favorite comedian.  To be honest I was a little disappointed that Bill Murry wouldn't reprise his role, but after seeing Bernie Mac, I didn't care!  He made me laugh so hard during this film I don't remember stopping!  He was a great Bosley, and I'm glad that he got the part!  Demi Moore did a wonderful job as the `fallen angel'. This is the first movie I've seen her in since Deconstructing Harry or G.I. Jane, and personally, I'm glad to see her back on the big screen, especially as a villain!One of my only complaints about the film was how one thing led to another. In most cases it was too far fetched.  At some points in the movie I found myself asking, `Now how did that happen?'  Especially at the end when Demi Moore's character performs a certain stunt.  Although movies don't always have to make sense to be good, the pace went a little too fast for a movie of this sort.Overall I think the movie was very good.  It doesn't surpass its predecessor, but does a very good job trying. If you were a fan of the first one, you will love Full Throttle!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The cartoonish nature of the movie leaves no question: This is escapism pure and simple.Watched on those terms, it was a really fun movie. Is even half of what the Angels do possible? Nope. But that doesn't take away from the enjoyment. The heroes are good, the villains are bad, and the action is furious.Mixed in of course is the expected humour and T&A.

Demi Moore plays her part, so poorly, I couldn't even enjoy the end. The former Charlie's Angels actress, was just gorgeous. And some of the jokes, got severely overused. But Somehow, with the ridiculous scenes (beginning of CSI scene, beach shop) and all the over-effected shocks in their group (the nun scene: the quick flex to the left after Drew pops her gum) i still like this movie.

Now Some may think that i'm wrong and i'm sure there are worse films out there, BUT those other films didn't have as much talent or money behind them. For an estimated $120,000,000 you'd want more, a lot more. The fight sequences are in the 'matrix style' just because they can. Unlike in The Matrix, where there is a good reason why they fight the way they do, the Angels just expect us to believe it and go along with the fun. I would if it were fun. The whole film is just trying to show off, and it doesn't do it well. Every scene with CGI is ridiculously obvious, for the money they spent they got shity results. Then there's the acting, total bullshit, and it's a shame because they 3 leads have all proved that they can act, but here they are caricature's of caricature's and its too far from being believable to even shrug it off in good fun. The film made me angry that so much talent could be wasted in the wet dream of a horribly untalented director with a stupid name. I think you can sum the film up with this; Why did they do it... Because they could. That goes for everything in it, nothing has a real reason. AH it makes me mad. No stars.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

So I get home not expecting much because the first one belonged in the toilet so I should have guessed that this one was no better. So I start the movie and right away I knew I was in for a movie that would just make me mad. How do director and actors that are so bad keep getting work? I could have made a better movie with a group of unknown actors and a hand held camera. My biggest problem with the movie is the final 30min of the movie. When the ""Angels"" are holding on to the car and it hits a search light and the car starts to do roll through the air.

After watching Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle, I had to again readjust these definitions. Hollywood seems to be able to cram more special effects into a movie, with every movie they make.Though there is nothing wrong watching Liu, Diaz and Barrymore accompanied with Demi Moore, in action some might be annoyed by the fact that there are many stunts which seem to be taking place in a world where all the laws of Nature do not apply.All in all, the movie was a nice relaxating movie, and I would certainly recommend you see it, Charlie needs to share his Angels, but if you are in to watching a 'good' storyline, I'd advise you to seek it elsewhere.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Obviously, you should be able to tell right away that this film shouldn't be taken seriously. This movie isn't for the critics at all, it's for the fans and people who are just looking for a good time. It also provides a good message of friendship. Not only do Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Berrymore), and Alex (Liu) have to deal with solving the case and getting the bad guy (or the bad chick) in the end, you get a good sense of just how close they really are, they are three best friends and they make it very clear. The fun that the cast had making the film shows and in turn i had fun just watching them.  There seems to be more showing of the ladies bodies then a*s-kicking, but you remember that they're just doing anything it takes to get the job done and it's fun to watch. But don't worry, there are a lot of fast-paced, over the top action sequences and fight scenes, reminding the ladies that you can be sexy and kick a*s. The characters that stood out to me in this film was Dylan and Madison Lee (Moore). Barrymore still shows that no matter what kind of film she does, whether it be a drama or a fast and furious, sexy, over the top action flick that she is amazing.  Moore is back with a vegence....literally. Her character (which is kind of unknown to me why she exactly she became a ""fallen angel"") was indeed very beautiful but just as she was beautiful, she was dangerous.  She was a suitable villian, though. Madison Lee also had somewhat of a sadness about her. As she once said with a tear rolling down her face: ""I was never good....I was GREAT."" Diaz did good playing the beautiful and dorky Natalie, but at times it was overshadowed by her constant booty shaking. Liu was also great and i loved how she said her dialogue, with such sharpness. Bernie Mac, a king of comedy, didn't really live up to that title in this movie, but he did have some funny moments. Matt LeBlanc turned out to be more funny than Mac. Funny character Justin Theroux makes a good twisted and crazy mad man. He rocked as one of the bad guys. Luke Wilson's character, Pete, still is just adorable and is a good match with Diaz's Natalie. The movie is nothing to pick at. Just sit back and have fun. Don't expect an Academy award winner, expect an MTV Award Winner. Love it or hate it...the one thing that Lucy, Cameron, and Drew want you to do is to have fun, because they had fun making it for you. Overall I would give it: 7/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
330,braino-1,This film is ludicrous rubbish!!!,1,29 May 2006,The film is utter rubbish and deserves a negative rating. Three women who look like nail bar attendants and as intimidating as cheer leaders.Shame on John Cleese for taking a fast buck for his part in this high school garbage.Gratuitous shots of Demi Moore running up the beach to appeal to the fathers of the teen girls who will be dragging them along to see the movie.The motorcycle stunts are comic book stuff and the only redeeming feature is the Prodigy soundtrack.After the first of these films the Angels should have been sent to acting school and not commissioned for another waste of celluloid.,Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Drew Barrymore needs to find a job doing something she is more suited for like bus girl at Denny's. Lucy Liu needs to go back to Asian porn or where ever she came from and Cameron Diaz (what about Mary 1-hit wonder) needs to do a few Clairol hair bleach commercials and all three need to steer clear of the big screen.The only people who will really like and appreciate this movie are young boys between the ages of 12 and 18. they will best enjoy this movie when it is out on DVD and they have it in their bedrooms with lotion and a towel!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Unfortunately, I am one of those people who have to watch a movie they've started to the end, no matter how much it sucks. And this movie is the king amongst vacuum cleaners.It's full of incredibly unconvincing stunts, bad jokes and mediocre acting.

It was literally the worst. Worse than Showgirls. Worse than Dusk 'til Dawn 3. Worse than A Night at the Roxbury. Worse than Barb Wire. It wasn't even so bad it was good. It was just *terrible*. No storyline to speak of. No continuity. Zero believability or interest in the characters. Bad jokes and microscopically thin plotlines.

337,jester101,Basic Review,1,17 August 2003,"After a toss up between Bruce Almighty and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle I narrowly decided to view this pop bubblegum movie, half knowing what to expect.  Boy did I choose the wrong film!  This truly is one of the worst, laziest, feeble movies I have ever had the misfortune to see, and believe me, Ive seen allot of rubbish.  The plot is identical to the first movie (lazy writing).  Something is stolen which allows the bad guys to trace other people (yawn) and the Angels are hired to get it back, but wait, there's another good guy who's not what he seems!  I wont spoil it for those yet to see it but if you've seen the first movie, then you have basically seen this.  The best way to describe the style of this film is to compare it to watching one long music video with bright vivid colours and thumping baselines constantly being thrown at you which ultimately resulted in one big headache.  At times the music is so loud it becomes very difficult to decipher what is being said by the characters.  The characters themselves are truly typecast with the dumb Irishman (with laughable accent), the new black wisecracking Bosley, John Cleese playing the (lets sit down and have a nice cup of tea) bumbling Englishman and Matt LeBlanc playing, you guessed it, Joey from Friends.  We also get to see the return of the Thin Man. But Why.  He adds absolutely nothing to the plot, forwards the story in no way what so ever and is basically a pointless insertion into a pointless film. To top it all we are witness to some of the most ridiculous stunts ever seen.  If you thought James Bond was a joke you aint seen nuffin yet. Within the world of the Matrix we understand why slow-motion happens and how the laws of gravity no longer apply, but why does it happen to the stunts in this movie.  Do the Angels know something we dont?  Please give me an answer.  Ultimately this film is really annoying with too much giggling and sudden bursts of coreographed dancing taking place and not much else. When the best part of the film is the blooper reel within the closing credits you know when you've just seen a complete TURKEY!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The girls are looking good as per usual (Lucy lui and Cameron Diaz in particular). There's quite a few too many sexual innuendos, not exactly a bad thing but it does get tiring and rather unfunny at times.All in all, this film is perfect for going out on saturday nights, it's a quite a no-brainer film but also perfect for those 'hormone-enraged' teenagers. 6/10 - Action/girls 4/10 - plot-wiseOverall - 5/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

346,billyjack90210,McGenius,10,30 June 2003,"With the latest cinematic opus from director Joseph McGinty-Nichol, CHARLIE'S ANGELES: FULL THROTTLE, the audience is treated to a cinematic bauble that refracts the iconography of the classic 70's television series through the sensibilities of one of the most promising American directorial talents of the past 20 years.  Drawing form sources including, but not limited to, The Old Testament and American cinematic history, McGinty-Nichol's film is truly one for the ages.New to this ANGELS installment is Demi Moore, appearing here as former Angel Madison Lee.  With her character, McGinty-Nichol attempts to put a contemporary spin on the Biblical creation myth in which the Archangel Lucifer is cast out of heaven and condemned to walk in shadows til the end of time.  Enraged at being cast out of Paradise, Lucifer searches for ways to strike back at the Creator and his work.  In THROTTLE, McGinty-Nichol has found his Lucifer in the guise of Ms. Moore (returning to the screen from her own cinematic purgatory of the past 5 years).  Throughout the piece, Moore's Madison Lee lurks in the background, biding her time and pulling the strings as she orchestrates her plan to destroy that which Charlie (read: God) holds most dear: His greatest creation - The Angels.Biblical allusions aside, this edition of the ANGELS franchise culls a number of key sequences from a more recent text - namely, the pages of American cinematic history.  Homage is paid to several classic films from years gone by.  RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, CAPE FEAR, and THE JERK are just a handful of the films that McGinty-Nichol tips his directorial hat to.But front and center in this picture are The Angels themselves.  In this go-round, Lucy Liu's Alex (far and away the ""Ice Queen"" of the ensemble in the original ANGELS film) cuts loose and appears to be thoroughly enjoying the proceedings from beginning to end.  Ms. Barrymore's Dylan proves to be the heart and soul of the piece as her character struggles to come to grips with her fear of emotional abandonment.  And last but certainly not least is Cameron Diaz's Natalie.  When Diaz is not flashing her dazzling smile, she continues to prove that she is the most gifted cinematic physical comedienne of her generation.All in all, this ANGELS film is truly a little slice of heaven.It also has a bunch of hot chicks and stuff gettin' blow'd up real good.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Everyone bitched and bitched that the Matrix Reloaded had too much computer generated fight sequences but what about Charlie's Angels???

The action is more exciting, the fight sequences grittier, I was actually able to follow along with the plot, and the acting was a HUGE improvement. Charlie's Angels 2 is fast, loud, and non-stop action--to tell the truth, i had the most fun i had ever had at the theater.This movie currently has a 5.2 rating, which is undeserving. i think the 1st has a 5.9(?) so this atleast deserves a 6.0. I hate to see people bashing this movie and calling it garbage (i think the ""From Justin to Jelly"" and ""Gigli"" boards are for that) because it's far from it. I will admit, some scenes were laughable(The motocross sequence and Madison flying off the building, for example). I think if they had a lower budget it would have been better.

John Cleese barely masking his embarrassment at the frivolity and clueless childish sex bubbling along like a big pink milkshake fountain. The acting isn't particularly bad considering the Python-high-on-winegums style nonsense, which sort of makes you laugh when Lucy Liu is hurled like a throwing star through a shop window in a blaze of sparks and glory from the back seat of an Ferrari Enzo twisting in mid air down Hollywood Boulevard driven by Demi Moore who is having a quite visual fist battle with Cameron Diaz. The coy and quite intelligent references to the Shining (bathroom), Grease (Rydell High reunion) and the coy explanation of the relation between Bernie Mac' Bosley (who is excellent in his skits) and Bill Murray's Bosley from CA1 , considering the sacking of Murray for causing On-set friction.

It's meant to be comedy. If you don't get the humor in Demi's character dressed in underwear and a floor-length fur coat, it simply isn't for you. Some have said that it's a parody of the original TV series. I think it's really just self-parody.I'll grant you that the primary audience of this film is probably 13-year-olds, gay guys and their hags, the plot *was* weak, and it was not as good as the first, which was more understated.

But again, like Mikey, I was pleasantly surprised by the sugar-sweetness of Charlie's Angel Full Throttle. This movie caught me completely off-guard.  I saw Full Throttle at a sneak preview, and I admit that I was not contemplating seeing it otherwise.  As it turns out, it's easily the most entertaining movie I've seen in the first half of 2003.  Now I think I might actually go back to see it again when it's released! What makes this movie work is that it doesn't take itself seriously at all. This movie is as close to a live-action cartoon as I've ever seen, complete with cartoonish sound effects.  The jokes and gags are spot-on 99% of the time, and the audience is never asked to believe that what they are seeing 'could happen.' The director, having a music video background, especially excelled in setting music to the many action sequences.  One could almost think of this movie as a dozen or so mini-music videos held together by short, plot-advancing dialogue scenes.  Congratulations, McG, it worked. The action scenes themselves are heavily stylized works of art.  Some people will be quick to dismiss them as nothing more than ridiculous CG eye candy.  I will disagree with those people.  The stunts performed in the movie only seem 'fake' because they would be completely impossible in the real world, but at the same time, they seem believable within the context of the movie.  It seems like the FX people worked with actual footage of the Angels and made their surroundings CG instead of the other way around.  This gives the characters realistic movement as it's easier to fake a helicopter zooming through the air than a human body flailing about.  Good stuff. I do have a few very minor complaints.  One is that Bosley's brother, played by Bernie Mac, was a bit over the top with his stereotypical 'blackness'. .. so much so that I can see how some African-Americans could find it offense.  Another is that Creepy Thin Man's return is completely unnecessary.  I actually like the character, he just had no place in this movie.  Finally, and this is really silly, I admit, I don't like how the let the movie end without clue-ing in John Cleese's character to what his daughter, Alex, really does for a living.  The left the poor guy believing something totally off in the end! All in all, this movie is a funny, action-packed, and surprisingly tight action/comedy.

367,BossDanmark,This is the worst movie of the year,1,29 June 2003,"This is the worst movie of the year. Nothing - absolute nothing is good in that movie. Girls just want to have fun, but Charlie's Angels is not Matrix or T3. Charlie's Angels is not James Bond. Charlie's Angels is nothing.
Why did it have to be so much like Matrix, James Bond, T3 and all the other? Why not just be itself - with a good story, nice action and some fun.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
368,Scannain,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle - Scannain.com,4,13 July 2003,"Directed by McG, starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Demi Moore, Bernie Mac, John Cleese, Justin Theroux, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson and Crispin Glover.Once upon a time, after a very long time, three lady detectives made the jump from the TV to cinemas. When they did, they brought in one of the biggest hits of 2000 with $124m, and inspired just as many arguments as they had on the small screen about which one of them was the coolest/hottest. Now that they're back for another tug on the cash cow, you can have that argument all over again - but it could prove more memorable than this disappointing sequel.After a gag-filled - but CGI overloaded - opening dust-up in Mongolia, the Angels (Diaz, Barrymore and Liu) are sent to track down two rings containing the new identities of police informants. Mixed-up in this mixed-up plot are a former angel (Moore), an 'Irish' mobster (Theroux) who looks like he spends most of his time at punk gigs and the first movies villain, The Thin Man (Glover).With such a flimsy storyline, stitched around one setpiece after another, '.Full Throttle' runs out of juice the faster it tries to reach a conclusion. Bernie Mac (as the new Bosley) and John Cleese (as one of the Angels' dads) are too funny not to see more of, a very hot/cool Demi Moore deserved far more screen time and the action scenes are so cartoonish you'll give up on them long before the final Hollywood showdown.Director McG and the scriptwriters peddle some nice in-jokes (send-ups of 'CSI' and 'Cape Fear', references to 'Grease', 'The Blues Brothers' and 'M:I2') but never get a handle on turning a great cast and a few decent one-liners and into a fully-formed film. You could chop most of it into three-minute segments, add music and show the results on MTV and there's nothing to suggest that three years down the line either you or these angels should come back for more.Nice outfits, though.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
369,Ianessa,Pitiful with few perks,2,3 July 2003,"If you've heard that since you liked the first Charlie's Angel, you'll probably like this one - think again. I enjoyed the first a lot, but this sequel took everything good about the first movie and exaggerated it ten-fold. What happened McG!?!? Even the characters were exaggeratingly stupid, repeating lines from the first movie and overdoing it. The impossible action that was subtle in the first movie, hit you over the head this time round. As did the use of bullet-time. Three strong independent smart woman were replaced with 3 slutty super genius violent women. Tall Creepy thin man became Tall sleezy thin man. All the characters really turned into parody's of themselves even though in the first movie they really weren't all that deep to begin with. I really missed Bill Murray, Bernie Mac seemed far too gimmicky. On the good side, I enjoyed the soundtrack, the cameos were entertaining, the costumes were colourful and the parody's of everything else were amusing - although very out of place. I truly hope there's no 'next time'.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
370,hofmanna,what the hell?,1,18 August 2003,"This is probably the worst piece of film I have seen so far. The scenes aren't connected at all. It's basically a 2 hour trailer.

This film was pulled off with a lot of style and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I don't see how people could hate it so much. It's not an intellectual film, it's not meant to be.Is it so bad to go see a lighthearted bit of fun? The fight sequences may have been rather matrix rip off but they were better pulled off than in the latest matrix film I feel (even though I loved that as well).My only slight misgivings about the film was occasionally it seemed to be portraying the girls as just nice bodies to look at which seemed to contradict the other more 'girl power' character to them.On the whole though a lovely bit of entertainment with a very fitting soundtrack too.8/10",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

--- MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW ---The script was moronic (why does one character show up to bid on HALO when he already possessed it earlier in the film? Didn't he think to make a copy?), the acting was mostly horrible, and the special effects either unbelievable (helicopter scene) or just plain stupid (is EVERYTHING made of explosive material?). I get the movie references throughout, but that doesn't make the movie interesting OR entertaining.The segment between Matt LeBlanc and John Cleese was good for a few chuckles, which boosted my rating from a 1 to a 2, but this thing is a real turkey.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
373,N7yhn,Not as enjoyable as the first Charlie's Angels movie.,3,30 June 2003,"I was disappointed with 'Full Throttle' because I felt that there was not much story development.  It was quick, quick, quick.  Just a bunch of special effects action sequences strung together, bang, bang, bang.  The first Charlie's Angels movie had a lot of action but, unlike 'Full Throttle', there was also a good story with dialog that made sense and could be easily followed and appreciated.  Lastly, I would have liked to see Bernie Mac given a meaningful script instead of simply being typecast as a goofy black man.  That was not fair to Bernie.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

Though you cant help but think what did 'Charlie' beef the angels up with to be able to do all of those stunts :o)The script is corny and predictable! Nuff said.The ending, well i wont give it away but it does suddenly become very scrambled and all over the place.  I personally got lost in the last 10/15 minutes and couldnt understand what had actually happened or why it happened, script again i guess.it is a sexist film, though you cant help but drool over the outfits (well as a girl I couldnt help, lol) but you do think were some of them really needed!!!John Cleese is appearence was great! and I think Pink was brilliant in her tiny little guest role as the Coal Bowl Starter!  Though there are a couple of twins in the film i really could of done without seeing!!!Overall, if u need to chill out go watch this just dont try and make any sense of it!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
375,PopcornGirl,Full throttle indeed.,4,26 June 2003,"This film starts out at 100 miles per hour and stays constant until the end. To keep up you almost have to be on speed! Also, I have two words for this film: Demi Moore. I want to look like her at 40 too. The angels made the movie cheeky but cute and sweet, and Demi made it raw and entertaining! I wouldn't say that the film is a must-see, but Demi sure is.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
376,andy_ivey,T & A & L,2,27 June 2003,"The L stands for Laughs. There are quite a few good laughs in this picture do in no small part to the presence of Bernie Mac in the Bosley role, and the great John Cleese as Lucy Liu's father. He gets more laughs just from facial expressions than anyone or anything else in the entire picture.As for the substance of the movie... well, the movie has no substance. Its all exterior with no spine. I can definitely say that its still a lot of fun to ogle over the likes of the aforementioned, Liu and her angelic compatriots, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore. With the ""special guest villainess"" addition of Demi Moore to the credits, there's enough curves, bumps, grinds, and slow motion jiggles to make even the most sedate male movie-goer go slack jawed. Its an equal opportunity movie too, the Angels do as much drooling over buff guys in the movie as the guys in the theatre will spend drooling over them.I'd try and explain the plot of the movie if it had a coherrent one. There are some rings or something with data on them, and they fight some guys to get them back. I don't know. Its all a blur now... probably due in part to the brain damage I suffered as a result of the insanely loud special effects. And, given the number of wire jump, slo-mo, bullet dodging fight scenes in this movie, I fully expect the third one to reveal that their whole existence is actually taking place in the Matrix.The bottom line: This movie appeals to the basest of purile entertainment. You go to see this movie for no other reason than to pine after beautiful people and their heavily innuendo laiden adventures and laugh at the sheer 350% absurdity of what is supposed to pass for action.Of course, nothing I can say will dissuade many of you from wasting 2 hours of your life on this disaster, so if I may only offer one piece of advice when you go to the show: leave your brain at home.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
377,bradsherman,A disappointing film lacking the wit and charm of its predecessor.,1,21 February 2004,"I watched this film at the recommendation of my 13 year-old daughter. I like the original film version of a few years ago but Full Throttle lacks the wit and charm of its predecessor. It therefore had to rely on action and special effects which I found boring (and I like action films). The dialogue was weak and, in particular, the special effects were disappointing for this day and age. There was too much obvious work in front of the blue screen and the situations were so preposterous that I eventually gave up on the film after enduring too much of a particularly ridiculous chase. I've only ever walked out on two other films in over 40 years. There is much better entertainment available.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

380,sara_ffm,This is a 100 minutes videoclip...,1,14 July 2003,"While the first movie in some way still had a storyline I was able to follow, this one seemed to me like a randomly arranged bundle of loose sequences...The angels get the order to bring back two extremely important rings and thus have to chase several comic-like characters played by pretty bad actors. Unfortunately, it does not become clear why, for that reason, they have to go surfing or join a bike-race and can't just wait until the guy they are behind is done with the race... Everything is pretty far-fetched and most scenes seem like their only intention is to sell three pretty girls by showing them in real cool, real sexy situations...In order to do so, the film-makers had the girls change their outfits about 500 times. Maybe enjoyable in the beginning, especially for the male audience, after a while, the ever repeating scene of them in a new sexy outfit turning around, with a cool look in their faces while an almost unbearable happy or trying-to-be-real-cool song is playing in the background just simply becomes very boring...I had the feeling, I was watching a never ending video clip. Very colorful, very fast, lots of music, no need for logic and some weird story. And the weak plot could have easily been told in a three minutes clip.The action sequences though were definitely entertaining, although completely over the top and thus more amusing than in any way thrilling...",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

The script just isn't as good, however, with some reiteration of some of the jokes from the first movie.
There is a stronger focus on Cameron Diaz' sex appeal in this movie than in the last one; Drew Barrymore isn't as vamped up this time around. Don't get me wrong, I love Drew's glam-rock theme clothes - but she just doesn't live up to the post modern Monroe figure that she so gloriously played in the last movie and while Cameron is a brilliant comedienne (I could not believe her impersonation of a uber-butch female superintendent) she's just not as sexy as Drew. Among the villains Robert Patrick is good in his subdued role (wish they would use him more - his villain-talent is infinite), the Irish guy is no good, creepy thin man is a genius and Demi Moore makes her best performance to date. Gosh, I hope she'll get the chance to play Snow white's evil step mom, because that's her destiny. 7/10.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

That didn't even help make this movie any more entertaining. This movie was a cheap ploy just to bring people to the theaters and make money, not caring weather the moviegoers enjoyed it or not. The script may be the EXACT reason why Bill Murray decided not to join the ORGY! The action used in this movie was the same cheap action they used in the first Charlie's Angel's. If I remember correctly the original Television show didn't use the butts of their characters to be the butt of the jokes. And for no apparent reason they had to make Demi Moore run to her car in slow motion instead of walk to her car, the running had NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER in the film. Little sidenote she did look good for 40. If all that doesnt pursuade you to not waste your money then you should hear the plot. They are trying to recover two stolen rings which when put together will reveal the identities and location of everyone in the witness protection program...HUH??? You figure it out.

When we arrived at the theatre the only movie beginning was Charlies Angels:Full Throttle.I didn´t think it would be a great movie but i was in a good mood and wanted to give the movie a chance to prove itselfe. WRONG, a very WRONG thought. It must have been the worst movie i have seen in years if not ever.
The stunts they pulled in this movie are so unrealistic it´s no fun anymore. In james Bond you have the same feeling that it´s unrealistic but he can do did, because he´s the king in that kind of stunts. In Charlies Angels they even went further then he would ever go.Also the script was very lame with a very weak storyline. Bad guy steals something that can harm the good guys and they go after it. The jokes are very bad in this movie and i haven´t laughed once during this movie.So my conclusion is. Don´t go there it´s a total waste of money and time, please go see a movie that is somewhat better then this one (shouldn´t be hard to find).",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle

I really hope they were trying to be corny because that was the worst piece of acting I have seen from Drew, Cameron, and Lucy.

I know the film is supposed to be somewhat unrealistic, but it should honestly be changed to a sci-fi flick with all the Matrix-like wire stunts and bullet time that was used.  The dialogue was absolutely horrible as well.  These writers made more stupid catch phrases than a bad Steven Segal movie.  I have little more to say since I never even want to think about this movie again.  I've lost all respect for Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lu, (Drew Barrymore was never high on my list to begin with) and I hope they can redeem themselves with better movies.

Charlie's Angels, the tv series, was full of camp, and over-the-top antics and did exploit the use of sexy women. The movie(s) are based on this very notion, meaning that if you go to see the movie, you're going to see some campy-spoof, with some heavy moments, of a campy 70's show.If you're into a fast and fun movie, filled with lots of action, noise and over-the-top scenes, then Charlie's Angels is for you! It's got a lot of great action, and even though it seems pointless, it's fun! Isn't that the whole point for seeing a movie in the first place - to have fun? I love drama, and other sorts of movies, but you really can't expect it from Charlie's Angels!The one thing that is at the center of the movies, of course, is the chemistry between Natalie, Alex, and Dylan. Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore have a wonderful chemistry together and they make things fun, yet sincere.This movie, with the addition of Demi Moore, ROCKED! It was a solid kick ass movie. It's just about fun, enjoyable and uplifting girl power at it's best!

""Do not take this movie seriously, and you will enjoy it"" was one of the quotes I say from a favorable review.  Basically, if you realize this movie is going to suck and be possibly the worst thing ever made, go see it and you will not be disappointed.  ""Girls kicking but and Girl Power"" was another rediculous comment.  Tell little girls this is about girl power when all these clowns are doing is running around half naked and acting like 1950's barbie dolls is a great way to show them how to succeed.

I've read some of the existing reviews of ""Charlie's angels: Full Throttle"" on this site and already I've come across users whose pets have obviously died. How else can one be so disgustingly bitter about a movie.This movie is, on the whole an entertaining one. I am a big fan of stories on any platform: Movies, books, computer games, and yes the plot in this movie is a little here and there. But, when a movie is this entertaining, so what if the story just doesn't click. I don't think the writers aimed to get beautiful piece of Shakespearian work. The story that is in place at least gives us an idea of what is going on and why the impressive set pieces occur, and for a brain-less action flick, that is all that is necessary.The beginning sequence made the one in die another day look like a child's playset, the humour throughout the movie worked, and Lucy Liu was her sexy self in this movie. Demi Moore looks fantastic for her age and my friend and i argued afterwards who was sexier, Lucy or Demi, I obviously thought Lucy.This in my opinion is more of a masculine movie, skimpy garments on the ladies, lots of action and two beautiful looking desert eagles held in the beautiful hands of the stunning Demi Moore.So to finish, the movie is stylish, funny and very entertaining. This is achieved without a strong plot and aided by a blatant rip off the cover of mission impossible 2 within the movie. I say see this movie if you are looking to enjoy yourself, but steer clear of this movie if you are a angry critic who is desperate to write for empire magazine.

405,piper_marie_p3,this movie rocks,10,2 August 2003,"I love this move, it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. 100 times better then the first. and demi moore looked stunning for her age. i have seen this movie 5 times so far and plan on going again. the actors are great and the plot although hard to understand the first time is entertaining. i recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first.lucy liu and demi moore rule!!!!!!!!!1",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
406,xxk8_ya_m8xx,Great...Bring it on!,10,4 August 2003,It is great for both men and women it is basicly alot of fun I could certainly watch it over and over again! Please make more in the sequel it is great fun to watch. Overall when me and my mates saw it we had a laugh aint' that all that matters?!,Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
407,escobar-4,A movie like no other,10,5 August 2003,"The first thing you need to do with Charlie's Angels 2, is to view it at the right aspect. Trying to see it as a serious action movie is a disastrous choice. Charlie's Angels 2 is not in any way intended to be a drop-dead serious action film. It is a self-parodying The viewer should get this at the latest when Natalie (Cameron Diaz) steps into the bar. After that, the movie sucks you in and doesn't let go until the the last minute is up. McG has done a great job directing a movie which takes a firm grip of the viewer, as nothing is allowed to go on for too long (his experience with music videos really shows). The best thing about CA 2 is that it really cheers you up. This really isn't a easy job, but Liu, Barrymore and Diaz are successful in it. Leaving your critical point-of-view at home isn't necessary at all as the movie is a great mixture of parody, comedy and action, stylishly done and ready to be enjoyed.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
408,r-vdree,fun to watch,7,5 September 2003,"This is not a great story, but if you just want to be entertained, this is one you shouldn't miss!! Of course, Cameron Diaz is very funny and Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore are very nice to watch as well. there is no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
409,icdrag0n,Terribly disappointing,4,4 October 2003,"The first was fresh and cool, yet this sequel to an above-average action flick left me gagging and violently pressing the [Eject] button. The stunts are ridiculously impossible and unrealistic, the plot is somewhat cheesy and cliched, and the acting is of a lower quality than that of the first. Only die-hard fans should see this movie, and I doubt it would please even them.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
410,bowieandelfmanfan13,"If you are looking for substance, look elsewhere...",6,30 September 2005,"As the summary says. This movie is fairly poor in quality. The story is very confusing, and most of the plot points make no sense. Basically the only point to this movie is to see the angels in revealing outfits, which I find degrading. Also, the stunts weren't very impressive, and the script was dull and had no laughs.The only reasons I gave it such a high score (and that I watched it) are that the David Bowie song/reference and Crispin Glover's brilliant performance. It's a shame that his appearance is mostly a cameo, and that he does not appear constantly throughout the film. Crispin is the only reason I kind of liked this movie.If you're a Crispin fan, look elsewhere!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
411,HollywoodYuck,"Farrah, come back!",1,29 November 2003,"Obviously targeted to males ages 8-14, with lots of action and empowered young ladies in bikinis.  Embarrassing, silly, mindless, unbelievable. This is acting?  Spectacular special effects, obviously going for licensing opportunities (video games, breakfast cereal premiums, etc.) The old TV Angels were much better looking, and the plots and situations were almost plausible.  A painful experience.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
412,Yo_simple_plan_fan,The best Movie i have seen this year.,10,29 November 2003,This is the best movie i have seen all year the fact that it is better than the first on cause the is more of a problem the work harder and that there is more stunts and the truth about 1 of the angels.This is is the greatest and it is a little bit funnier than the first on because of Bernie Mac.,Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
413,chocobobuk,Why does everyone hate it?,9,29 March 2005,"If you ask most people about this film they will respond that they hated it and, as one user put it ""everyone who liked it should be lined up and shot"" but I don't understand why. OK so the plot is a bit ""strange"" (in YOUR opinion, not mine) but, if you wanted to see a deep, intense film then I don't know why you went to see this one. It is a feelgood movie, and it pulls THAT off expertly. I love the witty one liners such as ""please I dated fat women...couple of midgets"" from Bernie Mac as the new Bosley. The plot is ""strange""...but it works!! The idea of a 'fallen' angel is brilliant, I think, and Demi Moore, Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore's talents shine through. There are also brilliant cameo's from John Cleese, Shia LeBouf, Jaclyn Smith, Justin Theroux and Crispin Glover as the thin man. All in all this film is brilliant and I sincerely hope a third one is made!",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
414,h_nichelle,"Fun, Action Packed Girl Power Movie",7,25 January 2005,"First let me state that Charlie's Angels is not The Graduate or The Color Purple. Charlie's Angels is a Fun, Action Packed Girl Power movie, not a submission of fine film for the Actor's Studio. It's a movie not a film, Dr Pepper not Champagne. If you are looking for a movie to expand your mind, this is not it. If you are looking for a movie that has beautiful women, cool FX, and cheesy one liners, this is your movie. So order a pizza, grab some popcorn, hop on the couch and ENJOY!Charlie's Angels is fun and enjoyable. What else do you want from a remake of a 70's TV show.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
415,MarvelGirl44,!,1,15 July 2004,"BAAAD! Stupid movie. Stupid stunts. They only reason I think they made this movie was too show off three actresses' bodies. It was a horrible movie with stupid mistakes. For example, one moment the guy has no shirt on (again) but he is in full motorcycle gear in the next second or two. Crazy awful stuff. In the first movie, the stunts were pretty fake, but this one is terrible. I just want one of them to die because there are somethings that no way could they all survive after surviving the horrible explosion they were just in right after they kicked a hundred trained assassins' butts (I know I exaggerate). Also, in one part they jump out naked only to have to change into clothes. Why don't they just wear clothes in the first place. So stupid. I must admit that I liked the relationship thing between Natalie & Pete in this one just like in the first one. I just think that this movie was a waste of time and it did not pass the sequel test. It was one of the worst I've seen actually.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
416,rpgn,An insulting mess of crap,1,4 April 2013,"Just awful. For a start, even when this film asks you to suspend belief in the name of cheesy entertainment it's impossible to do so because the action scenes are so inane and inaccurate.The first scene is a prime example: The Angels are discovered trying to free a prisoner from a Mongolian tavern. Facing off against twenty men one of them slides under a table doing some kind of limbo manoeuvre, while another jumps across the frickin room and slides into place next to her buddies on a chair. Then when they are fired upon by a guy with a massive gun they fly vertically into the air missing every bullet! The next shot has them jumping horizontally through windows! NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE!!! Where's the consistency? It's an insult on our intelligence to actually watch.And it just keeps going and going with crap scene after crap scene.And what's with the weird in-joke with the thin man? ITS JUST PLAIN BIZARRE!!!Watch if you are looking for a film to ridicule and roll around laughing about how terribly made it is. Do not watch if you want a coherent film.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
417,paolodiablo,Fun!,9,10 January 2005,"Does exactly what the target group (me!) wants it to do: it's not high art but a fun ride thru and thru. It's loud, it's fast, and it doesn't have much of a brain - just as I imagine such a movie! Really, if you expect anything more than perfectly choreographed fights, hilariously cheesy one liners and a lot of 'beauty shots', you better look for something else. I know that many people hate it, but it's in the same category as Armageddon and many other stupid action movies: lots of fun but nothing you'll have to concentrate on. Just lean back, have Coke, nachos and a lot of cheese sauce handy and enjoy the girls kicking ass in comic fashion! Personally I give it an 8.5/10. It's one of the best in it's sub genre.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
418,josephtweddle,"Explosive, Dynamic, GIRL POWER",10,22 July 2018,"This film falls into the rare category of being a sequel that is better than the first! Liu, Diaz and Barrymore are enchanting, their stunts and dialogue: movie perfection! Packed with intense action scenes, 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' explodes on the screen, while managing to distinguish each character perfectly. Demi Moore captures the true essence of a Hollywood villain, creating aspects of darkness to the movie as a whole. The comedy aspects land perfectly; Bernie Mac being a true standout. A true masterpiece.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
419,craigmilton4667,Axl Rose,8,8 April 2006,"On Charlie's angels 2, Bruce Willis plays a man named William rose Bailey. It probably isn't on purpose and just a coincidence but Axl Rose from the band Guns n' Roses, his surname is Rose, William ROSE Bailey, and Axl's real name is William Bailey making up William Rose Bailey, weird huh, i noticed this when i was watching the film the other night, i have never noticed this before, i also noticed some goofs, such as the fact that you can see the microphone when Madison lee played by demi Moore, is talking to Charlie on the speaker-box, and that the remote seems to be stuck on the t.v when Matt le blanc and Lucy lui carry it, and at the angles they carry the t.v it should really have fallen off",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
420,ACtheLegend,Really cool movie! See it now!,10,30 December 2005,"This is the sort of movie you go to into the theatre knowing that it's going to be a lot of fun. It's not an all out serious action movie or a total slapstick comedy. It's the kind of film that gives you a laugh, as well as showing off some nifty special effects. There are moments of heart were you really connect with the characters and ones were you can laugh along with them.I congratulate McG and his team on a phenomenal job for making this sequel every bit as enjoyable as the first one, if not more enjoyable. Well done guys, you got it right! My advice is buy this movie and take a 106 minute journey into a world were you can just kick back and relax with pure fantasy and have a great time doing it.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
421,echoelman,Sugar-coated crap dipped in stupidity and poured onto a DVD.,1,22 December 2005,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and yes, I have sat through Manos, Girl in Golden Boots, and Daredevil (all with the aid of MST3k, of course...disregarding Daredevil, which somehow manages to surpass this ""movie"").The words that fly from the mouths of the Angels, often being incoherent, poor excuses of sexual innuendo that have no relevance to the plot, will make your brains ooze onto the floor. See that? That's your frontal lobe, where most of your thinking occurs in your brain. That's what the writers of this flick and director McG are missing.The Angels and their enemies often defy the Laws of Physics in ways that make all three Matrix movies look not only believable, but something you'd expect in day to day life. Not only that, the special effects are so terrible it looks like some amateur merely used Photoshopnay, MS Paintto crop the Angels into different positions for every other frame. All of the other flips and jumps are done very convincingly; ""convincingly"" meaning ""I can see the damn ropes flinging you into the air."" On top of that, none of the action is all that entertaining in the first place, just the standard punching, kicking, choking, and licking (more on that later) that you see in any B-action-movie, with a few explosions here and there. It's like a donut of crap glazed in sewage and filled with garbage. Utterly pointless.Do I dare delve into the plot? Well, it's mainly the girls running to different locations in different costumes for no reason, disregarding the two completely ridiculous transitions where they use their senses of taste and smell. Here's a spoiler: some kid (vital to the plot as he is, I forgot his name. Right.) has his parents killed at the beginning of the movie, and miraculously has a recovery time of zero. By the end of the movie, he's all smiles when he learns he was adopted by Bosley's family (whose existence in the movie, along with Bernie Mac, was to provide stereotypical loud Black humor). The rest of the plot is basically Demi Moore trying to kill Charlie, and if you didn't know that her character was evil before seeing the filmwell, it doesn't really matter anyway, does it?But the most mindblowing aspect of the movieeven more mindblowing than seeing the grotesquely skinny Cameron Diaz, the somewhat attractive Lucy Liu (I blame the stage lighting and makeup crews), and the totally out of place Drew Barrymore all scantily clad in the stripper sceneis when Demi Moore, holding Cameron Diaz at gunpoint and droning through her Evil Mastermind Monologue That Gives the Hero a Chance to Totally Ruin her Plans, LICKS Diaz's FACE. LICKS it as she is about to blow out her brains. The remote almost flew into the TV, which would have been followed by the PS2, and then finally my own head. Anything to stop the madness.I don't care if this is supposed to be action-movie porn. Do yourself a favor and just watch a trainwreck full of beautiful naked women instead. That'll save some time, money, and maybe three or four billion braincells.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
422,iloverocknrole,Good film,7,26 November 2005,"I thought this film was really fun....i did enjoy it better the second time i saw it, have no clue why. Lucy Liu is my favourite in it as is her boyfriend (Matt Le Blanc)who provides several bits of comic humour. Camon Diaz provides the ditsy, giggly side of the film and Drew Barrymore the kick ass needed. I think this is a great film, it is funny and has great action scenes as well as a very clever plot. There is a moment or two where you feel a bit awkward because the bit they thought was funny really wasn't but on the whole very enjoyable. I think this is more of a girl film as the fighting is not bloody or gruesome but fun and more amazing stunt moves than weapons and blowing people up that boys often seem to enjoy.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
423,erwi36,Charlies Angels,9,9 January 2006,"It is just entertainment and my daughter loves to watch them over and over. As a matter of fact, she has been taking lessons in Karate because of Charlies Angels.She would love to see more movies and more empowered women take action and do what is right in this world. She is way too tired of watching the Power Puff Girls. She would love to see the Desoto Case. And would like to know who Charlie is, because my wife and I will never tell.She would also like to see more Angels, past or present. Does not matter, but it shows her that women can be smart, intelligent, and most of all empowered to take charge over their own lives.EricNot necessarily a preview, but a comment.",Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle
